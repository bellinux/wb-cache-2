The next day, while shopping for tuxedos, Sydney asks Peter why he is marrying Zooey, and also asks for an $8,000 loan. After some thought, Peter decides to lend Sydney the money, and later grants him the honor of being best man at his wedding. Zooey, meanwhile, has become suspicious of Sydney. Peter tells Zooey that he lent Sydney money and asks her if she <b>knows</b> <b>why</b> they are getting married, since he had no answer to Sydney's question. Hurt and angry, Zooey leaves.|$|E
500|$|Critic Grace Dent has likened Dot and Jim to [...] Coronation Streets Hilda and Stan Ogden, {{comparing}} a {{scene in}} EastEnders where Dot nags Jim and he prays for a quiet life to a similar one from Coronation Street, that aired decades before. Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: [...] "Initially, Jim wasn't {{the sort of person}} that Dot approved of. He drank, he gambled, he lied– he wasn't reliable at all. But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot– heaven <b>knows</b> <b>why!</b> I think that you always have to work out for yourself how you can make the character work in a new situation. I could see that Jim was kind to Dot [...] His kindness drew her towards him. [...] Dot's definitely in control of Jim. She quite enjoys bossing him around." [...] Brown stated that she enjoys her screen partnership with John Bardon, saying [...] "We work very well together– he's got great timing and he can be very tender too." ...|$|E
500|$|The next day, Cort {{is slated}} to fight Spotted Horse, an American Indian who claims he [...] "cannot be killed by a bullet". The Lady, still upset over killing Dred the night before, saddles up and rides out of town before Cort's fight. Cort {{narrowly}} beats Spotted Horse after having to beg for a second bullet. The Lady is found at a nearby cemetery by Doc Wallace, who tells her that he recognizes her and <b>knows</b> <b>why</b> she is there. During flashbacks, it is revealed that the Lady's real name is Ellen, and father {{used to be the}} Marshal in Redemption until Herod invaded, killed all the deputies and had him strung up. Herod gave Ellen a pistol and three shots to try and break the rope her father was hanging from, but she accidentally killed him. Doc Wallace tells her that Herod's men dug up her father's body and burned it. He hands Ellen her father's old badge and begs her to come back and help rid the town of Herod, as she and Cort are now Redemption's only hope.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Isaac Hempstead-Wright, who portrays Bran Stark in the series, Wright {{was asked about the}} significance of Bran witnessing the scene at the Tower of Joy, saying [...] "I don't think Bran <b>knows</b> <b>why</b> this is significant, but he knows that it is significant because he wouldn't have seen it if it wasn't earth-shattering, because everything we've learned so far during his visions has been pretty big and important, from the creation of the first White Walker to the origins of Hodor. This is clearly another important milestone in the history of Westeros. For Bran, he sat there sitting, 'This isn't my brother. This is my cousin somehow, but who's the dad? And why have I been shown this? If I find out who the dad is and why I need to know who the dad is, then let Jon know quick.'" [...] The scene reveals neither Lyanna Stark's son's name nor his father's, with the transition between the newborn's face and Jon Snow's visually conveying the identity. HBO released an infographic shortly after the episode aired, confirming Ned Stark as Jon's guardian, and Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen as his parents.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{broadcast}} in Australia on the Seven Network on 6 June 2002. Robin Oliver for The Sydney Morning Herald wrote [...] "Unlike {{any of the}} other seemingly compulsory Oz adventures to which British TV panders, this one presents a superior storyline while soaking up the views." [...] Oliver complimented the performances of Gary Sweet and Kimberley Joseph, and Ciaran Donnelly's direction. The Ages Debi Enker was critical, decrying the plot as [...] "fairly creaky" [...] and the locations as [...] "a very glossy ad for the sights of Sydney". She also thought Gary Sweet and James Nesbitt looked bored in their roles. In New Zealand, the episode was broadcast on TV ONE on 17 September 2002. The New Zealand Heralds reviewer Michele Hewitson was critical of the clichés in the script, particularly the stereotypical characterisation of Rod Ellison, who she described as [...] "a bit of a bastard". Hewitson was also critical of Karen's reaction to David's attempts to repair their relationship, and concluded by writing, [...] "God only <b>knows</b> <b>why</b> they had to drag the entire cast all the way to Australia. You can take this lot out of Manchester but they'll still be moaning, angst-ridden and selfish." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} on 7 November 2007 that Abra would again {{be returning to}} Holby City, in spring 2008. Edmondson revealed that [...] "Abra comes back as a patient because some trauma has happened in Africa {{and he will be}} sponging off Ric." [...] Expanding on this, he explained: [...] "Abra’s in a very fragile state, as he’s suffering from post-traumatic stress. He keeps hurting himself, but no one <b>knows</b> <b>why.</b> Ric’s pretty off with Abra at first, but he agrees to let him stay at his place for a week. Abra used to be a nice guy, but he’s horrible now. Something happened to him on his travels, though even I haven’t been told what it is yet. What I do know is that Abra has a huge machete scar on his back... I imagine he’s been though some horror." [...] He has stated that this appearance in the show will last four or five months, and that he doesn't yet know how the character will be written out this time, beyond there being [...] "some kind of mental-health issue." [...] It emerged that Abra had borne witness to a violent attack on the hospital he was working in the Congo, eventually leading to him checking into a psychiatric unit. After being discovered being treated by his own mother, Kyla and Lola Griffin convinced him to discharge himself and return to Ghana. He returned briefly to Holby in December 2008, when he convinced Kyla to move to Ghana with him, proposing marriage to her.|$|E

500|$|David Renwick {{made the}} {{decision}} to revive Jonathan Creek for a Christmas special as a means of [...] "deferring retirement". He considered the alternative of developing an entirely new series to be too lengthy a process, and regarded reviving Jonathan Creek as the [...] "safe decision". He described the process of formulating a plot for the episode as an [...] "agony" [...] and a [...] "torment", revealing that he had stopped writing the show in 2004 partly {{due to a lack of}} ideas. Renwick explained: [...] "Inevitably, you set up a series which is all about impossibilities that then have to have a rational explanation, by definition it’s going to be pretty challenging stuff for a writer. So God <b>knows</b> <b>why</b> I ever embarked on it in the first place." [...] As well as writing, Renwick also directed the episode, which was produced by Nerys Evans; Jonathan Creeks former Producer Verity Lambert died of cancer in November 2007. Davies noted that he and Renwick met quite regularly following Lambert's death, and when Renwick suggested to the BBC that they revive Jonathan Creek, the broadcaster [...] "bit his hand off for it". [...] "The Grinning Man" [...] was commissioned by Jane Tranter, Controller of BBC Fiction, with Lucy Lumsden, Controller of Comedy Commissioning, stating that the station was [...] "delighted to have Jonathan Creek back on BBC One". Renwick was prepared for a negative reaction to the show's revival, describing how: [...] "People say, Oh Jonathan Creeks coming back. Fantastic.' And then they watch it and go: 'God, what a mistake.' Which is what happened with One Foot in the Grave. So I tend to expect the worst." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 2006 Victorian state election, {{there was}} {{increased}} bitterness between Labor and the Greens. Labor direct-mailed {{a letter from}} Peter Garrett to voters in its threatened inner-Melbourne seats claiming that the Greens were preferencing the Liberal Party, in spite of Greens preferences being either for Labor or being open. Following the election, The Age's Paul Austin wrote [...] "Labor's campaign manager, state secretary Stephen Newnham, reckons he <b>knows</b> <b>why</b> the Greens' support fell away {{in the last days}} of the campaign. He has told cabinet and caucus members it was because of Labor's loud assertions that the Greens had done a secret preferences deal with the Liberals".|$|E

[...] Most Armenians and Azerbaijanis were also dissatisfied with the trials. Armenians complained that the true instigators of the pogrom were never caught whereas Azerbaijanis stated the sentences were too harsh and were upset {{with the fact that the}} trials were not held in Azerbaijan. Some Azerbaijanis even went on to campaign for the [...] "freedom for the heroes of Sumgait."
