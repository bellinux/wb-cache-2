5|$|In response, ETOUSA {{initiated}} Operation Peppermint. Special <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> prepared. Eleven survey {{meters and}} a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which {{were used to}} measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with the highest priority. Chemical Warfare Service teams were trained in its use, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance. The <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> held in readiness, but the preparations were not needed, because the Germans had not developed such weapons.|$|E

The major subcategories of transport <b>equipment</b> <b>are</b> conveyors, cranes, and industrial trucks. Material can also be transported manually using no equipment.|$|R
5000|$|ULV <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> {{designed}} to produce very small droplets, thus ensuring even coverage with low volumes. The <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> based on aerosol, air-shear (mistblowers, exhaust gas sprayers) or better still, rotary nozzle techniques.

50|$|A. Weighted value basisOne {{method for}} {{determining}} VOWD for major <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> based on weighted values of items of equipment.At {{the outset of}} the project a list of <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> prepared, and the weighted (%) value of each piece of equipment, with the sum of the weighted values of all items totaling 100%.When an item of <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> received on site the percentage contribution of that <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> added to the previous months weighted value of all other equipment to determine the total cumulative percentage value of equipment received on site.The VOWD of major <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> calculated by multiplying the weighted percentage value of all equipment received at site by the total current approved contract value of the Major Equipment scope.|$|R
5|$|In the {{six years}} after Beulah, no {{seedings}} were conducted for several different reasons. In 1964, measurement and observation <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> not ready to be used. The year after that, all flights were used for additional experimentation in non-hurricane clouds.|$|E
5|$|Infantry units mostly {{fought in}} close order as did their forebears from the Principate. Infantry <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> broadly {{similar to that}} of {{auxiliaries}} in the 2nd century, with some modifications (see Equipment, below).|$|E

5|$|Standard gauge {{operations}} {{began in}} 1894 with five locomotives, and the narrow gauge <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> kept temporarily for commuter runs to Blue Ash. Later acquisitions, {{as well as}} consolidations with other companies, raised the number to 23 in 1920, its final year of independent operation.|$|E
5|$|The Windlass Room, or Winch Room, {{is in the}} Gatehouse, entered {{from the}} Drawing Room. It {{contains}} a working mechanism for operating the drawbridge and the portcullis. The <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> originally intended for the second floor, which Burges considered the most historically authentic location. When later design modifications led him to move Lord Bute's Bedroom into that space, the <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> simplified and placed on the first floor. The Windlass Room includes murder holes, which Burges thought would have enabled medieval inhabitants of the castle to pour boiling water and oil on attackers.|$|E
5|$|The {{disposal}} of surplus military equipment {{took place at}} the same time as the size of the services was being reduced. The disposal process was managed to limit its economic impact. Most <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> transferred to other government agencies, sold or destroyed by the end of 1949.|$|E
5000|$|Equipment and {{facility}} requirements are {{dictated by the}} product(s) being manufactured. Process <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> typically constructed of stainless steel or plastic. Stainless steel <b>equipment</b> can <b>be</b> cleaned and reused. Some plastic <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> disposed of after a single use. [...] Products manufactured for medical or food use must be produced in facilities designed and operated according to [...] Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations. Cleanrooms are often required to control the levels of particulates and microorganisms. Sterilization and aseptic processing <b>equipment</b> <b>are</b> required for production of injectable products.|$|R
50|$|The {{property}} at 2700 Hardy Street was foreclosed, and {{the property and}} <b>equipment</b> <b>were</b> sold at auction on June 25, 2013 for $375,000. The property and <b>equipment</b> <b>were</b> used to establish the James River Distillery.|$|R

5|$|A {{statement}} {{issued by the}} National Weather Service advised people in nine Florida counties to complete hurricane preparations, which included securing loose objects and moving watercraft to safety. Homes along the coast were boarded up by their owners, while offshore, workers were removed from oil platforms. A spokesman for Royal Dutch Shell reported that 800 workers were to be evacuated. In New Orleans, emergency <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> readied and inspected. The New Orleans Levee Board went into a second-stage alert on September 21, and cleared debris from floodwall openings.|$|E
5|$|Alvarez {{assembled}} {{a team of}} physicists and archeologists from the United States and Egypt, the recording <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> constructed and the experiment carried out, though it was interrupted by the 1967 Six-Day War. Restarted after the war, the effort continued, recording and analyzing the penetrating cosmic rays until 1969 when Alvarez reported to the American Physical Society that no chambers {{had been found in}} the 19% of the pyramid surveyed.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Ju 87 A-0, the B-1s were {{returned}} discreetly to the Reich. The {{experience of the}} Spanish Civil War proved invaluable - air and ground crews perfected their skills, and <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> evaluated under combat conditions. The Ju 87 had not been tested against numerous and well-coordinated fighter opposition; this lesson was learned later at great cost to the Stuka crews.|$|E
50|$|Life-support <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> an {{integral}} part of diving, and dive <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> generally robust and reliable, but bad maintenance, design flaws, improper use, or other factors may cause or contribute to an incident.

5|$|At {{the base}} of the rank pyramid were the common soldiers: pedes (infantryman) and eques (cavalryman). Unlike his 2nd-century counterpart, the 4th-century soldier's food and <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> not deducted from his salary (stipendium), but was {{provided}} free. This is because the stipendium, paid in debased silver denarii, was under Diocletian worth far less than in the 2nd century. It lost its residual value under Constantine and ceased to be paid regularly in mid-4th century.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the North Korean invasion, the closest American ground force was the 24th Infantry Division, which was based in Japan. This {{division}} had fewer than its normal contingent of soldiers, and most of its <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> rather old due to the U.S. Congress's reductions in military spending. In any case, the 24th Infantry Division was {{the only part of the}} U.S. Army that was available to quickly reinforce South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Auxiliary uniform, armour, {{weapons and}} {{equipment}} were probably standardised {{by the end}} of the Julio-Claudian period. Auxiliary <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> broadly similar to that of the legions (see Section 2.1 below for possible differences in armour). By 68AD, there was little difference between most auxiliary infantry and their legionary counterparts in equipment, training and fighting capability. The main difference was that auxilia contained combat cavalry, both heavy and light, and other specialized units that legions lacked.|$|E

5000|$|U-Haul has {{two main}} classifications for {{equipment}} in its fleet. The first type of <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> known as [...] "In-Town" [...] or [...] "One-Way".

5000|$|Anti-theft {{measures}} taken for registered motor vehicles {{are often not}} used on construction equipment: open cabs of construction <b>equipment</b> can <b>be</b> easy for thieves to access; equipment often has [...] "one key fits all" [...] ignition systems; construction equipment often does not have standardized vehicle identification numbers or serial numbers, and when they do, thieves often remove the numbers; title and registration for the <b>equipment</b> <b>are</b> not mandated. Recordkeeping for construction <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> often poor, making identification of recovered items difficult. Large construction <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> used to flatten a security fence before thieves leave a storage or construction site.|$|R
