5000|$|<b>False</b> <b>Seam</b> - A [...] "false seam" [...] is a seam or {{portion of}} the seam which is {{completely}} unhooked, and in which the folded cover hook is compressed against the folded body hook. A <b>false</b> <b>seam</b> is not always detectable in an external examination.|$|E

5000|$|Traditional teardown. Although pretty rare, in {{this case}} the {{external}} measurements are made (usually consisting of seam length, seam thickness and countersink). Internal parameters are evaluated by tearing down the seam, then measuring the cover hook and body hook parameters mechanically. Then, various calculations are made to evaluate overlap. This procedure is generally considered bad form as it does not evaluate all the seam parameters on the same exact point, which can lead to missing serious defects (including <b>false</b> <b>seams).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The FDA {{regulations}} specifies {{the frequency}} and requirements of non-destructive testing: [...] "21 CFR Part 113.60(a) requires a visual examination of at least 1 can per seaming head by a qualified container closure inspector at intervals of sufficient frequency. The regulation requires that double seamed containers be visually inspected for gross closure defects such as sharp <b>seams,</b> cut-overs, deadheads, <b>false</b> <b>seams,</b> droops and broken chuck. The frequency of the visual examination should be made at intervals not to exceed 30 minutes (of operational time); and additional visual examinations must be performed immediately following a jam in a closing machine, after closing machine adjustment, or after startup of a machine following a prolonged shut-down. An example of a prolonged shut down may be when the plant ceases production at 6:00 PM and restarts production at 8:00 AM the next day." ...|$|R
