60|$|I have lately been (November 25) in the Central-park hospital, near One Hundred and Fourth street; {{it seems}} to be a well-managed institution. During September, and previously, went many times to the Brooklyn city hospital, in Raymond street, where I found (taken in by contract) a number of wounded and sick from the army. Most of the men were badly off, and without a cent of money, many wanting tobacco. I {{supplied}} them, and a few special cases with delicacies; also repeatedly with letter-paper, stamps, envelopes, etc., writing the addresses myself plainly--(a pleased crowd <b>gathering</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> as I directed for each one in turn.) This Brooklyn hospital is a bad place for soldiers, or anybody else. Cleanliness, proper nursing, watching, etc., are more deficient than in any hospital I know. For dinner on Sundays I invariably found nothing but rice and molasses. The men all speak well of Drs. Yale and Kissam for kindness, patience, etc., and I think, from what I saw, there are also young medical men. In its management otherwise, this is the poorest hospital I have been in, out of many hundreds.|$|E
5000|$|On April 28, 2016, Little Richard's friend, Bootsy Collins stated on his Facebook page that, [...] "he {{is not in}} {{the best}} of health so I ask all the Funkateers to lift him up." [...] Reports {{subsequently}} began being published on the internet stating that Little Richard was in grave health and that his family were gathering at his bedside. On May 3, 2016, Rolling Stone reported that Little Richard and his lawyer provided a health information update in which Richard stated, [...] "not only is my family not <b>gathering</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> because I'm ill, but I'm still singing. I don't perform like I used to, but I have my singing voice, I walk around, I had hip surgery a while ago but I'm healthy.'" [...] His lawyer also reported: [...] "He's 83. I don't know how many 83-year-olds still get up and rock it out every week, but in light of the rumors, I wanted to tell you that he's vivacious and conversant about a ton of different things and he's still very active in a daily routine. I used to represent Prince and he just engaged me in all kinds of Prince conversations, calling him a 'creative genius.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If I find from {{experience}} that natives of Melanesia, taken to a different island, however fertile, dry, and apparently healthy, {{do seem to be}} affected by it, I must modify my plans, try as soon as possible to have more winter schools, and, what is of more consequence, I must reconsider the whole question of native teachers. If a great amount of sickness is {{to be the result of}} <b>gathering</b> scholars <b>around</b> <b>me</b> at an island, I could do, perhaps, more single- handed, in health, and with no one to look after, than with twenty fellows of whom half are causing continual anxiety on the score of health. Now were I alone, I should be as brisk as a bee, but I feel weighed down somewhat with the anxiety about all these fellows about me.|$|R
60|$|I {{spent the}} whole of the day begging in the streets and dodging the guard, and even so I only {{collected}} four sous. I could have got more perhaps, only that at about midday the smell of food from an eating-house turned me sick and faint, and when I regained consciousness I found myself huddled up under a doorway and evening <b>gathering</b> in fast <b>around</b> <b>me.</b> If Mme. la Marquise could go two days without food I ought to go four. I struggled to my feet; fortunately I had retained possession of my four sous, else of a truth I would not have had the courage {{to go back to the}} miserable attic which was the only home I knew.|$|R
