50|$|Wood Waste RecyclingThe {{wood waste}} {{operation}} {{consists of an}} <b>electric</b> <b>grinder</b> and trommel screen, {{and a series of}} electrically powered feed, transfer, and stacking conveyors. The operation processes clean wood loads hauled by customers, which are separated from mixed debris by staff or removed from the demolition debris processing operation. The wood waste is ultimately ground and screened to create wood chips and wood fines. Wood waste is used as biomass to power cogeneration facilities or marketed as mulch or soil amendments.|$|E

50|$|The {{day before}} baking pīrāgi, the cook usually spends {{one or two}} hours {{preparing}} any meat and onion that will be used. Bacon and other fatty meats (such as bacon or back bacon) do not chop well {{in a food processor}} and tend to get caught on the blade, so the cook must hand chop these into tiny cubes, about 1.5 millimetres (about 1/16 inches). This is sometimes made easier by freezing the meat for a few minutes. Other less fatty meats (such as beef) tend to turn into a paste in the food processor, so if the meat is not already ground, the cook grinds it using a hand or <b>electric</b> <b>grinder.</b>|$|E
50|$|Angle {{grinders}} {{are widely}} used in metalworking and construction, {{as well as in}} emergency rescues. They are commonly found in workshops, service garages and auto body repair shops. There is a large variety of angle grinders to choose from when trying to find the right one for the job. The most important factors in choosing the right grinder are the disc size and how powerful the motor is. Other factors include power source (pneumatic or electric), rpm, and arbor size. Generally disc size and power increase together. Disc size is usually measured in inches or millimetres. Common disc sizes for angle grinders in the U.S.A. include 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 12 inches. Discs for pneumatic grinders also come much smaller. Pneumatic grinders are generally used for lighter duty jobs where more precision is required. This is likely because pneumatic grinders can be small and light yet remain powerful, because they do not contain heavy copper motor windings, while it is harder for an <b>electric</b> <b>grinder</b> to maintain adequate power with smaller size. Electric grinders are more commonly used for larger, heavy duty jobs. However, there are also small electric grinders and large pneumatic grinders.|$|E

CMM was used to measure the <b>electric</b> <b>grinder</b> based on its three-dimensional model which has complex surface shape. It’s required to know the errors between the actual components and the three-dimensional model, if the traditional methods is used，the measurement will not be precise, these problems will be solved well based on coordinate measuring machine when combined with the three-dimensional modeling software. Experiment results showed that the accuracy of the detection Part meet requirements of the drawings and using the CMM to measure the complex surface can be completed well {{under the control of the}} computer. It not only shortened the time, lowed labor intensity, operated easily but also greatly enhanced the accuracy and had better practicality...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates an {{effective}} and economical way for laboratory scale production of micro fine sized palm oil fuel ash (POFA) using an <b>electric</b> powder <b>grinder.</b> The raw POFA obtained from the palm oil mill is initially grinded by using Los Angeles abrasion machine, and then sieved using 150 μm sieve before it is burned in a furnace at 500 °C. The burned POFA is then grinded using <b>electric</b> powder <b>grinder</b> to obtain the targeted micro fine sized. The physical, morphological and chemical properties of the micro fine sized POFA produced are analysed {{in the form of}} cement paste using Particle Size Analyzer (PSA), nitrogen sorption by using BET method, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The results show that 96 % micro fine sized POFA is produced when using the optimum grinding process. The microstructural analyses of cement paste with 20 % micro fine sized POFA replacement give the optimum results that contribute to higher compressive strength. The overall results of this research show that the optimum grinding process by using <b>electric</b> powder <b>grinder</b> is relevant and can be used as pioneering work in the concrete production industry...|$|R
