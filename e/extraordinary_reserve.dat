60|$|No delay {{occurred}} after this hint was given. The request of my uncle Ro that the chiefs {{would follow the}} Upright Onondago was {{just in time to}} prevent a flight; in the sense of Manytongues, I mean, for it was not very likely these warriors would literally run away. It is probable that they would have preferred the cover of the woods as more natural and familiar to them--but I remarked, as the whole party came on the piazza, that Flintyheart, in particular, cast a quick, scrutinizing glance at the house, which said in pretty plain language that he was examining its capabilities as a work of defence. The movement, however, was made with perfect steadiness; and, what most surprised us all, was the fact that not one of the chiefs appeared to pay the slightest attention to their advancing foes; or men whom it was reasonable for them to suppose so considered themselves to be. We imputed this <b>extraordinary</b> <b>reserve</b> to force of character, and a desire to maintain a calm and dignified deportment in the presence of Susquesus. If it were really the latter motive that so completely restrained every exhibition of impatience, apprehension, or disquietude, they had every reason to congratulate themselves on the entire success of their characteristic restraint on their feelings.|$|E
50|$|Australia is {{a federal}} {{parliamentary}} constitutional monarchy with Elizabeth II at its apex as the Queen of Australia, a role that is distinct from her position as monarch of the other Commonwealth realms. The Queen is represented in Australia by the Governor-General {{at the federal level}} and by the Governors at the state level, who by convention act on the advice of her ministers. Thus, in practice the Governor-General has no actual decision-making or de facto governmental role, and merely acts as a legal figurehead for the actions of the Prime Minister and the Federal Executive Council. The Governor-General does have <b>extraordinary</b> <b>reserve</b> powers which may be exercised outside the Prime Minister's request in rare and limited circumstances, the most notable exercise of which was the dismissal of the Whitlam Government in the constitutional crisis of 1975.|$|E

40|$|As the {{financial}} crisis has receded, the Federal Reserve has scaled back its extraordinary provision of liquidity. Eventually, the Fed will remove all remaining monetary stimulus by raising the federal funds rate and shrinking its balance sheet. The timing of such renormalizations depends crucially on evolving economic conditions. To many observers, the Federal <b>Reserve’s</b> <b>extraordinary</b> policy actions during the recent crisis averted a financial Armageddon and curtailed the depth and duration of the recession (Rudebusch 2009). To combat panic and dislocation in financial markets, the Fed provided {{an enormous amount of}} liquidity. To mitigate declines in spending and employment, it reduced the federal funds interest rate—its usual policy instrument—essentially to its lower bound of zero. To provide additional monetary stimulus, the Fed turned to an unconventional policy tool—purchases of longer-term securities—which led to an enormous expansion of its balance sheet. As financial market strains eased and economic recovery began, discussion turned to how the Fed would unwind its actions (Bernanke 2010). Of course, after every recession, the Fed has to decide how quickly to return monetary conditions to normal to forestall inflationary pressures. This time, however, policy renormalization is especially challenging because of the unprecedented economic conditions and Fe...|$|R

This includes the currently running virtual laboratories of the EU project POW'WOW {{as well as the}} research methodology of the soon-to-start EU projects ANEMOS. PLUS and SafeWind, which aim to develop advanced tools for the management of electricity grids with large-scale wind generation and to get a better handle on extreme events. Focus in ANEMOS. PLUS is given to functions such as optimal scheduling, reserves estimation, bottleneck management, storage management and also optimal trading in electricity markets. For all of them, short-term forecasting as well as uncertainty estimation plays a major role. However, this information is not yet fully integrated in daily practices. The aim is thus to propose advanced tools for the above functions that integrate the full information on the expected wind generation. In order to demonstrate the value of these tools for end-users, demonstration projects in eight European countries including Denmark are defined. SafeWind on the other hand is a project more focussed on research, especially research in extreme events. Those can be extreme winds, but also extreme forecast errors, requiring an <b>extraordinary</b> amount of <b>reserve</b> capacity. In order to help forecasters to estimate their models against the state-of-the-art models, a Virtual Laboratory for short-term prediction has been instantiated under the POW'WOW project...|$|R

It alone can enlarge the universe, {{causing it to}} relinquish some of its opacity, letting us discover its <b>extraordinary</b> capacities for <b>reserve,</b> proportionate to the innumerable needs of the spirit. Daily life abounds in exactly this sort of small discovery … You only {{have to know how}} to get along in the labyrinth. (Breton 1987 : 15 - 16) " Historicity, specifically the construction of images and their subsequent remembering, has a special relevance for the endeavours of Dada and surrealism, two movements which sought to reconstruct the everyday through a disassembly of images and their values. The architecture of the city was an important part of this process. It was celebrated by the surrealists for its residual qualities that not only evoked historical time but spatial and lived experience more generally. While studies of architecture and surrealism have focussed, to a large extent, on the “objects” that they selected to substitute for buildings, there is an equally rich counter-current within surrealism that used memory and the found object as a strategy to dismantle the homogenising forces of modernist architecture. Within this is a re-discovery of the historical trace and its power as a polemical tool in the construction of images and their dissemination. This paper investigates the role of the objet trouvé within the activities of the avant-garde, with an emphasis on the theoretical discourse that was attached to surrealism in the 1970 s. The objet trouvé —literally “found object”—became a fascination for both Dada and surrealism in the 1920 s. Both movements used the discovery of objects (and the associated psychological displacement) to challenge bourgeois conventions of the art object and contemporary expectations of lived experience. In the 1970 s there was, for the first time, a dedicated discourse on avant-garde practice which set out to diagnose the specific practices of the historical avant-garde and the philosophical motivations underpinning them. If modernism was characterised by the autonomy of the artistic object in this discourse, avant-garde practices in this period were defined by the conflation of art and life in artistic production and the rejection of aesthetic categories more generally. In this sense, the avant-garde can be seen as a distinct trajectory from modernism: a fact that has been made explicit in the theoretical positions of both Hilde Heynen (1999) and Andreas Huyssen (1986), amongst others...|$|R
