5000|$|Later, toy maker Cragstan {{wanted a}} piece of the diecast market that Corgi and Dinky had {{captured}} and enlisted Gamda Koor models for its international (and specifically American) sales. These models also used the garage <b>door</b> <b>box,</b> but often with a patriotic red, white and blue color scheme on the backing card and {{down the side of the}} box. Cragstan called its Sabra Super Cars, [...] "Detroit Seniors". The Cragstan and Detroit Senior names were also molded into the plastic chrome bases of these cars. There were few differences between Sabra and Cragstan castings. One could be seen on the Chevelle wagon. The Chevrolet bow tie was shown on the sides behind the front wheel well, but on the Cragstan version it is missing. The Cragstan cars went for $1.49 in the US market, but did not bear the standard Israeli police, army and post symbols (Bickford 2013).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Automatic {{obstacle}} detection and avoidance {{is a key}} component {{for the success of}} micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) in the future. As the payload of MAVs is highly constrained, cameras are attractive sensors because they are both lightweight and provide rich information about the environment. In this paper, we present an approach that allows a quadrotor with a single monocular camera to locally generate collision-free waypoints. We acquire a small set of images while the quadrotor is hovering from which we compute a dense depth map. Based on this depth map, we render a 2 D scan and generate a suitable waypoint for nav-igation. In our experiments, we found that the pose variation during hovering is already sufficient to obtain suitable depth maps. The computation takes less than one second which renders our approach applicable for obstacle avoidance in real-time. We demonstrate the validity of our approach in challenging environments where we navigate a Parrot Ardrone quadrotor successfully through narrow pas-sages including <b>doors,</b> <b>boxes,</b> and people...|$|R

In a 2012 interview with Mojo magazine, Davies said, [...] "The funniest thing was when my publisher came to me on tour and said The Doors had used the riff for 'All Day And All Of The Night' for 'Hello, I Love You.' I said rather than sue them, can't we just get them to own up? My publisher said, 'They have, that's why we should sue them!'" [...] And in a 2014 interview with Rolling Stone, Davies suggested that an out-of-court settlement had been reached with the Doors.|$|R
