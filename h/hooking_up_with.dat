25|$|Polly Vernon of British {{newspaper}} The Guardian {{summed up}} her {{analysis of what}} makes a celebrity supercouple in her May 25, 2000 article:The basic appeal of the accomplished supercouple {{can be reduced to}} this: by <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> another, carefully selected celeb, you can eliminate your bad points, compensate for your own shortcomings, and hint at a softer, more vulnerable side. Attach yourself to someone smarter, prettier, more fashionable, hipper, funnier than you are, and you will automatically acquire these missing qualities by osmosis. They, equally, will benefit from your particular brand of star quality. Your public perception will become more complete, more exciting. Together, you are quite literally, the ultimate individual.|$|E
