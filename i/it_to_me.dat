5|$|In {{addition}} to Abbott, the duo recruited other professionals experienced in musical comedy. Choreographer Robert Alton {{had worked in}} such hits as Panama Hattie and in movie musicals. Don Walker was hired to do the orchestrations; his would be simpler than those of Robert Russell Bennett, who usually performed that function in the pair's musicals but who was not available. Irene Sharaff was engaged to design the more than 300costumes which would be needed. The show was originally named Hercules and Juliet, but they soon changed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> and Juliet. The Majestic Theatre, which Rodgers and Hammerstein desired to have for Me and Juliet, was currently occupied by their South Pacific, four years into its run. Arrangements were made to shift South Pacific to the Broadway Theatre though, due to schedule conflicts, this meant moving that show to Boston for five weeks.|$|E
5|$|The {{sixth and}} final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, {{was written in}} 1924–25. After {{suffering}} a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; {{in an article in}} Politiken on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of my head and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end... What use is <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.|$|E
25|$|You may be {{too young}} to remember, but in 1971, during a Test match, I {{collided}} with England fast bowler John Snow and lost my bat. Snow {{picked it up and}} handed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But at the time, many papers wrote that Snow had flung the bat at me. It all depends on your point of view, or what you are trying to portray...|$|E
60|$|I think <b>it</b> {{occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I {{had already}} begun it, in my poor way: but <b>it</b> occurs <b>to</b> <b>me</b> now, whether or no.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that George harped {{too much}} on the getting-upset idea. <b>It</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the wrong spirit to go about the trip in.|$|R
60|$|At least, so <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{the first}} day that I went, awe struck, into the High Woods; and so <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> the last day that I came, even more awe-struck, out of them.|$|R
25|$|My uncle Claude was my {{favorite}} uncle, he was also my godfather. He and I were really, really close. He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E
25|$|These {{principles}} of reason, cause and substance, given thus psychologically, {{enable us to}} pass {{beyond the limits of}} the relative and subjective to objective and absolute reality, they enable us, in a word, to pass from psychology, or the science of knowledge, to ontology or the science of being. These laws are inextricably mixed in consciousness with the data of volition and sensation, with free activity and fatal action or impression, and they guide us in rising to a personal being, a self or free cause, and to an impersonal reality, a not-me—nature, the world of force—lying out of us, and modifying us. As I refer to myself the act of attention and volition, so I cannot but refer the sensation to some cause, necessarily other than myself, that is, to an external cause, whose existence is as certain for me as my own existence, since the phenomenon which suggests <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> is as certain as the phenomenon which had suggested my reality, and both are given in each other. I thus reach an objective impersonal world of forces which corresponds to the variety of my sensations. The relation of these forces or causes to each other is the order of the universe.|$|E
500|$|The backing track, {{especially}} the bassline, has certain similarities to the 1981 number-one R hit [...] "Give <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> Baby" [...] by Rick James. The bass part {{was made from}} two modified Minimoogs playing in unison.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{he likes}} to please," [...] the girl explained--"personally. He would {{appreciate}} you and be clever with you. <b>It's</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> he objects--that is as to my liking you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It must {{sound very}} strange to you, I know," [...] he went on; [...] "and <b>it's</b> strange <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> too; but <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that there isn't {{anything}} I've done without my thinking whether {{you would like}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do it." ...|$|R
60|$|I may be mistaken, but <b>it</b> {{does seem}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that Deerslayer {{is not a}} work of art in any sense; <b>it</b> does seem <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>it</b> is {{destitute}} of every detail that goes to the making of {{a work of art}}; in truth, <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that Deerslayer is just simply a literary delirium tremens.|$|R
500|$|In {{a letter}} dated February 1, 2013 and {{published}} by her father on the Echo of Moscow web site, Tolokonnikova distanced herself from Samutsevich, saying [...] "Samutsevich hasn't written to me for two months. That's <b>it,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> she is already dead. There {{will be no more}} talk of collaborating after this." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the same}} interview, {{he was asked}} if his perfect idea of {{encounter}} was the same as described in the track, one in which your partner is screaming to you, [...] "Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> baby, give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> motherfucker" [...] and having attracted the attention of the cops due to the violent noises you are making with your partner outside while [...] "trying to get in". To this question Mars said [...] "It definitely sounds awesome. Right? Isn't that what matters? It's an awesome song! I don't know how to tell you that more". In another interview, this time for Rolling Stone, he explained that the track is about [...] "good old animalistic sex". When the interviewer asked if Mars was concerned with the verses [...] "Got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker" [...] due to his 2010 drug bust, he replied [...] "To take that line out would dilute my art", since the recording [...] "needs a sense of danger. When I was a kid, pop could be dangerous but still massive. Michael Jackson would grab his crotch. Prince would rock assless chaps".|$|E
500|$|... "The {{song was}} so amazing I {{had to be}} sure, as an artist, that she really was trying to give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I was like 'is she really trying to give me this song, because it's pretty amazing.' They were like 'yes, but she wants to stay on it with you.' And I was like, 'Wow! Beyoncé? Thanks!' And you know I love and respect her to death so I wouldn't pass that chance up." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It is {{the most}} terrible thing in likenesses I have ever seen," [...] the woman {{continued}} slowly. [...] "When you entered the room a few seconds ago, <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that a miracle had happened. <b>It</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the dead had come to life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't expect <b>it</b> <b>to</b> do <b>me</b> any good. I don't want <b>it</b> <b>to</b> do <b>me</b> {{more good}} {{than it does}} now," [...] said my convict, with a greedy laugh. [...] "I took him. He knows it. That's enough for me." ...|$|R
500|$|Insistent on the unimportance of {{specifications}} in general, Naim never published {{technical specifications}} for this low-powered design. Trade speculation {{of its power}} output ranged from 5 to 15 watts per channel. Naim confirmed years later that the NAIT is rated at 13 watts. Part of its mystique seemed to stem from its low power: in developing the successor to the NAIT, Naim founder Julian Vereker remarked that R [...] "cooked up a more powerful version and presented <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> on my return [...] it sounded awful." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I didn't think I {{was going}} to win, but I decided {{if they were going}} to give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I {{was going to}} yell... Writers told me, 'Boy, you really gave it to the producers.' Producers told me, 'Boy, you really stuck it to the {{networks}}.' The networks told me, 'Boy, you really hammered the studios.' Nobody got to the point. I was indicting all of us. What is frustrating about this is nothing has changed. Everybody wants to do everything the way it has been done 100 times before." ...|$|E
500|$|During the film's {{pre-production}} at Paramount, Boorman cast Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton in {{the lead}} roles of Hank and Jacob Mitchell, respectively. A Simple Plan marked the second on-screen collaboration between Paxton and Thornton after One False Move (1992). Thornton recalled, [...] "I {{got a call from}} one of my agents who said, 'John Boorman wants you to do a script that I sent you a year ago and you never read,' I said, 'Send <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> again, and this time I'll really read it.' Within the first two pages, I knew I wanted to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|This moment yearning and thoughtful, sitting alone, <b>It</b> seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{there are}} other men in other lands, yearning and thoughtful; <b>It</b> seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I can look over and behold them in Prussia, Italy, France, [...] Spain--or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or India--talking [...] other dialects; And <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> if I could know those men, I should become {{attached}} to [...] them, as I do to men in my own lands. O I know we should be brethren and lovers; I know I should be happy with them.|$|R
60|$|At {{the mention}} of Samuel I could have sworn to a strange light in her eyes, and <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> as by some telepathic flash, that I divined in her a {{tremendous}} wistfulness, an immense yearning. <b>It</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that here {{was the key to}} her inscrutableness, the clue that if followed properly would make all her strangeness plain. <b>It</b> came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that here was a contact and that for the moment I was glimpsing into the soul of her. The question was tickling on my tongue, but she forestalled me.|$|R
5000|$|During oral {{arguments}} before the three-judge appeals panel, Judge E. Grady Jolly remarked that [...] "For some reason, this one {{got out of}} hand <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> ... <b>It</b> does seem <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like the government overreacted here." ...|$|R
500|$|Schembechler later {{recalled}} that he remained loyal to Elliott {{when he took}} over as Michigan's head coach in 1969. [...] When Schembechler won the Big Ten championship in 1969, he said, [...] "I made certain I let everyone know I won with Bump's kids. [...] Bump was a man of great class and he showed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> again and again in that first year, never getting in the way, always trying to be helpful, always trying to encourage me." [...] After Michigan won the 1969 Ohio State game, the team presented the game ball to Elliott, and Schembechler noted that [...] "I don’t remember when I felt happier about anything in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{month later}} {{in a letter to}} Pound, he {{mentioned}} that [...] "You, naturally, would say, [...] "Good" [...] etc. But don't say <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I ain't reached that mood." [...] In his reply, Pound pointed out that Hemingway had only lost [...] "the time it will... take you to rewrite the parts you can remember... If the middle, i.e., FORM, of the story is right then one {{ought to be able to}} reassemble it from memory... If the thing wobbles and won't reform... then it never wd. have been right." [...] Critics are uncertain whether he took Pound's advice and re-created existing stories or whether everything he wrote after the loss of the suitcase was new.|$|E
500|$|John Hurt plays Harold [...] "Ox" [...] Oxley, Mutt's {{surrogate}} {{father and}} Indiana's old friend. Frank Darabont had suggested Hurt while writing the screenplay. The character {{is inspired by}} Ben Gunn of Treasure Island. Hurt read the script before agreeing to his role, unlike other cast members who came on [...] "because Steven— you know, 'God'— was doing it. And I said, 'Well, I {{need to have a}} little bit of previous knowledge even if God is doing it.' So they sent a courier over with the script from Los Angeles, gave <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at three o'clock in the afternoon in London, collected it again at eight o'clock in the evening, and he returned the next day to Los Angeles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A balloon?" [...] said Bernard. [...] "Nay, <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that {{till they}} were over, I never thought at all except {{how to get}} the most rollicking and the finest rowing out of life. <b>It</b> seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I had about as much sense as a green monkey." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> never {{occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that he could}} change. I felt so secure in his love. <b>It</b> {{never occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that anyone could take him from me.|$|R
5000|$|On 12 October 2009, he {{recorded}} {{the first episode}} of As <b>It</b> Occurs <b>To</b> <b>Me,</b> a weekly radio-style stand-up and sketch show made for the Internet. It stars himself, Emma Kennedy, Dan Tetsell and Christian Reilly and currently stands at 18 episodes and 5 bonus mini-episodes. It was nominated for best internet show at the 2010 Sony Awards, though <b>it</b> failed <b>to</b> place. On 7 February 2011, As <b>It</b> Occurs <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> won the first Chortle Internet award [...] On 20 March 2012 he retained it. In 2017, As <b>It</b> Occurs <b>To</b> <b>Me</b> returns as a six-episode web series.|$|R
500|$|After {{giving his}} team the news, McKechnie had the Reds {{dedicate}} themselves to winning the World Series [...] "for Hershie". His number was retired {{for the season}} by the team as a tribute. McKechnie never publicly revealed what Willard Hershberger said to him during their meeting the day before: [...] "It {{had nothing to do}} with anybody on the team", he told reporters. [...] "He told <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in confidence, and I will not utter it to anyone". The Cincinnati Reds would go on to defeat the American League champion Detroit Tigers in seven games to win the 1940 World Series. Reds players decided to share a portion of their championship money, totaling $5,803, with Hershberger's mother, Maude. Hershberger was buried at Visalia Public Cemetery in Visalia, California.|$|E
500|$|Drake's {{shirt is}} always tucked {{into his pants}} on only one side, an {{attribute}} which commentators have labeled the [...] "half-tuck". The term, first coined by video game designer Tim Schafer, led to Naughty Dog altering Drake's appearance to have his shirt almost tucked in from the front, and half tucked in at the back, an inside joke Naughty Dog co-president Evan Wells labeled a [...] "three-quarters-tuck." [...] The half-tuck {{was part of a}} larger effort to ensure Drake's design was asymmetrical. Tim Schafer commented [...] "It was all super next-gen, but the most next-gen thing about <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> was Drake's shirt. Check it out: Somehow it's tucked in, and yet not tucked in, at the very same time. Of all the technical marvels contained in Uncharted, this was the one that really mystified me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} Stieg Larsson's novel created Hollywood {{interest}} in adapting the book, as became apparent in 2009, when Lynton and Pascal pursued {{the idea of}} developing an [...] "American" [...] version unrelated to the Swedish film adaptation released that year. By December, two major developments occurred for the project: Steven Zaillian, who had recently completed the script for Moneyball (2011), became the screenwriter, while producer Scott Rudin finalized a partnership allocating full copyrights to Sony. Zaillian, who was unfamiliar with the novel, got a copy from Rudin. The screenwriter recalled, [...] "They sent <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'We want to do this. [...] We will {{think of it as}} one thing for now. It's possible that it can be two and three, but let's concentrate on this one.'" [...] After reading the book, the screenwriter did no research on the subject.|$|E
6000|$|Then he went on. [...] "I have {{no peace}} or rest for <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> calls <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> for many minutes together, in an agonised manner, 'Below there! Look out! Look out!' <b>It</b> stands waving <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> rings my little bell--" ...|$|R
6000|$|This moment yearning and {{thoughtful}} sitting alone, [...] <b>It</b> seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{there are other}} men in other lands yearning {{and thoughtful}}, [...] <b>It</b> seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I can look over and behold them in Germany, Italy, [...] France, Spain, [...] Or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or talking other dialects, [...] And <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> if I could know those men I should become [...] attached to them as I do to men in my own lands, [...] O I know we should be brethren and lovers, [...] I know I should be happy with them.|$|R
