30|$|In {{contrast}} to the first quarter, for aptitude tests starting {{in the second and}} third quarter we observe, that treatment effects are larger for immigrants than <b>for</b> <b>natives.</b> During the whole observation period, the estimated effect for immigrants amounts to more than 10 percentage points, whereas the corresponding estimate <b>for</b> <b>natives</b> ranges between 6.4 and 9.7 percentage points. In the fourth quarter, the picture is again reversed. We now find large treatment effects with a magnitude of more than 15 percentage points <b>for</b> <b>natives,</b> while the effect for immigrants amounts to about 10 percentage points.|$|R

We evaluate the effects of participation in this program on the employment chances of immigrant welfare recipients and contrast the findings with program effects <b>for</b> <b>natives.</b> Our results reveal that Temporary Extra Jobs fail to achieve their objective. The estimated effects are more adverse <b>for</b> <b>natives,</b> but the program is ineffective for participating immigrants either. Therefore, the program is a dead‐end road rather than a merging lane to regular employment both <b>for</b> <b>natives</b> and <b>for</b> immigrants. ...|$|R

5|$|The Columbia and {{its tributaries}} have been central to the region's culture and economy for {{thousands}} of years. They {{have been used for}} transportation since ancient times, linking the region's many cultural groups. The river system hosts many species of anadromous fish, which migrate between freshwater habitats and the saline waters of the Pacific Ocean. These fish—especially the salmon species—provided the core subsistence <b>for</b> <b>native</b> peoples.|$|E

30|$|Even {{if it is}} {{difficult}} to compare estimates across groups we can say something about the state dependence among natives as compared to immigrants. First, we note that the standard errors of the estimates are small which makes the 95 percent confidence interval rather narrow. As a result, the confidence intervals of the same estimate for the two groups are not overlapping making the estimates of the lagged dependent variable <b>for</b> <b>natives</b> and immigrants being significantly different from each other. It might thus seem reasonable to conclude that state dependence is a more severe problem among non-Western immigrants than among natives but that it is exists and is fairly large also <b>for</b> <b>natives.</b> The estimates <b>for</b> Western immigrants are between those <b>for</b> <b>natives</b> and non-Western immigrants.|$|R

5|$|A land {{of green}} fields for crop {{cultivation}} and cattle rearing limits the space {{available for the}} establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge <b>for</b> <b>native</b> wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the Rechtschool in 1920, Soeprapto went {{directly}} to working at the Landraad (court <b>for</b> <b>Native</b> Indonesians) in his hometown. For fifteen years he worked at Landraad in various locations, including in Surabaya, Semarang, Bandung, and Denpasar. He eventually rose to Head of the Landraad in Cirebon and Kuningan, serving from 1937 to 1941. From there, he transferred to the Landraad for Salatiga and Boyolali, then to Besuki, before settling {{as head of the}} landraad in Pekalongan. While in Pekalongan, Soeprapto befriended a local prosecutor Soekarjo Kario Hatmodjo, father of Hoegeng.|$|E

His mother died during his second year at the school, and Oerip left to undertake military training in Meester Cornelis, Batavia (modern-day Jatinegara, Jakarta). Upon graduating in 1914, he became a lieutenant in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army; during almost 25 years of service he was stationed on three different islands and promoted several times, eventually becoming the highest-ranking Native officer in the country.|$|E

30|$|While the {{mobility}} towards higher occupational tiers {{is certainly a}} positive outcome <b>for</b> <b>natives,</b> it may imply, in the short and medium run, higher risks of searching for a new job. A {{modified version of the}} “crowding-out” hypothesis (that argues that immigrants decrease the job opportunities <b>for</b> <b>natives)</b> would imply that immigrants push natives to move to other occupations, increasing their transitional periods in non-employment. While immigrants may create complementary opportunities <b>for</b> <b>natives,</b> beneficial in the long-run, the fact that natives have to change occupation to take advantage of those opportunities may leave them unemployed, or out of the labor force for a while. Moreover, while on average workers upgrade their jobs, some workers may be left without one for long time, because immigrants crowd their opportunities in lower occupational tiers or because other natives compete with them, pushed from lower tiers.|$|R

5|$|<b>For</b> <b>Native</b> Americans, Pontiac's War {{demonstrated}} {{the possibilities of}} pan-tribal cooperation in resisting Anglo-American colonial expansion. Although the conflict divided tribes and villages, the war also saw the first extensive multi-tribal resistance to European colonization in North America, {{and was the first}} war between Europeans and Native North Americans that did not end in complete defeat for the Native Americans. The Proclamation of 1763 ultimately did not prevent British colonists and land speculators from expanding westward, and so Native Americans found it necessary to form new resistance movements. Beginning with conferences hosted by Shawnees in 1767, in the following decades leaders such as Joseph Brant, Alexander McGillivray, Blue Jacket, and Tecumseh would attempt to forge confederacies that would revive the resistance efforts of Pontiac's War.|$|E
5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, salmon was a reliable food source <b>for</b> <b>Native</b> Americans living along the Rogue. Salmon migrations were so huge that early settlers claimed {{they could hear}} the fish moving upstream. These large runs continued into the 20thcentury despite damage to spawning beds caused by gold mining in the 1850s and large-scale commercial fishing that began shortly thereafter. The fishing industry fed demands for salmon in the growing cities of Portland and San Francisco and for canned salmon in England.|$|E
