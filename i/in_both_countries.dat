5|$|Narayan {{performed}} in Afghanistan in 1952 and in China in 1954 and was well received <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>countries.</b> His first solo concert at a 1954 music festival in the Cowasji Jehangir Hall, Mumbai, {{was cut short}} when an impatient audience, waiting for performances by famous artists, drove him from the stage.

He later regained confidence, performed solo for smaller crowds, and was favourably received in his second attempt to play solo for a Mumbai music festival in 1956. He has since performed at the major music festivals of India. Narayan later gave up accompaniment; this decision carried a financial risk because interest in solo sarangi was not yet substantial.|$|E
