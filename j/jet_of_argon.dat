The resistivity of bare ZnO films on glass decreased from 108 to 104 – 105 Ω[*]cm at maximum surface temperatures Tmaxs above 650 °C, whereas the resistivity increased from 10 - 4 to 10 - 3 – 10 - 2 Ω[*]cm for bare AZO films.

40|$|High {{harmonic}} generation (HHG) {{at a high}} repetition rate requires tight focusing of the moderate peak power driving pulses. So far the conversion efficiencies that have been achieved in this regime are orders of magnitude behind the values that have been demonstrated with loose focusing of high energy (high peak power) lasers. In this contribution, we discuss the scaling laws for the main physical quantities of HHG and in particular analyze the limiting effects: dephasing, absorption and plasma defocusing. It turns out that phase-matched and absorption-limited HHG can be achieved even for very small focal spot sizes using a target gas provided with an adequately high density. Experimentally, we investigate HHG in a gas <b>jet</b> <b>of</b> <b>argon,</b> krypton and xenon. By analyzing the pressure dependence {{we are able to}} disentangle the dephasing and absorption effects and prove that the generated high order harmonics are phase-matched and absorption-limited.

Abel inversion was introduced to reconstruct the spatial characteristics. In the central area <b>of</b> the plasma <b>jet,</b> the ionization <b>of</b> <b>argon</b> {{was found to be}} one of the reasons for low emission <b>of</b> atomic <b>argon.</b> Another reason could be the demixing so that helium prevails around the central axis <b>of</b> the plasma <b>jet.</b> The excitation temperature <b>of</b> <b>argon</b> was calculated by the Boltzmann plot method. Its values decreased from the center to the edge <b>of</b> the plasma <b>jet.</b> Applying the same method, a spurious high excitation temperature of helium was obtained, which could be caused by the strong deviation from local thermal equilibrium of helium. The addition of hydrogen into plasma gases leads to a lower excitation temperature, however a higher substrate temperature due to the high thermal conductivity induced by the dissociation of hydrogen. A loading effect is exerted by the feedstock powder on the plasma jet, which was found to reduce the average excitation temperature considerably by more than 700 K in the Ar/He jet...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the study, an RF coupled, {{atmospheric}} pressure, laminar plasma <b>jet</b> <b>of</b> <b>argon</b> was investigated for thermodynamic equilibrium and some rate processes. Improved values of transition probabilities for 17 lines of argon I were developed from known values for 7 lines. The effect of inhomogeneity of the source was pointed out. The temperatures, T, and the electron densities, n e, were determined spectroscopically from the population densities of the higher excited states assuming the Saha-Boltzmann relationship to be valid for these states. The axial velocities, v z, were measured by tracing the paths of particles of boron nitride using a three-dimentional mapping technique. The above quantities varied in the following ranges: 10 12 ˂ n e ˂ 10 15 particles/cm 3, 3500 ˂ T ˂ 11000 °K, and 200 ˂ v z ˂ 1200 cm/sec. The absence of excitation equilibrium for the lower excitation population including the ground state under certain conditions of T and n e was established and the departure from equilibrium was examined quantitatively. The ground state was shown to be highly underpopulated for the decaying plasma. Rates of recombination between electrons and ions were obtained by solving the steady-state equation of continuity for electrons. The observed rates were consistent with a dissociative-molecular ion mechanism with a steady-state assumption for the molecular ions. In the second part of the study, decomposition of NO was studied in the plasma at lower temperatures. The mole fractions of NO denoted by x NO were determined gas-chromatographically and varied between 0. 0012 ˂ x NO ˂ 0. 0055. The temperatures were measured pyrometrically and varied between 1300 ˂ T ˂ 1750 °K. The observed rates of decomposition were orders of magnitude greater than those obtained by the previous workers under purely thermal reaction conditions. The overall activation energy was about 9 kcal/g mol which was considerably lower than the value under thermal conditions. The effect of excess nitrogen was to reduce the rate of decomposition of NO and to increase the order of the reaction with respect to NO from 1. 33 to 1. 85. The observed rates were consistent with a chain mechanism in which atomic nitrogen and oxygen act as chain carriers. The increased rates of decomposition and the reduced activation energy in the presence of the plasma could be explained on the basis of the observed large amount of atomic nitrogen which was probably formed as the result of reactions between excited atoms and ions of argon and the molecular nitrogen. ...|$|E

40|$|OAK A 271 DISRUPTION MITIGATION WITH HIGH-PRESSURE NOBLE GAS INJECTION. High-pressure gas <b>jets</b> <b>of</b> neon and <b>argon</b> {{are used}} to {{mitigate}} the three principal damaging effects of tokamak disruptions: thermal loading of the divertor surfaces, vessel stress from poloidal halo currents and the buildup and loss of relativistic electrons to the wall. The gas jet penetrates as a neutral species through to the central plasma at its sonic velocity. The injected gas atoms increase up to 500 times the total electron inventory in the plasma volume, resulting in a relatively benign radiative dissipation of > 95 % of the plasma stored energy. The rapid cooling and the slow movement of the plasma to the wall reduce poloidal halo currents during the current decay. The thermally collapsed plasma is very cold ({approx} 1 - 2 eV) and the impurity charge distribution can include > 50 % fraction neutral species. If a sufficient quantity of gas is injected, the neutrals inhibit runaway electrons. A physical model of radiative cooling is developed and validated against DIII-D experiments. The model shows that gas jet mitigation, including runaway suppression, extrapolates favorably to burning plasmas where disruption damage will be more severe.
