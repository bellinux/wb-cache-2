These classes were de ned and examined in [4]. Their importance {{stems from the fact that}} the complexity of a number of problems from linear algebra over Z=kZ is given by these classes (in the sense that they are complete in the respective classes); among these problems are singularity of matrices, inversion of matrices, iterated matrix product, etc. Buntrock et al. also examined structural properties of these classes. E. g., it was shown in [4] that for prime q, all the classes MOD q L are closed under Boolean operations, under logspace disjunctive or conjunctive reducibility, under join, and under NC reductions (Lemma 6 in [4]).

40|$|Among my {{many other}} {{activities}} these days, I 2 ̆ 7 <b>m</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> {{a new book}} … or something like that. That qualification reflects {{the uncertainty of the}} times. As volumes printed on paper evolve to newer media – at some point, a printed volume seems likely to become a luxury item – we 2 ̆ 7 re obliged to think about what constitutes a book in the digital age. I used to think I knew the answer, but I 2 ̆ 7 m no longer remotely sure. Two recent events have not cleared things up. After listening to smart and well-informed speakers at a "Future of Publishing" panel in California late last year, as well as at last week 2 ̆ 7 s "O 2 ̆ 7 Reilly Tools of Change for Publishing" conference in New York City, I found myself, if anything, less certain. It was easy, not so long ago, to say, "This is a book, and this isn 2 ̆ 7 t. " From the early Codex to hand-penned Bibles (created by "scribes"), Gutenberg 2 ̆ 7 s printing press through the late 20 th century, a book was a collection of bound pages. But as has happened with other media forms, digital technology has blurred the lines we once took for granted. On the internet, media formats easily cross boundaries – something we 2 ̆ 7 ve all seen in recent times. In the news business, for example, what were once print-only newspapers now create videos, and television channels have added articles that could easily appear in print. Everyone is using new tools, such as map/sensor mashups, to create a vast variety of forms that are native to the online world. We can still identify a newspaper if it 2 ̆ 7 s dropped at our doorstep – and some of us still get the New York Times delivered on Sundays – but take it online and it 2 ̆ 7 s clearly something else. The book 2 ̆ 7 s boundaries have moved as well, but not as far. It still functions as a linear, self-contained unit. It has a beginning, a middle and and end.

In this paper, a prototype direct absorption solar collector having gross area 1. 4 <b>m</b> 2 <b>working</b> <b>on</b> volumetric absorption principle is developed {{to investigate the}} effect of using Al 2 O 3 –H 2 O nanofluid as heat transfer fluid at different flow rates.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for {{the regulation of}} boom sprayers working in circular trajectories has been developed. In this type of trajectory, {{the areas of the}} plots of land treated by the outer nozzles of the boom are treated at reduced rates, and those treated by the inner nozzles are treated in excess. The goal {{of this study was to}} establish the methodology to determine the flow of the individual nozzles on the boom to guarantee that the dose of the product applied per surface unit is similar across the plot. This flow is a function of the position of the equipment (circular trajectory radius) and of the displacement velocity such that the treatment applied per surface unit is uniform. GPS technology was proposed as a basis to establish the position and displacement velocity of the tractor. The viability of this methodology was simulated considering two circular plots with radii of 160 m and 310 m, using three sets of equipment with boom widths of 14. 5, 24. 5 and 29. 5 m. Data showed as increasing boom widths produce bigger errors in the surface dose applied (L/m 2). Error also increases with decreasing plot surface. As an example, considering the three boom widths of 14. 5, 24. 5 and 29. 5 <b>m</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> a circular plot with a radius of 160 m, the percentage of surface with errors in the applied surface dose greater than 5 % was 30 %, 58 % and 65 % respectively. Considering a circular plot with radius of 310 m the same errors were 8 %, 22 % and 31 %. To obtain a uniform superficial dose two sprayer regulation alternatives have been simulated considering a 14. 5 m boom: the regulation of the pressure of each nozzle and the regulation of the pressure of each boom section. The viability of implementing the proposed methodology on commercial boom sprayers using GPS antennas to establish the position and displacement velocity of the tractor was justified with a field trial in which a self-guiding commercial GPS system was used along with three precision GPS systems located in the sprayer boom. The use of an unique central GPS unit should allow the estimation of the work parameters of the boom nozzles (including those located at the boom ends) with great accuracy...|$|R

Voisin successfully flew it on 8 June 1905, having been towed into the air behind a motor boat on the river Seine between the Billancourt and Sèvres bridges, managing a flight of about 600 <b>m.</b> While <b>working</b> <b>on</b> this aircraft Voisin had been approached by Louis Blériot, who asked him to build him a similar machine, later known as the Bleriot II. This differed principally in having a smaller span lower wing, resulting in the outer 'side-curtains' between upper and lower wings being angled outwards. After this first flight Bleriot suggested to Voisin that they form a partnership to build aircraft, and so Voisin ended his association with Archdeacon's syndicate. Voisin attempted flights in both aircraft on 18 July 1905. Although the weather was unsuitable, with a strong crosswind, Voisin decided to attempt to fly the aircraft since {{it was difficult to}} obtain the necessary permission to use the river. He made a short flight in his own glider and then attempted a flight in Bleriot's. This took off quickly, but Voisin could not control it and it crashed into the river. Voisin was trapped inside and was lucky to escape drowning. Louis Bleriot's cine footage of this experiment survives in the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum.|$|R

The study was conducted in the years 2014 - 2015 on a selected rural water supply line. The analysis was based on values of hourly water demand as measured by a water meter coupled with a recording device. The research showed that both the volume and fluctuations in daily water demand were higher in the spring and the summer, versus the autumn and the winter. This was most probably caused by water consumption for additional purposes, specific for rural areas. Individual water demand was the highest in the summer, and the lowest in the winter. Two peaks for hourly water demand were determined for the analyzed seasons.

The pharmacokinetics of i. v. and <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> NN 1731 was evaluated in eight minipigs, {{and the effects of}} dose and administration route of NN 1731 (i. v. 180 mg kg 21, n 6; <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> 540 mg kg 21, n 4, or 2000 mg kg 21, n 6) vs vehicle (n 16) were studied on a liver laceration injury in pigs. To simulate a pre-hospital setting, the administration of NN 1731 was delayed by 1 min for <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> administration and 7 min for i. v. administration, at which time fluid resuscitation also began. Results. In the minipigs, NN 1731 exposure was similar after i. v. 180 mg kg 21 and <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> 540 mg kg 21, with a bioavailability of 35 %. The injury and blood loss at 7 min was comparable between the four groups of pigs; however, after 60 min, the blood loss was lower in the i. v. treated animals: 1. 3 (0. 3) (i. v.) vs 2. 2 (0. 8) litres (<b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> 540, <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> 2000, and vehicle) (P, 0. 001).

The paper aims to investigate the underlying mechanisms by comparing the differences between <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> and s. c. preadipocytes in glucose utilization, lipid metabolism, {{and the role of}} BMP signaling pathway. Methods: Experiments were performed in porcine primary <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> and s. c. preadipocytes in culture. The mRNA and protein expression patterns were determined respectively by Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. Cytosolic triglycerides were examined by triglyceride assay. Results: The <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> preadipocytes consumed more glucose by expression of GLUT 1 and s. c. preadipocytes mainly utilized exogenic fatty acids for lipid synthesis by expression of LPL and FAT. Meanwhile, the expression of genes related to lipogenesis and lipolysis in s. c. preadipocytes increased more quickly than those in <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> preadipocytes. The expression patterns of the genes involved in BMP-Smad signaling pathway were consistent with those of the genes participated in adipocytes differentiation in both <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> and s. c. preadipocytes. Exogenous BMP 2 significantly increased, whereas Noggin and Compound C, remarkablely decreased the triglycerides content in <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> preadipoytes, without affecting s. c. preadipocytes. BMP 2 shRNA significantly reduced the mRNA levels of the downstream genes of BMP-Smad signaling pathway and PPAR&# 947; in both <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> and s. c. preadipocytes. Conclusion: These findings suggested that the differentiation and lipid accumulation differences between <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> and s. c. preadipocytes might be caused by the different manners of glucose utilization, lipid metabolism and the BMP-Smad signaling pathway.

5000|$|Dr. Fergus <b>I.</b> <b>M.</b> Craik {{was born}} in Edinburgh, Scotland on April 17, 1935. Craik {{is one of the}} leading psychologists behind the idea of memory. After {{attending}} medical school at the age of 18, Craik found that that was not his true passion. He dropped out of medical school and started studying psychology. He became interested in memory because it was his thesis for graduate school at the University of Liverpool in 1960. Craik's work is heavily influenced by Dr. Treisman's work with information processing. After moving to Toronto, he started <b>working</b> <b>on</b> his now famous paper with Dr. Bob Lockhart explaining [...] "Levels of Processing."

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that Helicobacter pylori infects the stomachs of over 50 % of the world's population and if not treated may cause chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric B-cell lymphoma. The {{aim of this study}} was to enhance the mucosal and systemic immune responses against the H. pylori antigens cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and neutrophil-activating protein (NAP), through combinations of mucosal and systemic immunizations in female BALB/c mice. We found that oral or intranasal (i. n.) followed by <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> immunizations induced significantly higher serum titres against NAP and CagA compared to i. n. alone, oral alone, <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> alone, <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> followed by <b>i.</b> n. or <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> followed by oral immunizations. However, only oral followed by <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> immunizations induced anti-NAP antibody-secreting cells in the stomach. Moreover, mucosal immunizations alone or in combination with <b>i.</b> <b>m.,</b> but not <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> immunizations alone, induced mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) responses in faeces. Any single route or combination of immunization routes with NAP and CagA preferentially induced antigen-specific splenic interleukin- 4 -secreting cells and far fewer interferon-γ-secreting cells in the spleen. Moreover, i. n. immunizations alone or in combination with <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> immunizations induced predominantly serum IgG 1 and far less serum IgG 2 a. Importantly, we found that while both i. n. and <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> recall immunizations induced similar levels of serum antibody responses, mucosal IgA responses in faeces were only achieved through i. n. recall immunization. Collectively, our data show that mucosal followed by systemic immunization significantly enhanced local and systemic immune responses and that i. n. recall immunization is required to induce both mucosal and systemic memory type responses...|$|R

Here we report comparison of the <b>i.</b> <b>m.,</b> subcutaneous (s. c.) and intradermal (i. d.) routes of administration. Sixty subjects were randomized to 6 schedules to evaluate the <b>i.</b> <b>m.,</b> s. c. or i. d. route for prime injections. Three schedules included DNA primes (Wks 0, 4, 8) and 3 schedules included rAd 5 prime (Wk 0); all included rAd 5 <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> boost (Wk 24). DNA vaccine dosage was 4 mg <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> or s. c., but 0. 4 mg i. d., while all rAd 5 vaccinations were 1010 PU. All injections were administered by needle and syringe. Overall, 27 / 30 subjects completed 3 DNA primes; 30 / 30 subjects completed rAd 5 primes. Mild local pruritus (itchiness), superficial skin lesions and injection site nodules were associated with i. d. and s. c., but not <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> injections. All routes induced T-cell and antibody immune responses after rAd 5 boosting. Overall, > 95 % had Env antibody and > 80 % had Env T-cell responses. The pattern of local reactogenicity following i. d. and s. c. injections differed from <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> injections but all routes were well-tolerated. There {{was no evidence of}} an immunogenicity advantage following s. c. or i. d. delivery, supporting <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> delivery as the preferred route of administration.
