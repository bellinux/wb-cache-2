5|$|Historically, optical astronomy, {{also called}} visible light astronomy, {{is the oldest}} form of astronomy. Images of {{observations}} were originally <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> In the late 19th century {{and most of the}} 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 Å to 7000 Å (400 nm to 700nm), that same equipment can be used to observe some near-ultraviolet and near-infrared radiation.|$|E
5|$|While Bungie founder Alex Seropian {{handled the}} {{business}} aspect of Bungie and produced the game's box art and promotional material, Jones programmed the game, wrote the story line, {{and contributed to}} the game's manual. Whereas Jones had single-handedly coded Minotaur, the small staff for Pathways was due to lack of money for a large team. To speed implementation, Jones built a level editor for the game that allowed him to add objects, monsters and walls to the levels. The game's levels and mazes span 40million scaled square feet. Jones' friend, Colin Brent, did much of the art and creature design, reducing Jones' workload and, in the programmer's opinion, improving the art. Each monster was <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> in different states such as stationary, moving, attacking, and dying. They were then scanned into the computer and added to the game; if there were problems, they were redrawn. Once the final drawings were complete, the images were colorized in 24-bit color using Adobe Photoshop. Despite the game's advanced graphics, Pathways was designed to work on any Macintosh model; it was one of 30applications that ran natively on Apple's PowerMacs on launch day.|$|E
25|$|These were {{initially}} <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> on tracing paper using one sheet {{for each of}} the five colours; the various dot or line screens being added using dry transfer screens, for example Letratone manufactured by Letraset in the UK. The map was drawn at twice final map scale, and photographically reduced to produce the five film positives for printing. This was a simple process that required very few specialist tools. Draughting film has replaced tracing paper. This is a plastic waterproof material etched on one side so that the ink will hold.|$|E
5000|$|Equipment changed radically {{during the}} 1990s, when {{computer-aided}} design almost completely ousted <b>drawing</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> Technical design {{has changed from}} <b>drawing</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> to producing computer-aided design drawings, where drawings are no longer [...] "drawn", but are built from a virtually-produced model. Drawings are not necessarily produced in hard copy at all, {{and if they are}} needed they are printed automatically by a computer program. Hand-drawn designs, however, are still widely used in the draft design stage.|$|R

25|$|The museum {{collections}} are {{a collection of}} about 2500 insurance policies, over 300 posters of insurance companies, and a fund of 837 fire plates collected in Italy and Hungary. The collection of policies includes specimens {{from all over the}} world, ranging from the second half of 16th century until the middle of 20th century. The oldest agreements were <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> and provide for the carriage of goods by sea; the fund holds, among others, Maltese policies of the 19th century, policies on the lives of slaves, against the risk of the armed forces and those of the savings on investment from the balilla.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} digitally, but the original backgrounds were <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> and painted {{prior to being}} digitized, and the characters were also <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> prior to scanning them into the computer. The 1400 storyboard cuts for the film were completed on 16 January 2004. On 25 June the in-between animation was completed and checking was completed on 26 June. Studio Ghibli used digital technology to run many copies of the still portions of a scene, a process which avoids inconsistencies between various still frames, but can create an impression of artificiality. Therefore, the studio chose to manually retouch the digitally altered images, recreating the [...] "feel" [...] of a hand-drawn image.|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg {{explained}} that [...] "anything goes" [...] in experimental animation. Although this {{allowed him to}} explore alternatives to conventional methods of filmmaking, he still ventured to employ his own style, which he called [...] "an industry style"; he preferred to traditionally animate his films (where each frame is <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand)</b> rather than, for instance, make cartoons [...] "out of sand by filming piles of sand changing". Hillenburg {{has at least one}} other short film that he made as an animation student, but its title is unspecified.|$|E

500|$|The {{carnival}} in {{this episode}} {{is based on}} The Eastern States Exposition (currently known as The Big E) fair. As a child, Mike Scully went to the fair, and had hoped one day to be a carny. This is the only episode that Mark Kirkland did not tell his parents to watch. This is due to Bart's line [...] "Out of my way, I'm Hitler". Kirkland's stepfather was a lieutenant in World War II and was injured while in combat. Cooder was modeled after David Mirkin, the showrunner of seasons five and six and co-writer and {{the executive producer of}} two episodes in the ninth season. Spud's head shape is modeled after Bart's head. The [...] "fisheye effect", when Cooder is looking through the peep hole was <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> not optically by assistant director Matthew Nastuk. Matt Groening said they had several endings worked out, including one where Homer made the hula hoop over the chimney.|$|E
500|$|In September 2001, Studio Ghibli {{announced}} {{the production of}} Howl's Moving Castle, {{based on the novel}} by Diana Wynne Jones. Mamoru Hosoda of Toei Animation was originally selected to direct the film, but disagreements between Hosoda and Studio Ghibli executives led to the project's abandonment. After six months, Studio Ghibli resurrected the project. Miyazaki was inspired to direct the film upon reading Jones' novel, and was struck by the image of a castle moving around the countryside; the novel does not explain how the castle moved, which led to Miyazaki's designs. He travelled to Colmar and Riquewihr in Alsace, France, to study the architecture and the surroundings for the film's setting. Additional inspiration came from the concepts of future technology in Albert Robida's work, as well as the [...] "illusion art" [...] of 19th century Europe. The film was produced digitally, but the characters and backgrounds were <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> prior to being digitized. It was released on November 20, 2004, and received widespread critical acclaim. The film received the Osella Award for Technical Excellence at the 61st Venice International Film Festival, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. In Japan, the film grossed a record $14.5 million in its first week of release. It remains among the highest-grossing films in Japan, with a worldwide gross of over ¥19.3 billion. Miyazaki received the honorary Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement award at the 62nd Venice International Film Festival in 2005.|$|E
500|$|Pines of Rome was {{the first}} piece Disney {{suggested}} for the film, {{as well as the}} first to be animated; designs appeared in the studio's dailies as early as October 1993. Butoy served as director with James Fujii handling the story. The opening to the piece gave Disney the idea of [...] "something flying". Butoy sketched the sequence on yellow Post-it notes. The story originally involved the whales flying around {{from the perspective of a}} group of penguins, but the idea was scrapped to make the baby whale a central character. The whales were also set to return to Earth but Butoy said it [...] "never felt quite right", leading to the decision to have them break through a cloud ceiling and enter a different world by the supernova. Butoy created a [...] "musical intensity chart" [...] for the animators to follow which [...] "tracked the ups and downs of the music... as the music brightens so does the color", and vice versa. He explained that because CGI was in its infancy during development, the first third of the segment was hand drawn using pencil to get a feel of how the whales would move. When the drawings were scanned into the CAPS system, Butoy found the whales were either moving too fast or had less weight to them. The drawings were altered to make the whales slow down and [...] "more believable". The eyes of the whales were <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> as the desired looks and glances were not fully achievable using CGI. Butoy recalled the challenge of having the water appear and move as naturally as possible; the team decided to write computer code from scratch as traditional animation would have been too time consuming and would have produced undesired results. The code handling the pod of whales was written so the whales would move away if they were to collide and not bump into, overlap, or go through each other. The same technique was used for the stampede scene in The Lion King (1994), which was produced at the same time.|$|E
50|$|The {{structures}} {{within an}} integrated circuit {{and the rules}} (design rules) governing their physical dimensions are often complex, thereby making the structures tedious to <b>draw</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>By</b> using PCells a circuit designer can easily generate {{a large number of}} various structures that only differ in a few parameters, thus increasing design productivity and consistency.|$|R

McCaskill also presided over the elimination of long-standing hallmark academic concentrations at Tech such as aerospace engineering.|$|R
2500|$|Also {{of concern}} were the {{problems}} that the invasion showed with the military. There {{was a lack of}} intelligence about Grenada, which exacerbated the difficulties faced by the quickly assembled invasion force. [...] For example, it was not known that the students were actually at two different campuses and there was a thirty-hour delay in reaching students at the second campus. [...] Maps provided to soldiers on the ground were tourist maps on which military grid reference lines were <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> to report locations of units and request artillery and aircraft fire support. They also did not show topography and were not marked with crucial positions. U.S. Navy ships providing naval gunfire and U.S. Marine, U.S. Air Force and Navy fighter/bomber support aircraft providing close air support mistakenly fired upon and killed U.S. ground forces due to differences in charts and location coordinates, data, and methods of calling for fire support. Communications between services were also noted as not being compatible and hindered the coordination of operations. The landing strip was drawn-in by hand on the map given to some members of the invasion force.|$|E
2500|$|In 1555 or 1556, Le Testu {{published}} a world atlas entitled Cosmographie Universelle selon les Navigateurs, tant anciens que modernes and was consequently awarded {{the title of}} Pilote Royale by Henry II. The Cosmographie Universelle contained 56 maps reportedly based on charts Le Testu had personally <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> on his expeditions. This atlas was dedicated to his mentor and patron Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, who had become leader of the Huguenots three years earlier. The manuscript was based on charts from French, Spanish and Portuguese sources supplied by Coligny. Included in this atlas were twelve charts of Jave le Grand/Terra Australis, which Le Testu located southward of the Moluccas. Le Testu commented: [...] "However, what I have marked and depicted is only by imagination, and I have not noted or remarked {{on any of the}} commodities or incommodities of the place, nor its mountains, rivers or other things; for there has never yet been any man who has made a certain discovery of it." [...] Coligny subsequently supported a proposal from the d'Albagno brothers, for an expedition to Terra Australis to investigate the possibility of a French colony there.|$|E

5000|$|If <b>drawing</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> {{the first}} step is to create or {{download}} a storyboard template. These look much like a blank comic strip, with space for comments and dialogue.

These storyboards get their name because they are rough sketches not bigger than a thumbnail. For some motion pictures, thumbnail storyboards are sufficient.|$|R

60|$|Notwithstanding the {{industry}} and zeal of all engaged, the task was one of great labour and difficulty. The loaded vehicles were to be <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> across a wide distance of plain without track or guide of any sort, except that which the trapper furnished by communicating {{his knowledge of the}} cardinal points of the compass. In accomplishing this object, the gigantic strength of the men was taxed to the utmost, nor were the females or the children spared a heavy proportion of the toil. While the sons distributed themselves about the heavily loaded wagons, and drew them by main strength up the neighbouring swell, their mother and Ellen, surrounded by the amazed group of little ones, followed slowly in the rear, bending under the weight of such different articles as were suited to their several strengths.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next day}} the Highland Light Infantry and the field guns arrived. The former marched in over 700 strong, and made a fine appearance.

The whole camp turned out to look with satisfaction on the long polished tubes, which could throw twelve pounds a thousand yards further than the mountain guns could throw seven. They were, however, not destined to display their power. The Mamunds had again sued for peace. They were weary of the struggle. Their valley was desolate. The season of sowing the autumn crops approached. The arrival of reinforcements convinced them that the Government were determined to get their terms.

60|$|Finally the 29th of March came, and {{fortunately}} there {{having been a}} few days free from rain, {{the surface of the}} ground was dry, giving indications that the time had come when we could move. On that date I moved out with all the army available after leaving sufficient force to hold the line about Petersburg. It soon set in raining again however, and {{in a very short time}} the roads became practically impassable for teams, and almost so for cavalry. Sometimes a horse or mule would be standing apparently on firm ground, when all at once one foot would sink, and as he commenced scrambling to catch himself all his feet would sink and he would have to be <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> out of the quicksands so common in that part of Virginia and other southern States. It became necessary therefore to build corduroy roads every foot of the way as we advanced, to move our artillery upon. The army had become so accustomed to this kind of work, and were so well prepared for it, that it was done very rapidly. The next day, March 30th, we had made sufficient progress to the south-west to warrant me in starting Sheridan with his cavalry over by Dinwiddie with instructions to then come up by the road leading north-west to Five Forks, thus menacing the right of Lee's line.|$|E
60|$|The {{attack was}} made as ordered, and {{perhaps there was}} not a battle of the Mexican war, or of any other, where orders issued before an {{engagement}} were nearer being a correct report of what afterwards took place. Under the supervision of the engineers, roadways had been opened over chasms to the right where the walls were so steep that men could barely climb them. Animals could not. These had been opened under cover of night, without attracting the notice of the enemy. The engineers, who had directed the opening, led the way and the troops followed. Artillery was let down the steep slopes by hand, the men engaged attaching a strong rope to the rear axle and letting the guns down, a piece at a time, while the men at the ropes kept their ground on top, paying out gradually, while a few at the front directed the course of the piece. In like manner the guns were <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> up the opposite slopes. In this way Scott's troops reached their assigned position in rear of most of the intrenchments of the enemy, unobserved. The attack was made, the Mexican reserves behind the works beat a hasty retreat, and those occupying them surrendered. On the left General Pillow's command made a formidable demonstration, which doubtless held a part of the enemy in his front and contributed to the victory. I am not pretending to give full details of all the battles fought, but of the portion that I saw. There were troops engaged on both sides at other points in which both sustained losses; but the battle was won as here narrated.|$|E
