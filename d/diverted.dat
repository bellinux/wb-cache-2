40|$|<b>Diverting</b> {{ileostomy}} {{is believed}} to mitigate the effects of anastomotic complications in low anterior resections (LAR) for rectal cancer. However, there are no data {{about the effects of}} <b>diverting</b> ileostomy on the outcomes of laparoscopic LAR Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 77 consecutive rectal cancer patients who had undergone laparoscopic LAR with (n = 23) or without (n = 54) <b>diverting</b> ileostomy. The patients' data were recorded and supplemented on short-term follow-up visits and included standard demographics, operative procedure, location of the cancer, and final pathologic diagnosis. We noted length of hospitalisation, complications, and time interval from ileostomy creation to closure. Morbidity and mortality were also included. Results: Surgical intervention requiring anastomotic leakage occurred in three patients who underwent laparoscopic LAR without <b>diverting</b> ileostomy. The anastomosis level of patients who underwent laparoscopic LAR with <b>diverting</b> ileostomy was significantly lower than that of patients who underwent laparoscopic LAR without <b>diverting</b> ileostomy (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: Anastomosis level and total mesorectal excision are the main factors for creation of <b>diverting</b> ileostomy in laparoscopic LAR Laparoscopic LAR without <b>diverting</b> ileostomy could be selectively performed. Our study provides a basis for further prospective randomised studies on the role of <b>diverting</b> ileostomy in LAR...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: A <b>diverting</b> stoma {{is known}} to reduce the {{consequences}} of distal anastomotic failure following colorectal sur-gery. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of a <b>diverting</b> stoma after an ultra-low anterior resection (uLAR) for rectal cancer. Methods: Between 2000 and 2007, 836 patients who underwent an uLAR were divided into two groups, depending on the fecal diversion: 246 received fecal diversion, and 590 had no diversion. Patient- and disease-related variables were com-pared between the two groups. Results: Thirty-two of the 836 patients (3. 8 %) had immediate anastomosis-related complications and required reopera-tion. Anastomosis leakage comprised 72 % of the complications (23 / 32). The overall immediate complication rate was sig-nificantly lower in patients with a <b>diverting</b> stoma (0. 8 %, 2 / 246) compared to those without a <b>diverting</b> stoma (5. 1 %, 30 / 590; P = 0. 005). The fecal diversion group had lower tumor location, lower anastomosis level, and more preoperative chemo-radiation therapy (P < 0. 001). In total, 12 % of patients in the <b>diverting</b> stoma group had complications either in making or reversing the stoma (30 / 246). Conclusion: The <b>diverting</b> stoma decreased the rate of immediate anastomosis-related complications. However, the rate of complications associated with the <b>diverting</b> stoma was non-negligible, so strict criteria should be applied when deciding whether to use a <b>diverting</b> stoma...|$|R

5|$|As {{the glaciers}} {{retreated to the}} {{northeast}} about 20,000 years ago, glacial lakes formed. Drainage from the melting glacier and lakes cut a sluiceway, or channel, that <b>diverted</b> the headwaters of South Branch Bowman Creek into the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek. The retreating glaciers also left deposits of debris 20to 30feet (6.1to 9.1m) thick, which formed a dam blocking water from draining into Big Run. Instead water from Ganoga Lake and the area that later became Lake Jean was <b>diverted</b> into the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek. These diversions added about 7square miles (18km²) to the Kitchen Creek drainage basin, increasing it by just over 50percent to 20.1square miles (52km²).|$|E
40|$|To date, Mars robotic {{landing site}} {{selection}} {{has been a}} compromise between scientific interest and safety. Due to the rather large landed footprint major axis lengths of the Viking, Pathfinder, Mars Exploration Rovers, and Phoenix missions, these landed ellipses {{have been placed in}} vast, relatively flat areas to ensure a high probability of landing success. Scientists are interested in exploring more geologically interesting areas that may contain landing hazards, including sloping terrain, craters, and rocks. Smart <b>Divert</b> is a new entry, descent, and landing architecture that could allow robotic missions to safely land in hazardous terrain without the requirement of hypersonic guidance.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} diversion mechanism in matrix acidizing to increase the flow resistance in highly permeable regions due {{to the presence of}} polymer temporary plugs. In this study, three polymers, namely hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl guar (HPG), and xanthan gum were evaluated in the laboratory to determine the best <b>diverting</b> agent to enhance the performance of matrix acidizing. An acidizing system was set-up using coreflooding techniques where Berea sandstone cores saturated with Sarapar were damaged by oil-based mud. Treatment fluids used were mud acid (3 % HF – 12 % HCl), HCl, polymer gels, and ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGMBE) as the mutual solvent. Polymer solutions were prepared at 40 lb/Mgal (4793 ppm) as per field formulation. The experimental results revealed that at low injection pressure, mud acid without <b>diverting</b> agents furnished the best performance where the improvement ratio achieved was 4. 88 at 50 psi (344. 7 kPa), compared with improvement ratio of 2. 42 for HEC, 2. 66 for HPG, and 1. 35 for xanthan gum. However, at higher injection pressure, mud acid with <b>diverting</b> agents gave better results, where at injection pressure of 100 psi (689. 5 kPa), mud acid with HEC <b>diverting</b> agent produced the best result with improvement ratio of 4. 88 compared to 1. 80 for mud acid without <b>diverting</b> agents. Generally, at low injection pressure, mud acid is found to stay longer in the core and has sufficient time to dissolve mud particles. Nevertheless, low injection pressure produces insufficient force to push acid deeper into the formation and fails to dissolve the viscous <b>diverting</b> agents completely. At high injection pressure, there is sufficient force for the acid to dissolve mud particles and viscous <b>diverting</b> agents, hence the <b>diverting</b> agents served its purpose by <b>diverting</b> the mud acid into low permeability zone...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCentralized {{solutions}} for vehicular traffic re-routing to alleviate congestion suffer from two intrinsic problems: scalability, {{as the central}} server has to perform intensive computation and communication with the vehicles in real-time; and privacy, as the drivers have to share their location {{as well as the}} origins and destinations of their trips with the server. This article proposes <b>DIVERT,</b> a distributed vehicular re-routing system for congestion avoidance. <b>DIVERT</b> offloads {{a large part of the}} re-routing computation at the vehicles, and thus, the re-routing process becomes practical in real-time. To take collaborative re-routing decisions, the vehicles exchange messages over vehicular ad hoc networks. <b>DIVERT</b> is a hybrid system because it still uses a server and Internet communication to determine an accurate global view of the traffic. In addition, <b>DIVERT</b> balances the user privacy with the re-routing effectiveness. The simulation results demonstrate that, compared with a centralized system, the proposed hybrid system increases the user privacy by 92 percent on average. In terms of average travel time, <b>DIVERT’s</b> performance is slightly less than that of the centralized system, but it still achieves substantial gains compared to the no re-routing case. In addition, <b>DIVERT</b> reduces the CPU and network load on the server by 99. 99 and 95 percent, respectively...|$|R
