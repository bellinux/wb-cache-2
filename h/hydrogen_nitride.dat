40|$|The {{influence}} of {{hydrogen and oxygen}} on stainless steel implanted by nitrogen low-energy ions is systematically studied. It is shown that hydrogen intervenes moderately in the process only when the oxygen partial pressure in the deposition chamber is relatively high. For very low-oxygen partial pressures, the energetic nitrogen molecules impinging on the substrate sputter the thin oxide layer formed on the substrate. This allows the growing of a rich nitrogen layer beneath the surface, improving the diffusing of the implanted atom deeper in the bulk material. For higher-oxygen partial pressures, the sputtering is ineffective, and an oxide layer partially covers the surface even {{in the presence of}} hydrogen. The maximum depth penetration of nitrogen depends on the degree of oxygen coverage, which is fairly well described by a Langmuir absorption isothermal. Hardness depth profiling is consistent with the existence of a diffusion barrier formed by the oxygen absorbed on the surface. In order to understand the role of <b>hydrogen</b> on the <b>nitriding</b> process, samples preimplanted with hydrogen were subsequently treated with nitrogen and the hardness depth profiling analyzed.

The size of the band gap changes continuously from zero up to 4. 4 eV with increasing pressure, which is understood in terms of the interaction between surface states. Due to the high thermal conductivity of cubic boron nitride and the coupling between band gap and applied pressure, such tunable band gap interfaces may be used in high stable electronic and electromechanical devices.

40|$|Void {{nucleation}} in nitride passivated aluminum interconnects was studied using High Voltage Scanning Electron Microscopy (HVSEM).

Some of the stressinduced and electromigration voids formed away from the interconnect sidewall, which is contrary to images presented in other studies of void nucleation.

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that the use of}} {{nitrogen}} or carbon as alloying elements in plasma diffusion treatment of TiAl 6 V 4 is beneficial for the load-supporting properties of the base material. The plasma diffusion treatment produces a compound layer consisting of nitrides or carbides and an inner diffusion zone, essentially characterized by the presence of nitrogen- or carbon-rich alpha-Ti crystals which are embedded in the metal matrix. This results in a hardness gradient from the interior to the surface. To avoid <b>hydrogen</b> embrittlement, plasma <b>nitriding</b> is performed in a pure nitrogen atmosphere. The formation of soot by carburizing could be avoided by optimizing the carbon flow during plasma carburizing. The influence of plasma nitriding and carburizing on the adhesion of the TiC coating depends on the plasma diffusion pretreatment and the conditions of the TiC coating. Plasma-nitrocarburizing pretreatment leads to the best adhesion of the TiC coating; the critical load of failure is 80 % higher than in the case of TiC on base material. A critical load of approximately 33 N was found under the optimum parameters. We conclude that the combination of plasma diffusion treatment and TiC coating extends the tribological applicability of TiAl 6 V 4 in many industrial sectors.

40|$|Atomic layer {{deposition}} (ALD) {{of highly}} conformal, silicon-based dielectric thin films has become necessary {{because of the}} continuing decrease in feature size in microelectronic devices. The ALD of oxides and nitrides is usually thought to be mechanistically similar, but plasma-enhanced ALD of silicon nitride {{is found to be}} problematic, while that of silicon oxide is straightforward. To find why, the ALD of silicon nitride and silicon oxide dielectric films was studied by applying ab initio methods to theoretical models for proposed surface reaction mechanisms. The thermodynamic energies for the elimination of functional groups from different silicon precursors reacting with simple model molecules were calculated using density functional theory (DFT), explaining the lower reactivity of precursors toward the deposition of silicon nitride relative to silicon oxide seen in experiments, but not explaining the trends between precursors. Using more realistic cluster models of amine and hydroxyl covered surfaces, the structures and energies were calculated of reaction pathways for chemisorption of different silicon precursors via functional group elimination, with more success. DFT calculations identified the initial physisorption step as crucial toward deposition and this step was thus used to predict the ALD reactivity of a range of amino-silane precursors, yielding good agreement with experiment. The retention of <b>hydrogen</b> within silicon <b>nitride</b> films but not in silicon oxide observed in FTIR spectra was accounted for by the theoretical calculations and helped verify the application of the model...|$|R

The nitrogenation {{was carried out by}} using nitrogen gas or ammonia. With the nitrogen gas approach, {{it was found that the}} system was separated into nitrided and unnitrided regions, and that a strong interaction existed between interstitial nitrogen and lattice. NMR measurements of 89 Y suggest that nitrogen predominately occupies 2 out of 3 octahedral sites in Y 2 Fe 17 N 2. 6. In the case of Sm 2 Fe 17 N 2. 6, both lattice expansion and electronic interaction between nitrogen and Sm are responsible for the enhancement of magnetization and formation of room temperature uniaxial anisotropy. With an ammonia nitrogenation approach, pronounced differences such as nitrogenation temperature, duration, nitrogen content and occupancy have been explored, together with some similarities, such as lattice expansion and phase separation. These observations suggest that the nitrided portion in the ammonia prepared samples has a higher nitrogen content. ^ The hydrogenation process is reversible in both R 2 Fe 17 hydrides and Y 2 Fe 17 nitri-hydrides, and the filling of both octahedral and tetrahedral sites has been suggested by the experiments, even though the loading of <b>hydrogen</b> into <b>nitrides</b> must be carried out at a higher temperature and a longer duration. In addition, the influence of hydrogen on the hyperfine field of 89 Y is different. For hydrides, the center of gravity of the 89 Y peak shifts down with hydrogenation, and no 89 Y satellite peaks appear, but with nitri-hydrides, the NMR spectrum of 89 Y behaves as if additional nitrogen were added into the lattice. ^ Room temperature uniaxial anisotropy is found for Sm 2 Fe 17 -yGay with Ga content in the range of 3 to 4, in spite of the fact that Ga substitution reduces the basal plane anisotropy of the Fe sublattice. The experimental results reveal that the Ga occupancy is selective. The different occupation pattern of Ga between the hexagonal Y 2 Fe 17 -xGax and rhombohedral Sm 2 Fe 17 -xGax is related to the difference in lattice structure. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is {{evaluation}} of behaviour of plasma nitrided layers subjected to influence of internal and external <b>hydrogen.</b> Properties of <b>nitrided</b> layers like: <b>hydrogen</b> permeation and trapping, fracture mode, and plasticity were examined. Design/methodology/approach: Structural low-alloy steel was nitrided at glow discharge in the gas mixture of various N 2, H 2, and Ar content. Samples with nitrided layers were subjected to cathodic hydrogen charging in acid solution simulating the aged engine oil hydrogenating environment. The effect of the nitrided layers on the hydrogen transport and on the irreversible trapping was evaluated by the measurements of the hydrogen permeation rate and by the vacuum extraction, respectively. Surfaces with modified layers were examined {{with the use of a}} scanning electron microscope (SEM) before and after hydrogen permeation tests. Slow strain rate test (SSRT) on samples with and without nitrided layers was carried out in hydrogen generating environment. After SSRT fracture mode and plasticity of nitrided layers were examined with SEM. Findings: In the presence of the not defected compact <b>nitride</b> layer, no <b>hydrogen</b> permeation through the steel has been stated under the experimental conditions. Influence of hydrogen content in working atmosphere, i. e. internal hydrogen, was found. Absorbed hydrogen, i. e. external hydrogen, was accumulated within this layer. Research limitations/implications: There is no possibility to perform direct observations of exact mechanism of hydrogen-assisted cracking so far. Further research should be taken to reveal the exact mechanism of increased plasticity of nitrided layer with absorbed hydrogen. Practical implications: Plasma nitrided layers are effective barriers to hydrogen entry into structural steel utilised in aggressive environments, which is especially important in the case of possible hydrogen charging of exploited steel. Originality/value: Using the atmosphere of the higher nitrogen to hydrogen ratio at plasma assisted nitriding provides the formation of thin compact nitride zone, highly protective against corrosion and hydrogen degradation.

40|$|Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) {{is known}} as the most {{practical}} way to convert natural gas to hydrocarbon products including synthetic fuel depending on the catalysts and operating conditions. Australia has 25 % of world's natural gas resources hence Australia's crude oil dependency can be reduced extensively by developing catalysts that will facilitate the technique of converting natural gas to synthetic fuel. Molybdenum nitride has been employed in this study for FTS because of its superior mechanical strength, stability, exceptional resistance to carbon deposition & suifur poisoning. In particular, molybdenum nitride is endowed with similar electronic properties to those of noble metals. Other transition metal nitrides such as Co nitride and Co-Mo nitride were also investigated in this study. The physicochemical attributes of nitride catalysts were examined by BET surface area, particle dispersion, acid site strength & concentration, and surface elemental composition. Gas to solid nitridation kinetic was thermogravimetrically monitored. CO hydrogenation activity was measured in a fixed bed reactor using various syngas compositions and temperatures at atmospheric pressure. The effect of nitridation conditions on catalytic properties of nitrides was investigated via 23 factorial design. It has revealed that nitridation parameters; temperature, nitriding gas composition (H 2 :NH 3) and nitridation reaction time were all significantly influencing catalyst properties. The optimal nitridation condition was 973 K, H 2 :NH 3 = 1 : 1, and 4 hours of nitriding time which gave higher alkene selectivity. 20 wt% M 02 N/Ah 03 was found to be the better FT catalyst compare to catalysts with lower Mo loading and other inorganic oxide supports.

40|$|The synthesis, crystal {{structures}} and dielectric properties of perovskite oxynitrides {{of the type}} LnTiO 2 N (Ln = La, Nd and mixtures) and ATaO 2 N (A = Ca, Sr, Ba and mixtures), have been investigated. The end-member oxynitrides and their associated LaxNd 1 -xTiO 2 N, CaxSr 1 -xTaO 2 N and BaxSr 1 -xTaO 2 N solid solutions were successfully prepared by ammonolysis of the appropriate precursor oxides at temperatures in the range 900 - 1200 ºC. The complete range of LaxNd 1 -xTiO 2 N solid solution are orthorhombic perovskites, which show a small increase in unit cell parameters with increasing La content across the range. Compositions in the CaxSr 1 -xTaO 2 N series are tetragonal for x 0. 6. BaxSr 1 -xTaO 2 N solid solutions are tetragonal for x 0. 5. It was impossible to form any perovskite solid solution in the BaTaO 2 N-CaTaO 2 N series. Attempts were made to densify these oxynitrides by hot-pressing and spark plasma sintering, but a characteristic of all these oxynitride structures {{is that they are}} stable up to relatively low temperatures (1250 oC) with decomposition occurring before any sintering can be achieved. A reducing environment is necessary to prevent oxidation, but this must not be too reducing to promote conversion of the transition metal into a lower oxidation state. As a result, fully dense samples were not obtained and dielectric property measurements could not be made on these samples. As an alternative, pure single phase LaTiO 2 N, NdTiO 2 N and LaxNd 1 -xTiO 2 N solid solutions were prepared as » 3 μm thick surface layers on dense pellets of the corresponding La 2 Ti 2 O 7, Nd 2 Ti 2 O 7 and (LaxNd 1 -x) 2 Ti 2 O 7) oxides by ammonolysis. The bulk dielectric properties of these VI coated samples were then measured by LCR bridge techniques. The presence of an oxynitride layer significantly increased the measured dielectric constant of all samples, compared with the pure oxides, but a significantly higher dielectric loss was also observed. This lossy behaviour is believed to be due to the presence of a more conductive region of reduced La 2 Ti 2 O 7 (of typical composition 2 2 7 La TiIV TiIIIO -x x -z) situated immediately below the oxynitride layer, produced during synthesis by the presence of <b>hydrogen</b> in the <b>nitriding</b> ammonia atmosphere. The dielectric constant of all these oxynitrides was also measured in particulate form by impedance analysis of slurries and the dielectric constant calculated by a method of mixtures. Compared with the parent oxides, the dielectric constants were noticeably larger, ranging from 100 - 1500. These values are in reasonable agreement with the limited amount of data available in the literature, and show that this group of materials merits further exploration, providing easier synthesis routes can be developed, which also result in low loss final materials being obtained.
