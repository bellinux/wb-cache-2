Regulatory roles of GA in seed germination have been extensively studied. It is also known that high salinity inhibits germination by repressing genes encoding GA biosynthetic enzymes. However, it is still unclear how salt signals are coordinately incorporated into the GA signaling pathway at the molecular level. We recently demonstrated that a membrane-bound NAC transcription factor, NTL 8, mediates salt signaling, primarily through a RGL 2 -independent GA pathway, in regulating seed germination. High salinity promotes NTL 8 transcription and proteolytic activation of NTL 8. Notably, the NTL 8 -mediated salt signaling is independent of abscisic acid (ABA).

40|$|A central step in {{nucleoside}} and nucleobase salvage pathways is the hydrolysis of nucleosides {{to their}} respective nucleobases. In plants this is solely accomplished by nucleosidases (EC 3. 2. 2. x). To elucidate the importance of nucleosidases for nucleoside degradation, general metabolism, <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> growth, thorough phenotypic and biochemical analyses were performed using Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA insertion mutants lacking expression of the previously identified genes annotated as uridine ribohydrolases (URH 1 and URH 2). Comprehensive functional analyses of single and double mutants demonstrated that both isoforms are unimportant for seedling <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> growth, while one participates in uridine degradation. Rather unexpectedly, nucleoside and nucleotide profiling and nucleosidase activity screening of soluble crude extracts revealed a deficiency of xanthosine and inosine hydrolysis in the single mutants, with substantial accumulation of xanthosine in one of them. Mixing of the two mutant extracts, and by in vitro activity reconstitution using a mixture of recombinant URH 1 and URH 2 proteins, both restored activity, thus providing biochemical evidence that at least these two isoforms are needed for inosine and xanthosine hydrolysis.

40|$|Seed {{imbibition}} is {{an important}} process in the <b>plant</b> life cycle <b>and</b> determines whether seed germination <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> growth will be successful or not. Ricinus communis is becoming an important crop for oil production, and therefore, studying the physiological and biochemical aspects of seed imbibition and germination may aid in the improvement of crop quality and yield. Metabolite profiling was performed {{in order to assess}} biochemical changes associated with the temperature during early seed imbibition. Changes in the metabolite profile were already detected within 2 h of imbibition, but they were more prominent after 8 h. An increased level of glycerol and fatty acids upon a few hours of imbibition suggests that lipid mobilization occurs shortly after water uptake begins. Fumarate and succinate levels increased after 2 h of imbibition, suggesting that energy metabolism is reactivated relatively early in this species. Seeds imbibed at 20 and 25 °C showed an overall accumulation of carbohydrates, while at 35 °C increased levels of some amino acids were observed. Ascorbate content was 30 -fold higher in seeds imbibed for 8 h at 35 °C as compared to seeds imbibed at 20 °C, suggesting that 35 °C is a stress condition for R. communis seeds. In this study, we have demonstrated that temperature {{plays an important role in}} water uptake rate, reserve mobilization and reactivation of metabolism during early seed imbibition. Additionally, we demonstrated that this species possess a specific metabolic signature which is not restricted to the imbibition period, but also during seedling <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> growth...|$|R

40|$|Ecosystem {{degradation}} {{may reduce}} biodiversity, including <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> fungi. Although restoration ecologists rarely specify fungal restoration as a desired outcome, restoration methods may either promote or inhibit fungi. Direct fungal restoration may provide benefits to ecosystems and support restoration efforts, but {{little is known}} about how either degradation or restoration affect fungi. 		We investigated how fungi respond to habitat fragmentation in coastal sage scrub (CSS) ecosystems. Using molecular and fluorimetric techniques, we found that leaf-litter fungal activity declined in smaller fragments with less diverse vegetation. We manipulated plant litter diversity using litter bags and found less mass remaining in litter bags containing more diverse litter. Moreover, these litter bags harbored greater numbers of fungal taxa. Our findings suggest that plant diversity controls decomposer fungal diversity and function in fragmented ecosystems. 		Fragmented landscapes are particularly vulnerable to plant invasions. Both invasive <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> invasive removal methods may harm native <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> fungi. Within invaded CSS ecosystems, we compared invasive plant removal methods, monitored <b>plant</b> communities, <b>and</b> extracted soil fungi. While both herbicide and mowing reduced invasive cover, neither method promoted native plant recovery. Herbicide however had the added benefit of facilitating fungal recovery. 		Mycorrhizal fungal recovery may support restoration outcomes by providing benefits to plants. However, it is unclear whether directly manipulating mycorrhizal fungi via inoculation has consistent effects across ecosystems or long-term effects on colonization, and whether types of inocula differ in their effectiveness. We synthesized data from restoration studies across ecosystems {{to examine the effects of}} inoculation on mycorrhizal <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> growth under field conditions. We found that inoculation consistently increased mycorrhizal abundance across ecosystem types and improved growth <b>and</b> <b>establishment</b> of <b>plants</b> long-term. Both fungi from reference ecosystems and species-specific inoculum improved mycorrhizal associations with plants more than did commercial fungi. 	Landscape degradation inhibits certain groups of fungi that either cycle nutrients or support plants. Depending on the method used, restoration may either not have any effect on fungi or may promote fungal recovery. We conclude that incorporating fungi into restoration efforts may better facilitate the establishment of both belowground and aboveground components of ecosystems...|$|R

More specifically, we aimed at (1) determining topographic thresholds for plant colonisation, (2) identifying the soil properties that limit <b>plant</b> <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> (3) identifying <b>plant</b> traits that enable colonising species to cope with these limitations. We used slope angle and aspect as surrogates of erosion rate and water availability respectively. Since soil erosion and water availability can limit <b>plant</b> <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> both interact in the landscape, we analysed variations in colonisation success with slope angle and aspect. Vegetation success was measured in terms of total vegetation cover on 156 different slopes. After determining slope angle thresholds for plant colonisation, soil was sampled on slopes just above and just below the threshold values for soil analysis in order to test for differences in soil properties related to <b>plant</b> <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> development. <b>Plant</b> traits related to plant colonising capacity were analysed in two different groups of species: the group of species colonising the steep slopes near the threshold and the group of noncolonising species present on more gentie slopes but unable to colonise the slopes just below the threshold. The identified slope angle threshold values for plant colonisation clearly decreased from North to South. No differences were found in soil properties neither among slope aspects at the slope angle threshold values nor between slope positions (just below and above the threshold) within slope aspect classes. Long-distance dispersal mechanisms and ability of seeds to segregate mucilage in contact with water were more frequent characteristics in colonising species than in non-colonising ones. It is concluded that water availability for plants which, in turn, is controlled by the solar radiation can explain the differences in the slope angle threshold values for plant colonisation among slope aspect classes. Some important implications of these results in the context of ecological restoration of these severely eroded areas are also discussed. status: publishe...|$|R

Therefore, this process was investigated in the study reported in this paper in laboratory-based tripartite mesocosms containing the shrub Arctostaphylos viscida (manzanita) and young seedlings of sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). The objectives were to determine whether water could be transported through mycorrhizal symbionts shared by establishing conifers and A. viscida and to compare the results obtained using two tracers: the stable isotope deuterium and the dye lucifer yellow carbohydrazide. Water containing the tracers {{was added to the}} central compartment containing single manzanita shrubs. The fungal hyphae were then collected as well as plant roots from coniferous seedlings in the other two compartments to determine whether water was transferred via fungal hyphae. In addition, the length of the hyphae and degree of mycorrhizal colonisation were determined. Internal transcribed spacer–restriction fragment length polymorphism (ITS-RFLP) analysis was used to identify the fungal species involved in dye (water) transfer. Results of the stable isotope analysis showed that water is transferred via mycorrhizal hyphae, but isotopically labelled water was only detected in Douglas-fir roots, not in sugar pine roots. In contrast, the fluorescent dye was transported via mycorrhizal hyphae to both Douglas-fir and sugar pine seedlings. Only 1 of 15 fungal morphotypes (identified as Atheliaceae) growing in the mesocosms transferred the dye. Differences were detected in the water transfer patterns indicated by the deuterium and fluorescent dye tracers, suggesting that the two labels are transported by different mechanisms in the same hyphae and/or that different fungal taxa transfer them via different routes to host plants. We conclude that both tracers can provide information on resource transfer between fungi <b>and</b> <b>plants,</b> but we cannot be sure that the dye transfer data provide accurate indications of water transfer rates and patterns.

Survival of Atriplex under WH systems is critical only in the first year of <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> earlier <b>planting</b> guarantees better production. The new technique proved to substitute the costly and time-consuming traditional manual one. Further improvements are still viable...|$|R
40|$|A pot {{experiment}} in glasshouse {{was conducted with}} a single salinity level of 10. 5 dS m - 1 to study the effect of alternating saline and non-saline conditions on emergence and seedling growth of two rice cultivars (IR 8 and V 3) differing in salt tolerance. A split-plot design was used with three replications. The results demonstrated that rice seedlings, 1 to 3 weeks after emergence, proved to be very salt-sensitive. There was about 80 % reduction in stand establishment in 10. 5 dS m - 1 salt (about 115 mM) imposed for just one week. Maintaining rice seeds in saline conditions from seeding resulted in 50 - 70 % initial seedling emergence. However, most seedlings then died within 14 days and by 42 days, only 5 % or less survived. Though substantial differences existed between cultivars during germination and emergence, cultivar differences during post-emergence growth were minimal. Little improvement in stand <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> seedling growth was achieved by ameliorating an initial exposure to salt by transferring to water after 21 - 35 days. The results demonstrated a gradual decrease in seedling mortality with later exposure to salt. There was little effect on stand <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> other <b>plant</b> growth parameters when saline solution was introduced 35 days from seeding. Tolerance to a given salt concentration during germination and emergence of rice was not accompanied by the plants tolerance to that particular salt concentration at later stages of growth...|$|R
