500|$|To try {{to raise}} its own standards, the LSO had engaged Mengelberg, a famous orchestral trainer, known as a perfectionist. He made it a {{precondition}} that the deputy system must be abandoned, which occurred in 1929. He conducted the orchestra for the 1930 season, and music critics commented on the improvement in the playing. Nonetheless, as patently the third-best orchestra in London, the LSO lost work it had long been used to, including the Covent Garden seasons, the Royal Philharmonic Society concerts and the Courtauld-Sargent concerts. The orchestra persuaded Sir Hamilton Harty, the popular conductor of the Hallé Orchestra, to move from Manchester to become the LSO's principal conductor. Harty brought with him eight of the Hallé's leading players to replenish the LSO's ranks, depleted by defections to the BBC and Beecham. Critics including Neville Cardus recognised the continued improvement in the LSO's playing: [...] "On this evening's hearing the London Symphony Orchestra is likely, after all, to give its two rivals a gallant run. Under Sir Hamilton <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>certainly</b> take on a style of sincere expression, distinguished from the virtuoso brilliance cultivated by the B.B.C. Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Beecham." [...] Among the milestones on the orchestra's path to recovery were the premieres of Walton's Belshazzar's Feast (1930) and First Symphony (1934), showing the orchestra [...] "capable of rising {{to the challenge of}} the most demanding contemporary scores" [...] (Morrison).|$|E

According to Apple, it intended for Pippin {{to be more than}} just a platform for game consoles. [...] "Apple believes that over time Pippin will take many forms, including home telecommunication devices and much more. Apple did not want to choose a name that would be specific for a certain market space, as <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>certainly</b> appeal to many types of consumers and be shipped in a variety of forms from many manufacturers." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{deciding}} whether Marbury had a remedy, Marshall stated: [...] "The Government of the United States has been emphatically termed {{a government of}} laws, and not of men. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>certainly</b> cease to deserve this high appellation if the laws furnish no remedy for the violation of a vested legal right." [...] One of the key legal principles on which Marbury relies {{is the notion that}} for every violation of a vested legal right, there must be a legal remedy. Marshall next described two distinct types of Executive actions: political actions, where the official can exercise discretion, and purely ministerial functions, where the official is legally required to do something. Marshall found that delivering the appointment to Marbury was a purely ministerial function required by law, and therefore the law provided him a remedy.|$|E
