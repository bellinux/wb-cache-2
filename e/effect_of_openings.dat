30|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to estimate the}} <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>openings</b> between cell walls on combined bound water and water vapor diffusion in wood. Using a newly developed model, the radial and tangential moisture diffusion coefficients can be predicted depending on the opening area. The new model explicitly involves a term for water vapor diffusion through the openings, {{as well as a}} term for the combined diffusion of bound water and water vapor. A classical model developed by Stamm and Choong had higher longitudinal moisture diffusion coefficients than that in the parallel model at higher moisture content, which is inconsistent with the Wiener bound rule. The new model suggested in this article is useful for analyzing the experimental results and understanding the variability of the diffusion coefficients.|$|E

Hollowcore slabs are prestressed precast slab elements which have longitudinal cores running along the longitudinal (length) span. Provision of cores results in reduction of dead weight and leads to efficient cross section as it increases the effect of prestressing due to reduced cross sectional area. In some instances, openings/cut-outs are introduced in the hollowcore slabs due to various structural and service requirements. This can cause reduction in capacity, stiffness and can change the failure mode of hollowcore slabs.

Generally, locations of tank openings are at the first layer of shell course which are just close to elephant’s foot buckling position of oil tanks. While learning the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>openings</b> on elephant’s foot buckling of oil tanks, the welding residual deformation {{was assumed to be}} initial geometric imperfections. Numerical simulation method was adopted to analyze the effect of three factors (oil tanks with or without openings, opening sizes and opening positions) on elephant’s foot buckling critical load of oil tanks.

Firstly, natural response of plates with openings and carlings is calculated from the eigenvalue equation derived by using Lagrange's equation of motion.

Mindlin theory is adopted for plate modelling and the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>openings</b> is taken into account by subtracting their potential and kinetic energies from the corresponding plate energies. Natural and frequency response of plates with openings and carlings subjected to point excitation force and enforced acceleration at boundaries, respectively, is analysed by using developed in-house code.

The damping factor commonly used for code-based dynamic analysis was evaluated based on seismic response measured during shake table tests of six low-rise concrete walls.

The effect of failure mode on damping factor is discussed. An equation for estimating damping associated with a particular vibration period value is also proposed.

40|$|Framed {{structures}} are usually infilled with masonry walls. These may cause {{significant increase in}} both stiffness and strength, reducing the deformation demand and increasing the energy dissipation capacity of the system. On the other hand, irregular arrangements of the masonry panels {{may lead to the}} concentration of damage in some regions, with negative effects, like for example soft storey mechanisms and shear failures in short columns. Therefore, the presence of infill walls should not be neglected, especially in regions of moderate and high seismicity. To this aim, simple models are available for solid infills walls, such as the diagonal no-tension strut model, while infilled frames with openings have not been investigated adequately. In the present study the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>openings</b> on strength and stiffness of infilled frames is studied by means of about 150 experimental and numerical tests.

Two types of openings are investigated: central window openings and {{different combinations of}} door and window openings based on the typologies of southern European countries. First, a finite element model of the structure is made using the DIANA software program. Then, after calibration with experimental results, a parametric analysis is carried out to investigate {{the effect of the}} presence and location of the different types of openings on the in-plane behaviour of the infilled frame. Finally, different equations for predicting the initial stiffness and lateral strength of infilled frames with any types of openings were obtained. An α factor related to the geometry of the piers between openings is proposed {{to take into account the}} location of the openings in the developed equations. Subsequently, the masonry infill panel is replaced by a diagonal strut. An empirical equation is also proposed for the width of an equivalent strut to replace a masonry infill panel with openings in such a way that they possess the same initial stiffness.

Understanding the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>openings</b> and the resulting tsunami force is essential for an economical and safe design of vertical evacuation shelters against tsunamis. One-to-one hundred scale building models with square shape in plan were tested in a 40 m long hydraulic flume with 1 m x 1 m cross section. A mild slope of 0. 5 degree representing the beach condition at Phuket, Thailand was simulated in the hydraulic laboratory. The model dimensions were 150 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm.

A bi-linear pressure profile is proposed for determining the maximum tsunami force acting on solid square buildings. The influence of openings on the peak pressures on the front face of the model is found to be practically insignificant. For 25 % and 50 % opening models, the tsunami forces reduce by about 15 % and 30 % from the model without openings, respectively.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a steady-state or transient, three-dimensional mathematical field model describing aircraft cabin fires. The fire is modelled {{by a simple}} heat source, and the simulation is intended to represent non-spreading fires. The computer code implementing the model uses a body-fitted coordinate (BFC) formulation to describe accurately {{the interior of the}} aircraft, that is neither Cartesian nor polar-cylindrical. The model is first used to predict the experimental results obtained from a series of fire tests performed in a Boeing- 737 fuselage (without fittings). Both steady-state and transient results are presented and discussed. Then the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>openings</b> in the fuselage and cabin compartmentation on the temperature distribution within the empty aircraft cabin is investigated. With the forward and aft bulkhead doors open, allowing for natural convection, the temperatures are kept to tolerate levels. When the forward door is closed while the aft is kept open, temperatures increase throughout the cabin even in the aft section. With both forward and aft doors open, the cabin is partitioned into two communicating sections, the forward section containing the fire. When compared to the non-compartmented case temperatures in the aft section decrease while temperatures in the forward section increase. With the cabin fitted with seats, ceiling panels and overhead stowage bins the effect of the aircraft's air-conditioning system on the temperature distribution within the burning fuselage is examined. The results suggest that a reverse flow situation (i. e. cold air injected through floor vents and hot air sucked out at ceiling vents) greatly reduces the temperature throughout the fuselage. It is concluded that, although insufficiently validated as yet {{due to the lack of}} extensive and suitable experimental data, the model is promising...|$|E
