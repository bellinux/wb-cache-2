40|$|Studies {{were made}} to {{determine}} the incidence of hatching of honey bee, Apis mellifera L., eggs incubated in various positions. Petri dishes with basal layers of wax, paraffin, or drone foundation were used as supporting surfaces for eggs. The lowest successful hatching incidence was 58 % for eggs kept in the inverted position; the highest incidence was 67 % in an ordinary prone position. The averagc hatching incidence of 62 % shows that hatching is not influenced strongly by {{the position of the}} egg. Eggs placed into petri dishes but without regard to their position showed an average of 78 % hatchability. The resulting larvae, reared artificially on larval food, showed normal growth and development. Excessivc shaking or bumping does not appear to affect satisfactory hatching.

The high intensity of the 3, 358 cm− 1 band in the FTIR spectra showed an increase of hydrogen–bonding interactions between P(3 HB) and EC at that distinct wavelength region. The morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy, which showed the well dispersed P(3 HB) in the backbone polymer of EC. X-ray diffraction pattern for P(3 HB) showed distinct peaks at 2 -theta values of 28 °, 32 °, 34 °, 39 °, 46 °, 57 °, 64 °, 78 ° and 84 °. In comparison with those of neat P(3 HB), the degree of crystallinity for P(3 HB) -g-EC decreased. The tensile strength, elongations at break and Young’s modulus of P(3 HB) -g-EC reached the highest levels in comparison to the film prepared with pure P(3 HB) only, which was too brittle to measure any of the above said characteristics. Results obtained in the present study suggest P(3 HB) -g-EC as a potential candidate for various biotechnological applications, such as tissue engineering and packaging...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} was conducted {{to determine the effects}} of three different grafting periods (March 1, April 1 and May 1) and six grafting methods (tongue, splice, cleft graft-ing by hand and cleft, wedge, omega grafting by three different manual grafting tools) on graft success and plant growth in persimmon sapling production. The experiment was car-ried out in a randomized complete block design with three replications in Rize, Turkey during 2012 – 2013. The ‘Hachiya ’ persimmon (Diospyros kaki L.) were used for grafting scions. Two-year old Diospyros lotus L. seedling were used for rootstocks. In conclusion, graft take percentages varied from 21. 7 to 81. 7 % in 2012, from 10. 0 to 73. 3 % in 2013. Sprouting percentages varied from 11. 7 to 73. 3 % in 2012, from 5. 0 to 68. 3 % in 2013. These parameters, tongue and wedge grafting (with tool) performed on April 1 gave the highest results in both years. Graft shoot lengths varied from 38. 6 to 65. 7 cm in 2012, from 38. 3 to 61. 5 cm in 2013. Graft shoot diameters varied from 5. 3 to 8. 3 mm in 2012, from 5. 5 to 7. 8 mm in 2013. These parameters, splice grafting performed on April 1 gave the highest results in both years. In generally among all parameters the best type of graft-ing was tongue and wedge (with tool) grafting. The omega grafting with manual <b>grafting</b> <b>tool</b> gave the lowest results in all parameters.

30|$|The {{virulence}} {{test was}} conducted at the Laboratory of Molecular Entomology and Bee Pathology (L-MEB), Ghent University following the protocol described by de Graaf et al. (2013) using Apis mellifera carnica larvae. Briefly, plates each consisting of 24 -wells were incubated at 34  °C for 24  h. A group of 30 larvae (in 3 wells) was treated with the Ugandan P. larvae isolate, another group of 30 larvae was treated with the P. larvae strain BRL 230010. Six (6) wells were left empty and filled with 1  ml of distilled water to avoid desiccation. Three hundred (300) µl of the spore-contaminated larval diet (20 spores of P. larvae/µl feed) was pipetted into each well of the treatment group. Three wells for the negative control group were left and fed on non-spore contaminated larval diet during the entire experiment. After 24  h of infection, larvae were transferred to a pre-warmed, fresh normal larval diet plate. The <b>grafting</b> <b>tool</b> was decontaminated between each group to avoid reinfection. Every treatment group received fresh larval diet every 24  h and the plates were analyzed each day under a stereo microscope to determine the health status of the larvae. Old feed was removed daily and replaced with pre-warmed fresh larval diet. After defecation (day 8), the larvae were transferred to pupation plates. Larvae were classified as dead when they stopped breathing (movement of tracheal openings stops) and lost body elasticity. The number of dead larvae was recorded every day. To determine whether P. larvae infection caused {{the death of a}} larva, dead larvae were plated out on MYPGP plates. Plates were incubated for 3  days at 37  °C to allow the growth of vegetative bacteria. Positive AFB infection was confirmed by growth of P. larvae. Further confirmation was provided by performing P. larvae-specific PCR-analysis of colonies grown from larval remains.|$|E
40|$|Bacterial {{cellulose}} (BC) exhibits high purity, {{mechanical strength}} and an ultra-fine fibrous 3 -D network structure with bio-compatible and bio-degradable characteristics, while P(3 HB) are a bio-degradable matrix material derived from natural resources. Herein, we report a mild and eco-friendly fabrication of indigenously isolated P(3 HB) based novel composites consisting of BC (a straight-chain polysaccharide) as a backbone polymer and laccase {{was used as}} a <b>grafting</b> <b>tool.</b> The resulting composites were characterised by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analyser (DMA) and water contact angle analyser (WCA). The FTIR spectra of the pure P(3 HB) and P(3 HB) containing graft composites [P(3 HB) -g-BC] showed their strong characteristic bands at 3358 cm− 1, 1721 cm− 1 and 1651 cm− 1, respectively. A homogenous dispersion of P(3 HB) in the backbone polymer of BC was achieved as evident by the SEM micrographs. XRD pattern for P(3 HB) showed distinct peaks at 2 θ values that represent the crystalline nature of P(3 HB). While, in comparison with those of neat P(3 HB), the degree of crystallinity for P(3 HB) -g-BC decreased and this reduction is mainly because of the new cross-linking of P(3 HB) within the backbone polymer that changes the morphology and destroys the crystallites. Laccase-assisted graft composite prepared from P(3 HB) and BC was fairly flexible and strong, judged by the tensile strength (64. 5 MPa), elongations at break (15. 7 %), and Young's modulus (0. 98 GPa) because inherently high strength of BC allowed the mechanical properties of P(3 HB) to improve in the P(3 HB) -g-BC composite. The hydrophilic property of the P(3 HB) -g-BC was much better than that of the individual counterparts which is also a desired characteristic to enhance the biocompatibility of the materials for proper cell adhesion and proliferation...|$|E

40|$|The VORTEC (VIABAHN open revascularization {{technique}}) and {{the chimney}} <b>graft</b> technique are <b>tools</b> {{with which to}} maintain or restore {{blood flow to the}} aortic branches and can be used intentionally or as a bailout procedure in open surgery or endovascular procedures. VORTEC is a stent graft-based vascular connection technique that achieves end-to-end anastomosis configuration; it is especially useful when the traditional suture technique proves (can be) cumbersome. It is also a speedy tool with virtually no blood flow interruption and no anastomotic bleeding, and patency rates compare favorably with sutured anastomosis. The chimney/periscope, as well as the sandwich graft technique (CHIMPES), is an endovascular tool using parallel endografts for maintaining or restoring blood flow to aortic branches, whereas the conventional aortic stent graft will land above their origin. It is a relatively speedy procedure allowing the use of off-the-shelf devices, even for emergency cases. When parallel grafts run in between two aortic stent graft devices, the term“sandwich” is used. Based on the published experience, both techniques seem particularly useful in aortic arch and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair, especially in high-risk or acute cases...|$|R
40|$|The {{quest for}} skin {{expansion}} is {{not restricted to}} cover a large area alone, but to produce acceptable uniform surfaces, robust engraftment to withstand mechanical shear and infection, with a minimal donor morbidity. Ease of the technique, shorter healing period and reproducible results are essential parameters to adopt novel techniques. Significant advances seen in four fronts of autologous grafting are: (1) Dermal–epidermal graft expansion techniques, (2) epidermal graft harvests technique, (3) melanocyte-rich basal cell therapy for vitiligo and (4) robust and faster autologous cell cultures. Meek's original concept that the sum of perimeter of smaller grafts {{is larger than the}} harvested graft, and smaller the graft size, the greater is the potential for regeneration is witnessed in newer modification. Further, as graft size becomes smaller or minced, these micrografts can survive on the wound bed exudate irrespective of their dermal orientation. Expansion produced by 4 mm × 4 mm sized Meek micrografts is 10 -folds, similarly 0. 8 mm × 0. 8 mm size micrografts produce 100 -fold expansion, which becomes 700 -fold with pixel grafts of 0. 3 mm × 0. 3 mm size. Fractional skin harvest is another new technique with 700 μ size full thickness graft. These provide instant autologous non-cultured graft to cover extensive areas with similar quality of engraftment surface as split skin <b>grafts.</b> Newer <b>tools</b> for epidermal blister graft harvest quickly, with uniform size to produce 7 -fold expansions with reproducible results.

40|$|Purpose of reviewThis article {{summarizes}} novel {{developments in}} hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) as an organ preservation modality for kidneys recovered from deceased donors. Recent findingsHMP {{has undergone a}} renaissance in recent years. This renewed interest has arisen parallel to a shift in paradigms; not only optimal preservation of an often marginal quality graft is required, but also improved <b>graft</b> function and <b>tools</b> to predict the latter are expected from HMP. The focus of attention in this field is currently drawn {{to the protection of}} endothelial integrity by means of additives to the perfusion solution, improvement of the HMP solution, choice of temperature, duration of perfusion, and machine settings. HMP may offer the opportunity to assess aspects of graft viability before transplantation, which can potentially aid preselection of grafts based on characteristics such as perfusate biomarkers, as well as measurement of machine perfusion dynamics parameters. SummaryHMP has proven to be beneficial as a kidney preservation method for all types of renal grafts, most notably those retrieved from extended criteria donors. Large numbers of variables during HMP, such as duration, machine settings and additives to the perfusion solution are currently being investigated to improve renal function and graft survival.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionEndograft {{infection}} {{has received}} less attention than other complication, so that {{little is known}} about the general features, risk factors, and treatment. The purpose of this short series is to examine our experience of infective complications after EVAR. Material and methodsBetween November 2000 and December 2008, 247 patients underwent endograft repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Follow-up protocol included clinical visit and computed-tomography angiography 1, 4 and 12 months after the intervention, and yearly thereafter. No duplex control was performed on a regular basis. ResultsMedian follow-up was 16 months (range, 3 – 92); two patients (2 / 244, 0. 8 %) developed an endograft infection, 12 and 36 -months after the intervention respectively. On admission, both patients complained septic-like fever and abdominal discomfort; leukocytes-labelled scans did not reveal pathologic traits whereas spiral computed-tomography confirmed the suspicious of endograft infection. They underwent endograft removal and extra-anatomic axillo-bifemoral by-pass; both survived and are still alive 12 and 6 -months after the intervention. Isolated micro-organisms were Candida albicans and Escherichia coli in one patient, and Haemophilus aphrophilus in the other. ConclusionEndograft infection is an uncommon occurrence, Spiral computed-tomography seems to be an essential diagnostic <b>tool.</b> <b>Graft</b> removal was successful in our high-risk patients.

40|$|The botryosphaeriaceous fungi {{can cause}} decline, dieback {{and death of}} grapevines. Anecdotal {{evidence}} has indicated that these pathogens might {{be present in the}} young vines sold by propagation nurseries, so this study investigated their role in spread of this disease. Sampling of grapevine nurseries across New Zealand showed that botryosphaeriaceous infections were present in eight out of nine nurseries with infection incidence ranging from 5 to 63 %. Of the 311 propagation materials and plants received, 23 % were positive for botryosphaeriaceous infection, with a total of 120 isolates recovered. The highest incidence was in failed grafted plants (33 %), followed by Grade 1 plants (28 %), rootstock cuttings (19 %), scion cuttings (17 %) and Grade 2 plants (7 %). For grafted plants, the majority of botryosphaeriaceous species (49 %) were isolated near the graft unions while infections on rootstocks and scion cuttings were mostly from the middle and basal parts. Identification of isolates by morphological and molecular methods showed that the six species commonly found in vineyards also occurred in nurseries, being Neofusicoccum luteum (57 %), N. parvum (18 %), N. australe (8 %), Diplodia mutila (8 %), Botryosphaeria dothidea (5 %) and D. seriata (3 %), with one novel isolate of N. macroclavatum and two unidentified botryosphaeriaceous isolates. Pathogenicity tests using one-year-old Sauvignon blanc rooted canes and green shoots showed that the seven identified botryosphaeriaceous species from the nurseries were pathogenic but pathogenicity differed significantly between species and isolates within a species, with N. parvum being the most pathogenic in both assays (P≤ 0. 001). Genetic variability analysis using UP-PCR showed that N. luteum isolates of different pathotypes were genetically diverse with intra- and inter-plant and nursery variability but no association between genotype and pathogenicity was observed. Susceptibility tests using three isolates each of N. luteum, N. parvum and N. australe against the most commonly used scion and rootstock varieties (six of each) found that all varieties were susceptible to the three species with 5 C and SO 4 being the most susceptible of the rootstock varieties, and Merlot and Pinot noir being the most susceptible of the scions. Investigations into the sources of inoculum conducted in three nurseries in 2009 using conventional and molecular methods showed that the mothervines used to provide cuttings for propagation were the most likely source of botryosphaeriaceous infections. Propagules were detected on the surfaces of cuttings and dead grapevine materials, as well as in rain-water run-off, but not in soil samples collected from the mothervine blocks. The different botryosphaeriaceous isolates recovered from canes were mostly sited within the bark suggesting presence of latent infections. Since the isolates from mothervine trunk and canes were distributed in isolated patches and the UP-PCR assessment showed that they belonged to multiple genotypes and species, this indicated that they were spread from external sources. Microscopy and plating assays were not able to detect botryosphaeriaceous contamination from any of the nursery propagation stages but molecular methods using multi-species primers detected botryosphaeriaceous DNA in samples from a wash pit, pre-cold storage hydration tanks, post-grafting hydration tanks, <b>grafting</b> <b>tools</b> and callusing medium from the different nurseries. An investigation into the probable survival of N. luteum conidia during the processing of cuttings showed that they adhered rapidly and could not be totally washed from the surfaces of cuttings after 0 h, with minimal recovery of conidia after 1, 2 and 4 h incubation at room temperature. During this time they germinated and colonised the periderm, phloem and xylem but not the pith of the cuttings. At storage temperatures of 2 and 8 °C some conidia were able to germinate. At 2 °C, conidial germination was 4 % after 48 h, the number gradually increasing to 17 % after 3 weeks. At 8 °C, conidial germination was 23 % after 24 h, the number gradually increasing to 34 % after 72 h with no further increase observed up to 2 weeks. Cold storage did not kill all conidia, since conidia from 72 h and 3 weeks storage at 2 °C had 84 % and 33 % viability, respectively, while those from 8 °C storage had 72 % and 39 % viability after 72 h and 2 weeks storage, respectively. The N. luteum conidia stored at different temperatures were similarly pathogenic compared to freshly-harvested conidia but higher pathogenicity was observed on conidia stored at 2 °C for 48 to 72 h. Overall results suggest that botryosphaeriaceous infection in new vineyards may originate from latent infection that began in the nurseries, thus management of this disease should start at the nursery level to prevent this pathogen from being carried over into new vineyards...|$|R
40|$|<b>Grafting</b> {{provides}} a <b>tool</b> aimed to increase low-P stress tolerance of crops, however, {{little is known}} about the mechanism (s) by which rootstocks can confer resistance to P deprivation. In this study, 4 contrasting groups of rootstocks from different genetic backgrounds (Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme and introgression and recombinant inbred lines derived from the wild relatives S. pennellii and S. pimpinellifolium) were grafted to a commercial F 1 hybrid scion and cultivated under control (1 mM, c) and P deficient (0. 1 mM, p) conditions for 30 days, to analyze rootstocks-mediated traits that impart low (L, low shoot dry weight, SDW) or high (H, high SDW) vigor. Xylem sap ionic and hormonal anlyses leaf nutritional status suggested that some physiological traits can explain rootstocks impacts on shoot growth. Although xylem P concentration increased with root biomass under both growing conditions, shoot biomass under low-P was explained by neither changes in root growth nor P transport and assimilation. Indeed, decreased root P export only explained the sensitivity of the HcLp rootstocks, while leaf P status was similarly affected in all graft combinations. Interestingly, most of the nutrients analyzed in the xylem sap correlated with root biomass under standard fertilization but only Ca was consistently related to shoot biomass under both control and low-P, suggesting an important role for this nutrient in rootstock-mediated vigor. Moreover, foliar Ca, S, and Mn concentrations were (i) specifically correlated with shoot growth under low-P and (ii) positively and negatively associated to the root-to-shoot transport of the cytokinin trans-zeatin (t-Z) and the ethylene precursor 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC), respectively. Indeed, those hormones seem to play an antagonistic positive (t-Z) and negative (ACC) role in the rootstock-mediated regulation of shoot growth in response to P nutrition. The use of Hp-type rootstocks seems to enhance P use efficiency of a commercial scion variety, therefore could potentially be used for increasing yield and agronomic stability under low P availability.
