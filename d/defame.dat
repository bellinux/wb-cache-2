5|$|Corman had initial {{trouble finding}} {{distribution}} for the film, as some distributors, including American International Pictures (AIP), felt that the film would be interpreted as anti-Semitic, citing the characters of Gravis Mushnick and Siddie Shiva. Welles, who is Jewish, stated that he gave his character a Turkish Jewish accent and mannerisms, and that he saw the humor of the film as playful, and felt there was no intent to <b>defame</b> any ethnic group. The film was finally released by its production company, The Filmgroup, nine months after it had been completed.|$|E
5|$|Darby denied {{involvement}} with the murder, claiming that New Court partisans such as Francis P. Blair and Amos Kendall were seeking to <b>defame</b> him. He also countered that Eliza Sharp's letter to the New Court Argus was written by New Court supporters, including Kendall, the newspaper's editor. The claims and counterclaims {{between the two sides}} reached such an extreme that an 1826 letter in the New Court Argus suggested that New Court supporters had instigated Sharp's murder in order to blame Old Court partisans and affix a stigma to them.|$|E

5|$|Spider-Man 3 {{picks up}} {{one year after}} the events of the second film. Peter is still seeing Mary Jane Watson, while Harry Osborn succeeds his father as the new Green Goblin. Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who like Peter is a {{photographer}} for the Daily Bugle, sets out to <b>defame</b> Spider-Man and incriminate him. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), an escaped convict, falls into a particle accelerator and becomes a shape-shifting sand monster later known as Sandman. Peter later learns that Marko is the one that killed Uncle Ben, causing Peter's own dark intentions to grow. This vendetta is enhanced by the appearance of the mysterious black alien symbiotic substance that bonds to Peter, resulting in the formation of a new black costume. Once Peter separates himself from the alien, it finds a new host in the form of Brock, resulting in the creation of Venom.|$|E
5|$|According to John of Salisbury, {{who first}} {{reported}} {{this story in}} 1172 {{after the death of}} Thomas Becket, as a young clerk Roger was involved in a scandal involving a homosexual relationship with a boy named Walter. After Walter made the relationship public, Roger reacted by embroiling Walter in judicial case that ended with Walter's eyes being gouged out. When Walter then accused Roger of this crime, Roger persuaded a judge to condemn Walter to death by hanging. Becket supposedly was involved in the cover-up afterwards, by arranging with Hilary of Chichester and John of Coutances for Roger to swear an oath that he was innocent. According to John of Salisbury, Roger then went to Rome in 1152 and was cleared of involvement by Pope Eugene III. John of Salisbury further alleges that it was only after bribery that the pope cleared Roger. Frank Barlow, a medieval historian and Becket's biographer, points out in his biography of Becket that while Roger was accused of these crimes, and may even have been guilty of some sort of criminal homosexuality, John of Salisbury's motives for bringing up this story in 1172 were almost certainly to <b>defame</b> Roger. Such a story would naturally have put Roger in the worst possible light.|$|E

25|$|Defamation means {{tarnishing}} {{the reputation}} of someone. It {{is divided into two}} parts, slander and libel. Slander is spoken defamation and libel is defaming somebody through print (or broadcasting). Both share the same features. To <b>defame</b> someone, you must (a) make a factual assertion (b) for which you cannot provide evidence of its truth. Defamation does not affect the voicing of opinions, but comes into the same fields as rights to free speech in the European Convention's Article 10.|$|E

25|$|Politically, however, Giolitti did {{not survive}} the scandal. He had been Finance Minister in the {{government}} that had suppressed the original 1889 report. As Prime Minister he had borrowed from the Banca Romana for governmental purposes in August 1892, had nominated the bank's governor, Tanlongo, to the Senate, and had resisted a parliamentary enquiry, encouraging suspicions that {{he had something to}} hide. Tanlongo and the Banca Romana's tried to <b>defame</b> Giolitti, calculating that a change of government would result in the release of the defendants.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Gravano {{wrote the}} book Underboss with author Peter Maas. In it, Gravano claimed that he became a {{government}} witness after Gotti attempted to <b>defame</b> him at their trial. Gravano finally realized that the Cosa Nostra code of honor was a sham. At this time, Gravano also hired a publicist, despite the fact Gravano complained often about the publicity-seeking Gotti. After the publication of Underboss, several families of Gravano's victims filed a $25 million lawsuit against him. Also in 1997, New York State took legal action to seize Gravano's profits from the book.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Gage {{used every}} {{opportunity}} to <b>defame</b> Rogers, portraying him as an opportunist who had gotten rich on the war only to gamble away his money as a profligate. It {{is difficult to say}} how many of these allegations were true and how much Gage believed them to be true. Gage apparently saw Rogers as of questionable loyalty—certainly he was not loyal to Gage—and therefore he needed watching. Rogers' dealings with the American Indians troubled Gage, as he and many other British officers in America had come to regard the Indians as treacherous vermin.|$|E
5000|$|The offence of lèse majesté {{is found}} in the Criminal Code.

25|$|In 2012, {{the temple}} {{broadcast}} a talk of Luang Por Dhammajayo {{about what happened}} to Steve Jobs after his death. The talk came as a response to a software engineer of Apple who had sent a letter with questions to the abbot. Luang Por Dhammajayo described how Steve Jobs looked like in heaven. He said that Jobs had been reborn as a deva living close to his former offices, {{as a result of the}} karma of having given knowledge to people. The talk was much criticized, and the abbot was accused of pretending to have attained an advanced meditative state and of attempting to outshine other temples. The temple stated that the talk was meant to illustrate the law of karma, not to <b>defame</b> Jobs, nor to fake an advanced state.|$|E
25|$|Characters in {{the book}} also claim that Mary Magdalene was labeled a prostitute by the Church. While Catholic {{tradition}} in the past, in contrast to other Christian traditions, defended these imputations, these claims are now rejected {{by the majority of}} biblical scholars, Catholic and non-Catholic alike, according to Carol Ann Morrow of AmericanCatholic.org. Also, Pope Gregory I's teaching about Mary Magdalene, though popular throughout much of the Church's history, was never formally integrated into Catholic dogma; nor was he speaking ex cathedra at the time, so his speech is not seen as infallible. Whatever weight is given to this tradition, however, {{there is no evidence that}} it was used to <b>defame</b> Mary, who was considered a saint to whose honor churches were built. She is also respected as a witness to Christ's resurrection as written in the Gospels.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, French {{judges were}} given a list by an {{anonymous}} source containing the names of politicians and others who, it was alleged, had deposited kickbacks from a 1991 arms sale to Taiwan into secret accounts at Clearstream, a private bank in Luxembourg. The most prominent name on the list was that of Nicolas Sarkozy, Villepin's rival for power in the UMP. The list was later shown to be fraudulent, a discovery Villepin kept from the public for 15 {{months at a time}} when the two men were vying for party supremacy. Meanwhile, the source of the list was later revealed to be a longtime associate of Villepin's, one Jean-Louis Gergorin, an executive at EADS. Critics claimed that Villepin, perhaps with the support of then-president Jacques Chirac, had tried to <b>defame</b> his rival. Sarkozy, in turn, filed a suit against whoever was behind the creation of the Clearstream list. Villepin was eventually acquitted in 2010 (see Clearstream trial below).|$|E
