50|$|A {{recurring}} theme in The Narrative is the idealization {{of science and}} the forces working in opposition. Smith praises the doctor for his altruistic work and discusses emerging theories {{for the betterment of}} mankind. He hopes for the near <b>eradication</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> and criminal activity through invention and human moralistic evolution over time. This hope, {{from the perspective of a}} plagued man, becomes a continual source of hope.|$|E

Because of the great potential of AI, it is important to research how to reap its benefits while avoiding potential pitfalls.|$|E

5000|$|Overshoot {{can occur}} due to lag effects. Reproduction rates may remain high {{relative}} to the death rate. Entire ecosystems may be severely affected and sometimes reduced to less-complex states due to prolonged overshoot. [...] The <b>eradication</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> can trigger overshoot when a population suddenly exceeds the land's carrying capacity. An example of this occurred on the Horn of Africa when smallpox was eliminated. A region that had supported around 1 million pastoralists for centuries was suddenly expected to support 14 million people. The result was overgrazing, which led to soil erosion.|$|E
50|$|The second chapter {{begins with}} the Doctor, {{discussing}} current medical topics with Smith. Left to his own devices alone again, Smith expresses hopes for Lamarckism: the <b>eradication</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> and eventually of the perfection {{of the human race}} through education and invention. He introduces his neighbors, the Olivers: an old man and his daughter, a painter about the age of thirty. The two have fallen on hard times and Smith secretly commissions Miss Oliver through Mrs. Rundle. Smith debates Roman Catholicism as the Doctor defends Anglican Protestantism upon his return. Afterwards, a veteran known as “the Major” enters with a limp and grey eyes—they converse on the tragedy of war, condemning Imperialism.|$|E
5000|$|The hubs {{are also}} {{responsible}} for effective spreading of material on network. In an analysis of disease spreading or information flow, hubs {{are referred to as}} super-spreaders. Super-spreaders may have a positive impact, such as effective information flow, but also devastating in a case of epidemic spreading such as H1N1 or AIDS. The mathematical models such as model of H1H1 Epidemic prediction [...] may allow us to predict the spread of diseases based on human mobility networks, infectiousness, or social interactions among humans. Hubs are also important in the <b>eradication</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease.</b> In a scale-free network hubs {{are most likely to be}} infected, because of the large number of connections they have. After the hub is infected, it broadcasts the disease to the nodes it is linked to. Therefore, the selective immunization of hubs may be the cost-effective strategy in eradication of spreading disease.|$|E

40|$|Prediction of {{microscopic}} spread of tumor cells is becoming critically {{important in the}} decision making process in planning radiation therapy for cancer.

40|$|BACKGROUND Canal wall {{down and}} canal wall up {{mastoidectomy}} represent two surgical approaches to middle ear cleft pathology.

In terms of <b>eradication</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> and hearing improvement, a prospective analytical study is done on canal wall up and canal wall down techniques in atticoantral type of CSOM. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was carried out at Government ENT Hospital, Visakhapatnam, from June 2016 to June 2017. A total number of 250 patients with atticoantral variety of CSOM were included in the study and subjected to surgical treatment by canal wall up or canal wall down mastoidectomy along with tympanoplasty. RESULTS Results were analysed in terms of condition of cavity, condition of graft and gain in hearing. In patients who underwent canal wall up tympanomastoidectomy, there were 91. 3...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the {{dynamics}} of a reaction-diffusion SIR epidemic model with specific nonlinear incidence rate. The global existence, positivity, and boundedness of solutions for a reaction-diffusion system with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions are proved. The local stability of the disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium is obtained via characteristic equations. By means of Lyapunov functional, the global stability of both equilibria is investigated. More precisely, our results show that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is less than or equal to unity, which leads to the <b>eradication</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> from population. When the basic reproduction number is greater than unity, then disease-free equilibrium becomes unstable and the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable; in this case the disease persists in the population. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate our theoretical results...|$|E

40|$|Development of {{vaccines}} for {{infectious diseases}} {{has come a}} long way with recent advancements in adjuvant developments and discovery of new antigens that are capable of eliciting strong immunological responses for sterile <b>eradication</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease.</b> Tuberculosis (TB) that kills nearly 2 million of the population every year is also one of the highlights of the recent developments. The availability or not of diagnostic methods for infection has implications for the control of the disease by the health systems but is not related to the immune surveillance, a phenomenon derived from the interaction between the bacteria and their host. Here, we will review the immunology of TB and current vaccine candidates for TB. Current strategies of developing new vaccines against TB will also be reviewed in order to further discuss new insights into immunotherapeutic approaches involving adjuvant and antigens combinations that might be of potential for the control of TB...|$|E
40|$|Medical {{systems like}} Ayurveda and Biomedicine are social {{institutions}} {{embedded in the}} heart of numerous societies which bind human groups and assures the continuity and stability of society. Ayurveda, [...] -“the science of life,” “the knowledge of life,”— {{is one of the oldest}} medical system in the world. It also represents some of the South Asian conceptualizations with respect to issues of health and illness and body and “mind”. As in Biomedicine, its Western equivalent, these conceptualizations have a multidimensional and pervasive history that takes place within a social, cultural, political, philosophical and economic context. However Ayurvedic medicine does not make a division between mind and body as in the Western medical system of Biomedicine. This presentation will therfore describe and discuss how Ayurveda represents the body on one hand, and on the other, how this representation addresses some angle related to the sustainability and maintenance of health in the body, rather than simply the <b>eradication</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> in the body...|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} article is to present our experience with two such cases, which were both treated with combined chemotherapy and proton beam radiation therapy. The patients were selected from a retrospective medical record analysis that was conducted of all patients who were diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma of the sinonasal cavity at the Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirmary/Massachusetts General Hospital Cranial Base Center from 2004 to 2008. One of the patients underwent pretreatment endoscopic subtotal resection to facilitate proton beam radiation therapy. Response to treatment was assessed, post-treatment endoscopic biopsies were performed to assure <b>eradication</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease,</b> and treatment complications were recorded. Both patients completed chemotherapy and proton beam radiation therapy without complication. One patient completed treatment in December 2006 and remains disease free.
