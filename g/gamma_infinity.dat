Quadrupole coupling constants P are determined in the 7 F 0 electronic ground state and estimates are {{given for the}} ratios of shielding parameters (1 - <b>gamma</b> <b>infinity)</b> /(1 - sigma 2). Comparison of the two crystals demonstrates the sensitivity of quadrupolar coupling to Sm 2 +-ligand interactions. Anomalously small splittings in BaFCl (mod P mod < 0. 05 MHz) are ascribed to the mutual cancelling of two electric field gradient components (4 f shell and direct crystal field terms) ...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} excess free energy due to phase {{coexistence}} of fluids by Monte Carlo simulations using successive umbrella sampling in finite LxLxL boxes with periodic boundary conditions. Both the vapor-liquid phase coexistence {{of a simple}} Lennard-Jones fluid and the coexistence between A-rich and B-rich phases of a symmetric binary (AB) Lennard-Jones mixture are studied, varying the density rho in the simple fluid or the relative concentration x_A of A in the binary mixture, respectively. The character of phase coexistence changes from a spherical droplet (or bubble) of the minority phase (near the coexistence curve) to a cylindrical droplet (or bubble) and finally (in {{the center of the}} miscibility gap) to a slab-like configuration of two parallel flat interfaces. Extending the analysis of M. Schrader, P. Virnau, and K. Binder [Phys. Rev. E 79, 061104 (2009) ], we extract the surface free energy gamma (R) of both spherical and cylindrical droplets and bubbles in the vapor-liquid case, and present evidence that for R -> Infinity the leading order (Tolman) correction for droplets has sign opposite to the case of bubbles, consistent with the Tolman length being independent on the sign of curvature. For the symmetric binary mixture the expected non-existence of the Tolman length is confirmed. In all cases {and for a range of radii} R relevant for nucleation theory, gamma(R) deviates strongly from <b>gamma</b> (<b>Infinity)</b> which can be accounted for by a term of order gamma(Infinity) /gamma(R) - 1 ~ 1 /R^ 2. Our results for the simple Lennard-Jones fluid are also compared to results from density functional theory and we find qualitative agreement in the behavior of gamma(R) {{as well as in the}} sign and magnitude of the Tolman length.

Raziskali smo čase proženja alarmov na kliničnem monitorju Dräger <b>Infinity</b> <b>Gamma.</b> Za simuliranje hemodinamičnih spremenljivk smo uporabili simulatorja elektrokardiografskih (EKG) ritmov Simulaids in HeartSim 200. V kvantitativni raziskavi smo primerjali aktivacije alarmov v dveh različnih skupinah, poimenovanih kritični alarmi in nekritični alarmi. Omejili smo se na hemodinamične parametre, izmerjene z monitorjem Dräger <b>Infinity</b> <b>Gamma.</b> Ugotovili smo, da se alarmi kritične skupine prožijo v povprečju v 4, 37 ± 0, 16 sekunde, alarmi nekritične skupine pa v 8, 51 ± 0, 92 sekunde. Primerjali smo tudi časovno prožitev alarmov med hitro in počasno ventrikularno tahikardijo (VT fast in VT slow). Alarm pri VT fast se sproži v povprečju v 3, 32 ± 0, 28 sekunde, kar je hitreje kot pa pri VT slow, kjer čas proženja alarma znaša 5, 88 ± 0, 18 sekunde.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{measurements}} of the magnetoresistance {{as a function of}} the angle theta between magnetic field H and the basal plane in YBa 2 CU 3 O 7 /PrBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 superlattices with two different thicknesses of the separator layer (YBCO: PrBCO = 1 : 1 and 1 : 3). The angular dependence of the magnetoresistance for different field intensities can be scaled into a single curve by introducing the reduced field, H(sin 2 theta+gamma- 2 cos 2 theta) 1 / 2, with the anisotropy parameter gamma. In the YBCO/ PrBCO = 1 : 3 superlattice, quite good scaling is achieved with only the perpendicular field component, which implies fully decoupled YBCO layers (<b>gamma</b> = <b>infinity).</b> In the YBCO/PrBCO= 1 : 1 superlattice, however, a finite anisotropy (gamma almost-equal-to 50) is necessary to obtain a convincing scaling. Measurements of the magnetoresistance for different directions between magnetic field and transport current in these superlattices have shown that the resistive transition broadening in the field is independent of the macroscopic Lorentz force. An interpretation of these data based on the two-dimensional fluctuation model is also presented. status: publishe...|$|R

The weak-coupling Poisson-Boltzmann theory, which applies when the coupling constant Gamma is small, is briefly recapitulated (the coupling constant is defined as Gamma = beta e^ 2 where beta is the inverse temperature, and e the counter-ion charge). The opposite strong-coupling limit (<b>Gamma</b> -> <b>infinity)</b> is treated by using a recent method based on an exact expansion around the ground-state Wigner crystal of counter-ions. The weak- and strong-coupling theories are compared at intermediary values of the coupling constant Gamma= 2 gamma (gamma= 1, 2, 3), to exact results derived within a 1 D lattice representation of 2 D Coulomb systems in terms of anti-commuting field variables. The models (density profile, pressure) are solved exactly for any particles numbers N at Gamma= 2 and up to relatively large finite N at Gamma= 4 and 6. For the one-line geometry, the decay of the density profile at asymptotic distance from the line undergoes a fundamental change with respect to the mean-field behavior at Gamma= 6. The like-charge attraction regime, possible in the strong coupling limit but precluded at mean-field level, survives for Gamma= 4 and 6, but disappears at Gamma= 2...|$|R

40|$|The twisted {{geometries}} of spin network {{states are}} described by simple twistors, isomorphic to null twistors with a timelike direction singled out. The isomorphism {{depends on the}} Immirzi parameter gamma and reduces to the identity for <b>gamma</b> = <b>infinity.</b> Using this twistorial representation, we study {{the action of the}} conformal group SU(2, 2) on the classical phase space of loop quantum gravity, described by twisted geometry. The generators of translations and conformal boosts do not preserve the geometric structure, whereas the dilatation generator does. It corresponds to a one-parameter family of embeddings of T*SL(2, C) in twistor space, and its action preserves the intrinsic geometry while changing the extrinsic one-that is the boosts among polyhedra. We discuss the implication of this action from a dynamical point of view and compare it with a discretization of the dilatation generator of the continuum phase space, given by the Lie derivative of the group character. At leading order in the continuum limit, the latter reproduces the same transformation of the extrinsic geometry, while also rescaling the areas and volumes and preserving the angles associated with the intrinsic geometry. Away from the continuum limit, its action has an interesting nonlinear structure but is in general incompatible with the closure constraint needed for the geometric interpretation. As a side result, we compute the precise relation between the extrinsic geometry used in twisted geometries and the one defined in the gauge-invariant parametrization by Dittrich and Ryan and show that the secondary simplicity constraints they posited coincide with those dynamically derived in the toy model of [Classical Quantum Gravity 32, 195015 (2015) ]...|$|R
40|$|Consider a {{two-dimensional}} bubble moving with speed U through an unbounded, inviscid fluid. Let all lengths be normalized by T/ rhoU quot;SUP 2 quot; where T is the surface tension. Then {{the shape of}} the bubble depends on a single parameter GAMMA= 2 DELTAp/ rhoU quot;SUP 2 quot; - 1, where deltap=p quot;SUB bquot; -p quot;SUB infinityquot; is the difference between the bubble pressure and the ambient pressure. We obtain solutions for the bubble shape over the whole range of GAMMA-values that are physically relevant. The formulation involves a mapping from an auxiliary circle plane zeta where the flow field is known. The problem then reduces to solving an infinite set of nonlinear algebraic equations for the coefficients in the mapping function. To a first approximation, when <b>GAMMA</b> right arrow <b>infinity,</b> the bubble takes an elliptical shape of aspect ratio (1 + 2 / 3 GAMMA quot;SUP - 1 quot;) /(1 - 2 / 3 GAMMA quot;SUP - 1 quot;) flattened in the flow direction. The solution correct to order GAMMA quot;SUP - 5 quot; is then obtained which is fairly accurate for GAMMA as low as 2. When GAMMA= 0 the exact, nonlinear solution for the bubble shape is given by x= 1 / 3 (1 / 3 cos phi- 1 / 27 cos 3 phi), y= 1 / 3 (5 / 3 sin phi+ 1 / 27 sin 3 phi). We can then obtain a perturbation solution for GAMMA right arrow 0 correct to order GAMMA quot;SUP 6 quot;. This solution, useful in the range 0. 75 GAMMA- 0. 4537, even gives reasonable descriptions of non-convex bubble shapes for GAMMA 0 down to the pinch-off limit GAMMA * when the bubble ceases to be simply connected. It is remarkable that a simple analytical representation correct to order GAMMA quot;SUP 2 quot; analytically yields a value for GAMMA * of - 0. 4548, i. e. within 0. 3 % of the correct value; naturally, the higher-order approximations are even more accurate. While the present results eliminate the need for direct numerical computations over most of the range of GAMMA, such results, too, are presented. Finally, the dependence of the bubble geometrical parameters, Weber number and added mass on GAMMA is determined. (A...|$|R
40|$|Background Airway {{management}} {{is of utmost}} importance during delivery of general anaesthesia. Traditionally, laryngoscopy and endotracheal tube (ETT) insertion has been the mainstay in providing adequate airway management and delivering anaesthesia. The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) offers a much less invasive way of maintaining the airway as it does not pass through the glottis but is placed over the glottis. It {{does not require the}} use of the laryngoscope. Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation or laryngeal mask airway insertion are noxious stimuli which provoke a transient but marked sympathetic response manifesting as hypertension and tachycardia. In susceptible patients particularly those with systemic hypertension, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and intracranial aneurysm, even these transient changes can result in potentially deleterious effects like left ventricular failure, arrhythmias, myocardial ischaemia, cerebral haemorrhage and rupture of cerebral aneurysm. Objective To determine the haemodynamic response elicited by laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation and compare it with that elicited by laryngeal mask insertion in ASA I and ASA II patients, undergoing elective surgeries at Muhimbili national Hospital (MNH) and Muhimbili Orthopaedic Institute (MOI) in 2011. Methods A hospital based prospective randomized comparative study was conducted to determine the haemodynamic response elicited by laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation and compare it with that elicited by laryngeal mask insertion in ASA I and ASA II patients, undergoing elective surgeries at MNH and MOI. After induction of anaesthesia either an ETT or LMA was inserted. Evaluations included measurement of blood pressure and heart rates before insertion, after insertion of device, 1 minute, 3 minutes and 5 minutes after insertion. Measuments were taken from the Drager <b>infinity</b> <b>gamma</b> XL monitor. Time and ease of insertion was also noted. Results There was an increase in HR, SBP and DBP seen after laryngoscopy and ETT insertion as well as after laryngeal mask insertion. The change in haemodynamic parameters after laryngoscopy and ETT insertion were significantly greater than those elicited by LMA insertion (p< 0. 0001). The increase took about 5 minutes to return to pre insertion values in the ETT group, while it took about 3 minutes for the same values to return to pre insertion values in the LMA group. It took a significantly shorter time to insert an LMA (12. 63 sec) as compared to time taken to insert an ETT (22. 76 sec). Insertion of an LMA was rated easy in 84 % of the patients while it was rated easy in 60 % of the ETT patients. Conclusion The haemodynamic changes elicited by LMA insertion are less and short lived compared to those elicited by laryngoscopy and ETT insertion. It takes a shorter time and is much easier to insert an LMA as compared to laryngoscopy and ETT insertion. These changes might be insignificant in a normotensive patient, but could be harmful in a patient with cerebrovascular or cardiovascular abnormalities. The use of an LMA is recommended in these groups of patients...|$|R
