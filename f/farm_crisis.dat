The Great Depression brought economic tough times to the city. The inclusion of new factories in the 1940s and 1950s helped turn the economy around after World War II. Davenport was on hard times once again with the <b>farm</b> <b>crisis</b> of the 1980s, when the Caterpillar Plant closed, costing 35,000 jobs.

25|$|Hoover {{had taken}} office hoping to raise {{agricultural}} tariffs {{in order to}} help farmers reeling from the <b>farm</b> <b>crisis</b> of the 1920s, but his attempt to raise agricultural tariffs became connected with attempts to raise tariffs for other goods. In June 1930, over the objection of many economists, Congress approved and Hoover reluctantly signed into law the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act. The legislation raised tariffs on thousands of imported items. The intent of the act was to encourage the purchase of American-made products by increasing the cost of imported goods, while raising revenue for the federal government and protecting farmers. However, economic depression had spread worldwide, and Canada, France and other nations retaliated by raising tariffs on imports from the U.S. The result was to contract international trade, and worsen the Depression. Progressive Republicans such as Senator Borah were outraged when Hoover signed the bill, and Hoover's relations with that wing of the party never recovered.|$|E
25|$|Although Native Americans in the United States have {{resided in}} what is now Iowa for 13,000 years, the written history of Iowa begins with the proto-historic {{accounts}} of Native Americans by explorers such as Marquette and Joliet in the 1680s. Until the early 19th century Iowa was occupied exclusively by Indians and a few European traders, with loose political control by France and Spain. Iowa became part of the United States of America after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, but uncontested U.S. control over what is now Iowa occurred only after the War of 1812 and after a series of treaties eliminated Indian claims on the state. Beginning in the 1830s Euro-American settlements appeared in the Iowa Territory, U.S. statehood was acquired in 1846, and by 1860 almost the entire state was settled and farmed by Euro-Americans. Subsistence frontier farming was replaced by commodity farming after the construction of railroad networks in the 1850s and 1860s. Iowa contributed a disproportionate amount of young men to fight in the American Civil War. Afterwards they returned to help transform Iowa into an agricultural powerhouse, supplying food {{to the rest of the}} nation. The industrialization of agriculture and the emergence of centralized commodities markets in the late 19th and 20th centuries led to a shift towards larger farms and the decline of the small family farm; this was exacerbated during the Great Depression. Industrial production became a larger part of the economy during World War II and the postwar economic boom. In the 1970s and 1980s a series of economic shocks, including the oil crisis, the 1980s <b>farm</b> <b>crisis,</b> and the Early 1980s recession led to the collapse of commodities prices, a decline in rural and state population, and rural flight. Iowa's economy rebounded in the 1990s, emerging as a modern mixed economy dominated by industry, commerce, and finance, in which agriculture is a comparatively small component. Iowa's population is now predominately urban and has been increasing since the 1990s at a faster rate than the U.S. as a whole, although rural flight continues to be a problem.|$|E
500|$|But by {{the late}} 1970s the good times were over for both {{downtown}} and local businesses and industries.

Restructuring of heavy industry also continued: the Caterpillar plant on the city's north side closed, causing another wave of job loss.|$|E
50|$|Lounsberry was {{appointed}} Iowa Secretary of Agriculture in 1972, and was re-elected in 1974, 1978, 1982 and served until retiring on January 3, 1987. In 1978, {{he was elected}} by the largest margin in Iowa history for a statewide office. He was at the helm during <b>farm</b> <b>crises</b> of the 1980s and testified several times before the U.S. House and Senate and was a leading force in Federal farm bankruptcy laws passed during that time.

40|$|In {{considering}} {{the role of}} religious assumptions in making environmental decisions in agriculture, the idea of sabbath is proposed as offering a radical critique of the present agricultural situation and a robust, holistic basis for agricultural ethics.

In the current <b>farming</b> <b>crisis,</b> the sabbath urges us to recgonise and respect both people and the earth, to subordinate the pursuite of private wealth to meeting the needs of the poor and vulnerable, and to restrain the concentration of power and control...|$|R

2500|$|Upon taking office, Roosevelt {{proposed}} {{the construction of}} a series of hydroelectric power plants and sought to address the ongoing <b>farm</b> <b>crisis</b> of the 1920s. Relations between Roosevelt and Smith suffered after Roosevelt chose not to retain key Smith appointees like Robert Moses. Roosevelt and Eleanor established a political understanding that would last for the duration of his political career; she would dutifully serve as the governor's wife but was also be free to pursue her own agenda and interests. He also began holding [...] "fireside chats", in which he directly addressed his constituents via the radio, often using these chats to pressure the New York State Legislature to advance his agenda. Months into his tenure, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 occurred, and the country began sliding into the Great Depression. While President Hoover and many state governors believed that the economic crisis would subside, Roosevelt saw the seriousness of the situation and established a state employment commission. He also became the first governor to publicly endorse the idea of unemployment insurance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. This data collection consists of life stories, individual interview transcripts and one focus group. Recent ‘food scares’ and <b>farming</b> <b>crises</b> {{have led to}} declining consumer confidence in food safety. Focusing on two commodities, chicken and sugar, this project has investigated the social, political and technological changes that have transformed the British food industry within living memory. It uses a life-history approach (supplemented by interviews with policy-makers and consumer focus groups), recording the personal testimony of people involved at every point along the supply chain ‘from farm to fork’. Faced {{with the need to}} restore consumer trust, we argue that food producers are involved in managing the shifting cultural meanings of food as much as they are concerned with the commercial imperatives of technological change, product innovation and profitability. Questions of memory and tradition, gender and generation, authenticity and provenance (referred to here as the process of ‘manufacturing meaning’) are therefore assuming greater economic significance for the retail trade...|$|R
