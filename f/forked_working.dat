40|$|All the preamplifiers {{dedicated}} for Quartz Enhanced PhotoAcoustic Spectroscopy (QEPAS) {{applications that}} {{have so far}} {{been reported in the}} literature have been based on operational amplifiers working in transimpedance configurations. Taking into consideration that QEPAS sensors are based on quartz tuning forks, and that quartz has a relatively high voltage constant and relatively low charge constant, it seems that a transimpedance amplifier is not an optimal solution. This paper describes the design of a quartz QEPAS sensor preamplifier, implemented with voltage amplifier configuration. Discussion of an electrical model of the circuit and preliminary measurements are presented. Both theoretical analysis and experiments show that use of the voltage configuration allows for a substantial increase of the output signal in comparison to the transimpedance circuit with the same tuning <b>fork</b> <b>working</b> in identical conditions. Assuming that the sensitivity of the QEPAS technique depends directly on the properties of the preamplifier, use of the voltage amplifier configuration should result in an increase of QEPAS sensitivity by one to two orders of magnitude...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a localization system for mobile robots that {{are able to}} navigate autonomously in industrial environments like factory and exhibition halls. Previous approaches show that ceiling structures like beams, pipes and lighting installation are wellsuited for self-localization in large halls. With this paper we describe how to use ceiling structures, measured with a 3 D laser range sensor, as natural landmarks. Due to the novel relative representation of 3 D ceiling features this method {{can be used in a}} wide range of industrial halls with sloped, stepped and even curved ceiling structures. In addition to this new algorithm the paper presents experimental results with an autonomous <b>fork</b> lift <b>working</b> without the need for artificial landmarks or extra infrastructure. 1...|$|R
40|$|Natural history {{collections}} house immense {{amounts of}} data, {{but the majority}} of data is only accessible by locating the collection label, which is usually attached to the physical specimen. This method of data retrieval is time consuming and can be very damaging to fragile specimens. Digitizing the collections is the one way to reduce the time and potential damage related to finding the collection objects. The Elm Fork Natural Heritage Museum is a natural history museum located at the University of North Texas and contains collections of both vertebrate and invertebrate taxa, as well as plants. This project designed a collection digitization workflow for Elm <b>Fork</b> by <b>working</b> through digitizing the Benjamin B. Harris Herbarium. The collection was cataloged in Specify 6, a database program designed for natural history collection management. By working through one of the museum’s collections, the project was able to identify and address challenges related to digitizing the museum’s holdings in order to create robust workflows. The project also produced a series of documents explaining common processes in Specify and a data management plan...|$|R
5000|$|As of April 28, 2013, the originator's direct {{development}} has ceased.After this project development ceased by the originator - Fragadelic, {{a group of}} developers {{who are members of}} Copper Linux User Group in Arizona, began Respin. This development (project [...] "fork") was in transition to new supporters. The original code was received by the originator and the team members discussed the fork with him. This <b>fork</b> released a <b>working</b> version late July 2015. In early October 2015, the Debian Principal Developer, reverted to maintaining Remastersys, but kept Linux Respin open as a project for future features and development. Both the Ubuntu developer/maintainer, Sergio Mejia, and the Debian developer/maintainer, Marcia Wilbur, keep respin available on github and launchpad respectively.|$|R
50|$|In 1919, British {{inventor}} Cyril Pullin and Stanley L. Groom {{produced the}} Pullin motor bicycle, a wheeled machine {{that included a}} novel two-stroke engine and extensive manufacture use of steel pressings that anticipated developments by British motorcycle manufacturer Ariel Motorcycles in the late 1950s and Japanese motorcycle manufacturers in 1960s. The bicycle was patented in 1920. Since 1920, Pullin had been working with Stanley Groom to develop and patent a two-stroke motorcycle with a unique design of pressed sheet metal frame and <b>forks.</b> After <b>working</b> {{on a range of}} other inventions including the Ascot car, Pullin teamed up with Groom again to further develop their ideas and patent the Ascot Pullin motorcycle, with a four-stroke rather than two-cycle engine. At a time when manufacturers were taking a very traditional approach to motorcycle design with conventional frames and engine layout, Pullin and Grom were keen to create an enclosed feel by mounting the engine horizontally within a pressed-steel frame. As well as the hydraulic brakes, Pullin also designed a telescopic centre stand and an adjustable windshield, complete with a windscreen wiper and rear-view mirror, as well as a fully enclosed chain and interchangeable wheels.|$|R

Conductive tips with a radius smaller than 10 nm were routinely produced as shown by field emission measurements through FowlereNordheim plots. These etched tips were then fixed on a quartz tuning <b>fork</b> force sensor <b>working</b> in a qPlus configuration to check their performances for both scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. Their sharpness and conductivity are evidenced by the resolution achieved in STM and AFM images obtained of epitaxial graphene on 6 H-SiC(0001) surface. The structure of an epitaxial graphene layer thermally grown on the 6 H-SiC(0001) (6 R 3 x 6 R 3) R 30 ° reconstructed surface, was successfully imaged at room temperature with STM, dynamic STM and by frequency modulated AFM...|$|R
60|$|It was a {{numerous}} company--eighteen {{or twenty}} perhaps. Of these some {{five or six}} were ladies, who sat wedged together in a little phalanx by themselves. All the knives and <b>forks</b> were <b>working</b> away {{at a rate that}} was quite alarming; very few words were spoken; and everybody seemed to eat his utmost in self-defence, as if a famine were expected to set in before breakfast time to-morrow morning, and it had become high time to assert the first law of nature. The poultry, which may perhaps be considered to have formed the staple of the entertainment--for there was a turkey at the top, a pair of ducks at the bottom, and two fowls in the middle--disappeared as rapidly as if every bird had had the use of its wings, and had flown in desperation down a human throat. The oysters, stewed and pickled, leaped from their capacious reservoirs, and slid by scores into the mouths of the assembly. The sharpest pickles vanished, whole cucumbers at once, like sugar-plums, and no man winked his eye. Great heaps of indigestible matter melted away as ice before the sun. It was a solemn and an awful thing to see. Dyspeptic individuals bolted their food in wedges; feeding, not themselves, but broods of nightmares, who were continually standing at livery within them. Spare men, with lank and rigid cheeks, came out unsatisfied from the destruction of heavy dishes, and glared with watchful eyes upon the pastry. What Mrs Pawkins felt each day at dinner-time is hidden from all human knowledge. But she had one comfort. It was very soon over.|$|R
