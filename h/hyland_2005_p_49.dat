3000|$|Nonetheless, {{it appears}} {{dialogic}} expansion {{is an important}} part of academic writing, since expansion acknowledges other possibilities and findings. However, novice writers have been found to approach the topic of an argument as if their opinion were the sole (correct) one, resulting in a “constriction of negotiation of space” (Mei & Allison, 2005). In the act of forming an argument in an academic text, student writers need to be able to identify their position on a topic as part of an established discussion. Considerations must be made as to whom they are writing as well as how others’ findings and ideas relate to their argument. There are many ways to do this and it is a complex web of linguistic and rhetorical moves to indicate attitude to a reader about a topic and other people’s thoughts. Across genres, a published academic text [...] "display[s] the writer's awareness of both its readers and its consequences" [...] (<b>Hyland,</b> <b>2005,</b> <b>p.</b> 5). In this sense, a writer is recognizing the addressivity in writing, where an author considers whom s/he is responding to or addressing (Bakhtin, 1986). At the same time, writers must ensure that their [...] "voice is not lost, though the diversity of opinions is acknowledged" [...] (Mei & Allison, <b>2005,</b> <b>p.</b> 115).|$|R

30|$|Innovations play a {{major role}} not only in formulating {{national}} and international economic policies but also in devising strategies for achieving sustainable development (Rennings 2000). While the concept of invention refers to a discovery, the majority of innovations are not based on discovery but are the outcome of applied research and development (Kemp and Pearson 2008). Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (2005) suggests four types of innovations: product innovations, process innovations, organisational innovations and marketing innovations. This paper focuses on process innovation within the broad definition of innovation. According to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (2005), process innovation is “the implementation of a new or significantly improved production or delivery method” (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) <b>2005,</b> <b>p.</b> <b>49).</b> Process innovations include significant changes in techniques, equipment and/or software by reducing unit costs (Kammerer 2009; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 2005; Rennings 2000) and/or improving quality (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 2005). Hence the focus is on improving the existing processes or adding new processes (Carrillo-Hermosilla et al. 2010). Despite the usefulness of this general categorization (Carrillo-Hermosilla et al. 2010), OECD categories are not sufficient for dealing with the issues of sustainable development since they do not distinguish between environmental and non-environmental innovations (Rennings 2000).|$|R

30|$|Capacity {{building}} {{to work with}} women is an essential consideration to facilitate care and support for women survivors in disasters. PSS modules have specifically focused training manuals, sessions on vulnerable populations like children, women, disabled persons, and so on (Sekar et al. 2004). The term psychosocial refers to the dynamic relationship between the psychological and social dimensions of a person, where the one influences the other. The psychological dimension includes the internal, emotional, and thought processes of a person—his or her feelings and reactions. The social dimension includes relationships, family and community networks, social values, and cultural practices (Hansen 2008). Within the PSS program portfolio women {{are one of the}} target groups given special consideration to help them to deal with their vulnerabilities. In India, PSS for disaster survivors is mainly offered by the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), an agency that works in disaster response (NIMHANS and WHO 2006) and propagated the PSS program module (Murthy et al. 1987; Murthy 2000) starting in 1990. The module emphasizes the need of developing a holistic model of recovery for the rehabilitation of disaster survivors. This concept of a so-called “umbrella of care” will focus on developing and mobilizing various types of support (livelihood, microfinance, housing, water and sanitation, paralegal, self-help group initiatives, and so on) (Sekar et al. <b>2005,</b> <b>p.</b> <b>49).</b> This holistic service module is being developed and implemented in various disaster interventions in India for the rehabilitation of women survivors. Thus, psychosocial support is often provided in combination with other support in coordination with various humanitarian organizations working in a disaster-affected area. The basic purpose of psychosocial support is to ensure normalcy by reducing stress reactions, enhancing positive coping, rebuilding and strengthening social support mechanisms, mobilizing the local community to own the process of recovery as a stakeholder, and working at the individual, family, and community levels.|$|R
30|$|In {{the shift}} from rice {{cultivation}} to shrimp farming, unequal access to shrimp farming can be analyzed through the fact that farmers are not always free decision makers. In the decision-making process to raise shrimp, farmers play both an active and passive role. The phenomenon that all farmers in coastal areas are shrimp producers may imply that shrimp farming is an equal access opportunity to all local people. However, this study shows that although the potential to earn a high profit is a decisive factor to urge a majority of people to shift actively into shrimp farming, farmers are not always free-decision makers in this process. Some households were reluctant to shift to shrimp farming {{because they did not}} want to take on the risks involved with shrimp farming. Some of them were already living at the subsistence margin. Those reluctant to take on shrimp farming engaged in shrimp farming because they did not have any other alternative because, with the shift to shrimp farming, the irrigation system has favored saline water. They could not grow rice, the traditional crop from which they already had a stable income, while their neighbors were raising shrimp. Saline water intrusion from neighboring shrimp ponds was a standing danger for their rice crops. Results from the survey on structural transformation of agriculture-forestry-fisheries in the 1999 – 2005 period conducted by the Ca Mau People’s Committee confirm this phenomenon. This report shows that in Cai Nuoc district of Ca Mau province, among the reasons for converting from rice to shrimp, aside from the reason to improve households’ economic conditions, residing on planned areas for shrimp farming was also an important reason, accounting for 43 % of the surveyed households (Ca Mau’s People Committee <b>2005,</b> <b>p.</b> <b>49).</b> Having other sources of income and the possibility of mobilizing social capital embedded in various social organizations in terms of financial capital, labor, and land helps poor farmers to participate in shrimp farming.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{academic}} discourse {{has been}} reported to be persuasive (e. g. Bhatia, 2004). Writers endeavour to represent themselves in a credible way to get their research accepted by the international academia. Metadiscourse is the linguistic system that enables writers to get positive evaluation of their studies and negative evaluation of previous ones (e. g., <b>Hyland,</b> <b>2005).</b> Little research has investigated the extent to which EFL subject specialists are aware of the interactional function of metadiscourse when reading field-related materials. This study attempted to fill this gap. Fifty EFL geography researchers were asked to read 4 field-related research articles (RAs) and to perform an oral protocol for each. They also responded to language proficiency test, subject background quizzes and a post-reading questionnaire. The protocols were coded in terms of evaluative metadiscourse based on <b>Hyland's</b> (<b>2005)</b> taxonomy. Results showed that language proficiency was the main blocking factor confirming the linguistic threshold hypothesis (Cummins, 1979). The findings have important implications on how metadiscourse might improve field-related RA comprehension in English...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>p</b> <b>49</b> /STRAP (or SRFBP 1) protein was {{recently}} identified in our laboratory as a cofactor of serum response factor {{that contributes to}} the regulation of SRF target genes in the heart. Results In the present study, we report that NDUFAB 1, a nuclear encoded subunit of NADH dehydrogenase, represented the majority of the cDNA clones that interacted with <b>p</b> <b>49</b> /STRAP in multiple screenings using the yeast two-hybrid system. The <b>p</b> <b>49</b> /STRAP and NDUFAB 1 proteins interacted and co-localized with each other in the cell. The <b>p</b> <b>49</b> /STRAP protein contains four classic nuclear localization sequence motifs, and it was observed to be present predominantly in the nucleus. Overexpression of <b>p</b> <b>49</b> /STRAP altered the intracellular level of NAD, and reduced the NAD/NADH ratio.

40|$|Expression of the small-subunit <b>p</b> <b>49</b> mRNA of primase, {{the enzyme}} that synthesizes oligoribonucleotides for {{initiation}} of DNA replication, was examined in mouse cells stimulated to proliferate by serum and in growing cells. The level of <b>p</b> <b>49</b> mRNA increased approximately 10 -fold after serum stimulation and preceded synthesis of DNA and histone H 3 mRNA by several hours. Expression of <b>p</b> <b>49</b> mRNA was not sensitive to inhibition by low concentrations of cycloheximide, which {{suggested that the}} increase in mRNA occurred before the restriction point control for cell cycle progression described for mammalian cells and was not under its control. <b>p</b> <b>49</b> mRNA levels were not coupled to DNA synthesis, as observed for the replication-dependent histone genes, since hydroxyurea or aphidicolin had no effect on <b>p</b> <b>49</b> mRNA levels when added before or during S phase. These inhibitors did have an effect, however, on the stability of <b>p</b> <b>49</b> mRNA and increased the half-life from 3. 5 h to about 20 h, which suggested an interdependence of <b>p</b> <b>49</b> mRNA degradation and DNA synthesis.

This was also observed when elutriated G 1 cells were allowed to continue growth and then were blocked in M phase with colcemid. Only a small decrease in <b>p</b> <b>49</b> mRNA occurred, whereas H 3 mRNA rapidly decreased, when cells entered G 2 /M.

40|$|Baculoviruses induce {{widespread}} apoptosis in invertebrates. To {{better understand}} the pathways by which these DNA viruses trigger apoptosis, {{we have used a}} combination of RNA silencing and overexpression of viral and host apoptotic regulators to identify cell death components in the model system of Drosophila melanogaster. Here we report that the principal effector caspase DrICE is required for baculovirus-induced apoptosis of Drosophila DL- 1 cells as demonstrated by RNA silencing. proDrICE was proteolytically cleaved and activated during infection. Activation was blocked by overexpression of the cellular inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins DIAP 1 and SfIAP but not by the baculovirus caspase inhibitor <b>P</b> <b>49</b> or <b>P</b> 35. Rather, the substrate inhibitors <b>P</b> <b>49</b> and <b>P</b> 35 prevented virus-induced apoptosis by arresting active DrICE through formation of stable inhibitory complexes. Consistent with a two-step activation mechanism, proDrICE was cleaved at the large/small subunit junction TETD 230 -G by a DIAP 1 -inhibitable, <b>P</b> <b>49</b> /P 35 -resistant protease and then at the prodomain junction DHTD 28 -A by a <b>P</b> <b>49</b> /P 35 -sensitive protease. Confirming that <b>P</b> <b>49</b> targeted DrICE and not the initiator caspase DRONC, depletion of DrICE by RNA silencing suppressed virus-induced cleavage of <b>P</b> <b>49.</b> Collectively, our findings indicate that whereas DIAP 1 functions upstream to block DrICE activation, <b>P</b> <b>49</b> and <b>P</b> 35 act downstream by inhibiting active DrICE. Given that <b>P</b> <b>49</b> has the potential to inhibit both upstream initiator caspases and downstream effector caspases, we conclude that <b>P</b> <b>49</b> is a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor that likely provides a selective advantage to baculoviruses in different cellular backgrounds...|$|R
40|$|Inducible {{expression}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) is regulated by a cellular transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). NF-kappa B is composed of distinct subunits; five independent genes, NFKB 1 (p 105), NFKB 2 (p 100), RelA(p 65), c-rel and relB, that encode related proteins that bind to kappa B DNA elements have been isolated. We have previously found that NFKB 2 (<b>p</b> <b>49</b> /p 52) acts in concert with RelA(p 65) to stimulate the HIV enhancer in Jurkat T-leukemia cells. Here we examine the biochemical basis for the transcriptional regulation of HIV by NFKB 2. Using Scatchard analysis, we have determined the dissociation constants of homodimeric <b>p</b> <b>49</b> and heterodimeric <b>p</b> <b>49</b> /p 65 for binding to the HIV kappa B site. <b>p</b> <b>49</b> has a approximately 18 -fold-lower affinity for the HIV kappa B site (KD = 69. 1 pM) than does the approximately 50 -kDa protein NFKB 1 (p 50) derived from p 105 (KD = 3. 9 pM). In contrast, the affinity of heterodimeric NFKB 2 (<b>p</b> <b>49)</b> /RelA(p 65) for this site is approximately 6 -fold higher (KD = 11. 8 pM) than that of <b>p</b> <b>49</b> alone. Consistent with these findings, in vitro transcription was stimulated 18 -fold {{by the addition of}} preformed, heterodimeric NFKB 2 (<b>p</b> <b>49)</b> /RelA(p 65) protein. Transcriptional activation of the HIV enhancer was also subject to regulation by recently cloned I kappa B-alpha(MAD- 3). Recombinant I kappa B-alpha(MAD- 3) inhibited the DNA binding activity of <b>p</b> 65, <b>p</b> <b>49</b> /p 65, and p 50 /p 65 but stimulated the binding of NFKB 2 (<b>p</b> <b>49)</b> or NFKB 1 (p 50). Functional activation of an HIV reporter plasmid by <b>p</b> <b>49</b> /p 65 in transiently transfected Jurkat T-leukemia cells was also inhibited by co{{expression of}} MAD- 3. These data suggest that binding of the NFKB 2 subunit to the HIV enhancer is facilitated by RelA(p 65) and that this NFKB 2 (<b>p</b> <b>49)</b> /p 65 heterodimeric complex mediates transcriptional activation which is subject to regulation by MAD- 3...|$|R
40|$|Caspases play a {{critical}} role in the execution of metazoan apoptosis and are thus attractive therapeutic targets for apoptosis-associated diseases. Here we report that baculovirus <b>P</b> <b>49,</b> a homolog of pancaspase inhibitor P 35, prevents apoptosis in invertebrates by inhibiting an initiator caspase that is P 35 insensitive. Consequently <b>P</b> <b>49</b> blocked proteolytic activation of effector caspases at a unique step upstream from that affected by P 35 but downstream from inhibitor of apoptosis Op-IAP. Like <b>P</b> 35, <b>P</b> <b>49</b> was cleaved by and stably associated with its caspase target. Ectopically expressed <b>P</b> <b>49</b> blocked apoptosis in cultured cells from a phylogenetically distinct organism, Drosophila melanogaster. Furthermore, <b>P</b> <b>49</b> inhibited human caspase- 9, demonstrating its capacity to affect a vertebrate initiator caspase. Thus, <b>P</b> <b>49</b> is a substrate inhibitor with a novel in vivo specificity for a P 35 -insensitive initiator caspase that functions at an evolutionarily conserved step in the caspase cascade.

40|$|Baculovirus {{proteins}} <b>P</b> <b>49</b> and <b>P</b> 35 are potent suppressors of apoptosis {{in diverse}} organisms.

The molecular {{basis of this}} novel caspase specificity is unknown. To advance strategies for selective inhibition of the cell death caspases, we investigated biochemical differences between these baculovirus substrate inhibitors. We report here that <b>P</b> <b>49</b> and <b>P</b> 35 use similar mechanisms for stoichiometric inhibition that require caspase cleavage of their reactive site loops (RSL) and chemical contributions of a conserved N-terminal cysteine to stabilize the resulting inhibitory complex. Our data indicated that <b>P</b> <b>49</b> functions as a homodimer that simultaneously binds two caspases. In contrast, P 35 is a monomeric, monovalent inhibitor. <b>P</b> <b>49</b> and <b>P</b> 35 also differ in their RSL caspase recognition sequences. We tested {{the role of the}} P 4 -P 1 recognition motif for caspase specificity by monitoring virus-induced proteolytic processing of Sf-caspase- 1, the principal effector caspase of the host insect Spodoptera frugiperda. When <b>P</b> <b>49</b> 's TVTD recognition motif was replaced with P 35 's DQMD motif, <b>P</b> <b>49</b> was impaired for inhibition of the initiator caspase that cleaves and activates pro-Sf-caspase- 1 and instead formed a stable inhibitory complex with active Sf-caspase- 1. In contrast, the effector caspase specificity of P 35 was unaltered when P 35 's DQMD motif was replaced with TVTD. We concluded that the TVTD recognition motif is required but not sufficient for initiator caspase inhibition by <b>P</b> <b>49.</b> Our findings demonstrate a critical role for the P 4 -P 1 recognition site in caspase specificity by <b>P</b> <b>49</b> and <b>P</b> 35 and indicate that additional determinants are involved in target selection...|$|R

40|$|The nuclear {{factor that}} binds to the kappa light-chain {{enhancer}} of B cells (NF-kappa B) is a transcription factor that regulates {{the expression of}} a variety of cellular and viral genes. NF-kappa B is composed of distinct subunits, and at least four independent genes (p 105, p 100, p 65, and c-rel) have been isolated that encode related proteins that bind kappa B sites. Because it is possible that specific interactions of different subunits can allow selective gene activation, we have characterized the specificity of transcriptional activation by various combinations of these subunits. When tested alone, an approximately <b>49</b> -kDa form (<b>p</b> <b>49)</b> of the <b>p</b> 100 protein bound weakly to kappa B, but <b>p</b> <b>49</b> associated with <b>p</b> 65 to bind efficiently to this site.
