5|$|The {{history of}} vigilante <b>justice</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Montana Vigilantes began in 1863 {{in what was}} at the time a remote part of eastern Idaho Territory. Vigilante {{activities}} continued, although somewhat sporadically, through the Montana Territorial period until the territory became the state of Montana on November 8, 1889. Vigilantism arose because territorial law enforcement and the courts had very little power in the remote mining camps during the territorial period.|$|E

5|$|A carving {{at the top}} of the stele portrays Hammurabi {{receiving}} the laws from Shamash, the Babylonian god of <b>justice,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> preface states that Hammurabi was chosen by Shamash to bring the laws to them. Parallels between this narrative and the giving of laws by God in Jewish tradition to Moses and similarities between the two legal codes suggest a common ancestor in the Semitic background of the two. Fragments of previous law codes have been found. However David P. Wright argues that the Covenant Code of the Biblical Book of Exodus is 'directly, primarily, and throughout' based upon the Laws of Hammurabi.|$|E
5|$|Alternate {{designs for}} the {{standard}} Batmobile include ones based on the 1960s TV series; a prototype version; 1970s Batman-themed; Robin-themed; Riddler-themed; and Rocksteady-themed. All-new, drivable Batmobiles include: the 1989 film, Tumbler, 1960s TV series, Batman v Superman: Dawn of <b>Justice,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> original Arkham Asylum Batmobiles. These Batmobiles do not feature a tank mode and can only {{be used in the}} main game after all tanks have been eliminated or on specific Batmobile challenge maps. In terms of design, the 1989 film and 1960 TV series ones are longer and narrower with better handling than the standard Arkham Knight Batmobile. Racetracks for the Batmobile include two based on Batman and Batman Returns; two based on The Dark Knight; two based on the 1960s TV series; and two WayneTech tracks.|$|E

5|$|Australind Bypass {{was opened}} on 16 December 1988 by Federal Transport Minister Bob Brown, who helped {{complete}} the final seal, {{together with the}} Mayor of Bunbury Ern Manea. State Transport Minister Bob Pearce planted a roadside tree to commemorate {{the opening of the}} bypass, which was also attended by the Commissioner of Main Roads Albert Tognolini, and Mitchell MLA David Smith, Minister for Community Service, <b>Justice</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> South West. Vintage cars led a procession from the on-site opening ceremony to a reception held in Bunbury. The new road was designed to be easily made into a dual carriageway when required; this was completed nine years later, with the Australind Bypass duplication project officially opened by Mitchell MLA Dan Sullivan on 18 December 1997.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 18th {{to the early}} 19th century, the {{building}} was also known {{by a number of}} names, including the Palazzo del Tribunale, the Palais de <b>Justice</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Gran Corte della Valletta. By the mid-19th century the building was deemed too small, and the courts were gradually moved to Auberge d'Auvergne between 1840 and 1853. The Castellania was then abandoned, before being briefly converted into an exhibition centre, a tenant house and a school.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 the Treaties of Rome {{established}} two, similar, communities {{creating a}} common market (European Economic Community) and promoting atomic energy co-operation (Euratom). The three institutions shared the Court of <b>Justice</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Parliament, however {{they had a}} separate Council and High Authority, which was called the Commission in these Communities. The {{reason for this is}} the different relationship between the Commission and Council. At the time the French government was suspicious of the supranationalism and wanted to limit the powers of the High Authority in the new Communities, giving the Council a greater role in checking the executive.|$|E

5|$|In January 1971, the Superior Courts of <b>Justice</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> School of Arts vacated the {{building}} after {{moving into a}} new courthouse which had been built {{on the site of}} Auberge d'Auvergne. The building was to be converted into an examination hall, but in August of that year, it was assigned to the Posts and Telephones Department. After extensive renovations, the auberge opened as the General Post Office on 4 July 1973, taking over the role from Palazzo Parisio. The auberge remained the GPO until Posta Limited opened a new complex at Marsa in October 1997. The auberge was also used by the Water and Electricity Department, the Agricultural Department and the Central Office of Statistics.|$|E
5|$|Jurisdiction over {{charitable}} disputes {{is shared}} equally between the High Court of <b>Justice</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Charity Commission. The Commission, the first port of call, is tasked with regulating and promoting charitable trusts, {{as well as}} providing advice and opinions to trustees on administrative matters. Where the Commission feels there has been mismanagement or maladministration, it can sanction the trustees, removing them, appointing new ones or temporarily taking the trust property itself to prevent harm being done. Where there are flaws with a charity, the High Court can administer schemes directing the function of the charity, or even, under the Cy-près doctrine, change the purpose of the charity or gift altogether.|$|E

It establishes that Norwegian criminal law, private law and procedural law applies to the territory, in addition to other laws that explicitly state they are valid in the territory. Furthermore, it establishes that all the land belongs to the state, and prohibits both nuclear detonations and the storage of nuclear waste.|$|E
