5|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve his chronic ill health, Darwin went in 1849 to Dr. James Gully's Malvern spa and was {{surprised}} to find some benefit from <b>hydrotherapy.</b> Then, in 1851, his treasured daughter Annie fell ill, reawakening his fears that his illness might be hereditary, and after a long series of crises she died.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Sadler began giving {{lectures on}} the Chautauqua adult-education circuit, which {{featured}} itinerant speakers discussing self-help and morality. Sadler often spoke about attaining {{physical and mental}} health without drugs. He also promoted <b>hydrotherapy</b> and discussed moral issues that related to men. Sadler, his wife, her sister, and a friend, formed a four-member lecture company that gave two- or three-day engagements, sometimes accompanied by an orchestra. Newspapers published favorable reviews of the productions. The lectures proved to be a lucrative endeavor: it was rumored that {{he became one of the}} best-paid Chautauqua speakers.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that Bronze Age people had settled {{in the area around}} 1000 BC, although it is not known whether these settlements were permanent or temporary. The town itself was founded in the 11th century when Benedictine monks established a priory {{at the foot of the}} highest peak of Malvern Hills. During the 19th century Malvern developed rapidly from a village to a sprawling conurbation owing to its popularity as a <b>hydrotherapy</b> spa based on its spring waters. Immediately following the decline of spa tourism towards the end of the 19th century, the town's focus shifted to education with the establishment of several private boarding schools in former hotels and large villas. A further major expansion was the result of the relocation of the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) to Malvern in 1942. QinetiQ, TRE's successor company, remains the town's largest local employer.|$|E
5|$|Bottling and {{shipping}} of the Malvern water grew in volume. In 1842, Dr. James Wilson and Dr. James Manby Gully, leading exponents of <b>hydrotherapy,</b> set up clinics in Malvern (Holyrood House {{for women and}} Tudor House for men). Malvern expanded rapidly as a residential spa. Several large hotels {{and many of the}} large villas in Malvern date from its heyday. Many smaller hotels and guest houses were built between about 1842 and 1875. By 1855 there were already 95hotels and boarding houses and by 1865 over a quarter of the town's 800houses were boarding and lodging houses. Most were in Great Malvern, the town centre, while others were in the surrounding settlements of Malvern Wells, Malvern Link, North Malvern and West Malvern.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, the {{popularity}} of the <b>hydrotherapy</b> had declined to the extent that many hotels were already being converted into private boarding schools and rest homes, and education became the basis of Malvern's economy. By 1865, the town already had 17single-gender private schools, increasing to 25 by 1885. The area was well suited for schools due to its established attractive environment and access by rail. Children could travel unaccompanied with their trunks by rail to their boarding schools near the stations in Great Malvern, Malvern Wells, and Malvern Link. Malvern St James (formerly Malvern Girls College), located in a former hotel directly opposite Great Malvern railway station, has a dedicated (now derelict) tunnel to the basement of the building, which is clearly visible from both platforms of the station.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} tests {{conducted}} by the PSB Corporation and SGS Testing & Control Services found the spring water contains 420mg of chloride per litre, an amount which is substantially higher than the 35 to 100mg in the water from Choa Chu Kang and Bedok waterworks. It was {{also found that the}} sulphide content is three times more than tap water and the spring water is also slightly alkaline due to the presence of minerals. Natural spring waters may have health benefits, similar to the hot springs of other countries near tectonic plates with volcanoes, in a search for cures for some skin conditions, as well as debilitating ailments like rheumatism and arthritis. Although local rheumatologists conceded that <b>hydrotherapy</b> is an accepted treatment that can be helpful for mild forms of rheumatism or muscle strain, they, along with dermatologists, remain skeptical of claims about the alternative healing of the natural spring water.|$|E

25|$|Canine <b>hydrotherapy</b> {{is a form}} of <b>hydrotherapy</b> {{directed}} at the treatment of chronic conditions, post-operative recovery, and pre-operative or general fitness in dogs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrotherapy</b> {{was used}} to treat {{people with mental illness}} in the 19th and 20th centuries and before World War II, various forms of <b>hydrotherapy</b> were used to treat {{alcoholism}}. The basic text of the Alcoholics Anonymous fellowship, Alcoholics Anonymous, reports that A.A. co-founder Bill Wilson was treated by <b>hydrotherapy</b> for his alcoholism in the early 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Obese dogs {{can build}} fitness and lose weight {{as a result}} of {{exercise}} in a <b>hydrotherapy</b> pool without putting excessive weight on their joints. <b>Hydrotherapy</b> may be used as part of a general fitness routine for dogs.|$|E
25|$|Practitioners of <b>hydrotherapy</b> {{may seek}} {{use it to}} produce {{vasodilation}} and vasoconstriction. These cause changes in blood flow and associated metabolic functions, via physiological mechanisms, including those of thermoregulation, that are these days fairly well understood, and which underpin the contemporary use of <b>hydrotherapy.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrotherapy,</b> {{especially}} as promoted {{during the height}} of its Victorian revival, has often been {{associated with the use of}} cold water, as evidenced by many titles from that era. However, not all therapists limited their practice of <b>hydrotherapy</b> to cold water, even {{during the height of}} this popular revival.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to its thermal baths, in 1986, {{the town}} had around 52,000 <b>hydrotherapy</b> {{visitors}} and 1992, more than 44,550 <b>hydrotherapy</b> visitors. Since the year 2000, {{as a result of}} the disappearance of the agreements with the social security, attendance has decreased. Aix-les-Bains hosted approximately 35,200 <b>hydrotherapy</b> visitors for the year 2005. This number represents about 7% of all spa guests in France and 60% of the Savoy <b>hydrotherapy</b> visitors. Between the year 2004 and 2005, a significant decrease of 3% in the rate of attendance was found. March 2008 began with a serious conflict between staff and management which resulted in a strike. Since 2007, the direction of the National Baths of Aix-les-Bains conducted a deliberate policy to revitalize attendance and privatise the facility. This privatisation should be effective in the course of the year 2009.|$|E
25|$|Kellogg also {{advocated}} <b>hydrotherapy</b> {{and stressed}} the importance of keeping the colon clean through yogurt enemas.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{introduction}} of <b>hydrotherapy</b> to the U.S., John Harvey Kellogg employed it at Battle Creek Sanitarium, which opened in 1866, where he strove to improve the scientific foundation for <b>hydrotherapy.</b> Other notable hydropathic centers of the era included the Cleveland Water Cure Establishment, founded in 1848, which operated successfully for two decades, before being sold to an organization which transformed it into an orphanage.|$|E

25|$|In the Eaux-Chaudes Valley, {{there is}} one cold and eight hot springs used for <b>hydrotherapy.</b> Some are radioactive, and contain sulfides, chlorobromides, and arsenic.|$|E
25|$|As an {{alternative}} or complement to weight-bearing exercise and medication, canine <b>hydrotherapy</b> may speed recovery after operations or slow {{the progression of}} degenerative conditions. It {{may be used as}} a pre-operative fitness regime to allow a dog to maintain condition before an operation if it can not exercise normally. When a congenital condition is identified in a puppy, it may be the case that surgery is not possible until the animal is physically mature; during the period preceding the surgery, <b>hydrotherapy</b> can be employed to maintain the dog's condition.|$|E
25|$|The first U.S. hydropathic {{facilities}} were established by Joel Shew and R. T. Trall in the 1840s. Dr Charles Munde also established early <b>hydrotherapy</b> {{facilities in the}} 1850s. Trall also co-edited the Water Cure Journal.|$|E
25|$|The {{greyhound}} racing industry eventually recognized {{the benefits of}} the equine treatment and in the UK was brought to the forefront by a specialized canine <b>hydrotherapy</b> pool. From there, the therapy was extended to dogs in general.|$|E
25|$|Various therapies used in {{the present-day}} <b>hydrotherapy</b> employ water jets, {{underwater}} massage and mineral baths (e.g. balneotherapy, Iodine-Grine therapy, Kneipp treatments, Scotch hose, Swiss shower, thalassotherapy) or whirlpool bath, hot Roman bath, hot tub, Jacuzzi, cold plunge and mineral bath.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, Franklin Roosevelt, {{convinced}} {{of the benefits of}} <b>hydrotherapy,</b> bought a resort at Warm Springs, Georgia, where he founded the first modern rehabilitation center for treatment of polio patients which still operates as the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation.|$|E
25|$|Cryotherapy, {{cold water}} {{immersion}} or ice bath {{is a new}} form of <b>hydrotherapy</b> used by physical therapists, sports medicine facilities and rehab clinics. Proponents claim improved return of blood flow and byproducts of cellular breakdown to the lymphatic system and more efficient recycling.|$|E
25|$|During its operation, {{treatments}} at Fairfield Hills included <b>hydrotherapy,</b> {{the use of}} {{the drugs}} metrazol and insulin in shock therapy, patient seclusion, electroconvulsive therapy, treatment of alcoholism, and frontal lobotomy. In the first year that psychosurgery was performed at Fairfield Hills over 100 patients were treated.|$|E
25|$|Pool {{designs for}} canine <b>hydrotherapy</b> vary, but most have generic elements. The pool {{tends to be}} smaller than a human {{swimming}} pool and is heated. (This is unlike equine <b>hydrotherapy</b> pools. Horses generate a lot of body heat when swimming, so equine pools use cold water to prevent the animal overheating.) A dog's muscles benefit from the warming effects of the heated water. Most pools have a ramp for entry and exit and some have harnesses to maintain the dog in position in the water. There may be a manual or electric hoist for lifting dogs {{in and out of}} the water. Water is chlorinated or treated with an alternative chemical. Some have jets to add resistance and make the dog swim more strongly.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrotherapy</b> as {{a formal}} medical tool dates from about 1829 when Vincenz Priessnitz (1799–1851), a farmer of Gräfenberg in Silesia, then {{part of the}} Austrian Empire, began his public career in the {{paternal}} homestead, extended so as to accommodate the increasing numbers attracted by the fame of his cures.|$|E
25|$|The new $12 million aquatic {{sports complex}} (known as the Aztec Aquaplex), {{includes}} an Olympic-size swimming pool, a separate recreational pool and beach, and a <b>hydrotherapy</b> spa. This facility is {{home for the}} swimming and diving teams, {{in addition to providing}} recreational use for all SDSU students and community members.|$|E
25|$|Alternating the temperatures, {{either in}} a shower or {{complementary}} tanks, combines the use of hot and cold in the same session. Proponents claim improvement in circulatory system and lymphatic drainage. Experimental evidence suggests that contrast <b>hydrotherapy</b> helps to reduce injury in the acute stages by stimulating blood flow and reducing swelling.|$|E
25|$|The new Annette Kellerman aquatic centre {{was opened}} on 26 January 2011. It {{features}} a , eight-lane Swimming Pool catering to lap swimmers, squads and swimming carnivals; a dedicated programs pool / <b>hydrotherapy</b> pool {{set up for}} learn-to-swim lessons, aquaerobics classes and rehabilitation activities; and a leisure Pool – {{a great place to}} bring young children for fun safe and healthy activity.|$|E
25|$|Water therapy may be {{restricted}} to use as aquatic therapy, a form of physical therapy, and as a cleansing agent. However, it is also used as a medium for delivery of heat and cold to the body, which {{has long been the}} basis for its application. <b>Hydrotherapy</b> involves a range of methods and techniques, many of which use water as a medium to facilitate thermoregulatory reactions for therapeutic benefit.|$|E
25|$|The Texas men's and women's {{basketball}} teams have separate 9,000-square-foot practice court areas, each consisting of one full-court and one half-court practice area with seven basket stations. The practice facility {{also includes a}} locker room with a players' lounge, an instructional film theater, a 4,100-square-foot strength and conditioning area, an athletic training and <b>hydrotherapy</b> area, an academic resource and activity center, and a coaches' lounge and locker room.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrotherapy</b> {{for humans}} {{has been used}} since ancient times, and some attempt at formalizing {{treatment}} was made during the 18th century. Similarly, the benefits of sea water for the treatment and prevention of leg injuries in horses {{has been known for}} centuries. Because of the financial benefits surrounding the treatment of race horses, around the mid-19th century inventors began to produce devices to replicate the benefits of cold sea water immersion for horses.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrotherapy,</b> {{formerly}} called hydropathy {{and also}} called water cure, {{is a part}} of medicine and alternative medicine, in particular of naturopathy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy, that involves the use of water for pain relief and treatment. The term encompasses a broad range of approaches and therapeutic methods that take advantage of the physical properties of water, such as temperature and pressure, for therapeutic purposes, to stimulate blood circulation and treat the symptoms of certain diseases.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1925, Roosevelt {{spent most}} of his time in the Southern United States on his houseboat, the Larooco. Intrigued by the {{potential}} benefits of <b>hydrotherapy,</b> he established a rehabilitation center at Warm Springs, Georgia, in 1926. To create the rehabilitation center, Roosevelt assembled a staff of physical therapists and used most of his inheritance to purchase the Merriweather Inn. In 1938, he founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, leading to the development of polio vaccines.|$|E
