5000|$|In Episode 12, Chance did {{not choose}} anyone, {{although}} he revealed on the reunion <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to,</b> he'd <b>have</b> chosen Risky.|$|R
60|$|But no! <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> give in <b>to</b> something: <b>if</b> <b>he</b> really <b>had</b> <b>to</b> give in, and {{it seemed}} he had: then he would rather {{give in to the}} little Lilly than to the beastly people of the world. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> give in, then it should be to no woman, and to no social ideal, and to no social institution. No!--if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> yield his wilful independence, and give himself, then he would rather give himself to the little, {{individual}} man than to any of the rest. For to tell the truth, in the man was something incomprehensible, which had dominion over him, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> chose to allow it.|$|R
60|$|Sam {{leaned across}} {{the table with a}} stern set face. He meant to change the {{conversation}} <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do it with a crowbar.|$|R
25|$|As {{time goes}} by, Babe feels {{increasingly}} guilty of holding Jamie {{back from his}} {{dream of becoming a}} doctor. Due to the terms of his great-aunt Phoebe's will, Jamie will have to leave Babe (now his fiancée) to acquire his inheritance. According to the terms of the will, Jamie will have {{to be the one to}} end the relationship; it has to be his choice to have nothing to do with Babe. Babe hatches a scheme with Josh to convince Jamie that she and Josh are lovers.

25|$|Superman-Prime, {{surviving}} The Sinestro Corps War and now {{appearing as}} an adult wearing a black and silver variation of Superman's costume (like the one Superman himself wore when he was resurrected), continues his travels throughout the Multiverse {{in order to find}} the perfect universe. Superman-Prime attacks the Lex Luthor of Earth-15, while searching for his perfect universe, which he believes is owed to him. He brings Lex to that Earth's Fortress of Solitude, and kills that world's Superman (Zod) and his pregnant wife and then flies through the Justice League Satellite, killing Luthor and the Justice League members inside the satellite. Expressing his disgust over the League lacking the roster he desires, he returns to Earth and kills the Earth-15 Wonder Woman (Donna) and Batman (Jason). Realizing this is not the perfect Earth he is looking for, Superman-Prime dives through the planet and destroys it. He vows to find his perfect universe even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> tear apart the entire Multiverse to do so. Building a secret lair in the Source Wall itself, Superman-Prime captures Mister Mxyzptlk and Annataz Arataz, an evil analogue of Zatanna, and forces them to give him their magic powers as a replacement for the energies he temporarily absorbed from a Guardian. After her torture at Superman-Prime's hands, Annataz experiences a change of heart and, as a way to atone for her past, taunts Superman-Prime until he lets Mxyzptlk escape, facing his tantrums alone. Superman-Prime destroys his base, burns Annataz alive, and flees. Mxyzptlk orders Gsptlsnz, his girlfriend, to seal off the Fifth Dimension. Superman-Prime later travels to the Multiversal nexus where he finds Solomon and demands his aid. Forerunner arrives as Superman-Prime threatens to kill Solomon unless he shows him his perfect universe; Solomon then shows Superman-Prime the war transpiring on Earth-51. Superman-Prime then flies down to Earth-51 and smashes into Monarch's command center. After fighting for a while, Monarch mocks Superman-Prime as a child, causing Superman-Prime to tear a hole in Monarch's containment suit, which sets of a chain reaction that destroys Earth-51 and the surrounding universe. Nix Uotan, the Monitor of Earth-51 and sole survivor of the cataclysm, cries as he finds a sapling emerging from scorched ground.|$|E
500|$|Ike {{indicates}} he will [...] "vomit my balls {{out through}} my mouth" [...] <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> hear anything more about Susan Boyle, the Scottish amateur singer who gained worldwide attention {{around the time}} of the episode's airing for her performance of the song [...] "I Dreamed a Dream" [...] from Les Misérables on the show Britain's Got Talent. The Boyle reference in particular received a great deal of media attention the week [...] "Fatbeard" [...] first aired. Cartman says that Jewish people, Mexicans, and ginger-haired people are not allowed to be pirates. The French schooner crew members are portrayed as pretentious cowards, a stereotype of the French based on the government's surrender during World War II. The schooner itself strongly resembles the French luxury yacht Le Ponant, which was seized by Somali pirates in April 2008. Cartman refers to Blackbeard, the famous English pirate from the 17th and 18th centuries, from whom the episode derives its name. Much of the décor and music in the episode is influenced by the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride and associated film franchise. Kevin wields a toy lightsaber, the Jedi weapon from the Star Wars films; this is also a reference to the sixth season episode [...] "The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers", in which he dresses as an Imperial stormtrooper while the rest of the boys are in Lord of the Rings attire.|$|E
60|$|Peter nodded. He {{knew that}} <b>he</b> could swim <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to,</b> {{but only for}} a very little way, and he hated the thought of it.|$|R
60|$|Carl was not {{discouraged}} about life. He {{swore that}} {{now he would}} be an aviator even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go to Dayton or Hammondsport or France.|$|R

500|$|HM Prison Maze was {{considered}} one of the most escape-proof prisons in Europe. In addition to [...] fences, each H-Block was encompassed by an [...] concrete wall topped with barbed wire, and all gates on the complex were made of solid steel and electronically operated. Prisoners had been planning the escape for several months. Bobby Storey and Gerry Kelly had started working as orderlies in H7, which allowed them to identify weaknesses in the security systems, and six handguns had been smuggled into the prison. Shortly after 2:30 pm on 25 September, prisoners seized control of H7 by simultaneously taking the prison officers hostage at gunpoint in order to prevent them from triggering an alarm. One officer was stabbed with a craft knife, and another was knocked down by a blow to the back of the head. One officer who attempted to prevent the escape was shot in the head by Gerry Kelly, but survived. By 2:50 pm the prisoners were in control of H7 without an alarm being raised. A dozen prisoners also took uniforms from the officers, and the officers were also forced to hand over their car keys and details of where their cars were, for possible later use during the escape. A rearguard was left behind to watch over hostages and keep the alarm from being raised until they believed the escapees were clear of the prison, when they returned to their cells. At 3:25 pm, a lorry delivering food supplies arrived at the entrance to H7, whereupon Brendan McFarlane and other prisoners took the occupants hostage at gunpoint and took them inside H7. The lorry driver was told the lorry was being used in the escape, and he was instructed what route to take and how to react if challenged. Storey told the driver, [...] "This man [...] is doing 30 years and he will shoot you without hesitation <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to.</b> He has nothing to lose." ...|$|E
2500|$|To help mankind {{to fight}} violence, he has studied Buddhism and Hinduism {{and is now}} a Roman Catholic priest of the Franciscan Brothers of the Poor. However, Darius {{believes}} more in the spirit than in the letter of dogmas. MacLeod says of him, [...] "I don't think Darius believes in religion or a set of rules, [...] being your brother's keeper. I think Darius, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> help mankind, he has to honor their codes." ...|$|E
2500|$|A mysterious vampire called Dracula {{appears in}} the Brazilian telenovela [...] (2008-2009). In fact, he is a mutant vampire created by mixing his DNA with vampire bat DNA. Unlike in the novel, this Dracula is neither invincible nor undead, but he does possess superhuman {{strength}} {{and the ability to}} fly, and he also transforms some female characters into his vampire brides. His lieutenant is a ghoulish vampire called Bram, in homage to the original author. His nemesis is psychokinetic (and psychotic as well) vampire hunter Christiano Pena, who is bent on destroying Dracula, even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> kill innocents to do so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Grace, [...] "it {{would be}} very hard <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go! But <b>if</b> <b>he</b> hasn't money, he couldn't carry on, even if we renewed the lease." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What?" [...] Lush {{put down}} his cigar and thrust {{his hands into his}} side pockets, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> face {{something}} exasperating, but meant to keep his temper.|$|R

2500|$|Arriving at the cave, Cornelius is {{intercepted by}} Dr. Zaius and his soldiers. Taylor holds them off, {{threatening}} to shoot them <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to.</b> Zaius agrees {{to enter the}} cave to disprove their theories and to avoid physical harm to Cornelius and Zira. Inside, Cornelius displays {{the remnants of a}} technologically advanced human society pre-dating simian history. Taylor identifies artifacts such as dentures, eyeglasses, a heart valve and, to the apes' astonishment, a talking children's doll. More soldiers appear and Lucius is overpowered, but Taylor again fends them off. [...] Dr. Zaius is held hostage so Taylor can escape, but he admits to Taylor that he has always known that a human civilization existed long before apes ruled the planet and that [...] "the Forbidden Zone was once a paradise, your breed made a desert of it… ages ago!" [...] Taylor nonetheless thinks it best to search for answers, but Dr. Zaius warns him that he may not like what he finds. Once Taylor and Nova have ridden off, Dr. Zaius has the gorillas lay explosives to seal off the cave and destroy the remaining evidence of the human society. He then has Zira, Cornelius and Lucius charged with heresy.|$|E
6000|$|LORD GORING. Of which I {{know nothing}} by experience, though I know {{something}} by observation. I {{think that in}} practical life {{there is something about}} success, actual success, that is a little unscrupulous, something about ambition that is unscrupulous always.

5000|$|According to Choe Seungno, Gwangjong [...] "was {{careful and}} laconic, but bold <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> seize an opportunity." [...] <b>He</b> <b>had</b> {{excellent}} appearance and qualities, and {{he received a}} special love from his father.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! {{only too}} well. He takes the {{management}} of him as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were three years old, or a lunatic. He simply will not be offended any more than <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do with a baby.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, the villains! Poor pony," [...] exclaimed Betty indignantly. [...] "Eb, I'll coax Wetzel {{to fetch}} the pony home <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> kill every Shawnee in the valley." ...|$|E
