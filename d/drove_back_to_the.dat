5|$|Brynn {{drove to}} the home of her friend Ron Douglas and confessed to the killing, but {{initially}} he did not believe her. The pair <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house in separate cars, and Brynn called another friend and confessed a second time. Upon seeing Hartman's body, Douglas called 911 at 6:20a.m. Police subsequently arrived and escorted Douglas and the Hartmans' two children from the premises, by which time Brynn had locked herself in the bedroom and committed suicide by shooting herself in the mouth.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, {{which took place}} in dry weather conditions for most of the 90-minute period and became wet when rain fell in the closing stages which prevented any drivers from improving on their fastest times, Brendon Hartley in Porsche's No. 1 car set an early lap time of one minute and 39.655 seconds which remained the fastest time {{for the remainder of the}} session. He was 1.6 seconds quicker than Romain Dumas in the team's No. 2 entry, who in turn, was two-tenths of a second faster than Loïc Duval in the No. 8 Audi. A LMGTE car impacted Dumas, causing him to spin into the turn seven gravel trap, and sustained damage to his car's right-rear tyre, causing the deployment of a full course yellow flag. He was extracted from the gravel trap and <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pit lane for car repairs. Jonny Kane in the No. 36 Signatech Alpine was the fastest driver in LMP2 with a time of one minute and 49.632 seconds set in the session's closing minutes, nearly one-tenth of a second in front of Jakes. LMGTE Pro was led by James Calado in the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari 488 GTE, while Carroll's Gulf Racing car was fastest in LMGTE Am, despite driving off the track in the session's closing minutes.|$|E
25|$|The Steelers {{responded with}} a long 15-play drive to retake the lead on Gary Anderson's 30-yard field goal, making the score 10–7. After a punt, Pittsburgh <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chiefs 35-yard line, only to turn the ball over on downs. Kansas City then took over {{and drove to the}} Steelers 42, but on fourth down and 1, {{defensive}} end Gerald Williams sacked Montana for a 7-yard loss, giving his team the ball on their own 49 with under a minute left. The Steelers made the most of their opportunity, scoring on O'Donnell's 26-yard touchdown completion to Ernie Mills that increased their lead to 17–7 {{at the end of the}} half.|$|E
50|$|About 10 {{miles outside}} of Sioux Falls, the gang {{released}} the hostages, and drove off. The hostages were eventually {{picked up by a}} passing motorist who <b>drove</b> them <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bank.|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{the heart}} of the plain he drove them, [...] And he <b>drove</b> them <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hill: [...] <b>To</b> <b>the</b> top of the hill he drove them, [...] As he {{followed}} them, followed them still!" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{started off}} {{without waiting for}} a reply, and all the Americans followed. Together they circled the horses and <b>drove</b> them <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corral. When Billy had saddled and mounted {{he saw that the}} others had done likewise.|$|R
25|$|Just {{minutes before}} the murder, Sheriff's Deputy Don Welch had driven by and spotted Lunsford {{speaking}} to the men. Moments after the murder, Welch witnessed the suspects speed past him in their vehicle. Welch immediately <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spot where Lunsford had been and found his dead body. Welch radioed for help, and at around 2:00a.m., Chief Deputy Stanaland, another colleague of Lunsford, found them both. Stanaland noticed the video camera in Lunsford's cruiser. He rewound the video, watched it over and then made a copy of it. The three suspects, realizing Welch had spotted them, abandoned their vehicle {{less than a mile}} from the town of Garrison. They then fled on foot, taking the marijuana with them. Their vehicle was found later in the day.|$|E
25|$|At dusk, {{with the}} dead and wounded piling up, Anderson sent two {{ambulances}} filled with critically wounded men to the bridge under a flag of truce, requesting that they be allowed to pass through to the Allied lines beyond. The Japanese refused, and instead demanded that the Indian brigade surrender, offering {{to care for the}} wounded. Still hopeful of relief, Anderson refused to consider surrendering. The Japanese then ordered that the ambulances were to remain on the bridge to act as a roadblock, and they would be shot if they attempted to move. After dark, Lieutenant Austin and a driver, both of whom were themselves wounded, slipped the brakes of the ambulances, and let them run quietly backwards down the slope from the bridge. Amid the roar of gunfire, they started the engines and <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brigade.|$|E
25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb. Park {{testified that he}} had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the {{prosecution}} presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin {{hung up the phone and}} ventured outside to investigate the noises but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E
60|$|He {{talked for}} an hour with the girl, gave her {{explicit}} instructions, thrust some money into her hand, and then <b>drove</b> her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bend in the path whence she quickly made her way up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> great house.|$|R
5000|$|Yes, the 190 {{was causing}} us real {{problems}} at this time. We could out-turn it, but you couldn't turn all day. As {{the number of}} 190s increased, so the depth of our penetrations deceased. They <b>drove</b> us <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coast really.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Cæsar," [...] I heard Azalea Adair answer weakly. And then I {{went in and}} {{concluded}} business negotiations with our contributor. I assumed the responsibility of advancing fifty dollars, putting it as a necessary formality in binding our bargain. And then Uncle Cæsar <b>drove</b> me <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel.|$|R
500|$|Marciello {{employed}} the DRS {{on the fourth}} lap to close to Nato heading into the first turn while battling him for fourth place. As the two drivers battled through turn four, Pic got ahead of them. Nato changed his line by braking for the seventh corner, and Marciello made an aggressive passing manoeuvre, causing both drivers {{to make contact with}} Pic, sending him spinning backwards. Gasly arrived at the apex of the turn and was collected by Pic who also drove into Marciello. Pic, Gasly and Marciello retired immediately and the safety car was deployed. Drivers who had started on the soft-compound tyres elected to change to the medium-compound tyres during their mandatory pit stops, which meant they rejoined the race outside of the top ten. These drivers had to hope that the medium-compound tyres would last {{until the end of the}} race while pushing hard. Marciello <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pit lane and retired. King was forced to wait behind Rossi during the pit stop phase and fell to 17th.|$|E
500|$|Major Werncke of the Panzer-Lehr Division {{conducted}} a reconnaissance of Point 213 {{later in the}} morning and [...] reconnoitring on foot, discovered a column of unoccupied Cromwell tanks. The tank crews were studying a map with an officer {{at the front of the}} column and Werncke drove one off before the British could react. At the east end of Villers-Bocage, he found a scene of [...] "burning tanks and Bren-gun carriers and dead Tommies" [...] and <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Panzer-Lehr headquarters at Château d'Orbois. After the ambush on Point 213, A Squadron, 4th CLY had nine tanks operational, including two Fireflies and a Cromwell OP tank, although some were short of crew. There was one rifle section and an equal number of officers. It was decided to hold the position on the ridge until reinforcements arrived and an all round defence was organised. At around 10:00, support and reconnaissance troops of the 4th Company, schwere SS-Panzer Abteilung 101 arrived and began to collect prisoners between the ridge and the town. Some of the British escaped and about 30 got back to British lines.|$|E
2500|$|Meola {{made his}} U.S. National Team debut on June 10, 1988, against Ecuador. [...] Meola's second cap {{came in a}} June 4, 1989 victory over Peru in the Marlboro Cup which won the U.S. the cup. [...] The team took the trophy to the Scots-American Club in Kearny, New Jersey. [...] After the party, Meola <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> team's hotel, dropped the trophy {{at the front desk}} and drove home. [...] As he remembers it, [...] "A week later Doug Newman called me up and asked where the cup was. [...] I told him I'd left it at for him at the hotel[...] [...] [...] I'm sure they got it back. [...] Back then there weren't too many cups in U.S. Soccer." ...|$|E
60|$|That answer <b>drove</b> Mr. Neal <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last inch {{of ground}} left {{him to stand}} on. Even on that inch the Scotchman {{resisted}} still.|$|R
50|$|Sauron {{attacked}} Gondor {{and captured}} Minas Ithil. Isildur escaped down the Anduin and sailed to bring help from Elendil in the North, while Anárion defended Gondor against Sauron. His forces held Osgiliath and <b>drove</b> Sauron <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mountains for a time, though {{he realized that}} Gondor would not stand unless help arrived.|$|R
60|$|After much haggling over terms--since <b>to</b> give <b>the</b> sum {{that was}} first asked would have excited surprise, and perhaps suspicion--Harry became the {{possessor}} {{of the horse}} and cart, <b>drove</b> triumphantly <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village, and having stowed Louise and the two girls on some straw {{in the bottom of}} the cart, proceeded on the journey.|$|R
2500|$|The Australian {{anti-tank}} guns of G Troop were {{to remain}} in dug-in gun positions until the rearguard began to move and then portees would come up to collect the guns. Panzers attacked from the south-east, paused near a re-entrant and moved into line, a tank then advanced opposite one of the guns of G Troop, which opened rapid fire until the gun was blown up. More tanks followed and were engaged by another Australian gun. The tanks crossed the re-entrant under fire and several stopped then sheered off but [...] after the Axis attack had begun, tanks reached the fort. The parties with Vaughan and Munro stopped on a rise to watch the breakout but saw no forces following. Vaughan called Gambier-Parry who replied that the fire was too heavy for the [...] vehicles. Vaughan suggested an attempt {{to the south and}} with Munro, <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fort and the force outside the perimeter made for El Adem. Munro found knocked-out guns of the 11th Battery and several disabled light tanks nearby. With the main force trapped, Gambier-Parry ordered the 2nd Lancers to remain and cover the withdrawal of divisional headquarters to the west.|$|E
60|$|They {{laid the}} {{flowers on the}} fresh earth, even the white roses, and then they <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E
60|$|But the bewildered {{girls had}} no such confidence. They <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> farm to consult with Uncle John and Arthur.|$|E
50|$|The decisive Battle of Sidi Bou Othman {{with the}} French took place near Marrakech on 6 September 1912. al-Hiba's forces were {{defeated}} by the French commanded by Charles Mangin, {{with the loss of}} some 2000 tribal warriors. In January 1913, the Glaoua family, now allied with <b>the</b> French, <b>drove</b> al-Hiba <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sous.|$|R
60|$|They lifted {{them both}} up for dead, and Compton, taking Fan in his strong arms, held {{her like a}} child as they <b>drove</b> slowly <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ranch. All {{believed}} Lester dead; but Compton, who held his ear to Fan's lips, insisted that she was breathing, and indeed she recovered from her swoon before they reached the house.|$|R
2500|$|Immediately {{after taking}} the {{checkered}} flag, Alan Kulwicki <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> around <b>to</b> <b>the</b> frontstretch. He proceeded <b>to</b> stop at <b>the</b> flagstand and turn around, to drive what he {{referred to as a}} [...] "Polish victory lap", clockwise (backwards) around <b>the</b> track, waving <b>to</b> fans. It mimicked a similar celebration he did at his first victory in 1988 at Phoenix.|$|R
60|$|Seeing his condition, {{the father}} and son lifted him on the sledge, wrapped him in skins, and <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> huts at full speed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, perhaps," [...] he replied, in {{unabated}} perplexity. He bade them serve God, and {{let them}} out into the snowy night, through which they <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel.|$|E
60|$|It {{was nearly}} nightfall when Peleg Snuggers <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hall. Dick and Tom met him {{just outside the}} gates {{and saw that the}} man-of-all-work looked much dejected.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, I found them, {{or rather}} they found me, {{and in my}} {{presence}} the goddess executed her decree upon her false priest and <b>drove</b> his temptress <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world." ...|$|R
60|$|So saying, Leif ordered <b>the</b> men <b>to</b> keep up a {{constant}} discharge of arrows whenever they obtained {{a glimpse of}} the savages, and he himself headed a sally and <b>drove</b> them <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woods. But as soon as he and his men had returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fortress, out came the savages again like a swarm of bees, and continued their work vigorously.|$|R
6000|$|While they [...] "whacked," [...] Anne listened or dreamed. Sometimes Leslie went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{lighthouse}} with them, {{and she and}} Anne wandered {{along the}} shore in the eerie twilight, or sat on the rocks below the lighthouse until <b>the</b> darkness <b>drove</b> them <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cheer of the driftwood fire. Then Captain Jim would brew them tea and tell them ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Our next move, Mr. Armadale, {{is not a}} {{very easy}} move to see," [...] he said, as they <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel. [...] "Do you think you could put me in {{possession}} of any further particulars?" ...|$|E
60|$|They lunched {{together}} at the Holborn, and Jack took Maude afterwards to what he called 'a real instructive show,' which {{proved to be a}} horse-sale at Tattersall's. They then <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lawyer's, and there they found a letter waiting addressed to Mrs. Crosse. Maude tore it open.|$|E
60|$|But {{before the}} Duke's {{somewhat}} long-winded {{series of questions}} had gone very far Mr. Sabin grasped {{the fact that the}} servants had been tampered with. Without wasting any more time he took a somewhat hurried leave and <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel. One of the hall porters approached him, smiling.|$|E
5000|$|Gaal had {{occupied}} Shechem and boasted <b>to</b> Zebul, <b>the</b> ruler of Shechem, {{that he could}} defeat Abimelech. Zebul secretly warned Abimelech of Gaal's plans and offered a plan to defeat Gaal. Abimelech defeated Gaal and <b>drove</b> him <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gates of Shechem. Zebul subsequently drove Gaal and his remaining kinsmen from Shechem altogether. He is not mentioned thereafter in the Bible.|$|R
50|$|Lieutenant Herbert Edwardes, the British Political Agent in Bannu, {{had been}} near Multan in April {{but was unable}} to save Vans Agnew.

He <b>drove</b> them <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city but was unable <b>to</b> attack <b>the</b> fortified city itself.|$|R
25|$|On 29 September 2013, terminally-ill eight-year-old Emilia Palmer {{was driven}} by Hammond in a pink Lamborghini Aventador Roadster.
