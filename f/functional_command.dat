5|$|The Federal {{government}} retired Air Marshal Jones in 1952 {{and replaced}} him with Air Marshal Donald Hardman, RAF, who proceeded to re-organise the RAAF command-and-control system along functional lines, establishing Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands in October 1953. The first was re-formed from Eastern Area Command {{as it was}} considered the RAAF's de facto operational organisation. The second was re-formed from Southern Area Command, {{as it was the}} hub of training services, controlling those in New South Wales and Queensland as well as Victoria and South Australia. The third and last <b>functional</b> <b>command</b> was formed from the extant Maintenance Group headquarters in Melbourne. The transition to a functional system was completed in February 1954, when the three new commands assumed control of operations, training and maintenance from Western, North-Western, and North-Eastern Areas.|$|E

The first was re-formed {{from the existing}} Eastern Area Command, which was considered a de facto operational organisation owing to the preponderance of combat forces within its sphere. The second was re-formed from Southern Area Command, as it was already the hub of training services, controlling those in New South Wales and Queensland as well as Victoria and South Australia. The third and final <b>functional</b> <b>command</b> was formed from the extant Maintenance Group headquarters in Melbourne. The transition to a functional system was completed in February 1954, when the three new commands assumed control of all operations, training and maintenance from Western, North-Western, and North-Eastern Area Commands.|$|E
500|$|The Federal {{government}} retired Jones in February 1952 {{and replaced}} {{him with an}} RAF officer, Air Marshal Donald Hardman, who was well versed in the <b>functional</b> <b>command</b> system employed in Britain. Hardman believed that restructuring the Air Force would remove inefficiencies and duplication, and permit commanders greater autonomy, allowing more effective concentration of strength in a potential combat situation. He declared that the RAAF was [...] "the one force that could quickly strike for Australia's and the Commonwealth's defence in South East Asia". To this end he proposed reorganising command {{and control of the}} Air Force according to three major functions: operations, covering home defence and mobile task forces; training, including all permanent, reserve and national service recruitment and instruction; and maintenance, responsible for supply, equipment and other logistical services. The three functions were duly constituted in October 1953 as Home, Training, and Maintenance Commands, respectively.|$|E
500|$|The Army {{intended}} for this reorganization to end inter-branch rivalries and competition for pre-eminence and resources; {{in fact it}} met with mixed success as advocates for each branch continued to argue among themselves. [...] Additionally, competition for authority and resources also emerged between the War Department General Staff and the three <b>functional</b> <b>commands,</b> and between the <b>functional</b> <b>commands</b> themselves. [...] Used to working with minimal delegation, and functioning with the smallest staff possible, McNair largely concentrated on the task at hand, and avoided the rivalries as much as possible. [...] Despite this approach, he was still involved in controversies with the other <b>functional</b> <b>commands,</b> including an ongoing rivalry over allocation of the best qualified recruits and draftees.|$|R
25|$|The 1960s saw a {{reduction}} of the RAF {{and a loss of}} independence of the former <b>functional</b> <b>commands.</b> Transport Command was renamed Air Support Command in 1967.|$|R
5000|$|Within STRATCOM, {{responsibilities}} for space were first {{held by the}} Joint <b>Functional</b> Component <b>Command</b> for Space and Global Strike until July 2006 when the command was divided. [...] the Joint <b>Functional</b> Component <b>Command</b> for Space oversees U.S. military space operations.|$|R
500|$|Hardman {{made two}} major {{changes to the}} {{structure}} of the Air Force to streamline command and control: integrating RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, [...] with the Department of Air, and supplanting the geographical area commands with three functional organisations, namely Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands. The <b>functional</b> <b>command</b> system has been described by historian Alan Stephens as Hardman's [...] "major legacy to the RAAF". While doing away with the area command structure that had been favoured by Jones, Hardman carried on his predecessor's support for the local aircraft industry. He also formed a policy agreement with the Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Sir John Collins, covering joint responsibility and cooperation for maritime warfare. During Hardman's term as CAS, No.78 (Fighter) Wing was re-equipped with RAF deHavilland Vampire jet fighters to garrison Malta and support British operations in the Mediterranean. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the Queen's Birthday Honours promulgated on 5June 1952, and raised to substantive air marshal on 1July.|$|E
500|$|In January 1940, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice-Marshal Jimmy Goble, {{proposed}} organising the RAAF along functional {{lines with}} Home Defence, Training, and Maintenance Commands, but the Federal {{government did not}} take up this plan. Goble was replaced in February by a Royal Air Force (RAF) officer, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, who focussed on rapid expansion of the RAAF {{to meet the needs}} of the Empire Air Training Scheme and believed that Australia's huge land mass would make a <b>functional</b> <b>command</b> system unwieldy. He proceeded to reorganise the Air Force into a geographically based [...] "area" [...] system. The roles of each area command were the same: air defence, protection of adjacent sea lanes, and aerial reconnaissance. Each area was led by an Air Officer Commanding (AOC) who was responsible for the administration and operations of all bases and units within his boundary. Exceptions to this policy included aircraft depots and the Central Flying School that trained flying instructors, as their range of responsibilities crossed area boundaries and therefore came under the direct control of RAAF Headquarters. The static area system was primarily defensive in nature, but considered well-suited to training new pilots, who could be instructed at flying schools and mentored through their initial squadron postings, all within the same geographical region.|$|E
2500|$|Appointed General Officer in Command of Australia's Northern Command in 1968, Hassett {{was awarded}} a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the Queen's Birthday Honours of 1970. Later that year, he was {{selected}} to lead the Army Review Committee, which became more colloquially known as the [...] "Hassett Committee". The committee's far reaching reforms included moving from a geographical to a <b>functional</b> <b>command</b> system, which involved (in part) {{the replacement of the}} various State Army Command Headquarters with a national field force, training and logistics command system; a system that remains largely in place today. In 1971 Hassett was appointed Vice Chief of the General Staff and tasked with implementing the organisational reforms he had initiated, as well as supervising the end of conscription, the withdrawal of Australian troops from Vietnam, and the consequential organisational changes brought about by a reduction in Army manpower.|$|E

25|$|The Indian Air Force {{is divided}} into five {{operational}} and two <b>functional</b> <b>commands.</b> Each Command is headed by an Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief with the rank of Air Marshal. The purpose of an operational command is to conduct military operations using aircraft within its area of responsibility, whereas the responsibility of <b>functional</b> <b>commands</b> is to maintain combat readiness. Aside from the Training Command at Bangalore, the primary flight training is done at the Air Force Academy, Dundigul (located in Hyderabad), followed by operational training at various other schools. Advanced officer training for command positions is also conducted at the Defence Services Staff College; specialised advanced flight training schools are located at Bidar, Karnataka and Hakimpet, Telangana (also the location for helicopter training). Technical schools are found {{at a number of}} other locations.|$|R

50|$|In {{fiscal years}} 2007-2009, the Army Reserve was realigned into a <b>functional</b> <b>command</b> structure. The {{majority}} of Army Reserve units are now assigned to operational and functional commands. Operational commands are deployable elements which command deployable {{units of the}} same or similar capabilities regardless of peacetime geographic location. For instance, the 377th Sustainment Command (Theater) commands all Army Reserve sustainment units, while the 11th Aviation Command commands all Army Reserve aviation assets. Likewise, functional commands are responsible for command of units of the same or similar capabilities regardless of peacetime geographic location, but are not, as a headquarters, deployable.|$|E
50|$|The Virtual Battlespace Systems 1 {{concept was}} {{initially}} conceived in 2001 {{as the result}} of a business decision made between Bohemia Interactive Studio (BIS) and creator David Lagettie. The BIS computer game Operation Flashpoint (OFP) aimed for a highly realistic military gameplay. In order to achieve this the game featured large scale terrain areas combined with a high level of detail, an integrated topographic map, a fully <b>functional</b> <b>command</b> and control system for small teams, and considerable flexibility in the game engine. These functionalities gave the game obvious military potential, and as a result Bohemia Interactive Australia (BIA) was formed and given the task of converting the product explicitly for military purposes.|$|E
5000|$|All of the {{branches}} work together during operations and joint missions in Unified Combatant Commands, {{under the authority of}} the Secretary of Defense {{with the exception of the}} Coast Guard. Each of the Unified Combatant Commands is headed by a Combatant Commander, a senior commissioned officer who exercises supreme command authority per [...] over all of the forces, regardless of branch, within his geographical or <b>functional</b> <b>command.</b> By statute, the chain of command flows from the President to the Secretary of Defense to each of the Combatant Commanders. In practice, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff often acts as an intermediary between the Secretary of Defense and the Combatant Commanders.|$|E
