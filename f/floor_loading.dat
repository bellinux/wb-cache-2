40|$|Global {{industrialization}} {{was developed}} in response to both consumers and manufacturers demand for lower product prices and availability of goods and services. As a result, products are transported greater distances. Shipping constitutes the majority of costs in the export/import supply chain. Shippers and buyers commonly attempt to offset these costs by maximizing the capacity of ocean freight containers (cube or weight). Boxes (usually constructed of corrugated fiberboard) containing consumer grade products are commonly <b>floor</b> <b>loaded</b> into containers to maximize capacity.

50|$|A man-aboard {{system can}} provide {{significant}} floorspace savings over manual or fork lift operations {{but is not}} truly an AS/RS, as the operation is still manual. Storage system heights are not limited by the reach height of the order picker, as the picker rides along on the platform as it is moved vertically or horizontally to the various storage locations. Shelves or storage cabinets can be stacked as high as <b>floor</b> <b>loading,</b> weight capacity, throughput requirements, and/or ceiling heights will permit. Man-aboard storage and retrieval systems are {{far and away the}} most expensive picker-to-stock equipment alternative, but are less expensive than a fully automated system. Aisle-captive storage/retrieval machines reaching heights up to 40 feet cost around $125,000. Hence, there must be enough storage density and/or productivity improvement over cart and tote picking to justify the investment. Also, because vertical travel is slow compared to horizontal travel, typical picking rates in man-aboard operations range between 40 and 250 lines per person-hour. The range is large because there is a wide variety of operating schemes for man-aboard systems. Man-aboard systems are typically appropriate for slow-moving items where space is fairly expensive.|$|E

Moreover, an aircraft has usually several cargo compartments with specific contours and structural limitations such as <b>floor</b> <b>loading,</b> combined load limits and cumulative load limitations. Finally, some shipments are particularly restrictive to transport, like dangerous goods, live animals and perishable goods.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of Eurocode 9 specific design rules for the calculation of aluminium stressed skin panels are available. These design rules {{have been used for}} optimization of two extrusions: one for explosions and wind loading governing and one for explosions and <b>floor</b> <b>loading</b> governing. The optimized extrusions are fulfilling class 3 section properties leading to weight reductions up to 25 % of regularly used shear panel sections. When the design would have been based on class 4 section properties even more weight reduction might have been reached. The failure mode depends on the height of the hat stiffeners. For sections using relatively high hat stiffeners failure is introduced by yielding of the heat affected zone. For these kind of cross sections the Eurocode 9 design rules and numerical calculations show very good agreement. For sections using relatively low hat stiffeners failure is introduced by global buckling. For these kind of cross sections Eurocode 9 gives rather conservative results...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study on}} sandwich panels for slab applications looking at expanded polystyrene core sandwich panels with various materials for the face. The aim {{is to determine the}} optimum thickness for strength and serviceability of a number of sandwich panels. Finite element analysis using Strand 7 and the construction and testing of physical samples were carried out to verify the accuracy of a numerical study. Four panels were constructed using plywood, oriented strand board, aluminium and steel as the face material and were tested in a SANS material testing machine which measured applied loading and mid-span deflection. These same panels were modelled using finite element analysis in the Strand 7 software package under the same conditions as the laboratory tests. The results were compared and found to be in good agreement between them which confirmed the validity of the computer model. Further study was undertaken using Strand 7 to model the same panels with the application of domestic <b>floor</b> <b>loading</b> as per AS 1170. Three formulas to calculate the optimum core thickness with respect to the panel failure mode were tested however were found to be unsuitable for the loading arrangement of a uniformly distributed load and a concentrated load. An iterative approach to determining the optimum core thickness was then used. Modelling various thicknesses of the same span panel allowed the optimum core thickness to be determined for that span that would allow the panel to only deflect a maximum of Span/ 400 or 10 mm. This process was repeated until a span/thickness curve was created that allows the optimum thickness core to be read from the chart for panel spans up to 6 metres. This research project shows that sandwich panel can be used for slab applications under domestic <b>floor</b> <b>loading.</b> The validity of the Strand 7 model has been shown be comparing physical test results to the computer model. By developing span/thickness charts to optimise the core thickness of the panels allows a panel system to be manufactured that will minimise weight and cost while still satisfying strength and serviceability requirements. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper draws {{together}} some important lessons from a compartment fire test conducted by BRE in the full-scale eight storey steel building at Cardington. The experiment is briefly described, {{and the main}} structural observations are highlighted. A numerical structural model of the fire compartment, using the nonlinear analysis program ADAPTIC, is then discussed. The numerical analysis employs a grillage to model the composite floor slab, and uses a one-dimensional element to model the supporting steel beams and columns. Detailed consideration of the numerical model illustrates the importance of accounting for thermal expansion effects, and leads to the identification of a load carrying mechanism at full temperature in which both the floor slab and the composite beam play an important role. A sensitivity study is then carried out in which characteristic sizes of various components and strengths of the different steel and concrete materials are varied, {{and the influence of}} such variations on the floor system response is investigated. This not only highlights the relative importance of various components in resisting the <b>floor</b> <b>loading,</b> but also sheds considerable light on the extent of plasticity developed within the various materials over the structure. Finally, several implications of the present experimental and numerical findings towards an improved design procedure, which accounts for the interaction between the floor slab and the composite beam at elevated temperature, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Longwall mines {{typically}} {{use some}} form of standing support for secondary roof support in longwall tailgate entries. Although {{there have been several}} new support products developed for this application, there remains no universal design criteria to optimize the application of these support technologies. The requirement for optimization and proper support selection is to understand the degree of control that the support has on the ground behavior. The ground reaction curve and numerical modeling was used to evaluate the impact of standing support on ground behavior. LaModel was used to evaluate the impact of standing support on main roof and floor behavior and pillar yielding. The conclusion drawn from this study was that standing supports do not have sufficient capacity to control main roof or <b>floor</b> <b>loading</b> or prevent the resulting convergence of the tailgate entry. However, it is imperative that this uncontrollable convergence be considered in the support design to prevent premature failure of the support. A FLAC model was used to evaluate the near-seam roof and floor behavior in conjunction with the global vertical and horizontal stresses. The model suggests that standing roof supports can have some impact on the ground behavior as the elastic response of the rock is exceeded and rock structure deteriorates from the stress concentrations that develop around the tailgate opening. During this phase, the capacity and stiffness of the standing support can be critical to the stability of the opening, as eventually the rock mass will be transformed into a partially detached structure whose weight must be supported by the standing support. This work is part of a ground control program of research at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) aimed at improving mine safety by reducing roof fall injuries and fatalities...|$|E

In practical design, considering the advantage of high-strength concrete in taking compression, a continuous HSC column is intersected by NSC floor. It is {{of great interest to}} understand the mechanism of load transmission through such type of connection and summarize the general behavior of that. Moreover, it is necessary to investigate possible parameters which may have impacts on the loading capacity. Firstly, literature study was carried out to know existent solutions to this problem. Previous papers and standard codes in different regions were reviewed. Laboratory experiments and proposed equations from literature review were analyzed in this thesis. Different equations were compared, and impacts of parameters were discussed. Seeing deficiencies in previous researches, a numerical experimental program was proposed to investigate the stated problem. Considering advantages in simulating concrete structures, ATENA program was selected as a tool for finite element analysis. Before the parameter study, in order to investigate the general behavior of the connection between HSC column and NSC floor, one standard specimen was constructed. As for the standard specimen, all settings were in accordance with common designs. Only a monotonic load was applied to the structure. The observation and results during the process of loading were recorded and analyzed in this part. The mechanisms of load transmission through the connections were conceived. After that, a parameter study was conducted based on the standard specimen. Four parameters were selected by setting four series of specimens. From series A to D, variables in each series were the concrete strength, the flexural reinforcement in the floor, the aspect ratio (the ratio between the slab thickness to the column width), and the <b>floor</b> <b>loading.</b> Through variable control, each parameter was investigated and their impacts on connections were discussed.

Site selection for academic library buildings is more often than not determined by the first campus master plan, with a little possibility of change. Either in the first selection, or in the next, planner must have in mind some general criteria that can help him in his final choices and the proofs for its Tightness. The organization, which commits the meditation, must give him an episcopic map of the region (mostly for academic libraries), topographic map and ground audits.
