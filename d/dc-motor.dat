40|$|The {{cooling system}} of a <b>DC-motor</b> is {{examined}} in this thesis. A change of direction of the cooling air is desired to prevent the generated coal dust from entering into the windings of the machine. Ultimately this will {{have a negative effect}} on the cooling in the machine and the loss of cooling needs to be compensated through other ways. The purpose of this thesis is to work for an improved operational safety and performance of the <b>DC-motor</b> and to make it more competitive in the market. By modelling the interior geometry of the machine and defining the boundaries in the software programs Gambit and FLUENT respectively, the motion and the heat transfer of the airflow could be simulated. The simulation results would give us an understanding of the flow pattern which later could be used to develop design modifications on the cooling system of a <b>DC-motor.</b> In this thesis the main focus lies on creating a simulation model with a sufficiently fine mesh size...|$|E
40|$|Research {{shows that}} {{flywheels}} {{have a significant}} potential for improving the performance of EV (Electric Vehicle) drivelines. Flywheels {{can be used as}} power buffers that even out the energy flow between the primary energy storage device and the EV traction motor. This improves the potential energy density and extends the lifetime of the primary energy storage device of the EV. In this degree project a prototype of a flywheel-buffered driveline was constructed. The flywheel chosen was an electric motor/generator constructed at the Division of Electricity at Uppsala University. Lead acid batteries were used as the primary energy storage device in the driveline and the traction motor was a <b>DC-motor.</b> Two DC/DC buck converters were designed for the driveline. The first limited the current from the batteries to the flywheel and the second controlled the power from the flywheel to the traction motor. Both converters were controlled by microcontrollers. The current limiter was controlled by a hysteresis controller and the <b>DC-motor</b> power was regulated manually, under the constraint of a maximum current PI-controller. The buck circuits were simulated in MATLAB Simulink prior to their construction. The performance of the driveline was satisfactory, despite the poor efficiency of the <b>DC-motor.</b> The results showed that the efficiency of the flywheel and the power converters was relatively high and that the flywheel had excellent power-buffering properties...|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{are carried}} out with a cm-scale bio-mimetic {{swimming}} robot, which consists of a body and a rigid helical tail and mimics typical eukaryotic micro organisms, inside circular channels filled with viscous fluids. The body of the robot is made of a cylindrical capsule, which includes an onboard power supply, a dedicated <b>DC-motor,</b> and a driving circuitry with IR-receiver for remote control purposes. In experiments geometric parameters of the helical tail, wavelength and amplitude, and {{the diameter of the}} circular channels are varied to understand the effect of those parameters on the swimming speed of the robots. Models, based on slender body theory (SBT) and resistive force theory (RFT), are implemented to predict the swimming speeds, which are then compared with experimentally measured values. A simple model for the <b>DC-motor</b> dynamics is included to account for the contact friction effects on the body rotation rates.

40|$|This thesis work {{contains}} a litterature study about electrical motors {{in general and}} how PWM-patterns for brushless DC-motors can be made. A suitable method has been implemented as a simulation model in VHDL. A simulation model of a brushless <b>DC-motor</b> which describes the phasecurrents, torque and angular velocity has also been made. The motor model made simulations easier for the complete PWM-system. The design was synthesised and tested with a prototypeboard including a SPARTAN II FPGA. In order to test the design, a powerstage and a motor was included. The tests showed that the design was working as expected according to the previous simulations. A study about an alternative way to control a brushless <b>DC-motor</b> has also been made. This alternative is best suited when the generated back-EMK for the motor is sinusoidal. A simulation model for {{a part of a}} system like this has been made, and it has been synthesised in order to examine if it is possible to implement using a FPGA availible today...|$|E
