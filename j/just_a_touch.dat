Metacritic gives the season a score of 96, based on 33 reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim".

500|$|Elsewhere, barmaid Clara Oswin Oswald investigates a {{disturbance}} outside the tavern she works at and finds the Doctor walking by. He attempts to leave discreetly, but Clara follows {{him to a}} coach. Not wishing {{to become involved in}} matters, the Doctor instructs Strax to bring him a memory worm that will erase the last hour of Clara's memories with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch.</b> Before they can do so, they are surrounded by snowmen created from snow with psychic properties who attack the group. The Doctor realises that Clara's thoughts are creating the snowmen and ends the threat by instructing her to think of them melting. Clara cautions the Doctor that if he wipes her memory, she will forget {{how to deal with the}} snowmen. The Doctor reluctantly allows her to go and ascends a staircase to the sky to return to the TARDIS. Clara follows him and knocks on the door, but she hides and flees down the staircase when the Doctor answers. Clara returns to her other job as governess for the children of Captain Latimer. She learns that Latimer's daughter has been having horrible dreams about their previous governess returning from the dead. Clara realises that the pond that contains the old governess' body is the only thing still frozen around them. She attempts to track down the Doctor but instead attracts the attention of Jenny, who takes her to see Vastra. Vastra tells Clara she gets only one word to impress the Doctor with if she wants his help. Clara chooses the word [...] "Pond", which shocks the Doctor and arouses his interest.|$|E
500|$|He has two {{abilities}} {{that the original}} Spider-Man did not have: the ability to camouflage himself, including his clothing, to match his surroundings, and a [...] "venom strike" [...] that can paralyze almost anyone with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch.</b> The venom strike can be conducted through Miles' gloves, {{and can be used}} against an opponent at a distance by conducting it through a material in which both Miles and his opponent are in contact, such as the webbing of the Earth-616's Spider-Man. It can break chains being used to restrain Miles, and even repels non-ferrous objects, such as plastic Lego bricks. The venom strike is powerful enough to render unconscious a person as large as Hank Pym's Giant Man. It is powerful enough to drive away the symbiotic villain Venom during Miles' first encounter with the creature, but by their second encounter, Venom has developed such a tolerance to the strike that Miles has to be completely enveloped by the symbiote before the venom strike can separate the symbiote from its host. The effect of the venom strike manifests itself a few seconds after it is implemented, and is described by Bendis as being comparable to the feeling of being kicked in the testicles. Miles can effect a more powerful version of the strike, which he calls a [...] "mega venom blast". When Miles employs this ability, his eyes glow with yellow energy, which then explodes outwards in a radiant burst that can destroy thick ropes and chains that have been used to restrain him. This application of the strike cannot be used multiple times in rapid succession without a [...] "recharging" [...] period for Miles, though he can still make use of the conventional strike against people.|$|E

2500|$|British singer Jessie J {{covered the}} song, while {{performing}} an acoustic set for The Sun, {{with help from}} a few back-up vocalists and guitarists. Christina Lee of Idolator praised the cover, writing that, [...] "the singer navigated the Michael Jackson-inspired melody with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> of her trademark sass. While Jessie and Breezy sound remarkably different, Jessie J understands pretty well how to treat a Chris Brown song." [...] Brown himself praised her rendition, going to Twitter to give her praise, saying, [...] "you're beyond incredible!".|$|E
2500|$|Torv's {{double duty}} as Olivia and Fauxlivia {{late in the}} second season and {{throughout}} {{the third and fourth}} seasons received almost universal critical acclaim. TV Guide called it one of the best performances of the year, explaining [...] "Switching Olivia with her alternate-universe self... jump-started the show's interpersonal dynamics — and changed the way we look at Torv. Her take on [...] added many new colors to the characters, including malice, humor and sensuality. In a 2010 list, Time Magazines James Poniewozik called Torv's performance one of television's best of the year. He explained, [...] "... in the dual role of Olivia/Fauxlivia, Torv absolutely came into her own this year. While some credit goes to the writing, it was Torv's shaded performance that sold Olivia's alternate-universe twin as an actual separate person—not just a cartoon villain version of the original, but a real person, a little more assertive and confident, and <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> rapacious. Meanwhile, she convincingly portrayed the trauma and confusion of her captured-then-returned Olivia, whose emotional (and complicated) reunion with Peter made an outlandish situation real and moving." ...|$|E
2500|$|The series' horror {{was mostly}} criticized; Henderson {{asserted}} [...] "it isn't really a horror title ... It's {{more of the}} psychological horror", while Wildsmith considered the stories were not [...] "scary enough to make this collection horror, nor are they thought provoking {{enough to make it}} a psychological thriller". Sherman said it [...] "isn't as unsettling as it could be: there are terrors, after all, which reflect the characters' primal fears, yet Esuno doesn't delve as deeply into 'em as he could". Most reviewers agreed it was not that scary, but at least featured [...] "creepy" [...] and [...] "spooky" [...] moments. Santos felt that it [...] "would probably be a lot more horrifying ... if it didn't keep trying to be cute and funny with the characters", especially criticizing Hanako's role who [...] "make annoying quips that derail the creepy mood of the series". Zack Davisson of Japan Reviewed remarked that when it [...] "is playing with straight horror, it really shines" [...] so the second and third volumes were considered an improvement over the first as they relied less on [...] "cheap gags" [...] and [...] "panty-gags" [...] and [...] "deliver some actual horror". Ho also said it has [...] "an incredibly goofy sense of humour", and while Garrity concluded that [...] "promising blend of comedy and horror", the manga [...] "doesn't quite work as comedy or horror", some reviewers appreciated this humor and horror mix. Ed Sizemore of Comics Worth Reading affirmed it is a good reading for those who [...] "like light horror with sense of humor", and Henderson said it is [...] "a light read with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> of the shiver factor".|$|E

Rapinoe would later convert her shot during the penalty shootout to help send the United States to the semifinals. Rapinoe described her last minute cross against Brazil: [...] "I <b>just</b> took <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> and friggin' smacked it with my left foot.

2500|$|Car and Driver on the L-82 in December 1972, “…when {{it comes}} to making a choice, the L82 is the engine we prefer.

And granted, the 454s will squirt through traffic with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> feather <b>touch</b> on the gas pedal. But, to us at least, the small block engine contributes to a fine sense of balance in the Corvette that is rare in any GT car, so rare {{that it would be a}} shame to exchange it for a few lb.-ft. of torque.” ...|$|R

He patted Una's head and cheerily promised to return at dawn. He yawned and smiled at himself. He looked as roundly, fuzzily sleepy as a bunny rabbit, but in the quiet, forlorn room of night and illness he radiated trust in himself. Una said to herself, [...] "He certainly must know what he is talking about." ...|$|R

40|$|Humans can {{distinguish}} many object and surface properties by touch.

In vision, there already exists {{a large body of}} literature concerning salient features (e. g., Itti, 2007). A typical way to investigate visual saliency is by means of a search task (e. g., Treisman and Gelade, 1980; Treisman and Gormican, 1988; Wolfe and Horowitz, 2008). Here, we will describe this search task, its adaptations to haptic research and give an overview of the features that are salient to touch...|$|R
