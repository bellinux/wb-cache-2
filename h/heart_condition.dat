5|$|Coldwell {{suffered}} from a <b>heart</b> <b>condition,</b> and undertook a much less ambitious schedule than the major party leaders. The party leader left Ottawa for his riding, Rosetown—Biggar in Saskatchewan, on April 26, and remained there until May 10. He spent three days campaigning in Ontario, then moved west to the major cities of the prairie provinces and British Columbia, before returning to his riding for the final days before the June 10 election. Other CCF leaders took charge of campaigning in Quebec and the Maritimes.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 2009, {{an adult}} male {{passenger}} {{was rushed to}} a hospital after he was found with breathing problems following the ride. He died the same evening. The Hamilton County Coroner's Office reported that a <b>heart</b> <b>condition</b> was the likely cause of death and ruled it natural. The ride was re-opened at 12:10 pm on August 9, 2009, after an inspection by the Ohio Department of Agriculture – {{a division of the}} state government responsible for amusement park ride safety in Ohio. They determined the ride was operating within the manufacturer's specifications.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday, 5 October 1985, a {{week after}} the Brixton riot, police arrested Floyd Jarrett, a 24-year-old black man from Tottenham, on {{suspicion}} of being in a stolen car. It was a suspicion {{that turned out to be}} groundless, but a decision was made several hours later to search the home of his mother, Cynthia Jarrett, for stolen goods. In the course of the search she collapsed and died of heart failure. Rose writes that the pathologist, Walter Somerville, told the inquest that Mrs Jarrett had a <b>heart</b> <b>condition</b> that meant she probably only had months to live.|$|E

5|$|A <b>heart</b> <b>condition</b> {{uncommon}} to the breed is tetralogy of Fallot, {{which is more}} common in the Keeshond and English Bulldog breeds relatively. It is actually a combination of up to four conditions, including the previously mentioned pulmonary valve stenosis, with a secondary condition of right ventricular hypertrophy. The other conditions are ventricular septal defect which is a defect or hole in the wall of the heart between the two ventricles and the aorta which carries the blood from the left to {{the right side of the}} heart can be mis-positioned. The effect on the dog depends on the severity of the condition, and can range from a heart murmur through to reduced activity levels to death. Symptoms in puppies are generally a failure to grow and a reduced tolerance for exercise. Active treatment is effective in around 50% of cases.|$|E
5|$|Graham confides in Evelyn that he {{is trying}} to find the Indian lover he was forced to abandon as a youth. Social-climber Jean is {{attracted}} to Graham, and makes a rare excursion to follow him, but is humiliated when he explains he is gay. Graham reunites with his former lover, who is in an arranged marriage of mutual trust and respect. Reconciled, the Englishman dies of an existing <b>heart</b> <b>condition.</b> Evelyn and Douglas grow increasingly close, angering his wife, which results in an outburst from Douglas denouncing this marriage. Muriel reveals that she was once housekeeper to a family who had her train her younger replacement and now, having been forced out of the home and into retirement, she feels that she has lost any purpose in her life.|$|E
5|$|Lethbridge's <b>heart</b> <b>condition</b> worsened, to {{the extent}} that he was unable to attend his mother's funeral in 1970. He {{eventually}} required 24-hour care, and was transferred to Nuffield Hospital in Exeter, where he died in his sleep on 30 September 1971. His body was interned at the family plot in Heytesbury, Wiltshire. As the Branscombe house was owned by the Lethbridge Family Trust, Mina was obliged to move out after her husband's death, and she sold his belongings out of financial necessity. Mina also collected together Lethbridge's unfinished book with the help of writer Colin Wilson; together they assembled it into publishable form and it was brought out by Routledge in 1976 as The Power of the Pendulum.|$|E

5|$|Louie Broady Nunn {{was born}} in Park, Kentucky– a small {{community}} {{on the border of}} Barren and Metcalfe counties– on March 8, 1924. His given name, Louie, honored a deceased friend of his father's; his middle name, Broady, was a surname in his mother's family. Louie was the youngest of the four sons born to Waller Harrison and Mary (Roberts) Nunn; their youngest child, Virginia, was their only daughter. The Nunns were farmers and operated a general store, though Waller suffered from a congenital <b>heart</b> <b>condition</b> and severe arthritis and was limited to light chores. The eldest brother, Lee Roy, became an influential campaigner and fundraiser for the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Mughal-e-Azam {{is one of}} {{only two}} films {{directed}} by Asif; one of his unfinished projects was released posthumously as a tribute. Over time the title has become part of Bollywood vernacular, used to describe a project that is taking too long to complete. Art director Omung Kumar, who has designed sets for major Indian films such as Black (2005) and Saawariya (2007), said that he and others in his field look to Mughal-e-Azam as a source of inspiration for art direction. It has also been used {{as a model for the}} perfect love story, requiring directors to ensure lovers overcome obstacles. Following her success in the film, Madhubala could have gone on to land further major roles, but she was advised not to overwork owing to her <b>heart</b> <b>condition,</b> and had to withdraw from some productions that were already underway.|$|E
5|$|An infant with {{a severe}} <b>heart</b> <b>condition</b> is {{admitted}} in neonatology, and is revealed to have been abandoned in a schoolyard by his biological mother, whose identity lies between four pre-adolescents. Montgomery quickly becomes emotionally involved in the case, reliving the feelings she went through after aborting the child conceived with Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane). Shepherd and O'Malley get quarantined after an outburst at the hospital, due to a patient suspected of having the plague. Their incapacity to leave the hospital leads to numerous confessions between the two, including Shepherd's reveal of his desire to divorce his wife and reconcile with Grey. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) takes {{a leave of absence}} from the hospital, in a continuous attempt to bond with the grieving interns, who do not approve of her relationship with O'Malley. When a patient, Giselle Toussant (Elizabeth Goldstein), is admitted to the hospital, and ultimately dies in Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson)'s care, she begins to question her abilities as a surgeon, due to the guilt over the death of both Toussant and Duquette, whom she also performed surgery on. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens overcomes her grief and gets off the floor, which metaphorically expresses her desire to move on.|$|E

5|$|As {{a student}} at Carnegie Mellon University in 2004, Druckmann was tasked with {{creating}} a video game concept to present to film director George A. Romero, who would select a winner. Druckmann's idea was to merge the gameplay of Ico (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968), with a lead character similar to John Hartigan from Sin City (1991–2000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to the lead character's <b>heart</b> <b>condition,</b> players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. Though the idea did not win, Druckmann later developed it when creating the story of The Last of Us. An early idea for the game was that the infection only spread to women, though this was later deemed misogynistic.|$|E
5|$|With Merrick {{admitted}} into the hospital, Treves now {{had time to}} conduct a more thorough examination. He discovered that Merrick's physical condition had deteriorated over {{the previous two years}} and that he had become quite crippled by his deformities. Treves also suspected that Merrick now suffered from a <b>heart</b> <b>condition</b> and that he had only a few years left to live. Merrick's general health improved over the next five months under the care of the hospital staff. Although some nurses were initially upset by his appearance, they overcame this and cared for him. The problem of his unpleasant odour was mitigated through frequent bathing and Treves gradually developed an understanding of Merrick's speech. A new set of photographs was taken. The question of Merrick's long-term care had to be addressed. Francis Carr Gomm, the chairman of the hospital committee, had supported Treves in his decision to admit Merrick, but by November, long-term plans needed to be made. The London Hospital was not equipped or staffed to provide care for the incurable, which Merrick clearly was.|$|E
5|$|Young Como started {{helping his}} family at age 10, working {{before and after}} school in Steve Fragapane's barber shop for 50¢ a week. By age 13, he had {{graduated}} to having his own chair in the Fragapane barber shop, although he stood on a box to tend to his customers. It was also around this time that young Como lost his week's wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, he locked himself in his room and did not come out until hunger {{got the better of}} him. He managed to tell his father {{what had happened to the}} money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled to make a mistake and that he hoped his son would never do anything worse than this. When Perry was 14, his father became unable to work because of a severe <b>heart</b> <b>condition.</b> Como and his brothers became the support of the household.|$|E
50|$|He {{created the}} first {{practical}} ECG machine with surface electrodes. He lectured on it in Europe and America, often using his dog Jimmy in his ECG demonstrations. Initially Waller did not think electrocardiograms would be useful in hospitals. However, eventually other physiologists such as Willem Einthoven and Thomas Lewis showed Waller that the traces could help diagnose <b>heart</b> <b>conditions.</b> In 1917, {{a few years before}} his death, Waller published a study of over 2000 traces of <b>heart</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{cancerous}} patient, Marina Wagner (Amanda Collins), {{is admitted}} {{into the hospital}} and is revealed to have toxic blood - presumably caused by a chemical reaction between an herbal supplement and chemotherapy - making several physicians fall ill. O'Malley is exposed to the neurotoxin, and quickly becomes anxious, fearing that his marriage is the cause of the sickness. Ellis is diagnosed with a <b>heart</b> <b>condition,</b> in which surgery or medication are options. Ellis does not want the surgery, but Meredith fears that she will not be compliant with her medication. Shepherd and Burke try to close up Wagner as the OR was evacuated before her surgery was completed, by entering the operating room with sealed, airtight suits. Ellis agrees to the surgery, but opts to speak with Webber, her former lover. A teenage patient is brought into the clinic by her father, hoping that a doctor can teach her how to use tampons. When her father leaves the room, she explains to Bailey that she had sex, but her pregnancy test is negative. Shepherd and Burke run out of air whilst operating on Wagner, so Yang, Stevens, and Meredith enter holding their breath to close the patient's incision. O'Malley's colleagues act in a rude manner to his new marriage, and displeased, he lectures them, standing up for Torres. Sloan is seen to be having sex with Montgomery, and Yang agrees to marry Burke. At the conclusion of the episode, Ellis' lucidity has vanished, leaving Meredith and Webber distraught.|$|E
