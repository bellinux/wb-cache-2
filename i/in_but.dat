5|$|All {{but two of}} the {{handcart}} companies {{successfully completed}} the rugged journey, with relatively few problems and only a few deaths. However, the fourth and fifth companies, known as the Willie and Martin Companies, respectively, had serious problems. The companies left Iowa City, Iowa, in July 1856, very late to begin the trip across the plains. They met severe winter weather west of present-day Casper, Wyoming, and continued to cope with deep snow and storms {{for the remainder of the}} journey. Food supplies were soon exhausted. Young organized a rescue effort that brought the companies <b>in,</b> <b>but</b> more than 210 of the 980 emigrants in the two parties died.|$|E
5|$|Aveni {{claims that}} another {{building}} {{associated with the}} planet Venus {{in the form of}} Kukulcan, and the rainy season at Chichen Itza is the Caracol. This is a building with circular tower and doors facing the cardinal directions. The base faces the most northerly setting of Venus. Additionally the pillars of a stylobate on the building's upper platform were painted black and red. These are colours associated with Venus as an evening and morning star. However the windows in the tower seem to have been little more than slots, making them poor at letting light <b>in,</b> <b>but</b> providing a suitable place to view out.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{formation}} of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, called the Armée d'Angleterre (Army of England) around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England, and was so confident of success that he had commemorative medals struck to celebrate the conquest of the English. Although they never invaded, Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation. Boredom among the troops occasionally set <b>in,</b> <b>but</b> Napoleon paid many visits and conducted lavish parades in order to boost morale.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, as part {{of urban}} renewal, the city razed about 200 {{buildings}} across 25 city blocks (roughly 40% of downtown), destroying the Gateway District and many buildings with notable architecture, including the Metropolitan Building. Efforts to save the building failed but are credited with sparking interest <b>in</b> (<b>but</b> not always succeeding in) historic preservation in the state.|$|E

He grabs her just as her brother walks <b>in,</b> <b>but</b> Hunsecker, encouraged by Susan's silence, accuses Falco of trying to assault Susan and begins beating the physically weaker Falco. Falco pleads that he only came to the apartment at Hunsecker's request, prompting Hunsecker to tell Falco that he never called him. As Susan stops Hunsecker from further harming him, Falco realizes that Susan placed the call {{in order to bring}} the men to blows.|$|E

However, Yardley opted to not take the ball, and Hassett managed to score a single and get off strike before the English captain called for a replacement ball. O'Reilly said the failure to take the new ball immediately after the appeal was a missed opportunity to maximise the psychological pressure on Hassett.|$|E

Cornfeld had enjoyed Eraserhead and was {{interested}} in producing Ronnie Rocket; Cornfeld was working for Mel Brooks and Brooksfilms at the time, and when the two realized that Ronnie Rocket was unlikely to find sufficient financing to be produced, Lynch asked to see some already-written scripts to work from for his next film instead.

5|$|Robert Wood, the {{engineer}} who {{signed off on}} {{the engineer}}ing report declaring the mall structurally sound just {{a few weeks before the}} roof collapse, was charged with two counts of criminal negligence causing death and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm. According to the inquiry, Wood had previously indicated in conversation that he was aware that the roof was at risk of caving <b>in,</b> <b>but</b> altered his final report at Nazarian's request so that the structural issues did not jeopardize the building's refinancing.

5|$|Similarly to {{the other}} rare-earth metals, {{lutetium}} has no known biological role, but it is found even in humans, concentrating in bones, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the liver and kidneys. Lutetium salts are known to occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature; the element is the least abundant in the human body of all lanthanides. Human diets have not been monitored for lutetium content, so it is not known how much the average human takes <b>in,</b> <b>but</b> estimations show the amount is only about several micrograms per year, all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants. Soluble lutetium salts are mildly toxic, but insoluble ones are not.|$|E

5|$|The fulmarine petrels are generalists, {{which for}} the most part take many species of fish and crustacea.

The diet of the giant petrels varies {{according}} to sex, with the females taking more krill and the males more carrion. All the fulmarine petrels readily feed on fisheries discards at sea, a habit that has been implicated <b>in</b> (<b>but</b> not proved to have caused) the expansion in range of the northern fulmar in the Atlantic.|$|E
