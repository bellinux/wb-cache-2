25|$|In one variant, {{the woman}} may lift and {{slightly}} bend her legs, resting her <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mattress. This shortens {{the distance between}} the vagina and cervix, and may apply more friction to the area termed the G-Spot. The woman may find this more comfortable than the standard position, and it can allow her to push against the man's thrust, giving her some control over the rhythm.|$|E
25|$|A bird Overt ("closed") or close, the bird's {{equivalent}} of Statant, {{is shown in}} profile and at rest with its <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and its wings folded at its sides. Trussed is the term used for domestic or game birds, implying the bird is tied up or caught in a net respectively, and is not applied to predator birds like the Eagle and Hawk. Perched is Overt while sitting atop a Charge.|$|E
25|$|Didelphimorphs have a {{plantigrade}} stance (<b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground) and the hind feet have an opposable digit with no claw. Like some New World monkeys, opossums have prehensile tails. Like all marsupials, the fur {{consists of}} awn hair only, and the females have a pouch. The tail {{and parts of}} the feet bear scutes. The stomach is simple, with a small cecum. Like most marsupials, the male opossum has a forked penis bearing twin glandes.|$|E
50|$|Crepe : When {{a player}} digs the ball by {{extending}} {{his or her}} <b>foot</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, letting the ball bounce {{off the top of}} the foot.|$|R
50|$|A lunge {{can refer}} to any {{position}} {{of the human body}} where one leg is positioned forward with knee bent and <b>foot</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground while the other leg is positioned behind. It is used by athletes in cross-training for sports, by weight-trainers as a fitness exercise, and by yogis as part of an asana regimen.|$|R
5000|$|In dance (particularly ballet), arabesque ( [...] ; literally, [...] "in Arabic fashion") {{is a body}} {{position}} in which a dancer stands <b>on</b> one leg (<b>the</b> supporting leg) with the other leg (the working leg) turned out and extended behind the body, with both legs held straight. In classical ballet, an arabesque can be executed with the supporting leg en pointe or demi pointe or with <b>foot</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor.|$|R
2500|$|A dancer may {{transition}} to en pointe {{by any of}} three possible methods: relevé, sauté or piqué. In the relevé method, the dancer rises smoothly by rotating the foot downward until it reaches a fully extended, vertical orientation, while the toe box remains {{in contact with the}} floor, thus [...] "rolling up" [...] on the foot. This may be done either gradually or rapidly, on one foot or both feet, beginning with <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor or in demi-pointe (heels raised). In the sauté method, the dancer springs up and lands en pointe. In the process, the feet break contact with the floor and the dancer is briefly airborne. To {{transition to}} en pointe via piqué, a dancer will step out directly onto a fully extended, vertical foot. The other foot is then raised from the floor, thereby leaving the dancer en pointe.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{exercises}} {{that can be done to}} strengthen the lower leg. For example, in order to activate plantar flexors in the deep plantar flexors one can sit on the floor with the hips flexed, the ankle neutral with knees fully extended as they alternate pushing their foot against a wall or platform. This kind of exercise is beneficial as it hardly causes any fatigue. [...] Another form of isometric exercise for the gastrocnemius would be seated calf raises which can be done with or without equipment. One can be seated at a table with their <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, and then plantar flex both ankles so that the heels are raised off the floor and the gastrocnemius flexed. An alternate movement could be heel drop exercises with the toes being propped on an elevated surface—as an opposing movement this would improve the range of motion. One-legged toe raises for the gastrocnemius muscle can be performed by holding one dumbbell in one hand while using the other for balance, and then standing with one foot on a plate. The next step would be to plantar flex and keep the knee joint straight or flexed slightly. The triceps surae is contracted during this exercise. Stabilization exercises like the BOSU ball squat are also important especially as they assist in the ankles having to adjust to the ball’s form in order to balance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Glutton {{has several}} names. He is called 'Carcajou' in the Far North, {{and out in}} the Far West is often called 'Skunkbear.' The latter name {{probably}} is given him because in shape and color he looks a good deal as though he might be half Skunk and half Bear. He is about three feet long with a tail six inches long, and is thickset and heavy. His legs are short and very stout. His hair, including that on the tail, is long and shaggy. It is blackish- brown, becoming grayish on {{the upper part of}} his head and cheeks. His feet are black. When he walks he puts his <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground as a Bear does.|$|E
50|$|Keeping one <b>foot</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground {{while trying}} to sleep is one popular {{self-treatment}} for people whose dizziness is exacerbated by lying down with eyes closed. There is no direct scientific evidence to support this treatment, however it is consistent with studies showing that postural balance responses to high and low speed tilts are primarily driven by force and velocity receptors in the muscles with relatively little input from the vestibular system.|$|R
30|$|Since it {{has been}} {{verified}} that the 3 -D permutation test performs as desired {{when it comes to}} both power and Type I error rate, the test will be applied to calcaneocuboid joint data. The data used here were collected by Professor Thomas Greiner, Physical Therapy, at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. Infra-red emitting diodes were attached to the calcaneous and cuboid bones of the foot in a human, baboon, and chimpanzee. Load was applied to the knee while the subjects had their <b>foot</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. The rotation of the calcaneocuboid joint between the two bones was recorded. Although 125 measurements were collected over time as the load was applied, these observations will be assumed to be independent and identically distributed for the purposes of illustration.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "They {{are very}} loosely {{fastened}} in {{his skin and}} come out at the least little pull. New Ones grow {{to take the place}} of those he loses. Notice that he puts his whole <b>foot</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground just as Buster Bear and Bobby Coon do, and just as those two-legged creatures called men do. Very few animals do this, and those that do are said to be plantigrade. Now, Prickly Porky, tell us what you eat and where you make your home, and that will end today's lesson." ...|$|R
60|$|The Orang cannot put its <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, but is {{supported}} upon their outer edges, the heel resting {{more on the}} ground, while the curved toes partly rest upon the ground by the upper side of their first joint, the two outermost toes of each foot completely resting on this surface. The hands are held in the opposite manner, their inner edges serving as the chief support. The fingers are then bent out {{in such a manner}} that their foremost joints, especially those of the two innermost fingers, rest upon the ground by their upper sides, while the point of the free and straight thumb serves as an additional fulcrum.|$|E

50|$|Squat. Stand {{with both}} feet parallel, about shoulder's width apart. Attempting to {{maintain}} the trunk as perpendicular {{as possible to the}} floor, eyes focused ahead, and <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, the subject slowly lowers his body by flexing his knees.|$|E
5000|$|Back {{injuries}} {{have affected}} Couples' career. His swing features an extreme shoulder {{turn at the}} top, which, combined {{with the fact that}} he keeps his left <b>foot</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground throughout the backswing, puts a lot of pressure on his lower back. However, with an abbreviated schedule, Couples is still one of <b>the</b> best players <b>on</b> Tour. In 2003, at age 44, Couples finished 34th <b>on</b> <b>the</b> PGA Tour money list. That year he also won the Shell Houston Open, his first win in five years; Couples wept with joy after the win, but quickly explained the tears, saying: [...] "I'm always emotional when nice things happen to nice people." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{phase is}} one of the most {{technical}} parts of the long jump. Jumpers must be conscious to place <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, because jumping off either the heels or the toes negatively affects the jump. Taking off from the board heel-first has a braking effect, which decreases velocity and strains the joints. Jumping off the toes decreases stability, putting the leg at risk of buckling or collapsing from underneath the jumper. While concentrating <b>on</b> foot placement, <b>the</b> athlete must also work to maintain proper body position, keeping the torso upright and moving the hips forward and up to achieve the maximum distance from board contact to foot release.|$|R
5000|$|... stomp: place <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, lift {{foot off}} floor (no change of weight).|$|R
50|$|Single Knee to chest. Lie on {{your back}} with knees bent and <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. Slowly pull your right knee toward your {{shoulder}} and hold 5 to 10 seconds. Lower the knee and repeat with the other knee.|$|E

50|$|ICF canoe {{marathon}} is an International Canoe Federation governed {{sport in}} which athletes compete over long distances. The race usually starts and {{ends at the}} same place, and includes portages. Race categories vary {{by the number of}} athletes in the boat, the length of the course, and whether the boat is a canoe or Kayak. In a kayak, the paddler is seated in the direction of travel, and uses a double-bladed paddle. In a canoe <b>the</b> paddler kneels <b>on</b> one knee with the other leg forward and <b>foot</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor inside the boat, and paddles a single-bladed paddle on one side only. The World Championships were held every two years from 1988, becoming annual in 1998.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the same}} distance, {{walking with a}} natural heel-first gait burns roughly 70% less energy than running. Differences of this {{magnitude}} are unusual in mammals. Kathyrn Knight of the Journal of Experimental Biology summarizes the findings of one study: [...] "Landing heel first also allows us to transfer more energy from one step to the next to improve our efficiency, while placing <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground reduces the forces around the ankle (generated by the ground pushing against us), which our muscles have to counteract." [...] According to David Carrier of the University of Utah, who helped perform the study, [...] "Given the great distances hunter-gatherers travel, {{it is not surprising}} that humans are economical walkers." ...|$|R

50|$|The saddle height {{should be}} set so that when pedaling, the legs have a slight bend even when the pedals are at their furthest distance. This means that if the saddle height is {{properly}} adjusted, on bikes with traditional geometry, the rider cannot place both <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground when seated on the saddle. If they can, their saddle is too low, unless the bike is a recumbent or other crank-forward design.|$|E
5000|$|The Hubscher {{maneuver}} (or Jack's test) is {{a method}} of evaluating the flexibility of a pes planus or <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> type. The test is performed with the patient weight bearing, with <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, while the clinician dorsiflexes the hallux and watches for an increasing convexity the Arches of the foot. A positive result (arch formation) results from the flatfoot being flexible. A negative result (lack of arch formation) results from the flatfoot being rigid. In a Jack's test, the patient raises the rearfoot off the ground, thus passively dorsiflexing the hallux in Closed Kinetic Chain. This will result in an increase of the arch height in cases of Dynamic (Flexible) <b>Flat</b> <b>Foot.</b> If the deformity is a Static (rigid) <b>Flat</b> <b>foot,</b> {{the height of the}} arch will be unaffected by raising up <b>the</b> heel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forefoot.|$|R
50|$|In {{the last}} stage, the midwife helps the woman stand up. To do this the midwife {{will raise the}} woman's knees so that her <b>feet</b> are <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. The midwife will then take the woman's hands and helps pull her to reach a {{standing}} position. After {{this stage of the}} massage, the woman is instructed to rest.|$|R
50|$|Pelvic tilt. Lie on {{your back}} with knees bent, <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> floor. Flatten <b>the</b> small of your back against the floor, without pushing down with the legs. Hold for 5 to 10 seconds.|$|R
50|$|The {{pulldown}} usually uses {{a weight}} machine {{with a seat}} and brace for the thighs. The starting position involves sitting at the machine with the thighs braced, back straight and <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. The arms are held overhead at full extension, grasping a bar connected to the weight stack. The movement is initiated by pulling the elbows down and back, lowering the bar to the neck, and completed by returning to the initial position.|$|E
5000|$|To {{function}} properly, {{a balance}} bicycle must be small {{enough that the}} rider can walk the bicycle while sitting comfortably in the saddle, putting both <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. The rider first walks the bicycle while standing over the saddle, then while sitting in the saddle. Eventually, the rider feels comfortable enough to run and [...] "scoot" [...] while riding the bicycle, then to lift both {{feet off the ground}} and cruise while balancing on the two wheels.|$|E
5000|$|Handgunners may be {{required}} to shoot from an unsupported standing position (two hands may be used), or from a [...] "freestyle" [...] position. Freestyle includes some unusual positions, such as the Creedmoor position, which is shot lying on the back, legs bent and <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, with the pistol resting on the shooter's right leg. In a freestyle position the pistol may only contact the shooter's body, no rests may be used (not even, {{in the case of the}} Creedmore position, the top of a boot).|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} the Woozy, [...] "for I have no claws. My <b>feet</b> are quite <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom of them. Nor can I gnaw away the boards, as I have no teeth." ...|$|R
30|$|Knee flexion ROM was {{measured}} in accordance with previous literature [9]. Participants adopted a modified kneeling lunge position. The non-dominant leg was positioned with the sole of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor and the knee flexed to 90 °; participants were permitted to place their hands on this knee for support, but were instructed to angle their torso perpendicular to the floor throughout the ROM assessment. With the hip of the dominant leg extended as far as possible, the foam roller was placed under the ankle in order to standardize the starting position. Internal knee angle was recorded, using a goniometer, and then, the knee was flexed as far as voluntarily possible. Maximal knee flexion was held {{only as long as}} was required to measure the internal angle for a second time. Total ROM was taken as the difference between starting knee angle and end knee angle. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between baseline ROM at the start of each trial was 0.85.|$|R
50|$|The first basic {{position}} requires <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> to be <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{floor and}} turned out (pointing {{in opposite directions}} {{as a result of}} rotating the legs at the hips). Heels together, and toes going outwards.|$|R
