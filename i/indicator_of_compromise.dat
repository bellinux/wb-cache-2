Ransomware {{is a kind of}} malware characterized by asking a ransom payment after infecting a device. Firstly they just block the device showing a full screen message until receiving the payment but, in a while, they started using file encryption. Once the files have been encrypted, {{it is virtually impossible to}} decipher them without the decryption key. That leaves only the possibility of ransom to recover lost files. During the investigation about ransomware, we found that the vast majority of them used fixed extensions and patterns to rename encrypted files. Somehow, we could use this feature to identify the encryption process in its initial state and kill it. RaMON is a reactive tool that doesn't require installation and designed to consume very little resources. These characteristics make possible to work together with an antivirus as a light and transparent application. We must remember that RaMON has been designed to fight against a very specific type of malware. For this reason, it should be viewed as an additional security layer and in no way a replacing for an antivirus. RaMON has a blacklist with extensions we consider as IOC (<b>Indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>Compromise).</b> When one of this extensions is detected, a malicious encryption process is taking place. From them, the functionality of the tool follows these steps: - Monitoring File System for detecting creation/rename of new executable files (. exe) - Monitoring creation/rename files with dangerous extensions. - Matching the “Last created EXE’s” list with current process list, in order to find encryption process. - Once found, matches the “Last created EXE’s” list with current process list, in order to find encryption process. After that, it sends a kill signal to it, his sons and threads. - In parallel, disables network interfaces to avoid expansion of the infection. - Sends a shutdown informing the user about the infection. We make this in order to avoid to keep modifying the system, just in case of an eventual forensic analysis. As a last line of defense tool, its performance will only take place if the ransomware has bypassed all other security layers (UAC, execution prevention, antivirus, firewall, etc.). We should note that the computer world in general, and malware in particular, improves at high speed and what is effective today, probably tomorrow will not. The same sources of information serve the blackhat and the whitehat hackers, fueling the fast evolution in the world of security. Most of time we are thinking about improving security applications but sometimes we forget to work hardly in user education, that is always the weakest link in the infection chain...|$|E

The use of enzyme immunoassay for the measurement of corticosteroids in marsupial serum was validated. We found that there was no significant change in serum corticosteroid concentrations in response to either of the changed conditions suggesting that serum corticosteroid concentrations are not reflective of a change in wellbeing. Cortisol was the dominant serum corticosteroid, with concentrations up to 50 times higher than corticosterone.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Recordings {{of blood}} flow {{velocity}} waveform in the ductus venosus (DV) and the umbilical vein (UV) are routinely used {{in order to}} predict the fetal condition in high-risk pregnancies. This study investigates the relationship between pathological blood flow in the two vessels and perinatal outcome. METHODS: High-risk pregnancies (n= 11865) admitted during 1993 - 2011 for blood flow examinations, including recordings of DV pulsatility index for veins (PIV) and UV pulsations, were included. The results were related to perinatal outcome, using the last Doppler examination prior to delivery in analysis. RESULTS: Abnormal DV PIV was observed in 3, 96 %, intra-abdominal UV-pulsations in 1, 3 % and pulsations in the cord in 0, 7 % of the cases. As expected, the rate of UV-pulsations increased with increasing DV PIV z-score. Fetuses with a pathological DV PIV, but without UV pulsations showed no signs <b>of</b> <b>compromise.</b> This was also true for cases with a DV PIV > 4 SD above the mean (53. 7 % had a steady flow in the UV). In contrast, the occurrence of UV-pulsations {{seems to be an}} <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> fetal <b>compromise</b> regardless <b>of</b> level of DV PIV.

40|$|The {{growth in}} the use of {{endoscopy}} to diagnose and treat many gastointestinal disorders, and its central role in cancer screening programs, has led to {{a significant increase in the}} number of procedures performed. This growth, however, has also led to many variations in, among others, the provision of services, the choice of sedative medications and the training of providers. The recognition of the significance of quality in endoscopy has prompted several countries, including Canada, to initiate efforts to adopt nationwide quality improvement programs. The Canadian Association of Gastroenterology formed a committee to review endoscopy and quality with the aim of stimulating improvement. This article focuses specifically on patient safety indicators that were developed at a consensus conference aimed at generating a broad range of recommendations for selected endoscopic procedures, which if adopted, could lead to significant changes in how endoscopy services are provided. INTRODUCTION: The importance <b>of</b> quality <b>indicators</b> has become increasingly recognized in gastrointestinal endoscopy. Patient safety requires the identification and monitoring of occurrences associated with harm or the potential for harm. The identification <b>of</b> relevant <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> safety <b>compromise</b> is, therefore, a critical element that is key to the effective implementation of endoscopy quality improvement programs. OBJECTIVE: To identify key <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> safety <b>compromise</b> in gastrointestinal endoscopy. METHODS: The Canadian Association of Gastroenterology Safety and Quality Indicators in Endoscopy Consensus Group was formed to address issues of quality in endoscopy. A subcommittee was formed to identify key safety indicators. A systematic literature review was undertaken, and articles pertinent to safety in endoscopy were identified and reviewed. All complications and measures used to document safety were recorded. From this, a preliminary list <b>of</b> 16 <b>indicators</b> was compiled and presented to the 35 -person consensus group during a three-day meeting. A revised list of 20 items was subsequently put to the consensus group for vote for inclusion on the final list <b>of</b> safety <b>indicators.</b> Items were retained only if the consensus group highly agreed on their importance. RESULTS: A total <b>of</b> 19 <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> safety <b>compromise</b> were retained and grouped into the three following categories: medication-related – the need for CPR, use of reversal agents, hypoxia, hypotension, hypertension, sedation doses in patients older than 70 years of age, allergic reactions and laryngospasm/bronchospasm; procedure-related early – perforation, immediate postpolypectomy bleeding, need for hospital admission or transfer to emergency department from the gastroenterology unit, instrument impaction, severe persistent abdominal pain requiring evaluation proven to not be perforation; and procedure-related delayed – death within 30 days of procedure, 14 -day unplanned hospitalization, 14 -day unplanned contact with a health provider, gastrointestinal bleeding within 14 days of procedure, infection or symptomatic metabolic complications. CONCLUSIONS: The 19 <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> safety <b>compromise</b> in endoscopy, identified by a rigorous, evidence-based consensus process, provide clear outcomes to be recorded by all facilities as part of their continuing quality improvement programs...|$|R

40|$|Part 3 : FORENSIC TECHNIQUESInternational audienceDynamic link library (DLL) {{injection}} is {{a method}} of forcing a running process to load a DLL into its address space. Malware authors use DLL injection to hide their code while it executes on a system. Due to the large number and variety of DLLs in modern Windows systems, distinguishing a malicious DLL from a legitimate DLL in an arbitrary process is non-trivial and often requires the use <b>of</b> previously-established <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>compromise.</b> Additionally, the DLLs loaded in a process naturally fluctuate over time, adding {{to the difficulty of}} identifying malicious DLLs.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIt {{has been said}} that cyber attackers are attacking at wire speed (very fast), while cyber defenders are defending at human speed (very slow). Researchers have been working to improve this asymmetry by automating a greater portion of what has traditionally been very labor-intensive work. This work is involved in both the monitoring of live system events (to detect attacks), and the review of historical system events (to investigate attacks). One technology that is helping to automate this work is Security Information and Event Management (SIEM). In short, SIEM technology works by aggregating log information, and then sifting through this information looking for event correlations that are highly indicative of attack activity. For example: Administrator successful local logon and (concurrently) Administrator successful remote logon. Such correlations are sometimes referred to as <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>compromise</b> (IOCs).

Here, we compare the prevalence of 4 coral diseases and 8 other <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>compromised</b> coral health at high and low use dive sites around the island of Koh Tao, Thailand. Surveys of 10, 499 corals reveal that the mean prevalence of healthy corals at low use sites (79 %) was twice that at high use sites (45 %). We also found a 3 -fold increase in coral disease prevalence at high use sites, as well as significant increases in sponge overgrowth, physical injury, tissue necrosis from sediment, and non-normally pigmented coral tissues. Injured corals were more susceptible to skeletal eroding band disease only at high use sites, suggesting that additional stressors associated with use intensity facilitate disease development. Sediment necrosis of coral tissues was strongly associated with the prevalence of white syndromes, a devastating group of diseases, across all sites. We did not find significant differences in mean levels of coral growth anomalies or black band disease between high and low use sites. Our results suggest that several <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> coral health increase understanding of impacts associated with rapid tourism development.

40|$|Cyberthreat {{intelligence}} {{is currently a}} hot topic in the information security community. Today’s business models are forcing organizations {{to move into the}} cyberspace, and because of this they phase new threats. Organizations need to address these new threats in order to protect their systems from adversaries. One method for doing so is to develop a threat intelligence program, in which the organization actively gathers intelligence about current and emerging cyberthreats. <b>Indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>compromise</b> can be used in organization’s security infrastructure to look for and to prevent threats in near real-time. Indicators can be obtained from public intelligence feeds, and they can be shared in threat information sharing communities formed by organizations facing similar threats. Regardless of the source of threat intelligence, the intelligence should be evaluated by skilled security analysts to verify that the <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>compromise</b> suit the target environment. By sharing threat information organizations can benefit from security incidents seen by other organizations, and the participants can leverage the actionable intelligence to adjust their defenses before similar threats realize within their own network. Organizations can utilize purpose-built software to manage their threat intelligence. This supports the organization in developing its threat intelligence program. Threat information management platforms aid organizations in managing the quality and richness of threat intelligence and these platforms often come with information sharing capabilities built into the software, enabling organizations to share threat intelligence with each other. Organizations are able to distribute actionable intelligence into their security infrastructure more easily if they use a threat information management platform as the centralized point for managing the organization’s threat intelligence. An example of an integration point is the organization’s security information and event management (SIEM) system, which is often utilized by a security operations center (SOC) to perform analytics on the organization’s log data. When the logs collected by a SIEM system are enriched with actionable intelligence security analysts are likely to see more informed alerts and less false positives. This thesis defines an integration between a threat information management platform and a SIEM. We measure and evaluate how much the integration reduces SOC’s burden of manually importing threat intelligence into their monitoring infrastructure. Two questionnaires with SOC analysts were carried out for this purpose. We also evaluate how much integration fastens the deployment of actionable intelligence for detecting emerging threats. The evaluation is based on security incident ticket data obtained from a production SOC environment. Vain tiivistelmä.

The {{aim of this study}} was to identify whether there is variability in drug release and physical characteristics of different commercially available amiodarone hydrochloride formulations in Australia. METHODS: Four available formulations (innovator Cordarone (COR) and generic products G 1, G 2 and G 3) were tested for drug dissolution, content uniformity, hardness, weight variation, friability and disintegration in accordance with the US Pharmacopeia specifications. KEY FINDINGS: The tested formulations exhibited variable dissolution behaviours: G 1 and G 3 exhibited the fastest dissolution, G 2 dissolution was the slowest and Cordarone showed a medium dissolution. After 3 months' exposure to high temperature (40 +/- 2 degrees C) and relative humidity (75 +/- 5 %), the products exhibited a higher degree of disparity, with drug-release profiles of the generics being markedly different from that of Cordarone. This suggests possible implications on bioequivalence for patients who live in warm/tropical regional areas. Most products met the US Pharmacopeia specifications for drug-content uniformity and other test physical characteristics.

The validity and reliability of the Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire- 2 (BREQ- 2) was tested (Chapter 2) within RA patients via a mixed method approach. In a second study (Chapter 3), hypothesised relationships based on SDT between autonomy support from the important other (s), basic psychological needs, motivation regulations and RA patients’ subjective vitality and self-reported PA was tested via structural equation modelling.

40|$|While {{coral reefs}} are {{increasingly}} threatened worldwide, {{they are also}} increasingly used for recreational activities. Given the environmental and socio-economic significance of coral reefs, understanding the links between human activities and coral health and evaluating the efficacy of marine protected areas (MPAs) as a management regime to prevent further deterioration are critically important. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> coral health at sites inside and outside a newly rezoned MPA framework in the dive tourism hotspot of Koh Tao, Thailand. We found that patterns in the health and diversity of coral communities one year on did not reflect the protected status conferred by newly zoned MPAs, but instead reflected past history of recreational use around the island. Sites characterised as past high-use sites had lower mean percent cover of hard corals overall and of corals in the typically disease- and disturbance-susceptible family Acroporidae, but higher mean cover of species in the more weedy family Agariciidae. Past high use sites also had higher mean prevalence of infectious diseases and other <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>compromised</b> health. Sites within the newly established MPAs are currently subjected to higher levels of environmental and anthropogenic pressures, with sedimentation, algal overgrowth, feeding scars from Drupella snails, and breakage particularly prevalent compared to sites in non-MPA areas. Given the greater prevalence of these factors within protected sites, the capacity of the MPA framework to effectively prevent further deterioration of Koh Tao's reefs is unclear. Nevertheless, our study constitutes a strong baseline for future long-term evaluations of the potential of MPAs to maintain coral health and diversity on highly threatened reefs...|$|R

Tracking the Known (TTK) is the problem of keeping IOCs, in this case regular expressions (regexes), up-to-date with a dynamic adversary. Our framework solves the TTK problem in an automated, cyclic fashion to bracket a previously discovered adversary. This tracking is accomplished through a data-driven approach of self-adapting a given model based on its own detection capabilities. In our initial experiments, we found that the true positive rate (TPR) of the adaptive solution degrades much less significantly over time than the naive solution, suggesting that self-updating the model allows the continued detection of positives (i. e., adversaries). The cost for this performance is in the false positive rate (FPR), which increases over time for the adaptive solution, but remains constant for the naive solution. However, the difference in overall detection performance, as measured by the area under the curve (AUC), between the two methods is negligible. This result suggests that self-updating the model over time should be done in practice to continue to detect known, evolving adversaries.
