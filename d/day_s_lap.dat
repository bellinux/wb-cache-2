This paper gives some seed germination and viability information on Santalum haleakalae Hbd. and S. paniculatum H. & A. both native to Hawaii and Santalum album L. native to Indonesia. Germination was shown to be highly variable: as early as 26 days after sowing for <b>S.</b> album, 75 <b>days</b> for <b>S.</b> paniculatum, and 155 <b>days</b> for <b>S.</b> haleakalae. Seed viability varied from 324 <b>days</b> in <b>S.</b> album, 387 <b>days</b> in <b>S.</b> haleakalae and 824 <b>days</b> in <b>S.</b> paniculatum.
