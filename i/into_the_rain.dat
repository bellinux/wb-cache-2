5|$|Charging outside, Mulder is {{attacked}} by the creature in the hall. When he returns with the welts all over his throat, George Vincent slams the door and takes them all hostage, leaving Mulder {{to die in the}} hallway. Angela goes into labor and Scully finds herself forced to deliver a baby. However, water collects in the light fixture above them and the creature appears. It grabs George Vincent by the neck. Scully tells Walter Suarez to aim for the sprinklers, realizing that the freshwater kept the creature at bay, as with the deputy until Epsom salt was added to the water. Suarez shoots the sprinklers and saves Vincent's life. Meanwhile, Mulder realizes that freshwater is the key also, and runs out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> to heal his wounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} quickly pulled after its release because it {{contained}} some technical errors. The clips {{of the people}} on Carey's television had their struggles captioned in dark text on a dark background, making it difficult to read. There were also continuity errors during the rainy balcony scene, as Carey's shirt would alternate between being soaking wet and dry. Consequently, a new music video was completed, which retained the clips of Carey's fans at the beginning but fixed the captions and replaced most of the interior shots of Carey with new footage. Carey, now in a new and more furnished apartment, does not go out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> but instead stays in her living room. She walks over to a large pair of windows aside a mural of large throw pillows and candles, singing and flailing her arms as she completes the song. As with the previous filming of the video, Carey's pain and sadness is resolved with a rainbow, shown {{at the end of the}} video.|$|E
25|$|Some moved eastward {{into the}} hills, where they cleared forests {{in order to}} plant crops. Soil erosion forced them, however, to abandon their land and move deeper into the rainforest. Cattle ranchers then claimed the {{abandoned}} land. Peasants and ranchers continued this movement deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> forest. By the early 1970s, Nicaragua had become the United States' top beef supplier. The beef supported fast-food chains and pet food production. President Anastasio Somoza Debayle owned the largest slaughterhouse in Nicaragua, as well as six meat-packing plants in Miami, Florida.|$|E

50|$|On December 1 and 2 heavy <b>rain</b> fell in <b>the</b> British Isles, and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night, <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> band hit <b>the</b> {{cold air}} {{and turned to}} snow giving about 1 foot (30 cm) on some hilltops and {{mountains}} across Scotland.|$|R
25|$|Locust swarms {{fly with}} the wind at roughly {{the speed of the}} wind. They can cover from 100 to 200 {{kilometers}} in a day, and will fly up to about 2,000 meters above sea level (thereafter, it becomes too cold). Therefore, swarms cannot cross tall mountain ranges such as the Atlas, the Hindu Kush or the Himalayas. They will not venture <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> forests of Africa nor into central Europe. However, locust adults and swarms regularly cross the Red Sea between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and are even reported to have crossed the Atlantic Ocean from Africa to the Caribbean in ten days during the 1987-89 plague. A single swarm can cover up to 1200 square kilometers and can contain between 40 and 80 million locusts per square kilometer (a total of around 50 to 100 billion locusts per swarm, representing 100,000 to 200,000 tons, considering an average mass of 2 grams per cricket). The locust can live between three and six months, and there is a ten to 16-fold increase in locust numbers {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E
500|$|Payment of the {{entrance}} fees, renting of the facilities, and hiring of guides, cooks, and porters are handled at either the park headquarters in Andapa or the Park Visitor Center in Manantenina, which is along the main Andapa-Sambava road, [...] from Sambava and [...] from Andapa. [...] The park has a single trail that leads from the information center in Manantenina to the highest peak. [...] The path <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> forest {{is divided into three}} treks that vary in length and lead to each of the three main camps, each of which is situated at different altitudes and offer views of their own distinctive flora and fauna.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} day Peter discovers that his photographs have not developed properly, {{but is still}} {{able to identify the}} man he fought as Max. He meets with Dr. Connors, Eddie, and Gwen to seek a way to contain Max, who has meanwhile been attacked by the police and has decided to seek help from the lab. On arrival, though, Max becomes aggressive and threatens Connors's wife, Martha. Eddie distracts him long enough for Peter to lead the girls to safety and return as Spider-Man: Max, declaring himself [...] "Electro," [...] begins to fight with Spider-Man. The battle leads the pair out from the lab <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain,</b> where Spider-Man spots a radio tower beside a pool: he knocks Electro into the water, causing him to short circuit into unconsciousness.|$|E

2500|$|The camera obscura {{principle}} {{is not limited}} to eyes, or even lenses, but works with a small hole, or aperture, and any darkened space of whatever size or shape. In modern times, camera obscuras have been fashioned from shoeboxes, oatmeal boxes, soda cans, cookie containers, seashells, eggshells, refrigerators, tents, trucks, airplane hangars, and even hollowed out forms of snow and dirt. A camera obscura can also be produced by a small hole in a roof, wall, or window-shutter through which the view of the outside is projected onto a wall inside a darkened room. [...] Biologist Donald Perry went on an expedition <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> forest of Costa Rica where he climbed into the cavity of a large hollow tree, and discovered a small hole that projected an upside-down image of the outside world onto the opposite interior wall of the trunk. [...] This sort of experience is available across time.|$|E

5000|$|Questions {{over the}} venue {{remained}} {{at the start of}} the following years race, which started in heavy rain with fears of a repeated [...] "mudfest", however despite heavy <b>rain</b> at <b>the</b> start of <b>the</b> race continuing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> evening <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> cleared overnight to provide a dry and sunny end to the race.|$|R
6000|$|The thunder died away, <b>the</b> wind sank <b>into</b> silence, <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> ceased, and <b>the</b> parting clouds {{exhibited}} the glittering crescent {{of the young}} moon. A sonorous and majestic voice sounded from the skies:-- ...|$|R

50|$|Developing rain shafts {{often have}} a fuzzy, bulbous {{appearance}} as they descend.

60|$|The {{cold and}} damp struck through <b>into</b> <b>the</b> alien's heart. It seemed to prophesy his dark future. He {{sat at his}} desk and looked out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gray <b>rain</b> with gloomy eyes-a {{prisoner}} when he had expected to be free.|$|R
25|$|Malaysia is a megadiverse country, with a {{high number}} of species and high levels of endemism. These forests contain the Rafflesia, the largest flower in the world.

60|$|A tall, good-natured {{man stood}} in the lean-to, peering out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain.</b> He watched Dave's {{approach}} with interest. He looked to be what he was, a camp-cook and general worker.|$|E
60|$|Forward he pitched, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> and the inky darkness, {{not knowing}} in what {{direction}} and just then caring but little. His one {{idea was to}} put distance between himself and his pursuers.|$|E
