5|$|A very {{occasional}} off spinner, Brown took 4/16 {{against the}} South of England in his only <b>first-class</b> bowling assignment of the tour. It {{was his best}} career bowling figureshe accumulated only six wickets in his <b>first-class</b> career. He also took 18 catches in the <b>first-class</b> fixtures.|$|E
5|$|Peel {{made two}} further <b>first-class</b> {{appearances}} in 1897 after his suspension by Yorkshire. He played in two end-of-season festival games at Hastings, {{first for the}} North against the South and then for the Players against the Gentlemen, but did little with bat or ball. In all <b>first-class</b> games that year he took 72 wickets at 19.51 and scored 566 runs at 22.64. His only other appearances in <b>first-class</b> cricket came in 1899, when he played for A. J. Webbe's XI against Oxford University and for an England XI against the touring Australians. He ended his <b>first-class</b> career with 12,191 <b>first-class</b> runs {{at an average of}} 19.44 and 1,775 wickets at 16.20.|$|E
5|$|After his {{retirement}} as a player, Harvey took up umpiring. His initial <b>first-class</b> match was in 197475, when he officiated in Queensland’s home match against Victoria {{late in the}} season; {{at the time the}} host team provided both umpires. The following year, he was selected for four <b>first-class</b> matches, one of which was against the touring West Indies. He also officiated in his first List A match, presiding over the final of Australia's domestic limited-overs tournament, which Queensland hosted against Western Australia. The following two seasons were similar; Harvey stood in four <b>first-class</b> matches including one against a touring international team, and one List A match, both of which were quarter-finals.|$|E
5|$|Ahsan played 49 <b>first-class</b> matches for Pakistan, Karachi, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Rawalpindi Peshawar {{and other}} teams between 1955 and 1963. During his <b>first-class</b> career, he {{achieved}} {{five or more}} wickets in an innings on thirteen occasions, and ten or more wickets in a match two times.|$|E
5|$|All Concorde {{seats were}} <b>first-class.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{the four}} {{brothers}} all played for Victoria, {{there was not}} a great deal of overlap in their careers at <b>first-class</b> level, due to a combination of age, interstate moves, international duty and omissions from the team. The most Harveys in one <b>first-class</b> team occurred twice in 1947-48, when Merv, Ray and Neil all played for Victoria in successive Shield matches.|$|E
5|$|An inept batsman with {{an average}} of 5.78 in his <b>first-class</b> career, Toshack managed a Test average of 51.00 on the 1948 tour after being {{dismissed}} only once, behind only Arthur Morris, Sid Barnes, Bradman and Neil Harvey. The unbeaten 20 he managed in the Lord's Test was his best <b>first-class</b> score, made in a freewheeling tenth-wicket stand with Johnston.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Brian Lara, Ponsford is {{the only}} man to twice score 400 runs in a <b>first-class</b> innings and along with Bradman and Wally Hammond, he remains {{one of only three}} men to have scored four triple-centuries. His 437 against Queensland is, as at 2009, still the fifth highest score in <b>first-class</b> cricket.|$|E
5|$|Bradman rotated the two glovemen {{during the}} tour, and Saggers played in 17 of the 31 <b>first-class</b> matches, taking 23 catches and 20 stumpings. Due to Australia's {{powerful}} batting line-up, Saggers had few opportunities with the bat, scoring 209 runs {{at an average}} of 23.22, including his only century at <b>first-class</b> level, 104 not out against Essex.|$|E
5|$|Brian Langford {{holds the}} record for the {{greatest}} number of <b>first-class</b> appearances for Somerset. Between 1953 and 1974 the right-arm off break bowler played 504 times for the club. Only three other players have made more than 400 appearances for Somerset, and no-one has reached the milestone since Langford. Jack White, one of the three, is the club's leading wicket-taker in <b>first-class</b> cricket, claiming 2,165 dismissals for the county between 1909 and 1937. Harold Gimblett's tally of 21,142 <b>first-class</b> runs is the most by a Somerset cricketer, over 2,000 more than the next, Marcus Trescothick.|$|E
5|$|Craig {{signed off}} on his <b>first-class</b> career {{at the end of}} the season with a tour of New Zealand with an International XI. He played in three matches and ended with 240 runs at 48.00; in his final match, against the Cricket Club of India President's XI, he made 101, his 15th century at <b>first-class</b> level.|$|E
5|$|Dewhurst {{made his}} <b>first-class</b> debut for Trinidad in 1920, playing two matches against Barbados. The {{following}} season, he played {{twice in the}} Inter-Colonial Tournament, and also played both games in 1922. In {{the final of the}} latter tournament, he scored 58, his maiden <b>first-class</b> half-century and only his second score in double figures.|$|E
5|$|During the 1925 Hastings Festival, Jack Hobbs scored 266, in a Gents v Players match; {{this was}} his record <b>first-class</b> score, and was also his 15th <b>first-class</b> century in the season, a new record. At the 1947 Hastings Festival, Denis Compton broke Hobbs' record by scoring a 17th <b>first-class</b> century of the season, in a match against South Africa. Compton was {{eventually}} dismissed for 101, although South Africa won the match by 9 wickets. In 1948, Don Bradman scored his 115th <b>first-class</b> century in a Hastings Festival match against a South of England team; his innings lasted 133 minutes.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, Johnston had few {{opportunities}} with the bat, invariably batting at either No. 10 and No. 11 alongside Toshack, another tail-ender with little batting ability.N- Neither player ever passed 30 in their <b>first-class</b> career, {{and they were}} the only two Australians who failed to pass 50 during the tour. As Australia's other frontline bowlers were Miller, Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, all of whom scored centuries and more than 20 fifties each during their <b>first-class</b> career, Toshack and Johnston were rooted {{at the bottom of the}} batting order. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings many time due to their batting strength, Johnston only had 18 innings in his 21 <b>first-class</b> fixtures and scored 188 runs at 18.80, the third lowest average and aggregate. He scored 62 runs in the Tests at 20.66, including his highest <b>first-class</b> score of 29 in the Second Test at Lord’s.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, Tallon had few {{opportunities}} with the bat, generally batting between No. 8 and No. 9,N- because Australia's frontline bowlers included {{the likes of}} Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, who were all capable with the bat. Lindwall scored two Test centuries in his career, while McCool scored 18 <b>first-class</b> centuries, including one in Tests. Johnson and Ring both scored more than 20 fifties at <b>first-class</b> level. As Australia often won by an innings, and often declared in the first innings, Tallon only had 13 innings in his 14 <b>first-class</b> fixtures and was not out two times as {{he ran out of}} partners.|$|E
5|$|<b>First-class</b> cricket {{was first}} played in South Africa in the {{previous}} 1888–89 season, when Robert Warton managed a side which toured the country, playing against representative teams {{from each of the}} provinces, and two matches against South Africa, which were later adjudged to have Test cricket status. During that tour, Donald Currie donated the Currie Cup to be awarded to the team which performed best against the touring side; which was judged to be Kimberley. In other <b>first-class</b> matches during the 1889–90 season, Kimberley faced Natal twice, winning both matches. Transvaal did not play any <b>first-class</b> cricket prior to their Currie Cup contest with Kimberley.|$|E
5|$|Fothergill's two Test {{appearances}} {{were the}} only ones of his career, and were also his final <b>first-class</b> matches. In all, he took 119 <b>first-class</b> wickets at an average of 18.18. His highest score was the 74 runs he scored on his debut.|$|E
5|$|From the 1885 season, all of Newton's <b>first-class</b> {{appearances}} {{were made}} for either Middlesex or the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's in St John's Wood, London. Having {{been a member of}} the MCC since 1878, Newton made his debut for the club in <b>first-class</b> competition against Nottinghamshire in May 1885. He appeared for the club five times during 1885. In contrast to his time at Somerset, he did not restrict himself to playing only during late-July and August. Playing for the side against Lancashire, Newton made his highest total in <b>first-class</b> cricket, scoring 86 in the second-innings of the match. This score was the only half-century that Newton scored for a side other than Somerset. Newton appeared three times for Middlesex during 1885, for whom he qualified under the residential criterion. He averaged 5.33 for the county with the bat, and did not appear again after 1885. He appeared once for the MCC in <b>first-class</b> cricket in each of the 1887, 1888, 1889 and 1890 seasons, after which he did not play <b>first-class</b> cricket again. His final <b>first-class</b> match was in May 1890 when he scored 1 and 21 during a seven wicket loss to Lancashire.|$|E
5|$|Grace {{comments}} {{in his memoirs}} that {{he was glad to}} make his hundredth century at Gloucestershire's ground. Excluding the two centuries not considered <b>first-class</b> by some modern statisticians, Grace's hundredth century came later in the same month when he scored 169 for Gloucestershire against Middlesex at Lord's. He scored his final <b>first-class</b> century in July 1904 for London County, reaching 166 against the Marylebone Cricket Club. He played <b>first-class</b> cricket for another four seasons, and scored 15 and 25 for the Gentlemen of England in his final outing, an innings defeat against Surrey.|$|E
5|$|Harvey had {{his best}} <b>first-class</b> season in 195051, scoring 490 runs at 37.69, {{including}} his maiden <b>first-class</b> century against a full-strength New South Wales team with several Test bowlers. However, he struggled the following season and was dropped, {{and did not}} play a single <b>first-class</b> match in 195253. Recalled the following season, he overcame a slow start to score two centuries later in the summer to end with 421 runs at 38.27 for the summer. After a poor season, Harvey was dropped late in the 195556 season.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{was dropped}} after two matches in 195657, ending his <b>first-class</b> career. After his playing career was over, Harvey took up umpiring, {{and made his}} <b>first-class</b> debut in 197475. He became a regular {{official}} {{over the next few}} seasons and then broke into international umpiring in 197879. In that summer, Harvey stood in two One Day Internationals (ODIs) and one Test. The following season he made his final appearances at international level, presiding over another Test and four ODIs. His last season of top-level domestic umpiring was in 198182 during which he officiated in two matches. He finished his career having presided over 31 <b>first-class</b> and 13 List A matches.|$|E
5|$|Hassett {{made one}} final <b>first-class</b> {{appearance}} upon returning to Australia, in a testimonial match against Morris's XI. He made 126 {{in the first}} innings, his final century, but could manage only three in the second as his team went down by 121 runs. Nevertheless, the match sent him into retirement ₤5,503 wealthier, and with more <b>first-class</b> centuries than any Australian except Bradman.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} <b>first-class</b> cricket debut against South Australia in 1909–1910 and was disappointing, scoring three and one and taking 1/35. He played one further {{match for the}} season, against Victoria. For the next two seasons, his {{opportunities}} at <b>first-class</b> level were limited {{but he managed to}} play against the touring South African and English sides.|$|E
5|$|He played five <b>first-class</b> matches for the university, all in 1876. His highest score {{during these}} matches was the 33 not {{out that he}} scored in the second innings of his <b>first-class</b> debut, against an England XI. He was awarded his cricketing Blue, scoring seven runs at number ten during a nine wicket Cambridge victory over Oxford University.|$|E
5|$|His <b>first-class</b> {{career was}} {{confined}} to his university years, when he appeared for both Oxford and Somerset. Close {{to the top of}} the bowling averages for both teams in each season, his 62 <b>first-class</b> wickets in 1885 placed him among the 20 most prolific wicket-takers in the country. Somerset's temporary loss of <b>first-class</b> status in 1885 brought a premature end to Bastard's <b>first-class</b> career when he was 23. Although he continued to play for the side in second-class cricket until 1889, by the time Somerset resumed <b>first-class</b> cricket in 1891, Bastard had lost his place following the emergence of Sammy Woods and the acquisitions of Ted Tyler and George Nichols. He died at the age of 39 while engaged in scholastic work in Taunton.|$|E

5|$|In 194142, McCabe {{played his}} final <b>first-class</b> match. He scored 8 and 41 as Queensland took a 17-run win. Ten days later, the Japanese {{attacked}} Pearl Harbor, prompting {{the start of}} the war in the Pacific. With that, <b>first-class</b> cricket was cancelled and did not resume until 194546, ending McCabe's career at the age of just 31. He had 24 wins and four losses in 38 <b>first-class</b> matches as captain for all teams. In his last three seasons, McCabe took only one wicket, from 18 overs of bowling.|$|E
5|$|In 1950-51, he hit 490 runs at {{an average}} of 37.69, {{including}} 100 not out against New South Wales at the SCG. However, he struggled the following season and was dropped, and did not play a single <b>first-class</b> match in 1952-53. His only other <b>first-class</b> centuries came in 195354: 102 against South Australia and 111 against Western Australia. He struggled in the following two summers and could not hold a consistent position in the team, and retired. Altogether, he made 1,716 <b>first-class</b> runs (mostly as an opener) in 37 matches {{at an average}} of 27.23. A regular choice for the Queensland baseball team, Harvey later turned to cricket umpiring. His initial <b>first-class</b> match as an umpire was in 1974-75 and he stood in two Tests from 1979 to 1980 after many players and officials left for the breakaway World Series Cricket. He stood in six One Day Internationals including one of the finals of the inaugural World Series Cup. In all, he officiated in 31 <b>first-class</b> and 13 List A matches.|$|E
5|$|In 1955-56, Ray was {{overlooked}} {{and spent}} four years out of <b>first-class</b> cricket, and he never played alongside Neil again at <b>first-class</b> level. Neil played in all of Victoria's matches, and Mick played in Queensland’s first six matches before being dropped for the second and final match against Victoria. In 1956-57, Mick played in two matches for Queensland {{earlier in the season}} before being dropped and retiring; neither were against Victoria, so none of the brothers played together in one match. Ray was recalled to the Victorian team {{in the latter half of}} the 1958-59 season. By this time, Neil had moved to New South Wales for employment reasons, and played each other late in the season. The Harvey brothers never played together or against one another again at <b>first-class</b> level. In 1959-60, Neil was in the Indian subcontinent representing Australia as Ray played his final <b>first-class</b> season before retiring.|$|E
5|$|In all <b>first-class</b> cricket in 1921, Rhodes scored 1,474 runs at {{an average}} of 39.83. This {{included}} his highest <b>first-class</b> score of 267 not out against Leicestershire, struck on the day England began the second Test, having just dropped Rhodes. Rhodes took 141 wickets in the season, {{at an average}} of 13.27. In the autumn, he travelled to India, coaching and playing for the Maharaja of Patiala's private team; Rhodes repeated this trip every year until 1927, sometimes accompanied by other players. On five occasions in India he completed a 1,000 runs and 100 wickets double, although most of these games were not <b>first-class.</b>|$|E
5|$|In all, Roe played 83 <b>first-class</b> matches, {{alongside}} {{a significant number}} of second-class county matches for Somerset. In <b>first-class</b> cricket he scored 2,690 runs, including four centuries, at an average of 20.22. He also took 32 wickets with his medium pace and spin bowling, and was well-regarded as a fielder, having taken 35 catches.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>first-class</b> {{season of}} 1940–41, with the {{proposed}} England tour and the Sheffield Shield competition both cancelled {{because of the}} war, Ring played half a dozen <b>first-class</b> matches for Victoria, achieving little with his bowling, but making 72 when promoted to No 3 batsman as a nightwatchman against South Australia at Adelaide and following that up with 60 against Queensland at Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm Robert Jardine (8 June 1869– 16 January 1947) was an English <b>first-class</b> cricketer {{who played}} 46 matches, mainly for Oxford University. Although his <b>first-class</b> record was not impressive, he scored 140 in the University Match of 1892 using an unorthodox batting method. He played a few matches for Middlesex but later {{went to work}} in India, in effect ending his English <b>first-class</b> career. He played <b>first-class</b> cricket in India for the Europeans and after a {{successful}} legal career, returned to England. His son Douglas went on to play cricket for Oxford, Surrey and England, captaining the latter two and being {{associated with the use of}} Bodyline bowling.|$|E
5|$|Malik played 49 <b>first-class</b> matches for Karachi, Punjab, Rawalpindi and Services teams during 1956–66. During his <b>first-class</b> career, he {{achieved}} {{five or more}} wickets in an innings on fourteen occasions, and ten or more wickets in a match four times.|$|E
5|$|Marsh {{was again}} {{overlooked}} for selection during the 1902–03 Sheffield Shield season. He played his only <b>first-class</b> match {{of the season}} against Queensland, in another one-off match. In the last <b>first-class</b> fixture of his career, Marsh scored his highest <b>first-class</b> score of nine not out as New South Wales were bowled out for 191. He then took 2/39 in the first innings as New South Wales took a 60-run first innings lead. He finished his career with 3/23 in the second innings, including a final burst of 3/0, to help his team to a victory. Later in the season, Marsh played in a match for New South Wales against Australia, which was not <b>first-class.</b> He took the wicket of Clem Hill as the match ended in a draw.|$|E
5|$|Michael Burns (born 6 February 1969) is an English <b>first-class</b> list cricket umpire {{and former}} <b>first-class</b> cricketer who played county cricket for Warwickshire and Somerset in a <b>first-class</b> career which spanned from 1992 until 2005. He also played Minor Counties cricket for Cumberland and Cornwall. An {{adaptable}} cricketer, he appeared for Cumberland and Warwickshire as a wicket-keeper, {{but when he}} moved to Somerset he developed into an aggressive batsman who bowled at medium-pace when needed.|$|E
