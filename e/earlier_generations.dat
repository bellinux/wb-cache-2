25|$|The {{nuances of}} playing the {{instrument}} are handed down from generation to generation, but the old rhythms are undergoing changes. The rhythm is no longer as slow as in <b>earlier</b> <b>generations.</b> Nowadays, dhakis opt for faster rhythms. Earlier, different beats were used for specific aspects of Durga Puja, as for example chokhhu daan (eye presentation), patha bali (goat sacrifice), bisarjan (immersion ceremony), sandhya arati (evening offerings), sandhipuja (worshiping at the conjunction of two phases), and so on.|$|E
25|$|In {{even earlier}} {{versions}} of the legendarium, {{there were only two}} Houses of Men: of Bëor and Hador, the latter afterwards separated in two. The leader of the Second House became Haleth the Hunter (great-grandfather of Brandir), his people called both House of Haleth and Folk of Haleth (or Halethrim) and described as alike to the House of Hador rather than Bëor; and these conceptions were still present until the vast expansion into <b>earlier</b> <b>generations</b> took place after the writing of The Lord of the Rings.|$|E
25|$|Development {{of a third}} {{generation}} protective fabrics started in 1992 under the name Avertic. By using a new combination of settings, materials and finishing, this new generation of protective textiles enhanced not only the washability of garments but also the level of protection compared to <b>earlier</b> <b>generations.</b> Thanks to Kjell Eng´s innovative mind, Avertic chainsaw protective textiles are still used in chaps, trousers, boots, jackets and gloves around the world. In the spirit of Kjell Eng the manufacturers of PPE strive daily to invent better protection for workers in the forestry and logging industry.|$|E

25|$|The Hanseatic League {{promoted}} trade {{throughout the}} Baltic Sea aboard cogs and hulks that mariners propelled with square sails and oars. The pious European population – especially the monasteries, convents, and bishops – demanded enormous quantities of fish, and Dutch, English, other British, Breton and Basque mariners sought suitable fishing grounds. <b>Earlier</b> <b>generations</b> of Europeans frequently fished in Norwegian waters {{and in the}} North Sea; however, the cooling climate led to {{the decline of the}} former fisheries, and the reduced supply in the latter could not satiate the increasing demand for salted cod, herring, and other fish.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the Forcade-Biaix branch is {{complicated}} by the publication of false information concerning its origins in several affluent publications on the topic of nobility in Prussia and Europe. The first known publication of such information was in 1767, about 80 years after immigration in Prussia. The same information was reproduced in various forms in publications {{during the first half of}} the 19th century. One can only speculate if the information was knowingly furnished as false, or if it was the innocent result of confusing names that had been handed down verbally from two <b>earlier</b> <b>generations</b> already deceased. Claims published in the same publications that they held the rank of Marquis were, however, deliberately false.|$|E
40|$|<b>Early</b> <b>generation</b> {{stability}} of a japonica rice variety, 84 - 15, was retested {{by using the}} allelic differences of two qualitative traits, i. e., glume tip color and waxy endosperm. Results showed that both glume tip color and waxy endosperm segregated in progenies of single F 1 plants derived from two crosses of 84 - 15 /Zi 18 (purple color) and 84 - 15 /Dahuaxiangnuo (waxy). The results denied the conclusion obtained in previous studies that 84 - 15 had a characteristic of <b>early</b> <b>generation</b> stability. Moreover, {{it was found that}} using the coefficient of variation as an indicator of <b>early</b> <b>generation</b> stability was unreasonable by analyzing plant height as an example. Importance of avoiding systematic error in research works was also discussed...|$|R

25|$|A 2010 {{review of}} {{published}} scientific research suggested that exercise generally improves sleep for most people, and helps sleep {{disorders such as}} insomnia. The optimum time to exercise may be 4 to 8 hours before bedtime, though exercise {{at any time of}} day is beneficial, with the exception of heavy exercise taken shortly before bedtime, which may disturb sleep. However, there is insufficient evidence to draw detailed conclusions about the relationship between exercise and sleep. Sleeping medications such as Ambien and Lunesta are an increasingly popular treatment for insomnia. Although these nonbenzodiazepine medications are generally believed to be better and safer than <b>earlier</b> <b>generations</b> of sedatives, they have still generated some controversy and discussion regarding side-effects. White noise appears to be a promising treatment for insomnia.|$|E
25|$|Giddens {{concentrates}} on a contrast between traditional (pre-modern) culture and post-traditional (modern) culture. In traditional societies, individual actions {{need not be}} extensively thought about, because available choices are already determined (by the customs, traditions, etc.). In contrast, in post-traditional society people (actors, agents) are much less concerned with the precedents set by <b>earlier</b> <b>generations,</b> and they have more choices, due to flexibility of law and public opinion. This however means that individual actions now require more analysis and thought before they are taken. Society is more reflexive and aware, something Giddens is fascinated with, illustrating it with examples ranging from state governance to intimate relationships. Giddens examines three realms in particular: the experience of identity, connections of intimacy and political institutions.|$|E
25|$|So proto-insects had to {{specialize}} and focus their whole existence on improving a single lifestyle {{in a particular}} niche. The older the species and the single individuals became, the more would they differ from their original form as they adapted to their new lifestyles better than the generations before. The final body-structure was no longer achieved while still inside the egg, but continued to develop for most of a lifetime, causing a bigger difference between the youngest and oldest individuals. Assuming that mature individuals most likely mastered their new element better than did the nymphs who had the same lifestyle, it {{would appear to be}} an advantage if the immature members of the species reached adult shape and form as soon as possible. This may explain why they evolved fewer but more intense instars and a stronger focus on the adult body, and with greater differences between the adults and the first instars, instead of just gradually growing bigger as <b>earlier</b> <b>generations</b> had done. This evolutionary trend explains how they went from ametabolous to hemimetabolous insects.|$|E

500|$|Maria Tatar in The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales (2002) {{notes that}} Southey's tale is {{sometimes}} {{viewed as a}} cautionary tale that imparts a lesson about the hazards of wandering off and exploring unknown territory. Like [...] "The Tale of the Three Little Pigs", the story uses repetitive formulas to engage the child's attention and to reinforce the point about safety and shelter. Tatar {{points out that the}} tale is typically framed today as a discovery of what is [...] "just right", but for <b>earlier</b> <b>generations,</b> it was a tale about an intruder who could not control herself when encountering the possessions of others.|$|E
500|$|This lack {{of convincing}} early {{evidence}} {{is the reason}} many recent historians exclude Arthur from their accounts of sub-Roman Britain. In the view of historian Thomas Charles-Edwards, [...] "at {{this stage of the}} enquiry, one can only say that there may well have been an historical Arthur [...] the historian can as yet say nothing of value about him". These modern admissions of ignorance are a relatively recent trend; <b>earlier</b> <b>generations</b> of historians were less sceptical. The historian John Morris made the putative reign of Arthur the organising principle of his history of sub-Roman Britain and Ireland, The Age of Arthur (1973). Even so, he found little to say about a historical Arthur.|$|E
