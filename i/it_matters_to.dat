2500|$|Magnifying the {{controversy}} {{of the race}} was {{a decision by the}} Washington Post to delay until after the election coverage of its year-long investigation into detailed claims of sexual abuse and assault made by 10 women against Packwood.

This led to a joke, [...] "If <b>it</b> <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> Oregonians, it's in the Washington Post (a twist on the Oregonian's slogan, [...] "If <b>it</b> <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> Oregonians, it's in the Oregonian.") The paper's editor would later admit to having been less than aggressive in pursuing the story due to concerns about [...] "â€¦ruining a man's career." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1989, Swayze said, [...] "I've {{always felt}} there was {{something}} different in there (my personality), but I was scared to look. For I fear I wouldn't find anything. That's the reason I got into Buddhism, took EST training, was into therapy, into Scientology, into Transcendental Meditation. I was trying to support that side of myself.
