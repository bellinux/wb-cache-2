5|$|The {{stress of}} {{maintaining}} a career and a household {{can also lead to}} a loss of sleep. In traditional gender roles it is usually the mother who is the one to get the family going in the morning as she fixes breakfast and takes the children to school before she goes to her own job. At night the mother cooks and does various other activities around the house that cause her to be the last person to retire for the night as well. Although this is merely just a few gender roles that are not set in stone, they may hold to be true. It was found that working women sleep twenty-five minutes less a night due solely to their responsibility for domestic work. Applying this statistic in larger scale leads to the assumption that women on average lose up to thirteen <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> per month due to domestic duties. It can be assumed that it is possible for an average woman to lose up to one hundred and fifty-six <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> during a year because of domestic work and motherly duties.|$|E

Finally, the fury of the attack subsided enough to permit some communication between the former French Guards, who formed the professional core of Lafayette's National Guard militia, and the royal gardes du corps.

40|$|Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} {{syndrome}} (OSAS) {{is a common}} nocturnal disorder characterized {{by the presence of}} repetitive apnea and hypopnea during sleep, daytime sleepiness, and cardiopulmonary dysfunction.

The number of apneas and hypopneas per <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> is termed the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and {{has been used as a}} marker of OSA severity.

5|$|During {{the years}} he worked on Yu Yu Hakusho, Togashi would {{calculate}} the personal time he had based on a formula of four hours per page without scripting and five <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> per night. He wrote in his own dōjinshi Yoshirin de Pon! that he stopped the production on Yu Yu Hakusho out of selfishness. The author had originally wanted to end the manga in December 1993, at {{the climax of the}} Sensui arc. Although there was not a large demand from the editorial staff, Togashi was under a great deal of personal stress at certain points of the series' run, particularly during its final six months of publication. He claimed that, beginning with the Dark Tournament arc, inconsistent sleep resulting from overwork was causing him health problems. He noted himself as being very ill while working on the color pages for Yusuke's match with Chu. There were also many instances where he would create nearly entire manuscripts by himself, such as Yusuke's meeting with Raizen and the battle between Kurama and Karasu. Togashi was relieved {{at the conclusion of the}} manga. The author claimed to not have been involved in the production of the Yu Yu Hakusho anime adaptation due to his own work schedule. He stated that he was greatly impressed by Shigeru Chiba's voice depiction of Kuwabara, admitting that the voice actor understood the character better than Togashi himself.|$|E

25|$|Astronauts {{must remain}} alert and {{vigilant}} while operating complicated equipment. Therefore, getting enough sleep {{is a crucial}} factor of mission success.

Astronauts typically average only about six <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> each night. Cumulative sleep loss and sleep disruption could lead to performance errors and accidents that pose significant risk to mission success. Sleep and circadian cycles also temporally modulate a broad range of physiological, hormonal, behavioral, and cognitive functions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to examine a new {{technique}} based on sound reflections in a flexible tube for identifying obstructive sites of the upper airway during sleep. There was no significant difference between two nights in seven obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) patients regarding the level distribution of pharyngeal narrowings, when the pharynx was divided into two segments (retropalatal and retrolingual). We also compared the level distribution determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the level distribution found by flextube reflectometry in seven OSA patients. There was no significant difference between flextube and MRI level distributions during obstructive events, but due to few subjects the power of the test was limited. We found a statistically significant correlation between the number of flextube narrowings per <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> and the number of obstructive apnoeas and hypopnoeas per <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> determined by polysomnography (PSG) in 21 subjects (Spearman's correlation coefficient r= 0 · 79, P< 0 · 001).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the prevalence {{and severity of}} periodic limb movements during sleep in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and to explore this fact {{as a predictor of}} severity of the condition with respect to mortality. METHODS: In this case-control study, questionnaire and polysomnographic data were analyzed from 35 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. Controls were matched by age, genre, and body mass index. A Kaplan-Meier curve was used to compare the survival time of patients with periodic limb movements <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> index below or above 5. RESULTS: The number of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients with an index greater than five was higher than controls (19 (53 %) versus 4 (11 %); p< 0. 0001), and the mean index was higher (23. 55 ± 40. 07 versus 3. 28 ± 8. 96; p= 0. 0009). Earlier mortality was more common in patients with more than five periodic limb movements per <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> than patients with less than five periodic limb movements per <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> (7 / 19 (37 %) versus 1 / 16 (6 %); p= 0. 04) in this group of patients that had a mean survival of 33 months.
