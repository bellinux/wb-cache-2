50|$|Dr. Gill Pratt, Program Manager DARPA Robotics Challenge {{described}} DARPA and {{its goals}} with the Robotics Challenge:DARPA’s {{role is to}} spur innovation. And we do it by focused, short term efforts. We pick {{things that are not}} impossible, but also not very low risk. So we take very high risk gambles, and those risks have tremendous payoffs. So if we’re successful it means that these robots are actually {{going to be able to}} make a difference. In particular, in disaster scenarios making society more resilient. The lesson of the original challenge Grand Challenge - driverless cars is that persistence pays. It’s important if you know the technology is almost there and you can sort of see the light at the end of the tunnel, a little bit of persistence will pay off. What I’m hoping for in the trials is that some of the teams will score some points. I don’t think that any team is going to score all the points that there are. Maybe no teams will even score half the points that there are. But I think some teams will do moderately well. My expectation is that the robots are going to be slow. What we’re looking for right now is for the teams to just do as well as roughly that one year old child. If we can get there, then we think that we have good reason to believe that some of these teams with continued persistence for another year will actually be able to demonstrate robots that show the utility that these things might have in a real disaster scenario. DARPA is in the innovation business, not in the development business. So, what we <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> wait for technology to be almost ready for something big to happen, and then we add a focused effort to catalyze the something. It doesn’t mean that we take it all the way into a system that’s deployed or to the marketplace. We rely on the commercial sector to do that. But we provide the impetus, the extra push the technology needs to do that.|$|E
40|$|Italo Calvino's story "The Spiral" in Cosmicomics, {{appears to}} the untrained eye {{to be the}} story of a mollusk, {{unconscious}} and unaware of itself, when really it is a story about the writing process. The mollusk "applies himself' to the act of secreting, to making a shell for itself as the shell grows, expands, like a literary artifact, which begins with one sentence and the next, the urgency of each sentence carrying and producing succeeding sentences. The mollusk writes "The Spiral," defen'ing any transcendent meaning, never literally talking about what it's doing when making its shell, but rather about the awareness of making a shell, of the process. The mollusk does not think about what it's going to make. It just creates, and what we <b>do</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> write. "When They Knew Lightness" is collection of short stories in the tradition of what is currently called New Wave Fabulism, fiction that aims to "rework the world. " While realism appears grounded, fabulist fiction unhinges itself from the material and engages a both/and discourse, where both everything and anything is simultaneously possible and necessary. The New Wave fabulist genre exhibits validity and also illogicality, but with such sound precision and beauty, with language that has the ability to take us where we have always wanted to go, but haven't; the fabulist text is a hybrid of so 11 s allowing the writer to explore the "what if' aspect of fiction. Katharine Haake states that we enter into "a world where each character is defined by an essential flaw that somehow reflects not just the sad demise of both earth and history, but also the remaining human capacity for hope and grace," and that is the world I engage in my stories. One thing is certain: the architecture of language allows us to navigate that which is impossible, the places we would otherwise never know...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of ownership Cue: Ownership has {{in recent years}} become a key feature of most development programmes. Too often in the past projects failed because all the ideas, resources and staff were supplied by an outside agency, and the capabilities of local people were ignored. In supplying credit to poor communities, it is frequently observed that when those people are themselves the source of funds and managers of the scheme, there is greater commitment to making the programme work, and greater sustainability once external support ends. The following two reports come from Zimbabwe and The Gambia, and focus on schemes which have been largely funded by local contributions. Our second report comes from The Gambia, where Ismaila Senghore spoke to Fatou Sarr, a training officer at the Promotion Centre of the Village Indigenous Savings and Credit Associations, commonly called VISACAs. He discovered that the associations had {{a strong sense of}} ownership, not least because all the staff in the credit offices were recruited in the villages. IN:		?The belief we have is? OUT:		?don?t pay the project will fail. ? DUR?N	 1 ? 46 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Fatou Sarr, training officer for the Village Indigenous Savings and Credit Associations in The Gambia, on why that particular scheme is succeeding where other credit schemes have failed. Second Interview Sarr	The belief we have is to have all the staff working for the VISACAS to be at the village, so that at the end it can be sustainable because everybody is from the village. But for other projects that have failed the problem is most of their staff were brought in the village {{and at the end of}} the project if they don?t receive salaries anymore everything fails. Senghore	Fatou, you have just highlighted the reason why you are making success where others have failed. Basically the fact that staff attrition is high, when people are not stationed in the village and incorporated within the system. Now what is the kind of loan policy that you promote? Sarr	For us all our loans policies are defined by the villagers themselves, because what we normally <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> give them the guidelines of how to operate the VISACAS. But all the internal regulations of the VISACAS are designed by the villagers themselves. Senghore	Now you are targeting the poor. Are poor people good re-payers of loans? Sarr	Yes because most of our VISACAS now we have 100 % repayment because people in the village they have seen these VISACAS as their own. Because all the VISACAS are managed by the villagers themselves. The funds that are given as loans are from the villagers so they are seeing everything as theirs. So most of the credit schemes before failed because the villagers believed that the money is coming from the government or it is coming from other people but they have the belief with VISACAS that the money that is given out as loans is theirs. So they have to pay back. If they don?t pay the project will fail. End of tape.

40|$|Demonstrating {{ideas for}} better {{varieties}} Cue: Year-by-year farmers have more seeds {{to choose from}} as seed companies bring new varieties to the market. And {{what better way to}} see what you will get for your money - than a demonstration plot. In a demonstration, farmers and seed merchants or researchers work together. They collect a good selection of improved - and local - seeds. They decide on a plot where the seed can be grown, and then they invite farmers from the local community to come and see and discuss the results. If, as the saying goes ?seeing is believing?, then seeing the results on the demonstration plots makes seed choice - and the results of storing seed correctly - crystal clear. In Malawi, Wed Chipungu runs dozens of seed demonstration plots in his work with the Pannar Seed Company. As he tells Patrick Mphaka, he believes the benefits can be greatest if farmers are involved in managing the whole thing. IN:		?What we do, we do not manage the demo plots? OUT:		?So that is my advice. ? DUR?N:	 2 ? 26 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Wed Chipungu works with the Pannar Seed Company Limited in Malawi to promote demonstration field days. He was speaking to Patrick Mphaka. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Chipungu	What we do, we do not manage the demo plots, it is the local farmers themselves that manage the demos. So the people around that farm can learn from that farmer how to manage the crop and they can choose the variety which is doing better in that area. Mphaka	So in other words what you are saying {{is that it is not}} the seeds which we see but the way they can perform after we have planted them that will tell a good story? Chipungu	Yes a good story because on seed we cannot just say this is a good variety without showing a farmer how it performs. But farmers have to know, to see it performing himself not just telling him. That is why we do give some seed to local farmers in the villages to see how it performs themselves. Mphaka	Once you have given that seed to some farmers in the villages to what extent do you think other farmers who have not been given the seed can also learn from the farmer whom you have given the seed to demonstrate? Chipungu	What we <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> distribute some trial seeds in all districts of the country, then during a certain time of the year we conduct field days and we do invite local villages, farmers around that area to attend that field day. So on that day it is when the farmers see themselves, how the varieties are performing and we do ask them to choose which variety they think is better. We want to see the actual thing happening in the field. Mphaka	Taking what you do as a model, what tips would you give farmers? Chipungu	First of all I have to say that a seed is a living thing, they have bought that seed, they have to keep it properly so that it should not die because if they put it on a wet place or at a hot place it will die. So the first thing is to keep the seed safely. 	It is an advice to local farmers, they must not buy seed from, I can say vendors. When I am saying vendors I mean there is no way somebody can just carry seed in a vehicle and start selling like bread. You can buy seed from authorised dealers because if you just buy seed from elsewhere you will regret after a year it is not seed. Mphaka	It might have expired? Chipungu	Expired. Mphaka	Or they might have picked it from a rubbish bin somewhere? Chipungu	Yes that is what people are doing. So that is my advice.

40|$|Beeswax {{candles and}} creams Cue: Livestock such as cattle provide {{a wide range}} of products: meat, milk, hides, manure and labour. Bees may be a much smaller animal, but they also provide an {{impressive}} range of products. The most obvious is honey, but there are several others, including beeswax and Royal Jelly. Bees produce the beeswax in order to construct the honeycomb. Once a bee-keeper has extracted the honey from the comb, this can be melted into a lump of wax, which has many potential uses. As such, beeswax may be a useful source of extra income for bee-keepers. In The Gambia the National Beekeepers? Association {{is at the heart of}} the country?s bee-keeping activities. Beekeepers bring their honey and other bee products to the Association for them to be sold, or used in making value added products. Ismaila Senghore recently visited the Association?s headquarters, located on a busy road in the capital Banjul, to find out more about the value of these bee by-products. IN:		?I am right here at the National ? OUT:		?to you. Thank you very much. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 37 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: And that was Ismaila Senghore reporting from Banjul in The Gambia. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Senghore	I am right here at the National Beekeepers? Association of The Gambia, right in their warehouse where they have the activities of processing of honey going on. And of course we have other by-products also from honey production, that is the wax, like candles, body creams and a lot more. But I have with me here Mr Ebrima Sanyang who is the processing officer of the National Beekeepers? Association of The Gambia. Mr Sanyang is going to tell me exactly how they manage to get the wax in the first place, and what they make out of this wax as by-products which are also meant for the market. Sanyang	Thank you Mr Senghore I am here to give you the view points of the by-products that we have in office here. After extracting out of the honey you put it in a container whereby you can melt it and then produce the wax alone with the bad elements out of it. Then from there you reprocess it again for it to be more clean than before, refining it with coke which will make it cleaner than before. Then you can start to make what you are going to make out of it. Senghore	Now what are the kinds of commodities that you get out of the wax in that form? Sanyang	You can make candles, body cream, wood polish, soap, cosmetics possibly. Senghore	Alright now let?s say if you look at the products that you make, like the ones on display here, the body creams, how do you go about making the body cream for example? Can you explain briefly? Sanyang	Yes ok making body cream you have a certain measurement of the products you are going to use. For the wax itself there is a measurement which is one tea cup full of wax and then you can buy your oil, this vegetable oil, two cups measured in it, put it in the wax, melt it with other products like mentholator or this Karit‚ cream, you add there too to make it soft. Senghore	Ok now let?s talk about the candles, how do you go about making the candles? Sanyang	You are going to break the wax into pieces or into particles, whereby you melt it. And then the other chemical you are going to put inside for it to absorb fire easily is paraffin, which is not available in time. But what we <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> buy these candles from the shops, break it into pieces, melt it together with the wax so that the paraffin inside that candle can be mixed up with the wax to absorb fire easily. Senghore	Now do you make enough for the market, in other words is the demand very high? Sanyang	Well the demand is not so high because we Africans we are not adopting this type of system of candles. But let?s say the whites who always come, sometimes they make a lot of demand, whereby I make it for them, then sell it to them for their own use. Senghore	Finally Mr Sanyang would you say this kind of activity, processing of commodities from wax honey by-products, can be something that can be sustainable amongst your members, like for example they can go and do it on their own even if you are not around? Sanyang	Yes, some of them they do make it because when I am away, sometimes I meet up with others who are making it, and then some comes to my centre to buy wax for making body creams and the likes. Senghore	Therefore what advice would you give to anybody who is planning to go into the processing of such by-products? What kind of advice do you think will be useful to them so they will make successful enterprises like this? Sanyang	Yes, I thought that before you start on the process you have to find all your necessary equipments whereby your work will be easy without any other problem. Senghore	Thank you very much Mr Ebrima Sanyang. That was Mr Ebrima Sanyang talking to me about the processing of wax into commodities that are useable by the local markets and of course by tourists coming here in The Gambia. Mr Sanyang is the Processing Officer of the National Beekeeper?s Association of the Gambia. Mr Sanyang it has been a great pleasure talking to you. Thank you very much.

40|$|Knowing {{where and}} when to sell Cue: For farmers, knowing {{where and when}} to sell their crops {{is one of the}} most {{difficult}} challenges. If they have no knowledge of current market prices, they can easily be exploited. But gathering information about markets may not be easy, especially for people living in very remote areas. So is there anywhere they can get help? According to Fred Frimpong, agricultural coordinator for the Millennium Villages project in Ghana, one answer may lie in teaming up with other farmers. In an interview with Kofi Adu Domfeh, Mr Frimpong began by explaining why having information about market prices is so important. IN:	?The whole idea is about knowing ? OUT:	? which they will get more. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 49 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Fred Frimpong of the Millennium Villages Project in Ghana. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Frimpong	The whole idea is about knowing where you get the right prices for your produce and selling at the right time. So there should be a means of basing your decisions on certain bits of information. What is the price on the market like? How much is it being sold for, per mini-bag, per maxi-bag? Is that the price I want? Looking at the investment I made, will I make any profits if I sell at that rate? You know farmers should be able to make all these decisions and it is based on the market research information that is available to them, that they can make these decisions. So that we look at agriculture from a more business angle, rather than as something we are just doing to occupy ourselves. Domfeh	In general terms, how important is market research to cash crop farmers? Frimpong	In fact, if we were able to take care of marketing of foodstuffs, and undertake the right market research in the country, I guess half of the problems of farmers would be solved. The problem is not increasing production. Even with our subsistence tools, like the hoes and cutlasses, farmers are willing to go all out, till the land and get a lot of output. They have no problem with that. Their problem is what to do with their produce. So there is no way any of us can underestimate the important role that market research plays in this direction, because if we are doing all we can to ensure that they produce and produce more, high quality and store well, and they can?t market, virtually we have defeated the entire purpose. So it is very important that market research is undertaken. Domfeh	Do you think farmers always have to visit several markets at different times, observing what people are selling and buying and talking to people in a bid to actually obtain market information? Frimpong	Not necessarily. You see we are looking forward to the day when farmers will be well organised, so that through the cooperative departments, the cooperative officers at the district level, they can link up with markets and do the market research. You know farming is a time-bound activity. You have to undertake certain field activities during certain times of the year. If you miss that you have problems with the yield. So usually farmers don?t have time to go out to the market and do the kind of research that you are talking about. That would have been the ideal, but there are so many constraints. So if they are in cooperatives, and they have the market research unit within the cooperative, then that unit can take care of the market research and then the others can concentrate on production. So yes, that survey would be important, but it shouldn?t be the headache of every individual farmer. Domfeh	How then do they find out the best places to sell their crops and make contacts with those potential buyers? Frimpong	What we <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> go, scout for buyers for them, and then we link them up. There is another key thing that we are doing. We don?t want a situation where farmers will be dealing with wholesalers and people who come to buy their foodstuffs on an individual basis. So we are also encouraging farmers to form cooperatives, so that they can negotiate for inputs as a group, and also negotiate, bargain on market terms as a group. They will have a stronger bargaining power when they are together. So that is another key thing that we are doing. Even as we link them up with markets, we are also putting the farmers into strong cooperatives. Domfeh	Value addition to cash crop produce is very important, but how does the farmer undertake this in a cost effective way, while also maintaining quality of the yield? Frimpong	If farmers come together they can source loans and access funds; then they can get more into processing. So value addition is very important. In fact if farmers have the capacity to add value to whatever they produce, then post-harvest losses wouldn?t be a headache. You know, farming is a capital intensive business, so at the end of the season the farmer has a lot of debts to clear. So all most farmers are interested in is to sell off whatever they have so they can take care of their household, and pay off whatever debts they have. That?s a huge challenge. So I guess that if we are able to build them to a level where certain basic needs are taken care of, they wouldn?t mind taking their time to get into value addition of their products, processing them into second class products, before going ahead to sell, which they will get more.

In this next interview, Lazarus Laiser spoke to one woman who has done her research ? and it shows. With other women in her village, Rose Machange set up Umangu Enterprises in Tanzania, to sell dried vegetables to local businesses. Its success has been inspiring, and now the group is thinking of expanding the business. But first they had to find credit and, as Rose explains, they needed to form a group and invest some money of their own in the enterprise. IN:	?The chairman of our village? OUT:	?help dry a bigger amount. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 41 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Lazarus Laiser speaking to Rose Machange of Umangu Enterprises in Tanzania. Small businesses can become bigger. But knowing your market ? your customers and your buyers ? is the first step. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Machange	The chairman of our village one day called a village meeting and {{said there is no}} women group in our village. So we called our friends and we agreed to start such a group. Laiser	Where did you get the finances because always it is difficult to get the finances? Machange	After setting our goals we talked and discussed how to start and then we decided to contribute the money in a business of selling the clothes for women house-to-house, and we got a profit and started a small garden and our profit grew. Laiser	Did you get any benefits? Machange	Yes we got, it is still going on and we are still going on with it, it is growing. We got a lot of benefits {{and we were able to}} build good houses; that is modern houses. This is our office we built from the profits we got and we are able to pay our school fees for all our children. Laiser	I am still standing outside the Umangu Enterprises office with the chairperson Mrs Rose, and I am interested to know more about this process of drying vegetables and fruits that you say that you are dealing with here in the office and I can see some dried things here on the table, Rose. Machange	As you can see, these are the vegetables taken from the gardens and we have already dried them. Laiser	The vegetables are already dried and it has its greenish colour and looks like maybe somehow hard but this is ready just to eat? Machange	Yes you can even taste. Laiser	Is it sweet? Machange	Yes it is very sweet. Laiser	If I taste? Machange	Yes, it is very nice. Laiser	Um, ok it is very sweet yes, it is very sweet and you added salt in? Machange	Yes, as you can see, as you have already tasted what we <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> use a simple method of drying them to allow the duration of storage so that it will take long. Laiser	Which type of greens are you dealing with? Machange	We as Umangu Enterprise we dry all the greens found in our area. We have that knowledge on how to dry them but we have two types of green which are the soft and hard. Laiser	Right, the green vegetables are varied into two types, they are hard and soft. Ok, how do you do now the drying process? Machange	We bring the vegetables from the garden, we wash them, we wash them well in clean water, that is, and put on a clean place. We take a piece of a clean white cotton cloth and put on the greens and tighten it. After that we boil water and add salt on it. We then put the green tightened with the piece of cloth into hot water for about one minute if it?s so soft and two minutes if it?s too hard. Laiser	Why do you add salt in this water? Machange	We usually use salt because it helps to protect the greenish not to be lost because if it?s lost the vitamins are lost therefore we dry vegetables with greenish if you eat you get all the vitamins. After boiling for one or two minutes we put in a dry place - a bed - and it stays there for one day or some hours. It depends on how hot the sun is and it is not advisable to dry them too much because it will loose its vitamins. After drying them well, we put on the nylon pack and keep safe. We use them in our homes and also we sell them to other people. Laiser	And you have people who are coming to buy? Machange	Yes, very many. Laiser	Now also the mangoes I can see also that bucket you say that you have some mangoes inside that are in the process also for drying. This is another fruit that you are dealing with here. You said also you are dealing with tomatoes. These are the mangoes, so?. Machange	Yes, as you can see these are the mangoes from our own trees found in our farms. As you can see we have cut them into small pieces ready for drying. After the six weeks, we will add various spices to get a mango pickle ready to sell and for home use. Laiser	Which is the starting point of drying? Machange	We take the mango from the tree. Mind you they should be the mangoes which are ripe but did not drop down by themselves. We wash them and put on a dry place to drop water. After that we wash them with clean water and cut them into small pieces and weigh together with adding salt and put into bucket. Laiser	Then after, how do you use these dried mangoes? Machange	For our mango women group we sell them and get a good income. People usually come and buy from us. We can also use them by making mango pickles and we sell more money. Laiser	Do you satisfy the market that is available? You said that you sell the product to other people. Machange	No not at all. We have a big market and currently we did not manage to satisfy the market. We are only a few and we do not have many buckets to produce more but it is encouraging, the market is available. Laiser	Which strategies now do you have to satisfy the market? Machange	We are planning to sell and buy bigger buckets to help dry a bigger amount.

40|$|Cue: In the dry {{parts of}} {{northern}} Kenya, water is very scarce, and harvesting rainfall {{is essential for}} communities to survive. Tribes {{in this area are}} livestock keepers, and harvest water for themselves and their animals. One of the most common water harvesting structures is called a pan. Pans are ponds dug in the ground, usually 2 to 4 metres deep. They can vary in size, with large ones being as much as 200 metres long, and smaller ones being only 10 metres square. Pans are dug in low-lying land, normally in flat areas. They collect water from small streams and rivulets which flow over the surrounding land during rainfall. The NGO Action Aid is currently working in 20 districts in Kenya, helping people there to access clean, safe water, and {{to reduce the amount of}} time that villagers must spend collecting water. Part of that work involves helping communities to dig new pans, and to restore pans that have been lost to siltation. Siltation occurs when a pan fills with sand and mud, perhaps because of flooding or poor maintenance, reducing the amount of water that the pan can hold. Yusuf Artan, an engineer with Action Aid, spoke to Winnie Onyimbo about their work, and began by explaining how the pans are actually excavated, or dug. IN:		?The pans are either excavated by machine?? OUT:		??thing could happen in that area. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 48 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Yusuf Artan, an engineer with Action Aid, describing work in northern Kenya which has used rainwater harvesting to bring clean, safe water to livestock keeping communities. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Artan	The pans are either excavated by machine, or they can actually be excavated hand dug. Some of them are big, some of them are small. You can have a pan of 10 metres by 10 metres square; that is actually about 200, 000 litres of water stored in that pan. The design is simple. It has to have an inlet, and after the pan has filled we try to make sure that the water does not come out. And in case there is excess, we have a spillway where the excess water can flow without actually affecting the pan itself. Onyimbo	What are the benefits of the system? Artan	The benefits of the system, first of all, is that they are simple to construct. The communities themselves can actually come together, do the excavations communally. It does not require a lot of technical expertise. It is just by observation that actually you can see that we can have this. The community themselves have been doing that for quite some time. Onyimbo	And what kind of crops does this system support? Artan	In the drier parts of the country the cushitic people actually don?t grow any crops. They use it for livestock purposes, because livestock rearing is their main means of livelihood, and it is very important to them. So the livestock themselves get water from that area and the human beings also, they get their domestic water from those pans. Onyimbo	What challenges have you faced in building and maintaining the physical structures? Artan	Some of the challenges we have faced with pans is they are actually open to the air, and due to the high temperatures, the rate of evaporation is quite high. So as much as possible we try to dig pans which are deeper, so long as the bottom of the pan is actually not pervious, and we don?t have seepage of water to the ground. And in areas where we find the seepage is quite high we try to use clay; either we import or we get clay from the neighbourhood, simply to make an impervious layer. Another challenge that we face also is mobilising the community to understand that we need to control that source of water. Because in most of the pans that you visit, the animals, the human beings all take water from that pan, where they actually just go into the pan. So the issue of hygiene is quite a problem. Onyimbo	What kind of challenges do you face in terms of the environment? Artan	First of all is the invasion of the water catchment areas by human beings. That is quite a challenge, that we see a lot of depletion of forests within the country, simply because of the explosion in human numbers. The other challenge we are also facing is that ground cover is actually being depleted in most of the areas, either through over-grazing, especially in the northern part of the country. And we find that the water structures, the pans that were there, one of the biggest challenges is actually siltation, and siltation is simply because the surface waters carry a lot of silt, that is sand and mud, to the pans. So with time you find these pans are actually slowly filled up by sand, thereby reducing their capacities. And that is actually one of the biggest challenges we have been facing in that area. And hopefully if we can involve the communities more in terms understanding what are the causes of siltation, building silt traps and ensuring that the catchment areas, the bushes and the grass and everything are not depleted, they will actually be able to link siltation to actually conserving the environment. Onyimbo	What is the role of the community in managing the system? Artan	One of the projects we have been doing is Takaba community water supply project. This is a project to supply water to the people of Takaba and their environs. The project was started in 2004. The project entails construction of about 3 pans, and joining them together, and the water is pumped to the top of a hill where it is filtered and distributed to the communities. The role of the community in terms of this project is that actually it has been from the beginning, where we actually have been doing the consultations with them. They were actually involved in the design itself. It was taken back to them, they validated the design. And they have also been doing the supervision of the works by the contractor. Because we believe that the inclusion of the communities is very important in management of water resources. Because a water project which the communities have not been involved with will not be sustainable in the long run. Onyimbo	So how is the response from the community? Artan	The response from the community initially is that they could not, first of all, believe it. The design itself was a little bit quite foreign, because we were trying to link up three dams and people were to get water from communal water points, or kiosks. And the communities there are used to getting water from the pans themselves, where actually the animals and the human beings, all of them go to the pans to get water. But what we are trying to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> are trying to improve on the hygiene and to have water which is not actually contaminated. So we are distributing this water at communal points. And initially there was sort of some sense of disbelief that actually this system might not work. It has never been seen within that area. But eventually when they saw water coming out of the taps, there was actually a sense of happiness, there was joy and there was a lot of thanksgiving to the almighty, that actually such a thing could happen in that area. End of track. Pans are a simple method of storing water, particularly relevant for livestock farmers in arid areas...|$|E
