50|$|Bras dOr {{was named}} {{in honour of}} Bras dOr Lake on Nova Scotias Cape Breton Island, where {{inventor}} Alexander Graham Bell performed hydrofoil experiments in the early 20th century near his estate and new laboratory at Beinn Bhreagh, setting the world watercraft speed record in the process. In 1909 the lake was also the historic site of the first flight of an aircraft in Canada and the British Commonwealth; the airplane, named the Silver Dart, was built by the Aerial Experiment Association under Dr. Bells tutelage. The lakes name was thus fitting for a <b>hydrofoil</b> <b>vessel</b> which could fly above an oceans surface.|$|E
50|$|In 1946 a GAZ-M-20 Pobeda light {{truck and}} a GAZ-51 truck left the {{assembly}} line of the Gorky Automobile Plant. In 1947 a trolleybus service was opened in the city. In 1949, {{the construction of the}} Chkalov Staircase was completed. October 7, 1949 there is a major catastrophe of a passenger river ship Finnish No. 6, carrying out the flight Gorky - Bor. In April 1951 the construction of the Gorkovskaya hydroelectric power station began. The first turbine of the station was launched on November 2, 1955. In 1957, the Krasnoye Sormovo plant produces a high-speed <b>hydrofoil</b> <b>vessel</b> Raketa-1 (chief designer Rostislav Aleksyev). The first amateur television center, located in the club named after Frunze, began work in 1953. The construction of the Gorky state television center was completed in the autumn of 1957.|$|E

With the state observer, a feedback linearized iterative sliding mode controller is designed for the stabilization of the lateral dynamics of the fully submerged <b>hydrofoil</b> <b>vessel.</b> The stability of the overall closed-loop system is analyzed based on Lyapunov stability theory.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a two-time scale control {{structure for the}} course keeping of an advanced marine surface vehicle, namely, the fully submerged <b>hydrofoil</b> <b>vessel.</b> The mathematical model of course keeping control for the fully submerged <b>hydrofoil</b> <b>vessel</b> is firstly analyzed. The dynamics of the hydrofoil servo system is considered during control design. A two-time scale model is established so that the controllers of the fast and slow subsystems can be designed separately. A robust integral of {{the sign of the}} error (RISE) feedback control is proposed for the slow varying system and a disturbance observer based state feedback control is established for the fast varying system, which guarantees the disturbance rejection performance for the two-time scale systems. Asymptotic stability is achieved for the overall closed-loop system based on Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation results show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology...|$|E
40|$|Hydrofoil ships cruise {{at large}} speeds {{and are often}} {{expected}} to operate in rough weather conditions. The motion of these ships due to their encounter with ambient waves can become uncomfortable or even dangerous {{without the use of}} some form of motion control. The objective of this thesis is to study the active motion control of high-speed hydrofoil vessels. This work is composed of two parts, reflecting the two disciplines applied: hydrodynamics and optimal control theory. In the first part, a two-dimensional computer code is developed for the calculation of forces and the integration of the equations of motion for fully submerged lifting bodies operating near a free surface. A Rankine source boundary element (panel) method is used assuming potential flow around the body. As a result, the motions of a <b>hydrofoil</b> <b>vessel</b> operating at high speed in ambient waves can be estimated in the time domain. In the second part, the application of optimal control theory to motion control of hydrofoil ships is investigated. The code developed {{in the first part of}} this work is used as a simulation tool for the assessment of control laws designed using state-space linear-quadratic methods. (cont.) It is found that a linear-quadratic optimal controller can attenuate the motion response of the vessel advancing in monochromatic or ocean waves, with proper adjustment of the cost matrices that enter the quadratic performance criterion used. Accurate dynamic modeling is crucial in the design of control laws for any system. Vessels that operate on or near the free surface experience hydrodynamic memory effects due to their own motion. Casting the seakeeping equations of motion into a linear, time-invariant state-space model suitable for the design of optimal control laws is challenging since there is no straightforward way of including these memory effects in the model. In this work, the seakeeping equations of motion are cast in a linear state-space form which does not include memory effects, and the motion control simulation results show that this model is satisfactory for the design of <b>hydrofoil</b> <b>vessel</b> control laws. by Iason Chatzakis.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to develop and test {{techniques}} for the computational optimization of hydrofoil sections and lifting surfaces advancing under a free surface. A mathematical model was developed based on the extension of a two-dimensional potential flow solution to account for three dimensional effects. Prandtl's lifting line theory was used to account for induced drag and downwash {{at the leading edge}} of the foil. Strip theory was used to extend the two-dimensional wave drag solutions to three dimensions for high aspect ratio foils. A semi-empirical correction was added to account for viscous drag. The drag-to-lift ratio of foil sections and lifting surfaces were optimized using first order gradient techniques. Optimization studies involving submerged foil sections suggest that trading buoyancy for a reduction in wave drag will lead to optimal geometries. Difficulties encountered resulting from the adoption of a potential flow model were identified and discussed. The lifting surface optimization {{was carried out}} using the coefficients of Glauert's circulation series as design variables. At high speeds it was shown that non-elliptical loading can produce reductions in the drag-to-lift ratio of a lifting surface. Induced drag dominated the low-speed optimization, and elliptical loading was shown to be optimal at the low end of expected operating speeds of a <b>hydrofoil</b> <b>vessel.</b> An adjoint formulation for the problem of optimizing the shape of a lifting section under a free surface was derived for use in future research. by Gregory Michael Tozzi.
