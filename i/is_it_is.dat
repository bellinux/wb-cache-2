5|$|A {{reversible}} {{cellular automaton}} is a cellular automaton {{in which every}} configuration has a unique predecessor. That <b>is,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a regular grid of cells, each containing a state drawn from a finite set of states, with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based on the states of their neighbors, such that the previous state of any cell before an update can be determined uniquely from the updated states of all the cells. The time-reversed dynamics of a reversible cellular automaton can always be described by another cellular automaton rule, possibly on a much larger neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is {{a measure}} of how active a {{hurricane}} season <b>is.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 104. This explains why Hurricane Guillermo has a higher ACE than Linda. It was not as strong as that storm, but because it was above tropical storm force for a longer time, it reached a higher ACE level. As a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm, tropical depressions are not included in these tables. For all storms, ACE is given to three significant figures. The ACE in the east Pacific proper (140°W to North America) is given; the ACE in the central Pacific (the international dateline to 140°W) is given in brackets.|$|E
5|$|Michael Jackson's This <b>Is</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> a 2009 American documentary–concert film {{directed}} by Kenny Ortega that documents Michael Jackson's rehearsals and preparation for his concert {{series of the}} same name that was originally scheduled to start on July 13, 2009, but was cancelled due to his death eighteen days prior on June 25. The film consists of Jackson rehearsing musical numbers, directing his team, and additional behind-the-scenes footage including dancer auditions and costume design. Ortega confirmed that none of the footage was originally intended for release, but after Jackson's death it was agreed that the film be made. The footage was filmed in Los Angeles at the Staples Center and The Forum, and features a clip from East Rutherford's Arena where Jackson publicly announced the concert series.|$|E

5|$|Saturn is a gas giant {{because it}} is {{predominantly}} composed of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite surface, though it may have a solid core. Saturn's rotation causes it to have {{the shape of an}} oblate spheroid; that <b>is,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator. Its equatorial and polar radii differ by almost 10%: 60,268km versus 54,364km. Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar System, are also oblate but to a lesser extent. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water—about 30% less. Although Saturn's core is considerably denser than water, the average specific density of the planet is 0.69g/cm3 due to the atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times the Earth's mass, and Saturn is 95 times the mass of the Earth. Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold 92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.|$|E

The debate about distinguishing AS from HFA is partly due to a tautological dilemma where disorders are defined based on severity of impairment, so that studies that appear to confirm differences based on severity are to be expected.|$|E

5|$|To a {{large extent}} the work is composite; that <b>is,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a {{compilation}} borrowing from or at least using earlier sources. These include the early medieval writer Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, a chronicle that was associated with Bede's De temporum ratione, the Chronicon ex chronicis, and William of Poitiers' Gesta Guillelmi II ducis Normannorum. Lesser-used sources include the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Orderic Vitalis' Historia Ecclesiastica, Stephen of Ripon's Vita Sancti Wilfrithi, William of Malmesbury's Gesta pontificum Anglorum, {{a list of the}} kings of Wessex, the Old English poem The Battle of Maldon, and a number of saints' lives, including some written by Eadmer, Felix, Abbo of Fleury, Goscelin, and Osbern of Canterbury. The work on Maldon was included because the hero of the work was Byrhtnoth, a patron of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|A lake (from Latin lacus) is a terrain feature (or {{physical}} feature), a body {{of liquid}} {{on the surface of}} a world that is localized to the bottom of basin (another type of landform or terrain feature; that <b>is,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, {{a body of}} water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river. The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of ethane, most likely mixed with methane. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.|$|E
5|$|Chest x-ray is {{the initial}} imaging {{technique}} used to diagnose TBI. The film {{may not have}} any signs in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Indications of TBI seen on radiographs include deformity in the trachea or a defect in the tracheal wall. Radiography may also show cervical emphysema, air in the tissues of the neck. X-rays may also show accompanying injuries and signs such as fractures and subcutaneous emphysema. If subcutaneous emphysema occurs and the hyoid bone appears in an X-ray to be sitting unusually high in the throat, {{it may be an}} indication that the trachea has been severed. TBI is also suspected if an endotracheal tube appears in an X-ray to be out of place, or if its cuff appears to be more full than normal or to protrude through a tear in the airway. If a bronchus is torn all the way around, the lung may collapse outward toward the chest wall (rather than inward, as it usually does in pneumothorax) because it loses the attachment to the bronchus which normally holds it toward the center. In a person lying face-up, the lung collapses toward the diaphragm and the back. This sign, described in 1969, is called fallen lung sign and is pathognomonic of TBI (that <b>is,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> diagnostic for TBI because it does not occur in other conditions); however it occurs only rarely. In as many as one in five cases, people with blunt trauma and TBI have no signs of the injury on chest X-ray. CT scanning detects over 90% of TBI resulting from blunt trauma, but neither X-ray nor CT are a replacement for bronchoscopy.|$|E
