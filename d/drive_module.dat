25|$|In the Autumn of 2006 on {{the trade}} fairs in Hannover the world premier {{occurred}} of the Solaris Urbino 18 Hybrid with hybrid power. The model was made with the cooperation with Allison Transmission and Cummins, which already had been engaged in previous hybrid bus models in North America. The {{main part of the}} model is the Cummins ISLe4 engine with 8.9litre displacement which generates 248kW (340 HP) of power. The second main part of this model is the EP50 system of Allison Transmission with the Allison Ev50 engine. The concept is created by the use of one diesel engine and two electric engines with each having 75kW of power output, which links with the Ev <b>DRIVE</b> <b>module.</b> The system also uses the produced energy when braking, which is accumulated in a nickel-metal hydride batteries located on the roof {{in the front of the}} vehicle. The prototype appeared in mid-2006 and went into production in 2007. The location of the electric and diesel engines is in the front part of the bus between the two doors.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a GA-based optimization procedure for bioinspired heterogeneous modular multiconfigurable chained microrobots. When constructing heterogeneous chained modular robots that {{are composed of}} several different <b>drive</b> <b>modules,</b> one must select the type and position of the modules that form the chain.

This paper {{presents a}}n offline control system that allows the development of new configuration schemes and locomotion gaits for these heterogeneous modular multiconfigurable chained microrobots. The offline control system is based on a simulator that is specifically designed for chained modular robots and allows them to develop and learn new locomotion patterns.

40|$|A {{virtual machine}} tool (VMT) is {{presented}} in this two-part paper. In Part 1, the analytical foundation for a virtual machining system is developed, which is envisioned {{as the foundation for}} a comprehensive simulation environment capable of predicting the outcome of cutting processes. The VMT system undergoes “pseudo-real machining”, before actual cutting with a CNC machine tool takes place, to provide the proper cutting conditions for process planners and to compensate or control the machining process in terms of the productivity and attributes of the products. The attributes can be characterized by the machined surface error, dimensional accuracy, roughness, integrity, and so forth. The main components of the VMT are the cutting process, application, thermal behavior, and feed <b>drive</b> <b>modules.</b> In Part 1, the cutting process module is presented.

40|$|The {{combined}} DINA-CH and CRONOS simulator is a {{tool for}} free-boundary tokamak plasma simulations which require both advanced core transport modelling and free-boundary plasma evolution. Previous attempts at this work revealed several difficulties [1]. A discrepancy existed between the free-boundary equilibrium of the DINA-CH and the one reconstructed by CRONOS {{and this has been}} removed. All required equilibrium data for the CRONOS transport calculation are now provided directly from DINA-CH. An initialization process for selecting the initial plasma profiles has been simplified and diagnostic interfaces have been added for the kinetic control capability. The free-boundary evolution of the ITER hybrid scenario during the flat-top phase is expected to be presented as a demonstration of a typical result from this work. To make this simulator a useful tool for the investigation of free-boundary features while still maintaining a performance close to that of the CRONOS transport code, the computation timesteps in the ICRH and NBI heating and current <b>drive</b> <b>modules</b> need to become variable. These heating and current <b>drive</b> <b>modules</b> are being re-examined with this in mind. The interaction between DINA-CH and the EU Integrated Modelling data structure...|$|R

These standard modules accept a single direction and pulse count (rotation distance) as input. They may also include over-temperature monitoring, over-torque and stall detection features. As the encoder type, gearhead ratio and overall system dynamics are application specific, {{it is more difficult}} to produce the overall controller as an off-the-shelf module and so these are often implemented as part of the main controller.|$|R

5000|$|It has a {{solid steel}} dark green body with an opto-based pedal {{on the right and}} red LED display on the top left. It uses the Variable Architecture Modeling System (V.A.M.S [...] ) technology. In general, there are three main {{internal}} modules: for drive, for modulation and for delay. The unit allows a high level of distortion customization by using specialized software. It also allows the use of external distortion. The technology used in the unit does not allow full reordering of the effects but allows some of modulation effects like wah and phaser to be connected before or after the <b>drive</b> <b>module.</b> The <b>drive</b> <b>module</b> implements dynamic related effects like compressor, overdrive, distortion and fuzz. After the <b>drive</b> <b>module,</b> the noise gate module called ZNR (ZOOM Nose Reduction) is connected, followed by a parametric equalizer (presence, treble, middle, bass). The amp simulation module is connected next and allows various types of guitar amplifier simulations. The modulation module implements effects like wah, phaser, chorus, ring modulator, tremolo, vibrato, flanger and pitch shifter. The delay module is used to implement delay and reverb effects. Effects that require high processing power use modulation and delay module together. One such effect is the jam play effect, which allows, for example, a guitar player to play a rhythm guitar part and then play a solo part over it. The unit design is oriented toward ease of use by providing more knobs than usually found on such units, thus making the unit look more like a chain of effect boxes instead of the typical effect processor with a [...] "few knobs many functions" [...] type design. The unit has mature MIDI capabilities, allowing both control from an external sequencer or using the unit as a MIDI controller. The MIDI OUT can be configured to act as MIDI THRU.|$|E

50|$|Design of {{the legs}} of a {{humanoid}} robot is certainly the most challenging part in the design procedure. The 6 DOF leg structure allows the foot to have dexterous motion {{with respect to the}} pelvis. The lower-body joints are actuated by EC motors and a combined timing belt-pulley and harmonic <b>drive</b> <b>module</b> is exploited for power transmission. Rigid and light-weight structure may greatly enhance performance of a position controlled walking machine. In order to alleviate the vibration of the joints which may be existed due to flexibility of harmonic drive or the cross modules (in ankle and hip), by employing high resolution absolute encoders at the joints output, the cascade position control loop has been exploited which decreased the vibration of the joints. In order to increase rigidity of the links, while keeping the robot’s weight low as much as possible, aluminum plates have been used for the shanks and thighs.|$|E
