40|$|Recent {{experiments}} have shown {{rotation of the}} plane of polarization of light reflected {{from the surface of}} some superconductors. This indicates that time reversal and certain mirror symmetries are broken in the ordered phase. The photon energy exceeds the electronic bandwidth, so that completely filled or completely <b>empty</b> <b>bands</b> must play a role. We show that in strong-coupling theory a Coulomb interaction may produce an order parameter in the unoccupied band that explains the observations. The theory puts tight constraints on the form of the order parameter in different bands.

The game followed similar ruling as the game [...] "Operation" [...] where the game board was electrically charged and a shock results if your game piece touched the metal. The game, however, has no batteries in it so the keyboardist hooks the game to the buildings power battery. Each time {{a member of the}} band touches the metal, they disintegrate, as if they were electrocuted. The ending of the video leaves Fraser alone {{to make it to the}} final safe position on the board, but we find out she doesn't. The video is cut with interpolations of the band playing their instruments together, with each time a member of the band being eliminated from the game, they have also been taken from the band scene. This is how we know Fraser doesn't win the game, as the final shot of the video shows an <b>empty</b> <b>band</b> set.|$|E
50|$|For partial filling {{at the top}} of the valence band, it {{is helpful}} to {{introduce}} the concept of an electron hole.Although the electrons in the valence band are always moving around, a completely full valence band is inert, not conducting any current.If an electron is taken out of the valence band, then the trajectory that the electron would normally have taken is now missing its charge.For the purposes of electric current, this combination of the full valence band, minus the electron, can be converted into a picture of a completely <b>empty</b> <b>band</b> containing a positively charged particle that moves in the same way as the electron.Combined with the negative effective mass of the electrons {{at the top of}} the valence band, we arrive at a picture of a positively charged particle that responds to electric and magnetic fields just as a normal positively charged particle would do in vacuum, again with some positive effective mass.This particle is called a hole, and the collection of holes in the valence band can again be understood in simple classical terms (as with the electrons in the conduction band).|$|E

40|$|We derive a {{generalization}} of the RKKY interaction to semiconductors using perturbation theory on a non-degenerated two-impurity Anderson model. In metals the interaction is mediated by excitations of free carriers over the Fermi-energy. In semiconductors, where no carriers are present, {{the only possible}} excitations {{are those of the}} localized impurity electrons (or holes) themselves. Thus a possible interaction is closely related to superexchange. We find an oscillating anti-ferromagnetic spin-spin coupling due to impurity electron (hole) excitations. By treating the coupling through <b>empty</b> <b>bands</b> (superexchange) along the same route as carrier mediated interactions (RKKY) it is easy to compare these two kinds of spin-spin coupling. The interaction derived here is of special interest for diluted magnetic semiconductors. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, to be published in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
40|$|Recently, Shih et al. [Phys. Rev.

We reexamine the GW calculation with the full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave method and find that even with 3000 bands the band gap is not completely converged. A hyperbolical fit is used to extrapolate to infinite bands. Furthermore, we eliminate the linearization error for high-lying states with local orbitals. In fact, our calculated band gap is considerably larger than in previous studies, but somewhat smaller than that of Shih et al. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a wireless communication network with a fixed number of frequency sub-bands {{to be shared}} among several transmitter-receiver pairs. In traditional frequency division (FD) systems, the available sub-bands are partitioned into disjoint clusters (frequency bands) and assigned to different users (each user transmits only in its own band). If the number of users sharing the spectrum is random, this technique may lead to inefficient spectrum utilization (a considerable fraction of the <b>bands</b> may remain <b>empty</b> most of the time). In addition, this approach inherently requires either a central network controller for frequency allocation, or cognitive radios which sense and occupy the <b>empty</b> <b>bands</b> in a dynamic fashion. These shortcomings motivate us {{to look for a}} decentralized scheme (without using cognitive radios) which allows the users to coexist, while utilizing the spectrum efficiently.

40|$|In this study, {{the quantum}} state {{depression}} (QSD) in semiconductor quantum well (QW) is investigated. The QSD {{emerge from the}} ridged geometry of the QW boundary. Ridges impose additional boundary conditions on the electron wave function and some quantum states become forbidden. State density reduces in all energy bands, including conduction band (CB). Hence, electrons, rejected from the filled bands, must occupy quantum states in the <b>empty</b> <b>bands</b> due to Pauli Exclusion principle. Both the electron concentration in CB and Fermi energy increases {{as in the case}} of donor doping. Since quantum state density is reduced, the ridged quantum well (RQW) exhibits quantum properties at widths approaching 200 nm. Wide RQW can be used to improve photon confinement in QW-based optoelectronics devices. Reduction in the state density increases the carrier mobility and makes the ballistic transport regime more pronounced in the semiconductor QW devices. Furthermore, the QSD doping does not introduce scattering centers and can be used for power electronics. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

30|$|In addition, {{recently}} a blind sensing spectrum technique {{has been introduced}} based on the wavelet transform which is able to deliver spectrum estimation over a wide-band of frequencies [43, 44]. In this method the wavelets are used for detecting irregularities in the spectrum to determine the boundaries of important image structures. In this light the boundaries indicate the transitions from an occupied band to an <b>empty</b> <b>band</b> and the spectrum occupancy can be assessed based on the estimated powers within these bands. However, this method is currently not feasible for practical use while it requires high costs in terms of computational complexity and a very high spectral sampling rate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} novel score {{detector}} for temporal spectrum opportunity detection in cognitive radio by exploiting {{the differences in}} both energy and correlation of the <b>empty</b> <b>band</b> and the occupied band. Motivated by the challenge of detecting a weak primary user’s signal without precise knowledge of the signal, where the conventional energy detector faces the limit of ”SNR wall”, we assume a simple model which captures a key difference between noise and primary user’s signal – their correlation structures. Besides the merit of incorporating signal correlation, our score detector also avoids the computational complexity of covariance matrix inversion incurred by the corresponding maxi-mum likelihood statistic assuming signal correlation. We provide a theoretical approximation to the false-alarm-rate of the score detector, {{which can be used}} to determine the threshold efficiently. We demonstrate that our approximation is quite accurate, and that our score detector has an advantage when the signal is weak and correlated. I...|$|E

Dense sampling, often required to accurately describe transport and optical properties of bulk materials, can be demanding to compute, for instance, in combination with hybrid functionals in density functional theory (DFT) or with perturbative expansions beyond DFT such as the $GW$ method. The scheme is based on solving the k. p method and extrapolating from multiple reference k-points.
