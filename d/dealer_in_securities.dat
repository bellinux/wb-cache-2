50|$|In 1962, Sir Godfrey Ralli and his brother, Lucas Ralli, (Major), who {{had both}} {{been on the}} Board of Ralli Brothers, {{set up a new}} venture called G & L Ralli Investment & Trustee Co. Ltd. The Company was {{established}} in August 1962, and shortly afterwards registered as a Trust Corporation. (Source: Evening Standard, 26/9/62). The original capital of the Company was £250,000, consisting of 250K shares of £1. G & L was primarily concerned with the management of trust funds, but soon branched out into general private client portfolio management. The Company later became a Licensed <b>Dealer</b> <b>in</b> <b>Securities,</b> and was registered as a member of FIMBRA. The mid-1970s, saw Sir Godfrey taking 'early retirement', to pursue country interests. Lucas, the younger brother, subsequently took over as Chairman of the Group, with Mike Kemp promoted to Managing Director, soon thereafter. In 1983, Ralli Investment Company Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary, acquired a Deposit-Taking Licence from the Bank of England. John Ralli, son of Lucas, was a Director of G & L Ralli, from 1986 -1990.|$|E

A framework, called EFPIF (e-Financial Process Integration Framework), was proposed that can come to financial information and investment analysis integration, and provide an interaction framework to investors, investment advisory corporation, <b>dealer</b> <b>in</b> <b>securities,</b> bank, and quoted company. A feasible system structure and case implementation was proposed to explain the integrated and flexible properties of EFPIF. One WS 4 DB using the basic form of XBRL was designed which transforms financial statements into Web Services among EFPIF, and improves the usability of financial statements. An investor can analysis and understand the investment environment better by the mechanism proposed in this research. Consequent investment risk and loss can then be reduced.

40|$|We {{describe}} a new mechanism {{that explains the}} transmission of liquidity shocks from one security to another ("liquidity spillovers"). Dealers use prices of other securities {{as a source of}} information. As prices of less liquid securities convey less precise information, a drop in liquidity for one security raises the uncertainty for <b>dealers</b> <b>in</b> other <b>securities,</b> thereby affecting their liquidity. The direction of liquidity spillovers is positive if the fraction of dealers with price information on other securities is high enough. Otherwise liquidity spillovers can be negative. For some parameters, the value of price information increases with the number of dealers obtaining this information. In this case, related securities can appear segmented, even if the cost of price information is small.

40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{a model of}} price formation in an economy with a decentralized dealership market {{for each of the}} traded <b>securities,</b> <b>in</b> continuous time. Each dealer is a competitive liquidity provider for non-dealer investors in the partial market for the given <b>security.</b> Quotes are <b>in</b> the form of strictly monotone pricing schedules. Both dealer and non-dealer investors have costly access to best quotes in the inter-dealer market. The <b>dealers</b> <b>in</b> a particular <b>security</b> have an advantage over other investors <b>in</b> that <b>security</b> <b>in</b> that they observe their respective private order flows of incoming trades. A <b>dealer</b> <b>in</b> a given <b>security</b> uses the observed order flow (coming jointly from other dealers and non-dealers) to improve the subjective estimates of relevant aggregate variables: the return on the security and the aggregate public (i. e. non-dealer) order flow. These sources of uncertainty have diffusion form and are dealt with according to principles of portfolio optimization <b>in</b> continuous time. <b>Dealers</b> are competitive, i. e. all agents are free to approach any dealer. I show how the dealership-based market structure leads to a modification of the traditional Consumption-based CAPM. In the case of informational customer-dealer asymmetries, I derive a formula for the deviation of the transaction price differential from the one prevailing in the full information case. The deviation is shown to be present even if the asymmetry only exists in the knowledge of the aggregate public order flow and does not concern the fundamentals. dealership market, continuous-time optimization, asset price, asymmetric information, Bayesian learning...|$|R

40|$|Business {{demand for}} short- and longterm credit and {{consumer}} demand for instalment loans have been smaller {{in the past}} 12 months than in other recent years. The Federal Government has borrowed slightly less on balance {{in the past year}} than in the preceding year, but will need to increase its borrowing substantially in the next six months. Long-term borrowing by State and local governments, on the other hand, has been in record volume, and lending on real estate mortgages has remained large. Indications are that credit demand in these areas will continue strong during the remainder of 1954. Commercial banks, with reserves adequate for further credit expansion but with a reduced demand for loans, increased their investments in Federal, State and local government, and corporate securities over the 12 -month period ending June 30, 1954. They were also more active <b>in</b> lending to <b>dealers</b> <b>in</b> <b>securities</b> and continued to add to their holdings of real estate loans. As a result, commercial bank credit increased substantially. Demand deposit and currency holdings of businesses and individuals have increased slightly since mid- 1953.

50|$|There are {{two methods}} of issuing credit. The issuer can market the {{securities}} {{directly to a}} buy and hold investor such as most money market funds. Alternatively, it can sell the paper to a dealer, who then sells the paper in the market. The dealer market for commercial paper involves large securities firms and subsidiaries of bank holding companies. Most of these firms also are <b>dealers</b> <b>in</b> US Treasury <b>securities.</b> Direct issuers of commercial paper usually are financial companies that have frequent and sizable borrowing needs and find it more economical to sell paper {{without the use of}} an intermediary. In the United States, direct issuers save a dealer fee of approximately 5 basis points, or 0.05% annualized, which translates to $50,000 on every $100 million outstanding. This saving compensates for the cost of maintaining a permanent sales staff to market the paper. Dealer fees tend to be lower outside the United States.|$|R

The Handbook does not specifically deal with the role of financial intermediaries in money markets, as opposed to securities markets, although, particularly in a developing market economy, there may be a fair degree of overlap between these two markets, so that some of the argumentation here could apply equally to the role of specialist financial intermediaries in money markets.
