50|$|The {{cross-slide}} (3) {{rides on}} the carriage {{and has a}} feedscrew that travels {{at right angles to}} the main spindle axis. This permits facing operations to be performed, and the depth of cut to be adjusted. This feedscrew can be engaged, through a gear train, to the <b>feed</b> <b>shaft</b> (mentioned previously) to provide automated 'power feed' movement to the cross-slide. On most lathes, only one direction can be engaged at a time as an interlock mechanism will shut out the second gear train.|$|E
50|$|The {{compound}} rest (or top slide) (2) is usually where {{the tool post}} is mounted. It provides a smaller amount of movement (less than the cross-slide) along its axis via another feedscrew. The {{compound rest}} axis can be adjusted independently of the carriage or cross-slide. It is used for turning tapers, to control depth of cut when screwcutting or precision facing, or to obtain finer feeds (under manual control) than the <b>feed</b> <b>shaft</b> permits. Usually, the compound rest has a protractor marked in its base (2b), enabling the operator to adjust its axis to precise angles.|$|E
5000|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} carriage holds the tool bit and moves it longitudinally (turning) or perpendicularly (facing) {{under the control}} of the operator. The operator moves the carriage manually via the handwheel (5a) or automatically by engaging the <b>feed</b> <b>shaft</b> with the carriage feed mechanism (5c). This provides some relief for the operator as the movement of the carriage becomes power assisted. The handwheels (2a, 3b, 5a) on the carriage and its related slides are usually calibrated, both for ease of use and to assist in making reproducible cuts. Calibration marks will measure either the distance from center (radius), or the work piece's diameter, so for example, on a diameter machine where calibration marks are in thousandths of an inch, the radial handwheel dial will read [...]0005 inches of radius per division, or [...]001 inches of diameter. The carriage typically comprises a top casting, known as the saddle (4), and a side casting, known as the apron (5).|$|E

Through {{woodworking}} four-side planer vibration test, {{this article}} studies its dynamic characteristics and dynamic response {{to identify the}} vibration magnitudes law of each <b>feed</b> roll <b>shafts</b> of the four-side feed beam; then finds the natural frequency and damping ratio of the feed beam and lathe bed; obtains the mathematical model of <b>feed</b> roll <b>shaft</b> vibration magnitude changing with the feed rate U under different process thicknesses. The analysis of feeding quantity and the rationality of lathe bed {{from the perspective of}} vibration design supplies the designs and operation staff with reference data. Overview Woodworking four-side planer is the lathe bed that processes the four sides of wood simultaneously, it can process the molding surface of various shapes, mainly is used to process plate, square timber into four planes or molding surfaces vertically. Processed wood products can obtain their exact sizes, cross-sectional shapes and surface finish, and the machine is a typical process centralized multi-joint lathe. It increases the processing capacity and production efficiency, is a widely applied finishing machine in the wood processing industry. In recent years, many domestic and foreign enterprises have produced a lot of woodworking four-side planers, which are transforming to the direction o...|$|R
40|$|The linear multivariable {{modelling}} of {{an aircraft}} gas turbine is presented. A frequency-domain identification method is employed to estimate {{a family of}} models from engine data at a range of operating points. It is found that the fuel <b>feed</b> to <b>shaft</b> speed dynamics can be represented by second-order models. This matches the results obtained for the reduced-order linearised thermodynamic models derived from the engine physics. A direct comparison can thus be made between the estimated and thermodynamic models, which shows significant discrepancies between them for the engine tested. This work illustrates how modern system identification techniques {{can be used to}} verify engine models. The multivariable framework employed means that additional inputs and outputs can be easily incorporated into the model...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology {{to evaluate the}} technical state of a Francis turbine by shaft rotor dynamic simulation. There are several rotor dynamic criteria that define the technical state of a turbomachine. To <b>feed</b> the <b>shaft</b> rotor dynamic model this delivers the required information to accomplish the technical assessment. The numerical rotor dynamic model uses as input, the field forces obtained by the fluid-solid interaction analysis undertaken over the blades of the runner. The rotor dynamic numerical simulations allow to determinate the record-in-time of the displacements of any point along the shaft. This information is relevant for diagnosis tasks, because {{it is possible to}} decompose it spectrally and to estimate the severity of the vibrations. Comparing the results of the numerical model against those obtained from machines that operates under normal conditions, it is possible to determinate the technical state of the turbomachine. This allows studying the stability of the turbine working on several operation ranges. A Francis turbine is a very complex machine that involves many physical phenomena of different nature. In this way, the hydraulic input forces needed by the rotor dynamic model should not be assumed but calculated directly from the fluid interaction over the turbine structure...|$|R
40|$|The analysis, design, {{and testing}} of the hybrid boost bearing are discussed. The hybrid boost bearing {{consists}} of a fluid film bearing coupled in parallel with a rolling element bearing. This coupling arrangement makes use of the inherent advantages of both the fluid film and rolling element bearing {{and at the same}} time minimizes their disadvantages and limitations. The analytical optimization studies that lead to the final fluid film bearing design are reported. The bearing consisted of a centrifugally-pressurized planar fluid film thrust bearing with oil <b>feed</b> through the <b>shaft</b> center. An analysis of the test ball bearing is also presented.

The sensor attached at steering <b>shaft</b> <b>feed</b> back the degree of steering {{in the form of}} voltage signal together with input signals to the controller. The differential equation of motion for this system is transformed to Laplace domain transfer functions after applying appropriate simplified conditions. Transfer functions relating the steering system are therefore derived and presented. A method for determining the parameters of transfer function of steering motor is proposed in this paper. Simulation and experimental results, which verify the model, are presented to prove its efficiency and simplicity, it will be more efficient to solve such similar transfer function research in the other paralleled control fields.

50|$|The All-Trac {{system had}} five main parts: the front differential, rear differential, center differential, the transmission, and the {{transfer}} case. The transmission, front differential, center differential and transfer case are all one large assembly and {{are connected to}} the transversely mounted engine. The transmission bell housing, front differential and center differential can be separated from the transfer case sub assembly. The transmission output <b>shaft</b> <b>feeds</b> power into the front/center differential assembly (the center differential is contained within the front differential). The front differential distributes the power to the front wheels, while the center differential distributes power to the transfer case that will send power to the rear differential. In most of the models, when the transfer case is not locked the majority of the power is routed to the front wheels as would be in a Toyota FWD automobile.|$|R
5000|$|For {{model year}} 1997, a design update {{occurred}} {{for both the}} Talon and the Eclipse that is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "2Gb". The update was primarily limited to the non-metal portions of the car. The front and rear fascias were heavily revised to incorporate more aggressive looking features. At the front, a larger air intake was created and the [...] "Eagle" [...] emblem was enlarged and embossed {{into the center of the}} bumper cap (as opposed to a badge that inset into a similarly shaped hole). At the rear, a new high-mount spoiler was introduced that projected further into the airstream, replacing the flush-mounted sickle spoiler. Added plastic moldings on the bumper caps and doors completed the revisions to the body. Lastly, on the TSi and TSi AWD models, the aluminum wheels were increased to 17 in and incorporated more angles replacing the 16 in curved 5-spoke wheel. Another important, non-cosmetic change concerned the driveline. There was a slight change in gear ratios and the number of splines on the <b>shaft</b> <b>feeding</b> power to the transfer case was altered.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the concept}} of long range {{prediction}} in the context of self-tuning control theory, a generalized predictive kinetic energy controller (GPKEC) suitable for applications to high speed machining processes is developed. A three dimensional lumped mass model capable of representing both tool and workpiece dynamics in a single point turning operation on a lathe machine is first developed to accurately reflect their interactions in a machining process. Based on the linearized uncoupled one dimensional model for the machining dynamics and noting that feed can effectively be used to control the unstable machine-tool dynamics, a single-input single-output (SISO) discrete time predictive control law (GPKEC) is derived by minimizing the predicted incremental kinetic energy of the cutting process. The instantaneous feed is used as the control variable of this controller which is calculated using the feedback of instantaneous displacement of the tool tip in the feed direction. It is observed from the simulation results that the proposed GPKEC controller is capable of suppressing the unstable and marginally stable system dynamics in their incipient stages, even in the presence of uncertain disturbances. The GPKEC strategy is also found to be robust against modeling or estimation errors. In order to verify the simulation results, a number of experimental runs are carried out. An estimate of acceleration signal, instead of displacement, in the feed direction is used as feedback signal due to practical reasons. A servomotor, which is connected to the main <b>feed</b> drive <b>shaft</b> through a high performance timing (HPT) belt, has been used to control the instantaneous feed of a cutting process. It is observed {{that there has been a}} good agreement between the experimental and simulation results. The experimental results show that the GPKEC strategy can effectively suppress the chatter vibration in a machining process. It is also observed from experimental results that the proposed controller is robust against overparametrization, estimation errors, uncertain inputs, system noise, and even against changes in the system dynamics...|$|R
50|$|Doe Run's U.S. mines {{are all on}} the Viburnum Trend, a 64 km long mineralized {{shoot with}} an average width of 150 meters, {{thickness}} of 3 to 30 meters and average depth of 300 meters. It is a classic Mississippi Valley type lead/zinc deposit in Cambrian carbonate rocks though it contains an unusually high proportion of lead.The principal minerals are galena (lead, PbS) and sphalerite (zinc, ZnS) with lesser amounts of chalcopyrite (copper, CuFeS2). At the end of October 2005, ore reserves were approximately 34 million proven and probable tons at average grades of 6.23% lead, 1.36% zinc and 0.26% copper. As of end October 2006, the company had six production <b>shafts</b> <b>feeding</b> four mills with a combined capacity of 21,000 metric tons per day which produced 255,600 metric tons of lead in concentrate plus zinc and copper byproducts. After closure of the Mississippi River and Bonne Terre Railway, this was transported by public road to the primary lead smelter at Herculaneum, 56 km south of St Louis. It has a capacity of 227,000 metric tons of lead annually but is limited by permit to 181,500 metric tons. 2006 production was 140,300 metric tons of primary lead. The balance of the lead concentrates plus the zinc and copper concentrates were sold to other smelters. One shaft, mill and smelter (Glover) were not in operation.|$|R
50|$|The 624-acre Silver Creek Metro Park {{is tucked}} away in a quiet, rural area near Norton. Observant {{visitors}} will see traces of the past. Open fields, fence rows and a stately old barn, part of which {{dates back to the}} Civil War, are evidence of the park’s former life as the Harter Dairy Farm. Other secrets are less visible. Buried beneath the surface is a maze of tunnels and shafts - remnants of a 19th-century mining operation. The one-time farm has changed a great deal since Metro Parks acquired the land in 1966. Thousands of trees have been planted, and the bathhouse and 50-acre lake - fed by a spring from an old mine near Wall Road - were built in the early 1990s. Today, iron-laden water from the mine <b>shafts</b> <b>feed</b> into Silver Creek, coating the bottom of the stream with reddish-brown iron-oxide, yet fish, frogs and other animals thrive. The open fields are home to woodcocks, meadowlarks and eastern bluebirds. Many butterflies flutter among the flowers and grasses. Hawks circle overhead to hunt rabbits, mice and voles living in the grasses and weeds below. Deer travel among the woods, fields and wetlands. Tall sycamores grow in soggy areas, and hickory woods grow in drier spots. The beech-maple woods contain spring wildflowers. One of the largest northern red oaks in Summit County - 20 feet in circumference - stands in this park.|$|R
40|$|A rotary tuner {{has been}} {{developed}} and tested in a 425 -MHz ramped gradient drift-tube linac and also in a 350 -MHz DTL cold model tank. This type of tuner utilizes a rotary paddle to displace the magnetic field at the tank wall to vary the inductance and resonant frequency of the drift-tube linac. The tuning paddle effective area is about 7 % of the cross-sectional area of the DTL tank and shifts the resonant frequency by about 350 kHz for 90 ” of rotation. Advantages of the tuner include low friction for fast. and accurate response, no RF seals, low wall currents at the shaft feedthrough, and minimal cutout volume at the tank wall. The small cutout volume is important in applications in which tank wall cooling is critical. A smaller helium-cooled version of this device is being developed for use in 850 -MHz, cryogenically cooled drift-tube linacs. Description of the Kotary Tuner A water-cooled version of the rotary tuner is shown in Fig. 1. This device was developed for the 425 -MHz ramped gradient drift-tube linac (RGDTL). The paddle is 12. 7 x 7. 6 X 0. 7 cm thick and cooled using 0. 32 -cm refrigerator tubing soldered between two copper sheets. The drive shaft is 0. 95 cm OD, double-walled copper tubing. The rotary tuner was developed experimentally to replace an existing slug tuner so the drive <b>shaft</b> <b>feeds</b> through a thick copper adapter flange designed to fit the original slug tuner port. The shaft is vacuum sealed with a Ferrofluidic bearing and is belt driven with a stepper motor. The paddle can be overdriven because the tuning effect is approximately sinusoidal and repetitive. Thus, unlike a slug tuner, no limit switches are required. In normal operation, the tuner is driven to maintain the DTL resonance {{close enough to the}} drive frequency so that VSWR limits are not exceeded. A cryogenically cooled version of a rotary tuner has been designed for an 850 -MHz DTL and is shown in Fig. 2...|$|R
