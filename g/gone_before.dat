25|$|The baggy sound {{influenced}} numerous Manchester bands including James, the Charlatans (formed in Birmingham) and the Mock Turtles. However, in {{the early}} 1990s the sound spread across the country, with bands such as the Farm, EMF, Flowered Up, Candy Flip and Blur treading where Mancunians had <b>gone</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E

25|$|Other new {{construction}} continued in previously established styles. In 1911 and 1913 respectively, new brick commercial buildings went up at 189 and 205 Main in the Renaissance Revival style. Their application differed {{from those that}} had <b>gone</b> <b>before.</b> On 189 was a belt course and stone quoins; on the other building all the decoration, including the flat-arched lintels and corbeled cornice, was brick.|$|E

25|$|Wright {{made her}} last {{trip in the}} spring of 1865, in command of Capt. Thomas Stump, with Capt. William Gray as pilot, who {{attempted}} to take her above the Snake River rapids to Farewell Bend. She was eight days in making a distance of about 100 miles, then headed down stream and returned to Lewiston in less than five hours. Captain Stump reported his explorations as having been of no practical value; but he had taken a steamer farther {{into the heart of the}} regions lying to the east than any craft had ever <b>gone</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with what}} had <b>gone</b> <b>before</b> and what {{followed}} {{it was a}} small, low-cost affair. The approach was from {{the north side of}} the mountain and the climbing was planned to be after the monsoon. The monsoon was unusually late that year and, beset by the weather and in difficult conditions of snow, little was achieved regarding the summit. However, a very large number of lesser peaks were climbed for the first time and a southern route up the Western Cwm was identified as a possible line of approach if Nepal could ever be persuaded to change its policy of not admitting climbers.|$|E
25|$|Before {{recording}} {{their next}} album, the band {{decided to take}} a break to find time to focus on other projects. Nicke Andersson worked on his side project The Solution with Scott Morgan, releasing the album Communicate! in 2004; he also contributed backing vocals for The Cardigans album Long <b>Gone</b> <b>Before</b> Daylight. Dahlqvist started a side project called Thunder Express and also recorded the album Fula Gubben Hitler with Swedish singer/songwriter Stefan Sundström; Dahlqvist was pictured on the album's cover suspended on a cross. Dahlqvist also toured along with former Hellacopters member Mattias Hellberg in support of the album.|$|E

25|$|Richmond {{dominated}} the 1967 season, running out winners {{in a classic}} Grand Final against Geelong. In his first two years, the team lost only seven games and Hafey had gone from an unknown coach in the bush to the toast of the football world. In hindsight, the 1967 premiership marked {{a turning point for}} the game. The Tigers were fitter than any team that had <b>gone</b> <b>before</b> and were the highest scoring team since 1950. Australian football, after two decades of defensive-based play, was about to enter an era of high scoring, aided by rule changes, new tactics and betters standards of fitness.|$|E
25|$|The Spaniards found a solidly-built well {{used by the}} Indians {{to provide}} {{themselves}} with fresh water and they could fill their casks and jugs. The Indians, again with friendly aspect and manner, brought them to their village, where once more they could see solid constructions and many idols (Bernal alludes to the painted figures of serpents on the walls, so characteristic of Mesoamerica). They also met their first priests, with their white tunics and their long hair impregnated with human blood; this {{was the end of}} the Indians' friendly conduct: they convoked a great number of warriors and ordered them to burn some dry reeds, indicating to the Spaniards that if they weren't <b>gone</b> <b>before</b> the fire went out, they would be attacked. Hernández's men decided to retreat to the boats with their casks and jugs of water before the Indians could attack them, leaving safely behind them the discovery of Campeche.|$|E
25|$|Stowers made {{a strong}} start to her {{professional}} career with a national title at the 2015 USA Indoor Track and Field Championships. Her winning time of 7.84 seconds took {{a tenth of a}} second off her previous best for the 60m hurdles. No longer having to do both academics and sport, her new focus on hurdling brought results at the Drake Relays, where she moved up to twelfth on the all-time lists with a new personal record of 12.40 seconds – three tenths faster than she had <b>gone</b> <b>before.</b> She also defeated former Olympic champion Dawn Harper-Nelson and world champion Brianna Rollins in the process. She improved one hundredth further at the Jamaica International Invitational, with a meeting record of 12.39 seconds. Her debut appearance on the 2015 IAAF Diamond League circuit established her as an elite international performer. She won the Doha Diamond League meeting in a series record time of 12.35 seconds – this moved her up to seventh on the all-time rankings for the 100m hurdles.|$|E

25|$|From {{the end of}} June 1942, the Fw 190 A-3/U3 Jabo (Jagdbomber, fighter-bomber) {{equipped}} 10.(Jabo)/JG 2 and 10.(Jabo)/JG 26, which operated {{with considerable}} success attacking shipping and port towns around the south-eastern coasts of England. These high-speed, low-altitude attacks were almost impossible to defend against, as the Fw 190s came in below effective radar coverage and were often <b>gone</b> <b>before</b> RAF fighters could intercept them. The most successful of these fighter-bomber operations was carried out on 31 October 1942 on Canterbury in retaliation for RAF bombing raids over Germany. In the largest daylight raid mounted by the Luftwaffe since the Battle of Britain, about 70 Fw 190s unloaded 30 bombs on the city, killing 32 people and injuring 116, as well as causing {{a lot of damage}} to residential properties and shops. Only one Fw 190 was lost over England. The most successful RAF fighters used to intercept these attacks were the Hawker Typhoons and the Griffon-engine Spitfire Mk XIIs, which were both fast enough to catch the Fw 190, especially at low altitudes.|$|E
25|$|It {{is at this}} point, the {{beginning}} of 1907, that I propose to bring this first volume to an end. The 25-year-old Picasso is about to conjure up a quintet of Dionysiac Demoiselles on his huge new canvas. The execution of this painting would make a dramatic climax to these pages. However, it would imply that Picasso's great revolutionary work constitutes a conclusion to all that has <b>gone</b> <b>before.</b> It does not. For all that the Demoiselles is rooted in Picasso's past, {{not to speak of}} such precursors as the Iron Age Iberians, El Greco, Gauguin and Cézanne, it is essentially a beginning: the most innovative painting since Giotto. As we will see in the next volume, it established a new pictorial syntax; it enabled people to perceive things with new eyes, new minds, new awareness. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon is the first unequivocally 20th-century masterpiece, a principal detonator of the modern movement, the cornerstone of 20th-century art. For Picasso it would also be a rite of passage: what he called an exorcism.' It cleared the way for cubism. It likewise banished the artist's demons. Later, these demons would return and require further exorcism. For the next decade, however, Picasso would feel as free and creative and 'as overworked' as God.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} page, the rich golden burial {{sites of the}} Zenú are described, {{as well as the}} routes inland from later Venezuela, that was conquered by German conquistadors. The next {{paragraph}} narrates about the start of the main expedition inland from Santa Marta, leaving the city in the month of April 1536. It is said Gonzalo Ximénez de Quesada left with 600 men, divided into 8 groups of infantry, 10 groups of cavalry and a number of brigs on the Magdalena River. De Quesada and his troops marched over land {{on the bank of the}} river. Names of the captains in the army of De Quesada are given as San Martín (Juan de Sanct Martín), Céspedes (Juan de Céspedes), Valençuela (Pedro Fernández de Valenzuela), Lázaro Fonte, Librixa (Antonio de Lebrija), Juan de(l) Junco and Suarex (Gonzalo Suárez Rendón). The captains heading the brigs are named as Corral (Francisco Gómez del Corral), Cardosso (Antonio Díaz de Cardoso) and Albarracín (Juan de Albarracín). The troops went out of free will and consent of the governor of Santa Marta; Pedro de Lugo, after the death of García de Lerma. The troops went under command of Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada. The third page describes that the troops spent more than a year and more than 100 leguas on their journey. They reached La Tora , farther than any soldier had <b>gone</b> <b>before,</b> after 150 leguas. The expedition took so long because of the waters and the narrow passages of the surrounding area.|$|E

Realizing that he was outnumbered and outgunned, Castañeda led his troops back to San Antonio de Béxar. The troops were <b>gone</b> <b>before</b> the Texians finished reloading. In his report to Ugartechea, Castañeda wrote [...] "since the orders from your Lordship were for me to withdraw without compromising the honor of Mexican arms, I did so".|$|E
500|$|James Berardinelli, {{reviewing}} {{the film in}} 1996, felt that the pace dragged and the plot bore too close a resemblance to the original series episode [...] "", but considered the start {{and end of the}} film to be strong. Terry Lee Rioux, Kelley's biographer, noted that the film proved [...] "that it was the character-driven play that made all the difference in Star Trek". The slow pacing, extended reaction shots, and the film's lack of action scenes led fans and critics to give the film a variety of nicknames, including The Motionless Picture, The Slow Motion Picture, The Motion Sickness, and Where Nomad [...] Has <b>Gone</b> <b>Before.</b>|$|E
