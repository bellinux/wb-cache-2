5|$|According to Peter Freuchen, {{the scene}} in which the wolf attacks Mala is real. Freuchen says that Mala, armed with {{a rock and a}} pistol beneath his fur jacket, spent three afternoons trying to lure a wolf into attacking him. A rifleman and a cinematographer using a camera with a {{telephoto}} lens <b>followed</b> <b>at</b> a distance. The wolf attack was filmed from far away, with the rifleman ready to shoot the wolf in case Mala was unable to kill it. As shown in film, Mala was able to kill the wolf without using his pistol or relying on the rifleman, and was not injured in the attack.|$|E
5|$|As {{traffic levels}} increased, {{bottlenecks}} at the two-lane tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{became a major}} problem. By the late 1950s, traffic jams formed at the tunnels, especially during the summer. In 1959, four Senators urged state officials {{to work with the}} turnpike commission to study ways to reduce the traffic jams. That year, the commission began studies aimed at resolving the traffic jams at the Laurel Hill and Allegheny Mountain tunnels; studies for the other tunnels <b>followed.</b> <b>At</b> the conclusion of the studies, the turnpike commission planned to make the entire turnpike four lanes by either adding a second tube at the tunnels or bypassing them. The new and upgraded tunnel tubes would feature white tiles, fluorescent lighting, and upgraded ventilation.|$|E

5|$|City's season {{opened with}} a 0–0 draw at home to Liverpool. City were awarded a penalty, but new captain Tony Book hit it wide. Two defeats <b>followed,</b> <b>at</b> Southampton and Stoke. The Stoke defeat led to a {{tactical}} switch. Mike Summerbee, who played wide on the right {{at the start of}} the season, was moved to centre-forward. The change reaped immediate dividends, with Summerbee playing a leading role in a 4–2 win against Southampton. This was the first in a run of five straight wins, after which Manchester City had caught up with the league leaders. During this run of wins young winger Stan Bowles made his league debut, scoring twice in a 5–2 win against Sheffield United.|$|E

Initially, another blast was reported in the stationary Shivganga Express bound for Delhi.|$|E
5|$|The Canandaigua–Pultneyville highway {{served as}} a post road {{in the years that}} <b>followed.</b> <b>At</b> some point, the section of the highway between Palmyra and Marion, {{initially}} a corduroy road, was rebuilt as a plank road and tolled. The highway fell into disrepair over the years, leading travelers to conceive ways to avoid paying toll. The toll booths were eventually removed, and the road was later covered with dirt and converted into a stage road. By the 1920s, the state of New York had assumed ownership of the Canandaigua–Pultneyville highway. In the mid-1920s, it became part of NY72, a north–south highway extending from NY52 in Naples to the Lake Ontario shoreline in Pultneyville by way of the western side of Canandaigua Lake.|$|E
