5|$|As of November 2009, Wong Fu Productions {{has created}} more than 130 short films and music videos. Because the <b>group</b> <b>does</b> {{not require a}} fee to view its films, it gains a salary from being a YouTube partner, draws profits from {{merchandise}} sales, public speaking on university campuses, and music video production for rising Asian American artists.|$|E
5|$|JC's Girls (short for Jesus Christ's Girls, {{also called}} the JC's Girls Girls Girls Ministry) is an Evangelical Christian women's {{organization}} in the United States whose members evangelize to female workers in the sex industry. The organization supports women wishing to leave the industry, but does not try to persuade them to do so. The <b>group</b> <b>does</b> not focus upon conversion but rather on communicating its message that Christians exist who are not judging female sex workers {{and are willing to}} accept them. The organization also helps both women and men seeking to overcome pornography addiction.|$|E

50|$|Fuchsian {{groups are}} used to create Fuchsian models of Riemann surfaces. In this case, the group may be called the Fuchsian group of the surface. In some sense, Fuchsian <b>groups</b> <b>do</b> for non-Euclidean {{geometry}} what crystallographic <b>groups</b> <b>do</b> for Euclidean geometry. Some Escher graphics are based on them (for the disc model of hyperbolic geometry).|$|R

25|$|Zawahiri {{has said}} in an {{interview}} that the <b>group</b> <b>does</b> not have women combatants and that a woman's role is limited to caring for the homes and children of al-Qaeda fighters.

25|$|In PTV's Network Development plan, {{released}} April 2013, {{it revealed}} that the timetable change introduced in 2011 created a sub-group known as the Cross-City group, which consists of the Werribee/Williamstown line and the Frankston line. This <b>group</b> <b>does</b> not have a loop tunnel, rather, it runs straight through Flinders street and Southern Cross using the outer viaduct. During weekdays, most trains from Frankston run through Flinders Street and terminate at either Werribee or Williamstown, and vice versa. During peak hours, either trains may terminate and reverse. During weekends, this <b>group</b> <b>does</b> not operate, instead being fed into their former respective loops. The group's creation {{is part of a}} plan to create through-running lines across the CBD to facilitate easier transfers for commuters that wish to travel from the western suburbs to the eastern suburbs.|$|E

25|$|The Coryphoideae are {{the most}} diverse {{subfamily}}, and are a paraphyletic group, meaning {{all members of the}} group share a common ancestor, but the <b>group</b> <b>does</b> not include all the ancestor's descendants. Most palms in this subfamily have palmately lobed leaves and solitary flowers with three, or sometimes four carpels. The fruit normally develops from only one carpel.|$|E
25|$|NOM {{executive}} director Brown {{has stated that}} the <b>group</b> <b>does</b> not release donor names to prevent donor intimidation by proponents of same-sex marriage. The group used that argument in an unsuccessful lawsuit seeking to exempt them from California's disclosure laws. On March 2, 2015, the United States Supreme Court turned down an appeal of this case, bringing it to an end.|$|E

We can solve both problems using a more abstract definition of the exponential map that works for all Lie groups, as follows.|$|E

After obtaining the coordinates, Quinn sends Rembrandt and Wade through a vortex leading back to Earth Prime, opting to stay behind with Maggie. Maggie eventually offers to risk her life returning to their Earth, but when she and Quinn open a vortex, they find themselves in yet another alternate Earth.|$|E

They are treated with a quinolone active against streptococcus pneumoniae (such as levofloxacin) or a β-lactam antibiotic (such as cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) and a macrolide antibiotic, such as azithromycin or clarithromycin, for seven to ten days.|$|E

25|$|The chorus {{was founded}} by gay music pioneer Jon Reed Sims. Despite popular misconceptions, the <b>group</b> <b>does</b> not require that members {{identify}} as gay or bisexual.

Today, with a membership of over 300 voices, the SFGMC continues to present a wide range of music and perform for many different kinds of audiences.|$|E
25|$|Immigrant {{children}} and youths, mostly of lower-class background, are the fastest-growing {{segment of the}} German population. So their prospects bear heavily on {{the well-being of the}} country. More than 30% of Germans aged 15 years and younger have at least one parent born abroad. In the big cities, 60% of children aged 5 years and younger have at least one parent born abroad. Immigrant children academically underperform their peers. Immigrants have tended to be less educated than native Germans. After controlling for parental education, ethnic <b>group</b> <b>does</b> not play a role in children's academic outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Political and {{economic}} power remain vested {{in the hands of}} the local elite, most of whom are either white, light-skinned Creole, or Mestizo. The sizable middle group is composed of peoples of different ethnic backgrounds. This middle <b>group</b> <b>does</b> not constitute a unified social class, but rather a number of middle-class and working-class groups, loosely oriented around shared dispositions toward education, cultural respectability, and possibilities for upward social mobility. These beliefs and the social practices they engender, help distinguish the middle group from the grass roots majority of the Belizean people.|$|E
