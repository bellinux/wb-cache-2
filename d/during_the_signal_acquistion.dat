40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a simple and}} effective concept for aiding <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> <b>acquistion</b> of a GPS receiver in sounding rocket applications. A segmented, low-order polynomial representation of the norminal flight path is employed to provide the receiver with approximate position and velocity values of the host vehicle. These are used for an open-loop Doppler and visibility prediction, which in turn assists the channel allocation and code search. The prosposed concept has been implemented in the 12 -channel GPS Orion receiver, which employs Mitel`s GP 2000 chipset and suports firmware modifications via the Architect developer kit. Using hardware-in-the-loop simulations in a GPS <b>signal</b> simulator testbed, <b>the</b> modified receiver`s robustness against temporary signal losses has been demonstrated.

40|$|Some {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that environmental unpredictability, accompanied by some sort of signal for behavioral conditioning, can boost activity or foster exploratory behavior, which may increase post-release success in re-introduction programs. Thus, using white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), a vulnerable Neotropical species, as a model, we evaluated an unpredictable feeding schedule. Associating this with the effect of classical conditioning on behavioral activities, we assessed the inclusion of this approach in pre-release training protocols. The experimental design comprised predictable feeding phases (control phases: C 1, C 2 and C 3) and unpredictable feeding phases (U 1 - signaled and U 2 - non-signaled). The animals explored more <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>signaled</b> and non-signaled unpredictable phases and <b>during</b> <b>the</b> second control phase (C 2) than <b>during</b> <b>the</b> other two predictable phases (C 1 and C 3).
