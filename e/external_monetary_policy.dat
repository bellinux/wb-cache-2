40|$|For a year {{following}} {{the launch of}} the euro, the European Central Bank (ECB) seemed indifferent to the currency’s depreciation. Then the ECB changed to a policy position of trying to bolster the external value of the euro. This paper seeks to explain these patterns of positions on the ECB’s <b>external</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy.</b> I argue that the ECB’s policy on the exchange rate is a function of its commitment to domes-tic price stability in the euro zone. In other words, the ECB’s concern with the euro’s exchange rate centers solely on what that exchange rate can do to inflation. This focus on price stability {{is a function of the}} interests of the ECB in main-taining its own image of competence in European society...|$|E
40|$|The European Union is the worldâ??s largest {{economic}} entity, {{with half}} a billion people and a gross domestic product slightly larger than the United States. It is the largest exporter, the largest foreign aid donor, the largest source of foreign investment, and a magnet for migrants. But its decision-making powers are often fragmented and ineffective. To date {{there has been no}} comprehensive study of European international economic relations. This book fills that gap. It examines the main areas of Europeâ??s foreign economic policy: trade, development, external competition policy, external financial markets, <b>external</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy,</b> migration and external energy/environment policy.

Adopting a theoretical research position, we aim at identifying the main <b>external</b> factors to <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> and discuss {{the ways in which}} these factors alter the economic environment and implicitly the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> transmission mechanism. This is done by changing the way in which monetary transmission channels work and deliver <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> decisions throughout the economy, with the final goal of producing central bank desired outcomes with regard to economic variables like inflation, employment, or the production level. We will begin this article with a brief introduction on the topic of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy,</b> the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> transmission mechanism and the potential external factors that may influence the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> and the functioning of its transmission mechanism. The main external factors are identified as linked to fiscal policy, commodity prices, financial market volatility or other globalization related processes.

As we will see in the study and highlight in our conclusion, the external factors cause decisive changes in the way <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> is transmitted, and thus will strongly influence the decisions that central banks take in order to alter key economic variables. The profound understanding of how these non-central bank controlled factors influence the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> transmission mechanism is a key requirement for central banks, as only by being able to predict, recognize and evaluate the effects of current or future external factors can they succeed in reaching their <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> objectives...|$|R

A sizable fraction of macroeconomic fluctuations in emerging markets is attributable to external shocks (in many cases more than 50 %). External factors are dichotomized into “U.

40|$|I provide {{empirical}} evidence {{of changes in}} the U. S. Treasury yield curve and related macroeconomic factors, and investigate whether the changes are brought about by <b>external</b> shocks, <b>monetary</b> <b>policy,</b> or by both. To explore this, I characterize bond market exposures to macroeconomic and <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> risks, using an equilibrium term structure model with recursive preferences in which inflation dynamics are endogenously determined. In my model, the key risks that affect bond market prices are changes in the correlation between growth and inflation and changes in the conduct of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy.</b> Using a novel estimation technique, I find that the changes in <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> affect the level of bond yields through their effect on expected inflation, while the changes in the correlation between growth and inflation affect both the level as well as the volatility of bond yields. Consequently, the changes in the correlation structure are the main contributor to bond risk premia and to bond market volatility. The time variations within a regime and risks associated with moving across regimes lead to the failure of the Expectations Hypothesis and to the excess bond return predictability regression of Cochrane and Piazzesi (2005), as in the data. ∗ Link to the latest version.

Further, international interest rate differentials around FOMC meeting dates tend to be negative for short maturities with the impact gradually dissipating as bond maturity increases. Finally, for the case of Singapore, we find that domestic interest rates react to both <b>external</b> and domestic <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> announcements with a magnitude that is larger over the full bond maturity spectrum for domestic announcements.

It is also fundamental to discuss the transmission mechanisms (from a Neokeynesian perspective), the basic concepts to understand the policy retards, and to bring to end the theoretical review, it is studied Poole ‘s analysis about the decision of taking monetary attachés or the interest rate as instruments of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy.</b> Within the methodological scope, the technique of Granger’s causation, different methods to apply the “ econometrics of retards” (Kyock, PDL and VAR) and Chow’s test of structural change are reviewed. Finally, in the conclusions, the author propounds the necessary variables for a further approach of the empiric analysis (statistical and econometric) of the problem which takes up our attention as well as the techniques that could be used and the length of their study. <b>Monetary</b> <b>Policy.</b> Growth.

40|$|This study {{estimates}} the interdependence between South Africa‟s <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> and stock market performance, utilising structural vector autoregression (SVAR) methodology. The study finds that a stock price shock which decrease stock prices by 100 basis points leads to 5 basis points decrease in interbank rate. A <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> shock {{that increases the}} interbank rate by l percent leads to decrease in real stock prices by 1 percent. This result for South Africa {{is similar to the}} result by Bjornland and Leteimo (2009) which earlier concluded that there was a high interdependence between interest rate setting and stock prices. However the magnitude of the relationship is relatively lower for South Africa compared to that of the United States of America (USA). The result of the current study is also very much consistent with the argument that the South African stock market is resource-based and so is influenced by <b>external</b> shocks, meaning <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> shock does not have as much impact on stock market in South Africa as in the USA. However the SARB may have to consider watching movements in stock prices so that booms in stock markets do not defeat central bank <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> thrusts. The stock price market is an essential source of information for <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|Applying {{techniques}} of clustering analysis {{to a set}} of variables suggested by the convergence criteria and the theory of optimal currency areas, this paper looks for country homogeneities to assess membership in the existing and proposed monetary unions of the broader west African region. Our analysis reveals considerable dissimilarities in the economic characteristics of the countries in west and central Africa. In particular, the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) countries do not form a cluster with the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) countries; and, within the WAMZ, there is a significant lack of homogeneity. Furthermore, when west and central African countries are considered together, we find significant heterogeneities within the CFA franc zone, and some interesting similarities between the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) and WAMZ countries. Overall, our findings raise some questions about the geographical boundaries of several existing and proposed monetary unions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Czech approach to inflation targeting (IT) that was co-authored {{by the authors}} of the paper. The IT strategy was introduced by the Czech National Bank in 1997. The paper gives an overview of history of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> in the Czech Republic and reasons for a change in strategy. Similarly to the countries that adopted the inflation targeting, the Czech republic lost its nominal anchor when letting domestic currency to float. Monetary targeting was not an option due to weaker links between both the price level and money supply a well as money supply and interest rates. In the next section, the paper describes the problems of implementation of inflation targeting in transitional country and solutions adopted by the Czech National Bank. Specifically, the issue of regulated prices is discussed and definition of the net inflation index. Also, the strategy of desinflation and its representation by a set of two targets for different time horizons is analyzed. The overview of the first months of decision-making process under the new strategy shows that it promotes both internal as well as <b>external</b> transparency of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy.</b> In the last section, several lessons are derived for inflation targeters in transitional countries from the Czech experience. For example, the importance on society preferences towards price and currency stability is emphasized. Also, the conflict between a necessity of anchoring expectations and longer lags of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> is explained. It is concluded that despite the problems, the inflation targeting provides significant gains for transitional economy. inflation targeting czech...|$|R
