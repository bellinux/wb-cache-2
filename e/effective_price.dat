5|$|The size of {{the rebound}} effect is {{determined}} by the price elasticity of demand for the good. In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the <b>effective</b> <b>price</b> of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is price elastic), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.|$|E
5|$|Up to January 2011, {{market prices}} for NZ Units were largely {{set by the}} {{international}} price for Certified Emission Reduction (CER) units. In March 2011, European concerns over {{the implications of the}} Fukushima nuclear disaster for their nuclear reactors reduced atomic power generation and increased coal thermal generation. This caused extra demand for CERs in the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and CER prices exceeded $NZ25 a tonne, the <b>effective</b> <b>price</b> cap in the NZ ETS. NZ buyers switched from the more expensive CERS to cheaper NZUs which were traded at a record price of more than NZ$21 per tonne. In July 2011, concerns over the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis combined with the high volumes of CERS being issued caused international CER prices to fall to a range between 9 and 10 euros. NZU prices fell to $NZ16.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we analyse how double auction marketplaces set an <b>effective</b> <b>pricing</b> {{policy to}} {{determine}} the transaction prices for matched buyers and sellers. We analyse this problem by considering continuous privately known trader types. Furthermore, we consider two typical pricing policies: equilibrium k pricing policy and discriminatory k pricing policy. We firstly investigate how {{to determine the}} transaction prices to reach the maximal allocative efficiency in an isolated marketplace when the traders adopt Bayes-Nash equilibrium bidding strategies. We find that when the marketplace adopts discriminatory k pricing policy, the maximal allocative efficiency is reached by setting k = 0. 41 or 0. 59. We find that equilibrium k pricing policy provides higher allocative efficiency than discriminatory k pricing policy. We further discuss how different pricing policies can affect traders' Bayes-Nash equilibrium bidding strategies. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to the setting with two marketplaces competing against each other to attract traders. We find that the marketplace using equilibrium k pricing policy {{is more likely to}} beat the marketplace using discriminatory k pricing policy, where all traders converge to the marketplace using equilibrium k pricing policy in Bayes-Nash equilibrium. Our analysis can provide meaningful insights for designing an <b>effective</b> <b>pricing</b> policy...|$|R

40|$|The way how {{we choose}} our pricing {{strategy}} {{has a significant}} impact on company’s success. Nowadays companies more and more adopt a new way of thinking in pricing, namely pricing for a long term period in order to bring higher profitability, to build an efficient pricing strategy. Marketers have only recently begun to focus seriously on <b>effective</b> <b>pricing.</b> These companies are the so called progressive companies. They have begun doing more than just worrying about pricing. To increase profitability many are abandoning traditional reactive pricing procedures in favor of proactive pricing, making explicit corporate decisions to change their focus to growth in top-line sales to growth in profitability. The long-term implications of price strategies are still under-researched, and managers should be aware of shifts in customer reactions that may result from frequent adoption of certain strategies. The company pricing strategy should be seen in relation to developments in the company variables, internal ones (capital strength, competencies, organizational conditions, efficiency of the work force etc.) as well as external ones (customers, competitors, the technological development etc.), adopting strategic pricing. In this paper I will present the most <b>effective</b> <b>pricing</b> strategies leading to long term profitability, and also suggest practical conditions for pricing strategies to maximize profit in the long run. knowledge management, human resources management...|$|R
