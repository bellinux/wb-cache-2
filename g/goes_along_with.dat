5|$|Mike visits Zoe in prison, despite Lydia {{manipulating}} him, and Zoe is able {{to convince}} him that she was not to blame for Sarah's death. During her trial, Mike tells the court he believes his daughter committed suicide, and Zoe is found not guilty and is released. She then decides to expose Lydia as Sarah's killer. Zoe moves in with Mike and Lydia, and tells Lydia that her feelings towards her have changed. The pair share a kiss, just as Mike and Amy walk in. Mike then tells Zoe to leave. Lydia discovers that Zoe is using her, and plots revenge. On New Year's Eve, she gets Zoe to meet her in a church, so they can admit their 'relationship' to Sarah. Zoe initially <b>goes</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> this, but then changes her mind, runs out and is knocked unconscious. Zoe {{is able to}} get a confession from Lydia, before running away again.

Nilin makes her way into Scylla's office and enters her mind, remixing {{the memory of a}} car crash which left her with a bitter taste against the world. As she changes the memory to make Scylla a more compassionate person, Nilin discovers that she is Scylla's daughter. Nilin is then told by Edge to head for the Bastille basements to save Bad Request, who has been taken captive. She finds Bad Request, but discovers that his memory has been fully wiped. It is revealed that Memorize scientist Doctor Quaid means to control the Leapers through their Sensens and thus breed a private army for Memorize. However, Johnny Greenteeth, a former co-worker of Quaid's who was experimented on and turned into a Leaper, kills Quaid and prepares to self-destruct the Bastille. Bad Request helps Nilin take down Johnny at the cost of his life and Nilin escapes the destroyed facility.|$|E

According to linear response theory, the Fourier transform of K or G describes how the system returns to equilibrium after an external perturbation; for this reason, the dispersion step in the GHz..THz region is also called structural relaxation. According to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, relaxation towards equilibrium is intimately connected to fluctuations in equilibrium. The density fluctuations associated with sound waves can be experimentally observed by Brillouin scattering.|$|E

25|$|The Winters court {{reasoned}} that water rights were {{implied in the}} agreement {{that had been made}} with the American Indians in 1888, when the reservation was created. This agreement stated that the Fort Belknap Reservation had been created with the intention of the tribal people being able to become self-sufficient. The court noted that land without water has no value, especially when the purpose of a land was to help a group become self-supporting in the way of agriculture. Therefore, a reservation of water <b>goes</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> the reservation of the land. Water rights may be implied from American Indian reservations made by presidential executive order, or American Indian reservations which are created by an act of Congress. Other implications of this court case include setting more of a standard for American Indian water rights along with setting a precedent for later Supreme Court cases which deal with implied water rights.|$|E

25|$|As Prof. Okishio himself acknowledged, his {{argument}} {{is based on}} a comparative static analysis. His starting point is an equilibrium growth path of an economy with a given technique. In a given branch of industry, a technical improvement is introduced (in a way similar to what Marx described) and then the new equilibrium growth path is established under the assumption that the new technique is generally adopted by the capitalists of that branch. The result is that even under Marx's assumptions about technical progress, the new equilibrium growth path <b>goes</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> a higher rate of profit. However, if one drops the assumption that a capitalist economy moves from one equilibrium to another, this result no longer holds. There is no real evidence that capitalist development spontaneously tends to equilibrium, since there are continuously market fluctuations, mismatches of supply and demand, and periodic economic crises. In addition perfect competition does not exist, and corporations may actively try to block competitors in their markets (e.g. European Union Microsoft competition case).|$|E
25|$|Pakistanis {{generally}} eat {{three meals}} a day, which are breakfast, lunch, and dinner. During the evening, many families have tea without sugar, which <b>goes</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> baked/fried snacks from a local bakery (or prepared at home). During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, the eating patterns change to sehri and iftar. It is considered proper to eat only with the right hand as per Islamic tradition (also a tradition in many other Asian cultures). Many Pakistani families, particularly when guests are too many to fit at a table, eat sitting at a cloth known as Dastarkhān, which is {{spread out on the}} floor. In Pakistan, many street eateries serve food on a takht, in a style similar to what is seen in Afghanistan. A takht is a raised platform, where people eat their food sitting cross-legged, after taking their shoes off. Most Pakistanis used to eat on a takht. Pakistanis often eat with their hands, scooping up solid food along with sauce with a piece of baked bread (naan) or rice.|$|E

500|$|Eager {{to explore}} the music video medium, Stipe secured funding for a short film that would {{accompany}} music from {{the first half of}} Reckoning. Stipe's concept was to film the project at folk artist R.A. Miller's Whirlgig Farm, and he recruited Athens filmmaker James Herbert to direct it. In March 1984 R.E.M. filmed Left of Reckoning at the Whirlgig Farm in Rabbittown, Georgia. The short film draws its title {{from the fact that it}} is soundtracked by five songs that appear on the [...] "L" [...] side of the vinyl version of Reckoning: [...] "Harborcoat", [...] "7 Chinese Bros.", [...] "So. Central Rain (I'm Sorry)", [...] "Pretty Persuasion", [...] "Time After Time (AnnElise)", in addition to [...] "Second Guessing" [...] from the R side. In contrast to standard music video imagery, the film consists primarily of footage of the band members wandering around the farm, while Herbert utilizes close-ups, silhouettes, and slow motion footage. Herbert utilized rephotography during the editing process, which involved taking photographs of film frames at random, while also closing in or pulling back from the image with no regard to narrative. According to Buck, [...] "It was really inexpensive to make and kind of fun. We just asked [...] to edit something to four minutes' length, but he's used to making 20-minute films, that's the length he works in. He just made this film that <b>goes</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> the first side of the record." [...] While MTV did not air the complete film, the channel's program The Cutting Edge (funded by I.R.S.) aired the [...] "Time After Time (AnnElise)" [...] segment, and the snippet featuring [...] "Pretty Persuasion" [...] was aired by other music programs.|$|E
