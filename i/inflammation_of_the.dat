5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (<b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cervix) or vaginitis (<b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (<b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thyroid {{is called}} thyroiditis. Inflamed thyroids may cause {{symptoms}} of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Two types thyroiditis initially present with hyperthyroidism and are sometimes {{followed by a}} period of hypothyroidism – Hashimoto's thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis. There are other disorders that cause <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thyroid, and these include subacute thyroiditis, acute thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis, Riedel's thyroiditis and traumatic injury, including palpation thyroiditis.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{infected}} with H. pylori have a 10 to 20% lifetime {{risk of developing}} peptic ulcers and a 1 to 2% risk of acquiring stomach cancer. <b>Inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyloric antrum {{is more likely to}} lead to duodenal ulcers, while <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corpus (body of the stomach) is more likely to lead to gastric ulcers and gastric carcinoma. However, H. pylori possibly plays a role only in the first stage that leads to common chronic inflammation, but not in further stages leading to carcinogenesis. A meta-analysis conducted in 2009 concluded the eradication of H. pylori reduces gastric cancer risk in previously infected individuals, suggesting the continued presence of H. pylori constitutes a relative risk factor of 65% for gastric cancers; in terms of absolute risk, the increase was from 1.1% to 1.7%.|$|E
5|$|Pulpitis (<b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pulp) can be {{triggered}} by various stimuli (insults), including mechanical, thermal, chemical, and bacterial irritants, or rarely barometric changes and ionizing radiation.

5|$|The term {{pneumonia}} {{is sometimes}} more broadly applied to any condition resulting in <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lungs (caused for example by autoimmune diseases, chemical burns or drug reactions); however, this inflammation is more accurately {{referred to as}} pneumonitis.|$|E
5|$|A {{pulmonary}} embolism is {{a blood clot}} that becomes lodged in the pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer. Pulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide array}} of {{bacterial}} and viral diseases affect sheep. Diseases of the hoof, such as foot rot and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies. These painful conditions cause lameness and hinder feeding. Ovine Johne's disease is a wasting disease that affects young sheep. Bluetongue disease is an insect-borne illness causing fever and <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mucous membranes. Ovine rinderpest (or peste des petits ruminants) is a highly contagious and often fatal viral disease affecting sheep and goats.|$|E

5|$|Cocker Spaniels {{and other}} dogs that have long, {{pendulous}} ears are more predisposed to ear problems {{than some other}} breeds. The fold of the ear can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. Otitis externa is an <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ear canal which {{can be caused by}} a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E

People often experience red discoloration of the urine for a few days. Doxorubicin is in the anthracycline and antitumor antibiotic family of medications. It works in part by interfering with the function of DNA.|$|E
5|$|Crohn's {{disease is}} a type of {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. Signs and symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), fever, and weight loss. Other complications may occur outside the gastrointestinal tract and include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye, and tiredness. The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction also commonly occurs and those with the disease are at greater risk of bowel cancer.|$|E

5|$|During childhood, Goebbels {{suffered}} from ill health, {{which included a}} long bout of <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lungs. He had a deformed right foot that turned inwards, due to a congenital deformity. It was thicker and shorter than his left foot. He underwent a failed operation to correct it just prior to starting grammar school. Goebbels wore a metal brace and special shoe because of his shortened leg, and walked with a limp. He was rejected for military service in World War I due to his deformity.|$|E
5|$|Gastrointestinal {{disorders}} are sometimes associated with aphthous-like stomatitis, e.g. most commonly Celiac disease, but also {{inflammatory bowel disease}} such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The link between gastrointestinal disorders and aphthous stomatitis is probably related to nutritional deficiencies caused by malabsorption. Less than 5% of people with RAS have Celiac disease, which usually presents with severe malnutrition, anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea and glossitis (<b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongue). Sometimes aphthous-like ulcerations can be {{the only sign of}} celiac disease. Despite this association, a gluten-free diet does not usually improve the oral ulceration.|$|E
