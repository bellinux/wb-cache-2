50|$|Fowler said in February 2009 {{that his}} work toward revoking the Fairness Doctrine under the Reagan Administration had {{been a matter of}} {{principle}} (his belief that the Doctrine impinged upon the First Amendment), not partisanship. Fowler described the White House staff raising concerns, at a time before the prominence of conservative talk radio and during the preeminence of the Big Three television networks and PBS in political discourse, that repealing the policy would be politically unwise. He described the staff's position as saying to Reagan: Instead, Reagan supported the effort and later vetoed the Democratic-controlled Congress's effort to make the <b>doctrine</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "Castle Doctrine" [...] {{refers to}} the {{generally}} accepted common-law principle that one {{is not required to}} retreat when in one's own dwelling. Eliminating the requirement to retreat outside the home (i.e. in public) is generally referred to as a [...] "Stand Your Ground" [...] law. As of October 1, 2005, Florida became a [...] "No Duty to Retreat" [...] (i.e. Stand Your Ground) state. Florida Castle <b>Doctrine</b> <b>law</b> establishes that law-abiding residents and visitors may legally presume the threat of bodily harm or death from anyone who breaks into a residence or occupied vehicle and may use defensive force, including deadly force, against the intruder.With the passage of Florida's Stand Your Ground law, this principle now also applies in any other place where a person [...] "has a right to be." [...] Essentially, that person has [...] "no duty to retreat" [...] if attacked and may [...] "meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony". Note that all of the generally accepted common-law principles of self-defense must still be followed.|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} {{international}} law cannot be equalled to a mere pedigree of <b>doctrine.</b> <b>Law</b> lives in practice. In a constant dialogue between doctrine and practice, economics, history and philosophy, War, Trade and Neutrality shows what interdisciplinary scholarship on international law has to offer. Concrete cases allow to conceptualise state behaviour and establish a “common normative understanding ” proper to recurrent configurations of power. Moreover, the work of our Italian colleagues has been made more easily accessible through translation. This volume offers a stimulating contribution to international scholarship, analysing foreign policy from an actors’ perspective, based on primary archival and printed sources. Second, it brings a unique view of the legal translation of international relations from the minor powers’ side, sometimes at the centre of politics as an object, but more often active as laboratories {{on the fringes of}} European Big Power politics...|$|E

40|$|The {{juridical}} – historical – theoretical work {{covered in}} thesis is divided ideally into three parts. In the first it is analyzed {{the relevance of}} the concept of Will in positive law, in the living and the development of <b>doctrine</b> <b>law,</b> focusing in particular on a conceptual category that in recent decades has enjoyed a lot of luck within the orbit of the Law: the self-determination. Reviewing Applications some of that figure, it highlights the consonance with the Will. A Will That is usually identified as a subjective absolute power. A totipotent power through which the subject may engage in unlimited legal changes within the limits and with the observance of the obligations Established by the law. These will established concept, which assumes the value of a éndoxon, to quote Aristotle, is the primary object of the research: where does it come from, and the more or less unconscious, hermeneutical assumptions. The hypostatization of that concept has been found in the elaboration of the Franciscan and, mainly school, in the thinking of Peter John Olivi, a philosopher and theologian so little known, as much of profound speculation, at least for the present. This concept of will caused fracture {{in the history of the}} Legal thought (and not only in the legal thought). A fracture I decided to name "voluntarical Revolution". Then I analysed the William of Ockham’s speculation, and his relevance in the fracture mentioned above. The reverberations of the same have been then illustrated in the thought of John Locke, Who, is located perfectly within the channel drawn From His medieval precursors. ...|$|E
