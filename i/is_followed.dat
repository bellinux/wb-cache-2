5|$|The {{individual}} animals need {{to express}} survival-promoting behaviors, such as seeking food, water, shelter, and a mate. The motivational {{system in the}} brain monitors {{the current state of}} satisfaction of these goals, and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise. The motivational system works largely by a reward–punishment mechanism. When a particular behavior <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> by favorable consequences, the reward mechanism in the brain is activated, which induces structural changes inside the brain that cause the same behavior to be repeated later, whenever a similar situation arises. Conversely, when a behavior <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> by unfavorable consequences, the brain's punishment mechanism is activated, inducing structural changes that cause the behavior to be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future.|$|E
