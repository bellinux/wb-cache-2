5|$|Although he {{successfully}} prosecuted his {{operations in}} the war against Paraguay, Inhaúma's leadership was <b>encumbered</b> by his hesitating and procrastinating behavior. While in command in the war zone, he became mentally exhausted and contracted an unknown disease. Seriously ill, Inhaúma returned to the national capital in early 1869 and died shortly thereafter. Although historical works have not given much coverage to Inhaúma, some historians regard him among the greatest of the Brazilian navy officers.|$|E
5|$|Nupedia was <b>encumbered</b> by its peer-review system, a seven-step {{process of}} review and copyediting, and Wikipedia {{grew at a}} faster rate. In November 2000, Nupedia had 115 {{potential}} articles awaiting its peer-review process. By September 2001, after a total investment of US$250,000 from Bomis, Nupedia produced 12 articles; from 2000 through 2003, Nupedia contributors produced a total of 24 finalized articles. Wikipedia had about 20,000 articles and 18 language versions {{by the end of}} 2001.|$|E
5|$|The Pipil used wooden weapons {{with stone}} blades. Their weapons {{included}} long spears, atlatls (spear-throwers), arrows, and the macana (a wooden sword with inset obsidian blades {{similar to the}} Aztec macahuitl). These weapons proved inferior to elements of Spanish warfare such as steel, the horse and firearms. The Spanish described how the natives of El Salvador wore thick cotton armour, described as three fingers thick, that extended down {{to their feet and}} significantly <b>encumbered</b> them.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{centralized}} logistical system, the Polish armies were <b>encumbered</b> {{by large}} baggage trains. To some degree, this was turned into an advantage {{with the development of}} the tabor– military horse-drawn wagons, usually carrying army supplies. The wagon use for defensive formations was perfected by the Cossacks, and to a smaller extent used by other Commonwealth units. The Commonwealth army relied on cavalry, which the nobility saw as a much more respectable type of a troop than the infantry. Despite the reforms of the 17th century, it lost much of its military significance in the 18th century; the primary reason for this was a lack of sufficient funding.|$|E
5|$|From {{the moment}} of its {{founding}} the school was marred in controversy due to Senator Douglas's support of slavery and his authorship of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Early fundraising efforts were further hampered as Douglas {{came under heavy fire}} during the run-up to the 1860 presidential election for his ownership of 123 slaves and a 3000-acre cotton plantation in Lawrence County, Mississippi. In response, trustees further <b>encumbered</b> the land to fund the university's operations while funneling cash donations to a separate account for what is today the University of Chicago Divinity School (which temporarily moved to a separate campus in Morgan Park before rejoining the larger university in its current location in Hyde Park location in 1891).|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Wisconsin Heights {{had been}} {{a victory for the}} militia; no regular {{soldiers}} of the U.S. Army had been present. Atkinson and the regulars joined up with the volunteers several days after the battle. With a force of about 400 regulars and 900 militiamen, the Americans crossed the Wisconsin River on July 27 and resumed the pursuit of the British Band. The British Band was moving slow, <b>encumbered</b> with wounded warriors and people dying of starvation. The Americans followed the trail of dead bodies, cast off equipment, and the remains of horses the hungry Natives had eaten.|$|E

5|$|After {{his first}} {{marriage}} Ambrose Dudley remained childless. His second wife, Elizabeth Tailboys, suffered a phantom pregnancy in 1555. Anne Russell, though nearly 20 years her husband's junior, {{turned out to be}} a congenial partner. Through their paternal grandmother the Dudley brothers descended from the famous 15th century earls, John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. The Beauchamp descent especiallywhich was represented by the earldom of Warwickfilled them with pride. Ambrose's childlessness deeply concerned the widowed Robert Dudley, who for many years dared not to remarry for fear of the Queen's displeasure, and eventually died without direct heirs himself in September 1588. Most of Leicester's estateand debtspassed on to Warwick and <b>encumbered</b> his remaining lifetime. He also took care of his deceased brother's illegitimate teenage son Robert, who was his godson and whom Leicester had willed to inherit after Warwick's death.|$|E
5|$|While {{studying}} for his O-levels {{he began to}} have difficulties reading the blackboard and was initially devastated when told he would need glasses. At first, he played poorly at school, <b>encumbered</b> by the fragile spectacles. However, matters improved when a more robust pair, similar to those glasses worn by cricketer Roy Marshall, were fashioned {{for him at the}} behest of his maternal uncle, Albert Speight. Albert would go on to be a strong influence on Boycott's early cricketing game while playing for Brierley Juniors Football Club. In 1958, Boycott left school with seven O-level passes and the school's Individual Cricket Cup. That summer he played for the Leeds United under-18 football team alongside Billy Bremner and attracted the attention of Leeds United scouts. During the winter he continued to play nets with uncle Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|While {{the book}} was {{readable}} enough to sell, its dryness ensured that it was seen as aimed at specialist scientists {{and could not be}} dismissed as mere journalism or imaginative fiction. Unlike the still-popular Vestiges, it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation, though the closing sentence clearly hinted at cosmic progression. Darwin had long been immersed in the literary forms and practices of specialist science, and made effective use of his skills in structuring arguments. David Quammen has described the book as written in everyday language for a wide audience, but noted that Darwin's literary style was uneven: in some places he used convoluted sentences that are difficult to read, while in other places his writing was beautiful. Quammen advised that later editions were weakened by Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics, and recommended the first edition. James T. Costa said that because {{the book was}} an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace's essay, it was more approachable than the big book on natural selection Darwin had been working on, which would have been <b>encumbered</b> by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail. He added that some parts of Origin are dense, but other parts are almost lyrical, and the case studies and observations are presented in a narrative style unusual in serious scientific books, which broadened its audience.|$|E

These pages cannot be removed until the work enters the public domain after copyright expires.|$|E

The debts <b>encumbered</b> his estate, and his family sold 130 slaves, virtually all the members of every slave family, from Monticello to pay his creditors. Slave families who had been well established and stable for decades were sometimes split up. Most of the sold slaves either remained in Virginia or were relocated to Ohio.|$|E

25|$|In May 1880, Flipper and Nolan reunited {{during the}} Victorio Campaign. It {{was the last}} time the two met. Throughout this period, his {{military}} career was <b>encumbered</b> by racism in the military, though he did have the support of some officers, such as Nolan, and many of the white civilians he encountered who were impressed by his competency. In the later part of 1880, Flipper was transferred to Fort Davis in West Texas and assigned as the post quartermaster and commissary officer.|$|E
25|$|Through water {{communications}} systems are {{more suitable for}} scuba as the diver is not <b>encumbered</b> by a communications cable, but they can be fitted to surface supplied equipment if desired. Most through water systems have a Push To Talk (PTT) system, so that high power is only used to transmit the signal when the diver has something to say. For commercial diving applications this is a disadvantage, in that the supervisor can not monitor the condition of the divers by hearing them breathe.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes {{distinguished}} from manillas mainly by their wearability {{are a large}} number of regional types called 'Bracelet' monies and 'Legband' monies. Some are fairly uniform in size and weight and served as monies of account like manillas, but others were actually worn as wealth display. The less well off would mimic the movements of the 'better off' who were so <b>encumbered</b> by the weight of manillas that they moved in a very characteristic way. The larger manillas had a much more open shape.|$|E
25|$|In birds, males {{often have}} a more {{colourful}} appearance and may have features (like the long tail of male peacocks) {{that would seem to}} put the organism at a disadvantage (e.g. bright colors would seem to make a bird more visible to predators). One proposed explanation for this is the handicap principle. This hypothesis says that, by demonstrating he can survive with such handicaps, the male is advertising his genetic fitness to females—traits that will benefit daughters as well, who will not be <b>encumbered</b> with such handicaps.|$|E
25|$|In the Victorian era, despite {{contemporary}} {{ideas about}} morality, women's clothing was paradoxically designed to emphasize both the breasts and hips by tightlacing the waist. Victorian women were <b>encumbered</b> with {{many layers of}} clothing, including a chemise with a drawstring neckline, usually drawers, then the corset and corset cover, the under petticoat, the hoop skirt, the over petticoat, and finally the dress. According to the social expectations of the times, even the lowest-cut evening gown should dip no lower than three finger breadths below the clavicles.|$|E
