50|$|Some {{of these}} agents {{are used as}} analgesics, {{including}} pentazocine, phenazocine, dezocine, and <b>eptazocine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Eptazocine</b> (Sedapain) is an opioid {{analgesic}} which {{was introduced in}} Japan by Morishita in 1987. It acts as a mixed κ-opioid receptor agonist and μ-opioid receptor antagonist.|$|E
50|$|Similarly to μ-opioid {{receptor}} (MOR) agonists, KOR agonists are potently analgesic, {{and have}} been employed clinically {{in the treatment of}} pain. However, KOR agonists also produce side effects such as dysphoria, hallucinations, and dissociation, which has limited their clinical usefulness. Examples of KOR agonists that have been used medically as analgesics include butorphanol, nalbuphine, levorphanol, levallorphan, pentazocine, phenazocine, and <b>eptazocine.</b> Difelikefalin (CR845, FE-202845) and CR665 (FE-200665, JNJ-38488502) are peripherally restricted KOR agonists lacking the CNS side effects of centrally active KOR agonists and are currently under clinical investigation as analgesics.|$|E
50|$|Buprenorphine and {{dezocine}} are partial agonists of the MOR but antagonists of the KOR. Contrarily, <b>eptazocine</b> is an antagonist of the MOR but an agonist of the KOR; {{the same}} is also true for nalorphine and levallorphan. A variety of partial agonists or mixed agonists-antagonists of the MOR and KOR are also marketed, and include butorphanol, levorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, and phenazocine. All of the aforementioned drugs may be described as opioid modulators instead of as pure antagonists. With the sole exception of nalorphine, all of the preceding are used as analgesics (by virtue {{of the fact that}} both MOR and KOR agonism independently confer pain relief). However, these opioid analgesics have atypical properties in comparison to the prototypical pure MOR full agonist opioid analgesics, such as less or no risk of respiratory depression for MOR partial agonists and antagonists, reduced or no euphoria, abuse potential, and dependence liability with MOR partial agonists/antagonists, and use- and dose-limiting side effects such as dysphoria and hallucinations with KOR agonists. In addition, by virtue of its KOR antagonism, buprenorphine (as buprenorphine/samidorphan (ALKS-5461) or buprenorphine/naltrexone to block its MOR agonism) is under investigation for the treatment of depression and cocaine dependence, as are other KOR antagonists such as CERC-501 (LY-2456302) and, previously, JDTic and PF-4455242 (both discontinued due to toxicity concerns).|$|E
40|$|Aphanorphine is an {{alkaloid}} {{isolated from}} the fresh water algae Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. The 3 -benzazepine scaffold in aphanorphine resembles the benzomorphan analgesics such as pentazocine, <b>eptazocine</b> and morphine. The complex 3 -benzazepine scaffold and a quaternary stereocenter has made (−) -aphanorphine an interesting synthetic target. The synthesis of (−) -aphanorphine from an enantiomerically enriched α-hydroxy acid derivative is described in Chapter 1 of this thesis. This hydroxy acid is readily available from an ephedrine-derived morpholinone via a highly diastereoselective allylation followed by removal of the ephedrine portion. The methodology developed for the synthesis of (−) -aphanorphine is potentially useful for the synthesis of other N-methylpyrrolidine-based natural products and related structural motifs. Clauslactone S is a terpenoid which was extracted from the leaves and stems of Clausena excavate in 2008. There has been no synthesis of clauslactone S reported to date. We envisaged that the substituted δ-lactone in clauslactone S can be synthesized using an enantiomerically enriched α-hydroxy acid derivative. Studies {{on the development of}} a modular synthetic strategy for clauslactone S and the details of the synthesis of a potential intermediate to clauslactone S are described in Chapter 2 of the thesis. The α-hydroxy acid derivative employed as starting material in the aphanorphine and clauslctone S studies is readily obtained by a highly diastereoselective double alkylation of an ephedrine-derived morpholinedione. However, the limitation of the methodology is that ephedrine is no longer commercially available. Hence, studies were conducted on several morpholinediones, that were derived from enantiomerically enriched amino alcohols, with the objective of finding an alternative to ephedrine. Details of these investigations are presented in Chapter 3 of this thesis...|$|E
