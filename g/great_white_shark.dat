5|$|Megalodon is now {{considered}} {{to be a member of}} the family Otodontidae, genus Carcharocles, as opposed to it previous classification into Lamnidae, genus Carcharodon. Megalodon's classification into Carcharodon was due to dental similarity with the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark,</b> but most authors currently believe that this is due to convergent evolution. In this model, the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> is more closely related to the shark Isurus hastalis than to megalodon, as evidenced by more similar dentition in those two sharks; megalodon teeth have much finer serrations than <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> teeth. The <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> is more closely related to the mako shark (Isurus spp.), with a common ancestor around 4 mya. However, proponents of the former model, wherein megalodon and the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> are more closely related, argue that the differences between their dentition are minute and obscure.|$|E
5|$|Sharks often employ complex hunting {{strategies}} to engage large prey animals. <b>Great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> hunting strategies may {{be similar to}} how megalodon hunted its large prey. However, megalodon bite marks on whale fossils suggests that it employed different hunting strategies against large prey than the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> has {{no known}} natural predators other than, on very rare occasion, the killer whale. The <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> {{is arguably the}} world's largest known extant macropredatory fish, {{and is one of}} the primary predators of marine mammals. It is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals, {{including}} fish and seabirds. It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon, and is ranked first in having the most recorded shark bite incidents on humans. The IUCN list the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> as a vulnerable species, while it is included in AppendixII of CITES.|$|E

5|$|The {{narrative}} of Abzû is told wordlessly through gameplay and using cutscenes, {{taking place in}} a vast ocean. The player character, {{referred to as a}} female diver, awakens floating in the ocean and begins exploring the surrounding sea: ruins and ancient murals show that an ancient civilization which shared a symbiotic connection with the ocean. As she explores, she is led by a <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> to wells that—when activated using an energy from within her—restore life to the local seas. That energy is being forcefully harvested by pyramid-like devices, the development of which disrupted the ocean's balance and brought about the civilization's downfall. Upon reaching the original pyramid, the diver sees the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> attacking it, and the pyramid's counterattack damages the diver—revealing her to be mechanical and confirming her existence as a being connected to the pyramid and capable of restoring life to the ocean—and mortally wounds the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark,</b> which dies as the diver comforts it. After activating the final well, the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> manifests and guides the repaired diver back to the pyramid. The diver destroys the pyramid, causing life to return to the ocean. During the credits, the diver and <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> swim together through the revitalized ocean.|$|E
5|$|Generally sharks {{have only}} one layer of tesserae, but the jaws of large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark,</b> have two to three layers or more, {{depending}} on body size. The jaws of a large <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> may have up to five layers. In the rostrum (snout), the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} {{how much of a}} {{concurrent}} increase in fishing for great white sharks has caused the decline of <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> populations from the 1970s to the present. No accurate global population numbers are available, but the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> is now considered vulnerable. Sharks taken during the long interval between birth and sexual maturity never reproduce, making population recovery and growth difficult.|$|E

5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that other notable species of sharks, such as the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark,</b> responded to competitive pressure from megalodon by avoiding regions it inhabited by mainly inhabiting the cooler waters of the time. In areas where their ranges seemed to overlap, such as in Pliocene Baja California, {{it is possible that}} megalodon and the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> occupied the area at different times of the year while following different migratory prey. Megalodon probably also had a tendency for cannibalism, much like contemporary sharks.|$|E

5|$|The genus Carcharocles {{currently}} contains four species: C. auriculatus, C. angustidens, C. chubutensis, and C. megalodon. The genus {{was proposed}} by D. S. Jordan and H. Hannibal in 1923 to contain C. auriculatus. In the 1980s, megalodon {{was assigned to}} Carcharocles. Before this, in 1960, the genus Procarcharodon was erected by French ichthyologist Edgard Casier, which included those four sharks and was considered separate from the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark.</b> It is now considered a junior synonym of Carcharocles. The genus Palaeocarcharodon was erected alongside Procarcharodon to represent {{the beginning of the}} lineage, and, in the model wherein megalodon and the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> are closely related, their last common ancestor. However, it is believed to be an evolutionary dead-end and unrelated to the Carcharocles sharks by authors who reject that model.|$|E
