[...] In 1955 he proposed a similar system to Laplace, and with more mathematical detail in 1960. It differs from Laplace in that a magnetic torque occurs between the disk and the Sun, which comes into effect immediately or else more and more matter would be ejected resulting in a much too massive planetary system, one comparable to the Sun. The torque causes a magnetic coupling and acts to transfer angular momentum from the Sun to the disk. The magnetic field strength {{would have to be}} 1 gauss. The existence of torque depends on magnetic lines of force being frozen into the disk (a consequence of a well-known MHD (magnetohydrodynamic) theorem on frozen-in lines of force). As the solar condensation temperature when the disk was ejected could not be much more than 1000 degrees K., a number of refractories must be solid, probably as fine smoke particles, which would grow with condensation and accretion. These particles would be swept out with the disk only if their diameter at the Earth's orbit was less than 1 meter so as the disk moved outward a subsidiary disk consisting of only refractories remains behind where the terrestrial planets would form. The model is in good agreement with the mass and composition of the planets and angular momentum distribution provided the magnetic coupling is an acceptable idea, but not explained are twinning, the low mass of Mars and Mercury, and the planetoid belts.

The classical MHD concept of ideally <b>frozen-in</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> is only strictly valid, if the magnetized medium is fully ionized. As is well known, however, the heliospheric medium represents a partially ionized plasma which contains neutral H-atom flows interacting with the ions via resonant charge exchange processes.

The dynamics of the distant multi-constituent solar wind is, however, not solely determined by these loading processes, but is also affected by the wave-mediated pick-up ion pressure gradients derivable from the pick-up ion distribution function. The action of the radial components of these pressures essentially counter balances the decelerating effect of the solar wind momentum loading, diminishing strongly the deceleration of the distant solar wind. Furthermore the latitudinal components of the pick-up ion pressures induce latitudinal forces acting on the multiconstituent solar plasma outflow and inducing nonradial bulk flow components.

An obvious test is to compare the perpendicular electric field with the plasma drift, i. e. to test if E =– v × B. Yet another aspect is to rule out the existence of parallel (to B) electric fields. These two tests have been subject to extensive research for decades. However, the ultimate test of the "frozen-in" condition, based on measurement data, is yet to be identified. We combine Cluster CIS-data and FGM-data, estimating the change in magnetic flux (d B /dt) and the curl of plasma – v × B (? ×(v × B)), the terms in the "frozen-in equation". Our test suggests that ideal MHD applies in a macroscopic sense in major parts of the outer magnetosphere, for instance, in the external cusp and in the high-latitude magnetosheath.

We resolve the formation of a star/disk/envelope system and extend our numerical simulations to the late accretion phase when the envelope is nearly totally depleted of matter. We adopted a classification scheme of Andre et al. and calculate the lifetimes of the Class 0 and Class I phases (τ_C 0 and τ_CI, respectively) based on the mass remaining in the envelope. When cloud cores with various rotation rates, masses, and sizes (but identical otherwise) are considered, our modeling reveals a sub-linear correlation between the Class 0 lifetimes and stellar masses in the Class 0 phase with the least-squares fit exponent m= 0. 8 ± 0. 05. The corresponding correlation between the Class I lifetimes and stellar masses in the Class I is super-linear with m= 1. 2 ± 0. 05.

40|$|The intracluster medium (ICM) {{has been}} {{suggested}} to be buoyantly unstable {{in the presence of}} magnetic field and anisotropic thermal conduction. We perform first cosmological simulations of galaxy cluster formation that simultaneously include magnetic fields, radiative cooling, and anisotropic thermal conduction. In isolated and idealized cluster models, the magnetothermal instability (MTI) tends to reorient the magnetic fields radially whenever the temperature gradient points in the direction opposite to gravitational acceleration. Using cosmological simulations of cluster formation we detect radial bias in the velocity and magnetic fields. Such radial bias is consistent with either the inhomogeneous radial gas flows due to substructures or residual MTI-driven field rearrangements that are expected even in the presence of turbulence. Although disentangling the two scenarios is challenging, we do not detect excess bias in the runs that include anisotropic thermal conduction. The anisotropy effect is potentially detectable via radio polarization measurements with LOFAR and the Square Kilometer Array and future X-ray spectroscopic studies with the International X-ray Observatory. We demonstrate that radiative cooling boosts the amplification of the magnetic field by about two orders of magnitude beyond what is expected in the non-radiative cases. This effect is caused by the compression of the gas and <b>frozen-in</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> as it accumulates in the cluster center. At z = 0 the field is amplified by a factor of about 10 6 compared to the uniform magnetic field that evolved due to the universal expansion alone. Interestingly, the runs that include both radiative cooling and thermal conduction exhibit stronger magnetic field amplification than purely radiative runs. In these cases, buoyant restoring forces depend on the temperature gradients rather than the steeper entropy gradients. Thus, the ICM is more easily mixed and the winding up of the <b>frozen-in</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is more efficient, resulting in stronger magnetic field amplification.

While the O-atoms pass over this shock with no velocity-space imprints, by contrast the O + -ions run over the shock structure with a typical overshoot velocity and on the downstream region are then picked up by the <b>frozen-in</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> that comove with the plasma bulk flow, i. e. the proton bulk flow. This leads to a strongly non-relaxated O-ion velocity distribution which substantially differs both from the local O-atom and proton distribution functions. Due to a strong charge exchange coupling between O-ions/atoms and H-atoms/ions the distributions downstream from the bowshock undergo permanent changes which we estimate in this study here. Even though relaxation processes operate by Coulomb collisions, wave-particle interactions and elastic atom-atom collisions, the bowshock imprints on the O- ion and atoms distribution functions may be conserved throughout the whole heliospheric interface, and, as we are going to suggest in this paper, in fact as such may be used as tracers to the physics {{and the nature of the}} bowshock. One of the main conclusions is that the population of O-atoms created in the vicinity of the bow-shock should carry a signature of the effective shock strength that could be detectable if the LIC <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is about 2 microgauss or stronger...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the combined effect of solar wind, Poynting-Robertson drag, and the <b>frozen-in</b> interplanetary <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> on {{the motion of}} charged dust grains in our solar system. For this reason we derive a secular theory of motion by the means of averaging method and validate it with numerical simulations of the un-averaged equations of motions. The theory predicts that the secular motion of charged particles is mainly affected by the z-component of the solar magnetic axis, or the normal component of the interplanetary <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> The normal component of the interplanetary <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> leads to an increase or decrease of semi-major axis depending on its functional form and sign of charge of the dust grain. It is generally accepted that the combined effects of solar wind and photon absorption and re-emmision (Poynting-Robertson drag) lead to a decrease in semi-major axis on secular time scales. On the contrary, we demonstrate that the interplanetary <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> may counteract these drag forces under certain circumstances. We derive a simple relation between {{the parameters of the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> the physical properties of the dust grain as well as the shape and orientation of the orbital ellipse of the particle, which is a necessary conditions for the stabilization in semi-major axis.

40|$|We {{investigate}} self-similar magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) {{processes in}} an isothermal self-gravitating fluid with a quasi-spherical symmetry {{and extend the}} envelope expansion with core collapse (EECC) solutions of Lou & Shen by incorporating a random <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> Stagnation surfaces of EECC solutions that seperate core collapse and envelope expansion propagate at constant speeds either sub-magnetosonically or super-magnetosonically. Crossing the magnetosonic line twice analytically, there exists {{an infinite number of}} discrete magnetized EECC and ECCC solutions. In addition to the EECC shock solution which could change the central accretion rate, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> can also affect the core accretion rate. As the magnetic parameter λ increases, the core accretion rate appropriate for the MHD EWCS becomes larger. Under the <b>frozen-in</b> approximation, <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in the envelope expansion portion would scale as B∝ r^- 1, while in the core collapse portion they would scale as B∝ r^- 1 / 2. We discuss several astrophysical applications of EECC similarity solutions to the formation process of proto-planetary nebulae connecting the AGB phase and the planetary nebula, to supernova remnants, collapse of magnetized molecular cloud, to H II clouds surrounding massive OB stars and to a certain evolution phase of galaxy clusters.
