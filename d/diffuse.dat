5|$|A few {{hydroxyl}} megamasers, including Arp 220, {{have been}} observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), which allows sources to be studied at higher angular resolution. VLBI observations indicate that hydroxyl megamaser emission is composed of two components, one <b>diffuse</b> and one compact. The <b>diffuse</b> component displays gains of less than a factor of one and linewidths of order hundreds of kilometers per second. These characteristics {{are similar to those}} seen with single dish observations of hydroxyl megamasers that are unable to resolve individual masing components. The compact components have high gains, ranging from tens to hundreds,high ratios of flux at 1667MHz to flux at 1665MHz, and linewidths are of order a few kilometers per second. These general features have been explained by a narrow circumnuclear ring of material from which the <b>diffuse</b> emission arises, and individual masing clouds with sizes of order one parsec that give rise to the compact emission. The hydroxyl masers observed in the Milky Way more closely resemble the compact hydroxyl megamaser components. There are, however, some regions of extended galactic maser emission from other molecules that resemble the <b>diffuse</b> component of hydroxyl megamasers.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether <b>diffusing</b> capacity influences operative mortality and long-term survival after resection for lung cancer. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the case histories of patients who underwent major resection for lung cancer. The association between operative mortality and predicted postoperative <b>diffusing</b> capacity was examined. Long-term survival among operative survivors was compared between the groups with high and low predicted postoperative <b>diffusing</b> capacity. Results: The group comprised 410 patients {{with a mean age}} of 62. 3 years. We performed 273 lobectomies, 35 bilobectomies, and 102 pneumonectomies. A total of 32 operative deaths (7. 8 %) were associated with low predicted postoperative <b>diffusing</b> capacity (P. 5 for each). On the basis of the Cox proportional hazards model, predicted postoperative <b>diffusing</b> capacity did not have a statistically significant effect on long-term survival (estimated hazard ratio corresponding to a 20 -point decrease in predicted postoperative <b>diffusing</b> capacity = 1. 13; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 92 to 1. 37). Conclusion: A poor <b>diffusing</b> capacity is associated with high operative mortality but does not adversely affect long-term survival after major lung resection among operative survivors. Improving the perioperative management of patients undergoing major lung resection may enable inclusion of more patients with reduced <b>diffusing</b> capacity in the candidate pool for surgery, thus maximizing survival for early-stage lung cancer.

The violent shaking of an infant that causes shaken baby syndrome commonly manifests as <b>diffuse</b> injury.

The {{purposes of this study}} were (1) to determine the best predictors of morbidity and mortality and (2) to assess whether interactions exist between <b>diffusing</b> capacity and spirometry that help estimate outcome after major lung resection. Design: A retrospective analysis of 376 patients who underwent lung resection was performed. Three hundred three had lung cancer and 73 had other disease. Two hundred eighty-four underwent lobectomy/bilobectomy and 92 had pneumonectomy. We assessed the relationship of 23 preoperative variables to 18 postoperative events classified into categories as pulmonary or cardiac complications, overall morbidity, and operative mortality. Results:The best single predictor of complications was the percent predicted postoperative <b>diffusing</b> capacity. The incidences of pulmonary and cardiac complications, morbidity, and mortality were inversely related to predicted postoperative <b>diffusing</b> capacity percent (p < 0. 004 for each). Multivariate logistic regression analyses identified only predicted postoperative <b>diffusing</b> capacity percent and age as significant independent predictors of pulmonary complications, morbidity, and death, and these with prior myocardial infarction predicted cardiac complications. There were no interactions between percent predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second and predicted postoperative <b>diffusing</b> capacity percent in estimating risks of complications. Conclusion: Predicted postoperative <b>diffusing</b> capacity percent is the strongest single predictor of risk of complications and mortality after lung resection. There is little interrelationship of predicted postoperative <b>diffusing</b> capacity percent and predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second, indicating that these values should be assessed independently in estimating operative risk.
