25|$|Mary, {{the wife}} of Clopas, is named only once in the New Testament, in , where she is listed as one of four women {{standing}} by the Cross, the others being Mary the mother of Jesus, her sister (or perhaps cousin, the Aramaic words being the same), and Mary Magdalene. An alternative reading is that the list is of only three women, and that Mary of Clopas is also the sister (or cousin) of Mary the mother of <b>Jesus,</b> <b>as</b> <b>some</b> traditions maintain. The passage could also be interpreted to mean that Mary of Clopas is Clopas' daughter, rather than his wife, {{but this is not}} the general view.|$|R
50|$|According to Kähler, {{the quest}} for the {{historical}} Jesus ("The Life-of-Jesus research") is challenged by there existing no historical biographies of the life of Jesus. The gospels serve as our only sources, and they are limited in scope, leaving many unanswered questions. One must resist the urge to speculate too much about the life of <b>Jesus,</b> <b>as</b> <b>some</b> historical analogies and psychoanalyses do. He concludes that we do not need to know all the details about Jesus' life. All we really need to know is that Jesus died for the sins of the world. It is through him that we are redeemed. Preoccupation with tenuous details about Jesus' life distracts from that which really matters about Jesus - his redeeming death and his subsequent resurrection.|$|R
25|$|In the Pauline view, Adam is {{positioned}} as the <b>first</b> man and <b>Jesus</b> <b>as</b> the second: Adam, having corrupted himself by his disobedience, also infected humanity {{and left it}} with a curse as its inheritance.

Actor Tom Payne promised “he is the same as he is the comic books in that regard,” and later said, “I was excited to <b>first</b> establish <b>Jesus</b> <b>as</b> a kick-ass ninja, then have the fact that he happens to be gay dropped in later. The way it’s done is subtle. It’s a small moment.” ...|$|R
50|$|In the Pauline view, Adam is {{positioned}} as the <b>first</b> man and <b>Jesus</b> <b>as</b> {{the second and}} last Adam (1 Corinthians 15:45), the first having corrupted himself by his disobedience, also infected humanity and left it with a curse as inheritance. The birth of Jesus, on the other hand, counterbalanced the fall of Adam, bringing forth redemption and repairing {{the damage done by}} Adam.|$|R

5000|$|Both names, [...] "Aenon" [...] and [...] "Salim", are not unique, and the Gospel text offers {{only two}} {{additional}} hints about where Aenon might be located: {{the most direct}} information is that [...] "there was plenty of water there" [...] (...) , {{and the second is}} that it was west of the River Jordan because at Aenon John's disciples talk of the site where John <b>first</b> encountered <b>Jesus</b> <b>as</b> being [...] "on {{the other side of the}} Jordan" [...] (...) , which is taken to mean east of the river. We also know from [...] that that first encounter happened at [...] "Bethany on the other side of the Jordan".|$|R

The Synod of Victoria and Tasmania voted to request St Michael's Uniting Church to remove advertising for its new faith and apologise to Jews, Christians and Muslims for the comments it contained about the Ten Commandments. The Uniting Church did not move to discipline Macnab because no formal complaint had been received.|$|R

2500|$|In {{his later}} work, Morton Smith {{increasingly}} {{came to see}} the historical <b>Jesus</b> <b>as</b> practicing <b>some</b> type of magical rituals and hypnotism, thus explaining various healings of demoniacs in the gospels. Smith seems to have developed his libertine understanding of Jesus starting from about 1967. He carefully explored for any traces of a [...] "libertine tradition" [...] in early Christianity, and in the New Testament. Yet there's very little in the Mar Saba MS to give backing to any of this. This is illustrated by the fact that Smith devoted only 12 lines to Mar Saba MS in his book Jesus the Magician.|$|R
25|$|The Synoptic Gospels list Philip {{as one of}} the apostles. The Gospel of John recounts Philip's calling as {{a disciple}} of Jesus. Philip is {{described}} as a disciple from the city of Bethsaida, and the evangelist connects him with Andrew and Peter, who were from the same town. He also was among those surrounding John the Baptist when the latter <b>first</b> pointed out <b>Jesus</b> <b>as</b> the Lamb of God. It was Philip who first introduced Nathanael (sometimes identified with Bartholomew) to Jesus. According to Butler, Philip was among those attending the wedding at Cana.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent decades}} {{there has been}} an intensively renewed {{interest}} in the origins and development of ‘christology’, or, to use a broader term intended to take into account religious practices as well as ideas/beliefs, earliest ‘devotion’ to Jesus. In general, this newer work has emphasized the early period and Jewish religious setting in which this remarkable devotion to <b>Jesus</b> <b>first</b> emerged (e. g., Newman, Davila, Lewis 1999), and scholars have thus explored in what ways Jesus-devotion may have drawn upon Jewish tradition and how it may have represented something innovative. In particular, there are questions about the means by which early believers shaped by Jewish tradition with its concern for the uniqueness of God may have accommodated devotion to <b>Jesus</b> <b>as</b> in <b>some</b> way bearing divine significance. The Qumran texts comprise a major and unique cache of material giving us access to second-temple Jewish religious tradition, and are, thus, integral in all of this investigation (e. g., Segal 1992) ...|$|R
25|$|There {{are some}} {{movements}} that combine elements of Judaism {{with those of}} other religions. The most well-known of these is Messianic Judaism, a religious movement, which arose in the 1960s, that incorporates elements of Judaism with the tenets of Christianity. The movement generally states that Jesus is the Jewish Messiah, that {{he is one of the}} Three Divine Persons, and that salvation is only achieved through acceptance of <b>Jesus</b> <b>as</b> one's savior. <b>Some</b> members of the movement argue that Messianic Judaism is a sect of Judaism. Jewish organizations of every denomination reject this, stating that Messianic Judaism is a Christian sect, because it teaches creeds which are identical to those of Pauline Christianity.|$|R

40|$|Beyond objectivism and relativism: Towards new {{foundations}} for historical Jesus studies In {{light of the}} contemporary epistemological discussion with regard to historical Jesus-studies and historiography in general, recent scholarship proposes that historical criticism and creativity should be combined to form a contemporary relevant picture of <b>Jesus</b> <b>as</b> historical figure. <b>Some</b> philosophical insights produced during the last century also suggest that western civilisation has become preoccupied with the essence of things and has forgotten that people are essentially ethical beings in need of wisdom.

In this article these issues are elaborated upon in discussion with especially Heidegger, Bernstein and Gadamer. Eventually the insights gained by this discussion are illustrated with regard to historical Jesus studies. </p...|$|R
500|$|Due to her {{borrowing}} from Virgil, Proba's Christ {{is very similar}} to the Virgilian epic hero. Parallels between the two include both seeking a goal greater than their own happiness, initiating realms [...] "without end", and projecting auras of divinity. According to Elizabeth A. Clark (a specialist in early Christianity) and Diane Hatch (a classicist), Proba's purpose was to [...] "imbue the Christ with heroic virtues" [...] akin to the Virgilian hero. The poet does this in three major ways: <b>First,</b> she describes <b>Jesus</b> <b>as</b> remarkably beautiful, with [...] "a magnificent and commanding presence" [...] similar to that of Aeneas. Second, Proba recasts the crucifixion; Jesus does not go meekly to his death, but lashes out at his persecutors. Her reconfiguration of Jesus's crucifixion is in line with Aeneas' [...] "vengeful action" [...] against Turnus at the end of book twelve of the Aeneid. Finally, Proba transfers to Jesus portions of prophecies scattered through the Aeneid detailing Rome's [...] future via the progeny of Aeneas (thus recasting the oracular episodes in a Christian light).|$|R
50|$|The present {{church is}} the second {{building}} {{to stand on the}} site, the first being built in the 12th century by Mr Hervey. However, nothing survives of the Norman church and the oldest part of the existing building is the decorated chancel (c. 1290). There was a major renovation between the 14th and 16th centuries and it is at this point that the nave, its aisles and the tower were built. It is also at this time that Mary Tudor, favourite sister of Henry VIII, died and was buried in the church. Her tomb is in the sanctuary directly {{to the north of the}} Lord's table. The church, however, is dedicated to Mary, the mother of <b>Jesus,</b> and not, <b>as</b> <b>some</b> mistakenly believe, to Mary Tudor.|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of Mt 8 - 9 is very complex, {{and there is}} no unanimous understanding. If we use Matthew 2 ̆ 7 s Three Stage Progression (MTSP), a writing technique that is found frequently in the gospel of Matthew, we can theologicaly explain the intention of Mt 8 - 9 more clearly than any other existing explanations. Matthew arranged the nine miracle stories progressively in three clusters (8 : 1 - 17; 8 : 23 - 9 : 8; 9 : 18 - 34). Those three clusters are divided by two intervening pericopae (8 : 18 - 22; 9 : 9 - 17). The <b>first</b> cluster describes <b>Jesus</b> <b>as</b> the merciful healing Messiah. Jesus heals every disease he encounters. In the second cluster, Jesus is the divine being who commands the nature and the demons. He even has the authority of forgiving sins. The third cluster closed the miracle narratives by emphasizing the spread of Jesus 2 ̆ 7 news. Here we can conclude that Matthew 8 - 9 focuses on Christology, using the literary method of revealing Jesus 2 ̆ 7 identity progressivly in three units...|$|R
