40|$|The {{need for}} {{generating}} precisely designed mutations {{is common in}} genetics, biochemistry, and molecular biology. Here, I describe a new λ Red recombineering method (Direct and Inverted Repeat stimulated excision; DIRex) for fast and easy generation of single point mutations, small insertions or replacements as well as deletions of any size, in bacterial genes. The method does not leave any resistance marker or scar sequence and requires only one transformation to generate a semi-stable intermediate insertion mutant. Spontaneous excision of the intermediate efficiently and accurately generates the final mutant. In addition, the intermediate is transferable between strains by <b>generalized</b> <b>transductions,</b> enabling transfer of the mutation into multiple strains without repeating the recombineering step. Existing methods {{that can be used}} to accomplish similar results are either (i) more complicated to design, (ii) more limited in what mutation types can be made, or (iii) require expression of extrinsic factors in addition to λ Red. I demonstrate the utility of the method by generating several deletions, small insertions/replacements, and single nucleotide exchanges in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Furthermore, the design parameters that influence the excision frequency and the success rate of generating desired point mutations have been examined to determine design guidelines for optimal efficiency...|$|R
40|$|In {{the absence}} of host RecA function, plasmid {{transduction}} by bacteriophage P 22 can be mediated by Erf recombinase. Erf is not carried on the infecting particle but synthesized upon infection. In the recipient cell, Erf can promote both <b>generalized</b> plasmid <b>transduction</b> (which requires the circularization of plasmids transduced as linear multimers) and specialized plasmid transduction (which requires the release of plasmid DNA from linear plasmid-phage cointegrates). Both processes of Erf-mediated plasmid transduction require host RecBCD function. In contrast, RecBCD is not required for Erf-mediated circularization of P 22 DNA...|$|R

50|$|If bacteriophages {{undertake}} the lytic cycle of infection upon entering a bacterium, the virus will {{take control of}} the cell’s machinery for use in replicating its own viral DNA. If by chance bacterial chromosomal DNA is inserted into the viral capsid which is usually used to encapsulate the viral DNA, the mistake will lead to <b>generalized</b> <b>transduction.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Generalized</b> <b>transduction</b> is {{the process}} by which any {{bacterial}} gene may be transferred to another bacterium via a bacteriophage, and very rarely a small number of phages carry the donor(bacterial genome)genome,(1 phage in 10.000 ones carry the donor genome). In essence, this is the packaging of bacterial DNA into a viral envelope. This may occur in two main ways, recombination and headful packaging.|$|E
50|$|T even bacteriophages {{are genetically}} related. The genetic {{diversity}} of bacteriophage is extraordinary and phenomenal. The genetic {{elements of a}} bacteriophage is transferred from one bacterium to another {{through the process of}} transduction. The process of transduction can be specialized or generalized. The <b>generalized</b> <b>transduction</b> is found within the lytic cycle where units of the bacterial DNA are packaged in a phage capsid. Therefore, when these type of phages infect other bacterial cells, the bacterial DNA is inserted inside. Previously mentioned, bacterial genes can be transferred in <b>generalized</b> <b>transduction.</b> Whereas, in specialized transduction, only the genes that are adjacent to the prophage are transferred. Bacteriophage genomes can be highly mosaic at which the phage is made up of individual modules which may be found in other phage species in different arrangements. Based on correlative sequence similarity regulatory patterns, genomic organization, and virion structureof their essential genes, other phages from various parts of the world belong to this family.|$|E
40|$|The {{temperate}} bacteriophage P 22 mediates both <b>generalized</b> {{and specialized}} <b>transduction</b> in Salmonella typhimurium. Specialized transduction by phage P 22 is different from, and less restricted than, the well characterized specialized transduction by phage lambda, due {{to differences in}} the phage DNA packaging mechanisms. Based on the properties of the DNA packaging mechanism of phage P 22 a model for the generation of various types of specialized transducing particles is presented that suggests generation of substantial numbers of specialized transducing genomes which are heterogeneous but only some of which have terminally redundant ends. The primary attachment site, ataA, for phage P 22 in S. typhimurium is located between the genes proA,B and supQ newD. (The newD gene is a substitute gene for the leuD gene, restoring leucine prototrophy of leuD mutant strains.) The proA,B and supQ newD genes are very closely linked and thus cotransducible by generalized transducing particles. Specialized transducing particles can carry either proA,B or supQ newD but not both simultaneously, and thus cannot give rise to cotransduction of the proA,B and supQ newD genes. This difference is used to calculate the frequency of generalized and specialized transducing particles from the observed cotransduction frequency in phage lysates. By this method, very high frequencies of supQ newD (10 (- 2) /PFU) - and proA,B (10 (- 3) /PFU) -specialized transducing particles were detected in lysates produced by induction of lysogenic strains. These transducing particles most of which would have been produced by independent aberrant excision events (which include in situ packaging), were of various types...|$|R
40|$|The {{temperate}} bacteriophage P 22 mediates both <b>generalized</b> {{and specialized}} <b>transduction</b> in Salmonella typhimurium. Specialized transduction by phage P 22 is different from, and less restricted than, the well characterized specialized transduction by phage lambda, due {{to differences in}} the phage DNA packaging mechanism. Phage lysates produced by induction of lysogenic strains contain very high frequencies of supQ newD- and proA,B-specialized transducing particles (10 (- 2) /PFU and 10 (- 3) /PFU, respectively), most of which are produced by independent aberrant excision events of various types. In a model, 12 different modes of transduction mechanisms were characterized by: (i) the structure of the specialized transducing genomes after injection into a new host cell, i. e., linear or circular, and (ii) the requirements for the transduction process, i. e., host recombination functions, phage integration functions, or presence of a prophage. By using different recipient strains and phage helper strains, it was possible to show that most specialized transducing particles (ca. 99 %) contain linear genomes that cannot circularize upon injection into a new host cell and that require the presence of an integrated prophage as a site for a recombinational event to give rise to a transductant. Only 0. 1 % of all specialized transducing particles were shown to transduce by integration, suggesting that transducing genomes containing terminally redundant ends represent only a minor fraction of all transducing particles that are produced. However, {{it should be pointed out}} that the frequency (approximately 10 (- 5) /PFU) of these specialized transducing genomes that can circularize upon injection into a new host cell is as high as or even higher than the frequency of specialized transducing particles of phage lambda. The remaining approximately 1 % of all specialized transducing particles can transduce by any one of the other mechanisms described...|$|R
5000|$|New genes may be {{introduced}} into bacteria by a bacteriophage that has replicated within a donor through <b>generalized</b> <b>transduction</b> or specialized transduction. The amount of DNA {{that can be}} transmitted in one event is constrained {{by the size of}} the phage capsid (although the upper limit is about 100 kilobases). While phages are numerous in the environment, the range of microorganisms that can be transduced depends on receptor recognition by the bacteriophage. Transduction does not require both donor and recipient cells to be present simultaneously in time nor space. Phage-encoded proteins both mediate the transfer of DNA into the recipient cytoplasm and assist integration of DNA into the chromosome.|$|E
50|$|R-M {{systems are}} {{major players in}} the co-evolutionary {{interaction}} between mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and their hosts. Genes encoding R-M systems have been reported to move between prokaryotic genomes within MGEs such as plasmids, prophages, insertion sequences/transposons, integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) and integrons. However, it was recently found that there are relatively few R-M systems in plasmids, some in prophages, and practically none in phages. On the other hand, all these MGEs encode a large number of solitary R-M genes, notably MTases. In light of this, it is likely that R-M mobility may be less dependent on MGEs and more dependent, for example, on the existence of small genomic integration hotspots. It is also possible that R-M systems frequently exploit other mechanisms such as natural transformation, vesicles, nanotubes, gene transfer agents or <b>generalized</b> <b>transduction</b> in order to move between genomes.|$|E

40|$|A {{challenge}} in strain construction is that unmarked deletion and nucleotide substitution alleles {{generally do not}} confer selectable phenotypes. We describe here a rapid and efficient strategy for transferring such alleles via <b>generalized</b> <b>transduction.</b> The desired allele is first constructed and introduced into the chromosome by conventional allelic-exchange methods. The suicide vector containing the same allele is then integrated into the mutant chromosome, generating a tandem duplication homozygous for that allele. The resulting strain {{is used as a}} donor for transductional crosses, and selection is made for a marker carried by the integrated suicide vector. Segregation of the tandem duplication results in haploid individuals, each of which carries the desired allele. To demonstrate this mutagenesis strategy, we used bacteriophage P 22 Hint for generalized transduction-mediated introduction of unmarked mutations to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. This method is applicable to any species for which <b>generalized</b> <b>transduction</b> is established...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} genetic methods for the isolation, {{characterization}} and manipulation of large chromosomal inversions in Salmonella typhimurium are described. One inversion-carrying mutant is characterized in detail {{and used to}} demonstrate a number of unique genetic properties of bacterial inversions. —Contrary to expectation, {{it was found that}} large inversion mutations can be repaired by <b>generalized</b> <b>transduction.</b> The repair results from the simultaneous introduction of two wild-type transduced fragments into a single recipient cell. Homologous recombination between the two transduced fragments and the two inversion breakpoints causes the inverted segment to be reinverted. This results in regeneration of the wild-type orientation of this chromosome segment. Similar recombination events allow a large inversion mutation to be introduced into a wild-type strain; two transduced fragments from an inversion strain cause recombination events resulting in inversion of a large chromosome segment. —Genetic methods for mapping the extent of a large inversion mutation by <b>generalized</b> <b>transduction</b> are described and tested.

CP- 51 and CP- 54 are similar in size and morphology and are related serologically, but they are not identical. CP- 54 is more cold labile than CP- 51, and, as with CP- 51, its stability both at 0 and 15 degrees C is enhanced by the presence of 0. 02 M Mg 2 +. Some examples of cotransduction of linked markers in B. thuringiensis are presented, demonstrating the feasibility of chromosomal mapping in this organism.

In two strains of B. pumilus which {{are sensitive to}} both PBP 1 and PBS 1, co-transducible genetic markers are more tightly linked by PBS 1 transduction than by PBP 1 transduction. The size of the fragment of bacterial DNA carried by PBP 1 -transducing particles, inferred from transduction studies and sedimentation analysis of viral DNA, suggests that PBP 1 may be useful for genetic studies of extrachromosomal DNA elements present in two strains of B. pumilus.

40|$|<b>Generalized</b> <b>transduction</b> by {{bacteriophage}} P 22 occurs by {{the transfer}} of DNA from one bacterium to another {{by means of a}} phage-like particle (i. e. a transducing particle) which contains bacterial DNA formed before infection (preceding paper). Transduction of a 3 aP-labeled, light recipient with purified transducing particles whose DNA is labeled with 3 H, zH, 16 N, 13 C results in the physical association of 12 to 15 % of the transducing DNA with the DNA of the recipient bacteria. The remainder of the transducing DNA persists as unreplicated phage-size fragments during further bacterial growth. Physical and genetic analysis of the DNA integrated as large fragments reveals that recombination in <b>generalized</b> <b>transduction</b> occurs by a displacement mechanism, often resulting in the integration of double strand fragments of transducing DNA into the DNA of the recipient bacteria. The molecular weight of most of the large integrated fragments is greater than 2 to 4 x IO 8 daltons but substantially less than 27 x lo 6 daltons, the molecular weight of the transducing DNA injected into the bacteria.

40|$|Despite an {{increasing}} interest in horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, {{the role of}} <b>generalized</b> <b>transduction</b> in this process has not been well investigated yet. Certainly {{one of the reasons}} is that only a small fraction of general transducing bacteriophages have been characterized, because many bacterial hosts needed for prop-agation and identification are not culturable or are simply unknown. A method for host-independent detection of transducing bacteriophages was developed. Phage-encapsulated DNA was used as a template for PCR amplification of 16 S ribosomal DNA using primers specific for the 16 S rRNA genes of most eubacteria. Sequencing of the cloned amplification products permits the identification of the host bacteria. The Salmonella phage P 22 was used as an example. Applying this method to a sample of the supernatant of the mixed liquor in the aeration tank of an activated sludge treatment works revealed the presence of transducing phages infecting several bacterial species for which such phages have not yet been described. This method is suitable for estimating the contribution of <b>generalized</b> <b>transduction</b> to horizontal gene transfer in different habitats.
