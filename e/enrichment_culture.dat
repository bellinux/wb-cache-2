2500|$|Bartonella {{growth rates}} improve when cultured in an {{enrichment}} inoculation {{step in a}} liquid insect-based medium [...] such as Bartonella α-Proteobacteria Growth Medium (BAPGM) [...] or Schneider’s Drosophila-based insect powder medium. Several studies have optimized the growing conditions of Bartonella spp. cultures in these liquid media, with no change in bacterial protein expressions or host interactions in vitro. Insect-based liquid media supports the growth and co-culturing of at least seven Bartonella species, reduces bacterial culturing time and facilitates PCR detection and isolation of Bartonella spp. from animal and patient samples.

This study addressed the very limited understanding of the distribution, diversity and substrate specificity of such bacteria from 13 soil samples, varying in levels of HCH contamination, from four sites in Spain. Hexachlorocyclohexane removal occurred in 16 of 36 <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures.</b> Hexachlorocyclohexane-degrading populations were clearly associated with HCH-contaminated soils, and populations growing on the delta-HCH isomer were only found in soil contaminated with delta-HCH. beta-Hexachlorocyclohexane was persistent in <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures,</b> {{and there was no}} evidence for populations growing on beta-HCH. From alpha- and gamma-HCH <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures,</b> nine HCH-degrading isolates were obtained, which were all Sphingomonas spp. Attempts to isolate organisms from delta-HCH <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures</b> failed. None of the isolates grew on HCH as a sole organic substrate in pure culture. All isolates degraded alpha- and gamma-HCH, and most degraded beta-HCH. delta-Hexachlorocyclohexane inhibited growth of most isolates, but could be degraded by cell suspensions of at least four strains.

Bacteria enriched and isolated from contaminated soils under these conditions were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing of PCR-amplified 16 S ribosomal DNA segments. Compared to DGGE patterns obtained with <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures</b> containing sand or no sorptive solid phase, different DGGE patterns were obtained with <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures</b> containing phenanthrene sorbed to beads of Amberlite IRC- 50 (AMB), a weak cation-exchange resin, and especially Biobead SM 7 (SM 7), a polyacrylic resin that sorbed phenanthrene more strongly. SM 7 enrichments selected for mycobacterial phenanthrene mineralizers, whereas AMB enrichments selected for a Burkholderia sp. that degrades phenanthrene. Identical mycobacterial and Burkholderia 16 S rRNA sequence segments were found in SM 7 and AMB <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures</b> inoculated with contaminated soil from two geographically distant sites. Other closely related Burkholderia sp. populations, some of which utilized phenanthrene, were detected in sand and control <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures.</b> Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that different phenanthrene-utilizing bacteria inhabiting the same soils may be adapted to different phenanthrene bioavailabilities...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{methanol}} addition and consumption on chloroform degradation rate and product distribution in methanogenic methanol <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures</b> and in cultures of Methanosarcina barkeri 227 were investigated. Degradation of chloroform with initial concentrations up to 27. 3 microM in <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures</b> and 4. 8 microM in pure cultures was {{stimulated by the}} addition of methanol. However, methanol consumption was inhibited by as little as 2. 5 microM chloroform in <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures</b> and 0. 8 microM chloroform in pure cultures, suggesting that the presence of methanol, not its exact concentration or consumption rate, was the most significant variable affecting chloroform degradation rate. Methanol addition also significantly increased the number of moles of dichloromethane produced per mole of chloroform consumed. In <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures,</b> the number of moles of dichloromethane produced per mole of chloroform consumed ranged from 0. 7 (methanol consumption essentially uninhibited) to 0. 35 (methanol consumption significantly inhibited) to less than 0. 2 (methanol not added to the culture). In pure cultures, the number of moles of dichloromethane produced per mole of chloroform consumed was 0. 47 when methanol was added and 0. 24 when no methanol was added. Studies with [14 C]chloroform in both <b>enrichment</b> and pure <b>cultures</b> confirmed that methanol metabolism stimulated dichloromethane production compared with CO 2 production. The results indicate that while the addition of methanol significantly stimulated chloroform degradation in both methanogenic methanol <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures</b> and cultures of M. barkeri 227, the prospects for use of methanol as a growth substrate for anaerobic chloroform-degrading systems may be limited unless the increased production of undesirable chloroform degradation products and the inhibition of methanol consumption can be mitigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of two alkali-tolerant, lignocellulolytic environmental <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures</b> {{to improve the}} anaerobic fermentation of Ca(OH) 2 -pre-treated wheat straw was studied. The biomethane {{potential of}} pre-treated straw was 36 % {{higher than that of}} untreated straw. The bioaugmentation of pre-treated straw with the <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures</b> did not enhance the methane yield, but accelerated the methane production during the first week. In acidogenic leach-bed fermenters, a 61 % higher volatile fatty acid (VFA) production and a 112 % higher gas production, mainly CO 2, were observed when pre-treated instead of untreated straw was used. With one of the two <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures</b> as the inoculum, instead of the standard inoculum, the VFA production increased by an additional 36 % and the gas production by an additional 110 %, again mainly CO 2. Analysis of the microbial communities in the leach-bed processes revealed similar bacterial compositions in the fermenters with pre-treated straw, which developed independently of the used inoculum.

40|$|Microbial {{assemblage}} in an n-alkanes-dependent thermophilic methanogenic <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures</b> {{derived from}} production waters of a high-temperature petroleum reservoir {{was investigated in}} this study. Substantially higher amounts of methane were generated from the <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures</b> incubated at 55 °C for 528 days {{with a mixture of}} long-chain n-alkanes (C 15 -C 20). Stoichiometric estimation showed that alkanes-dependent methanogenesis accounted for about 19. 8 % of the total amount of methane expected. Hydrogen was occasionally detected together with methane in the gas phase of the cultures. Chemical analysis of the liquid cultures resulted only in low concentrations of acetate and formate. Phylogenetic analysis of the enrichment revealed the presence of several bacterial taxa related to Firmicutes, Thermodesulfobiaceae, Thermotogaceae, Nitrospiraceae, Dictyoglomaceae, Candidate division OP 8 and others without close cultured representatives, and Archaea predominantly related to uncultured members in the order Archaeoglobales and CO 2 -reducing methanogens. Screening of genomic DNA retrieved from the alkanesamended <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures</b> also suggested the presence of new alkylsuccinate synthase alpha-subunit (assA) homologues. These findings suggest the presence of poorly characterized (putative) anaerobic n-alkanes degraders in the thermophilic methanogenic <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures.</b> Our results indicate that methanogenesis of alkanes under thermophilic condition is likely to proceed via syntrophic acetate and/or formate oxidation linked with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. © Springer-Verlag 2012. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The depletion of o-xylene was correlated to and dependent on the metabolism of toluene. No losses of benzene, p-xylene, or m-xylene were observed in these initial <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures.</b> However, m-xylene was degraded by a subculture that was incubated on m-xylene alone. Complete carbon, nitrogen, and electron balances were determined for the degradation of toluene and m-xylene. These balances showed that these compounds were mineralized with greater than 50 % conversion to CO 2 and significant assimilation into biomass. Additionally, the oxidation of these compounds was shown to be dependent on nitrate reduction and denitrification.

40|$|Microbial methane {{from coal}} beds {{accounts}} for a significant and growing percentage of natural gas worldwide. Our knowledge of physical and geochemical factors regulating methanogenesis {{is still in its}} infancy. We hypothesized that in these closed systems, trace elements (as micronutrients) are a limiting factor for methanogenic growth and activity. Trace elements are essential components of enzymes or cofactors of metabolic pathways associated with methanogenesis. This study examined the effects of eight trace elements (iron, nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc, manganese, boron, and copper) on methane production, on mcrA transcript levels, and on methanogenic community structure in <b>enrichment</b> <b>cultures</b> obtained from coal bed methane (CBM) well produced water samples from the Powder River Basin, Wyoming.
