5|$|Such long-distance {{high-speed}} railways are {{not included}} in the preliminary long-term plan for 2010–2040, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> railways Hamar–Trondheim and Drammen–Kristansand will be built first since they are easier to build. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> a high-speed railway to Bergen will be built sometime in the period 2030–2060.|$|E

5|$|A {{commercial}} document from 30 January 1359, which testifies to John's continuing {{trade relations with}} Venice, is chronologically the last reference to his activity in contemporary sources.

5|$|According to Dio Cassius, he inflicted genocidal depredations on {{the natives}} and {{incurred}} {{the loss of}} 50,000 of his own men to the attrition of guerrilla tactics, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> these figures are a significant exaggeration.|$|E
5|$|Almost any {{substance}} containing sugar can naturally undergo alcoholic fermentation. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> many cultures, on {{observing that}} a sweet liquid {{could be obtained}} from a source of starch, independently invented beer.

5|$|As a diplodocid, it is {{probable}} that Dinheirosaurus possessed a whip-tail. If it did, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> its tail could be used like a bullwhip, with supersonic speed. Being related to both Apatosaurus and Diplodocus, Dinheirosaurus probably possessed a squared snout. This means that it was probably a non-selective ground-feeding sauropod.|$|E
5|$|Ecgberht {{was buried}} in Winchester, as were his son, Æthelwulf, his grandson, Alfred the Great, and his great-grandson, Edward the Elder.

5|$|Excavation has {{revealed}} remnants of oak, {{some of it}} from trees hundreds of years old. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> this came from various sources; some from nearby, and some donated from the forests at Delamere and Macclesfield.

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Bede's work, {{because it}} was so widely copied, {{discouraged}} others from writing histories and may even have led to the disappearance of manuscripts containing older historical works.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Hoffmann did as most chemists {{have always}} done, {{starting}} {{by studying the}} literature and recreating the published methods.

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> {{at least}} some of this change, {{particularly}} over Europe, is due to decreases in airborne pollution. Most governments of developed nations have taken steps to reduce aerosols released into the atmosphere, which helps reduce global dimming.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the tonal {{lowering}} seen in {{this particular}} example {{is related to the}} low tone nasal prefix found in future tense constructions in some other Senufo languages. In fact, Supyire shows a similar phenomenon in future tense constructions with a direct object (in other future tense constructions, a low tone nasal is found).|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the {{traditional}} use of narcissi {{for the treatment}} of cancer was due to the presence of isocarbostyril constituents such as narciclasine, pancratistatin and their congeners.

5|$|Marsh joined Alexander's Hippodrome Company, {{travelling}} around Australia in a sideshow, {{where his}} cricketing fame brought much attention.

In retirement, Marsh drank heavily and was jailed for 14 days for committing an assault in Melbourne in 1909, something he blamed on alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{surviving}} prehistoric stone monuments on Exmoor are located on those areas of moorland outside the limits of medieval and post-medieval agriculture.
