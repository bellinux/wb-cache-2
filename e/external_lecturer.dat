30|$|Our {{results show}} that the form of {{employment}} (internal or external) has a statistically significant impact on the activities of lecturers in the field of their social competencies. Activities related to social competencies are influenced by the lecturers’ form of employment. It {{can be explained by the}} fact that external employees are not necessarily closely linked to their organization. As they are not internal employees, they are less sensitive to the relationships within the organization and to the relationships with the participants of education. <b>External</b> <b>lecturers</b> may, on one hand, keep distance and have a detachment regarding the above-mentioned relationships, on the other hand, they do not have to recognize nor to perceive the possible problems inside the organization. All these circumstances can influence their activities related to social competencies.|$|R

40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{analyzes}} {{the current situation}} (associated with high turnover) in the work team of selected company. Theoretical bases are describing problem of fluctuation, elements of motivation and satisfaction of employees. These elements are evaluated {{with the help of}} questionnaires and surveys so we can find out real and possible causes of employees leaving the company. Each of these causes has its own effective solutions which can reduce the turnover of employees in the team. There is an established inefficient career growth of an operator in the work teams which should be replaced by one meeting the requirements of the operators. The most common reasons for leaving are other job opportunities, salary, performance bonuses, job content, supervisor, lack of time and fees. This applies to more than 50 % of the staff. Former employees have agreed that the final reason for leaving was their supervisor. Trainings of managerial skills by <b>external</b> <b>lecturers</b> which are specialists in the field could help create quality background for management of the company and would be beneficial for current leaders. Conducting regular surveys of the staff's satisfaction, evaluation of the operator of the month, evaluation of the team of the month, loyalty benefits of the long-term employed operators, differentiation of work, new kinds of rewards, fees elimination, new leadership and increased awareness of operators would help to run the company more efficiently...|$|R
