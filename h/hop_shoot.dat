40|$|Humulus lupulus L., {{commonly}} named hop, {{is well-known}} for its sedative and estrogenic activity. While hop cones are widely characterized, only few works {{have been carried}} out on the young shoots of this plant. In the light of this, the aim {{of this study was to}} identify for the first time the flavonoids present in young hop shoots and to compare the composition of samples harvested from different locations in Northern Italy with their antioxidant activity. The samples were extracted by means of dynamic maceration with methanol. The HPLC-UV/DAD, HPLC-ESI-MS and MS 2 analysis were carried out by using an Ascentis C 18 column (250  ×  4. 6  mm I. D., 5  μm), with a mobile phase composed of 0. 1  M formic acid in both water and acetonitrile, under gradient elution. Quercetin and kaempferol glycosides were the main compounds identified and quantified in <b>hop</b> <b>shoot</b> extracts. Total flavonols ranged from 2698  ±  185 to 517  ±  48  μg/g (fresh weight). The antioxidant activity was determined by means of the radical scavenging activity assay against diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH[rad]) and by using a photochemiluscence assay with a Photochem® apparatus. The results showed that hop shoots represent a new source of flavonols; therefore, they can be useful for a possible incorporation in the diet as a functional food or applied in the nutraceutical ambit...|$|E

He also suggests roasting vegetables wrapped in damp paper over charcoal or embers with a drizzle of olive oil. Castelvetro's book is separated into seasons with <b>hop</b> <b>shoots</b> {{in the spring}} and truffles in the winter, detailing the use of pigs in the search for truffles.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{frequently}} {{referred to}} as the hops [...] "vine", it is technically a bine; unlike vines, which use tendrils, suckers, and other appendages for attaching themselves, bines have stout stems with stiff hairs to aid in climbing. It is a perennial herbaceous plant which sends up new shoots in early spring and dies back to the cold-hardy rhizome in autumn. <b>Hop</b> <b>shoots</b> grow very rapidly, and at the peak of growth can grow 20 to 50 cm per week. Hop bines climb by wrapping clockwise (except for Humulus japonicus) around anything within reach, and individual bines typically grow between 2 to 15 m depending on what is available to grow on. The leaves are opposite, with a 7 to 12 cm leafstalk and a heart-shaped, fan-lobed blade 12 to 25 cm long and broad; the edges are coarsely toothed. When the hop bines run out of material to climb, horizontal shoots sprout between the leaves of the main stem to form a network of stems wound round each other.|$|R
50|$|Podosphaera macularis overwinters on {{the soil}} surface in debris as fungal {{survival}} structures (chasmothecia) or as mycelia in plant buds. These chasmothecia are formed closer {{to the end of}} the growing season. The characteristic morphology of chasmothecia of Hop Powdery Mildew are spherical black structures with spiked appendages. When favorable conditions are encountered during early spring, the asci (sac-like structures) within chasmothecia will rupture and ascospores will be discharged. Specifically, the favorable conditions for ascospore release include low light, excess fertility, and high soil moisture. Additionally, optimal infection is observed when the temperature is between 18 and 25 °C. Furthermore, the ascospores act as the primary inoculum and are dispersed passively by wind. Upon encountering a susceptible host plant, the ascospores will germinate and cause infection. Following infection, masses of asexual spores (conidia) will be produced during the season. It is these masses of conidia that contribute to the characteristic white, powdery appearance of infected plants. The lower leaves are the most affected, but the disease can appear on any part of the plant that is above the ground. These conidia are dispersed through wind. Thus, Podosphaera macularis is a polycyclic pathogen as conidia are produced/dispersed during the growing season and can further infect additional host plants. Particularly, the disease will be noticeable on infected plants as soon as the <b>hop</b> <b>shoots</b> start to emerge with the latent period being approximately 10 days at 12 and 15°C compared to 5 days at 18-27°C. These spore-covered shoots that emerge from infected buds are called “flag shoots” and will be stunted with distorted leaves. Periods of rapid plant growth are the most favorable for infection. In addition, the period in which lateral branch development takes place within the plants is also very vulnerable to the development of the disease. Due to Podosphaera macularis causing local infection, only the location of the host plant tissue where spores have landed will develop the disease.|$|R
50|$|Though the player's main {{vehicle is}} the biplane, {{they can still}} {{continue}} on foot if their plane is shot down. The player can attack with a handgun while on foot, and can also ride various vehicles found {{along the way to}} make the progress easier. The vehicles include various animals such as giraffes, elephants, and horses, pogo sticks, bicycles, motorcycles, jeeps, and several types of robots that can <b>hop</b> and <b>shoot</b> missiles. Though the biplane {{is by far the most}} effective unit in terms of game completion, the presence of the ground units adds another layer of amusement to the game. Wolf Fang was developed and released in Japan by Data East a year prior to Boogie Wings, and the vehicles in Boogie Wings were derived from the gameplay in Wolf Fang, where the player could continue on foot even after their robot was destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|Los Angeles Times {{gave the}} show its highest score, with 70/100, commenting {{that the show}} [...] "is not merely pandering to the teenage base. 'Jane by Design' is a font of {{fulfilled}} wishes, but they come from actual work, even if that work is presented in kicky-fun, pop-driven montage. The show is aspirational and at times genuinely exciting. You care enough about Jane, {{thanks in large part}} to Dasher, who is charming and funny, that you want her to have her cake and her ice cream too." [...] Pittsburgh Post-Gazette saying [...] "Jane is a decent enough little show but it's difficult to imagine how its writers will manage to sustain the premise." [...] People Weekly compared with Ugly Betty TV Guide gave the show with negative critical and says [...] "A toothless hourlong teen-com." [...] "If stealing from The Devil Wears Prada wasn't enough, there are also echoes of the far superior Ugly Betty in the workplace (including an evil co-worker out for Andie's job) and Pretty in Pink at school, where Jane hangs with a faux-hawked hipster misfit best bud who somehow isn't named Duckie. In the first episode, Jane risks missing a vital midterm if she attends a critical meeting called by her boss's rival. In the second episode, once again double-booked, she races back and forth between a high-fashion preview party and the school's winter formal, where she's scored a date with the jock she has long pined for (shades of MTV's awesome Awkward, though this is merely inept). Guess whose self-constructed party dress ends up on the runway? If only it all weren't so synthetic. How long before Jane has to choose between graduation and a cover <b>shoot?</b> <b>Hoping</b> for better later this week when Project Runway: All Stars premieres." ...|$|R
