5|$|Eight 6-car trains {{supplied}} by CAF Beasain were imported from Spain. CAF held 5% {{equity in the}} DAME project, and Reliance Infrastructure held the remaining 95% before DMRC took over the operations. The trains on this line are of a premium standard compared to the existing metro trains and have in-built noise reduction and padded fabric seats. The coaches are equipped with LCD screens for entertainment of the passengers and also provide flight information for convenience of air travellers. The trains are fitted with an <b>event</b> <b>recorder</b> which can withstand high levels of temperature and impact and the wheels have flange lubrication system for less noise and better riding comfort.|$|E

25|$|On October 6, 2016, the NTSB {{released}} its findings {{based on the}} <b>event</b> <b>recorder</b> and video recorders. According to its report, 38 seconds prior to the crash, the train's engineer accelerated from 8 mph and was traveling at 21 mph on impact, {{more than twice the}} speed limit of 10 mph. The engineer attempted the emergency braking procedure less than a second before the crash.|$|E
25|$|After 20 hours, {{the centre}} of the fire was still {{inaccessible}} to firefighters and five pools of fuel were still burning. A special fire-retardant foam was brought from an Ultramar refinery in Lévis, aiding progress by firefighters on the Saturday night. Five of the unexploded cars were doused with high-pressure water to prevent further explosions, and two were still burning and at risk of exploding 36 hours later. The train's <b>event</b> <b>recorder</b> was recovered at around 15:00 the next day and the fire was finally extinguished in the evening, after burning for nearly two days.|$|E
500|$|On 19 November, SNCF {{announced}} the initial findings of their investigation. The train's <b>event</b> <b>recorder</b> {{indicated that the}} train entered the curve at [...] and was travelling at [...] at the moment it derailed, which investigators have determined to {{be a result of}} centrifugal forces. The speed at the moment of derailment was [...] above the train's assigned operating speed on the curve. According to the SNCF, the [...] "immediate cause" [...] of the accident was [...] "a late braking sequence"; the braking should have begun at least [...] or 12 seconds earlier. The investigation has found no fault for the accident in the infrastructure, train, or member of the technical team. There were seven people in the driving cab {{at the time of the}} accident, all of whom survived. Investigators have suggested that this may have been a factor in the late braking. SNCF will begin disciplinary proceedings and take punitive measures against employees responsible for, among other things, the [...] "reckless presence" [...] of children on the test train, presence of seven people in the cab, the lack of rigor in creating lists of those onboard and controlling access to the train, and [...] "without doubt" [...] the human errors in the cab.|$|E

2500|$|Train stops {{are used}} to enforce stop {{indications}} on signals—should a train pass a signal, the train's brakes will automatically be applied.

The [...] "VICERS" [...] vigilance control and <b>event</b> <b>recorder</b> system is also being currently fitted to suburban trains to provide an additional level of safety.|$|E
2500|$|The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) is also {{investigating}} the accident, {{with data from}} the tram's on-board <b>event</b> <b>recorder</b> being analysed. The RAIB stated that initial indications suggest that the tram was travelling at a significantly higher speed than permitted. Rail magazine reported that the tram's electro-magnetic track brakes had not been activated. Following the accident, The Guardian reported that on 31 October there had been passenger allegations made on Facebook of a tram travelling round the curve at excessive speed. The Evening Standard reports an earlier passenger complaint describing the tram as [...] "tipping" [...] on the curve. The driver of the tram involved in the incident of 31 October was not the one involved in the accident on 9 November.|$|E

50|$|France {{developed}} the Flaman Speed Indicator and Recorder. In Germany, the Indusi train protection system had included recording equipment from early on using a ticker tape on paper. For I60R a generalized recorder system was installed (Datenspeicherkassette DSK / data storage cassette) that {{allowed to enter}} the train number, driver info, train weight along with the driving events. The standardized DSK black box allows for approximately 30,000 km of general recording data and 90 km of detailed recording data. Later models of the DSK are electronic especially since {{the introduction of the}} computerized PZ80/PZB90 train protection generations.Modern Train <b>Event</b> <b>Recorders</b> follow International or National Standards like IEEE Std. 1482.1-1999, FRA 49 CFR Part 229, IEC 62625-1 etc. specifying the digital and analogue data to be acquired, recorded and transmitted for further analysis. The need for <b>event</b> <b>recorders</b> to sustain an accident has led to companies like Faiveley (France), Hasler Rail (Switzerland), Bach-Simpson (USA), Saira Electronics (Italy) FAR Systems, MIOS Elettronica (Italy) to develop crash protected memory modules as a part of their <b>event</b> <b>recorders.</b> These new generation <b>event</b> <b>recorders</b> have growing demand both for rapid transit systems and mainline trains, in Europe, United States,India, etc.|$|R

If <b>Event</b> Data <b>Recorder</b> information falls into the wrong hands, the possession of the data raises serious privacy concerns.

40|$|To date, {{various types}} of cardiac <b>event</b> <b>recorders</b> are {{clinically}} available in our country.

In this report, we reviewed historical perspective of electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and attempted to compare the characteristics and clinical availability of these commercialized <b>event</b> <b>recorders.</b> Conclusively, {{we would like to}} address the importance of pre-event segment recording. Loop recorder usually catches the instantaneous arrhythmias by pre-event recording under the continuous electrode arrangement, whereas non-loop recorder sometimes fails to catch them {{due in part to the}} sluggish patients activation.
