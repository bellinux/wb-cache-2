5|$|Returning to Salisbury in January 1980, Mugabe {{was greeted}} by a {{supportive}} crowd. He settled into a house in Mount Pleasant, a wealthy white-dominated suburb. Machel had cautioned Mugabe not to alienate Rhodesia's white minority, warning him that any white flight after the election would cause economic damage {{as it had in}} Mozambique. Accordingly, during his electoral campaign Mugabe avoided the use of Marxist and revolutionary rhetoric. Mugabe insisted that in the election, ZANU would stand as a separate party to ZAPU, and refused Nkomo's request for a meeting. He formed ZANU into a political party, known as Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF). Predictions were made that ZANU-PF would win the election {{on the basis of the}} country's ethnic divisions; Mugabe was Shona, a community that made up around 70% of the country's population, while Nkomo was Ndebele, a tribal group who made up only around 20%. <b>For</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> the white community and in the British government, this outcome was a terrifying prospect due to Mugabe's avowed Marxist beliefs and the inflammatory comments that he had made about whites during the guerrilla war.|$|E

25|$|A {{generalized}} Left Wing {{had existed}} prior to 1919, but lacked organizational cohesion.

25|$|From ancient Norse, Baltic and Celtic mythologies, to the Nigerian, Indian and Mongolian cosmological thought, {{extending}} {{far east}} in the ancient Shinto faith of Japan and the special habits of the 19 tribes of the forest peoples of Malaysia, sacred groves provide relief and shelter from the mundane aspects of life and are considered living temples. A place of meeting where ancient rituals are performed, {{it is also a}} place of refuge <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> times of danger.|$|E
25|$|Following the Battle of France and {{the second}} French-German armistice, signed near Compiègne on 22 June 1940, life <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> France {{continued}} more or less normally at first, but soon the German occupation authorities and the collaborationist Vichy régime began to employ increasingly brutal and intimidating tactics to ensure the submission of the French population. Although the majority of civilians neither collaborated nor overtly resisted, the occupation of French territory and the Germans' draconian policies inspired a discontented minority to form paramilitary groups dedicated to both active and passive resistance.|$|E

25|$|Although {{ritualism}} had {{an aesthetic}} and ideological appeal <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> the cultural elite, {{and had a}} cognate relationship with the Gothic Revival, {{the idea that it}} was inextricably linked with an inclination towards political despotism was a misapprehension. Ritualism had an appeal for many who were politically conservative and had supporters highly placed in the establishment (e.g. Viscount Halifax and the 4th Marquess of Bath). However, the outlook of many of the ritualist clergy themselves, many of whom inevitably operated {{in some of the most}} deprived communities in England, resulted in their becoming politically radicalised by the experience – some became ardent Christian Socialists.|$|E
25|$|Benedict's {{idea was}} to build a model monastery for England, sharing his {{knowledge}} of the experience of the Church in Europe. It was the first ecclesiastical building in Britain to be built in stone, and the use of glass was a novelty <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> 7th-century England. It eventually possessed what was a large library for the time – several hundred volumes – and it was here that Benedict's student Bede wrote his famous works. The library became world-famous and manuscripts that had been copied there became prized possessions throughout Europe, including especially the Codex Amiatinus, the earliest surviving manuscript of the complete Bible in the Latin Vulgate version.|$|E
25|$|When the {{population}} settled down the society greatly changed, first coexisting {{with the older}} societies, later absorbing them. Trade became much more important, a political institution elected by the people came into existence, the very same institution whose successor is the current County Council. Jämtland got its name and a somewhat hierarchical social structure emerged, though, as already pointed out, Jämtland never had an upper class. Strong families such as Skanke and Blix did exist though and on the countryside in Jämtland people still live in networks of relatives, families. Where they provide a second social security <b>for</b> <b>many,</b> <b>in</b> the rest of Sweden and in e.g. Östersund this has completely or almost entirely been replaced by public welfare.|$|E

25|$|On 26 August, Aung San Suu Kyi, who {{had watched}} the demonstrations from her mother's bedside, entered the {{political}} arena by addressing {{half a million people}} at Shwedagon Pagoda. It was at this point that she became a symbol for the struggle in Burma, particularly {{in the eyes of the}} Western world. Kyi, as the daughter of Aung San, who led the independence movement, appeared ready to lead the movement for democracy. Kyi urged the crowd not to turn on the army but find peace through non-violent means. At this point in time <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> Burma, the uprising was seen as similar to that of the People Power Revolution in the Philippines in 1986.|$|E
25|$|Nureyev's {{production}} of La Bayadère was presented {{for the first}} time at the Palais Garnier (or the Paris Opéra) on October 8, 1992 with Isabelle Guérin as Nikiya, Laurent Hilaire as Solor, and Élisabeth Platel as Gamzatti (and was later filmed in 1994 and released onto DVD/video with the same cast). The theatre was filled with many of the most prominent people of the ballet world, along with throngs of newspaper and television reporters from around the world. The production was a resounding success, with Nureyev being honored with the prestigious Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the French Minister of Culture. The premiere of Nureyev's production was a special occasion <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> the world of ballet, as only three months later he died.|$|E
25|$|The major {{sticking}} point <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> {{the question of}} human evolution was whether human mental faculties could have possibly been evolved. The gap between humans and even the smartest ape seemed too large, {{even for those who}} were sympathetic to Darwin's basic theory. Alfred Russel Wallace, the co-discoverer of evolution by natural selection, believed that the human mind was too complex to have evolved gradually, and began over time to subscribe to a theory of evolution that took more from spiritualism than it did the natural world. Darwin was deeply distressed by Wallace's change of heart, and much of the Descent of Man is in response to opinions put forth by Wallace. Darwin focuses less {{on the question of whether}} humans evolved than he does on showing that each of the human faculties considered to be so far beyond those of beasts—such as moral reasoning, sympathy for others, beauty, and music—can be seen in kind (if not degree) in other animal species (usually apes and dogs).|$|E

25|$|One of {{the issues}} that many {{researchers}} and wolfdog communities are faced with is identifying wolfdogs from pure dogs and any of the wolf species mixed into the hybrid. The most common method used by various wolfdog communities is phenotyping, a method that involves observing the animal's physical features. This method is often favoured <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> determining the degree of wolf and northern spitz-type dog that is in a hybrid. However, a lot of criticisms have been made by opponents within some communities who tend to point out that phenotyping cannot always determine the wolf-contents accurately. Another challenge involves determining exactly the domestic breeds and wolf subspecies involved in the admixture {{due to the fact that}} dogs are known to come in various breeds while gray wolves in turn come in various subspecies with many different regional ecotypes hence have different physical features depending on the subspecies used in the breeding. Although wolves are often mixed with spitz types such as Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, and German Shepherds, hybrids between wolves to non-Spitz type dogs such as Poodles, Pit bulls, and Great Pyrenees also exist, the latter hybrids often having less lupine features.|$|E
25|$|Passive {{crossovers}} {{are commonly}} installed inside speaker boxes and {{are by far}} the most usual type of crossover for home and low-power use. In car audio systems, passive crossovers may be in a separate box, necessary to accommodate the size of the components used. Passive crossovers may be simple for low-order filtering, or complex to allow steep slopes such as 18 or 24dB per octave. Passive crossovers can also be designed to compensate for undesired characteristics of driver, horn, or enclosure resonances, and can be tricky to implement, due to component interaction. Passive crossovers, like the driver units that they feed, have power handling limits, have insertion losses (10% is often claimed), and change the load seen by the amplifier. The changes are matters of concern <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> the hi-fi world. When high output levels are required, active crossovers may be preferable. Active crossovers may be simple circuits that emulate the response of a passive network, or may be more complex, allowing extensive audio adjustments. Some active crossovers, usually digital loudspeaker management systems, may include electronics and controls for precise alignment of phase and time between frequency bands, equalization, dynamic range compression and limiting) control.|$|E
