2500|$|There {{has been}} some major concern for the {{population}} in the Mekong River due to numerous threats. In the 1970s, many Irrawaddy Dolphins were slaughtered for oil and soon after, there was intensive <b>fishing</b> practices <b>with</b> <b>explosives</b> and gill nets [...] As of right now, the dolphins are protected in Cambodia and Laos Democratic Republic. Now, both explosive fishing and use of gill nets is restricted in many of the Irrawaddy Dolphin's habitats. Canadian conservationist Ian Baird set up the Lao Community Fisheries and Dolphin Protection Project to study the Irrawaddy dolphins in the Lao part of the Mekong. Part of this project compensated fishers for the loss of nets damaged to free entangled dolphins. This project was expanded to include Cambodia, after the majority of the dolphin population was determined to have been killed or migrated to Laos' southern neighbour. The Si Phan Don Wetlands Project has successfully encouraged river communities to set aside conservation zones and establish laws to regulate how and when fish are caught. In April, after a 200kg Irrawaddy Dolphin was found dead on the coast of Laos, the death toll for Irrawaddy Dolphins is now five in the year 2015. Usually, Irrawaddy Dolphins are found dead with bruises and scars on their body being killed by illegal poaching, however this Irrawaddy Dolphin was found dead because of old age. She is the oldest and largest Irrawaddy Dolphin researchers have discovered. The dolphin was 2.5 meters in length and most likely in her late 20's. The body will be taken to the WWF office for an autopsy of the body.|$|R

These poisonous mixtures would stun fish, which would then come to the surface and be collected by the fishermen.
