5000|$|Sometimes a {{distinction}} is made between [...] "fixed" [...] and [...] "flexible" [...] designs. In some cases, these types coincide with {{quantitative and qualitative}} research designs respectively, though this need not be the case. In fixed designs, {{the design of the}} study is fixed before the main stage of data collection takes place. Fixed designs are normally theory-driven; otherwise, {{it is impossible to know}} in advance which variables need to be controlled and measured. Often, these variables are measured quantitatively. Flexible designs allow for more freedom <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> process. One reason for using a flexible research design can be that the variable of interest is not quantitatively measurable, such as culture. In other cases, theory might not be available before one starts the research.|$|E
5000|$|Operationalization uses a {{different}} logic when testing a formal (quantitative) hypothesis and testing working hypothesis (qualitative). For formal hypotheses the concepts are represented empirically (or operationalized) as numeric variables and tested using inferential statistics. Working hypotheses (particularly {{in the social}} and administrative sciences), on the other hand, are tested through evidence collection and the assessment of the evidence. The evidence is generally collected {{within the context of a}} case study. The researcher asks - Is the evidence sufficient to 'support' the working hypothesis? Formal operationalization would specify the kinds of evidence needed to support the hypothesis as well as evidence which would [...] "fail" [...] to support it. Robert Yin recommends developing a case study protocol as a way to specify the kinds of evidence needed <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> phases.

50|$|Evaluation is {{monitoring}} and assessing {{the process and}} impact of policy implementation. Policy research and analysis are used as strategies to evaluate whether the policy goals were reached, {{and if there were}} any unanticipated positive or negative outcomes. The evaluation process also attempts to see the various types of impacts: direct versus indirect, and short term versus long term. The information gathered from the evaluation will be used as inputs in the next policy cycle or process. Policy {{monitoring and}} evaluation is usually a challenging step as it requires consistent follow up, information collection, and efforts to compare policy goals with the outcome of activities carried out to implement the policy. The policy goals serve as a framework for any instrument that is designed to collect and compile information for the evaluation. The instruments that are designed should ensure that gender is included as a category of analysis and that issues concerning both men and women are included in the questions. Specific women’s issues, as identified in the policy problem, should be covered, and <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> process both men and women should be included as sources of data. In the context of TEIs the data to be gathered on enrolment, performance and achievement, in-service training, promotion, leadership and administration are to be disaggregated by sex.|$|E
5000|$|In their {{article in}} which they coin the term 'critical data studies,' Dalton and Thatcher also provide several {{justifications}} as to why data studies is a discipline worthy of a critical approach. Firstly, 'big data' is {{an important aspect of}} twenty-first century society, and the analysis of 'big data' allows for a deeper understanding of what is happening and for what reasons. Furthermore, big data as a technological tool and the information that it yields are not neutral, according to Dalton and Thatcher, making it worthy of critical analysis in order to identify and address its biases. Building off this idea, another justification for a critical approach is that the relationship between big data and society is an important one, and therefore worthy of study. [...] Dalton and Thatcher stress how the relationship is not an example of technological determinism, but rather how big data can shape the lives of individuals. Big data technology can cause significant changes in society's structure and in the everyday lives of people, and being a product of society, big data technology is worthy of sociological investigation. Moreover, data sets are almost never completely raw, that is to say without any influences. Dalton and Thatcher describe how data are shaped by the vision or goals of a research team, and <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> process, certain things are quantified, stored, sorted and even discarded by the research team. A critical approach is thus necessary in order to understand and reveal the intent behind the information being presented. Dalton and Thatcher also argue how data alone cannot speak for itself; in order to possess any concrete meaning, data must be accompanied by theoretical insight or be accompanied by alternative quantitative or qualitative research measures. Dalton and Thatcher argue that if one were to only think of data in terms of its exploitative power, there is no possibility of using data for revolutionary, liberatory purposes. Finally, Dalton and Thatcher propose that a critical approach in studying data allows for 'big data' to be combined with older, 'small data,' and thus create more thorough research, opening up more opportunities, questions and topics to be explored.|$|E
