On Madge's advice she {{took her to a}} voluble little woman in the Earl's Court Road who was struck at once by Madame Phillips's remarkable resemblance to the Baroness von Stein. Had not Joan noticed it? Whatever suited the Baroness von Stein--allowed by common consent {{to be one of the}} best-dressed women in London--was bound to show up Madame Phillips to equal advantage. By curious coincidence a costume for the Baroness had been put in hand only the day before. It was sent for and pinned upon the delighted Madame Phillips. Perfection! As the Baroness herself would always say: [...] "My frock must be a framework <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality.</b> It must never obtrude." [...] The supremely well-dressed woman! One never notices what she has on: that is the test. It seemed it was what Mrs. Phillips had always felt herself. Joan could have kissed the voluble, emphatic little woman.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} {{to serve as a}} supporting document for the exhibition Collective Case Studies that was held in The Gallery, at Sheridan College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning. In Collective Case Studies, the head sculptures act as blank slates <b>for</b> <b>my</b> expression of <b>personality</b> archetypes. They embody a longstanding interest in the psyche, character and identity that continues to influence my art-making practice. These sculptures introduce a particular personality trait or present a case study to make human idiosyncrasies manifest in visual terms, both individually and relationally. Collectively, the works are inspired by psycho-social aspects of personality, including archetypes and stereotypes, in the past and present time. The leading sources <b>for</b> <b>my</b> work are psychological, cross-cultural and empirical...|$|R

40|$|Thank you to Harvey Newman, my advisor, {{for being}} my {{model of a}} brilliant, meticulous scientist. Thank you for the passion you bring to your work {{every day of the}} week, and for {{mentoring}} me for all of these years. Thank you to my parents, Yamin Ma and Ying Xue, for overcoming many obstacles to bring me to the US, and raise me here. It has been a much better match <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> and sensitivities, and I am appreciative of the opportunity. Thank you to Vladimir Litvin for helping me at the start of my time at Caltech, from our very first Higgs analysis and onward. Thank you to Toyoko Orimoto for taking me under your wing since you first came to our group as a Milliken Fellow, and for our continued collaboration on many analyses. Thank you to my group members at Caltech: Jan Veverka, Chris Rogan, Yong Yang, Vladlen Timciuc, Adi Bornheim, and Marat Gataullin, for our work together, discussions, and the times shared in the St. Genis house. Thank you to my students, Josh, Katie, Vishnu, Upa, Jonathan, Jacqueline, and Nicole, for choosing me as your teacher, and rewarding my efforts with your hard work. ivv A search for signatures of extra dimensions in the diphoton invariant-mass spectrum has been performed with the Compact Muon Solenoid detector at the Large Hadron Collider. No excess of events above the standard model expectation is observed using a data sample collected in proton-proton collisions at √ s = 7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2. 2 fb− 1. In the context of the Randall–Sundrum model, lower limits are set on the mass of the first graviton excitation in the range of 0. 86 – 1. 84 TeV, for values of the associated coupling parameter ˜ k between 0. 01 and 0. 10. Additionally, {{in the context of the}} large-extra-dimensions model, lower limits are set on the effective Planck scale in the range of 2. 3 – 3. 8 TeV at the 95 % confidence level. These are the most restrictive bounds to date. vivi...|$|E

50|$|There was a {{constant}} battle, though, as some of our results ran full tilt into my intellectual ideas. In the beginning, I {{took it for granted}} that Seth was a subconscious fantasy, personified, because I simply couldnt accept the possibility of spirits or, for that matter, life after death. Then, after it became obvious that the Seth sessions were going to continue, we kept constant check on <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> characteristics and went to a psychologist - as any sane, red-blooded American would do under such circumstances in those days. Seth seemed far more mature and well-balanced than the psychologist, so finally I stopped worrying. Besides, <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> showed no adverse signs of instability. If anything, I was more competent in handling physical affairs. This is not to say the experience did not cause certain strains and stresses that could accompany any worthwhile venture in an entirely new field.|$|R

Burke, in an interview with Popjustice, elaborated on her experience of working with RedOne. She said,I've got to say, Red was the one who basically got <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> out first. Then everything else slipped into place like a puzzle. Red really started it off for me. He had song already ready for me, right? And then I walked in, and he met me, and he was like, [...] "scrap every song we've just prepared for you, we're going to start from scratch, because you're not the person I thought you would be.'
