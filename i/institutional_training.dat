2500|$|Bourdieu {{insists on}} the {{importance}} of a reflexive sociology in which sociologists must at all times conduct their research with conscious attention to the effects of their own position, their own set of internalized structures, and how these are likely to distort or prejudice their objectivity. The sociologist, according to Bourdieu, must engage in a [...] "sociology of sociology" [...] so as not to unwittingly attribute to the object of observation the characteristics of the subject. She/he ought to conduct their research with one eye continually reflecting back upon their own habitus, their dispositions learned through long social and <b>institutional</b> <b>training.</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempted}} to discover techniques and procedures {{employed in the}} institutional on-farm program for veterans which may be effectively used in training young and adult farmers. This was the first study made of the <b>institutional</b> on-farm <b>training</b> program in Nebraska. The {{data for this study}} were secured from the original Central Region study. Being appointed {{as a member of the}} veterans’ education committee at the fourth annual research conference in Agricultural Education at Purdue University, the author was able to help formulate the questionnaire and set up rules for selecting the kind of schools and number of schools in which the survey would be run. Veterans’ <b>institutional</b> on-farm <b>training</b> classes in fifty schools in Nebraska were used. The basic grouping of the schools selected were: Schools in which at least twenty veterans were enrolled in class. Schools in which the <b>institutional</b> on-farm <b>training</b> class had been in operation at least six months. The schedules used to secure these data were administered by the author, and four other area supervisors from the State Department of Vocational Education in Nebraska. From the completed schedules a random sample of 300 schedules was drawn and the information was transferred to I. B. M. cards. It is very evident that the educational objective to be attained in a course of study should be based upon the needs of the individuals in the class. Over half, 68. 7 percent of all veterans, regardless of age, indicated that the preferred method of choosing farm problems and farm jobs to be taught is to get the experiences, interests, and opinions of the majority of the farmers in the class. The veterans also indicated that the units in a course of study should be based upon the needs of the individuals in the class. They rated the four following units high, indicating them of “much” value in a course of study: Soil conservation, livestock production practices, farm skills (such as castrating), and crop production practices.
