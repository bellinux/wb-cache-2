5000|$|The {{diagnosis}} is less common in some countries, such as China. It {{has been argued}} that the Chinese traditionally deny or somatize emotional depression (although since the early 1980s, the Chinese denial of depression may have modified). Alternatively, it may be that Western cultures reframe and elevate some expressions of human distress to disorder status. Australian professor Gordon Parker and others have argued that the Western concept of depression [...] "medicalizes" [...] sadness or misery. Similarly, Hungarian-American psychiatrist Thomas Szasz and others argue that depression is a metaphorical illness that is inappropriately regarded as an actual disease. There has also been concern that the DSM, as well as the field of descriptive psychiatry that employs it, tends to reify abstract phenomena such as depression, which may in fact be social constructs. American archetypal psychologist James Hillman writes that depression can be healthy for the soul, insofar as [...] "it brings refuge, limitation, focus, <b>gravity,</b> <b>weight,</b> and humble powerlessness." [...] Hillman argues that therapeutic attempts to eliminate depression echo the Christian theme of resurrection, but have the unfortunate effect of demonizing a soulful state of being.|$|E

40|$|Conventionally, {{particle}} size distribution characteristics and consistency limits {{have been used to}} characterize fine-grained soils. However, these schemes of soil characterization are devoid of several other soil-specific parameters (viz., specific surface area, specific <b>gravity,</b> <b>weight</b> loss during heating, heat produced during the interaction of soil with water, chemical and mineralogical composition, zeta potential, cation-exchange capacity, and reactivity) that imbibe in them physical, chemical, mineralogical, and thermal characteristics or, in short, the "overall characteristics" of the soil. These characteristics are also useful to define soils with pollutants and contaminants, which result from rapid and indiscriminate industrialization. Hence, characterization of the soil based on its "heat of wetting," which imbibes the specific characteristics of the soil and is measured by the percentage increase in temperature (PIT) when soil-water interaction occurs, appears to be quite prudent and a novel idea or hypothesis. With this in view and to develop a soil characterization scheme, soils of completely different characteristics were allowed to interact with water in a calorimeter, and the PIT was measured precisely by employing a thermocouple. The PIT and various soil-specific parameters when correlated with each other yielded well-defined relationships. Utility of these relationships for a quick and easy characterization of fine-grained soils has also been demonstrated in this study...|$|E

The experimental period lasted 112 days, during which the zootechnic performance was evaluated through the egg production, feed intake, weight and mass of eggs. The quality of the eggs was valued through their specific <b>gravity,</b> <b>weight</b> and shell thickness, and Haugh unit measurement. The design was entirely randomized, with eight repetitions, and the averages of the treatments were compared by the SNK test (5 %). In the results of performance, the feed intake and egg weight were similar (P 0. 05) under the natural light program. The quality of the eggs was not altered (P< 0. 05) by any of the programs. It was concluded that the intermittent lighting program could be use in open sheds, maintaining the zootechnic performance of semi-heavy laying hens and without altering the quality of their eggs.

40|$|Improvement in feed {{conversion}} efficiency can improve the sustainability of beef cattle production, but genomic selection for feed efficiency affects many underlying molecular networks and physiological traits. This study describes the differences between steer progeny of two influential Angus bulls with divergent genomic predictions for residual feed intake (RFI). Eight steer progeny of each sire were phenotyped for growth and feed intake from 8 mo. of age (average BW 254 kg, with a mean difference between sire groups of 4. 8 kg) until slaughter at 14 - 16 mo. of age (average BW 534 kg, sire group difference of 28. 8 kg). Terminal samples from pituitary gland, skeletal muscle, liver, adipose, and duodenum were collected from each steer for transcriptome sequencing. Gene expression networks were derived using partial correlation and information theory (PCIT), including differentially expressed (DE) genes, tissue specific (TS) genes, transcription factors (TF), and genes associated with RFI from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Relative to progeny of the high RFI sire, progeny of the low RFI sire had - 0. 56 kg/d finishing period RFI (P = 0. 05), - 1. 08 finishing period {{feed conversion}} ratio (P = 0. 01), + 3. 3 kg^ 0. 75 finishing period metabolic mid-weight (MMW; P = 0. 04), + 28. 8 kg final body weight (P = 0. 01), - 12. 9 feed bunk visits per day (P = 0. 02) with + 0. 60 min/visit duration (P = 0. 01), and + 0. 0045 carcass specific <b>gravity</b> (<b>weight</b> in air/weight in air-weight in water, a predictor of carcass fat content; P = 0. 03).

40|$|The Iterative DEsign of Antenna Structures (IDEAS) {{program is}} a finite element {{analysis}} and design optimization program with special features for the analysis and design of microwave antennas and associated sub-structures. As the principal structure analysis and design tool for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Ground Antenna and Facilities Engineering section of NASA's Deep Space Network, IDEAS combines flexibility with easy use. The relatively small bending stiffness {{of the components of}} large, steerable reflector antennas allows IDEAS to use pinjointed (three translational degrees of freedom per joint) models for modeling the gross behavior of these antennas when subjected to static and dynamic loading. This facilitates the formulation of the redesign algorithm which has only one design variable per structural element. Input data deck preparation has been simplified by the use of NAMELIST inputs to promote clarity of data input for problem defining parameters, user selection of execution and design options and output requests, and by the use of many attractive and familiar features of the NASTRAN program (in many cases, NASTRAN and IDEAS formatted bulk data cards are interchangeable). Features such as simulation of a full symmetric structure based on analyses of only half the structure make IDEAS a handy and efficient analysis tool, with many features unavailable in any other finite element analysis program. IDEAS can choose design variables such as areas of rods and thicknesses of plates to minimize total structure weight, constrain the structure weight to a specified value while maximizing a natural frequency or minimizing compliance measures, and can use a stress ratio algorithm to size each structural member so that it is at maximum or minimum stress level for {{at least one of the}} applied loads. Calculations of total structure weight can be broken down according to material. Center of <b>gravity</b> <b>weight</b> balance, static first and second moments about the center of mass and optionally about a user-specified gridpoint, and lumped structure weight at grid points can also be calculated. Other analysis outputs include calculation of reactions, displacements, and element stresses due to specified gravity, thermal, and external applied loads; calculations of linear combinations of specific node displacements (e. g. to represent motions of rigid attachments not included in the structure model), natural frequency eigenvalues and eigenvectors, structure reactions and element stresses, and coordinates of effective modal masses. Cassegrain antenna boresight error analysis of a best fitting paraboloid and Cassegrain microwave antenna root mean square half-pathlength error analysis of a best fitting paraboloid are also performed.
