5|$|Elias Magnus Fries and Christopher Theodor Hök first {{described}} this species as Boletus torosus in 1835, a name {{by which it}} was known for many years. Modern molecular phylogenetics shows {{that it is only}} distantly related to Boletus edulis—the type species of Boletus—and it was duly placed in the new genus Imperator in 2015. Eating raw mushrooms of this species leads to vomiting and diarrhea. Gastrointestinal symptoms have also occurred after eating cooked specimens, though some people have eaten <b>it</b> <b>without</b> ill-effects.|$|E

5000|$|A {{macaroni}} (or formerly maccaroni) in mid-18th-century England was {{a fashionable}} fellow who dressed and even spoke in an outlandishly affected and epicene manner. The term pejoratively {{referred to a}} man who [...] "exceeded the ordinary bounds of fashion" [...] in terms of clothes, fastidious eating, and gambling. He mixed Continental affectations with his English nature, like a practitioner of macaronic verse (which mixed English and Latin to comic effect), laying himself open to satire: There is indeed a kind of animal, neither male nor female, a thing of the neuter gender, lately 1770 started up among us. It is called a macaroni. <b>It</b> talks <b>without</b> meaning, <b>it</b> smiles <b>without</b> pleasantry, <b>it</b> eats <b>without</b> appetite, <b>it</b> rides <b>without</b> exercise, <b>it</b> wenches <b>without</b> passion.|$|R
5|$|Initially, de Peyster {{had been}} {{selected}} to lead {{an assault on the}} breastworks outside the city, however the night before the assault he noticed the city aflame from a signal tower and informed General Weitzel. The men of the corps then entered the city unmolested. Admiral David Farragut later claimed that de Peyster was due as much credit as he would have received had he actually taken the city by storming it, because doing <b>it</b> <b>without</b> bloodshed still carried the same intent.|$|E

5|$|Mamie Till Bradley {{testified that}} she had {{instructed}} her son to watch his manners in Mississippi and that should a situation ever come to his being asked to get on his knees to ask forgiveness of a white person, he should do <b>it</b> <b>without</b> a thought.

5|$|Mary was {{pregnant}} {{when she decided}} to venture out alone on a hunt in a Buda forest on 17May 1395. Her horse tripped, threw her and landed on top of her. The trauma induced labor and she gave birth prematurely to a son. The queen succumbed to the fatal injuries; being far from any kind of assistance, her son died as well. She was buried in the cathedral of Várad (now Oradea in Romania). Mary's sister, Jadwiga, claimed the crown, but Sigismund retained <b>it</b> <b>without</b> much difficulty.|$|E
5|$|Mourning doves can be {{afflicted with}} several {{different}} parasites and diseases, including tapeworms, nematodes, mites, and lice. The mouth-dwelling parasite Trichomonas gallinae is particularly severe. While a mourning dove will sometimes host <b>it</b> <b>without</b> symptoms, it will often cause yellowish {{growth in the}} mouth and esophagus that will eventually starve the host to death. Avian pox is a common, insect-vectored disease.|$|E

5|$|Since its introduction, the Roosevelt dime {{has been}} struck {{continuously}} in large numbers. The Mint transitioned from striking the coin in silver to base metal in 1965, {{and the design}} remains essentially unaltered from when Sinnock created <b>it.</b> <b>Without</b> rare dates or silver content, the dime is less widely sought by coin collectors than other modern U.S. coins.|$|E
5|$|The German {{pilots were}} {{increasingly}} lacking in quantity and quality. Galland recognised this {{but could not}} correct <b>it</b> <b>without</b> stepping outside his own authority. Galland noticed that the highly educated engineers and trainees were selected for the bomber arm in the early war years. Most of the brightest youth were pulled by expert campaigners, toward the Waffen SS and Kriegsmarine. The Luftwaffe did not match this effort.|$|E
5|$|The funeral {{scene at}} the end of the film was also played {{differently}} from what was originally intended. Julie Christie was supposed to wear a veil to hide away her face, but prior to filming Roeg suggested to Christie that she should play <b>it</b> <b>without</b> the veil and smile throughout the scene. Christie was initially sceptical, but Roeg felt it would not make sense for the character to be heartbroken if she believed her husband and daughter were together in the afterlife.|$|E
40|$|Utilitarianism {{continues}} to vex its critics {{even in the}} absence of generally respected arguments in its favour. I suggest that utilitarianism survives largely because of its welfarism. This explains why <b>it</b> survives <b>without</b> the backing of respected arguments. <b>It</b> survives <b>without</b> such arguments because justifying the value of welfare requires no such argument. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{station was}} little used and trains often passed through <b>it</b> <b>without</b> stopping.

The station building survives today and is close to Down Street's junction with Piccadilly. Part of it is now converted to a retail outlet.|$|E

During a school trip, the youngsters find an alien in distress and have to help <b>it</b> <b>without</b> revealing its presence {{to the rest of}} their friends.

5|$|A {{company from}} the 2/28th Battalion {{captured}} Victoria shortly after coming ashore, and the battalion first met opposition at Flagstaff Hill at 10:45 am. One of the battalion's companies subsequently captured the hill, while its other companies continued to advance. The 2/28th Battalion encountered increasing opposition {{as the day}} progressed, particularly {{to the west of}} its area of responsibility. During the afternoon of 10 June the battalion engaged Japanese troops in the area west of Flagstaff Hill (at the junction of Callaghan and MacArthur Roads), with the infantrymen being supported by tanks and mortars; the Australians counted 18 Japanese dead {{by the end of the}} day, and suffered several fatalities and men wounded in this fighting. After civilians reported that no Japanese were stationed on the Hamilton peninsula which formed the western side of Victoria Harbour, a troop from the 2/11th Commando Squadron was landed in the area during 10 June and secured <b>it</b> <b>without</b> opposition.|$|E
5|$|According to Sundaram Balachander's wife Shanta Balachander, the {{director}} had watched Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950) at a film festival, {{was inspired by}} it, and wrote a play in the same narrative style, but the script was rejected by All India Radio. Balachander later approached A. V. Meiyappan, the founder of AVM Productions, and narrated the story for him. Although Meiyappan agreed to produce the story as a film, he was unconvinced with Balachander's idea of making <b>it</b> <b>without</b> songs or stunts; however, he agreed to finance the project because he liked the story and trusted Balachander's talent. Andha Naal thus became the first Tamil film {{that did not have}} any songs or dance sequences, and was the only film directed by Balachander for AVM Productions.|$|E
