Nobel laureate Gary Becker said that Progress and Poverty was the first economics book he read, because Henry George [...] "was famous in those days" [...] and [...] "influenced a lot of us in economics." [...] Becker also said that the book was wonderful and had a lasting <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>thinking.</b> Ilya Tolstoy said that the book was a revelation to his father.|$|E

5000|$|English {{was born}} in Bicester, Oxfordshire in 1941, {{the son of an}} RAF flying officer. His early {{childhood}} was spent moving around England with long holidays spent in the South West of Ireland where his mother came from. Throughout his childhood, he developed a fascination with drawing, often technical subjects such as aeroplanes and trains both of which remained a fascination throughout his life. His 'Machine Paintings' in the late 1970s and 1980s are a testament to this. In 1962 he entered Ealing College of Art where he took Roy Ascott's radical Groundcourse which had a major <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>thinking.</b> His work included commissioned paintings for both private individuals and public organisations, advertising art for companies such as Porsche and stamp series for the Royal Mail such as the 'British Buses' or 'British Motorcycles' [...] He lived in London with his wife, Jaki, and continued to work right up until his death in 2009 following a long illness.|$|E

40|$|Calvin as “practical theologian”: the {{contribution}} of a theodramatic paradigm In order {{to ask the question}} about the role and place of a specific discipline (in this case Practical Theology), one must realise where one comes from. This article seeks to answer the question about the role of Practical Theology within the field of theology in conversation with some perspectives offered by the sixteenth-century reformer, John Calvin. It is argued that Calvin lived in a century that scholars regard as one of the golden periods in which the world of the arts and theatre flourished. Hence Calvin’s age was characterised by a dramatic vision of human existence and such a vision also had an <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own theological <b>thinking.</b> Against this backdrop, the article engages the question of the role and place of practical theology by proposing a theodramatic approach in which the possibilities that the notion of “re-dramatisation” holds, come to the fore. </p...|$|R
5000|$|His {{father had}} plans {{for him and}} {{directing}} him to the accounting profession which he studied for. He obtained his high school diploma to enter accounting but this was something cut short in 1930 when he suffered from a chronic and debilitating stomach ailment that forced him to quit. He began to work in his father's tailor shop and inherited it after his death and so made this the focus of his life alongside his mother who aided him. When he assumed tailoring his stress reduced {{and he seemed to}} become much happier and active in his parish. He liked to be a loner and kept to himself and never married nor had children; he liked taking photos as well as gardening and had an avid interest in science and foreign languages. In 1935 he attended Mass and listened to a sermon a Salesian priest gave that would forever change his life and broaden his spiritual horizons. The priest said in the sermon that [...] "it is not difficult to become a saint" [...] and this had a profound <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own <b>thinking</b> <b>on</b> {{what it meant to be}} a saint and aspire for personal holiness. He became an ardent admirer and devotee to Saint John of the Cross and Saint Teresa of Ávila after reading their spiritual writings and he soon became enthralled with the Carmelite charism despite never joining them as a religious or secular member.|$|R
50|$|Born in 1949, Hugh Merrill {{was raised}} in Washington, D.C. and Alabama. His grandfather, Hugh Davis Merrill, was a state judge and Lieutenant Governor of Alabama. His father worked with the Democratic Party, advising Kennedy, Humphrey and Johnson on {{agricultural}} issues. Merrill began his artistic career in 1969 at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA). Within his first year, Merrill flunked out {{and ended up in}} Washington D.C., working in the offices of Alabama senator John Sparkman. The following year he returned to MICA, where he discovered printmaking, specifically etching, a medium that would become his primary means of expression for the next four decades. Despite continued academic difficulties, Merrill completed his undergraduate work and was accepted to Yale School of Art. There, he studied with John Cage, Gabor Pederti, William Bailey, Alex Katz, Robert Motherwell, Al Held and others, all of whom would have a profound <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>thinking</b> and work. After receiving his MFA from Yale in 1975, Merrill taught at Wheaton College (Massachusetts) before being hired to teach printmaking at the Kansas City Art Institute (KCAI) in 1976, where he has been teaching since.|$|E

500|$|Amongst British composers, Sir Harrison Birtwistle readily {{acknowledges}} {{the influence of}} Stockhausen's Zeitmaße (especially <b>on</b> <b>his</b> two wind quintets, Refrains and Choruses and Five Distances) and Gruppen <b>on</b> <b>his</b> work more generally ( [...] ; [...] ). Brian Ferneyhough says that, although the [...] "technical and speculative innovations" [...] of Klavierstücke I–IV, Kreuzspiel and Kontra-Punkte escaped him on first encounter , they nevertheless produced a [...] "sharp emotion, {{the result of a}} beneficial shock engendered by their boldness" [...] and provided [...] "an important source of motivation (rather than of imitation) for my own investigations" [...] While still in school, he became fascinated upon hearing the British première of Gruppen, and listened many times to the recording of this performance, while trying to penetrate its secrets—how it always seemed to be about to explode, but managed nevertheless to escape unscathed in its core—but scarcely managed to grasp it. Retrospectively, it is clear that from this confusion was born my interest for the formal questions which remain until today. [...] With respect to Stockhausen's later work, he said, I have never subscribed (whatever the inevitable personal distance) to the thesis according to which the many transformations of vocabulary characterizing Stockhausen's development are the obvious sign of his inability to carry out the early vision of strict order that he had in <b>his</b> youth. <b>On</b> the contrary, {{it seems to me that}} the constant reconsideration of his premises has led to the maintenance of a remarkably tough thread of historical consciousness which will become clearer with time[...] [...] [...] I doubt that there has been a single composer of the intervening generation who, even if for a short time, did not see the world of music differently thanks to the work of Stockhausen. [...] In a short essay describing Stockhausen's influence <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own work, Richard Barrett concludes that [...] "Stockhausen remains the composer whose next work I look forward most to hearing, apart from myself of course" [...] and names as works that have had particular <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> musical <b>thinking</b> Mantra, Gruppen, Carré, Klavierstück X, Inori, and Jubiläum [...]|$|R
