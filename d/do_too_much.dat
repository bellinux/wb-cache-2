25|$|SGML found wide {{acceptance}} and use in fields with very large-scale documentation requirements. However, many found it cumbersome {{and difficult to}} learn—a side effect of its design attempting to <b>do</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> and be too flexible. For example, SGML made end tags (or start-tags, or even both) optional in certain contexts, because its developers thought markup would be done manually by overworked support staff who would appreciate saving keystrokes.|$|E

He was {{successful}} in the early county matches and took 4 for 70 when he {{was included in the}} team for the Second Test at Lord's, including the wickets of Ted Dexter and Ken Barrington, both caught behind off successive balls. However, he was being asked to <b>do</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> bowling and succumbed to injury after the Third Test, in which he again dismissed Barrington cheaply. He took no further part in the tour.|$|E

25|$|Following {{his second}} tour in Iraq, Petraeus {{authored}} a widely read article in Military Review, listing fourteen observations {{he had made}} during two tours in Iraq, including: do not <b>do</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> with your own hands, money is ammunition, {{increasing the number of}} stakeholders is critical to success, success in a counterinsurgency requires more than just military operations, ultimate success depends on local leaders, {{there is no substitute for}} flexible and adaptable leaders, and, finally, a leader's most important task is to set the right tone.|$|E
500|$|The {{first episode}} of the season premiered in Los Angeles on September 23, 2015, with the season, {{consisting}} of 22 episodes, airing on ABC beginning on September 29, 2015 until May 17, 2016. The premiere was watched by 4.90 million viewers, higher than any {{episode of the}} entire second half of season two. Overall, the season had generally consistent ratings, and received positive reviews; critics felt the series had 'hit its stride' with the season, and particularly praised the risky bottle episode [...] "4,722 Hours", though the pacing of the season received criticism for trying to <b>do</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> at times. The series was renewed for a fourth season on March 3, 2016.|$|E
500|$|On 1 October 2009, Shearer was {{commissioned}} as Deputy Lieutenant of Northumberland, having been nominated by the Duchess of Northumberland in her capacity as Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland, and approved {{for the position}} by the Queen. In this role, Shearer, along with 21 other deputies, is the stand-in for the Duchess when she cannot fulfill her role as the Queen's official representative in the region at official engagements. Deputies must live within seven miles of the county boundaries, and retain their appointment until age 75. The Duchess said of the appointment that [...] "You {{could not find a}} more iconic person than Alan, not just for what he has done in football but for all the extra work he tirelessly does for charity and communities. I am delighted he has accepted the role of Deputy Lieutenant because he is a real role model.

500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} mixed, or simply {{referred}} to the episode as [...] "decent". Jill Mader from InsidePulse called the episode [...] "decent" [...] noting that [...] " [...] season has been shaping up." [...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic noted that the episode was not a [...] "fantastic episode of The Office, but it had its funny moments, and that's what I tune in for." [...] The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt wrote [...] "Doomsday" [...] was not [...] "a terrible episode by any means [...] the various pieces never fell into place, and the resolution didn't feel {{as though it was}} earned by the episode that came before it. It just felt like it was trying to <b>do</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> too quickly, never quite narrowing in on character in the midst of manufacturing chaos." [...] McNutt ultimately gave the episode a B-. Despite some of the more mixed reviews, a large majority of critics found the cold-opening humorous, with many noting that it was the best of the season so far.|$|E
500|$|Unemployment bred labour militancy. In December 1930, Brownlee asked John Lymburn, his attorney-general, {{to prepare}} a list of known Communist leaders so he could arrange for their {{deportation}} where possible. [...] He staunchly opposed the activities of organizations that he viewed as communist, including the Ukrainian Labour Farmer Temple Association and the Farmers' Unity League. [...] In December 1932, labour organizers staged a [...] "Hunger March", at which 1,000 unemployed met in Edmonton's Market Square and marched to the legislature building. [...] Brownlee refused to grant permission for the march and requested and received police assistance in breaking it up. [...] While he pronounced himself willing {{to meet with a}} delegation of the march's leaders, he believed that the atmosphere at the march would be dangerously volatile and refused to address it. [...] One participant said [...] "A lot of us understood that [...] couldn't <b>do</b> <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> but we figured since it's a farmers' government, least he can do is come out and explain. [...] But they wouldn't let us near the Parliament Building." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening {{number of}} the {{black-and-white}} [...] "special", [...] "Let It Snow" [...] featuring Blaine and Kurt, garnered the most praise. Slezak gave it an [...] "A" [...] and {{described it as a}} [...] "jazzy, uptempo take on the seasonal classic with gorgeous harmonies and retro dancing", and said it rivaled their Christmas duet from 2010, [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside". While Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger enjoyed the number, she preferred the previous year's offering; Flandez called [...] "Let It Snow" [...] an [...] "admirable job". Futterman characterized it as [...] "both effortless and full of seasonal spirit", and Votta said it was [...] "a spot-on tribute to male duets of yesteryear with that knowing undercurrent of romance even when it's not explicit". Chaney gave it an [...] "A", but she wondered at the inclusion of the next song, [...] "My Favorite Things", since it [...] "technically isn't a holiday song". The number was also not as well received as many of the others: Bell described it as taking [...] "a turn for the worse", Hyman noted that it [...] "didn't <b>do</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for me", and Kubicek said it [...] "seemed to drag {{on and on and on}} with no real purpose". However, West called it a [...] "wonderful effort" [...] and Slezak wrote that [...] "a little Rodgers and Hammerstein is always welcome at any party"; both reviewers gave the performance a [...] "B+".|$|E

A skinhead that told Davis to [...] "go back to Bakersfield" [...] attempted to hit Davis but he dodged and the band's road manager, Jeff, knocked the skinhead out. [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] was about Davis' drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him {{at the height of}} his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare, as if he cannot help himself. Davis explained: [...] "I'd wake up in the morning and do a line to get out of bed. Speed in the morning, I'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay down and go to sleep, I'd wake up and just snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad. It's like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to do the next day so you have to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done. Eventually you start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that." [...] Davis said that [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] "is about meth. It's about when you do meth and you look down at your dick and it's literally a helmet in the bush [...] ". [...] "Basically it's what happens when you <b>do</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> drugs and your girl wanna get with you and you got some man problems down below. Just another reason not to do drugs, children," [...] Fieldy elaborated.|$|E
2500|$|Initial reviews {{immediately}} following the film's debut at the Edinburgh International Film Festival were generally positive. The performances of the two leads, Mullan and Lowden, were widely praised. A few reviewers felt that the film may have tried to <b>do</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> due to having several themes, and a few felt {{that some of the}} golfing sequences were repetitive.|$|E
2500|$|Led Zeppelin IV {{received}} overwhelming {{praise from}} critics.

2500|$|Game Revolution's Johnny Liu {{awarded the}} game a C. He was {{critical}} of the core platformer gameplay; [...] "the platform events come off as a standard, undisguised item hunt." [...] Of the graphics, he wrote [...] "the quality varies. Outdoor environments are doused in an over-saturated color palette, though the frame rate is smooth enough. The detail work {{in some of the}} interior dungeons offers some sharper textures and compelling lighting effects." [...] He concluded [...] "Though it's admirably ambitious, Haven is crippled by trying to <b>do</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> Instead of simply having these separate parts strung together, it would have worked better had the game allowed you to switch from any of these game styles at will." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ewbank's {{coaching}} {{style was}} laid-back but efficient, combining his mild personality with an orderliness inherited from Paul Brown. [...] "Weeb combined a low-key style with {{a flair for}} the most dramatic of accomplishments", former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in 1998. [...] "He led two of the legendary teams during the era of pro football's greatest growth. But he preferred {{to stay in the}} background and let the players take the credit." [...] He favored well-practiced execution of a limited number of plays over complicated offensive and defensive systems. Paul Brown [...] "had the exact same approach: Don't <b>do</b> <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> but what you do, execute it flawlessly", Raymond Berry said in 2013, adding that the Colts' 1958 championship team had only six passing plays.|$|E
2500|$|Climate {{engineering}} {{opens up}} various {{political and economic}} issues. The governance issues characterizing carbon dioxide removal compared to solar radiation management tend to be distinct. Carbon dioxide removal techniques are typically slow to act, expensive, and entail risks that are relatively familiar, such as the risk of carbon dioxide leakage from underground storage formations. In contrast, solar radiation management methods are fast-acting, comparatively cheap, and involve novel and more significant risks such as regional climate disruptions. As {{a result of these}} differing characteristics, the key governance problem for carbon dioxide removal (as with emissions reductions) is making sure actors do enough of it (the so-called [...] "free rider problem"), whereas the key governance issue for solar radiation management is making sure actors do not <b>do</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> (the [...] "free driver" [...] problem).|$|E

2500|$|In {{his review}} in the New York Times, Bosley Crowther wrote that the film [...] "has been so sharply reduced in scope {{from what it was}} in the novel and the {{backgrounds}} of its people have been so pruned that it fails to explain the whys of their troubles, into the middle of which we're suddenly thrown. This appears to be the fault of the writer-director, Philip Dunne. He has tried to <b>do</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> with visual shorthand [...] [...] [...] He barely introduces his hero [...] [...] [...] before he is bouncing us through three disappointments in the fellow's fifty-first year and then having him meet a beautiful model for a brief and futile fling at romance [...] [...] [...] The production has class and distinction in black-and-white CinemaScope, but the drama itself lacks those virtues." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barbed wire was cut, the German fortifications [...] "exceptionally" [...] {{damaged and}} a crude form of {{creeping}} barrage preceded the infantry to their objectives. Harris held Haig {{responsible for the}} extension of the objectives in the north to the German second position, which diluted the density of British artillery-fire, although because no study had been made of the details of the preliminary bombardment, caution must accompany a conclusion that bombardment of the closer objectives was unduly dissipated. Harris concluded that the attack front was too broad and that Rawlinson should be held responsible with Haig, for attempting to advance on a [...] front. Despite being under no diplomatic pressure from the French or political pressure from London to obtain swift success, the British tried to <b>do</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> too quickly, unlike the French Sixth Army which made short advances with the support of massive amounts of artillery-fire.|$|E
2500|$|The series {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television sources and critics. One review from Brian Lowry of Variety explained {{it contains a}} [...] "kind of crazed energy and inventiveness that isn't associated often enough with girl-oriented children's fare [...] opts for a more elevated approach– like that aforementioned roller-coaster jaunt, taking a free-spirited jump off the tracks and trusting its audience to hang on for the ride." [...] David Hinckley of Daily News gave the show four stars, while writing that The Mighty B! [...] "has a decent shot at becoming a pre-tween fave." [...] Aaron H. Bynum of Animation Insider called the series a [...] "good, brainless cartoon [...] viewers shouldn't ever be bored with Bessie," [...] but criticized part of its humor for not [...] "try to <b>do</b> <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> which may ultimately work against it when the story calls for the characters to do too little.|$|E
