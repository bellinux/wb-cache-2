5|$|In modern Polish historiography the battle's {{outcome is}} seen as a victory, if a very costly one, for the Polish and Soviet troops. As noted by historians such as Wawer and Komorowski, despite the heavy casualties, the Polish–Soviet <b>frontline</b> was not seriously breached, and thus the German {{offensive}} was a failure.|$|E
5|$|The British Expeditionary Force or BEF {{arrived in}} Calais {{on its way}} to the nearby <b>frontline</b> cutting through Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Flanders. Calais was a key port for the supply of arms and {{reinforcements}} to the Western Front. In the 1930s, the town was known for being a politically socialist stronghold.|$|E

5|$|Toshack then bowled Pollard and Bradman caught Young from Johnston's bowling as England were {{dismissed}} for 363. Compton was unbeaten on 145 after 324 minutes of batting, having struck 16 fours. Lindwall took 4/99 and Johnston 3/67. Miller did not bowl, so the four remaining <b>frontline</b> bowlers sent down {{no less than}} 38 overs each.|$|E
5|$|A batting all-rounder, Loxton {{played as}} a {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast medium bowler who reinforced the <b>frontline</b> pace attack of Lindwall, Miller and Bill Johnston. When fit, the trio all bowled before Loxton in the Tests. With medium pacer Ernie Toshack and off spinner Ian Johnson also {{playing in the}} Third and Fourth Tests, Loxton was the sixth bowler. In the Fifth Test, Johnson was replaced by leg spinner Ring and the injured Toshack {{was replaced by a}} batsman, so Loxton became the fifth bowler. Of the seven regular bowlers, Loxton {{was the only one who}} was not a <b>frontline</b> bowler, and as such he had the worst average, the second-worst economy rate and the third-worst strike rate. Loxton ended the Test series with 144 runs at 48.00 and three wickets at 49.33, having bowled 63 overs. Loxton batted at No.6 or No.7 during the Tests, and was the last batsman in the batting order before the wicket-keeper and the bowlers.|$|E
