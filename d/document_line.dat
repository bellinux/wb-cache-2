50|$|In computing, a {{line editor}} is a text editor {{in which each}} editing command applies {{to one or more}} {{complete}} lines of text designated by the user. Line editors predate screen-based text editors and originated in an era when a computer operator typically interacted with a teleprinter (essentially a printer with a keyboard), with no video display, and no ability to move a cursor interactively within a <b>document.</b> <b>Line</b> editors were also a feature of many home computers, avoiding the need for a more memory-intensive full-screen editor.|$|E

The algorithm {{is based on a}} wavelet transform of the horizontal projective profile of the document image. The projective profile is examined as a one-dimensional discrete signal which is decomposed using the pyramidal wavelet algorithm up to a precise scale, where local minima and maxima are discovered. These local extrema, projected into the input signal, correspond to the spacing between document lines and to the pivots of the lines. The method has been tested on a broad set of printed and handwritten documents and proven to be stable and efficient...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{document}} understanding {{system in which}} the arrangement of lines of text and block separators within a document are modeled by stochastic context free gram-mars. A grammar corresponds to a document genre; our system may be adapted to a new genre simply by replac-ing the input grammar. The system incorporates an opti-cal character recognition system that outputs characters, their positions and font sizes. These features are combined to form a <b>document</b> representation of <b>lines</b> of text and sepa-rators. Lines of text are labeled as tokens using regular ex-pression matching. The maximum likelihood parse of this stream of tokens and separators yields a functional label-ing of the <b>document</b> <b>lines.</b> We describe business card and business letter applications. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper proposes SVM+BiHMM, {{a hybrid}} {{statistic}} model of metadata extraction based on SVM (support vector machine) and BiHMM (bigram HMM (hidden Markov model)). The BiHMM model modifies the HMM model with both Bigram sequential relation and position information of words, {{by means of}} distinguishing the beginning emitting probability from the inner emitting probability. First, the rule based extractor segments documents into line-blocks. Second, the SVM classifier tags the blocks into metadata elements. Finally, the SVM+BiHMM model {{is built based on}} the BiHMM model, with the emitting probability adjusted by the Sigmoid function of SVM score, and the transition probability trained by Bigram HMM. The SVM classifier benefits from the structure patterns of <b>document</b> <b>line</b> data while the Bigram HMM considers both words ’ Bigram sequential relation and position information, so the complementary SVM+BiHMM outperforms HMM, BiHMM, and SVM methods in the experiments on the same task. Key words: metadata extraction; rule based information extraction; SVM (support vector machine); HM...|$|E

Recently CCM {{images have}} shown a great {{potential}} to be a non-invasive and hence reiterative surrogate for accurate and reliable detection and quantification of human diabetic neuropathy. This paper presents a compar-ison between two methods to detect the nerves fibres in the CCM images: a well <b>documented</b> <b>line</b> operator (Linop) and a method based on Gabor filtering. The evaluation of the extraction is measured according to ground truth data that has been manually extracted. The Gabor filtering method has achieved a reduction of 11. 82 % in the overall EER of the Linop method at the best operation points. ...|$|R

Malayalam Character recognition is a complex task {{because of the presence of}} two scripts; old script and new script and a lot of combinational characters. Initially, the image is preprocessed to remove noise. Then skew correction methods are applied to the <b>document.</b> <b>Lines,</b> words and characters are segmented from the processed document image.

The source data for this thesis are the full Extensible Markup Language (XML) texts of A Standard Corpus of Present Day Edited American English. The first step is transforming these XML files to produce a term-document matrix, including stop word removal, stemming, tf-idf (term frequency–inverse document frequency) weighting, global filtering; here rows of this matrix represent documents as n-dimensional vectors. Secondly, these vectors are clustered and visualized by SOM consisting of neurons, each neuron relatives {{to a set of}} documents with a certain number of same terms.
