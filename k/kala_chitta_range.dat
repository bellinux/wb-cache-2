40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to assess, record and report the ethnobotanical {{potential}} of the <b>Kala</b> <b>Chitta</b> Hills (salt <b>range)</b> of District Attock. Results of the present investigation were based on medicinally important 40 species (21 families). These plant species has other benefits too along with their major utilities like apiculture, sericulture, food and fruits. The <b>Kala</b> <b>Chitta</b> Hills of the Salt Range are very unique. Due to increase in population masses, demands of people increases, causing great pressure on {{the products of the}} area. This continuous pressure for last few decades has disastrously damaged the natural characteristic ecosystem of the area. The region is very rich in having medicinal plants. To understand the indigenous knowledge of the local people through ethnomedicinal study is very important for creating awareness among them regarding sustainable natural resource management. About 100 informants including local people, hakims and medicinal businessmen were interviewed for collection of ethnomedicinal data through the questionnaire. Results were compiled, issues were discussed, conclusion was made and recommendations are suggested for the future...|$|R
40|$|Marine {{sedimentary}} sections {{across the}} Paleocene/Eocene (P/E) boundary interval are {{preserved in the}} Patala Formation (Upper Indus Basin) and Dungan Formation (Lower Indus Basin), Pakistan. The P/E interval of the Patala Formation is composed of limestone and shale inter-beds indicating deposition on a carbonate platform. The analysis of larger foraminifera across the P/E interval from the Patala Formation (<b>Kala</b> <b>Chitta</b> <b>Ranges),</b> allows {{the recognition of the}} Larger Foraminiferal Turnover (LFT). The Larger Foraminiferal Turnover (LFT) observed in the Patala Formation is associated with the PETM (Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum) global climatic event and allows the recognition of the P/E boundary in shallow water carbonates of the Indus Basin. This turnover is already reported from other Tethyan sections and from the Salt Range (Upper Indus Basin), Pakistan. The recognition of the LFT allows the inter-basinal and intra-basinal correlation of the P/E interval of the shallow carbonates of the Indus Basin, Pakistan. The available literature on the Paleocene-Eocene Patala and Dungan formations is used to review the planktonic foraminiferal biostratigraphy of the P/E interval. The planktonic foraminiferal zones in the P/E interval of the Indus Basin are identified and reviewed in the light of new international zonations. The planktonic foraminiferal content of the Dungan Formation allows its correlation with the Laki Formation of Rajesthan (India). Four dinoflagellate zones in the P/E interval of the Rakhi Nala section (Lower Indus Basin) are identified and correlated with international and regional zonations. The quantitative analysis of the dinoflagellate cyst assemblages together with geochemical data (i. e., carbon isotopes (organic only), C/N ratio, TOC, carbonate content) is used to reconstruct the palaeoenivronment across the P/E interval. The dinocyst assemblages in general, and the abundance of Apectodinium spp. in particular, indicate the warmer surface water conditions of the global PETM event. The dinocyst assemblages allow the local correlation of the Dungan Formation (part) of the Sulaiman Range with the Patala Formation (part) of the Upper Indus Basin and global correlation of the Zone Pak-DV with the Apectodinium acme Zone of the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The carbon isotopic excursion (CIE) associated with PETM is now globally used to identify the P/E boundary. The CIE in total organic carbon (i. e., δ 13 CTOC = - 28. 9 ‰) and total fine fraction organics (i. e., δ 13 CFF= 26. 4 ‰) from the Indus Basin is reported for the first time. This CIE record from the Indus Basin is compared with other Tethyan sections from Egypt and Uzbekistan and is also compared with the global sections from USA (Northern hemisphere) and from New Zealand (Southern hemisphere).

40|$|Abstract: The Main Boundary Thrust {{in northwestern}} Pakistan is a floor thrust along which a thrust system {{incorporating}} Precambrian and Phanerozoic rocks of the <b>Kala</b> <b>Chitta</b> and Attock-Cherat <b>Ranges</b> was emplaced over Cenozoic strata {{of the northern}} Kohat and Potwar Plateaus. The MBT and successive thrusts toward the foreland are interpreted as low angle to fiat decollement thrusts at 8 - 10 km depths that bound thrust sheets with large lateral dimensions. Admissible cross sections indicate over 60 km of shortening along the largely pre-Palaeocene Khairabad, Cherat, and Hissartang thrusts within the MBT allochthon. In the toe of the MBT allochthon, contraction ismanifest at the surface as tight folds in largely Mesozoic and lower Tertiary strata, decoupled in the upper third of the allochthon. Displacement of the MBT is estimated at over 40 km {{and south of the}} MBT, shortening is interpreted along blind thrusts accompanied by shallow (0 - 3 km deep) backthrusting. The MBT allochthon was deformed prior to its low angle displacement over the northern Kohat and Potwar Plateaus, and folded and eroded during or after its emplacement. The MBT thrust front may participate in its own later deformation, but not as an emergent low angle thrust hrough the Quaternary...|$|R

Compared to pakicetid teeth {{found at the}} same locality, the P3 of Attockicetus is much lower, angled anteriorly, and has a very long posterior extension. A long diastema separates P3 from P4 and P3 is longer than P4, which Cooper et al. identified as a remingtonocetid character and, because Attockicetus is the only known remingtonocetid known from the <b>Kala</b> <b>Chitta</b> Hills, they tentatively assigned the specimen as belonging to this genus. The P4 of Attockicetus is {{similar to those of}} Pakicetus in retaining a tall protoconid (cusp) and anterior and posterior basal extensions with prominent cristae (crests), but differs from them in having steeper protoconid slopes, being taller, and having longer basal extensions. Cooper et al. also noted that the molar wear in pakicetids is typically extensive, whilst the P4 in Attockicetus is less worn, suggesting that the latter was not used for breaking down food, but for holding prey.|$|R
30|$|The Datta Formation is {{of early}} Jurassic age, {{and it is}} well {{developed}} in the Trans-Indus Ranges and the Salt Range (Dalnichik 1961; Dalnichik and Shah 1967). The formation consists of variegated sandstone, with shale, siltstone, and mudstone (Shah 1977). It extends as a tongue into <b>Kala</b> <b>Chitta,</b> Hazara {{and part of the}} Kohat area (Shah 1977). The Datta Formation has disconformable lower contact with the Kingriali Formation, and the upper contact with the Shinawri Formation is gradational. In the Kohat area, the formation is reported to be composed of quartzose, dolomitic, and oolitic limestone, suggesting a shallow marine shoreline with the development of a supratidal flat (Fatmi et al. 1990). The age is of Datta Formation is reported as early Jurassic (pre-Toarcian) (Shah 2009). The Jurassic system in Pakistan characterizes mainly limestones, shale, and sandstone. The lower part of the early Jurassic (Datta Formation) is composed of arenaceous and argillaceous sediments dominantly continental origin, grading upward in a sequence of marine calcareous/argillaceous rocks of Shinawri formation. The marine transgression in the Kohat–Potwar depositional basin is suggested to have occurred during late early Jurassic (Shah 2009). The siliciclastic sequence of Datta represents autocyclic sedimentation sequence caused due to environmental and depositional system fluctuations such as river avulsion, delta-lobe switching, and tidal channel migration.|$|R
