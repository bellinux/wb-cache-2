She launches her own campaign to rival Cook, but finds that most of her classmates' support is for Cook's anarchist ideas.

She flees to Kieran for comfort but leaves him, shocked and disgusted, when he kisses her. She goes home and, after finding a note from Emily in <b>her</b> <b>bed,</b> cries herself to sleep.|$|E
5|$|After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose {{return to}} the boat deck. The {{lifeboats}} have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel only buoyant enough for one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in <b>her</b> <b>bed.</b> Jack dies of hypothermia but Rose is saved.|$|E
5|$|Back in the present, Lovett {{decides to}} abandon his search after hearing Rose's story.

5|$|Chaucer's Criseyde is {{swayed by}} Diomedes playing on her fear. Pandarus is now her uncle, more worldly-wise and {{more active in}} what happens and so Troilus is more passive. This {{passivity}} is given comic treatment when Troilus passes out in Criseyde's bedroom and is lifted into <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> by Pandarus. Troilus' repeated emotional paralysis is {{comparable to that of}} Hamlet who may have been based on him. It can be seen as driven by loyalty both to Criseyde and to his homeland, but has also been interpreted less kindly.|$|E

He had shot Nevill in the bedroom too, but Nevill was able to get downstairs where he and Bamber fought in the kitchen, before Bamber shot him four times, twice in his temple and twice into the top of his head. He had shot Sheila in the main bedroom, next to her mother, and had shot the children in their beds as they slept.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the fire was under control, the house was almost totally destroyed, leaving behind only the garage and some front stonework. The fire had spread rapidly, and {{although}} high winds contributed to the intensity, authorities deemed {{the speed with which}} the house had become fully involved suspicious enough to bring in arson investigators. The bodies of Tim and Kelly were not recovered until the following morning, when the house had cooled enough to permit safe searching. Kelly had perished in <b>her</b> <b>bed,</b> most likely of smoke inhalation. Tim's body was found on the ground floor, near the kitchen. Investigators at first assumed he had died trying to escape, but later determined that he had perished in or near his bedroom, most likely of smoke inhalation and heat, and that his body had fallen through burned flooring to where it was discovered.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{looked to}} further Valois {{interests}} by grand dynastic marriages. In 1570, Charles IX married Elisabeth of Austria, daughter of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. Catherine was also {{eager for a}} match between one of her two youngest sons and Elizabeth I of England. After Catherine's daughter Elisabeth died in childbirth in 1568, she had touted her youngest daughter Margaret as a bride for Philip II of Spain. Now she sought a marriage between Margaret and Henry III of Navarre, Jeanne' son, {{with the aim of}} uniting Valois and Bourbon interests. Margaret, however, was secretly involved with Henry of Guise, the son of the late Duke of Guise. When Catherine found this out, she had her daughter brought from <b>her</b> <b>bed.</b> Catherine and the king then beat her, ripping her nightclothes and pulling out handfuls of her hair.|$|E

5|$|Ravana fights {{the final}} duel with Rama. Rama fails to kill Ravana with his {{ordinary}} arrows, but finally kills with a magical arrow. While Valmiki's Ramayana narrates that the magical arrow {{was given to}} Rama by Indra, in other versions the magical arrow is hidden in Mandodari's bed chambers or under <b>her</b> <b>bed.</b> While Mandodari is engrossed in worshipping the goddess Parvati for Ravana's wellbeing, Hanuman comes to her disguised as a Brahmin. After winning her confidence, he tricks her into revealing the secret location of the arrow. Hanuman seizes the arrow and gives it to Rama, leading to Ravana's end. Mandodari appears at the death scene of Ravana in a disarrayed state and laments his death. In this battle, Mandodari loses her husband, her sons, and her kinsmen.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on January 4, 1974—around {{the time that}} he {{terminated}} his relationship with Brooks—Bundy entered the basement apartment of 18-year-old Karen Sparks (identified as Joni Lenz, Mary Adams or Terri Caldwell by various sources), a dancer and student at UW. After bludgeoning the sleeping woman senseless with a metal rod from <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> frame, he sexually assaulted her with either the same rod, or a metal speculum, causing extensive internal injuries. She remained unconscious for 10 days, but survived with permanent disabilities. Less than a month later, {{in the early morning hours}} of February 1, Bundy broke into the basement room of Lynda Ann Healy, a UW undergraduate who broadcast morning radio weather reports for skiers. He beat her unconscious, dressed her in blue jeans, a white blouse, and boots, and carried her away.|$|E
5|$|The Rokeby Venus {{depicts the}} Roman goddess of love, beauty and {{fertility}} reclining languidly on <b>her</b> <b>bed,</b> {{her back to}} the viewer—in Antiquity, portrayal of Venus from a back view was a common visual and literary erotic motif—and her knees tucked. She is shown without the mythological paraphernalia normally included in depictions of the scene; jewellery, roses, and myrtle are all absent. Unlike most earlier portrayals of the goddess, which show her with blond hair, Velázquez's Venus is a brunette. The female figure can be identified as Venus {{because of the presence of}} her son, Cupid.|$|E

Maggie hated blame; she had been blamed all her life, and nothing had come of it but evil tempers.|$|R
