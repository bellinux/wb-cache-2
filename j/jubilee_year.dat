The opera was revived in London {{in the summer of}} 1947. It was then included in the D'Oyly Carte repertory in every season from then on, until the company's closure in 1982.

25|$|The biblical rules {{concerning}} Sabbatical years (shmita) {{are still}} observed by many religious Jews in Israel, but the regulations for the <b>Jubilee</b> <b>year</b> {{have not been}} observed for many centuries.
