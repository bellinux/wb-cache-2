5|$|Feathers are a <b>feature</b> <b>characteristic</b> {{of birds}} (though {{also present in}} some dinosaurs not {{currently}} considered to be true birds). They facilitate flight, provide insulation that aids in thermoregulation, and are used in display, camouflage, and signalling. There are several types of feathers, each serving {{its own set of}} purposes. Feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pterylae. The distribution pattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and systematics. The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body, called plumage, may vary within species by age, social status, and sex.|$|E

2500|$|Twenty-five motets by La Rue survive. [...] They {{are mostly}} for four voices. [...] While they use imitation, the {{technique}} {{is more likely to}} occur within sections and phrases rather than at their openings, unlike in the style of Josquin. [...] Another stylistic <b>feature</b> <b>characteristic</b> of La Rue's motets is the use of ostinatos, which may be a single note, an interval, or a series of notes. [...] In addition he uses germinal motifs – small easily recognizable patterns from which larger melodic units are derived, and which give unity to a composition. [...] Overall the motets are complex contrapuntally, with the individual lines having a distinctive character, in the manner of Ockeghem. [...] This is most true in the early works which were likely influenced by the older composer.|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{etiology}} of foot intertrigo is varied. Several pathogens and skin conditions might {{play a role}} in toe web space lesions. Objective. To identify the possible etiological causes of toe web space lesions. Methods. 100 Egyptian patients were enrolled in this study (72 females and 28 males). Their ages ranged from 18 to 79 years. For every patient, detailed history taking, general and skin examinations, and investigations including Wood’s light examination, skin scraping for potassium hydroxide test, skin swabs for bacterial isolation, and skin biopsy all were done. Results. Among the 100 patients, positive Wood’s light fluorescence was observed in 24 and positive bacterial growth was observed in 85. With skin biopsy, 52 patients showed <b>features</b> <b>characteristic</b> for eczema, 25 showed <b>features</b> <b>characteristic</b> for fungus, 19 showed <b>features</b> <b>characteristic</b> for callosity, and 3 showed <b>features</b> <b>characteristic</b> for wart while in only 1 patient the <b>features</b> were <b>characteristic</b> for lichen planus. Conclusion. Toe web space lesions are caused by different etiological factors. The most common was interdigital eczema (52 %) followed by fungal infection (25 %). We suggest that patients who do not respond to antifungals should be reexamined for another primary or secondary dermatologic condition that may resemble interdigital fungal infection...|$|R

50|$|A <b>feature</b> <b>characteristic</b> of Aplanochytrium is the {{production}} of the ectoplasmic net. The ectoplasmic net is an extension of the ectoplasm and limited by a plasma membrane and forming long threads. It is secreted and attached to the cell by bothrosomes, which are specialized organelles blocking the leaking of the organelles from the cell into the ectoplasmic net. The cells are not surrounded by the ectoplasmic net, unlike the Labyrinthula cells. The binding of the cells to the net allows a slow gliding movement of the cell along the threads.|$|E
