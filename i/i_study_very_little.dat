40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 Ubiquitination is a posttranslational {{modification}} {{that regulates}} virtually {{every aspect of}} cellular function in eukaryotes including cell cycle progression, endocytosis, cell signaling, transcription, translation, DNA damage and even autophagy. Substrate modification with ubiquitin (Ub) requires the coordination of two types of enzymes: Ub-conjugating enzymes (E 2 s) and Ub ligases (E 3 s). While E 3 s are generally thought to bind substrates, substrate ubiquitination can be performed by either an E 2 or an E 3, {{depending on the type}} of E 3. There are three classes of eukaryotic E 3 s: the RING (Really Interesting New Gene) E 3 s, do not contain an active site. They bind E 2 ~Ub and activate Ub transfer directly onto a substrate. RBR (RING-in-between-RING) and HECT (Homologous to E 6 AP C-Terminus) E 3 s contain an active site Cys residue to which Ub is transferred from the E 2 ~Ub to generate a covalent E 3 ~Ub thioester that transfers Ub to a substrate. It was only six years ago that a landmark study discovered that RBR E 3 are indeed not RING-type Es 3 as had been assumed for many years. In 2011, when <b>I</b> began my <b>studies,</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> was known about how RBR E 3 s function. In fact, RBR E 3 s were originally termed RING-type E 3 s based on their primary sequence analysis of the two domains: RING 1 (binds E 2) and RING 2 (contains active site). Based on structural work by other groups, we know today that RING 2 does not contain a typical RING fold whereas RING 1 domains are structurally similar to canonical RINGs. Nevertheless, in my graduate work I demonstrate that RING 1 domains perform opposing functions to canonical RING E 3 s: instead of promoting closed E 2 ~Ub conformations, RING 1 s actively favor open E 2 ~Ub conformations. This strategy ensures that the transfer of Ub proceeds via the active site Cys on RING 2 and therefore that the type of product generated is determined by the RBR E 3 and not by the E 2 (as done in the context of canonical RING domains). That RBR RING 1 domains have opposing functions to canonical RING domains can be explained functionally, yet a structural explanation for this observation is not immediately apparent. I found that a two-residue extension of the second Zn 2 +-loop - unique to RING 1 domains - is largely responsible for promoting open E 2 ~Ubs. Three years ago, an initial study proposed that the RBR E 3 HHARI is able to bind to neddylated cullins (N 8 -CUL) which are RING-type E 3 s; and that this interaction results in activation of the normally auto-inhibited HHARI. The biological significance of this complex formation was perplexing. In conjunction with others, my work shows that two types of E 3 s, the RBR E 3 HHARI and the RING E 3 N 8 -CUL- 1, work together with their respective E 2 s to coordinately ubiquitinate a common substrate and that this plays an essential role in a developmental pathway in C. elegans. This work was based on the combination of structural, biochemical and organismal studies that led to a deeper understanding of how RBR E 3 s work. Ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification that regulates virtually every aspect of cellular function in eukaryotes including cell cycle progression, endocytosis, cell signaling, transcription, translation, DNA damage and even autophagy.
