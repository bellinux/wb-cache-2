5|$|After {{an honorable}} {{discharge}} from the Army in 1952 with the rank of staff sergeant, he returned home to <b>headlines</b> <b>in</b> The New York Amsterdam News.|$|E
5|$|He {{was placed}} on injured reserve but made <b>headlines</b> <b>in</b> early November when he got into a {{shouting}} match with GM Bobby Beathard {{and one of the}} coaches, resulting in a fine, a suspension without pay and an apology by Leaf (four weeks later). During his suspension, he was caught on video playing flag football at a San Diego park, a violation of his contract according to Charger management.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Shaw was a fourteen-year-old British schoolgirl who drowned while {{crossing}} a swollen stream on Dartmoor during training for Ten Tors in 2007. Her death, {{the first to}} occur in connection with Ten Tors or one of its training expeditions, made national news <b>headlines</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom. She was {{with a group of}} students from Edgehill College trekking the route of Ten Tors in training for the main event when the group got into difficulties {{crossing a}} stream. Shaw slipped into the water and was washed downstream. She was located 20 minutes later by a Royal Navy search and rescue helicopter and airlifted to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, where she died {{in the early hours of}} the next morning.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Carroll {{was elected}} to the Kentucky Senate from District 7, {{defeating}} Harold Fletcher – the older brother of then-governor Ernie Fletcher – by a wide margin. The district included all or portions of Anderson, Fayette, Franklin, and Woodford counties. He made <b>headlines</b> <b>in</b> 2007 when he called on Fletcher's lieutenant governor, Steve Pence, to resign for his disloyalty after Pence endorsed Anne Northup in the Republican gubernatorial primary rather than backing Fletcher's re-election bid. Pence refused to resign, citing an investigation of the administration's hiring practices as his reason for refusing to endorse Fletcher. Fletcher won the Republican primary, but lost in the general election to Democrat Steve Beshear.|$|E
5|$|One famous {{demonstration}} of Dunstan's charismatic style and media savvy came in January 1976. A psychic predicted that, due to Dunstan and the state's social liberalisation—which {{he saw as}} sinful—God would destroy Adelaide with a tsunami caused by an earthquake. This was publicised by the media, prompting a not insignificant number of residents to sell their property and leave; some businesses had clearance sales while many who decided to stay indulged in doomsday parties. Dunstan promised {{to stand on the}} seashore at Glenelg and wait for the imminent destruction. He did so on 20 January, the day of the predicted storm, and nothing happened, although he made newspaper <b>headlines</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom for his defiance.|$|E
5|$|Shearer was {{promoted}} to the first team after spending two years with the youth squad. He made his professional debut for Southampton on 26 March 1988, coming on as a substitute in a First Division fixture at Chelsea, before prompting national <b>headlines</b> <b>in</b> his full debut at The Dell two weeks later. He scored a hat-trick, helping the team to a 4–2 victory against Arsenal, thus becoming the youngest player – at 17 years, 240 days – to score a hat-trick in the top division, breaking Jimmy Greaves' 30-year–old record. Shearer ended the 1987–88 season with three goals in five games, and was rewarded with his first professional contract.|$|E

5|$|The event made {{newspaper}} <b>headlines</b> <b>in</b> Jamaica and {{was also}} the subject of reporting in both the United Kingdom and the United States. While voices on social media accused Jones of provoking his killers by cross-dressing in public, the murder was condemned by Jamaican educators and the country's Justice Minister. In {{the wake of the}} attack, both domestic and international organisations devoted to LGBT rights and human rights – among them Human Rights Watch, Jamaicans for Justice, and the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals & Gays – asked the Jamaican authorities for a proper investigation and legal recognition of LGBT rights on the island.|$|E
5|$|United's playing kit {{consists}} of tangerine shirts and black shorts, first used {{when the team}} played under the Dallas Tornado moniker in the United Soccer Association competition of 1967, which they {{were invited to participate}} in after their first European excursion had created many <b>headlines</b> <b>in</b> the football world. After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr, the colour would soon be adopted as the club's own in 1969 to give the club a brighter, more modern image. The new colour was paraded {{for the first time in}} a pre-season friendly against Everton in August.|$|E
5|$|After being {{linked to}} girlfriend Dahn Bryan, {{a model and}} actress, early in his NHL career, Bure shared a {{relationship}} with tennis star and fellow Russian Anna Kournikova. The two met in 1999 {{when she was still}} linked to Bure's former Russian teammate Sergei Fedorov. Bure and Kournikova were reported to have been engaged in 2000 after reporter Andrew Greven took a photo of them together in a Florida restaurant where Bure supposedly asked Kournikova to marry him. As the story made <b>headlines</b> <b>in</b> Russia, where they were both heavily followed in the media as celebrities, Bure and Kournikova both denied any engagement. Kournikova, 10 years younger than Bure, was 18 years old at the time. The following year, Kournikova and Fedorov were married in Moscow, though they soon divorced.|$|E

5|$|Newspaper <b>headlines</b> <b>in</b> most World Cup nations trumpeted the {{shocking}} upset, except ironically in the United States and England. There {{was only one}} American journalist at the World Cup: Dent McSkimming of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch; he could not persuade the newspaper {{to pay for the}} trip, and had taken time off work to cover the event. His report of the match was the only one to appear in any major American newspaper. In England, newspapers at the time were generally small, and only had a single page devoted to sports. Because the English cricket team happened to suffer their first-ever defeat by the West Indies the very same day, that was the major story in most publications. Legend has it that in publications that did report the World Cup match, so unexpected was the result that it was presumed that the 1–0 scoreline was a typing error and so it was reported that England had won on a scoreline of 10–0 or 10–1. However, historical newspapers online at The British Newspaper Archive show that the story is a myth.|$|E
5|$|On July 22, 1916, Riley {{suffered}} a second stroke. He recovered enough {{during the day}} to speak and joke with his companions. He died before dawn the next morning, July 23. Riley's death shocked the nation and made front page <b>headlines</b> <b>in</b> major newspapers. President Woodrow Wilson wrote a brief note to Riley's family offering condolences {{on behalf of the}} entire nation. Indiana Governor Samuel M. Ralston offered to allow Riley to lie in state at the Indiana Statehouse—Abraham Lincoln being the only other person to have previously received such an honor. During the ten hours he lay in state on July 24, more than thirty-five thousand people filed past his bronze casket; the line was still miles long {{at the end of the}} day and thousands were turned away. The next day a private funeral ceremony was held and attended by many dignitaries. A large funeral procession then carried him to Crown Hill Cemetery where he was buried in a tomb at the top of the hill, the highest point in the city of Indianapolis.|$|E
