25|$|Murrow gained {{his first}} glimpse of fame during the March 1938 Anschluss, in which Adolf Hitler {{engineered}} the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany. While Murrow was in Poland arranging a broadcast of children's choruses, he got word from Shirer of the annexationâ€”and the fact that Shirer could not <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> out through Austrian state radio facilities. Murrow immediately sent Shirer to London, where he delivered an uncensored, eyewitness account of the Anschluss. Murrow then chartered the only transportation available, a 23-passenger plane, to fly from Warsaw to Vienna so he could take over for Shirer.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} five scripts were written as Romero {{wrestled}} with the film's concepts and the budgetary constraints. The first draft was over 200 pages, which he later condensed to 122 pages. This is the true original script, and to date no copies of it have come to light. This version was likely rejected because UFDC felt it was too expensive for them to produce even with an R rating. Romero subsequently scaled down {{the scope of this}} script into a 165-page draft (often erroneously referred to as the original version), then condensed it again to a 104-page draft labeled the 'second version, second draft' in an unsuccessful final attempt to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> within budget parameters. When this failed, he drastically altered the original story concept and ultimately produced a shooting draft that numbered only 88 pages.|$|E
25|$|Swanson invited Will Hays {{for lunch}} and {{summarized}} the plot, naming the author and the sticking points. According to Swanson, Hays made a verbal promise {{that he would have}} no problem with the making of such a film. Swanson set about getting the rights to the play by having Schenck pretend to buy it in the name of United Artists, never to be used. Thus they were able to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> rights for $60,000 instead of the original $100,000. When news broke as to just what was intended with the play, the three authors threatened to sue. Swanson later contacted Maugham requesting that he write an original story that served as a sequel. The sequel would involve following what became of Sadie in Australia. Maugham agreed to write a new story (for $100,000) but a sequel was never made.|$|E

25|$|Rosa {{was exposed}} to comics {{at a very young}} age, as his 11-years-older sister was a comics hoarder, and had {{thousands}} of comics for Don to look at and later read. Rosa began drawing comics before being able to write. Until he attended Saint Xavier High School in Louisville, Kentucky, his featured characters were a large cast of stick figures featured in comedy-adventures like the Barks comics and old movies Rosa enjoyed most. He never tried to draw more than stick figures, because the drawings, for him, were illustrations to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> told. Only the story was important to him, not the actual drawings. His favorite comic books growing up were Uncle Scrooge by Western Publishing and Little Lulu comics from Dell Comics (Western Publishing), and his sister's collection of MAD comics and magazines. When he was 12 years old he also discovered and enjoyed the Superman titles by DC Comics of the editor Mort Weisinger period, drawn mostly by his favorite Superman artists Curt Swan and Kurt Schaffenberger. Shortly after starting to collect Superman comics he started to trade the collection of his older sister for Superman Comics. Since a comic book shop in his area traded two old comics for one new, he only had two Duck comics left from his sister's collection by the 1970s, one of them being The Golden Helmet. When he became a serious collector of older comics, he particularly enjoyed the classic E.C. horror and science fiction comics of the 1950s, Will Eisner's The Spirit, Walt Kelly's Pogo, and most comics of the 1940s onward.|$|E

500|$|Charlie's {{sexuality}} was sidelined and {{she began}} a relationship with Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz). Throughout their romance Charlie played out various family oriented plots and was described as having strong feelings for him. Their romance was portrayed to be wayward and unstable. In 2011, their relationship ended after producers felt {{there were no more}} storylines to give to the pair. Charlie later develops feelings for Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke). Another notable storyline for Charlie saw her reveal that her supposed sister, Ruby, was in fact her daughter. Anderson said the filming process was challenging as they felt the need to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> right. Viewers sympathised with Charlie and saw a [...] "beautiful element" [...] in the portrayal. The revelation ruined the on-screen relationship between Charlie and Ruby, and was never repaired.|$|E

Others of the Port Chicago 50 had refused to ask for a pardon, reasoning that a pardon is for guilty people receiving forgiveness; they continued to hold the position that they were not guilty of mutiny. Meeks pushed for a pardon as a way to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> out, saying [...] "I hope that all of America knows about it... it's something that's been in the closet for so long." [...] In September 1999, the petition by Meeks was bolstered by 37 members of Congress including George Miller, the U.S. representative for the district containing the disaster site. The 37 Congressmen sent a letter to President Bill Clinton and in December 1999, Clinton pardoned Meeks, who died in June 2003. Efforts to posthumously exonerate all 50 sailors have continued.

500|$|In a 2002 interview, Ridley Scott {{stated that}} a new Alien project [...] "would {{be a lot of}} fun", but that [...] "the most {{important}} thing was to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> right". Scott's concept for the plot was [...] "to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created", which became the basis of his prequel series. In late 2008, Weaver hinted in an interview with MTV that she and Scott were working on an Alien spinoff film, which would focus on the chronicles of Ellen Ripley rather than on the Aliens, but the continuation of Ripley's story has not materialized. Instead, Scott worked on a prequel that explained the [...] "Space Jockey" [...] found on the derelict spacecraft from Alien, titled Prometheus, which was released in June 8, 2012. Scott and Damon Lindelof developed a story that precedes the story of Alien but is not directly connected to that franchise. According to Scott, although the film shares [...] "strands of Alien's DNA so to speak", and takes place in the same universe, Prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas. A sequel to Prometheus, titled , was released in May 19, 2017.|$|E
500|$|Before 20th Century Fox gave Alien vs. Predator the greenlight, Aliens writer/{{director}} James Cameron {{had been}} working on a story for a fifth Alien film. Alien director Ridley Scott had talked with Cameron, stating [...] "I {{think it would be a}} lot of fun, but the most important thing is to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> right." [...] In a 2002 interview, Scott's concept for a story was [...] "to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created"; this project eventually became Scott's film Prometheus (2012). On learning that Fox intended to pursue Alien vs. Predator, Cameron believed the film would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise" [...] and ceased work on his story, [...] "To me, that was Frankenstein Meets Werewolf. It was Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other...Milking it." [...] After viewing Alien vs. Predator, however, Cameron remarked that [...] "it was actually pretty good. I think of the five Alien films, I'd rate it third. I actually liked it. I actually liked it a lot." [...] Conversely, Ridley Scott had no interest in the Alien vs. Predator films. When asked in May 2012 if he had watched them, Scott laughed, [...] "No. I couldn't do that. I couldn't quite take that step." [...] Director Neill Blomkamp would eventually go on to pitch his sequel to Aliens.|$|E

500|$|To {{create the}} look of Frozen, Giaimo began {{pre-production}} research by reading extensively about the entire region of Scandinavia and visiting the Danish-themed city of Solvang near Los Angeles, but eventually zeroed in on Norway in particular because [...] "80 percent" [...] of the visuals that appealed to him were from Norway. Disney eventually sponsored three research field trips. Animators and special effects specialists were dispatched to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to experience walking, running, and falling in deep snow {{in a variety of}} types of attire, including long skirts (which both female and male personnel tried on); while lighting and arts teams visited an Ice Hotel in Quebec City, Quebec to study how light reflects and refracts on snow and ice. Finally, Giaimo and several artists traveled to Norway to draw inspiration from its mountains, fjords, architecture, and culture. [...] "We had a very short time schedule for this film, so our main focus was really to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> right but we knew that John Lasseter is keen on truth in the material and creating a believable world, and again that doesn't mean it's a realistic worldâ€“ but a believable one.

2500|$|Channel 8's {{approach}} to news {{during this period}} was characterized by an aggressive, all-out commitment to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> and to present it in graphic, visual detail. The station was rewarded {{with some of the}} highest ratings of any local station in a major media market. A standard practice was to have each reporter cover only one beat, such as Dallas City Hall or the Dallas County Commission, making the reporter an expert on the subject that he or she was covering. Former news director H.

Haag was honored with a special Lifetime Achievement George Foster Peabody Award shortly before his death in 2004. The station resumed a local morning newscast in 1987, when it launched the initially 60-minute traditional news program News 8 Daybreak (which evolved out of local news inserts that it aired during World News This Morning). WFAA pioneered community outreach in 1977 with the [...] "Wednesday's Child" [...] series of feature segments, which profiled children in need of an adoptive family and was descended from a feature segment on News 8 Etc.; the current iteration was initially conducted by John Criswell during his stint as co-host of the retooled AM, before becoming a weekly feature on WFAA's 10:00p.m. newscast in September 1980.
