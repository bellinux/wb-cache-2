The patient’s perspective is essential when assessing risk for adverse events at hospital discharge. Developed in the USA, the Readiness for Hospital <b>Discharge</b> <b>Scale</b> is the only instrument that measures an individual’s self-perception of readiness before leaving the hospital. A French version of the Readiness for Hospital <b>Discharge</b> <b>Scale</b> was developed and validated. Design. Cross-sectional study. Methods. A convenience sample of 265 older inpatients from four medical units was selected. The translation and cultural adaptation of the scale involved experts in gerontology and the French language and included back translation. The items were semantically evaluated and pretested in 10 older inpatients. The scale’s psychometric properties were internally validated by using confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses. Reliability was assessed by examining the internal consistency of its items. Results. Goodness-of-fit indices of the confirmatory factor analyses were not adequate, but reliability was acceptable (Cronbach’s a = 0 _ 80). Exploratory factor analysis of the French version provided results close to those described for the English version, with three similar subscales (physical and emotional readiness, coping with medical treatment and personal care), whereas the initially described Expected Support subscale was not identified in the French version. Conclusion. The Readiness for Hospital <b>Discharge</b> <b>Scale</b> – French version appears to be partially consistent with its original English version, but requires additional adaptation to fully take into account the Swiss context and culture to achieve its original aim. Relevance to clinical practice. Assessing patient readiness for hospital discharge before leaving hospital could help nurses to improve the discharge planning process and achieve better patient preparedness and care coordination...|$|R

The radiative transfer equation (RTE) considering gas and particle radiation in a non-uniform plume has been adopted and solved by the finite volume method (FVM) to compute the three dimensional, spectral and directional radiation of a plume in the infrared waveband 2 – 6 μm. Conditions at wavelengths 2. 7 μm and 4. 3 μm are discussed in detail, and ratios of plume radiation for reduced-scale through full-scale models are examined. This work shows that, with increasing <b>scale</b> <b>ratio</b> of a computed rocket motor, area of the high-temperature core increases as a 2 power function of the <b>scale</b> <b>ratio,</b> and the radiation intensity of the plume increases with 2 – 2. 5 power of the <b>scale</b> <b>ratio.</b> The infrared radiation of plume gases shows a strong spectral dependency, while that of Al 2 O 3 particles shows spectral continuity of gray media. Spectral radiation intensity of a computed solid rocket plume’s high temperature core increases significantly in peak radiation spectra of plume gases CO and CO 2. Al 2 O 3 particles are the major radiation component in a rocket plume. There is good similarity between contours of plume spectral radiance from different scale models of computed rockets, and there are two peak spectra of radiation intensity at wavebands 2. 7 – 3. 0 μm and 4. 2 – 4. 6 μm.

Each scaling variable {{is assumed to be}} normally distributed. The uncertainty of the scaling relationship arises from systematic differences between the regional changes from global and regional climate model simulations and from natural variability. The contributions of these sources of uncertainty to the total variance of the scaling variable are estimated from simulated temperature and precipitation data in a suite of regional climate model experiments conducted {{within the framework of the}} EU-funded project PRUDENCE, using an Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA). For the area covered in the 2001 ? 2004 EU-funded project SWURVE, five case study regions (CSRs) are considered: NW England, the Rhine basin, Iberia, Jura lakes (Switzerland) and Mauvoisin dam (Switzerland). The resulting regional climate changes for 2070 ? 2099 vary quite significantly between CSRs, between seasons and between meteorological variables. For all CSRs, the expected warming in summer is higher than that expected for the other seasons. This summer warming is accompanied by a large decrease in precipitation. The uncertainty of the <b>scaling</b> <b>ratios</b> for temperature and precipitation is relatively large in summer because of the differences between regional climate models. Differences between the spatial climate-change patterns of global climate model simulations make significant contributions to the uncertainty of the <b>scaling</b> <b>ratio</b> for temperature.

Simulation from the probability distributions of global mean warming and the <b>scaling</b> <b>ratio</b> results in a wider range of regional temperature change than that in the regional climate model experiments.
