5|$|The Soft Parade is {{the fourth}} studio album by the American rock band the Doors, and was {{released}} on Elektra Records on July 18, 1969. Most of the album was recorded following a grueling tour during which the band was left with little time to compose new material. Record producer Paul A. Rothchild recommended a total departure from the Doors' first three albums: develop a fuller sound by incorporating brass and string arrangements provided by Paul Harris. Lead singer <b>Jim</b> <b>Morrison,</b> who was dealing with personal issues and focusing more on his poetry, was less involved in the songwriting process, leaving guitarist Robby Krieger to increase his own creative output. As a result, The Soft Parade is a somewhat uneven album that is less unified compared to previous works by the Doors.|$|E
