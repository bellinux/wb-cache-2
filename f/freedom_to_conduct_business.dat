40|$|In recent years, {{intellectual}} property enforcement by ordering Internet access providers to block infringing websites has been rapidly evolving in Europe. Understandable {{from the perspective}} of rightholders searching for the most efficient ways to stop infringing activities, this increasing tendency to seek for website blocking raises several interrelated legal questions. Those range from the extent to which new enforcement models should burden the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> a <b>business</b> of intermediaries to how this practice affects the ability of Internet users to access information of their choice and exercise their freedom of expression in the online environment. Interestingly, the requests for blocking injunctions have also provoked counter-reactions, initiating a “breakthrough” in the European judiciary because of the recognition of user rights as enforceable rights of equal value to those of rightholders. This article approaches these (and other) questions {{from the perspective of}} three fundamental rights that {{play a major role in}} website blocking cases and which, according to judicial practice, need to be balanced against each other: the users’ freedom of expression, the ISPs’ <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> a <b>business,</b> and the copyright holders’ right to property. To this end, it analyses the recent key decisions on the matter from two major European courts – the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights – reflecting further on their actual and potential impact on national decisions. Using the context of this European case law to elaborate standards applicable in the field of website blocking, this article ultimately questions appropriateness of currently prioritised enforcement strategies, pointing to the need to explore possible alternative solutions...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the use of the}} EU Charter of Fundamental Rights as a tool of interpretation. Specifically, it assesses the influence of the Charter on the CJEU’s existing purposive approach to the interpretation of employment legislation. From its inception, the Charter has been lauded for its inclusion of a number of employee-protective rights. The CJEU’s early use of the Charter certainly appeared promising, with a number of legislative provisions seeming to be bolstered by a fundamental rights reading. On closer inspection, has the Charter really made any difference? It is shown that the Charter is simultaneously evolutionary and yet revolutionary. It is evolutionary in that the social rights derive largely from pre-existing legislation which has long been given a purposive and usually employee-friendly reading. It is revolutionary in that the economic freedoms, although similarly steeped in long-standing jurisprudence, have emboldened the CJEU to disrupt existing approaches to the interpretation of legislation. Of particular concern is the CJEU’s radical reinterpretation of the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> a <b>business</b> in the case of Alemo-Herron...|$|R
40|$|Telecoms {{industry}} is a highly specialised industry {{and there is a}} general consensus that it requires a specially designed regulatory system. Besides the many technology-oriented regulations, this regulatory system not only integrates many economic theories and concepts taken from competition law, but also features several measures designed ad hoc to deal with the character of the industry, such as a natural monopoly, bottlenecks and a public service. A major category of these regulatory measures is forced access mechanisms. "Forced access" in this thesis refers to the forcing open of certain property – mostly telecoms networks and relevant facilities – to be accessed by others, especially other competitors in the market. While these mechanisms do indeed promote competition in the telecoms market and benefit the public, they also limit the fundamental rights of telecoms companies – mostly incumbents – as legal persons, especially concerning their property rights and <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> a <b>business,</b> and it does not need emphasising further that the protection of fundamental rights is a general principle in the European Union and a constitutional value in modern democratic states. This thesis aims to take three distinct telecoms forced access mechanisms (interconnection, local loop unbundling and separation), with different regulatory intensities, as examples to discuss the possible fundamental rights derogation issues of two targeted jurisdictions – the European Union and Taiwan. There are some substantial reasons for this comparative study. On the one hand, many of the regulatory concepts of the telecoms regulatory framework in the European Union, together with those in the United States, have been adopted by Taiwan; on the other hand, the protection of fundamental rights in the European Union is inspired by the constitutional traditions common to Member States, and the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz) plays an important role, while the Taiwanese Constitution and the constitutionality reviews system derive from Germany (continental law) and the United States (common law). The reasoning of Taiwanese constitutional review does not therefore just reflect the fundamental rights protection system but also introduces the constitutionality review system of the United States as a reference. This thesis starts with an introduction to telecoms forced access mechanisms in the European Union and Taiwan, with a special focus on three selected forced access mechanisms. Then, fundamental rights protection system under the two jurisdictions will be discussed, followed by an in-depth discussion of the concepts of property rights and <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> a <b>business.</b> This thesis goes on to analyse how to appraise the three telecoms forced access mechanisms in relation to the fundamental rights protection system and to discuss the reasonableness of such an analysis. The final part of the thesis will, by reviewing the legal frameworks of the two jurisdictions, offer answers to the questions raised in the analysis...|$|R

40|$|A {{market economy}} is the economy in which both {{physical}} persons and legal entities act in a legal framework established {{by the government and}} where the government does not have a major intervention on the market. Competition provides choices, improves product quality through efficient use of resources and stimulates economic growth by increasing investments. Some of the economic resources are land, labor and capital. Another resource is entrepreneurship, that is the individual's capacity to transform the production of economic resources in a business. The role of competition in a market economy is to allow more people and businesses to use resources as efficiently as possible in order to obtain the best products. To have a market functioning properly, it must comply with principles such as the principle of good faith or the consumers. These principles give the manufacturers the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> their <b>business</b> according <b>to</b> their own decisions and to be protected only if they base their success on their own merits.

40|$|With the {{development}} of cyberspace, mankind’s ability to exchange tremendous amounts of information reached astonishing and praise-worthy levels. Unfortunately, such information also includes digital content infringing a variety of legitimate interests, such as copyright, trademarks, privacy, and reputation. Despite the increased regulatory activity of governments {{from all over the}} world, aimed at developing adequate legal frameworks governing the removal of access to such content, there are still significant concerns over the performance of this particular branch of online enforcement policy; concerns such as lack of effectiveness, or the impact of the endorsed solutions on the human rights framework. The following thesis is aimed at responding to those concerns, {{from the perspective of the}} European Union’s law. The work’s overarching aim is to devise the most adequate, pan-European legal framework governing the removal of access to online content which infringes copyright, trademarks, privacy or is defamatory in nature. While those four content types differ from one another, this project delivers additional value by discovering such differences (as well as similarities) in the enforcement context, and taking them into account in its analysis and recommendations. The path towards attaining the thesis’ research objective is drawn through the following five chapters. The first chapter begins by gathering and organising the legal provisions which, if broken, can mark a piece of digital content as one infringing copyright, trademarks, privacy or reputation. The said provisions are then applied to a wide array of factual scenarios in which the described types of infringing content appear in cyberspace. It should be noted that the thesis draws in this context primarily on the EU law; where this is not possible, the UK law is relied on. This is justifiable by the project’s focus on the enforcement schemes, not on the definitions of infringing content. The second chapter lays out the vast landscape of enforcement schemes endorsed within the EU for the purpose of removing access to the four chosen types of infringing content, both directly and indirectly. Such schemes are divided on those focused on the infringers themselves, and those focused on the intermediaries whose services are used for facilitating the transfer of infringing content. The chapter can be seen as laying out all the tools from the (regulatory) toolbox before deciding which ones to use - or alterate - for the task at hand. The third chapter is the first of the two key, critically analytical chapters; it seeks to uncover and analyse the main challenges tied to the enforcement schemes’ effectiveness. To this end, it begins by analysing three primary concerns of this kind; the renewal of access to infringing content (on a single platform), movements towards the alternative sources of infringing content, and circumvention of the enforcement schemes’ technological aspects. This is followed by the analysis of the deeper effectiveness-related concerns (which often underlie the primary ones). They include the lack of deterrence, the notion of diminishing returns and the issue of social acceptance of infringing activities. The fourth chapter explores the human rights implications of the enforcement schemes, with attention given to the balance struck within the EU law between the human rights protected by the said schemes, and those impaired by them. This is attained through two subchapters; the first one introduces the human rights involved and defines their scope, while the second discusses the enforcement schemes’ impact on the three most affected human rights – the right <b>to</b> privacy, the <b>freedom</b> of expression and the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> a <b>business.</b> The conclusive, fifth chapter builds on its predecessors and proposes a fundamental upheaval of the approach to intermediary liability within the EU law, an upheaval aimed at responding to the concerns identified in chapters three and four and improving the degree of legal certainty within this branch of online enforcement. The chapter contains a corresponding proposal for a major reform of the EU legal framework...|$|R

40|$|According to EU and {{international}} trade mark law, signs that are contrary to public policy or to accepted principles of morality may be denied registration. Public policy and morality are open legal concepts {{that provide a}} typical entrance door for fundamental rights, allowing the taking into account of ethical values when defining the content and scope of intellectual property law. As IP offices are EU or national institutions that are bound by fundamental rights protection, the conformity of their practice needs to be tested {{with regard to the}}se higher constitutional principles. In this article, we will verify if the current practices with regard to the refusal to register immoral trade marks on morality and public policy grounds take sufficiently into account fundamental rights, and in particular the freedom of expression and <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>business</b> of trade marks applicants. If the decisions of the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) will be given the main attention, those of the General Court of the European Union (GCEU), the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and the EFTA Court will also be considered. The European practice will then be compared to the recent case law on this topic in the United States, in particular to the Supreme Court decision Matal v. Tam of June 2017, already considered by some commentators as a historical development as it overturns a long tradition of trade mark precedent barring from protection offensive and disparaging trade marks. We conclude that the implications of fundamental rights protection in the EU might lead to different results than in the US and that the practice developed by the EUIPO with regard to immoral trade marks is in general consistent with the standards required by the European legal order. However, there might be some (rare) situations where a new approach could be needed in the future, for example when the trade mark application can qualify as mixed expression, both commercial and political or artistic in nature...|$|E
40|$|The use of self-regulatory or privatized {{enforcement}} {{measures in the}} online environment can give rise to various legal issues that affect the fundamental rights of internet users. First, privatized enforcement by internet services, without state involvement, can interfere with the effective exercise of fundamental rights by internet users. Such interference may, on occasion, be disproportionate, but there are legal complexities involved in determining the precise circumstances in which this is the case. This is because, for instance, the private entities can themselves claim protection under the fundamental rights framework (e. g. the protection of property and the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>business).</b> Second, the role of public authorities {{in the development of}} self-regulation in view of certain public policy objectives can become problematic, but has to be carefully assessed. The fundamental rights framework puts limitations on government regulation that interferes with fundamental rights. Essentially, such limitations involve the (negative) obligation for States not to interfere with fundamental rights. Interferences have to be prescribed by law, pursue a legitimate aim and be necessary in a democratic society. At the same time, however, States are also under the (positive) obligation to take active measures in order to ensure the effective exercise of fundamental rights. In other words, States must do more than simply refrain from interference. These positive obligations are of specific interest in the context of private ordering impact on fundamental rights, but tend to be abstract and hard to operationalize in specific legal constellations. This study’s central research question is: What legal limitations follow from the fundamental rights framework for self-regulation and privatized enforcement online? It examines the circumstances in which State responsibility can be engaged as a result of selfregulation or privatized enforcement online. Part I of the study provides an overview and analysis of the relevant elements in the European and international fundamental rights framework that place limitations on privatized enforcement. Part II gives an assessment of specific instances of self-regulation or other instances of privatized enforcement in light of these elements...|$|E

40|$|This thesis scrutinizes the {{proportionality}} {{and describes}} the subsidiarity of proposals for security breach notification laws (hereafter: SBNLs) in the European Union. An SBNL obliges that a security breach within a company or government must be notified to affected customers and a supervisory authority. A law stands the proportionality test if {{the requirements of}} effectiveness and necessity are met. Effectiveness {{means that there is}} a causal relationship between the measure and the aim pursued. Necessity means that no less restrictive policy options are available that achieve the same aims. The closely linked subsidiarity test assesses the necessity of the European Union approach: the question whether the aims of the SBNL and cybersecurity cannot be achieved sufficiently by the Member States individually. Subsidiarity is to a great extent a political question and consequently described more limitedly. Why these tests? Proportionality and subsidiarity are fundamental principles of EU law. They demand the European legislature not to go beyond what is necessary to attain the objectives in the Treaties and to only adopt measures if a European Union approach has added value. The European Court of Justice scrutinizes whether European legislation is in accordance with these principles. The laws that have been assessed are Article 31 of the proposed Data Protection Regulation (hereafter: PDPR) and Article 14 of the proposed Cybersecurity Directive (hereafter: PCD). Article 31 PDPR concerns a single uniform personal data breach notification obligation. A personal data breach entails the unauthorized access to and/or theft of personal data. Article 14 PCD concerns the harmonization of national (significant) loss of integrity breach notification obligations. A loss of integrity concerns the loss of control over computer systems. A personal data breach always entails a loss of integrity, but a loss of integrity can also occur without the loss of personal data. The aim of the SBNL in the PDPR is “to ensure that individuals are in control of their personal data and trust the digital environment” in order to “increase the effectiveness of the fundamental right to data protection”. The aim of the SBNL in the PCD is: “to create a culture of risk management and improve the sharing of information between the private and public sectors. ” The subsidiarity question covers cybersecurity in general and SBNLs in particular. The Commission argues that a European cybersecurity approach is necessary because of the cross border aspect of the Internet, the necessity of a uniform secure Internet for the Single Market and the protection of fundamental rights. Indeed, there is European cybersecurity legislation and a European cybersecurity policy framework. Regarding the PDPR and the PCD in particular, the Commission argues {{that there is a need}} to harmonize national initiatives in order to create a level playing field, legal certainty and lower administrative burdens for companies to notify. A literature review in this thesis shows that the United States aims to replace a state level SBNLs by a federal SBNL. The obligation to comply simultaneously with multiple SBNLs caused significant administrative burdens for companies. This strengthens the conception that SBNLs can better be achieved at a European level, although this remains a political consideration. From an apolitical point of view, this thesis did not find a convincing argument about the inappropriateness of a European approach regarding cybersecurity and SBNLs. The proportionality test contains two elements. The first element of the proportionality test, the effectiveness test, is performed more extensively in this thesis than the Commission did in its impact assessment of both the PDPR and the PCD. Legal scholars and the European legislator, usually assess the first aspect of proportionality limitedly. In the PDPR and PCD, the Commission did not mention in what way the SBNL is suitable to achieve the aim “to ensure that individuals are in control of their personal data and thrust in the digital environment” and “to create a culture of risk management and improvement of information sharing between private and public parties”. This is a deficiency in the analysis of legislation. This thesis challenges the aforementioned assumption that determination of causality is straightforward. This is done by a more substantive assessment of the proportionality test. This thesis contributes an empirical study from a security economics perspective, in order to substantively review (the complexity of) effects of SBNLs. Do the (expected) effects of SBNLs match the aims it should attain according to the European proposals? And are these effects desirable? Legal impact assessments can benefit from this perspective, because knowledge about the effectiveness of the law will be enhanced. To structure the empirical study, a first and second order effect of SBNLs have been distinguished. The first order effect is the effect of (characteristics of) SBNLs on the amount of breach notifications. Generating notifications is not one of the final aims of the proposed legislation, but a means to achieve the second order effect. The second order effect includes the positive and negative effects of the law on society. A literature review is conducted to provide an overview of what is already known concerning those two effects. The quantitative analysis systematically assesses the first order effect of American SBNLs by a longitudinal dataset containing security breach notifications. The subsequent qualitative analysis reviews the perception of Dutch security experts and managers regarding the first and second order effect and outcomes of the quantitative analysis. The results can substantiate the first element of the Commissions’ proportionality test of European SBNLs: This study proves the first order effect empirically by means of analyzing American data. The laws have an effect on the amount of breach notifications. The effect is relatively large: a notification increase of at least 50 % can be attributed to the law, by a fixed effects regression analyzing differences in breach notification before and after the introduction of the law. The database is partly constructed by underlying sources that only register officially notified breaches, which can explain this high relative increase. From an absolute perspective, the effect is minor: less than 0. 05 % of the companies notified a security breach in America in the eight-year period that was researched. To compare: a recent study in the United Kingdom published that 88 % of the companies surveyed had experienced data theft in 2009. The low absolute number of breaches could be explained by the incompleteness of the dataset, high compliance costs for a company due to reputation damage and unawareness of breaches. The introduction of the law thus has a structural first order effect, at least in the database of known security breaches. It is however ambiguous which aspects of the law cause this effect. Literature review and qualitative analysis showed that enforced sanctions generate compliance with the law and that reputation damage is a major driver for non-compliance. Confidential treatment of the notification and benefits from information sharing about security breaches are perceived as minor incentives for compliance. The quantitative analysis only confirmed that some American laws qualified as strict by American Attorneys cause an increase in notifications, but it is ambiguous what exactly makes these laws strict. The literature review and the qualitative study demonstrated several positive second order effects perceived in literature and by security managers and experts, such as increased investments in security, fostered cooperation between companies (literature only), increased awareness of consumers of security breaches and faster risk mitigation. The first two effects match with the aim of the PCD to 1.) create a culture of risk management and 2.) enhance information exchange between the private and public sectors respectively. The last two effects correspond with the aim of the PDPR to enhance personal data control of individuals. However, the positive effects can be nuanced. The security managers interviewed already shared security information with competitors, and did not see an incentive for cooperation with the government following from a security breach notification, because they did not value the government as a center of expertise. Moreover, a security expert challenged the effect of increased investments in security because the law provides an incentive to notify, not to improve security practices. Accepting the ‘risk’ of a notification might be less expensive than improving security practices in order to avoid notifications. This is however not confirmed in literature review or by other qualitative analysis, which implicates that the risk of not providing incentives to improve security practices at all must be perceived as low. Lastly, an increased number of security breach notifications might result in an overload of information that could also result in disinterest and a notification fatigue instead of enhanced awareness and risk mitigation. This overload is not a big treat given the current low amount of notified security breaches. For instance, in America, about 600 million records were breached in the eight-year period observed. This would entail that, on average, an American citizen would be notified twice in eight year. Hence, the second order effects in literature and qualitative analysis, although they are perceptions that can be nuanced, do match the objectives pursued in legislation. But, the objectives are vaguely defined and while their attainment could constitute effectiveness in the legal sense, the question remains what makes an SBNL effective and when an SBNL is effective. Moreover, there are also additional negative effects associated with SBNL in literature and qualitative analysis, such as reputational costs and maintenance costs. The second element of the proportionality test concerns the question whether there are less restrictive equally effective measures available. The SBNL can restrict companies, because it infringes the fundamental freedom to conduct a business by imposing administrative, compliance- and reputational costs. This study offers two observations concerning this infringement. First, the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>business</b> is more infringed than the Commission states. The cost assessment of the Commission only included the costs of making a notification, which are estimated between 125 euro and 20000 euro per notification. But, literature and qualitative analysis showed that there are costs that the Commission did not take into account, such as the reputation damage incurred (estimations up to 2 % of a company’s turnover) and the costs of processing and enforcement of breach notifications. The cost estimation of the Commission thus is undervalued compared with the total societal costs of an SBNL. Second, the coexistence of the PDPR and the PCD unnecessarily infringes the freedom to provide a business as it imposes unnecessary costs for companies. In many cases, a breach thus should be notified twice to both the European supervisory authority and to the competent national authority, because the scope of personal data loss and loss of integrity overlap. Second, the proposals are regulated by a different legal instrument and emit different signals. The confidential treatment in the PCD will not function properly if simultaneously companies are forced to publicly disclose the same information in the PDPR. To conclude, the fuzziness of the aims and the complexity of measuring effects hamper the determination of a reasonable expectation of causality between the measure and the aims pursued. The Commission sets aims that are fuzzy and hard to measure, and does not specify how these goals will be achieved through the adoptions of SBNLs. Likewise, the empirical measurement of effects in part ? showed that it is complex to pinpoint effects of SBNLs. Moreover, the Commission undervalued societal costs and adverse effects. In my view, in the current situation, a reasonable expectation of effectiveness is not demonstrated sufficiently. In the theoretically desired situation, the goals are clear and measurable. The law is effective because the measurable aims are achieved by the measure. But, still, effectiveness is not simply attaining aims. Even if the causal relation between the measure and its aims can be proved in a narrow sense, the question remains whether the achievement of these aims is effective. From a security economics perspective, it can be argued that the law is effective if the revenues of positive effects are higher than the societal costs of negative effects. This requires an accurate empirical measurement of these effects, initiated in part ?, and a quantification of these effects. Unfortunately, this approach towards effectiveness does not cover non-economic, non-measurable aims such as the protection of fundamental rights. The protection of fundamental rights is not always ‘efficient’ and can certainly not always be quantified, but European legislation must remain within the boundaries of fundamental rights. Moreover, the complexity of the legal interferences in the field of cybersecurity makes it impossible to provide an exhaustive balance sheet of all (expected) effects. A security economics perspective would not be the perfect means to define effectiveness, because some aims are not measurable and expected effects are complex. Both a legal and an economic approach do not provide an optimal outcome for the definition of ‘effectiveness’. There is no uniformity of what makes a law effective. Thus, still the effectiveness question remains. What is needed to determine the effectiveness of SBNLs? Who may decide when a law is effective? In a democracy, we all should decide. More concrete: the European Commission, Parliament and Council state ex ante in the ordinary legislative procedure the aims of the law. The European Court of Justice decides ex post whether the law is effective. Thus, effectiveness in redefined, as legal and economic approaches towards effectiveness are troublesome. This definition must be regarded as a starting point for further research on interpreting effectiveness of the law. "Effectiveness is the causality between a legislation and its aims defined by a democratic decision making process where as much information as possible about (potential) positive and negative effects is provided. " Hence, taking this definition into account, improving information about potential positive and negative effects is the key tool to enhance effectiveness of the law and correctly assess its necessity. The executed empirical analysis in this thesis has provided knowledge about the effects of SBNLs that can be used by the Commission. Increased availability of information about societal impact (expectations) enhances decision making of the legislature ex ante and the scrutiny of the Court ex post that determine the proportionality of cybersecurity laws. The Commission, which has the power of initiative, should invest to provide this information. To conclude, additional information about effects of legislation on society will improve the quality of draft legislation and the judicial decision about proportionality. For example, information about the adverse reputation damage on companies, demonstrated in this thesis, will play a vital role when judging about the infringement on the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>business.</b> Additional information about effects will not be decisive in a judicial decision, since also non measurable effects need to be balanced and (expected) effects have a certain margin of error. The proportionality test as such must be seen in relation to these inherent flaws within measuring effectiveness of the law on society. Often, causality between the measure and the aim can and will not be ‘proven’ scientifically by the legislature and the Court. Nevertheless, the proportionality principle has been a corner stone of European Law to analyze the effectiveness and necessity of legislation. Further enhancement of the execution of this principle by improving information about societal effects increases the democratic legitimacy of European Union law. Therefore, this thesis recommends the European Commission to enhance information about effects. This can be done to improve the measurement of (the expectation of) effects before and after the adoption of the law. These recommendations can be used for improving European laws in general and the PDPR and PCD in particular. Before the adoption of the law, a reasonable expectation of effectiveness should be provided by the Commission. This entails the operationalization of measurable aims, the separation of non-measurable aims and a substantiated expectation of causality between the law and the aims. This thesis recommends to operationalize aims that are in essence measurable. For instance, the perception of personal data control by European citizens can be measured. Another option is to use a proxy. The amount of personal data security breaches serves as a proxy for the aim of personal data control. Fundamental rights that are associated with the aims of the legislation, such as the freedom of speech and the freedom of expression, have an intrinsic value, which cannot be operationalized. These important non measurable aims should be included separately as informative input for a democratic legislative decision making process. An effective consideration of the democratic decision making process necessitates an extensive overview of potential negative effects as well. To provide a reasonable expectation of effectiveness, an extensive study of the expected effects is recommended by means of academic literature, secondary available comparative (quantitative) analysis and expert interviews. This threefold approach, adhered in this thesis, has enhanced the knowledge about expected effects and requires further development and a wider application. As a result, a conceptual framework clarifies the effects to enhance the decision maker’s information. Before the introduction of the law, the increased information about expected positive and negative effects and non-measurable aims allows for a more enhanced discussion about the desirability of the legislation. Ideally, the expected effects of the measurable part of the legislation will be quantified in order to clarify and structure the discussion about the desirability of the law. Consequently, the discussion solely concerns normative choices about the balance between non quantifiable effects with the sum of the measurable positive effects and negative effects.
