5|$|Several scales {{exist to}} grade the {{severity}} of acne vulgaris, but no single technique has been universally accepted as the diagnostic standard.

The Leeds acne <b>grading</b> technique counts acne lesions on the face, back, and chest and categorizes them as inflammatory or non-inflammatory.
