Ventilation 1. Install thermostats to control fans so they are on when needed and shut off when not needed.

40|$|Axial {{air flow}} fans {{are widely used}} for air movement. In an {{increasingly}} international and competitive market, smaller fan companies find themselves in need of rapid preliminary design. This need is addressed in this study {{through the development of}} a first-revision, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based, optimisation tool which allows for rapid prototyping of a ducted axial fan. The result is an ElementalTM-based multi-disciplinary software tool, comprising 2 D CFD, mesh movement, and constrained geometric optimisation. The analytical equation employed to represent the aerofoil significantly reduces the cost of the optimisation. A pseudo- 3 D fan model is generated by superimposing 2 D CFD results. This is done without the general assumption of the free-vortex method, which is not a necessity for fan design and other velocity distributions may be used. For this purpose, an enhanced finite volume discretisation method was developed. A penalty function minimisation, by means of an unconstrained optimisation algorithm, is implemented thereafter. The primary objective is to deliver a specific fan static pressure rise, while optimising for <b>fan</b> static <b>efficiency</b> by means of altering the rotor blade geometry. The spherical quadratic steepest descent method is employed, which does not rely on any explicit line searches, as required by traditional steepest descent techniques. The rapid prototyping tool is finally applied to an under-performing base fan (Fan-D) which cannot meet a specified duty point. The resulting optimised fan (Fan-Optim) is manufactured and experimentally tested, in accordance with the ISO 5801 standard. The pseudo- 3 D model is proven to predict fan performance accurately at the target duty point, while capturing fan behaviour over a range of volumetric flow rates. The former is to within 13 % of the fan static pressure rise and within 2. 3 % of <b>fan</b> static <b>efficiency.</b> While Fan-Optim meets the desired duty point within 2 %, it offers a considerable improvement in <b>fan</b> static <b>efficiency</b> over Fan-D.

Rotating fans are widely utilized in thermal management applications and their accurate characterization has recently become even a more critical issue for thermofluids engineers.

Using the three-dimensional CAD models of the fan, a series of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed to determine the flow and pressure fields produced by the axial mover over a range of flow rates. In order to validate the computational model findings, experiments were conducted to obtain the pressure drop values at different flow rates in an AMCA (Air Movement and Control Association) standard 210 - 99, 1999 wind tunnel.
