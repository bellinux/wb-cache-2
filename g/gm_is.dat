40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{characterize}} the microstructure {{and the performance of}} gelatin microspheres (GMs) cross-linked by two different cross-linkers viz. d-glucose and glutaraldehyde. New formulations were obtained, suspending the GMs in a thermoreversible Pluronic F 127 (PF 127) liquid-crystalline gel. Lysozyme was used as a model biomacromolecular drug to evaluate release features. Both types of cross-linked <b>GMs</b> <b>were</b> prepared by thermal gelation method. The lysozyme-loaded microspheres were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for size distribution, shape, and surface texture. SEM revealed that both types of lysozyme-loaded <b>GMs</b> <b>were</b> spherical in shape and that the surface of glutaraldehyde cross-linked <b>GMs</b> <b>was</b> smoother than that of the glucose cross-linked GMs. The degree of cross-linking of microspheres was investigated using ATR-FTIR technique.

SAXS study of the PF 127 gel confirmed the occurrence of a discrete cubic liquid-crystalline phase of the Fm 3 m type whose lattice parameter slightly decreased as a result of GMs addition. The in vitro release of lysozyme from both types of cross-linked <b>GMs</b> <b>was</b> successfully controlled when they were suspended in PF 127 gel, thus suggesting the potential use of this new combined formulation as a drug-depot system...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{ascertain}} whether specific abnormalities (ie, cramped synchronized general movements [GMs]) can predict cerebral palsy and {{the severity of}} later motor impairment in preterm infants affected by brain lesions. Design: Traditional neurological examination <b>was</b> performed, and <b>GMs</b> <b>were</b> serially videotaped and blindly observed for 84 preterm infants with ultrasound abnormalities from birth until 56 to 60 weeks' postmenstrual age, The developmental course of <b>GM</b> abnormalities <b>was</b> compared with brain ultrasound findings alone and with findings from neurological examination, {{in relation to the}} patient's outcome at age 2 to 3 years. Results: Infants with consistent or predominant (33 cases) cramped synchronized GMs developed cerebral palsy.
