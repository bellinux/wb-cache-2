40|$|Aerosol {{particle}} number concentrations have been measured at Halley and Neumayer on the Antarctic coast, since 2004 and 1984 respectively. Sulphur compounds {{known to be}} implicated in particle formation and growth were independently measured: sulphate ions and methane sulphonic acid in filtered aerosol samples; and gas-phase di-methyl sulphide for limited periods. Iodine oxide, IO, was determined by a satellite sensor from 2003 to 2009, and by different ground-based sensors at Halley in 2004 and in 2007. Previous model results and mid-latitude observations show that iodine compounds consistent with the large values of IO observed {{may be responsible for}} an incresase in number concentrations of small particles. Coastal Antarctica is useful for investigating correlations between particles, sulphur and iodine compounds, because of their large annual cycles and the source of iodine compounds in sea ice. After smoothing all the measured data by several days, the shapes of the annual cycles in particle concentration at Halley and at Neumayer are approximated by linear combinations of the shapes of sulphur compounds and IO, but not by sulphur compounds alone. However, there is no short-term correlation between IO and particle concentration. The apparent correlation by eye after smoothing but not in the short term suggests that iodine compounds and particles are sourced some distance offshore. This suggests that new particles formed from iodine compounds are viable, i. e. they can last long enough to grow to the larger particles that contribute to Cloud Condensation Nuclei, rather than being simply collected by existing particles. If so there is significant potential for climate feedback near the sea <b>ice</b> <b>zone</b> <b>via</b> the aerosol indirect effect...|$|R

40|$|An {{ecological}} {{model to}} calculate phytoplankton development and microbial loop dynamics in the marginal <b>ice</b> <b>zone</b> {{of the antarctic}} ecosystem has been established {{on the basis of}} physical and biological (phyto- and bacterioplankton biomass and activity and counting of two classes of heterotrophic nanoplankton) measurements carried out in the marginal <b>ice</b> <b>zone</b> of the Scotia-Weddell Sea sector of the Southern Ocean during sea ice retreat 1988 (EPOS 1 and 2 expeditions). Application of this model at latitudes where sea ice retreat occurs and in adjacent open sea and permanently ice-covered areas demonstrated that the marginal <b>ice</b> <b>zone</b> is a region of enhanced primary and bacterioplankton production. Combining the results of the phyto- and bacterioplankton models allowed the quantitative estimate of the carbon fluxes through the lower level of the planktonic food web of the Weddell Sea marginal <b>ice</b> <b>zone</b> during the sea ice retreat period. The resulting carbon budget revealed the quantitative importance of microbial and micrograzing processes in the pathways of net primary production, 71 % of this latter being assimilated in the microbial food web. However, total net microbial food web secondary production contributed 28 % of‘marginal <b>ice</b> <b>zone</b> produced’ food resources available to krill and other Zooplankton.

40|$|Antarctic Sea Ice Processes and Climate (ASPeCt) visual ship-based {{observations}} {{were conducted in}} the Bellingshausen Sea during the Sea Ice Mass Balance in the Antarctic (SIMBA) cruise in austral spring 2007. A total of 59 ASPeCt observations are compared to coincident satellite active and passive microwave data. Envisat and RADARSAT- 1 C-Band HH-polarization radar backscatter values (called NRCS henceforth) are derived on km-scales for six individual ice types and ice type mixtures. C-Band HH-polarized and Ku-Band VV-polarized NRCS are extracted on several 10 km-scale areas from coincident Envisat, RADARSAT- 1, and QuikSCAT radar images for areas primarily covered with multiyear, deformed first-year, and undeformed young ice, as well as ice of the marginal <b>ice</b> <b>zone</b> (MIZ). The C-Band NRCS permits distinction between first-year, MIZ, and undeformed young ice. However, NRCS of the multiyear <b>ice</b> <b>zone</b> overlaps {{with that of the}} other <b>ice</b> <b>zones</b> and types. Ku-Band NRCS obtained for the same ice types permits discrimination of the first-year <b>ice</b> <b>zone</b> only. Obtained NRCS agree with those of previous studies and suggest a high degree of deformation and considerable potential for flooding for the first-year ice case. In comparison to large scale NRCS, AMSR-E snow depth values form two clearly separated clusters, one for 0. 24 – 0. 35 m depth (first-year <b>ice</b> <b>zone)</b> and one for 0. 36 – 0. 54 m depth (multiyear <b>ice</b> <b>zone).</b> However, a comparison to ASPeCt observations suggests a remarkable underestimation of the snow depth by AMSR-E in the multiyear–first-year-ice transition zone and for first-year cake ice. Nevertheless, a fusion of the coarse AMSR-E snow depth ranges for interior pack ice regions with radar imagery at large scale, appears promising for mapping the major zones (MIZ and Pack Ice) and ice types (first-year and multiyear) of Antarctic sea ice on a circumpolar basis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{importance}} of {{waves in the}} Arctic Ocean has increased with the significant retreat of the seasonal sea-ice extent. Here, we use wind, wave, turbulence, and ice measurements to evaluate {{the response of the}} ocean surface to a given wind stress within the marginal <b>ice</b> <b>zone,</b> with a focus on the local wind input to waves and subsequent ocean surface turbulence. Observations are from the Beaufort Sea in the summer and early fall of 2014, with fractional ice cover of up to 50 %. Observations showed strong damping and scattering of short waves, which, in turn, decreased the wind energy input to waves. Near-surface turbulent dissipation rates were also greatly reduced in partial ice cover. The reductions in waves and turbulence were balanced, suggesting that a wind-wave equilibrium is maintained in the marginal <b>ice</b> <b>zone,</b> though at levels much less than in open water. These results suggest that air-sea interactions are suppressed in the marginal <b>ice</b> <b>zone</b> relative to open ocean conditions at a given wind forcing, and this suppression may act as a feedback mechanism in expanding a persistent marginal <b>ice</b> <b>zone</b> throughout the Arctic...|$|R

The 92 GHz {{portion of the}} radiometer was used to gather ice signature data and to generate real-time millimeter wave images of the marginal <b>ice</b> <b>zone.</b> Dry atmospheric conditions in the Arctic resulted in good surface ice signature data for the 183 GHz double sideband (DSB) channel situated + or - 8. 75 GHz away from the water vapor absorption line. The radiometer's beam scanner imaged the marginal <b>ice</b> <b>zone</b> over a + or - 45 degrees swath angle about the aircraft nadir position. The aircraft altitude was 30, 000 feet (9. 20 km) maximum and 3, 000 feet (0. 92 km) minimum during the various data runs. Calculations of the minimum detectable target (ice) size for the radiometer {{as a function of}} aircraft altitude were performed. In addition, the change in the atmospheric attenuation at 92 GHz under varying weather conditions was incorporated into the target size calculations.

Conversely, during periods of weak atmospheric forcing, the ice edge became diffuse and the ice edge morphology was determined by a variety of oceanic circulations.

50|$|Sea ice can be {{classified}} according {{to whether or not}} it is attached (or frozen) to the shoreline (or between shoals or to grounded icebergs). If attached, it is called landfast ice, or more often, fast ice (from fastened). Alternatively, and unlike fast ice, drift ice occurs further offshore in very wide areas, and encompasses ice that is free to move with currents and winds. The physical boundary between fast ice and drift ice is the fast ice boundary. The drift <b>ice</b> <b>zone</b> may be further divided into a shear <b>zone,</b> a marginal <b>ice</b> <b>zone</b> and a central pack. Drift ice consists of floes, individual pieces of sea ice 20 m or more across. There are names for various floe sizes: small - 20 m to 100 m; medium - 100 m to 500 m; big - 500 m to 2000 m; vast - 2 km to 10 km; and giant - more than 10 km. The term pack ice is used either as a synonym to drift ice, or to designate drift <b>ice</b> <b>zone</b> in which the floes are densely packed.

Chemical changes along the ice core seem {{to be linked to}} changes in the concentration of the ice cover in the marginal <b>ice</b> <b>zone.</b> In the period since 1956, these variations appear to be coupled to the atmospheric circulation, as indexed by the atmospheric pressure gradient across the marginal <b>ice</b> <b>zone.</b> The largest anomaly in the 200 -year sequence occurs in the period 1820 - 1880, during the final stages of the Little Ice Age.

40|$|Ice-edge-related {{phytoplankton}} blooms {{following the}} retreating sea-ice in the marginal <b>ice</b> <b>zone</b> are frequently observed phenomena. Such blooms are generally short-lived and {{are followed by}} a strong decrease in the chlorophyll concentration towards the open ocean, generally explained by the degradation of the vertical stability. Solar heating and ice melting, which control {{the stability of the}} surface water of the north-western Weddell Sea during sea-ice retreat in spring were analysed in order to relate the spatial features of the phytoplankton ice-edge bloom in 1988 to the density field.

40|$|Despite {{concerns}} about rapid changes in Arctic Ocean physical forcing and ecosystem function, quantitative knowledge and time series are scarce. The number of reliable physical-biological coupled models and models based on remote sensing is small. To improve our comprehension of carbon flux {{in the most}} prominent Arctic Ocean feature, the seasonal <b>ice</b> <b>zone,</b> a possible {{first step is to}} evaluate how biogeochemical cycling might develop in the future by examining conceptual models that address climate warming and seasonality in ecosystem development. Here we present three conceptual models of biogeochemical cycling and climate warming in the seasonal <b>ice</b> <b>zone</b> of the Arctic Ocean. They are designed to enhance, in a conceptual and semiquantitative manner, understanding of the possible temporal sequence of future primary production development, its spatial variation, and food availability in the most productive part of the future Arctic Ocean, including pelagic-benthic coupling. We speculate that the largest changes will take place in (a) the northern portions of today’s seasonal <b>ice</b> <b>zone,</b> which will expand to cover the entire Arctic Ocean, and (b) the southern portions, which will be exposed to more thermal stratification. The former change increases and the latter change decreases productivity and supply to the bottom. Lack of nutrient availability means that new production in the central Arctic Ocean will remain low. Blooms of ice and plankton algae may start earlier, depending on snow cover, providing more continuity in food supply for grazers in the upper water column. Weakening of today’s highly episodic primary production in the seasonal <b>ice</b> <b>zone</b> will result in lower average food concentrations for pelagic heterotrophs. We suggest that more of the available energy will be recycled in the pelagic zone, and that vertical export of biogenic matter will be less variable and of reduced quality...|$|R
