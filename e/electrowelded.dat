Panels were subjected to diagonal compression tests up to collapse. The test results were compared with other experiments recently carried out on masonry panels reinforced with CFRP attached directly to the masonry (fabric and metal foils). Finally, the research highlights the re-calibration of the calculus algorithm already presented in the literature for evaluating the shear strength of masonry {{in the presence of}} FRP reinforcement. 7 refs...|$|E

The automatic module is built with a structure of 10  ×  10  mm square section steel bars with <b>electrowelded</b> joints, which allows us to place the necessary trays and supports for the mechanical elements that give mobility to the leaning roof. As outer coating, panels of 2 -mm-thick galvanized sheet {{have been placed in}} both walls and the sliding roof. The roof of the observatory has been designed with a double leaning slope whose opening and closing are done in an opposed and synchronized way (Fig.  2).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an adaptation of}} the Integral Masonry System (IMS) developed in Europe under the trade name of the “AllWall System”, for adobe without mortar or hollow clay masonry walls with mortar, {{in order to allow}} the construction of housing in developing seismic areas. The prefabricated galvanized <b>electrowelded</b> wire truss-reinforcement is employed in the IMS. This truss-reinforcement may intersect in the three spatial directions and allows the construction of reinforced walls and slabs with these very lightweight and manageable components. These only require infilling with block masonry to provide sufficient rigidity to the structure. A two-storey 3 m x 3 m x 3 m adobe based integral masonry system has been tested on a seismic plate at one half scale at the PUCP (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Peru) in Lima (2008) in collaboration with the UPM (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid) in order to assure the viability of this new type of building construction for seismic areas. A similar test has also been done with hollow brick in 2009, with the same Universities colaboration. The comparation of the results of these tests (at 0. 5 scale of a 6 m x 6 m x 6 m building) have shown that the Earthquake - Integral Masonry System remains stable without significant cracking in adobe (2008) and without any cracks in hollow brick (2009...|$|E

Regarding to the specific properties of the welded material especially its quite high hardness and fragility, it has been proposed that when joining intermetallic Fe 3 Al advisable would be welding in an argon cover with using Es 9 CrNiB electrode optionally <b>electrowelding</b> with Es 9 CrNiB electrode.

Kirilyuk Odessa National Medical University, Odessa Abstract Introduction of suture less electro sealing technologies, made its wide use in non-invasive thoracic surgery. Most important use of these methods was seen in performing video thoracoscopic lung resections (VTLR). The aim of the work - to access possibilities of different methods of electro sealing VTLR. Videothoracoscopic wedge resection was performed in 142 patients with different surgical pathologies of chest. Out of which 103 operations were closed methods and 39 were video-assisted. Suture less VTLR were performed with the use of electro sealing complexes: EK- 300 M 1, “LigaSure Valleylab” and electrosurgical instruments. Few patients with suture less methods were additionally sealed with mechanical sutures by using end staplers and traditional stitching apparatus. All the examined patient were discharged from the hospital. Average hospital stay was 7. 8 days. Complications were seen in 7. 7 % cases. Lethality was not registered. High efficiency of VTLR for the diagnosis and treatment of solitary and disseminated lung processes of unknown etiologist and pneumothorax. No evidence in the results and effectiveness of EK 300 M 1 and LigaSure Valleylab in closed and video assisted methods. Criteria for the possibilities of combinations of suture less and mechanical suture in VTLR. Use of VTLR aloe us to minimize the cost of the operation. In the hospital, these methods can be used in closed and video assisted methods in VTLR, but needs further endoscopic electrosealing instruments.
