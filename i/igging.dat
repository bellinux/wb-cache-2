40|$|Immunoglobulin (<b>Ig)</b> antigen receptors are {{composed}} of a noncovalently- associated complex of <b>Ig</b> and two other proteins, <b>Ig</b> alpha and <b>Ig</b> beta. The cytoplasmic domain of both of these <b>Ig</b> associated proteins contains a consensus sequence that is shared with the signaling proteins of the T cell and Fc receptor. To test the idea that <b>Ig</b> alpha-Ig beta heterodimers are the signaling components of the <b>Ig</b> receptor, we have studied <b>Ig</b> mutations that interfere with signal transduction. We find that specific mutations in the transmembrane domain of <b>Ig</b> that inactivate Ca 2 + and phosphorylation responses also uncouple IgM from <b>Ig</b> alpha-Ig beta. These results define amino acid residues that are essential for the assembly of the <b>Ig</b> receptor. Further, receptor activity can be fully reconstituted in Ca 2 + flux and phosphorylation assays by fusing the cytoplasmic domain of <b>Ig</b> alpha with the mutant <b>Igs.</b> In contrast, fusion of the cytoplasmic domain of <b>Ig</b> beta to the inactive <b>Ig</b> reconstitutes only Ca 2 + responses. Thus, <b>Ig</b> alpha and <b>Ig</b> beta are both necessary and sufficient to mediate signal transduction by the <b>Ig</b> receptor in B cells. In addition, our results suggest that <b>Ig</b> alpha and <b>Ig</b> beta can activate different signaling pathways...|$|R

40|$|Re-arrangement and {{expression}} of the immunoglobulin (<b>Ig)</b> genes in B cells occurs under an ordered developmental control. The sequential model of <b>Ig</b> light chain exclusion predicts that only after non-productive re-organization or deletion of both <b>Ig</b> kappa alleles would re-arrangement of <b>Ig</b> lambda gene segments occur. To prove this model, we asked whether expression of <b>Ig</b> lambda light chains is always associated with rearrangement and/or deletion of both <b>Ig</b> kappa alleles in human cells. Therefore, we established human diploid B-cell clones in vitro that produce <b>Ig</b> lambda light chains. Southern blot analysis of the <b>Ig</b> kappa alleles revealed that three <b>Ig</b> lambda expressing cell lines (out of six <b>Ig</b> lambda+ cell lines tested) harbour one <b>Ig</b> kappa allele in germline configuration.

40|$|Precursor-B cells {{develop in}} bone marrow (BM) from hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) with the {{ultimate}} goal to generate mature B-cells with unique immunoglobulins (<b>Ig),</b> whereby all B cells together provide an enormous <b>Ig</b> repertoire diversity. Formation of the <b>Ig</b> occurs through somatic V(D) J recombination of the <b>Ig</b> heavy chain (IGH) and the <b>Ig</b> light chain (IGK or IGL) loci that contain multiple variable (V), diverse (D) and joining (J) coding elements. The <b>Ig</b> loci recombine in a ordered manner. The IGH locus rearranges before the <b>Ig</b> light chain loci and functional <b>Ig</b> rearrangements are generally restricted to one allele. Thus, the ordered accessibility of <b>Ig</b> loci for rearrangements is tightly controlled. Studies described in this thesis aimed {{to better understand the}} mechanisms underlying the stage-specific regulation of V(D) J recombination and the generation of a diverse <b>Ig</b> repertoire during precursor-B-cell development. The stepwise V(D) J recombination process is controlled by transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms which must cooperate together to provide the developmental increase in <b>Ig</b> loci accessibility for rearrangement. The formation of the broad <b>Ig</b> repertoire is dependent on the B-cell developmental niche. The BM niche undergoes physiological changes during life and therefore provides different signals to developing B cells, resulting in distinct <b>Ig</b> gene repertoires with distinct reactivity.

The immunoglobulins of eggs were purified by affinity chromatography on protein A-sepharose. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis showed reactivity of the antiserum Pab 1 with the <b>Ig</b> heavy and light chains, and some degradation products. This purification process yielded detectable amounts of <b>Ig.</b> The sex-related increase of serum <b>Ig</b> during the reproductive period, and the detection of <b>Ig</b> in eggs suggest a transfer of <b>Ig</b> from the blood of the adult female...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe neural cell {{adhesion}} molecule (NCAM) {{plays an important role}} in nervous system development. NCAM forms a complex between its terminal domains <b>Ig</b> 1 and <b>Ig</b> 2. When NCAM of cell A and of cell B connect to each other through complexes <b>Ig</b> 12 (A) /Ig 12 (B), the relative mobility of cells A and B and membrane tension exerts a force on the <b>Ig</b> 12 (A) /Ig 12 (B) complex. In this study, we investigated the response of the complex to force, using steered molecular dynamics. Starting from the structure of the complex from the <b>Ig</b> 1 -Ig 2 -Ig 3 fragment, we first demonstrated that the complex, which differs in dimensions from a previous structure from the <b>Ig</b> 1 -Ig 2 fragment in the crystal environment, assumes the same extension when equilibrated in solvent. We then showed that, when the <b>Ig</b> 12 (A) /Ig 12 (B) complex is pulled apart with forces 30 – 70 pN, it exhibits elastic behavior (with a spring constant of ∼ 0. 03 N/m) because of the relative reorientation of domains <b>Ig</b> 1 and <b>Ig</b> 2. At higher forces, the complex ruptures; i. e., <b>Ig</b> 12 (A) and <b>Ig</b> 12 (B) separate. The interfacial interactions between <b>Ig</b> 12 (A) and <b>Ig</b> 12 (B), monitored throughout elastic extension and rupture, identify E 16, F 19, K 98, and L 175 as key side chains stabilizing the complex...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "GAO has supported the creation of independent inspector general (<b>IG)</b> offices in appropriate federal departments, agencies, and entities through the Inspector General Act of 1978. Under the act, the Export-Import Bank {{is not required to}} have <b>IG</b> offices but must report its annual audit and investigative activity to both the Office of Management and Budget and Congress. <b>IG</b> oversight of the Export-Import Bank could be established in several ways. First, the <b>IG</b> Act could be amended to establish an <b>IG</b> appointed either by the President or by the Export-Import Bank Chairman. Also, an already existing <b>IG</b> office could provide independent audits and investigations of the bank. Finally, a memorandum of understanding, which acts as a contract for outside <b>IG</b> services and would not require an amendment to the <b>IG</b> Act, could be created. In the final analysis, the placement of <b>IGs</b> in specific agencies is a policy decision to be decided by Congress. ...|$|R
40|$|In mature B cells, signals transduced through {{membrane}} immunoglobulin (<b>Ig)</b> produce cellular activation, yet {{the same}} receptor can also mediate deletion and silencing of autoreactive B cells. In addition, <b>Ig</b> expression during the antigen-independent phase of B cell development regulates the precursor B (pre-B) cell transition and allelic exclusion. To {{account for the}} diverse regulatory functions induced by membrane <b>Ig,</b> it has been proposed that individual receptor components have independent physiologic activities. Here we establish a role for <b>Ig</b> alpha in the pre-B cell transition and allelic exclusion. We find that the cytoplasmic domain of <b>Ig</b> alpha contains sufficient information to trigger both of these antigen-independent events. Direct comparisons of the cytoplasmic domains of <b>Ig</b> alpha and <b>Ig</b> beta show that the two are indistinguishable in the induction of the pre-B cell transition and allelic exclusion. Our experiments suggest that, despite the reported differences in certain biochemical assays, <b>Ig</b> alpha and <b>Ig</b> beta have redundant functions in the developing B cell...|$|R
40|$|Immunoglobulin {{light chain}} (IgL) rearrangements occur more {{frequently}} at <b>Ig</b> � than at Ig�. Previous results {{suggested that the}} unrearranged <b>Ig</b> � locus negatively regulates <b>Ig</b> � transcription and/or rearrangement. Here, we demonstrate that expression of a VJ� 1 -joint inserted into its physiological position in the <b>Ig</b> � locus is independent of <b>Ig</b> � rearrangements. Expression of the inserted VJ� 1 gene segment is developmentally controlled {{like that of a}} VJ�-joint inserted into the <b>Ig</b> � locus and furthermore coincides developmentally with the occurrence of <b>Ig</b> � rearrangements in wild-type mice. We conclude that developmentally controlled transcription of a gene rearrangement in the <b>Ig</b> � locus occurs in the presence of an unrearranged <b>Ig</b> � locus and is therefore not negatively regulated by the latter. Our data also indicate light chain editing in � 30 % of � 1 expressing B cell progenitors. Key words: gene rearrangement • B lymphocyte • light chain • receptor editing • developmen...|$|R
