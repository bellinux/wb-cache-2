25|$|Eddington is {{approximately}} 13 metres above sea level, lying above mainly London Clay with some head Brickearth next to Plenty Brook; however {{to the east}} this changes to Tertiary deposits of the Thanet, Oldhaven and Woolwich beds. Its northern boundary is the railway line, and its southern edge includes the Thanet Way and Herne Bay cemetery. At its western limit is Eddington Business Park and its eastern sector contains part of Eddington Conservation Area. This conservation area includes {{a small portion of}} the north-west of Herne and Broomfield parish, known locally as the Links. Herne Bay Golf Club is in the south of Eddington. Herne Bay Golf Club closed sometime during between 2011 and 2016 and has since been transformed into yet another housing estate. Eddington Business Park contains Herne Bay <b>Delivery</b> <b>Office</b> for the Royal Mail. Herne bay delivery and sorting office closed in 2016 and is now a children's soft play area. In the past, parts of Eddington have been susceptible to flooding from Plenty Brook and the Council has recommended the construction of upstream storage lagoons near Herne Bay Golf Course besides other measures.|$|E

Until 2017, the {{main post office}} was located on Chilwell Road (on a site that also {{originally}} housed the <b>delivery</b> <b>office),</b> but was relocated to share premises with the town's branch of WHSmith. [...] Another post office is situated on High Road (towards Broadgate), with a third on Central Avenue {{in the northern part}} of the town.

50|$|The {{last two}} digits {{represent}} the <b>delivery</b> <b>office</b> within the sorting district starting from 01 {{which would be}} the GPO or HO. The numbering of the <b>delivery</b> <b>office</b> is done chronologically with higher numbers assigned to newer delivery offices. If the volume of mails handled at a <b>delivery</b> <b>office</b> is too large, a new <b>delivery</b> <b>office</b> is created and the next available PIN is assigned. Thus two delivery offices situated next to each other will only have the first four digits in common.|$|E

On {{inception}} (in 1857/8) it {{was divided into}} ten postal districts: EC (East Central), WC (West Central), N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW. The S and NE sectors were later abolished. In 1917, as a wartime measure to improve efficiency, these were subdivided with a number applied to each sub-district, with the area served directly by the district head office as [...] "1" [...] with the others allocated alphabetically by <b>delivery</b> <b>office,</b> leading to N2 East Finchley <b>delivery</b> <b>office,</b> N3 Finchley <b>delivery</b> <b>office,</b> N4 Finsbury Park <b>delivery</b> <b>office.</b> These divisions changed little, usually only changed for operational efficiency.|$|E

As a consequence of exposure to competition, the local <b>delivery</b> <b>offices</b> were rationalised by introducing a new working concept called “Best Method”.

The findings emerge from a study performed during autumn 2001 at fifteen local <b>delivery</b> <b>offices</b> in different parts of Sweden. It was carried out by participant observation, 60 in-depth interviews and a questionnaire answered by 524 postal personnel. A number of factors related to a successful implementation process have been identified as vital, such as participation, local and central managerial support and local adaptation of a managerial tool. In order to arrive at a more participative approach, an infrastructure is suggested that will improve information flow and communication both horizontally and vertically in the organisation. This calls for further research activities, which are planned in a second phase...|$|R

50|$|As {{part of the}} sorting process, mail is {{collected}} from pillar boxes, Post Office branches and businesses, and brought to the local mail centre. The process {{is divided into two}} parts. The 'outward' sorting, identifies mail for delivery in the mail centre geographic area, which is retained and mail intended for other mail centres, which is dispatched. The 'inward' sorting forwards this mail to the relevant <b>delivery</b> <b>offices</b> within the mail centre area. The geographic area of the mail centre corresponds to one or more postcode areas.|$|R

40|$|The Swedish Post Office is {{undergoing}} large-scale restructuring, including outsourcing of the mail service division {{to an independent}} market driven organisation. As a consequence of exposure to competition, the local <b>delivery</b> <b>offices</b> were rationalised by introducing a new working concept called “Best Method”. It was a top-down change process that included downsizing the personnel, more standardisation of working and formalisation of delivery time. The changes have influenced the postmen’s working conditions in several ways and they perceive a greater workload. This paper aims to identify the {{factors that contribute to}} the increased workload and work intensification due to the rationalisation inherent in the new working concept. The findings emerge from an evaluative investigation conducted during autumn 2001 at fifteen local <b>delivery</b> <b>offices</b> in different parts of Sweden. It was carried out by an independent research team in industrial ergonomics through participant observation, 60 in-depth interviews and a questionnaire answered by 524 postal personnel, mainly postmen. Several factors contributing to the increased workload and work intensification have been identified, such as a faster work pace and greater physical workload, less flexibility for the individual, insufficient participation, shortcomings and contradictions in the new working concept, deficient strategic planning and systems thinking, and a somewhat indistinct organisational philosophy. Further research activities are now taking place and an intervention study is in the planning stage...|$|R
