25|$|At low frequencies, {{molecules}} in polar dielectrics are polarized by an applied electric field, which induces periodic rotations. For example, at the microwave frequency, the microwave field causes the periodic rotation of water molecules, sufficient to break hydrogen bonds.

50|$|Measurement of CD is also {{complicated}} by the fact that typical aqueous buffer systems often absorb in the range where structural features exhibit differential absorption of circularly polarized light. Phosphate, sulfate, carbonate, and acetate buffers are generally incompatible with CD unless made extremely dilute e.g. in the 10-50 mM range. The TRIS buffer system should be completely avoided when performing far-UV CD. Borate and Onium compounds are often used to establish the appropriate pH range for CD experiments.

50|$|Ultraviolet {{light can}} cause burns to skinand {{cataracts}} to the eyes. Ultraviolet is classified into near, medium and <b>far</b> <b>UV</b> according to energy, where near and medium ultraviolet are technically non-ionizing, but where all UV wavelengths can cause photochemical reactions {{that to some}} extent mimic ionization (including DNA damage and carcinogenesis). UV radiation above 10 eV (wavelength shorter than 125 nm) is considered ionizing. However, {{the rest of the}} UV spectrum from 3.1 eV (400 nm) to 10 eV, although technically non-ionizing, can produce photochemical reactions that are damaging to molecules by means other than simple heat. Since these reactions are often very similar to those caused by ionizing radiation, often the entire UV spectrum is considered to be equivalent to ionization radiation in its interaction with many systems (including biological systems).|$|E
50|$|For example, let us {{consider}} the quantum chromodynamics with Nf massless quarks. This theory has the flavor symmetry SU(Nf)L×SU(Nf)R×U(1)V (the axial U(1) symmetry is broken by the chiral anomaly or instantons so we do not include it). This flavor symmetry SU(Nf)L×SU(Nf)R×U(1)V becomes anomalous when the background gauge field is introduced. One may use either the degrees of freedom at the far IR (i.e. low energy limit) or the degrees of freedom at the <b>far</b> <b>UV</b> (i.e. high energy limit) in order to calculate the anomaly. In the former case one should only consider massless fermions or Nambu-Goldstone bosons which may be composite particles, while {{in the latter case}} one should only consider the elementary fermions of the underlying short-distance theory. In both cases, the answer must be the same. Indeed, in the case of QCD, the chiral symmetry breaking occurs and the Wess-Zumino-Witten tern for the Nambu-Goldstone bosons reproduces the anomaly.|$|E
