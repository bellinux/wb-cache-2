The total pre-campaign exhaust from the 150 VAV fume hoods monitored was 85,000 cubic feet/minute (CFM), and the post-campaign average 59,000 CFM.

50|$|Potential {{behavioral}} {{savings from}} VAV fume hoods are highest when fume hood density (number of fume hoods {{per square foot}} of lab space) is high. This is because fume hoods contribute to the achievement of lab spaces' required air exchange rates. Put another way, savings from closing fume hoods can only be achieved when <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> <b>exhaust</b> rates are greater than the air exchange rate needed to achieve the required ventilation rate in the lab room. For example, in a lab room with a required air exchange rate of 2000 cubic feet per minute (CFM), if that room has just one fume hood which vents air {{at a rate of}} 1000 square feet per minute, then closing the sash on the fume hood will simply cause the lab room's air handler to increase from 1000 CFM to 2000 CFM, thus resulting in no net reduction in air exhaust rates, and thus no net reduction in energy consumption.|$|E

This facility is mainly designed for teaching undergraduate microelectronic course leading to a Bachelor’s degree. With the construction of its “Micro Fabrication Cleanroom ” (MFC), KUKUM has set the vision to reverse our reliance on imported technologies, as well as spearhead and support human resources needed by our nation, {{at the same time}} promoting indigenous talents and professionals especially in the field of microelectronic engineering. The cleanroom is approximately 115 m 2 with cleanliness class from ISO Class 5 in the Yellow Room to ISO Class 8 in the Grey Area (Utility Chase). The cleanroom are equipped with distributed process gases such as purified nitrogen, oxygen and compressed dry air and 18. 0 MΩ ultra-pure water system supplied to the three <b>fume</b> <b>hoods.</b> <b>Exhaust</b> air from the <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> are <b>exhausted</b> to the laboratory scrubber system for treatment.

50|$|Before Koenigsberg"s solution, {{laboratory}} personnel routinely {{kept the}} <b>fume</b> <b>hood’s</b> access door wide open {{at all times}} whether they were actively working at it or not.

Koenigsberg's new approach would require employees to be trained to modify their workplace activities and simply keep the <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> door fully closed at all times, except when access to the hood’s interior work place was required. In addition, employees would now be instructed to limit the <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> access door opening to the half open position when operating the hood, and only raise it to the full open position when required.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} airflow motions and associated pollutant distributions in <b>fume</b> <b>hoods.</b> Currently, most <b>exhaust</b> <b>fume</b> <b>hoods</b> are designed to use an airflow induced by a fan at the top to remove pollutants. Ambient fluids are drawn, flowing toward the opening and subsequently turning to the outlet at the roof. Pollutants are supposedly captured by the airflow and brought out from the cupboard. The present numerical study based on the finite-volume method and the standard k–e turbulence model simulates flow patterns and pollutant distributions in an <b>exhaust</b> <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> with and without a manikin present. Subsequently, a push–pull air curtain technique is applied to a fume cupboard. To investigate the capturing performance of a push–pull fume cupboard, numerical approaches are used to simulate flow and concentration variations. Numerical results reveal that four characteristic flow modes exist for a variety of speed ratios of push–pull flows and openings. A concave curtain mode which has a fast pull flow and a weak push flow is suggested for the operation of a push–pull fume cup-board. According to ANSI-ASHRAE Standard 110 - 1995, the local concentration at the speci-fied point is < 0. 1 parts per million (p. p. m.). Meanwhile, we also examine concentration variations at 12 selected points in front of the sash, and all where the concentration is < 0. 1 p. p. m. A manikin is put in front of the sash to observe its effect. As a result, the flow and the concentration contours in a push–pull fume cupboard are not affected by a manikin. In terms of those predicted results, it turns out that a push–pull fume cupboard successfully captures pollutants and prevents an operator from breathing pollutants...|$|R

Laboratory <b>fume</b> <b>hoods</b> are considered an engineering control in the hierarchy of control and are ubiquitous in the modern laboratory. Protection offered by the <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> depends on whether it is performing according to its original design. This performance needs to be maintained {{for as long as the}} <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> is in use. Gaining a better understanding of this performance and the limitations of the <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> are essential in ensuring constant operator protection. No performance or measurement standard to which <b>fume</b> <b>hoods</b> need to comply exists in South Africa. The Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 (Act no. 85 of 1993) requires engineering controls to be evaluated every 24 months. The Act does not stipulate how such evaluations need to be conducted.

The second approach is placing “point-of-decision” reminder stickers on the hoods themselves, explaining that a closed <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> saves up to 50,000 lbs of CO2 a year. The third method is an incentive-based competition among three buildings that contain <b>fume</b> <b>hoods.</b> During the three-week competition, volunteers periodically audit the buildings’ <b>fume</b> <b>hoods,</b> noting the total number of inches each <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> has been left open.

40|$|When {{working with}} health-hazardous {{substances}} or unpleasant airborne pollutants, {{it is important}} to have ventilation systems that are designed and operated to protect persons working in the laboratory. In laboratory applications, the <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> is the most commonly used item of protective equipment. This thesis is concerned with the air-handling aspects of the protective function of laboratory <b>fume</b> <b>hoods.</b> In order to be certain that a laboratory <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> is providing adequate protection, so that users are not exposed to health-hazardous substances, it is necessary to check its performance. There are a number of ways of doing this, but the most commonly employed method for quantitative evaluation of <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> performance is to meter a tracer gas inside the <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> and measure the outward leakage with an IR analyser. Measurements presented in the thesis show that outward leakage from a <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> has a very rapid, pulsed characteristic. Since the IR analysers that are normally used when checking the performance of a <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> do not have sufficiently rapid response, this means that the recorded outward leakage does not fully reflect the actual leakage. In the thesis, theoretical relationships are presented that describe the inertia of IR analysers, and calculations for short-duration pulses and normal instrument time constants show that the gas concentration recorded by the instruments differ considerably from the true gas concentration. The thesis describes two methods of determining the actual characteristic of the outward leakage from a <b>fume</b> <b>hood.</b> One method is based on a derived relationship that estimates the true gas concentration on the basis of the recorded concentration. The other way of determining the actual outward leakage process is to use a newly developed instrument with negligible inertia. The measurements that were made with this instrument clearly show that the outward leakage from a <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> is pulsed, and that the pulses are of considerably shorter duration and have higher peak values than had previously been possible to record with traditional IR instruments. In the thesis, results are also presented from measurements with the aim of determining how fast the flow needs to be adjusted after the position of the hood sash is changed in order to prevent outward leakage. These measurements indicate that the air flow rate should be adjusted and stabilized within 3 - 4 seconds in order to avoid outward leakage. Further, in order to investigate whether flow variations in the exhaust air system could affect the performance of a <b>fume</b> <b>hood,</b> measurements were made in a test room. The results show that if there are oscillations in the exhaust air system while someone is in front of the <b>fume</b> <b>hood,</b> unstable air flow through the hood occurs, sufficient to create outward leakage...|$|R
