40|$|The Johannesburg Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance <b>in</b> <b>Customs</b> <b>Matters</b> as of 2003 is {{a crucial}} {{breakthrough}} and important legal tool {{for the implementation of}} risk analysis systems by customs authorities governed by the the World Customs Organization (WCO) around the globe. However it has not entered into force yet. Is this new legal tool failing early? The old Nairobi Convention from 1977 is outdated and has never been widely accepted. This paper addresses the need for mutual Customs assistance, a common legal basis and analyses the current situation. The author underlines the idea that the Johannesburg Convention recognises the increased global concern for the security and facilitation of the international trade supply chain, and that offences against customs law are prejudicial to the security of the Contracting Parties and their economic, commercial, fiscal, social, public health and cultural interests. It also recognises that the international exchange of information is an essential component of effective risk management and that such exchange of information should be based on clear legal provisions. The author also points out that though mutual customs ssistance is possible {{on the basis of the}} Nairobi Convention or on the basis of bilateral agreements and other binding or non-binding WCO and/or UN legal tools, the Johannesburg Convention would make things better, clearer and modern. In conclusion the author argues that in case the JC is not going to be ratified by most countries the overall aim of a more secure supply chain is about to fail due to administrational hindering and hesitating governments. The methods used during the study are analysis, synthesis, comparison, generalization, systematic and functional analysis. Also available in Russia...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. The {{adoption}} of the Southern African Development Community’s Protocol on Trade in 2000 by member states which was aimed at creating an effective free intra-trade environment, had failed to reduce trade barriers which are threatening to reverse the gains made from tariff liberalization [...] The protectionism {{in the form of}} non-tariff barriers constitutes the biggest factor affecting intra-trade in the region. The new economic environment which was expected to emerge with the {{adoption of}} the Trade Protocol over a decade ago has not taken place. Some of the commitments by member states to harmonise <b>customs</b> procedures, co-operation <b>in</b> <b>customs</b> <b>matters</b> and trade facilitation are yet to be achieved as the Protocol on Trade lacks the much needed legal force as some of its articles allow room for member states to derogate from their commitments. The main objective of this research study was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the Protocol on Trade in the elimination of non-tariff barriers within the Southern African Development Community Free Trade Area. In order to achieve this, the study analysed the trend of non-tariff barriers reported in the period 2008 to 2013, the cost of trading across member states borders and the trend of intra-regional trade from 1996 to 2013. The main research findings indicated that non-tariff barriers are on the increase with cumbersome customs procedures and poor infrastructure development proving to be more prevalent in the region. The Protocol failed to reduce the cost of trading across member states’ borders since it came into force in 2000 with the cost of importing and exporting on the increase and the trade documentation remaining high. Again, the level of intra-regional trade as a percentage decreased from 2000 to 2013 – an indication that the Protocol on Trade failed to facilitate trade in the region through the elimination of non-tariff barriers. However, considerable potential for intra-regional trade remains unexploited due to induced trade barriers which are hampering the development of much needed regional value chains...|$|R

Mr. Slope tried his hand at subverting the old-established customs of the close, and from his failure she had learnt experience.

The {{first part of the}} article discusses meaning in Scotland, focusing on ‘custom as normative practice, custom as unwritten law, and <b>custom</b> <b>in</b> opposition to law’. The second seeks to demonstrate (using evidence focusing principally on landholding) that custom as legal currency was more restricted for Scots than English. The third sets out the implications for continuity of landholding and for agrarian change in the Highlands of Scotland, an area where custom might be thought strong. The fourth deals with the differential legal development of Scotland and England between the twelfth and eighteenth centuries and its effects on social and tenurial relationships.
