40|$|A {{clinical}} {{evaluation of the}} Amplicor polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay {{for the detection of}} Chlamydia trachomatis in endocervical swabs (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, N. J.) is described. This new clinical system used one-step sample preparation, amplification with biotinylated cryptic plasmid primer pairs (CP 24 -CP 27), uracil-N-glycosylase (AmpErase), and a microtiter format for amplicon capture and detection. Culture with McCoy cells in duplicate 1 -dram (3. 697 -ml) vials with fluorescent immunostaining was the reference system. Endocervical swab samples from 945 women provided 74 culture-positive specimens, of which PCR detected 71. The initial PCR result was positive for 12 additional specimens. Arbitration of the PCR-positive, culture-negative samples by PCR with major outer membrane protein primers, <b>duplicate</b> <b>culture,</b> elementary body direct fluorescent-antibody staining, and DNA extraction PCR showed that all 12 samples were positive for chlamydia, raising the number of truly positive samples from 74 to 86. After arbitration the true sensitivities of PCR and culture were 96. 5 and 86 %, respectively (P = 0. 02). Specificities for both were 100 %. For PCR, the positive and negative predictive values were 100 and 99. 7 %, respectively. Total test efficiency was 99. 7 %. A high-test-volume (121 samples) timing study with all items included in the College of American Pathologists work load method indicated that this PCR format took approximately 3 min per sample. Because of the high sensitivity, specificity, and improved ease of handling, we found PCR to be a good alternative to culture for detection of C. trachomatis...|$|E

Complementary use of chloride and perchlorate data allowed the identification and rejection of poor quality data by applying mass and isotopic balance checks. This precise Delta Cl- 37 (Cl) [...] ClO 4 -, value can serve as a reference point for comparison with future in situ or microcosm studies but we also note its similarity to the theoretical equilibrium isotopic fractionation between a hypothetical chlorine species of redox state + 6 and perchlorate at 37 degrees C and suggest that the first electron transfer during perchlorate reduction may occur at isotopic equilibrium between art enzyme-bound chlorine and perchlorate.

40|$|Abstract Background Listeriosis is {{a severe}} {{infection}} which mainly affects pregnant women, neonates and immuno-compromised adults. ANSES’s Laboratory for Food safety {{has been the}} European Union Reference Laboratory (EURL) for L. monocytogenes in the food chain since 2006. Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) is routinely used in the EURL for the surveillance of L. monocytogenes isolated from foods, animals and the environment. One of the main EURL activities is to evaluate alternative molecular subtyping methods to PFGE, and integrate their use within the National Reference Laboratories (NRL) network. Since 2008, the United Kingdom (UK) -NRL for L. monocytogenes at the Health Protection Agency (HPA), London, has used fluorescent Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (fAFLP) for the routine surveillance of L. monocytogenes isolated from human clinical cases, food and food processing environments in the UK. This study compares fAFLP with PFGE for subtyping L. monocytogenes. Results A panel of 109 L. monocytogenes isolates from either human cases of listeriosis, foods, food processing environments and animals {{were used for the}} comparative evaluation. Among these, 2 strains were tested from <b>duplicate</b> <b>culture</b> by both methods. The panel also included field isolates, isolates associated with outbreaks or sporadic cases and reference strains. The two strains tested in duplicate displayed the same fAFLP and PFGE types. Strains known to be epidemiologically associated with one another were found to have unique PFGE and fAFLP types. FAFLP and PFGE divided the strains into 76 and 82 distinct profiles, or types, respectively. The discriminatory index calculated was 0. 993 and 0. 996 for fAFLP and PFGE, respectively. Conclusions The discriminatory ability of fAFLP was similar to that of PFGE for the subtyping of L. monocytogenes isolates. As a less labour intensive technique fAFLP may be a better method to use than PFGE in investigating outbreaks of human listeriosis and tracking the source of contamination in food processing facilities in real time. </p...|$|E
40|$|A new {{fingerprinting}} technique {{with the}} potential for rapid identification of bacteria was developed by combining proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H MRS) with multivariate statistical analysis.

Responses to phytohemagglutinin were {{compared with that of}} <b>duplicate</b> <b>cultures</b> containing penicillin-streptomycin, chloramphenicol, or no antibiotics. Possible effects of cephalosporins on responses of lymphocytes to concanavalin A and pokeweed mitogen were similarly determined. Significant suppression of responses to phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A were seen in cultures containing 50 microgram each of cephalothin, cephalexin, or cephradine per ml. Lymphocyte responses to pokeweed mitogen were suppressed by 50 microgram of cephalexin, cephradine, or cefoxitin per ml. A higher concentration (100 microgram/ml) of all cephalosporins except cefoxitin and cefazolin suppressed the phytohemagglutinin response to less than 20 % that of controls. Chloramphenicol (50 microgram/ml) did not inhibit the response to any mitogen used.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{established a}} role for the second messenger ceramide in protein kinase R (PKR) -mediated articular cartilage degradation. Ceramide is known to play a dual role in collagen gene regulation, with the effect of ceramide on collagen promoter activity being dependent on its concentration. Treatment of cells with low doses of sphingomyelinase produces small increases in endogenous ceramide. We investigated whether ceramide influences articular chondrocyte matrix homeostasis and, if so, the role of PKR in this process. Bovine articular chondrocytes were stimulated for 7 days with sphingomyelinase to increase endogenous levels of ceramide. To inhibit PKR, 2 -aminopurine was added to <b>duplicate</b> <b>cultures.</b> De novo sulphated glycosaminoglycan and collagen synthesis were measured by adding [35 S]-sulphate and [3 H]-proline to the media, respectively. Chondrocyte phenotype was investigated using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Over 7 days, sphingomyelinase increased the release of newly synthesized sulphated glycosaminoglycan and collagen into the media, whereas inhibition of PKR in sphingomyelinase-treated cells reduced the level of newly synthesized sulphated glycosaminoglycan and collagen. Sphingomyelinase treated chondrocytes expressed col 2 a 1 mRNA, which is indicative of a normal chondrocyte phenotype; however, {{a significant reduction in}} type II collagen protein was detected. Therefore, small increments in endogenous ceramide in chondrocytes appear to push the homeostatic balance toward extracellular matrix synthesis but {{at the expense of the}} chondrocytic phenotype, which was, in part, mediated by PKR...|$|R

To inhibit the activation of PKR, a pharmacological inhibitor of PKR was added to <b>duplicate</b> <b>cultures.</b> Pro- and active matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP 9) and MMP 9 mRNA were significantly upregulated by OSM+IL- 1 through a PKR dependent mechanism. ADAMTS 4 and ADAMTS 5 mRNA were also upregulated by OSM+IL- 1. The upregulation of ADAMTS 4 and ADAMTS 5 were, in part, mediated through PKR. OSM+IL- 1 resulted in a loss of type II collagen, which could not be rescued by PKR inhibition. OSM+IL- 1 reduced the expression of COL 2 A 1 (type II collagen), COL 9 A 1 (type IX collagen), COL 11 A 1 (type XI collagen), and ACAN (aggrecan) mRNAs. Expression of type II and XI collagen and aggrecan was reduced further when PKR was inhibited. OSM+IL- 1 resulted in an 11 -fold increase in TNFa mRNA which was, in part, mediated through the PKR pathway.

The results were subjected to computer analyses. Two of the cultures were discarded due to contamination. Thus the total number examined was 200. On the basis of groupings so obtained, representative strains from the numerical taxonomic study and some others were examined by serological and, or, chemical techniques. The serological technique used was agglutination. The chemical techniques included cell wall and lipid analyses, cytochrome investigations and estimation of % G+C base ratios. The results indicate that the genus Listeria comprises only two species, L. monocytogenes (including L. monocytogenes. "L. innocua" and "L. bulgarica") and L. gravi (including L. gravi and L. murrayi). Listeria denitrificans should be removed from the genus Listeria. The chemical studies in particular indicate a relationship between the genera Listeria and Brochothrix at the suprageneric level. The name Listeriaceae is proposed for this family. The atypical lactobacilli Group 1 of Thornley & Sharpe (1959) should be designated thermosphacta. The bacteria of Groups 2 and 3 of Thornley & Sharpe (1959) are distinct taxa but their exact taxonomic placement was not resolved in the present study.

A polymerase chain reaction product of the expected molecular size was generated and the identity was confirmed by sequence analysis. Western blotting of total melanocyte proteins reacted with an anti-intermediate chain cytoplasmic dynein antibody identified the appropriate 74 [*]kDa band. To determine whether cytoplasmic dynein {{plays a role in}} melanosome transport, <b>duplicate</b> <b>cultures</b> were treated with cytoplasmic dynein antisense or sense (control) oligodeoxynucleotides and the cells were observed by high-resolution time-lapse microscopy, which allows visualization of melanosomal aggregates and individual melanosomes. Antisense-treated melanocytes demonstrated a strong anterograde transport of melanosomes from the cell body into the dendrites, whereas melanosome distribution was not affected in sense-treated melanocytes. To determine whether ultraviolet irradiation modifies cytoplasmic dynein expression, melanocyte cultures were exposed to increasing doses of solar-simulated irradiation, equivalent to a mild to moderate sunburn exposure for intact skin. Within 24 [*]h, doses of 5 and 10 [*]mJ per cm 2 induced cytoplasmic dynein protein, whereas doses of 30 [*]mJ per cm 2 or more were associated with decreased levels of cytoplasmic dynein compared with sham-irradiated controls.

Bovine articular cartilage explants were stimulated with C 2 -ceramide or TNF-α for 24 hours. To inhibit the activation of PKR, 2 -aminopurine was added to <b>duplicate</b> <b>cultures.</b> Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and activation in the medium were analysed by gelatin zymography, proteoglycan release by the dimethylmethylene blue assay, and cell viability by the Cytotox 96 ® assay. C 2 -ceramide treatment of cartilage explants resulted in a significant release of both pro- and active MMP- 2 into the medium. Small increases were also seen with TNF-α treatment. Incubation of explants with 2 -aminopurine before TNF-α or C 2 -ceramide treatment resulted in a marked reduction in expression and activation of both MMP- 2 and MMP- 9. TNF-α and C 2 -ceramide significantly increased proteoglycan release into the medium, which was also inhibited by cotreatment with 2 -aminopurine. A loss of cell viability was observed when explants were treated with TNF-α and C 2 -ceramide, which was found to be regulated by PKR. We have shown that C 2 -ceramide and TNF-α treatment of articular cartilage result in the increased synthesis and activation of MMPs, increased release of proteoglycan, and increased cell death. These effects are abrogated by treatment with the PKR inhibitor 2 -aminopurine.

Materials and Methods High density monolayer cultures of full depth, bovine articular chondrocytes were treated with oncostatin-M (OSM; 10 ng/ml) and interleukin- 1 (IL- 1; 5 ng/ml) for 7 -days. To inhibit the activation of PKR, a pharmacological inhibitor of PKR (Calbiochem, 1 lM) was added to <b>duplicate</b> <b>cultures.</b> Media was analysed for MMPs (zymography) and cell extracts for type II collagen (Western blot) and gene expression (qPCR). Results Pro- and active MMP- 9 and MMP- 9 mRNA were significantly upregulated by OSM+IL- 1. The expression of MMP- 9 protein and mRNA was significantly reduced following PKR inhibition. The expression of ADAMTS- 4 and ADAMTS- 5 mRNA was upregulated significantly by OSM+IL- 1. This upregulation was, in part, mediated through PKR. Treatment of chondrocytes with OSM+IL- 1 resulted in {{a reduction in the}} amount of type II collagen detected, which could not be rescued by PKR inhibition. OSM+IL- 1 treatment significantly reduced the expression of type II, XI, and IX, collagen, aggrecan, and sox 9 mRNAs. Expression of these genes was reduced further when PKR was inhibited. OSM+IL- 1 treatment resulted in an 11 -fold increase in TNF-a mRNA which was, in part, mediated through the PKR pathway.

40|$|Wall {{turnover}} was {{studied in}} Bacillus subtilis. The loss of radioactively labeled wall polymers was followed during exponential growth in batch and chemostat cultures. Turnover kinetics were identical under all growth conditions; pulse-labeled wall material was lost with first-order kinetics, {{but only after}} exponential growth for 1 generation time after its incorporation. Similarly, continuously labeled cells showed an accelerating decrease in wall-bound radioactivity starting immediately after removal of the labeled precursor and also reached first-order kinetics after 1 generation time. A mathematical description was derived for these turnover kinetics, which embraced the concept of "spreading" of old wall chains (H. M. Pooley, J. Bacteriol. 125 : 1127 - 1138, 1976). Using this description, {{we were able to}} calculate from our experimental data the rate of loss of wall polymers from cells and the fraction of the wall which was sensitive to turnover. We found that about 20 % of the wall was lost per generation time and that this loss was affected by turnover activity located in the outer 20 to 45 % of the wall; rather large variations were found with both quantities and also between <b>duplicate</b> <b>cultures.</b> These parameters were quite independent of the growth rate (the specific growth rate varied from 1. 3 h- 1 in broth cultures to 0. 2 to 0. 3 h- 1 in chemostat cultures) and {{of the nature of the}} anionic polymer in the wall (which was teichoic acid in cultures with an excess of phosphate and teichuronic acid in phosphate-limited chemostat cultures).

40|$|The {{question}} {{of the relationship of}} streptococci to the etiology of infectious arthritis and of rheumatic fever is of the utmost importance. If a streptococcus or group of streptococci could be shown to be associated See PDF for Structure with either disease, some form of specific treatment might be available. The possibility of primary streptococcic infection as the cause of rheumatic fever, and, to a less extent, of acute infectious arthritis {{would seem to be a}} reasonable conjecture because of the frequency of associated throat, sinus or other focal infection. To consider that these same streptococci remain in or about the affected joint and to such an extent that they are found in the blood stream in cases of chronic infectious arthritis of years' duration demands a rather unique conception. Recent investigative work has certainly tended to confirm the importance of streptococci in these diseases, but, if all the published reports are considered as a group, one can not help being impressed with the inconsistency and peculiarities of the findings. In blood cultures from cases of rheumatic fever Clawson (7) recovered Streptococcus viridans, Small (8) and Birkhaug (9) non-hemolytic (gamma type) streptococci, and Cecil et al. (3) Streptococcus viridans, rarely hemolytic and non-hemolytic streptococci. In blood cultures from cases of infectious arthritis Cecil et al. (2) recovered attenuated hemolytic streptococci and occasionally Streptococcus viridans, non-hemolytic streptococci and diphtheroids and Margolis and Dorsey (10) green-producing and indifferent streptococci and diphtheroids, whereas from synovial fluids and regional lymph nodes Forkner, Shands and Poston (4) and Poston (5) obtained Streptococcus viridans and Margolis and Dorsey (11) recovered green-producing and indifferent streptococci and diphtheroids from epiphyseal marrows, bones and synovial membranes. On the other hand, Jordan (12) and Nye and Seegal (13) and the work reported in this paper have failed to confirm these findings. If a streptococcus is the infective agent, it is difficult to explain why the organisms recovered so consistently by certain groups of investigators are so different and why the findings of other groups are entirely negative. The chances of contamination, even with the most careful manipulation, are extremely favorable when using a cultural technique which demands subculturing a fluid medium every 3 to 5 days for a period of 4 to 6 weeks. The question arises as to what organisms should be considered as contaminants. Cultures found to contain Staphylococcus albus have never been judged significant. Margolis and Dorsey (11) have excluded Gram-positive bacilli from their series, but have included diphtheroids. Cecil et al. (2) reported the recovery of diphtheroids and Micrococcus zymogenes from blood cultures which they did not consider contaminated. Jordan (12) recovered short Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive bacilli and questioned their importance. The occurrence of such bacteria would appear to be not unlike that of the non-hemolytic (gamma type) streptococci reported by Small (7), Birkhaug (9) and, rarely, by Cecil et al. (2) and Margolis and Dorsey (10, 11). In the work reported in this paper and in previously published work (13) with blood cultures from cases of rheumatic fever, staphylococci, Gram-positive bacilli and diplococci and diphtheroids have been isolated from a certain number of the cultures. Since these were found, as a rule, in only 1 of 2 or more cultures from the same blood and since such organisms occurred about as frequently in cultures from control cases, they have been considered merely contaminants. The findings in the 9 cases of arthritis with positive blood cultures reported by Margolis and Dorsey (10) are certainly far from convincing. These authors found green-producing streptococci in 5 of the 9 cases, but <b>duplicate</b> <b>cultures</b> on the same blood, with one exception, were always negative and the two repeat cultures were negative. Furthermore, in the 3 cases yielding indifferent streptococci in one subculture all subsequent subcultures were negative. In the work reported in this paper a green-producing and a non-hemolytic streptococcus were isolated from blood cultures, but a Gram-positive diplococcus and a Gram-positive bacillus, respectively, were recovered from the same cultures. A consideration of the above would seem to point to the probability, even certainty, of streptococci occurring in some cultures as contaminants; and the work of Olitsky and Long (14) and Long, Olitsky and Stewart (15) has clearly demonstrated that the air contamination of cultures of ground material with non-hemolytic green-producing streptococci can occur just as easily as with diphtheroids and staphylococci. It is obvious, in such cases, that the types of organisms recovered are dependent on the flora of the air of the laboratory or of the throat of the laboratory worker, and this point may well explain the differences in the cultural findings under consideration. A number of years ago numerous articles (16 – 19) appeared relative to the bacteriologic flora of lymph nodes, particularly those from cases of Hodgkin's disease, and it is interesting to note that the organisms recovered were quite similar to those which have been recovered from the blood and tissues of cases of arthritis and rheumatic fever, with the exception that the diphtheroids were, at that time, much more in prominence. Regardless of elaborate serological studies and animal experiments, streptococci must be recovered consistently by several groups of laboratory workers before their etiologic rôle in chronic arthritis and rheumatic fever can be accepted. <b>Duplicate</b> <b>cultures</b> and repeat cultures should yield the same organism in a generous percentage of cases and cultures from cases of other diseases or from normal persons should be negative. Positive <b>cultures</b> from <b>duplicate</b> <b>cultures</b> opened only at the time when the first culture showed growth would make the findings more significant than if the whole series were subcultured every 3 to 5 days. The work of Cecil, Nicholls and Stainsby on the bacteriology of the blood and joints in chronic arthritis and rheumatic fever has apparently been carried out most carefully and thoroughly and their results are very consistent and convincing. In spite of attempts to follow their methods in the selection of patients and in cultural technique, the results on the relatively small series of cases which are reported here fail to confirm their findings...|$|R
30|$|In one {{series of}} experiments, Se was added as a stock {{solution}} of sodium selenite (Na 2 SeO 3) {{once a day}} to each cultivation column (250  µmol photons m− 2 s− 1) at various concentration (2.5, 8.5 and 25  mg Se per g of starting biomass density; representing final concentrations of about 19, 65 and 190  µmol L− 1, respectively) to determine effective concentration. In the other series of experiments, various light intensities (250, 500 and 750  µmol photons m− 2  s− 1, respectively) were used to study the irradiance-dependent effect of Se treatment (16  mg Se g− 1 biomass added twice a day as Na 2 SeO 3; final concentration of about 122  µmol L− 1).

Statistical analysis of the adjusted growth (cell. mL- 1) and biomass (µg chlorophyll-a. mL- 1) curves performed using the Chi-square test (p< 0. 05) demonstrated significant differences between the nutritive medium f/ 2 and the 40 % addition used for these two species. The results suggested that some of the concentrations tested here yielded satisfactory cell densities and growth rates when compared with other culture media (macroalgae, bovine and chicken manure extracts).

40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} and quantify the microorganisms present in a certain ecosystem, it has become necessary to develop molecular methods avoiding cultivation, which allows to characterize only the countable part of the microorganisms in the sample, therefore losing the information related to the microbial component which presents a vitality condition, although it cannot <b>duplicate</b> in <b>culture</b> medium. In this context, {{one of the most}} used techniques is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with ribosomal RNA targeted oligonucleotide probes. Owing to its speed and sensitivity, this technique is considered a powerful tool for phylogenetic, ecological, diagnostic and environmental studies in microbiology. Through the use of species-specific probes, it is possible to identify different microorganisms in complex microbial communities, thus providing a solid support to the understanding of interspecies interaction. The knowledge of the composition and distribution of microorganisms in natural habitats can be interesting for ecological reasons in microbial ecology, and for safety and technological aspects in food microbiology.

40|$|The neuron {{restrictive}} silencer factor (NRSF/REST) {{has been}} shown to bind to the promoters of many neuron-specific genes and is able to suppress transcription of Na(+) channels in PC 12 cells, although its functional effect in terminally differentiated neurons is unknown. We constructed lentiviral vectors to express NRSF as a bicistronic message with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and followed infected hippocampal neurons in culture over a period of 1 - 2 wk. NRSF-expressing neurons showed a time-dependent suppression of Na(+) channel function as measured by whole cell electrophysiology. Suppression was reversed or prevented by the addition of membrane-permeable cAMP analogues and enhanced by cAMP antagonists but not affected by increasing protein expression with a viral enhancer. Secondary effects, including altered sensitivity to glutamate and GABA and reduced outward K(+) currents, were <b>duplicated</b> by <b>culturing</b> GFP-infected control neurons in TTX. The striking similarity of the phenotypes makes NRSF potentially useful as a genetic "silencer" and also suggests avenues of further exploration that may elucidate the transcription factor's in vivo role in neuronal plasticity...|$|R
40|$|Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is cultured on {{large-scale}} {{to produce}} antigen for inactivated whole-cell vaccines against respiratory disease in pigs. However, the fastidious nutrient requirements of this minimal bacterium {{and the low}} growth rate make it challenging to reach sufficient biomass yield for antigen production. In this study, we sequenced the genome of M. hyopneumoniae strain 11 and constructed a high quality constraint-based genome-scale metabolic model of 284 chemical reactions and 298 metabolites. We validated the model with time-series data of <b>duplicate</b> fermentation <b>cultures</b> to aim for an integrated model describing the dynamic profiles measured in fermentations. The model predicted that 84 % of cellular energy in a standard M. hyopneumoniae cultivation was used for non-growth associated maintenance and only 16 % of cellular energy was used for growth and growth associated maintenance. Following a cycle of model-driven experimentation in dedicated fermentation experiments, {{we were able to}} increase the fraction of cellular energy used for growth through pyruvate addition to the medium. This increase in turn led to an increase in growth rate and a 2. 3 times increase in the total biomass concentration reached after 3 - 4 days of fermentation, enhancing the productivity of the overall process. The model presented provides a solid basis to understand and further improve M. hyopneumoniae fermentation processes. </p...|$|R

Dissimilatory Fe(III) -reducing bacteria, by reducing insoluble Fe(III) to soluble Fe(II), may enhance contaminant mobility through subsurface environments. In order to investigate populations of the indigenous iron-reducing microbes from the SRS, <b>duplicate</b> enrichment <b>cultures</b> were initiated using a 10 % inoculum of 7 sediment/soil samples, and serial dilutions were made into Wolfe’s minimal salts media amended with 50 mM Fe(III) floc, 10 mM acetate and 0. 01 % yeast extract. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis was used to generate fingerprints of the cultures and track changes in the microbial communities through the dilutions. Cluster analysis determined the relatedness of individual fingerprints. Initial enrichment cultures exhibited complex fingerprints consisting of many individual T-RF peaks, and demonstrated low similarity between sites. After four serial dilutions the fingerprints were less complex and clustered at higher similarities. Several individual T-RF peaks became dominant in a majority of the fingerprints. Cloning and sequence analysis revealed the presence of microbes closely related to Clostridium and Bacillus species and to known iron reducers such as Geobacter species and Pantoea agglomerans. Several Fe(III) -reducing isolates related to Aeromonas, Bacillus and Clostridium species were obtained...|$|R
40|$|At the Washington “ 2 nd International Workshop on Genotoxicity Testing” (25 – 26 March 1999) current methodologies {{and data}} for the in vitro {{micronucleus}} test were reviewed. As a result, guidelines {{for the conduct of}} specific aspects of the protocol were developed. Agreement was achieved on the following topics: choice of cells, slide preparation, analysis of micronuclei, toxicity, use of cytochalasin-B, number of doses, and treatment/harvest times [Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 35 (2000) 167]. Because {{there were a number of}} important in vitro micronucleus validation studies in progress, it was not possible to design a definitive, internationally harmonized protocol at that time. These studies have now been completed and the data were reviewed at the Plymouth “ 3 rd International Workshop on Genotoxicity Testing” (28 – 29 June 2002). Data from studies coordinated by the French Society of Genetic Toxicology, Japanese collaborative studies, European pharmaceutical industry validation studies, along with data from Lilly Research Laboratories were used to prepare conclusions on the main aspects of the in vitro micronucleus protocol. In this paper, the consensus agreements on the protocol for performing the in vitro micronucleus assay are presented. The major recommendations concern: 1. Demonstration of cell proliferation: both cell lines and lymphocytes can be used, but demonstration of cell proliferation in both control and treated cells is compulsory for the acceptance of the test. 2. Assessment of toxicity and dose range finding: assessment of toxicity should be performed by determining cell proliferation, e. g. increased cell counts (CC) or population doubling (PD) without cytochalasin-B, or e. g. cytokinesis-block proliferation index with cytochalasin-B; and by determining other markers for cytotoxicity (confluency, apoptosis, necrosis) which can provide valuable additional information. 3. Treatment schedules for cell lines and lymphocytes. 4. Choice of positive controls: without S 9 -mix both a clastogen (e. g. mitomycin C or bleomycin) and an aneugen (e. g. colchicine) should be included as positive controls and a clastogen that requires S 9 for activity when S 9 -mix is used (e. g. dimethylnitrosamine, or cyclophosphamide in those cell types that cannot activate this agent directly). 5. <b>Duplicate</b> <b>cultures</b> and number of cells to be scored. 6. Repeat experiments: in lymphocytes, for each experiment blood from 2 different healthy young and non-smoking donors should be compared. In cell lines, the experiments need only to be repeated if the first one is negative. 7. Statistics: statistical significance should not be the sole factor for determining positive results.

40|$|Down Syndrome (DS) {{is caused}} by the {{presence}} of three copies of the whole human chromosome 21 (HC 21) or of a HC 21 restricted region; the phenotype is likely to have originated from the altered expression of genes in the HC 21. We apply the cDNA microarray method to the study of gene expression in human T lymphocytes with trisomy 21 in comparison to normal cells. Two patients with DS were investigated, along with two normal subjects as a control, all being tested in independent, <b>duplicated</b> cell <b>culture</b> experiments. The most consistent finding was the overexpression of the superoxide dismutase gene (SOD 1), located on 21 q, and of MHC DR beta 3 (HLA-DRB 3), GABA receptor A gamma 2 (GABRG 2), acetyltransferase Coenzyme, A 2 (ACAT 2) and ras suppressor protein 1 (RSU 1) genes. When the data were clustered according to chromosome localization, the HC 21 gene set showed, on average, the highest expression in DS cells in all the experiments. Moreover, separate clustering of patients and controls was obtained when analysis was restricted to HC 21 gene expression values. These findings reinforce the specific gene dosage theory for the pathogenesis of the DS phenotype, and show a consistent overexpression of the SOD 1 gene on 21 q. © University College London 2004...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} and reproducibility of the quantitative direct plating (QDP) method and the semi-automated BACTEC radiometric system (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.) were analyzed for the rapid diagnosis of Haemophilus influenzae bacteremia {{on the basis}} of 41 positive cultures from 35 patients. The QDP method detected 61 % and BACTEC only 19 % of the positive cultures within the first 12 h. Similarly, the QDP procedure yielded growth of H. influenzae in 56 % of the cultures before a positive growth index reading was obtained with the BACTEC method. The observation that the quantitative procedure recovered H. influenzae in 88 % of all positive cultures, using only 1 ml or less of blood, is attributed to the fact that 68 % of the cultures had counts in excess of 100 colony-forming units per ml. The reproducibility of the QDP method was documented by the fact that <b>duplicate</b> blood <b>cultures</b> taken within a few hours of each other yielded comparable results on the number of bacteria at low (1 to 100 /ml), moderate (100 to 1, 000 /ml), and high (greater than 1, 000 /ml) levels of bacteremia. We concluded that the QDP method is a valuable, simple, and inexpensive supplementary technique to the semi-automated BACTEC procedure for the rapid diagnosis of H. influenzae bacteremia in children...|$|R
