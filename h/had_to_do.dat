25|$|I don't {{know what}} Color Field {{painting}} means. I {{think it was}} probably invented by some critic, which is okay, but I don't think the phrase means anything. Color Field painting? I mean, what is color? Painting <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{with a lot of}} things. Color is among the things it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with. It <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with surface. It <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with shape, It <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with feelings which are more difficult to get at.|$|R

5|$|Schweizer {{alleged that}} Moran {{made more than}} 90 trades that day.

5|$|After the {{initiation}} of U.S. naval interdiction efforts in coastal waters, known as Operation Market Time, the trail <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> double duty. Materiel sent from the north was stored in caches in the border regions that were soon retitled Base Areas, which, in turn, became sanctuaries for NLF and PAVN forces seeking respite and resupply after conducting operations within South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|By 1958, Lê Duẩn {{ranked second}} only to Hồ in the party hierarchy, {{although}} Trường Chinh remained powerful. Lê Duẩn was a party man and never held a post in the government. He made a brief, secret visit to South Vietnam in 1958, writing a report, The Path to Revolution in the South, in which he stated that the North Vietnamese <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more to assist the southern fighters. The Central Committee decided to initiate the revolution in January 1959.|$|E
5|$|Gair has now {{developed}} a style {{as a body}} painter. Her typical job takes her and her team eight hours, but some jobs take twice that. She does not charge by the hour. Gair is always well prepared for her jobs, but does not generally sketch her work on paper. In fact, she claims to have only <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so twice in over twenty years of body painting. When she needs to test something out she usually uses her opposite (left) arm or hand.|$|E

5|$|Hoover {{accompanied}} Harding on the Western {{trip and}} later wrote that Harding asked then what Hoover {{would do if}} he knew of some great scandal, whether to publicize it or bury it. Hoover replied that Harding should publish and get credit for integrity, and asked for details. Harding stated that it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Smith but, when Hoover enquired as to Daugherty's possible involvement, Harding refused to answer.|$|E

5|$|On January 21, 1813, eight city commissioners visited Redheffer {{to inspect}} the machine. They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so through a barred window, as Redheffer was {{concerned}} anyone going near the machine might damage it. One of the inspectors, Nathan Sellers, was accompanied by his son Coleman, who noticed something odd about the gears. The machine itself {{was said to be}} powering a separate device through a series of gears and weights. Coleman noticed that the cogs were worn on the wrong side and suggested that the device was in fact powering the machine.|$|E

5|$|TNA {{held the}} first-ever Barbed Wire Massacre at Turning Point between Abyss and Sabu. TNA advertised the Barbed Wire Massacre between Abyss and Sabu on the November19 episode of Impact!. The {{reasoning}} behind the match stipulation <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Abyss fearing barbed wire in the storyline. Abyss challenged this fear on the December3 episode of Impact!, by bashing Sabu {{over the head}} with a barbed wire wrapped steal chair. Sabu defeated Abyss at the event to end their rivalry.|$|E

5|$|The {{main problem}} the crew faced was the cold; in the morning, the {{temperatures}} peaked at around −22°F, while by mid-afternoon it often dropped to −50°. The stuntmen, dressed in woolen costumes, {{were in danger}} of catching pneumonia. Ice caverns producer Jaffe had scouted partially melted before filming; with only two-and-a-third days of time to film, the crew <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the best they could. Batteries drained after minutes of filming in the cold, and the lack of snow was compensated by dropping fake precipitation into the scene by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The ship's crew {{comprised}} 50 {{officers and}} 656 ratings in 1863.
