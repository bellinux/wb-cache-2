5|$|At the {{northern}} end of Goswell Road, the route northwards follows a one-way section to the Angel, turning right into Islington <b>High</b> <b>Street.</b> The southwards route from Islington <b>High</b> <b>Street</b> follows City Road for a short distance before joining Goswell Road via Wakley Street. The earliest reference to Islington <b>High</b> <b>Street</b> is its appearance on a 1590 map of the area. At this time, nine inns (including the Angel, which subsequently gave its name to the area), as well as housing and a public pond were shown lining the street. The Peacock Inn, one of the nine inns, and which operated on Islington <b>High</b> <b>Street</b> from 1564 to 1962, was where Tom of Tom Brown's Schooldays stayed prior to travelling to Rugby School. In 1716 Islington <b>High</b> <b>Street</b> came {{under the control of the}} newly formed Islington Turnpike Trust. The Trust grew rapidly and soon had control of most major roads in the area, building a number of major road arteries through the expanding residential areas, including Caledonian Road, Euston Road, City Road and New North Road.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} new town was planned, Crawley was a retail centre for the {{surrounding}} area: there were 177 shops in the town in 1948, 99 of which were on the <b>High</b> <b>Street.</b> Early new town residents relied on these shopping facilities until the Corporation implemented the master plan's designs for a new shopping area on the mostly undeveloped land east of the <b>High</b> <b>Street</b> and north of the railway line. The Broadwalk and its 23 shops were built in 1954, followed by the Queen's Square complex and surrounding streets in the mid-1950s. Queen's Square, a pedestrianised plaza surrounded by large shops and linked to the <b>High</b> <b>Street</b> by The Broadwalk, was officially opened in 1958 by Queen Elizabeth II. The town centre was completed by 1960, by which time Crawley was already recognised as an important regional, rather than merely local, shopping centre.|$|E

40|$|In one of {{the most}} {{exhaustive}} evidence reviews into <b>high</b> <b>streets,</b> town centres and consumer habits ever conducted in Britain, researchers at the University of Southampton have highlighted that seismic shifts in consumer behaviour, combined with significant technological innovations, are having a deep and profound impact on the evolution of UK <b>high</b> <b>streets.</b> Funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and commissioned by the Government’s advisory group The Future <b>High</b> <b>Streets</b> Forum, this report {{comes at a time when}} radical shifts in consumer culture and practices are becoming increasingly apparent and widely discussed in public debate on what is changing UK town centres and <b>high</b> <b>streets.</b> This review offers an important resource for many groups with stakes in British town centres and <b>high</b> <b>streets.</b> It reflects the fact that reversing the decline of Britain’s <b>high</b> <b>streets</b> can only be achieved through research and informed discussion and by harnessing the goodwill and common purpose which has recently been displayed by the many stakeholders in the retail, hospitality, property and leisure sectors in working together to understand and address those challenges...|$|R

5|$|Kirkcaldy's town centre, {{which serves}} a large {{catchment}} area of around 130,000 residents within a 20-minute drive, {{is the largest}} in Fife in terms of retail floor space.

The <b>High</b> <b>Street,</b> which runs parallel to the Esplanade, {{is home to the}} Mercat Shopping Centre and Postings Shopping Centre. A regeneration programme to upgrade the appearance of the <b>High</b> <b>Street</b> was completed in late 2011. A separate project has also created a 'green corridor' to link the main railway station and bus station with the <b>High</b> <b>Street.</b> The budget for the entire project was £4million, £2million of which was provided through the Scottish Government's Town Centre Regeneration Fund.|$|E
5|$|NY31F {{originally}} {{ran through}} the center of Fairport, turning north at NY250 and sharing Main Street with NY250 on a short concurrency between Church Street and <b>High</b> <b>Street.</b> NY31F turned east at <b>High</b> <b>Street</b> and followed it to Turk Hill Road, where NY31F continued east on its current alignment. The route was realigned onto its current alignment through Fairport on April1, 1984, {{as a result of a}} highway maintenance swap between the state of New York and the village of Fairport. In the swap, ownership and maintenance of <b>High</b> <b>Street</b> was transferred from the state to Fairport in exchange for control over the portion of East Church Street between NY250 and Turk Hill Road.|$|E
