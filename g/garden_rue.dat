50|$|The {{garden is}} bordered {{from the north}} by Rue Spears, from the south by Rue Alameddine, from the east by Rue Halawani and from the west by Rue Sanayeh. Facing the <b>garden</b> on <b>Rue</b> Spears is the complex of the National Library. Covering 22,000 square meters, the garden is a popular {{destination}} for walkers, joggers and children. The garden is also popular among the elderly who sit {{in the shade of}} the trees to play cards, backgammon or chess. The garden is also a place where artists exhibit their work.|$|R
25|$|Excavations in the {{old town}} have {{discovered}} well-preserved houses showing some luxury. Among them, the most monumental are those in the rectory <b>garden</b> of <b>rue</b> Clemenceau. These show a comparable level {{to that of the}} Gallo-Roman domus such as those of Saint-Romain-en-Gal. Large parts of the floor mosaic are organised around a courtyard with a marble fountain. The building dates from the late third century, although parts date {{from the end of the}} Hellenistic era or the end of the Roman Republic. Another house paved with porphyry and green stone was excavated between rue des Palmiers and the rue de la Blancherie. The finds at the Antibes Museum of Archaeology suggests the main occupation between the 2nd and 4th century. Finds from the end of the Hellenistic era and the end of the Roman Republic is present on both sites.|$|R
40|$|The {{roof garden}} concept {{is one of}} the great {{insights}} of Le Corbusier. From technical solution, the roof-garden became a key spatial theme within Le Corbusier’s work and creativity, evolving to become a fundamental component of his vision for the contemporary city. Visionary and forward-looking, the view of Le Corbusier on the city and its landscape, still appears rich in suggestions today. His ideas about nature in the untamed state that were introduced on his roof <b>garden</b> in <b>rue</b> Nungesser-et-Coli, intertwine strong relations with the studies of the landscape designer Gilles Clement regarding the third landscape and the garden in motion. Le Corbusier’s concept of the roof garden as an urban public space is now being adopted in many roof-top projects all over the world, transforming the urban landscape and the traditional concept of the city, and now days can be seen as developed within the Landscape Urbanism approach...|$|R

50|$|The square {{received}} {{different names}} over time: it was successively named Place des Rameaux (1745), then Place du Séminaire (1810), but also Croix du Griffon, then Place du Compère, then Place de la Croix des Rempeaux. In {{the early years}} of the eighteenth century, the penitents of Notre Dame de Lorette erected a chapel which was sold to the sculptor Chinard, then was replaced by a building. The Grand Séminaire was at the place now occupied by the <b>garden</b> along the <b>rue</b> d'Alsace-Lorraine. Part of the space was occupied by the facilities of the rack and the funicular with the time (which were revised in 1976), which leads to La Croix-Rousse. Among famous people who lived in the street are the designers Jaley (1788), Mathieu Durand (1810), and Lyon scholar Saint-Olive (1872-1879).|$|R
5000|$|The {{house was}} {{situated}} at 30 rue de Provence, in an English <b>garden</b> between the <b>rue</b> de Provence and the rue de la Victoire. It {{opened on the}} rue de Provence with a large gate {{in the shape of}} a triumphal arch, in the [...] "Medici style", at the end of the rue Laffitte, which at the time was called the rue d'Artois. The house was visible from the street at the end of a its drive. There was also a circular central courtyard, with a rock in the centre and a colonnade around the outside. After her death in 1781, Mme Thelusson's eldest son, John Isaac de Thellusson Sorcy (1764-1828) completed the house. As they were Swiss nationals, the Thellusson family kept ownership of the hotel during the Revolution, but they returned to it only in 1797.|$|R
50|$|Roquemaure is {{believed}} to be the site where phylloxera, an insect that attacks the roots of grapevines, was first introduced into France from North America. In 1862 a local wine merchant, Mr. Borty, received a case containing rooted American vines from a New York vine-grower, Mr. Carle. This case contained native grapevines, including 'Clinton', 'Post-Oak', and 'Emily'. Mr. Borty, planted these American vines in ten rows within his walled <b>garden</b> at 21 <b>rue</b> Longue (renamed rue Placide Cappeau). The following summer in a vineyard at the nearby village of Pujaut, a number of vines began to die. By 1864 Borty's own Grenache and Alicante vines were showing symptoms of phylloxera infection. All the vines in the neighbouring village of Pujaut were either dead or dying by 1865 and the initial infection had spread to the towns of Orange and St-Rémy. By the end of 1868 the whole of the lower Rhône Valley was infected and by 1890 phylloxera had spread across most of France.|$|R
5000|$|The Louvre, once Paris' second Royal Palace, {{is today}} a museum, garden (Tuileries), and, more recently, a {{shopping}} mall and Fashion show centre (Le Carrousel du Louvre). The Palais Royal just to its north, at its origin a residence of the Cardinal Richelieu, is a walled <b>garden</b> behind its <b>rue</b> de Rivoli facade, with covered and columned arcades that house boutiques forming what could {{be considered to be}} Paris' first [...] "shopping arcade". This quarter in general has many 17th- and 18th-century buildings of large standing, {{as well as some of}} Paris' more grandiose constructions, namely along the avenue de l'Opéra, from the Haussmann era. The long perspective of massive buildings that make the northern side of the rue de Rivoli, with their covered and columned arcades, are a result of Paris' first attempt at reconstruction in a larger scale in the early 1840s, and today house the quarter's most tourist-oriented shops, boutiques and night-clubs.|$|R
40|$|Jean-Pierre Bayala, in Burkina Faso, {{has found}} a simple, {{effective}} and beneficial way to clean waste water from local handicraft workshops using the water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes). Simple, because it only needs four tanks. Effective, because the cleansed water {{can be used for}} irrigation after three weeks. And beneficial, because the fast-growing water lettuce can be used for feeding domestic animals and for compost. First pour the waste water, from which fats and oils have been removed, into a tank. After three days, switch the water to a second tank and cover it with water lettuces. A week later, switch it to a third tank and cover with new water lettuces, and after a week, put it in the fourth tank. Then the water can be used in nurseries and for aquaculture. It is not clean enough for drinking, and it should not be used on kitchen <b>gardens.</b> Jean-Pierre Balaya <b>Rue</b> Langeveld, 113 A 1180 Brussels, BelgiumJean-Pierre Bayala, in Burkina Faso, {{has found a}} simple, effective and beneficial way to clean waste water from local handicraft workshops using the water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes).

6000|$|I {{want you}} to find this, as by ancient and inviolate custom, or at least intention, on your table on Christmas a.m.; but am {{convinced}} that, whenever I post it, it will reach you either before or after, and not with true dramatic effect. It will take you in any case, however, the assurance of my affectionate fidelity--little as anything else for the past year, or I fear a longer time, {{may have contributed to}} your perception of that remembrance. The years and the months go, and somehow make our meetings ingeniously rarer and our intervals and silences more monstrous. It is the effect, alas, of our being as it were antipodal Provincials--for even if one of us were a Capitalist the problem (of occasional common days in London) would be by so much simplified. I am in London less, on the whole (than during my first years in this place;) and as you appear now to be there never, I flap my wings and crane my neck in the void. Last spring, I confess, I committed an act of comprehensive disloyalty; I went abroad at the winter's end and remained till the first days of July (the first half of the time in Paris, roughly speaking--and on a long and very interesting, extraordinarily interesting, motor-tour in France; the second in Rome and Venice, as to take leave of them forever.) This took London almost utterly out of my year, and I think I heard from Gosse, who happily for him misses you so much less than I do, (I mean enjoys you so much more--but no, that isn't right either!) that you had in May or June shone in the eye of London. I am not this year, however, I thank my stars, to repeat the weird exploit of a [...] "long continental absence"--such things have quite ceased to be in my real moeurs--and I shall therefore plan a campaign in town (for May and June) that will have for its leading feature to encounter you somewhere and somehow. Till then--that is to a later date than usual--I expect to bide quietly here, where a continuity of occupation--strange to say--causes the days and the months to melt in my grasp, and where, in spite of rather an appalling invasion of outsiders and idlers (a spreading colony and a looming menace,) the conditions of life declare themselves as emphatically my rustic [...] "fit" [...] as I ten years ago made them out to be. I have lived into my little house and garden so thoroughly that they have become a kind of domiciliary skin, that can't be peeled off without pain--and in fact to go away at all is to have, rather, the sense of being flayed. Nevertheless I was glad, last spring, to have been tricked, rather, into a violent change of manners and practices--violent partly because my ten weeks in Paris were, for me, on a basis most unprecedented: I paid a visit of that monstrous length to friends (I had never done so in my life before,) and in a beautiful old house {{in the heart of the}} Rive Gauche, amid old private hotels and hidden <b>gardens</b> (<b>Rue</b> de Varenne), tasted socially and associatively, so to speak, of a new Paris altogether and got a bellyful of fresh and nutritive impressions. Yet I have just declined a repetition of it inexorably, and it's more and more vivid to me that I have as much as I can tackle to lead my own life--I can't ever again attempt, for more than the fleeting hour, to lead other people's. (I have indeed, I should add, suffered infiltration of the poison of the motor--contemplatively and touringly used: that, truly, is a huge extension of life, of experience and consciousness. But I thank my stars that I'm too poor to have one.) I'm afraid I've no other adventure to regale you with. I am engaged, none the less, in a perpetual adventure, the most thrilling and in every way the greatest of my life, and which consists of having more than four years entered into a state of health so altogether better than I had ever known that my whole consciousness is transformed by the intense alleviation of it, and I lose much time in pinching myself to see if this be not, really, [...] "none of I." [...] That fact, however, is much more interesting to myself than to other people--partly because no one but myself was ever aware of the unhappy nature of the physical consciousness from which I have been redeemed. It may give a glimmering sense of the degree of the redemption, however, that I should, in the first place, be willing to fly in the face of the jealous gods by so blatant a proclamation of it, and in the second, find the value of it still outweigh the formidable, the heaped-up and pressed together burden of my years.|$|R
