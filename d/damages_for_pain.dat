On September 19, after performing at a college event, he and Barker were aboard a Learjet 60 when it crashed upon takeoff in Columbia, South Carolina. The crash killed both crew members {{and the other two}} passengers, a security guard and Barker's assistant, critically injuring Goldstein and Barker. Goldstein suffered third-degree burns to his arm and parts of his head. Both he and Barker were transported to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, Georgia. Moore flew to be by Goldstein's side in hospital, and the media reported that they were dating again. He was released on September 26, 2008, and was expected to make a full recovery. In December 2008, Goldstein filed a civil lawsuit against the plane's charter company, Learjet and Goodyear tires; the suit claimed negligence {{on the part of the}} pilots, and a manufacturing defect on part of the plane. He asked for <b>damages</b> <b>for</b> <b>pain</b> and suffering, mental anguish, disfigurement and loss of earnings. The lawsuit was settled by his estate in 2010, a year after his death.|$|E

After Beckett is hospitalized, another partner, Bob Seidman, who noticed Beckett's lesions confesses that he suspected Beckett had AIDS but {{never told anyone}} and never gave {{him the opportunity to}} explain himself, which he regretted very much. During his hospitalization, the jury votes in Beckett's favor, awarding him back pay, <b>damages</b> <b>for</b> <b>pain</b> and suffering and punitive damages, totaling over $5 million. Miller visits the visibly failing Beckett in the hospital after the verdict and overcomes his fear enough to touch Beckett's face. After Beckett's family leaves the room, he tells his partner Miguel that he is ready to die. At the Miller home, Joe and his wife are awakened by a phone call from Miguel, who tells them that Beckett has died. A reception is held at Beckett's home following the funeral, where many mourners, including Miller, view home movies of Beckett as a happy child.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} widely held belief that <b>damages</b> <b>for</b> <b>pain</b> and {{suffering}} are random or arbitrary. We empirically analyze the differential {{impact of a}} plaintiff's personal characteristics, pain-specific circumstances and a lawsuit's procedural features on such payments. Relying on a dataset of about 2, 200 pain and suffering verdicts from Germany between 1980 and 2006, we observe that final awards are systematically in uenced by the injury's conditions (most importantly the intensity and severity of damage), while individual characteristics such as gender and age turn out insignificant. Regarding the lawsuit, {{it appears to be}} relevant at which court level the case is brought in and whether the plaintiff hires a lawyer or not. On balance, our findings suggest that compensations are consistent with the legal framework of the German tort law, letting us conclude that <b>damages</b> <b>for</b> <b>pain</b> and suffering are widely predictable rather than random.

This is known as expectation interest (or expectation damages), which attempts to put the plaintiff into a position where they would have been had the contract not been breached.

40|$|Since the 1980 s, tort <b>damages</b> <b>for</b> <b>pain</b> and {{suffering}} have excited hue and cry. Twenty-three states currently place statutory limitations on tort <b>damages</b> <b>for</b> <b>pain</b> {{and suffering}}: seven states cap damages in general tort cases; an additional sixteen states limit awards solely in medical malpractice cases. Several states also have provisions limiting damages in other, very {{specific types of}} tort cases. While some statutes have been invalidated on state constitutional grounds, others have survived judicial scrutiny. At the federal level, both the House of Representatives and the Senate have passed tort-reform bills. Although no compromise legislation has been enacted, {{this is the first}} time that both chambers of Congress have passed bills limiting recovery for pain and suffering. Against this political backdrop, a number of leading legal economists have advanced the 2 ̆ 2 insurance theory 2 ̆ 2 of tort compensation to justify the elimination of tort <b>damages</b> <b>for</b> <b>pain</b> and suffering. The insurance theory 2 ̆ 7 s roots lie in neoclassical economics, and it adopts the broader discipline 2 ̆ 7 s guiding normative principle of economic rationality to decide the sorts of injuries for which a victim ought to be able to recover damages in tort. The insurance theory 2 ̆ 7 s central premise is that accident victims should not recover damages for injuries against which it would not have been economically rational to insure. In other words, if an economically rational agent would not purchase first-party insurance for a certain type of injury, tortfeasors should not be required to pay damages for it. Insurance theorists conclude that rational actors would not insure against nonpecuniary losses, and therefore accident victims should not be able to recover tort damages for them...|$|E

40|$|On January 1, 1995, Saskatchewan {{adopted a}} radical, no-fault system for motor vehicle {{accident}} insurance. Virtually no room was left for injured victims to sue <b>for</b> <b>damages,</b> whether <b>for</b> <b>pain</b> and suffering or for economic compensation. In fact, the no-fault system removed benefits <b>for</b> <b>pain</b> and suffering altogether. Apart from the concern that arose at the denial of justice in relation to economic matters and the blanket denial of pain, there was concern over the arrangements for medical care. Under the new Automobile Accident Insurance Act, injured persons were entitled to compensation and payment for treatment, as managed by their own doctors, chiropractors or physiotherapists {{for the first six}} weeks subsequent to an injury. Thereafter, they were required to be seen by insurance company-appointed doctors, chiropractors or physiotherapists if they wished the income replacement benefits to continue, treatment to be provided or both. They also were obliged to accept the recommendations of the insurance company doctors for the next 12 weeks, under what was called 'secondary rehabilitation'. If they claimed not to be well {{at the end of that}} period, further rehabilitation, described as 'tertiary rehabilitation' would be ordered. Two specific 'in-patient' centres were established for tertiary rehabilitation in different parts of the province (Regina and Saskatoon), and victims thought to be in need of tertiary rehabilitation had to travel if they did not live in either Regina (the provincial capital) or Saskatoon. The administration and treatment of individuals under these systems were so unacceptable to many individuals that a widespread resistance movement was generated and was established as the Coalition Against No-Fault Insurance on August 28, 1998, opening with simultaneous protests in Regina, Saskatoon, Prince Albert North Battleford and Estevan, each one organized by a local victim of the no-fault insurance scheme...|$|R

He opposed tax increases and the allocation of federal earmarks. He called for massive spending cuts in the federal bureaucracy, specifically the Department of Education and the Veterans Administration, and for reforming eligibility requirements for entitlement programs, including raising age requirements, imposing means tests, and ending federal benefits to illegal immigrants.

40|$|The {{rationales}} {{behind and}} the effectiveness of the compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses in Hong Kong’s personal injury disputes will be examined in this project. Special consideration will be given to the assessment of <b>damages</b> <b>for</b> <b>pain,</b> suffering and loss of amenity (“PSLA”). On the other hand, the potential use of structured settlements or periodical payment orders (“PPO”) as a substitute for (or together with) lump-sum awards will also be examined. The primary sources of data comprise all judgments on personal injury issued by the Hong Kong Judiciary during 1976 - 2016. PSLA involves converting pain into dollars, which is not a process of mathematical measurement. It involves sound judgment and principled discretion guided by moral norms. For the purpose of constructing a coherent and logical framework, the statistical relationship between PSLA awards and other relevant factors, such as medical expenses, will be examined. In catastrophic personal injury cases, the lump-sum awards hinge on estimates of the claimants’ life expectancy and investment returns over inflation. However, claimants may exhaust their funds by surviving longer than their projected life expectancy, or due to lower-than-expected investment returns. PPO provide for regular payments over their lifetime, which are adjusted annually based on an inflation index. In this project, reforms focusing on PSLA and the use of PPO will be recommended...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been held that an award of <b>damages</b> <b>for</b> loss or {{impairment}} of future earning capacity should be reduced to its present value. There has, however, been a split of authority as to whether <b>damages</b> <b>for</b> future <b>pain</b> and suffering should also be discounted to present value. In Nebraska, it has been recognized that {{although there is no}} mathematical formula <b>for</b> translating <b>pain</b> and suffering into terms of dollars and cents, damages are nonetheless allowable. However, there has been considerable controversy in Nebraska as to whether these damages should be discounted to present value. Originally, cases dealing with the problem in Nebraska held {{that there should be no}} present value reduction <b>for</b> such <b>damages.</b> However, in Abbott v. Northwestem Bell Telephone Co. the Nebraska Supreme Court made it quite clear that future pain and suffering damages will now, like <b>damages</b> <b>for</b> loss or impairment of future earning capacity, be reduced to their present cash value. In so holding, Nebraska joins a small minority of states which require the present value reduction <b>for</b> future <b>pain</b> and suffering damages. The decision seems to indicate a fear on the court 2 ̆ 7 s part that unless the discount is made, the defendant is unduly and improperly penalized. This appears to be based on the belief that the defendant is being required to pay a sum worth more today than the amount computed by the jury as necessary to fully compensate the plaintiff as the loss occurs in the future. For this reason, it is thought that the plaintiff is being overcompensated. This reasoning raises an interesting question. If the court is concerned with awarding the most precise and accurate judgment possible <b>for</b> <b>pain</b> and suffering <b>damages,</b> should it not require the jury to consider future inflation and prejudgment interest along with the earning power of money? If the court 2 ̆ 7 s goal is to precisely and accurately award the plaintiff no more and certainly no less than that to which the plaintiff is rightfully entitled, it would seem only logical that the jury be so instructed. It would clearly be more equitable if the factors of inflation and prejudgment interest were given as much weight and consideration as the earning power of money when pain and suffering damages are awarded. The purpose of this Note is to examine the conflict as to whether future pain and suffering damages should be reduced to present cash value. Additionally, it explores the possibility of having Nebraska courts instruct their juries to give consideration not only to the earning power of money but also the equally important factors of future inflation and prejudgment interest when awarding pain and suffering damages...|$|R

5000|$|In Thake v Maurice 1984 2 All ER 513 {{a railway}} guard {{and his wife}} had five {{children}} living in a three-bedroomed council house and were unwilling to have further children. Thake consulted the surgeon who made it clear that a vasectomy was final and that Thake after the operation would become permanently sterile. Although the vasectomy was properly performed, the effect of this operation was naturally reversed and, not unexpectedly, Mrs. Thake conceived and a daughter was born. It was held that, applying the objective standard, the surgeon had contracted not merely to perform a vasectomy but had contracted to make Mr. Thake irreversibly sterile. The judge relied on the consent forms which stated that the vasectomy would be final. The claim was brought in contract and in tort. Peter Pain J. found that there was no reason why public policy prevented the recovery of expenses arising from the birth of a healthy child. He awarded damages in respect of the expenses of the birth and the mother's loss of wages but refused <b>damages</b> <b>for</b> the <b>pain</b> and distress of labour holding that these were off set by the joy occasioned by the birth. He did, however, award damages in an agreed sum for the child's upkeep to its seventeenth birthday. The Court of Appeal held that damages should be awarded <b>for</b> <b>pain</b> and suffering [...] "per the majority" [...] in tort rather than contract. The joy of having the child could be set off against the time, trouble and care in the upbringing of the child but not against prenatal <b>pain</b> and distress. <b>For</b> the latter, <b>damages</b> should be awarded. The case is also interesting because there was an alternative interpretation of the consent form. After sterilisation, some couples want to change their minds because their children have died or because they are seeing better days. Instead of the surgeon giving a guarantee of irreversible sterility which depended on the way in which human tissue healed, the warning of finality could be aimed at telling both husband and wife that they could not change their mind later and complain if the spouse had become permanently sterile.|$|R
