50|$|Another area {{in which}} {{bioactive}} glass has been investigated to use is enamel reconstruction, which {{has proven to be}} a difficult task in the field of dentistry. Enamel is made up of a very organized hierarchical microstructure of carbonated hydroxyapatite nanocrystals. It has been reported that Bioglass 45S5-phosphoric acid paste can be used to form an interaction layer that can obstruct dentinal tubule orifices and can therefore be useful in the treatment of dentin hypersensitivity lesions. This material in an aqueous environment could have an antibacterial property that is advantageous in periodontal surgical procedures. In a study done with 45S5 Bioglass, control biofilms of S. sanguis were grown on <b>inactive</b> <b>glass</b> particulates and the biofilm grown on the Bioglass was significantly lower than those that were on the <b>inactive</b> <b>glass.</b> It was concluded that Bioglass can reduce surface bacterial formation, which could benefit post-surgical periodontal wound healing. The most effective antibacterial bioactive glass is S53P4, which has exhibited a growth-inhibitory effect on the pathogens that was tested on it. Bioactive glasses that are sol-gel derived, such as CaPSiO and CaPSiO II, have also exhibited antibacterial property. Studies done with S. epidermidis and E. coli cultured with bioactive glass have shown that the 45S5 bioactive glass have a very high antibacterial resistance. It was also observed in the experiment that there were needle-like bioglass debris which could have ruptured the cell walls of the bacteria and rendered them inactive.|$|E
40|$|The East {{model has}} a {{dynamical}} phase transition between an active (fluid) and <b>inactive</b> (<b>glass)</b> state. We {{show that this}} phase transition generalizes to "softened" systems where constraint violations are allowed with small but finite probabilities. Moreover, we show that the first order coexistence line separating the active and inactive phases terminates in a finite-temperature space-time critical point. Implications of these results for equilibrium dynamics are discussed. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|We generalize the {{simplest}} kinetically constrained {{model of a}} glass-forming liquid by softening kinetic constraints, allowing them to be violated with a small rate. We demonstrate that this model supports a first-order dynamical (space-time) phase transition between active (fluid) and <b>inactive</b> (<b>glass)</b> phases. The first-order phase boundary in this softened model ends in a finite-temperature dynamical critical point, which may be present in natural systems. In this case, the glass phase has a very large but finite relaxation time. We discuss links between the dynamical critical point and quantum phase transitions, showing that dynamical phase transitions in d dimensions map to quantum transitions in the same dimension, and hence to classical thermodynamic phase transitions in d + 1 dimensions...|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} surrounding of Zn in <b>inactive</b> nuclear <b>glasses</b> {{was determined}} using extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. Zn {{was found in}} tetrahedral coordination ([4]Zn) with [4]Zn-O distances of 1. 95 Å. ZnO 4 tetrahedra shared corners with SiO 4 tetrahedra [d(Zn-Si) around 3. 20 Å]. The oxygens of the Zn-O-Si bonds were charge compensated by Na+ and, to a minor extent, by Cs+. The influence of [4]Zn on the formation of charge-compensating cations {{at the expense of}} network modifiers may explain the stabilizing effect of Zn in these glasses...|$|R
40|$|Multiferroism can {{originate}} from {{the breaking of}} inversion symmetry caused by magnetic-spiral order. The usual mechanism for stabilizing a magnetic spiral is competition between magnetic exchange interactions differing by their range and sign, such as nearest-neighbor and next-nearest- neighbor interactions. Since the latter are usually weak the onset temperatures for multiferroism via this mechanism are typically low. By considering a realistic model for YBaCuFeO$_ 5 $ we propose an alternative mechanism for magnetic-spiral order, and hence for multiferroism, that occurs at much higher temperatures. We show using Monte-Carlo simulations and electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory that the Heisenberg model on a geometrically non-frustrated lattice with only nearest-neighbor interactions can have a spiral phase up to high temperature when frustrating bonds are introduced randomly along a single crystallographic direction as caused, e. g., by {{a particular type of}} chemical disorder. This long-range correlated pattern of frustration avoids ferroelectrically <b>inactive</b> spin <b>glass</b> order. Finally, we provide an intuitive explanation for this mechanism and discuss its generalization to other materials. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures and supplemental material (8 pages and 6 figures...|$|R
40|$|The {{corrosion}} of the <b>inactive</b> multicomponent borosilicate <b>glass</b> R 7 T 7 was {{studied in}} a concentrated NaCl brine. Hydrothermal corrosion conditions were applied with fixed temperatures between 110 and 190 xC and a pressure of 130 bar. Long term corrosionconditions, i. e. silica saturation in the leachate, were established by corrosion of glass powders {{with a narrow}} particle size distribution. Glass chips were corroded together with glass powders {{in order to provide}} flat corroded glass samples for surface analysis with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results indicate deviations from a linear time law for long term, which might be due to an enrichment of Na at the surface of corroded glass...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the Hanford Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS), the DOE has chosen a multi-step privatization approach with a phase IA proof-of-principle effort prior to the design, construction and operation of an active vitrification plant for Low Active Waste (LAW) and possibly High Level Waste (HLW). In September 1996 the DOE selected a team led by Lockheed for the Phase IA proof-of-principle effort. Within this, team SGN was the technical leader for the High Level Waste process and proposed to implement the cold crucible technology, which offers significant advantages for processing the Hanford High Level Waste. SGN carried out an extensive testing program to establish the process feasibility and meet contractual requirements. These tests were performed successfully by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) in Marcoule. The test program included the following parts: • Preliminary glass formulation study for the HLW feed, based on theoretical analyses and confirmed by experimental laboratory work. • Variability study of the glass properties for major constituents and some minor constituents. • Vitrification and analysis of a radioactive sludge sample provided by the DOE (Hanford tank 241 -C- 106). • HLW process feasibility demonstration at laboratory scale for the HLW feed pretreatment steps and at pilot scale (40 % of industrial scale) for the calcination and vitrification steps. The work was completed in December 1997. The radioactive and <b>inactive</b> <b>glass</b> samples prepared at PNNL and in France not only met the requirements but clearly indicated that higher performance can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Zur Beurteilung des Langzeitverhaltens von hochradioaktivem Glas aus der Wiederaufarbeitung bei Kontakt mit Salzloesung wurden Korrosionsexperimente mit dem Glas R 7 T 7 (COGEMA-Glas), hergestellt bei CEA-Marcoule, durchgefuehrt. Ziel dieser Arbeiten ist die Untersuchung in welchem Ausmass Np, Pu, Am, und Tc bei der Korrosion von hochaktivem Glas in das Nahfeld mobilisiert werden, wenn endlagerrelevante (Gorleben) konzentrierte Salzloesungen in das Endlager eindringen sollten. Darueberhinaus soll ueberprueft werden, ob die umfangreiche Datenbasis zum Reaktionsverhalten von inaktivem R 7 T 7 -Glas mit Salzloesung auch zur Beschreibung des Verhaltens von hochaktiven Glasprodukten {{verwendet}} werden kann. Die Korrosionstests wurden durchgefuehrt mit Glaspulver (Korngroesse 86 #mu#m; S/V-Verhaeltnis= 9370 m"-" 1) und halitgesaettigter Mg(Ca) Cl_ 2 Salzloesung ueber Reaktionszeiten bis zu 720 Tagen bei 110, 150 und 190 C. Die Ergebnisse wurden verglichen mit denen, die mit dem entsprechenden inaktiven Glas unter den gleichen Versuchsbedingungen erzielt worden waren. Die Veraenderung des pH-Werts der Auslaugloesung in Abhaengigkeit von der Zeit ist bei den aktiven sowie bei den inaktiven Versuchen identisch. Die sich einstellenden niedrigen pH-Werte koennen mit der Bildung fester sekundaerer Phasen, insbesondere des Tonminerals Saponit erklaert werden. Die Zeit- und Temperaturabhaengigkeit der Reaktion des aktiven Glases stimmt mit derjenigen des inaktiven Glases sehr gut ueberein, was auf identische Korrosionsmechanismen schliessen laesst. Die Daten zur Mobilisierung von Pu und Am zeigen, dass Anteile dieser Glasbestandteile in unterschiedlichem Ausmass, jeweils in Abhaengigkeit von der Temperatur bei der Korrosion zurueckgehalten werden, dagegen werden Np und Tc kongruent mit den loeslichen Elementen des Glases mobilisiert. (orig. /DG) For performance {{assessment of}} {{high-level radioactive waste}} disposal in salt formations, corrosion tests were carried out, using high active R 7 T 7 -type glass containing reprocessing waste, produced by CEA Marcoule. The objective {{of this investigation was}} to describe the extent to which Np, Pu, Am and Tc are mobilized from vitrified high-level waste into the near field, when a repository-relevant (Gorleben) concentrated salt solution intrudes the emplacement locations. Furthermore, it should be assessed, if the large data base generated on the reaction behavior of inactive R 7 T 7 -type glass under saline conditions is applicable to the high active glass. Glass powder with an average grain size of 86 #mu#m (surface area to solution volume ratio S/V= 9370 m"-" 1) was corroded in a halite saturated concentrated Mg(Ca) Cl_ 2 - salt solution for periods of time up to 720 days at 110, 150 and 190 C. In order to assess, whether the results from previous inactive tests are applicable to those of the active experiments, the results of both type of experiments are compared. pH changes of the radioactive leachate are the same as in inactive leachates. Acidification of the leachate during glass dissolution results from the formation of solid alteration products, in particular of the clay mineral saponite. The time and temperature dependence of the reaction for the radioactive glass are in excellent agreement with that of the <b>inactive</b> <b>glass</b> suggesting that the corrosion mechanism remains the same. The data for Pu and Am release indicate that fractions of these glass constituents are retained to various degrees during glass corrosion, controlled by the temperature, whereas Np and Tc are released congruently with the soluble elements from the glass. In the presence of corroding container material concentrations of Np and Tc were found to be about 100 times lower whereas Pu concentrations were higher than in the parallel experiment without iron.

40|$|The Mo {{environment}} {{has been investigated}} in <b>inactive</b> nuclear <b>glasses</b> using extended X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Mo is present in a tetrahedron coordinated to oxygen {{in the form of}} molybdate groups [MoO 4] 2 − (d(Mo–O) = 1. 78 Å). This surrounding is not affected by the presence of noble metal phases in the nuclear glass. Relying on the XAS results, on the bond-valence model and on molecular dynamics simulations of a simplified borosilicate model glass, we show that these groups are not directly linked to the borosilicate network but rather located within alkali and alkaline-earth rich domains in the glass. This specific location in the glass network is a way to understand the low solubility of Mo in glasses melted under oxidizing conditions. It also explains the possible phase separation of a yellow phase enriched in alkali molybdates in molten nuclear glasses or the nucleation of calcium molybdates during thermal aging of these glasses. Boron coordination changes in the molten and the glassy states may explain the difference in the composition of the crystalline molybdates, as they exert a direct influence on the activity of alkalis in borosilicate glasses and melts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The local {{structure}} around Th, U, Ce and Nd in leached silicate glasses {{was examined}} using XAFS spectroscopy at their L 3 edges and {{also at the}} K edge of Fe, Co, Ni, Zr and Mo. Pellets of <b>inactive</b> borosilicate <b>glasses</b> with a simplified or a complex composition were leached statically at 90 °C, at pH buffered to 0 or 6 for 28 days (surface/volume, S/V, ratios of 0. 1 cm- 1). These glasses are compared to another SON 68 sample (denoted “SP 1 ” in this paper) that was statically leached for 12 years under similar conditions, except for a higher S/V of 12 cm- 1 and a higher unconstrained pH of 9. 6. The speciation of Fe, Co, Ni, Zr and Mo in the simple and the complex unleached are similar. In the statically leached glasses, the speciation of these transition metals is mostly identical to in the unleached glasses, except in the gels formed at {{the surface of the}} glasses leached at low pH, where large speciation differences are observed. Surface precipitates, especially for Fe (as ferrihydrite), Mo (possibly sidwillite) and Th (as ThO 2) were detected. Finally, the drying of the gels considerably affects the metal speciation by enhancing metal polymerization...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the scope}} of {{national}} and international radioactive waste disposal concepts, the intention is to dispose of radioactive waste in deep geological formations, in order to isolate them from the biosphere and avoid the release of radionuclides above an acceptable limit. Besides salt and granite, clay formations are investigated. For investigating the suitability of clay formations {{in terms of their}} physical and chemical behaviour, the Belgian research centre SCK-CEN is performing an in situ test called CORALUS (CORrosion of Active gLass in Underground Storage conditions) in the Boom clay of the Underground Research Facility HADES in Mol/VAL 97 /. The overall objective of the CORALUS project is to study the performance of both active and <b>inactive</b> HLW <b>glass</b> specimens in direct contact with different types of backfill materials under conditions as representative as possible for those expected to prevail in a disposal site in the Boom clay formation (#alpha#- and #gamma#-irradiation, temperature, pressure, backfill material, formation water, [...] .). The experimental set-up represents a scenario in which the vitrified waste comes into direct contact with the interacting backfill material and/or the Boom clay, because of the occurrence of fissures in the waste canisters and the metallic overpack.

40|$|International audiencea b s t r a c t An {{experimental}} study of thermally or water-induced crack healing in an <b>inactive</b> borosil-icate <b>glass,</b> chemically analogous to that used in France for the vitrification of nuclear waste was carried out. Partial welding of glass plates was observed after annealing in air at 425 °C (77 °C below T g) when at least 20 MPa compressive stress was applied, while annealing at 450 °C under 20 MPa led to a complete disappearance of the interface. Closure of indenta-tion-induced cracks was observed during annealing at 400 °C in an ESEM {{as a result of}} viscous relaxation of residual stresses but it did not constitute a sufficient proof of crack healing. DCDC specimens were thus pre-cracked in an ESEM and then either annealed at various temperatures (350 – 490 °C) in secondary vacuum or in air, or left in water at 70 – 90 °C, sometimes under a compressive stress normal to the crack face. The specimens were then reloaded in the ESEM and the crack opening displacements under a given load were compared to those measured during pre-cracking. The cracks were bridged by an alteration layer over a distance from the crack tip which decreased as loading increased. The restraining effect of these bridges on crack opening was assessed via finite element simulations, using interface elements. The tensile strength of the bridging layer was estimated as 27 – 39 MPa after vacuum annealing at 400 °C, 11 – 20 MPa after 15 days in water at 90 °C and 44 – 78 MPa after 11 days in water at 70 °C under 5 MPa normal compression. Partially healed cracks did not resume propagation from their former crack tip, but due to branch cracks re-initiated a few hundred microns behind it which grow avoiding the healed area. This behaviour was explained using finite element simulations...|$|R
