Of these, six amphibian, four reptile, and five mammal species are exclusively representatives of the Gran Chaco region. In total, 24 taxa of the recorded species are listed in current CITES Appendices I and II. Beside the distributional records given for each species, the microteiid lizard Gymnophthalmus rubricauda could be recorded for Paraguay {{for the first time}} (ZIEGLER et al. 2002 a).

40|$|This paper {{examined}} the relationship between corporate social investment and revenue in Woolworths Holdings Limited South Africa. The approach is thus a single case study, and financial data on social investment and revenue was retrieved from the Woolworths Holdings’ Good Business <b>Journey</b> <b>report</b> 2008 - 2013 and from its annual report of 2002 - 2007. Using the SPSS statistics software, a correlation was sought between the Woolworths Holdings’ social investment expenditure and revenue, earnings per share and return on equity. Findings from the analysis revealed that, within the six years of Woolworths Holdings’ Good Business Journey, a significant positive relationship exists between Woolworths Holdings’ social investment and its revenue, earnings per share (EPS) and return on equity (ROE). A further analysis of difference in means using the t-test statistics indicates that the revenue streams to Woolworths Holdings’ between 2008 – 2013 is significantly greater than the revenue streams in the six years before the Good Business Journey. In conclusion, the paper suggests a new research model, referred to in this research as the share holders’ support for corporate social investment model, and it is represented as: SHSSI = f (Rv+Es+Re+Of). The paper thus offers an agenda for further research to apply the above model to evaluate the degree of shareholders’ interest and support for corporate social investment in retailing and other companie...|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{opportunities}} available beyond the classroom for undergraduate students {{to engage in}} cutting-edge scholarship. Some of the opportunities include study abroad, internships, and independent study. We strongly suggest that students experience such programs. Independent study courses can serve not only to sharpen the student’s engagement skills with the open-ended questions of current research, but also to enhance {{his or her own}} relationship with faculty. In this article we share the experiences of a biology student and a mathematics faculty member coming together as co-adventurers learning from each other about the mechanisms and mathematics involved in cardiac arrhythmia through collaborative mathematical modeling research. Biology and mathematics {{have a long history of}} an explosive synergy that enriches and extends both fields (Cohen, 2004) (Reed, 2004), and this synergy led us to the fruitful <b>journey</b> <b>reported</b> here. As there is no end in sight for opportunities to engage in such multi-disciplinary student-faculty collaborative research, we encourage everyone to take advantage of such opportunities...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} experimentally the antecedents of ostensibly shamanic journeying imagery associated with the Lower World in naïve participants. Forty six participants completed a composite questionnaire consisting of demographic items and the Tellegen Absorption Scale (Tellegen and Atkinson 1974). Participants were randomly assigned to one of five conditions: Harner 2 ̆ 7 s (1990) shamanic journeying to the Lower World instructions coupled with monotonous percussion drumming at either 4 or 8 beats-per-second for either 10 or 15 minutes; and sitting quietly with eyes closed for 15 minutes. Participants 2 ̆ 7 phenomenology was retrospectively assessed using the Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory (Pekala 1991) and a mental imagery checklist. The results indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between conditions with regards to the number of ostensibly shamanic journeying images. After adjusting for Harner 2 ̆ 7 s (1990) instructions, a significant main effect was found for both beats-per-second and time with regards to the number of ostensibly shamanic <b>journeying</b> images <b>reported.</b> There was a statistically significant relationship between condition and the tendency to report mental imagery associated with rocky ravines, predatory creatures, and rivers. Religious devotion was found to be a significant predictor of the number of ostensibly shamanic <b>journeying</b> images <b>reported.</b> Religious exposure and trait absorption were significant predictors of altered experience.
