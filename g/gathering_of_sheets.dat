25|$|All of the manuscripts are codices, {{which was}} {{surprising}} {{to the first}} scholars who examined the texts because {{it was believed that}} the papyrus codex was not extensively used by Christians until the 4th century. Most of the manuscripts dated to the 3rd century, with some as early as the 2nd. The manuscripts also helped scholars understand the construction of papyrus codices. There is significant variation between the construction of each manuscript. Page size ranges from about 14 by 24.2cm (P. III) to 18 by 33cm (P. VI). Some of the manuscripts were constructed <b>of</b> a single <b>gathering</b> (quire) <b>of</b> papyrus <b>sheets</b> (Pap. II, VII, IX + X), while in others the gathering varies from a single sheet (I) to five (V) or seven (VII). The largest codex (P. IX/X) is believed to have contained roughly 236 pages.|$|R
25|$|In Venice, the Ljubavić {{brothers}} procured a {{press and}} began printing a hieratikon (priest's service book), copies {{of which were}} finished on 1July 1519 either in Venice or at the Church of Saint George {{in the village of}} Sopotnica near Goražde. After Đurađ Ljubavić died in Venice on 2March 1519, it is unclear whether his brother transported the press to Goražde before or after finishing the work on the hieratikon. At the Church of Saint George, Teodor organised the Goražde printing house, one of the earliest printing houses among the Serbs, and the first such facility in the territory of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. The printing house was run by Božidar Goraždanin, who, in 1521, instructed Teodor (Ljubavić) to print a psalter. Teodor managed the work, which included the redaction of the psalter's text, the design and carving of the decorative woodcuts, typesetting, preparation of ink and paper, printing, drying and <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> the printed <b>sheets,</b> and other tasks; the books were not bound at the printing house. The copies of the Goražde Psalter were finished on 25October 1521.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{book has}} 211 leaves and has pages made of parchment. It has nineteen <b>gatherings</b> <b>of</b> pages. Before {{the text of}} Regimen Animarum begins, there are four leaves which contain the New Office of the Corpus Christi. Each page is written with two columns and between 48 and 50 lines each. It also contains various pages <b>of</b> <b>sheet</b> music. All headings in the book are red, and initials are in blue. The codex binding is made of goatskin.|$|R
25|$|Block {{books were}} {{typically}} printed as folios, with two pages printed on one full <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> paper {{which was then}} folded once for binding. Several such leaves would be inserted inside another to form a <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> leaves, {{one or more of}} which would be sewn together to form the complete book.|$|R
5000|$|In medieval manuscripts a gathering, or quire, {{was most}} often formed <b>of</b> 4 folded <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> vellum or parchment, i.e. 8 leaves, 16 sides. The term [...] "quaternion" [...] (or {{sometimes}} quaternum) designates such a unit. A <b>gathering</b> made <b>of</b> a single folded sheet (i.e. 2 leaves, 4 sides) is a [...] "bifolium" [...] (plural [...] "bifolia"); a [...] "binion" [...] is a quire <b>of</b> two <b>sheets</b> (i.e. 4 leaves, 8 sides); and a [...] "quinion" [...] is five sheets (10 leaves, 20 sides). This last meaning is {{preserved in the}} modern Italian meaning of quire, quinterno di carta. Later, when bookmaking switched to using paper and it became possible to easily stitch 5 to 7 sheets at a time, the number <b>of</b> <b>sheets</b> and pages in a gathering became more variable.|$|R

50|$|In {{the hand}} press period (up to about 1820) books were {{manufactured}} by printing text {{on both sides}} <b>of</b> a full <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> paper and then folding the paper one or more times into a group <b>of</b> leaves or <b>gathering.</b> The binder would sew the gatherings (sometimes also called signatures) through their inner hinges and attached to cords in the spine to form the book block. Before the covers were bound to the book, the block of text pages was sometimes trimmed along the three unbound edges to open {{the folds of the}} paper and to produce smooth edges for the book. When the leaves were not trimmed, the reader would have to cut open the leaf edges using a knife.Books made by printing two pages of text on each side <b>of</b> a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> paper, which is then folded once to form two leaves or four pages, are referred to as folios (from Latin, foliō, ablative of folium, leaf). Those made by printing four text pages on each side <b>of</b> a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> paper and folding the paper twice to form a gathering containing four leaves or eight pages are called quartos (fourths). Similarly, books made by printing eight pages of text on each side <b>of</b> a <b>sheet,</b> which was then folded three times to form <b>gatherings</b> <b>of</b> eight leaves or sixteen pages each, are called octavos. The size of the resulting pages in these cases depends, of course, on the size <b>of</b> the full <b>sheet</b> used to print them and how much the leaves were trimmed before binding, but where the same size paper is used, folios are the largest, followed by quartos and then octavos. The proportion of leaves of quartos tends to be squarer than folios or octavos.|$|R
