25|$|The {{deck and}} command crew (hypēresia) was {{headed by the}} helmsman, the kybernētēs, who was always an {{experienced}} seaman and was often the actual commander of the vessel. These experienced sailors were to {{be found on the}} upper levels of the triremes. Other officers were the bow lookout (prōreus or prōratēs), the boatswain (keleustēs), the quartermaster (pentēkontarchos), the shipwright (naupēgos), the piper (aulētēs) who gave the rowers' rhythm and two superintendents (toicharchoi), in charge of the rowers {{on each side of the}} ship. What constituted these sailors' experience was a combination of superior rowing skill (physical stamina and/or consistency in hitting with a <b>full</b> <b>stroke)</b> and previous battle experience. The sailors were likely in their thirties and forties. In addition, there were ten sailors handling the masts and the sails.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two forms}} to the combat side stroke: the <b>full</b> combat side <b>stroke</b> and the combat {{sprinter}} side stroke. The sprinter side stroke allows the swimmer to move faster {{in the water}} compared to the <b>full</b> side <b>stroke.</b>|$|R

50|$|The only {{difference}} between the <b>full</b> side <b>stroke</b> and sprinter side stroke is instead of bringing the second lead arm fully down {{to the side of}} the body the arm will only half stroke; the arm moves halfway towards the body and is then brought back to the fully extended position.|$|R

6000|$|It {{happened}} to be market-day, and Nicholas, having postponed the engagements which called him thither to keep the appointment {{with her in the}} Sallows, rushed off {{at the end of the}} afternoon to attend to them as well as he could. Arriving thus in a great hurry on account of the lateness of the hour, he still retained the wild, amphibious appearance which had marked him when he came up from the meadows to her side--an exceptional condition of things which had scarcely ever before occurred. When she crossed the pavement from the shop door, the shopman bowing and escorting her to the carriage, Nicholas chanced to be standing at the road-waggon office, talking to the master of the waggons. There were a good many people about, and those near paused and looked at her transit, in the <b>full</b> <b>stroke</b> of the level October sun, which went under the brims of their hats, and pierced through their button-holes. From the group she heard murmured the words: 'Mrs. Nicholas Long.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 4. This {{grace of}} fear is the softest and most tender of God's honour {{of any other}} grace. It is that tender, sensible, and {{trembling}} grace, that keepeth the soul upon its continual watch. To keep a good watch is, you know, a wonderful safety {{to a place that}} is in continual danger because of the enemy. Why, this is the grace that setteth the watch, and that keepeth the watchmen awake (Can 3:7,8). A man cannot watch as he should, if he be destitute of fear: let him be confident, and he sleeps; he unadvisedly lets into the garrison those that should not come there. Israel's fault when they came to Canaan was, that they made a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, to wit, the Gibeonites, without asking counsel of God. But would they have done so, think you, if {{at the same time the}} fear of God had had its full play in the soul, in the army? no, they at that time forgot to fear. The grace of fear had not at that time its <b>full</b> <b>stroke</b> and sway among them.|$|E

25|$|By the 5th century BC, {{the first}} triremes were in use by various {{powers in the}} eastern Mediterranean. It had now become a fully developed, highly {{specialized}} vessel of war that was capable of high speeds and complex maneuvers. At nearly 40m in length, displacing almost 50 tonnes, {{it was more than}} three times as expensive as a two-level penteconter. A trireme also had an additional mast with a smaller square sail placed near the bow. Up to 170 oarsmen sat on three levels with one oar each that varied slightly in length. To accommodate three levels of oars, rowers sat staggered on three levels. Arrangements of the three levels are believed to have varied, but the most well-documented design made use of a projecting structure, or outrigger, where the oarlock {{in the form of a}} thole pin was placed. This allowed the outermost row of oarsmen enough leverage for <b>full</b> <b>strokes</b> that made efficient use of their oars.|$|R

5000|$|From the start, Sunningdale {{was well}} regarded, and has hosted many {{important}} events. Examples include News of the World Match Play in 1903, 1907, 1912, and 1922; several stagings of the British Masters in the 1940s and 1950s; the 1974-79 Colgate European Open; the 1987 Walker Cup; the 1985, 1986, 1988 and 1992 European Open and the 1997, 2001, 2004 and 2008 Women's British Open. The Open Championship, International Final Qualifying {{has been held}} annually over the Old and New Courses since 2004. It was also the venue of the 2009 Senior British Open Championship, which was won by Loren Roberts. It hosted the Senior Open Championship again in July 2015, the winner being Marco Dawson. Bobby Jones had great fondness for Sunningdale. He scored 66-68 over it during qualifying for the 1926 British Open, with the 66 consisting of 33 <b>full</b> <b>strokes</b> and 33 putts, with every hole played in either 3 or 4; this has sometimes {{been described as the}} perfect round of golf. Jones said afterwards: [...] "I wish I could take this course home with me." [...] The original course is now called the Old Course, with the club having opened the New Course in 1923; it is also excellent and was designed by Harry Colt.|$|R

25|$|Wankel {{rotary engine}} and piston engine displacement, and {{corresponding}} power, output can more accurately be compared by displacement per {{revolution of the}} eccentric shaft. A calculation of this form dictates that a two-rotor Wankel displacing 654cc per face will have a displacement of 1.3 liters per every rotation of the eccentric shaft (only two total faces, one face per rotor going through a <b>full</b> power <b>stroke)</b> and 2.6 liters after two revolutions (four total faces, two faces per rotor going through a <b>full</b> power <b>stroke).</b> The results are directly comparable to a 2.6-liter piston engine with an even number of cylinders in a conventional firing order, which will likewise displace 1.3 liters through its power stroke after one revolution of the crankshaft, and 2.6 liters through its power strokes after two revolutions of the crankshaft. A Wankel rotary engine is still a four-stroke engine, and pumping losses from non-power strokes still apply, but the absence of throttling valves and a 50% longer stroke duration result in a significantly lower pumping loss compared to a four-stroke reciprocating piston engine. Measuring a Wankel rotary engine in this way more accurately explains its specific output, because the volume of its air fuel mixture put through a complete power stroke per revolution is directly responsible for torque, and thus the power produced.|$|R
