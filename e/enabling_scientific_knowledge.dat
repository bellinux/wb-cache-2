40|$|Supercomputing Centers (SC's) {{are unique}} {{resources}} that aim to <b>enable</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> discovery {{through the use}} of large computational resources, the Big Iron. Design, acquisition, installation, and management of the Big Iron are activities that are carefully planned and monitored. Since these Big Iron systems produce a tsunami of data, it is natural to co-locate visualization and analysis infrastructure as part of the same facility. This infrastructure consists of hardware (Little Iron) and staff (Skinny Guys). Our collective experience suggests that design, acquisition, installation, and management of the Little Iron and Skinny Guys does not receive the same level of treatment as that of the Big Iron. The main focus {{of this article is to}} explore different aspects of planning, designing, fielding, and maintaining the visualization and analysis infrastructure at supercomputing centers. Some of the questions we explore in this article include: "How should the Little Iron be sized to adequately support visualization and analysis of data coming off the Big Iron?" What sort of capabilities does it need to have?" Related questions concern the size of visualization support staff: "How big should a visualization program be (number of persons) and what should the staff do?" and "How much of the visualization should be provided as a support service, and how much should applications scientists be expected to do on their own?...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this work}} is to analyse the {{technical}} development performed in SCIENTIA, digital repository of the Ministry of Health. SCIENTIA project arises from {{the will of the}} Ministry of Health to provide open, free and permanent access to <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> generated by the different entities of the Catalan Public Health Administration, with the aim of increasing the visibility, impact and recognition of the research that is being conducted. Material and methods The operating characteristics of SCIENTIA have been defined: a) Context: community and audience, content typology, general conditions for the acceptance of documents and intellectual property; b) User policy: roles and access levels; c) Flows and processes: documental channel and preservation policies; d) Software technical characteristics and requirements, functionalities of content and collection management system, technical administration and services for users. To make the repository interoperable and to exchange data with other data collection and exploitation system of scientific output, metadata schemes based on the reference Open Archival Information System (OAIS), Dublin Core’s metadata standards, DRIVER guidelines, Creative Common licenses and a permanent URL were applied. Results With {{the development and implementation of}} SCIENTIA, we have obtained a tool that allows: to create and share knowledge, collect and preserve scientific output, increase the public value of participating institutions, and to maximize the visibility and the impact of scientific output. Conclusions The digital revolution has changed the way of disseminating scientific information. Access to scientific output is basic for research, innovation and scientific heritage preservation. To have a tool that promotes an open, free and permanent access and <b>enables</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> to be disseminated, shared and preserved over time is basic. ...|$|R

The question that motivated the research was: What kind of intervention articulates the scientific literacy and the reality? The perspective of this work was based in Latour's concept of inscription and a non-modern ethnographic perspective. The analysis happened in two stages: A) a description considering {{that the effect of}} a visual exhibition as direct inscription, keeps the nature and knowledge conceptions separate; B) by considering the interventions that are articulated as inscriptions to <b>enable</b> a specific <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge.</b> We finalize the article proposing that the reality exists when the inscription makes inseparable the means that produce from what is produced, according to a particular way...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the use of <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> by managing real estate in the municipal sector in the Netherlands in the present day. Design/methodology/approach - This research sets out the use of <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> in municipal organisations by analysing real estate strategies. The aspects, barriers and reasons that influence the use of <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> are researched. The empirical study is wrapped up with solutions which aim to stimulate the use of <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> to smaller the difficulty of real estate management for municipalities in practice. Findings - The analysis of the real estate strategies shows that only 15 % of the municipalities in the research sample uses <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge.</b> 93 % steers on one or more added values of real estate. Most of the municipalities, 68 %, steer on cost reduction with regard to real estate. Only 8 % of the municipalities steer on promotion of the city using real estate. Municipalities use <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> to support and clarify real estate management within the municipality. A lot of barriers are identified which refrain the municipalities from using the <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Research limitations/ implications – The results presented in the current study are semi-transparent due to 40 document analysis and the number of 5 interviews. Valuable insights can be produced by executing more interviews with the municipalities of the research sample. Originality/value – The use of <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> would smaller the difficulty of real estate management for municipalities.

50|$|W. V. O. Quine's {{version of}} {{formative}} epistemology considers reasons for serious {{doubt about the}} fruitfulness of traditional philosophic study of <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge.</b> These concerns are raised {{in light of the}} long attested incapacity of philosophers to find a satisfactory answer to the problems of radical scepticism, more particularly, to David Hume's criticism of induction. But also, because of the contemporaneous attempts and failures to reduce mathematics to pure logic by those in or philosophically sympathetic to The Vienna Circle. He concludes that studies of <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> concerned with meaning or truth fail to achieve the Cartesian goal of certainty. The failures in the reduction of mathematics to pure logic imply that <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> can at best be defined with the aid of less certain set-theoretic notions. Even if set theory's lacking the certainty of pure logic is deemed acceptable, the usefulness of constructing an encoding of <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> as logic and set theory is undermined by the inability to construct a useful translation from logic and set-theory back to <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge.</b> If no translation between <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> and the logical structures can be constructed that works both ways, then the properties of the purely logical and set-theoretic constructions do not usefully inform understanding of <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge.</b>|$|R
