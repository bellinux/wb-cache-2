5000|$|In 1926 the United States Government sold Fort Montgomery {{along with}} its {{adjacent}} Military Reservation at public auction. During the period of disuse which followed, as had also happened with the abandoned 1816 fortification, many locals visited the fort, carting off untold amounts of lumber, bricks, windows, and doors for use {{in their homes and}} other buildings. Ultimately most of the fort, aside from the gutted westward facing officer's quarters, {{a small portion of the}} southern wall and three bastions (two of which remain today), was demolished in 1936-1937. Its massive stones were crushed and dumped into the lake for fill to construct a nearby bridge between Rouses Point, New York and Alburg, Vermont. The property had a number of private owners before it was sold in 1983 to Victor Podd, Sr. who constructed the headquarters of the Powertex Corporation on the adjacent [...] "Commons" [...] to the west of the fort. Island Point, the actual fort site, was left untouched. During the mid-1980s Podd worked with local historical societies to have the State of New York purchase the property with a view toward possible restoration of the site. Despite being offered the fort at no cost, negotiations were unsuccessful and the State declined to accept the property. Since May 2006, Podds' heirs have attempted to sell the fort on eBay. The <b>first</b> <b>auction</b> ended on <b>June</b> 5, 2006, with a winning bid of $5,000,310. However, the sale was not completed, and the fort and lands surrounding it remain for sale. http://www.privateislandsonline.com/fort-montgomery-newyork.htm ...|$|R

40|$|A {{sequential}} weakly efficient two-auction {{game with}} entry costs, interdependence between objects, two potential bidders and IPV assumption is presented here {{in order to}} give some theoretical predictions on the effects of geographical scale economies on local service privatization performance. It is shown that the first object seller takes profit of this interdependence. The interdependence externality rises effective competition for the first object, expressed as the probability of having more than one final bidder. Besides, if {{there is more than one}} final bidder in the <b>first</b> <b>auction,</b> seller extracts the entire bidders expected future surplus differential between having won the <b>first</b> <b>auction</b> and having lost. Consequences for second object seller are less clear, reflecting the contradictory nature of the two main effects of object interdependence. On the one hand, <b>first</b> <b>auction</b> winner becomes stronger, so that expected payments rise in a competitive environment. On the other hand, <b>first</b> <b>auction</b> loser becomes relatively weaker, hence (probably) reducing effective competition for the second object. Additionally, some contributions to static auction theory with entry cost and asymmetric bidders are presented in the appendix. local service, privatization...|$|R
