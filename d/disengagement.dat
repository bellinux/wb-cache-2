30|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} everyday attentional <b>disengagements</b> in educational contexts. Undergraduate students completed various cognitive ability {{measures in the}} laboratory and recorded everyday mind-wandering and distraction in a diary {{over the course of}} a week. Participants reported mind-wandering and being distracted both in class and while studying and there were a number of different subtypes of attentional <b>disengagements.</b> Individual differences in cognitive abilities were related to some, but not all, everyday attentional <b>disengagements</b> and motivation and interest in classes were related to specific subtypes of <b>disengagements.</b> Finally, academic performance was related to fluid intelligence and motivation, but not to everyday <b>disengagements.</b> These results provide importance evidence on the different types of attentional <b>disengagements</b> that are prevalent in undergraduate students and for whom <b>disengagements</b> are most likely.|$|R
30|$|The {{current study}} {{demonstrated}} that undergraduate students {{are susceptible to}} a number of different types of attentional <b>disengagements</b> that occur both in class and while studying. These <b>disengagements</b> range from being distracted by surrounding conversations, to mind-wandering because the current lecture is boring, to worrying about future exam performance. These everyday attentional <b>disengagements</b> were shown to be related to important cognitive abilities such as working memory capacity, attention control, and fluid intelligence. Furthermore, mind-wandering and external distraction assessed during demanding laboratory tasks were related to everyday attention <b>disengagements</b> in some situations. Motivation to do well and overall interest in class similarly predicted some types of attentional <b>disengagements.</b> Finally, academic performance (end of the term GPA) was related to motivation and fluid intelligence, but not to everyday attentional <b>disengagements.</b> The current results provide important evidence suggesting that undergraduate students are prone to mind-wandering and distraction in educational contexts with some students being more susceptible to certain types of attentional <b>disengagements</b> than others.|$|R
30|$|Second, as {{mentioned}} previously {{we did not}} specifically ask participants to note whether a particular <b>disengagements</b> was intentional or unintentional. Given the importance of examining potential differences between intentional versus unintentional <b>disengagements</b> (in particular, mind-wandering; Giambra, 1995; Seli, Risko, et al., 2016; Seli, Wammes, et al., 2016; Wammes, Seli, et al., 2016) {{it would have been}} beneficial to examine deliberate <b>disengagements</b> of attention versus more spontaneous and unintentional <b>disengagements</b> and how these are related to individual differences in cognitive abilities, motivation, interest, and academic performance. Future research should more finely measure and examine potential similarities and differences between intentional and unintentional <b>disengagements</b> not only for mind-wandering (e.g., Wammes, Seli, et al., 2016), but also for various distractions (especially self-distractions).|$|R

5|$|In 2000, the Second Intifada (also called al-Aqsa Intifada) began, and Israel built a {{separation}} barrier.

30|$|Mind-wandering and {{distraction}} are two potent {{forms of}} attentional <b>disengagements</b> that plague students both {{in class and}} while studying. In the current study undergraduate students performed a number of cognitive ability measures in the laboratory and logged their attentional <b>disengagements</b> in a diary {{over the course of}} a week. The results suggested that both mind-wandering and distraction occur in class and while studying. Furthermore, various subtypes of attentional <b>disengagements</b> were identified suggesting that some of the most frequent <b>disengagements</b> were being distracted by surrounding conversations and other information, self-distraction with technology, and mind-wandering because of boredom and disinterest in the course material. Individual differences in cognitive abilities, motivation, and interest predicted various <b>disengagements.</b> The current study provides key evidence that attentional <b>disengagements</b> are a common hindrance to undergraduate students and there are important individual differences in the susceptibility to everyday mind-wandering and external distraction.|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{as noted}} above, our only measure of {{academic}} performance was {{end of the}} term grades. Given that participants participated for 1 week throughout the term {{it was not possible}} to tie attentional <b>disengagements</b> to quiz or exam scores. Future research should more thoroughly examine the relation between various attentional <b>disengagements</b> (both in class and while studying) and academic performance (quizzes, exams, final grades) by tracking participants throughout an entire term rather than at random points throughout the term. This would allow for a better assessment of attentional <b>disengagements</b> at important points during the term (before or after exams) and better examine whether the type and frequency of attentional <b>disengagements</b> are salient predictors of performance.|$|R
30|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that attentional <b>disengagements</b> in educational contexts (i.e., while studying or in class) are a major hindrance to students’ ability to learn and retain information. For example, early reports suggested that students spend 10 – 40 % of class time thinking about topics unrelated to the class (Schoen, 1970). Furthermore, recent {{research has suggested that}} students begin to experience <b>disengagements</b> (mind-wandering or external distraction) within the first 5 min of class with increasing frequency of <b>disengagements</b> as the lecture progresses (Bunce, Flens, & Neiles, 2010). Additionally, recent research suggests that roughly 76 % of college students’ <b>disengagements</b> occur either in class or while studying (Unsworth, McMillan, et al., 2012). Clearly, understanding the nature of the these attentional <b>disengagements</b> and for whom, and under what circumstances, they are most frequent is important in order to not only understand how the attentional system operates in the real world but to also devise better interventions to keep students focused in class and while studying to ensure better learning and retention of material.|$|R
5|$|Israel {{continued}} {{to control the}} city until early June 1974, when it was returned to Syrian civilian control following the signature of a United States-brokered <b>disengagement</b> agreement signed on 31 May 1974. The surrender of Quneitra was controversial, with Israeli settlers and the Likud and National Religious Party opposing it. According to Michael Mandelbaum, the agreement provided {{that the city was}} to be repopulated to serve as evidence of peaceful Syrian intentions, by doing so it would encourage the Israelis to pull back further.|$|E
5|$|After Vietnam, the Army {{retained}} the 173rd Airborne Brigade {{as a quick}} deploying contingency brigade. However, with the ending of conscription following America's <b>disengagement</b> from Vietnam, many of the Army's formations had to be rebuilt for the volunteer force. One of these was the 101st Airborne Division, which had also been redeployed to Fort Campbell. It was decided that the 173rd {{would be used to}} help rebuild the division, which had been converted into an airmobile formation during the Vietnam War. The brigade was inactivated on 14 January 1972 at the fort, and its assets were used to form the 3rd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, a parachute component within the airmobile 101st. The 3rd Brigade went off jump status on 1 April 1974, the same date on which the Airmobile Badge (Air Assault Badge as of 4 October 1974) was introduced.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Israel withdrew {{its troops}} from the Gaza Strip and removed the {{thousands}} of Israelis who had settled in the territory. See Israel's unilateral <b>disengagement</b> plan of 2004.

On January 25, 2006, Hamas won a surprise victory in the elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority. In 2007, Hamas overthrew Fatah forces in the Gaza Strip and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response. Currently, Hamas, recognized as a terror organization by most western countries, has de facto control {{of the city and}} Strip.|$|E
30|$|Before {{concluding}} {{we should}} acknowledge {{a number of}} limitations of the current study. First, it should be acknowledged that diary responses reflect relatively coarse measures of attentional <b>disengagements</b> in everyday life. That is, despite the strengths of using diary methods to assess everyday attentional <b>disengagements,</b> there are also clear limitations with these types of studies. For example, given that diary methods require both prospective and retrospective memory and a heavy dependence on meta-awareness {{it is clear that}} not all <b>disengagements</b> will be reported and not all <b>disengagements</b> will be reported entirely accurately or in a timely fashion. Additionally, unlike probe caught methods, diary methods likely underestimate instances of mind-wandering when participants are unaware that they are mind-wandering. As noted by Reason and Lucas (1984) diaries “serve a valuable function as wide-gauge trawl nets, picking up the more salient types of lapse” (p. 56). Furthermore, unlike most probe-caught methods, diaries allow and encourage participants to completely describe each type of <b>disengagements</b> resulting in richer description. Thus, despite limitations, diary methods are particularly useful (especially when combined with laboratory measures and individual differences analyses) in obtaining more naturalistic data.|$|R

30|$|In {{the current}} study we {{examined}} attentional <b>disengagements</b> in educational contexts (in class and while studying) {{in a sample of}} undergraduate students. By attentional <b>disengagements</b> we mean those situations in which attention is disengaged from the primary task (listening to a lecture and taking notes, studying for an upcoming exam, etc.) and is instead allocated to irrelevant internal or external sources (see also Cheyne, Solman, Carriere, & Smilek, 2009). These shifts in attention may be voluntary in which attention is intentionally disengaged from the primary task and instead allocated to other internal (thinking about {{what you have to do}} later; e.g., Seli, Risko, & Smilek, 2016) or external (checking your email on your phone) sources of information. These voluntary shifts are likely linked to motivation and interest such that when one is less motivated and/or less interested in the primary task, attention is allocated to off-task activities (Kanfer & Ackerman, 1989). These shifts may also be involuntary in which attention is disengaged from the primary task due to potent internal (current concerns; Klinger, 2013) or external (loud noises) distractions that capture attention. These involuntary shifts of attention may be linked to overall alertness and arousal levels (Kahneman, 1973) such that when underaroused and bored, less attention is devoted to remaining engaged in the current task, and thus more easily captured by potent distractors (Lenartowicz, Simpson, & Cohen, 2013). Thus, in the current paper we refer to attentional <b>disengagements</b> as situations where students’ attention is disengaged from what they are supposed to be doing (taking notes, studying) to other internal and external sources of information. In prior research we (Unsworth, McMillan, Brewer, & Spillers, 2012) and others referred to these as attentional failures given that attention was supposed to be allocated to a given task, but was instead allocated to irrelevant information resulting in a failure or lapse of attention. However, given that sometimes attention can be voluntarily allocated to things other than the primary task (checking Facebook because I find the lecture boring), we refer to the broad class of situations where attention is allocated to other sources as <b>disengagements</b> rather than as failures (which can be considered as a subclass of overall <b>disengagements).</b>|$|R
30|$|Examining {{relations}} between attentional <b>disengagements</b> and motivation and interest suggested that {{participants who were}} motivated to perform well in their classes tend to mind-wander less when they were bored or disinterested with the course material and tended to mind-wander more about future class performance (such as thinking about an upcoming exam). Participants who reported being interested in their classes {{were less likely to}} self-distract themselves and similar to highly motivated individuals, were more likely to mind-wander about future class performance than individuals who were less interested in their classes. Thus, not only were cognitive abilities associated with individual differences in everyday mind-wandering and distraction, but other person variables, such as motivation to do well and interest in classes, were also predictive of certain types of attentional <b>disengagements.</b>|$|R
5|$|At {{this crucial}} juncture, Abe chose {{to abandon the}} mission and depart the area. Several reasons are conjectured {{as to why he}} made this decision. Much of the special {{bombardment}} ammunition had been expended in the battle. If the bombardment failed to destroy the airfield, then his warships would be vulnerable to CAF air attack at dawn. His own injuries and the deaths of some of his staff from battle action may have affected Abe's judgement. Perhaps he was also unsure as to how many of his or the U.S. ships were still combat-capable because of communication problems with the damaged Hiei. Furthermore, his own ships were scattered and would have taken some time to reassemble for a coordinated resumption of the mission to attack Henderson Field and the remnants of the U.S. warship force. For whatever reason, Abe called for a <b>disengagement</b> and general retreat of his warships, although Yukikaze and Teruzuki remained behind to assist Hiei. Samidare picked up survivors from Yūdachi at 03:00 before joining the other Japanese ships in the retirement northwards.|$|E
5|$|Following the Pakrac {{clash between}} Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March 1991, the {{conflict}} had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence. The JNA stepped in, increasingly supporting the Croatian Serb insurgents. In early April, {{the leaders of}} the Croatian Serb revolt declared their intention to integrate the area under their control, known as SAO Krajina, with Serbia. In May, the Croatian government responded by forming the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde - ZNG), but its development was hampered by a United Nations (UN) arms embargo introduced in September. The Brioni Agreement established an observer mission which was eventually called the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM). The mission was tasked with monitoring the <b>disengagement</b> of belligerents in the Ten-Day War in neighbouring Slovenia, and the withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia. However, on 16 August, an ECMM helicopter was hit by Croatian Serb gunfire in western Slavonia, injuring one of the pilots. This caused the ECMM's scope of work to be formally expanded to include Croatia on 1 September.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, it {{was decided}} by the University of Melbourne that Burnet would be {{appointed}} a professor {{as part of a}} cooperative program so that university students could be experimentally trained at the institute, while the researchers engaged in some teaching. This was not a success, and there was much tension, as Burnet repeatedly expressed his opinion in public that university teaching and research should be kept separate, at one point leading to a series of open letters from university professors decrying his attitude. Burnet was also not interested in the politics of university funding, and his <b>disengagement</b> from administrative matters engendered resentment. On the other hand, Burnet was vigorous in obtaining funding for the Hall Institute from government bodies, resorting to the bluff of feigning interest in moving overseas to secure continued strong backing. However, he was criticised for being thrifty and refusing to invest in cutting edge equipment, despite the Hall Institute's high standing in research circles. Colleagues believed that he was sceptical of modern technology and thought his outlook to be limiting.|$|E
40|$|We {{have noted}} that {{participants}} in meetings disengage from the conversation when they perform tasks with information resources such as laptop computers or pen and paper.

On {{the basis of these}} two features, we have outlined a model of paper-based task performance during meetings.

30|$|In {{a unique}} {{approach}} to studying attention <b>disengagements</b> in educational contexts, we combined diary methods with laboratory assessments of various cognitive abilities and questionnaires indexing motivation {{and interest in}} current classes in a large sample of participants. In a sample of undergraduate students we found that students experience {{a number of different}} attentional <b>disengagements</b> both during lecture and while studying throughout the course of a typical week. Specifically, we found that distractions were slightly more frequent than mind-wandering, and more <b>disengagements</b> occurred in class than while studying. Note, a potential issue with this analysis is that it assumes that equal amounts of time are spent in class and while studying. Unfortunately, we did not have a measure of how much time was spent in each, so the main effect of context may simply reflect the fact that more time is spent studying than in class. Future research is needed to better examine how amount of time in each influences the results. Additionally, we found that these factors interacted such that rates of distraction were similar in both class and while studying, but mind-wandering was more frequent during lecture than while studying. This reduction in mind-wandering during study could reflect the fact that during study students frequently interrupt themselves and attempt to multitask via self-distractions with technology (Calderwood et al., 2014). Thus, during study participants may be directing their attention to other external activities (checking email, checking Facebook, listening to music, etc.) rather than engaging in mind-wandering. These results are consistent with prior diary work suggesting that distraction while studying and mind-wandering during lectures are two potent forms of attentional <b>disengagements</b> (Unsworth, McMillan, et al., 2012). Furthermore, although much prior research has examined mind-wandering or distraction in educational contexts, the current work demonstrates the importance of examining these two types of lapses together to get a better sense of their relative frequencies and how they change in different contexts (in class or while studying). Collectively, the current results replicate and extend prior research by demonstrating that mind-wandering and distraction are frequently occurring <b>disengagements</b> of attention for students in different educational contexts (Brown, 1927, Cameron & Giuntoli, 1972; Fried, 2008; Geerligs, 1995; Lindquist & McLean, 2011; Schoen, 1970; Tesch et al., 2011; Sana et al., 2013; Shelton et al., 2009; Unsworth, McMillan, et al., 2012; Wammes, Boucher, et al., 2016).|$|R

The breakthrough in the centre of the Allied front surprised the Germans, when they were distracted by the Allied attacks {{at both ends of the}} Normandy bridgehead. By the time of the American breakout at Avranches, there was little to no reserve strength left for Unternehmen Lüttich (Operation Liège), the German counter-offensive, which had been defeated by 12 August, leaving the 7th Army with no choice but to retire rapidly east of the Orne river, with a rearguard of the remaining armoured and motorised units, to allow time for the surviving infantry to reach the Seine. After the first stage of the withdrawal beyond the Orne, the manoeuvre collapsed for a lack of fuel, Allied air attacks and the constant pressure of the Allied armies, culminating in the encirclement of German forces in the Falaise pocket.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{bombing of}} North Vietnam in February 1965 had a decisive {{impact on the}} Soviet Union's {{strategy}} in Vietnam. Since Ho Chi Minh and his Communist Party won control of North Vietnam in 1954, Ho's government had not always enjoyed cordial relations with their Soviet allies. For example, in 1957 the Soviet government proposed that both North and South Vietnam be given {{a seat in the}} United Nations, a move which would have undermined the North's claim as the sole legitimate government of the whole country. Then in February 1964, North Vietnam joined the People's Republic of China in refusing to sign the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was an insult to the policy of co-existence adopted by the then Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. By that time, however, Khrushchev had already begun the process of <b>disengagement</b> from Vietnam because of the growing conflict in the region was becoming more expensive for the Soviet Union, with North Vietnam relying more on it for large amounts of economic and military aid.|$|E

30|$|Examining end of {{the term}} grades {{suggested}} that classes that were associated with higher motivation ratings were also associated with higher grades. Additionally, replicating prior research, we found that intelligence (here, fluid intelligence) and motivation successfully predicted {{end of the}} term grades (Kuncel et al., 2004; Spinath et al., 2006; Steinmayr & Spinath, 2009). Mind-wandering assessed in the laboratory was also predictive of end of the term grades, but this relation was primarily due to shared variance with fluid intelligence and motivation. Once all three measures were examined together, only fluid intelligence and motivation accounted for unique variance in end of the term GPA. Interestingly, none of the everyday attentional <b>disengagements</b> from the diaries were correlated with GPA. The lack of relations {{may be due to}} the fact that our only measure of academic performance was end of the term GPA which might not be sensitive to in-the-moment <b>disengagements.</b> Indeed, Wammes, Seli, et al. (2016) found that mind-wandering during lectures was related to exam and quiz scores, but not to overall GPA. Given that students can study for exams outside of class, and many final grades are based on a combination of quizzes, exams, and final projects, it is possible that in-the-moment attentional <b>disengagements</b> lead to poor learning and retention, but students engage in other activities to obtain better grades. Indeed, an interesting finding from the current study was that high-fluid-intelligence individuals tended to self-distract more than low-fluid-intelligence individuals. Yet, high-fluid-intelligence individuals also tended to get better grades than low-fluid-intelligence individuals. Thus, these high-fluid-intelligence individuals may deliberately disengage and self-distract themselves knowing that they can obtain the desired grade by studying harder or putting extra effort into final projects.|$|R
