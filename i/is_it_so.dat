500|$|Lyrically {{the track}} is written about a failing {{relationship}} {{caused by a}} partner who abuses alcohol. The singer speaks {{of a man who}} faces a disconnect between his personality while drunk and sober, causing the inability to forge a connection. During the second verse Gomez sings [...] "Why <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> different when we wake up? / Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch / Don't you know that you do it just enough, but not enough / But I know what's next, and I want so much", describing a lover who can only show his true emotions while intoxicated. Later in the song she expresses the pain she feels having wasted so much time into her relationship, and decides to leave her dysfunctional lover: [...] "You've got a hold on me / You're like a wasted dream / I gave you everything / But you don't know how to love me when you're sober".|$|E
500|$|In {{reporting}} on Ballo's death, United Press International noted, [...] "Critics say the break-you-down-build-you-up recruitment tool of Scientologists is controversial." [...] The issue received {{a significant amount}} of coverage in Norway news publications; and media attention focused criticism on the Church of Scientology. Both Verdens Gang and Dagbladet devoted several cover stories investigating the matter. News media received criticism regarding the amount of coverage given to the incident. A representative of the National Association for Suicide Survivors in Norway regarded it as excessive. News editor of Dagbladet, Peter Raaum, defended the amount of news coverage given to the incident: [...] "We write about this because the survivor has made criticism of the Scientology test that Kaja took just before she took her life. The family wanted a debate about this. What makes this so important is this test. What kind of test is this? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> reprehensible, and significant to what happened? If it is, I mean it's something that's extremely important to focus on." [...] Ballo's family agreed to discuss the incident with the media. In an interview Ballo's father said he did not have issues with the case being front-page news in newspapers.|$|E

500|$|Amidst {{the fourth}} season, the romance between Dan and Blair became a {{polarizing}} topic among viewers which also drew significant media interest. Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post applauded the development, feeling that Blair had [...] "more chemistry" [...] with Dan than with Chuck. New York magazine's Chris Rovzar called Blair and Dan's story line [...] "believable", citing their common ground {{in education and}} taste. Rovzar further stated, [...] "Since {{they live in a}} world where both only seem to have half a dozen real friends (if that), <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> crazy they'd end up together?" [...] An article from The Huffington Post declared that [...] "Dan and Blair together are like Harry Burns and Sally Albright reincarnated — the couple was obviously inspired by When Harry Met Sally." [...] It further commented that the couple paralleled Pacey and Joey’s relationship from Dawson's Creek and concluded that Dan and Blair were [...] "the most inspired storyline and couple of the show". Entertainment Weekly stated that Dan and Blair were like stars in an [...] "updated version of You've Got Mail". Tierney Bricker of E! ranked all 25 Gossip Girl couples placing 'Dair' as the third best couple after Blair and Serena (#1) and 'Chair' (#2). Bricker stated that “, out of all the main characters, were the most well-suited for each other. In real life, they would've been 'endgame'." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 13, 2009, it was {{reported}} that a [...] "secret Michael Jackson single" [...] was being produced to promote the film Michael Jackson's This <b>Is</b> <b>It,</b> <b>so</b> that the song's release would coincide with the release of [...] the film. It {{was reported}} that Jackson had planned to release the song for his planned concerts but after his death it was shelved until producers in Los Angeles, California decided to remix the vocals with an orchestral accompaniment. On September 23, Sony Music Entertainment announced they were planning on releasing a song entitled, [...] "This Is It" [...] as a single. The song was to feature backing vocals by several of Jackson's brothers [...] and would be included in a two-disc album, This Is It. It was also confirmed that the song would be featured during the end credits of the movie production. Sony said, in response to the reports, that it was a coincidence that his upcoming concert series was also titled [...] "This Is It," [...] explaining they had no evidence that he had planned to release the song. However, John McClain and John Branca, two representatives of Jackson's estate said, in a prepared statement, that [...] "This Is It" [...] was [...] "picked because the lyrics were appropriate because of the name Michael [...] gave his tour" [...] and that they were [...] "thrilled to present" [...] the song.|$|E

2500|$|This term is {{at least}} nine hundred years old in English: {{physicians}} and surgeons were once members of separate professions, and traditionally were rivals.

2500|$|In {{its early}} release in the United States, many American critics {{dismissed}} Fires on the Plain as a gratuitously bleak anti-war film. In 1963, The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther gave the film a quite harsh description, writing [...] "Never have I seen a more grisly and physically repulsive film than Fires on the Plain." [...] He continued, [...] "So purposefully putrid <b>is</b> <b>it,</b> <b>so</b> full of degradation and death... that I doubt {{if anyone can}} sit through it without becoming a little bit ill... That's how horrible it is." [...] He notes however, [...] "this {{is a tribute to}} its maker, for it is perfectly obvious to me that Kon Ichikawa, the director, intended it to be a brutally realistic contemplation of one aspect of war." [...] He points out, [...] "...with all the horror in it, there are snatches of poetry, too..." [...] He ends the review commenting that the only audience who would enjoy the film were those with bitter memories towards the Japanese held over from World War II.|$|E
