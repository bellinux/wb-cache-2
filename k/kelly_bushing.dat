(King) Kelly, a Chicago {{baseball}} player (1880-1887) who {{was known for his}} base running and long slides.″ [...] As steel was not as good a quality back then as it was today, the kelly was always hanging up in the <b>kelly</b> <b>bushing.</b> There was a popular song for the famous baseball player at that time called, ″Slide Kelly, Slide!″ [...] ″Sliding″ is the act of a kelly passing through the <b>kelly</b> <b>bushing</b> as it drills.|$|E
50|$|The {{kelly is}} the {{polygonal}} tubing and the <b>kelly</b> <b>bushing</b> is the mechanical device that turns the kelly when rotated by the rotary table. Together they {{are referred to}} as a kelly drive. The upper end of the kelly is screwed into the swivel, using a left-hand thread to preclude loosening from the right-hand torque applied below. The kelly typically is about 10 ft (3 m) longer than the drill pipe segments, thus leaving a portion of newly drilled hole open below the bit after a new length of pipe has been added ("making a connection") and the drill string has been lowered until the <b>kelly</b> <b>bushing</b> engages again in the rotary table.|$|E

5000|$|The acronym TVDSS is {{commonly}} used {{in the oil industry}} to represent TVD minus the elevation above mean sea level of the depth reference point of the well. The depth reference point is the <b>kelly</b> <b>bushing</b> in the United States and a few other nations, but is the drill floor in most places.|$|E
5000|$|Because wells are {{not always}} drilled vertically, there may be two [...] "depths" [...] for every given point in a wellbore: the {{measured}} depth (MD) measured along {{the path of the}} borehole, and the true vertical depth (TVD), the absolute vertical distance between the datum and the point in the wellbore. In perfectly vertical wells, the TVD equals the MD; otherwise, the TVD is less than the MD measured from the same datum. Common datums used are ground level (GL), drilling rig floor (DF), rotary table (RT), <b>kelly</b> <b>bushing</b> (KB) and mean sea level (MSL).|$|E
30|$|A {{suite of}} well logs that {{included}} gamma ray (GR), sonic velocity (Vp), bulk density (Rho), neutron porosity (NPHI), density porosity (DPHI) and caliper logs were sourced from 13 wells. The wells were chosen {{because they have}} good quality log data and wide coverage of the basin, {{making it possible for}} each of the depobelts to be represented in the study. The logs were quality checked with caliper logs for consistency of wellbore diameter. This makes it possible to identify and edit out sections of the logs that were compromised by borehole rugosity. Log headers were checked for depth datum (i.e. whether the quoted depths were relative to <b>Kelly</b> <b>Bushing,</b> subsea or along hole, etc.) and further verified from composite logs and well files. Where necessary, conversions were made from any of the differing depth references to the true vertical depth subsea (TVDSS) format that was uniformly used in the study. Because of the need to work with consistent sand and shale properties, the top and base of main sand and shale units were also delineated from the composite logs and well reports. Considering that the average geothermal gradient of the basin is 25  °C/km, data were taken from well sections that were not expected to be greatly affected by diagenetic mineralogical alterations and late overpressure processes which are mostly active when temperatures tend to exceed 70  °C. Moreover, velocity and density logs of shales were visually examined for consistency of mechanical compaction behaviour (i.e. a general trend of similar density and velocity behaviours with depth).|$|E
50|$|Green bans {{were first}} {{conducted}} in Australia in the 1970s by the New South Wales Builders Labourers Federation (BLF). Green bans were never instigated unilaterally by the BLF, all green bans {{were at the}} request of, and in support of, residents' groups. The first green ban {{was put in place}} to protect <b>Kelly's</b> <b>Bush,</b> the last remaining undeveloped bushland in the Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill. A group of local women who had already appealed to the local council, mayor, and the Premier of New South Wales, approached the BLF for help. The BLF asked the women to call a public meeting, which was attended by 600 residents, and formally asked the BLF to prevent construction on the site. The developer, A V Jennings, announced that they would use non-union labour as strike-breakers. In response, BLF members on other A V Jennings construction projects stopped work. A V Jennings eventually abandoned all plans to develop <b>Kelly's</b> <b>Bush.</b>|$|R

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScThe Bredasdorp basin is a {{sub-basin}} of {{the greater}} Outeniqua basin. It is located off the south coast, Southeast of Cape Town, South Africa. This basin {{is one of the}} largest hydrocarbon (mainly gas) producing basins within Southern Africa. The petrophysical characteristic of the E-block sandstone units within the Bredasdorp basin has been studied to evaluate their hydrocarbon potential. The data sets used in this research were wireline logs (Las format), core data, and geological well completion reports. The three studied wells are E-AH 1, E- BW 1 and E-L 1. The evaluated interval ranges from 2000. 33 m to 3303. 96 m in depth with reference to <b>Kelly</b> <b>bushing</b> within the wells. The sandstone reservoirs of the Bredarsdorp basin are characterized by a range of stacked and amalgamated channels. They originated from materials eroded from pre-existing high stand shelf sandstone and transported into the central Bredarsdorp basin by turbidity current. These sandstones are generally in both synrift and drift section. The basin is thought to have developed from fan deltas and stream overwhelmed to water dominated delta. River dominated deltaic system progresses southward over the Northern edge of the central Bredasdorp basin. The Interactive Petrophysics (IP) software has been used extensively throughout the evaluation and development of interpretation model. The lithofacies of the rock units were grouped according to textural and structural features and grain sizes of well (E-AH 1, E-BW 1 and E-L 1). Four different facies (A, B, C and D) were identified from the cored intervals of each well. Facies A was classified as a reservoir and facies B, C and D as a non-reservoir. Detailed petrophysical analyses were carried out on the selected sandstone interval of the studied wells. The cut-off parameters were applied on the seven studied sandstone interval to distinguish between pay and non-pay sand and all intervals were proved to be producing hydrocarbon. Volume of clay, porosity, water saturation and permeability were calculated within the pay sand interval. The average volume of clay ranged from 23. 4 % to 25. 4 %. The estimated average effective porosity ranged from 9. 47 % to 14. 3 %. The average water saturation ranged from 44. 4 % to 55. 6 %. Permeability ranged from 0. 14 mD to 79 mD. The storage and flow capacity ranged from 183. 2 scf to 3852 scf and 2. 758 mD-ft to 3081 mD-ft respectively. The geological well completion reports classify these wells as a gas producing wells. E-L 1 is estimated to have a potential recoverable gas volume of 549. 06 cubic feet, E-BW 1 is estimated to have 912. 49 cubic feet and E-AH 1 is estimated to have 279. 69 cubic feet...|$|E
40|$|Summary When {{drilling}} the {{top hole}} section {{in deep water}} regions, alternative methods to the conventional riserless drilling system may be employed to avoid the "Pump and Dump" strategy. Conventional drilling with riser is not beneficial to use in top hole drilling with no blowout preventer (BOP) installed. It was used until 1985 but today it is avoided due to security reasons. Drilling the top hole section and recirculating the drilling fluid back to the rig can be applied by utilizing the low riser return system (LRRS) or the riserless mud recovery (RMR) system. In the LRRS an adjustable pump is located a certain distance below the sea level, mainly to reduce the hydrostatic column of mud in the well. In this situation the mud pressure at seabed may be adjusted to equal the sea water pressure. In case of a disconnection the well pressure will then be maintained even without a BOP installed. In the RMR system the mud column starts at seabed and the seawater column above the mudline will not influence the maximum allowable mud weight {{to be used in}} contrast to a conventional riser system. Therefore, the smaller pressure window in deep water due to the relatively larger column of seawater will be neutralized when applying the LRRS and the RMR system. To control a shallow gas zone when utilizing a conventional riser system a certain static mud pressure is needed. In addition the calculated dynamic mud pressure must not fracture the formation. To avoid fracturing the conductor has to be set at the depth where the dynamic mud pressure equals the equivalent fracture gradient. When utilizing the LRRS and the RMR system, the equivalent fracture gradient at conductor setting depth will not decide the maximum allowable dynamic mud weight to be used, since the mud column is not starting from rotary <b>kelly</b> <b>bushing</b> (RKB). Then a higher mud weight may be used which results in easier controlling of the shallow gas zone, even with a lower conductor setting depth. In addition the top hole length will be extended. The main advantage using the LRRS compared to the RMR system is that the bottom hole pressure quickly can be changed by adjusting the fluid level in the riser, hence a shallow gas influx can be controlled rapidly. However, the change in bottom hole pressure is limited by the narrow gap in pore and fracture pressure at the conductor setting depth when drilling the top hole. Still it may be determining in controlling an unexpected shallow gas zone with high overpressure. The main advantage of the RMR system compared to the LRRS is that the conventional marine drilling riser is avoided which is a benefit regarding the rig capacity. Then a smaller mud volume is needed and the necessary supported weight from the rig is reduced. These differences will be larger as the water depth increases. In addition, the amount of gas entering the well is difficult to stop in a LRRS. When gas rises using the LRRS it must be diverted through the diverter line. When gas rises in a RMR system it will most likely be diverted away by the water currents. Further work may be applied, listed in the following stages:. Compose a drilling program to calculate the increasing benefits of using a RMR system when the water depth enlarges.. Compose a drilling program to calculate how quickly a shallow gas zone may be controlled with a LRRS compared to a RMR system. </p...|$|E
