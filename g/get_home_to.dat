A robber bursts into the store and shoots at Woods, but Apu saves him by jumping in front of the bullet.

Miss One urges her to follow the yellow brick road to the capital Emerald City and seek {{the help of the}} mysterious [...] "Wizard" [...] who she believes holds the power to send Dorothy back to Harlem.

500|$|Tucker McCall (Stephen Nichols) {{is later}} seen with a {{photograph}} of Genevieve as a teenager, revealing that the two dated before she ran off to Australia with Colin. When Victor goes missing, Tucker enlists Genevieve’s help and promises to reward her if she does. Genevieve finds Victor in Los Angeles suffering from amnesia. [...] Victor believes his name is [...] "Christian." [...] Genevieve poses as a barmaid, calling herself Jenny, so she can watch Victor. [...] After Victor regains his memory, Genevieve helps him <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> Genoa City. After their return, Genevieve is shunned by the town for keeping Victor away. Afterward, someone began impersonating Samantha, and when Cane found the woman, she insisted that Genevieve put her up to this. Genevieve denied any involvement but was convinced Colin was behind the plot. When the woman's hotel room was found trashed with blood on the floor, Ronan Malloy (Jeff Branson) considered Genevieve a suspect. Fearing conviction for something she didn't do, {{she was able to}} get Tucker's help to disappear; they shared a heartfelt goodbye before she left town.|$|E

500|$|Smithers {{was partly}} {{based on how}} {{numerous}} Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' orientation was pitched by Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but the writers should never draw {{too much attention to}} it and should try to keep it {{in the back of their}} heads. [...] Jay Kogen said [...] "Originally he was gay and black...But we thought it was too much so we just kept him gay." [...] The script for [...] "Blood Feud" [...] originally featured Smithers saying [...] "Just leave me enough to <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> my wife and kids", but the line had to be cut for time. Smithers is voiced by Harry Shearer, who is also the voice of Mr. Burns. Shearer is often able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Dan Castellaneta occasionally fills in for Shearer at table reads and voices Smithers. The name Waylon was first used in [...] "I Married Marge" [...] and comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Chris Robinson, and was shot in West Hollywood at [...] "The London". It premiered on MTV on January 28, 2010. French fashion model Noemie Lenoir portrays Usher's love interest. Like the album version of the song, the music video does not feature Plies or his verse. In the video, Usher struggles to <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> his wife, however due to several obligations and his partying, he cannot make it. Previous shots are given of Usher and Lenoir in a brown backdrop, and assumed previous situations of their love life and Usher coming home. Scenes are seen with Usher in a boardroom setting, and then teaching dance {{to a group of}} women in a studio, then in a club. Several instances in the video are unknown as in the scene in which Usher takes a phone call, unknown to the viewer for [...] "business or pleasure," [...] as explained by James Montgomery of MTV News. In describing the video, he went on to say, [...] "...you can kind of see why it'd be about both. Such is the life he's chosen, and now he must deal with the repercussions." [...] In following scenes the threat of infidelity is seen even clearer as Usher gets close to the [...] "over-friendly dancers" [...] and [...] "sipping — and spitting — champagne in a place that looks very much like a strip club." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{discovering}} a mutual interest in racing, McQueen and Great Escape co-star James Garner became good friends. Garner lived downhill from McQueen, who recalled: [...] "I {{could see that}} Jim was neat around his place. Flowers trimmed, no papers in the yard... grass always cut. So to piss him off, I'd start lobbing empty beer cans down the hill into his driveway. He'd have his drive all spic 'n' span {{when he left the}} house, then <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> find all these empty cans. Took him a long time to figure out it was me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two {{days before}} his high school {{graduation}} ceremony in 1941, he got an offer to go on tour with the Dick Barry band, so he traveled with them to New Jersey. He quickly was fired from the band after two gigs because he couldn't sight-read music well enough. Stranded in New Jersey because he didn't {{have enough money to}} <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> Nebraska, he finally joined Bob Astor's band. [...] Shelly Manne, drummer with Bob Astor at the time, recalled that even then Hefti's writing skills were quite impressive: ...|$|E
2500|$|Unable to play {{high school}} hockey in {{southern}} California, Chelios wasn't recruited by any U.S. colleges. His only scholarship offer came from local San Diego-based United States International University, the only NCAA Division I hockey team {{west of the}} Rockies. But when Chelios arrived on campus as a freshman in 1979 he soon realized {{he was in the}} wrong environment, facing bigger players with considerably more junior hockey experience. He was eventually cut from the team and considered quitting hockey. Instead, he tried his luck in Canada, where he was twice cut by Junior B teams in Canada and hit a low point when he had to borrow money from strangers to <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> California one year. Chelios said, [...] "I wasn't any bigger or any better than the other guys, so they weren't going to take a kid from the States when they could have a local guy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scully {{has endured}} {{a pair of}} {{personal}} tragedies in his life. In 1972, his 35-year-old wife, Joan Crawford, died of an accidental medical overdose; the couple {{had been married for}} 15 years. In late 1973, he married Sandra Hunt, who had two children of her own, and they soon had a child together. Scully's eldest son, Michael, died in a helicopter crash at the age of 33 while working for the ARCO Transportation Company. He was inspecting oil pipelines for leaks near Fort Tejon, California {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Northridge earthquake in January 1994. Although Michael's death still haunts him, Scully, a devout Roman Catholic, has said in numerous interviews that he credits his Catholic faith and being able to dive back into his work with helping him ease the burden and grief from losing his wife and son. He has encouraged devotion to the Virgin Mary, saying, [...] "her prayers are more powerful than those of the rest of heaven combined. No one was closer or more devoted to Christ on earth, so it only makes sense to see the same thing in heaven. Now, the Blessed Virgin seeks to help her spiritual children <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> spend eternity with her Son." ...|$|E
