40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been growing {{concerns}} about online sexual solicitations and online sexual risk behaviors. Recent studies suggest that {{only a minority of}} adolescents is confronted with online sexual solicitations or engages <b>in</b> online <b>sexual</b> risk behavior. Whereas more girls encounter incidences of online sexual solicitations, gender differences <b>in</b> online <b>sexual</b> risk behavior are relatively small. Older adolescents are more at risk of receiving online sexual solicitations and {{are also more likely to}} engage <b>in</b> online <b>sexual</b> risk behavior. Adolescents do not engage <b>in</b> online <b>sexual</b> risk behavior more frequently than adults, and they seem to be quite aware of the potential negative consequences of this behavior.

40|$|Although {{adolescent}} {{sexual activity}} {{is a topic}} of much concern, research has concentrated on the negative correlates of teenage sexual activity. This paper examines the differences between adolescents who engage <b>in</b> risky <b>sexual</b> intercourse versus those who engage <b>in</b> mature <b>sexual</b> activity, using a maturity scale that encompasses frequency and type of contraceptive use, number of sexual partners, and frequency of intercourse. Analyses are based on self and peer reports of 22 male and 26 female sexually active teenagers out of a sample of 138 moderately at-risk adolescents surveyed. Results indicate that adolescents who are sexually active {{do not appear to}} be less competent than adolescents who abstain from sexual intercourse. Furthermore, adolescents who engage <b>in</b> more mature <b>sexual</b> activity are perceived as more likeable and less aggressive by their peers, as compared to teenagers engaging <b>in</b> risky <b>sexual</b> activity. Mature sexual behavior was also predicted by positive self-reports of social competence as broadly defined, although dimensions related to self esteem were not related to maturity. These findings suggest that adolescents who are sexually active are not less socially competent than abstaining teenagers, and that, among those who are sexually active, teenagers engaging <b>in</b> mature <b>sexual</b> activity are more competent than adolescents who engage <b>in</b> risky <b>sexual</b> behaviors...|$|R

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores can result <b>in</b> <b>sexual</b> reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within {{a relatively short}} radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other insects, P.exclamans use sexual pheromones to attract members of the {{opposite}} sex. Researchers have attempted to determine the exact role that sexual pheromones play <b>in</b> <b>sexual</b> attraction in paper wasps.

These pheromones were taken by hexane extracts from wholes bodies and thoraces of unmated females. The male extracts {{were taken from the}} ectal mandibular and seventh sternal glands. It was found that the opposite sex was attracted upwind of the scent and the results were intensified when a fan was turned on. The range of the scent was found to be around 2 metres.|$|E
