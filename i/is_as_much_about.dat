25|$|In {{very nearly}} hiding {{one of the}} girl's faces and subjugating the {{characterization}} of individuals to more formal compositional considerations, The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the subject of childhood as it {{is an example of}} portraiture.|$|E
25|$|Oroonoko is {{the first}} English novel to show Africans in a {{sympathetic}} manner. At the same time, this novel <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the nature of kingship {{as it is about}} the nature of race. Oroonoko is a prince, and he is of noble lineage whether of African or European descent, and the novel's regicide is devastating to the colony. The theatrical nature of the plot follows from Behn's previous experience as a dramatist. The language she uses in Oroonoko is far more straightforward than in her other novels, and she dispenses {{with a great deal of}} the emotional content of her earlier works. Further, the novel is unusual in Behn's fictions by having a very clear love story without complications of gender roles.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{agree that}} Skin & Bone <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> Los Angeles {{and the film}} {{industry}} {{as it is about}} prostitution or even homosexuality. [...] Writing in Bright Lights Film Journal, critic Gary Morris suggests that the film is [...] "inevitably set in Los Angeles, amid that city's arid strip malls, newsstands, and endless dusty streets" [...] and he points to the significance of Ghislaine's constant movement through the city, [...] "looking glamorous and inscrutable in her opaque sunglasses".|$|E

500|$|The {{style of}} the Rights of Men mirrors much of Burke's own text. It has no clear structure; like Reflections, the text follows the mental {{associations}} made by the author as she was writing. Wollstonecraft's political treatise is written, like Burke's, {{in the form of}} a letter: his to C. J. F. DePont, a young Frenchman, and hers to Burke himself. Using the same form, metaphors, and style as Burke, she turns his own argument back on him. The Rights of Men <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> language and argumentation as it is about political theory; in fact, Wollstonecraft claims that these are inseparable. She advocates, as one scholar writes, [...] "simplicity and honesty of expression, and argument employing reason rather than eloquence." [...] At the beginning of the pamphlet, she appeals to Burke: [...] "Quitting now the flowers of rhetoric, let us, Sir, reason together." ...|$|E
500|$|Caesar A. Montevecchio of the University of Notre Dame {{published}} a theological {{assessment of the}} spiritual themes in the film concentrating on the act of priestly renunciation depicted towards the end stating: [...] "This climactic scene of Rodrigues trampling the fumie makes clear that Silence <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the object of Christian faith {{as it is the}} experience of that faith. As ambient and live sound are washed out entirely, Rodrigues hears the voice of Christ telling him to trample, that it was to be trampled upon that Christ came into the world. The object of faith becomes a Christ who is a hero of pity, who takes up the weakness and suffering of humankind as his cross, rather than a hero of triumphant resolve. The Jesus of Silence is one of utter kenosis (self-emptying), and one who in the mercy of that kenosis radically sympathizes with the weakness, and frailty, of human beings, even ones like Judas and Kichijiro." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening {{episode of}} Sense and Sensibility {{features}} the moment Willoughby seduces Eliza, a young schoolgirl. Davies told Carey and Claire Hill from the Western Mail {{that he wanted}} [...] "to do justice" [...] to Willoughby's back story, {{saying that it is}} [...] "quite interesting and steamy stuff like a lot of underage sex that goes on and is just talked about. I want {{to put it on the}} screen." [...] Davies elaborated on this further in an interview with The Independent's Peter Chapman, saying that the seduction and abandonment of a schoolgirl in the novel needed dramatising. He believed readers [...] "hardly notice" [...] the moment, which he felt was very important. The writer noted that the series was [...] "more overtly sexual" [...] than previous adaptations of Austen's works and added, [...] "The novel <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> sex and money as social conventions." [...] Davies also included a duel between Colonel Brandon and Willoughby in his screenplay, an event that was absent from Lee's film adaptation of the novel.|$|E
50|$|Tim Palmer explores Denis' {{work as a}} self-declared formalist and {{brilliant}} film stylist per se; an approach the filmmaker herself has declared many times in interview to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> sounds, textures, colors and compositions as broader thematic concerns or social commitments.|$|R
5000|$|... "She" [...] is the Columbia River. The song {{is really}} an ode to the river <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the dam - rather like the way some popular {{versions}} of the [...] "Wabash Cannonball" [...] seem to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> that tall glamorous girl from Tennessee, as about the train.|$|R
40|$|Although {{scholars}} are often encouraged {{to promote their}} research online, institutional recognition of networked scholarship often appears to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> control and surveillance as about integrating public scholarship into academic criteria for success. George Veletsianos argues staff members, faculty, and administrators {{need to work together}} to devise forward-thinking policies that take into account the complex realities present in networked spaces...|$|R
500|$|Yet another {{interpretation}} is that Dylan is directing the farewell to himself, particularly his acoustic performer self. The opening line [...] "You must leave now" [...] {{can be a}} command, similar to the line [...] "Go away from my window" [...] that opens [...] "It Ain't Me, Babe". But {{it can also be}} an imperative, meaning just that it is necessary that you leave. And the song <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> new beginnings as it is about endings. The song not only notes the requirement that Baby Blue leave, but also includes the hope that Baby Blue will move forward, in lines such as [...] "Strike another match, go start anew". If Dylan is singing the song to himself, then he himself would be the [...] "vagabond who's rapping at your door / standing in the clothes that you once wore". That is, the new, electric, surrealist Dylan would be the vagabond, not yet having removed the [...] "clothes" [...] of the old protest singer. Alternatively, the vagabond and [...] "stepping stones" [...] referenced in the song have been interpreted as Dylan's folk audience whom he needs to leave behind. He would also be telling himself to [...] "Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you." [...] Others to whom he may be saying farewell in the song are any of the women he had known, the political left or to the illusions of his youth.|$|E
500|$|... "Machine Gun" [...] {{is another}} song that Hendrix had {{spent more time}} developing. [...] By the Fillmore East concerts, it became an {{extended}} guitar improvisational piece, which [...] "would completely change the perception of Hendrix's capabilities as an improviser and musician", according to Shadwick. [...] Although based on a [...] "minor drone-blues" [...] {{in the line of}} [...] "Voodoo Child (Slight Return)", Hendrix's performance has been compared to jazz saxophonist John Coltrane's approach to improvisation. [...] Miles Davis, with whom Coltrane had recorded several albums in the 1950s, including the influential Kind of Blue, noted the connection: [...] "Jimi liked what I had done with Kind of Blue and some other stuff and wanted to add more jazz elements to what he was doing. [...] He liked the way Coltrane played with all those sheets of sound, and played his guitar in a similar way". [...] From Hendrix's dedication of the song [...] "to all the soldiers that are fighting in Chicago and Milwaukee and New York, oh yes, and all the soldiers fighting in Vietnam", [...] "Machine Gun" [...] <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the late 1960s American race riots as the war in Vietnam. [...] Guitarist Vernon Reid describes it as [...] "like a movie about war without the visuals. [...] It had everything—the lyrics, the humanism of it, the drama of it, the violence of it, the eeriness of it, [...] the unpredictability of it". [...] In many commentaries about Band of Gypsys, [...] "Machine Gun" [...] is singled out as the highlight of the album. [...] Both McDermott and Shadwick call it one of Hendrix's greatest achievements, which sets a standard {{that the rest of the}} album does not approach.|$|E
2500|$|The Last Holiday <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> {{his life}} {{as it is about}} context, the theater of late 20th century America — from Jim Crow to the Reagan '80s and from Beale Street to 57th Street. The {{narrative}} is not, however, a rise-and-fall retelling of Scott-Heron's life and career. It doesn't connect all the dots. It moves off-the-beat, at its own speed ... This approach to revelation lends the book an episodic quality, like oral storytelling does. It winds around, it repeats itself.|$|E
50|$|In {{the time}} of the New Testament the person acting <b>as</b> a {{physician}} <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> healing the soul as the body. Apostolic healing is claimed to have occurred where-by people are thought to have been healed by miracles, in the same vien as Jesus of Nazareth who healed the sick by miracles also, and even raised a man from the dead.|$|R

5000|$|Passarello's second collection, Animals Strike Curious Poses (Sarabande 2017), is a bestiary {{of celebrity}} animals. From Jeoffry the Cat to Koko the Gorilla to Dürer’s rhinoceros, these essays <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the animals <b>as</b> the humans who named and {{interact}} with them. The book's title comes from Prince's 1984 single [...] "When Doves Cry." [...] The book received favorable reviews from The New York Times, Publisher's Weekly, and Booklist.|$|R
2500|$|In many ways, proper {{conservation}} <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> research and documentation {{as it is}} about ‘hands-on’ conservation treatments and restoration (Sloan 1993, 27). [...] The conservator must be familiar with not only the general materials with which he or she is working, but also the details specific to the project at hand, in order to understand and address the needs of a particular window or building. [...] Using this knowledge, conservators can develop a conservation plan that can be used throughout the project, to ensure that all decisions are made with the aims of the project and the needs of the object in mind (CVMA 2004).|$|E
6000|$|They {{should have}} been added by the poet in his own person, instead of being put {{into the mouth of}} a {{shepherd}} who is not presumed to have any knowledge of the previous pieces. The specific character which Pope ascribes to each of his Pastorals is not borne out by the poems themselves. There <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> [...] "flocks" [...] in the first Pastoral as in the second; and there <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> [...] "rural lays and loves" [...] in the second Pastoral as in the first. The third Pastoral contains no mention of a [...] "sylvan crew," [...] but a couple of shepherds are absorbed by the same [...] "rural lays and loves" [...] which occupied their predecessors.] ...|$|E
60|$|Shaw and all {{the other}} Ibsenites were fond of insisting that a defect in the romantic drama was its {{tendency}} to end with wedding-bells. Against this they set the modern drama of middle-age, the drama which described marriage itself instead of its poetic preliminaries. Now if Bernard Shaw had been more patient with popular tradition, more prone to think that there might be some sense in its survival, he might have seen this particular problem much more clearly. The old playwrights have left us plenty of plays of marriage and middle-age. Othello <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> what follows the wedding-bells as The Doll's House. Macbeth is about a middle-aged couple as much as Little Eyolf. But if we ask ourselves what is the real difference, we shall, I think, find that it can fairly be stated thus. The old tragedies of marriage, though not love stories, are like love stories in this, that they work up to some act or stroke which is irrevocable as marriage is irrevocable; to the fact of death or of adultery.|$|E
40|$|Rather than ‘more work’, David Spencer {{argues that}} the pursuit of less work could provide a route to a better {{standard}} of life, including {{a better quality of}} work life. Reducing work time can <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> realising the intrinsic rewards of work as reducing its burdensome qualities. It would also allow work to be shared more evenly across the available population, overcoming the anomaly of overwork for some and unemployment for others...|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "Find Your Way" [...] motto has {{a host of}} {{different}} interpretations and applications. For Mahrt, the league <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the managers and coaches as the players themselves. [...] The common denominator is the pursuit of future employment; the players can obtain it while participating in the league, the managers can obtain it by participating in the league. The LCBL is a resume-building experience for young talent {{in the ranks of}} collegiate assistant coaches.|$|R
5000|$|... "Any flags, Ralph?" [...] - During Kentucky {{football}} games, if a Wildcat player {{scored a}} long touchdown, Ledford would ask long-time broadcast partner and color commentator Ralph Hacker if the referee had thrown a flag. This question <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> genuine {{concern that the}} play would <b>be</b> called back <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> his remembering how many similar plays were negated due to Kentucky penalties in previous games. The humorous question caught on with fans, and is perhaps Ledford's most memorable football saying.|$|R
6000|$|What {{the world}} at large really needs, and will one day get, is not this, but due {{recognition}} of the true value of science in education. We don't all want to be made into first-class anatomists like Owen, still less into first-class practical surgeons, like Sir Henry Thompson. But what we do all want is a competent general knowledge (amongst other things) of anatomy at large, and especially of human anatomy; of physiology at large, and especially of human physiology. We don't all want to be analytical chemists: but what we do all want is to know as much about oxygen and carbon as will enable us to understand the commonest phenomena of combustion, of chemical combination, of animal or vegetable life. We don't all want to be zoologists, and botanists of the type who put their names after [...] "critical species:" [...] but what we do all want to know <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> plants and animals as will enable us to walk through life intelligently, and to understand the meaning of the things that surround us. We want, in one word, a general acquaintance with the results rather than with the methods of science.|$|E

Yes, it is about a quest to conquer the world’s highest peak, and yes, the cinematography is breathtaking. But 'Journey to Everest' is more…much more.

25|$|Archery is a {{traditional}} sport in Ladakh, and many villages hold archery festivals, which <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> traditional dancing, drinking and gambling as about the sport.
