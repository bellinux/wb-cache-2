5|$|In 1969 {{the large}} Allied Breweries combine {{initiated}} a {{hostile takeover bid}} for Boddingtons, which valued the company at Â£5million. Charles Boddington took {{the unusual step of}} issuing a spirited defence of the company to the shareholders: You will be only too aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, at this moment in time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> the national economy, add nothing to the nation's exports, and contribute nothing at all to the quality of life that we are all used to enjoy.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} hit by a {{marksman}} from the Redoutable, firing at a range of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on the handling of the tiller. He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You can <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E

I have agonised because {{of the limitations of}} power. Power and the helplessness surrounding it are a peculiar tragedy, in fact.|$|E

Astronauts use bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill. Astronauts subject to long periods of weightlessness wear pants with elastic bands attached between waistband and cuffs to compress the leg bones and reduce osteopenia.|$|E
25|$|The steam {{turbines}} were plagued with problems {{from the time}} the ship first entered service and, despite being technically advanced and fuel-efficient in 1968, her consumption of 600 tons of fuel oil every twenty four hours was more than expected for such a ship by the 1980s. After seventeen years of service the availability of spare parts was becoming difficult due to the outdated design of the boilers and turbines, and Cunard decided that the options were to either <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> the remainder of the ship's life, re-configure the existing engines, or re-engine the vessel with a more efficient diesel-electric powerplant. Ultimately it was decided to replace the engines, as it was calculated that the savings in fuel costs and maintenance would pay for themselves over four years, and give the vessel a minimum of another twenty years of service, whereas the other options would only provide short-term relief. Her {{steam turbines}} had taken her to a record breaking total of 2,622,858 miles in 18 years.|$|E
500|$|Other famed Shiva-related texts {{influenced}} Hatha Yoga, integrated monistic (Advaita Vedanta) {{ideas with}} Yoga philosophy and inspired the theoretical development of Indian classical dance. These include the Shiva Sutras, the Shiva Samhita, and those by the scholars of Kashmir Shaivism {{such as the}} 10th-century scholar Abhinavagupta. Abhinavagupta writes in his notes on the relevance of ideas related to Shiva and Yoga, by stating that [...] "people, occupied as they are with their own affairs, normally <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> others", and Shiva and Yoga spirituality helps one look beyond, understand interconnectedness, and thus benefit both {{the individual and the}} world towards a more blissful state of existence.|$|E

500|$|The third single [...] "911 Is a Joke" [...] {{features}} Flavor Flav as {{the lead}} MC. He was given the idea by Chuck D to write the song. As Flav recalled, [...] "I went and got high and wrote the record. I went and got ripped, I went {{and got out of}} my mind, and I started speaking all kinds of crazy shit 'cos usually {{back in the days when}} I used to smoke, it used to broaden my ideas and everything". The humorous and satirical subject matter is reflected in its music video, which featured a severely injured Flav being mistreated by a remiss, overdue ambulance staff. Another Flavor Flav-solo track, the fifth single [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man", has lyrics advocating African-American self-reliance and denouncing welfare dependence. It also reflects on Flav's experiences with acquaintances from poor neighborhoods. He said of his inspiration for the song, [...] "I was in my Corvette riding from Long Island going to The Bronx. I was slipping. I was roasting. I mean I was smoked-out crazy. And everybody kept asking me for stuff and yet nobody wanted to give me stuff. So then if anybody ever asked me for something I would be like, 'Yo, I can't <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> ya man.' Next thing you know I started to vibe on it: 'I can't <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> ya man,' um ahh um um ahh. So I went and told that to Chuck. Chuck was like, 'Record that shit man'". Writing of both tracks, music critic Tom Moon comments that Flav [...] "affects a tone of gimme-a-break sarcasm that is crucial to both tracks, and is welcome respite from Chuck D.'s assault". [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man" [...] was featured in the 1990 comedy film House Party.|$|E
500|$|The {{electoral votes}} of closely contested New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would {{determine}} the election. In New York, the Tammany Democrats {{decided that they}} would gain more from supporting a Democrat they disliked than a Republican who would <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> them. Blaine hoped {{that he would have}} more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine's mother was Irish Catholic, and he had been supportive of the Irish National Land League while he was Secretary of State. The Irish, a significant group in three of the swing states, did appear inclined to support Blaine until a Republican, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech pivotal for the Democrats, denouncing them as the party of [...] "Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion." [...] The Democrats spread the word of this implied Catholic insult {{on the eve of the}} election. They also blistered Blaine for attending a banquet with some of New York City's wealthiest men.|$|E

And while we're at it, stop wearing that tinny 'F' round your neck, for flip's sake. You're not a gangster rapper, and anyway your real name's Arthur." [...] Emery also said the storyline where Fatboy asks Mercy to marry him so she {{can stay in the}} country sounded [...] "somewhat familiar", as Coronation Street was featuring a similar storyline at the same time. Amy Duncan from the Metro said Fatboy was one of her favourite young characters in EastEnders and said that, with Poppy, he [...] "bring some much-needed light into the soap". Vicky Prior from the Metro said that Fatboy [...] "is easily one of the best characters in EastEnders, able to interact seamlessly with other characters, both young and old." ...|$|E

He kept me under contract, paid me to <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> close on two years." [...] Hitchcock sold her contract to Universal Studios, which dismissed her when she refused to work on one of its television shows. However, her acting career continued and she appeared in a number of film and television productions. Hedren said that while she was still under contract to Hitchcock, he turned down several film roles on her behalf, and was particularly disappointed when she heard from French director FranÃ§ois Truffaut that he had wanted her for his film Fahrenheit 451. Truffaut's daughter Laura disputed this, telling Tony Lee Moral her mother had expressed surprise at the mention of Hedren's possible involvement in the project. Laura Truffaut was also sceptical of the story. [...] "It is extremely unlikely in my view that my father seriously entertained this project without sharing it with my mother as he was not secretive about the other actors who were considered for casting." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{far as the}} {{evidence}} goes, Ryan did not change his political views after his release from the Spanish prison; Francis Stuart and the Clissmanns agreed on that. [...] According to the Clissmanns he remained [...] "an Irish Republican and a Connolly Socialist" [...] all his life. However he was frustrated because he could <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> Ireland. [...] After the Summer of 1941 he was concerned with defending Ireland's neutrality and he sided with De Valera on that point. There was also the shortage of arms in Ireland to defend itself â Churchill had prevented any supplies of arms to the Republic because Ireland would not give up the ports, and the Americans would not contravene the embargo. [...] Churchill had also hinted at an invasion of the south of Ireland should it be required â {{there was a lot}} for all concerned to ponder about in those troubled times.|$|E
2500|$|Instructions (statements) in {{assembly}} language are generally very simple, unlike those in high-level languages. Generally, a mnemonic is a symbolic {{name for a}} single executable machine language instruction (an opcode), and {{there is at least}} one opcode mnemonic defined for each machine language instruction. Each instruction typically consists of an operation or opcode plus zero or more operands. Most instructions refer to a single value, or a pair of values. [...] Operands can be immediate (value coded in the instruction itself), registers specified in the instruction or implied, or the addresses of data located elsewhere in storage. This is determined by the underlying processor architecture: the assembler merely reflects how this architecture works. Extended mnemonics are often used to specify a combination of an opcode with a specific operand, e.g., the System/360 assemblers use [...] as an extended mnemonic for [...] with a mask of 15 and [...] ("NO OPeration" [...] â <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> one step) for [...] with a mask of 0.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1943 {{after the}} Armistice, Italian {{officers}} and soldiers {{that in many}} places waited for clear superior orders, were arrested by Germans and Italian fascists and taken to German internment camps in Germany or Eastern Europe, where they were held {{for the duration of}} World War II. The International Red Cross could <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> them, as they were not regarded as POWs, but the prisoners held the status of [...] "military internees". Treatment of the prisoners was generally poor. The author Giovannino Guareschi was among those interned and wrote about this time in his life. The book was translated and published as [...] "My Secret Diary". He wrote about the hungers of semi-starvation, the casual murder of individual prisoners by guards and how, when they were released (now from a German camp), they found a deserted German town filled with foodstuffs that they (with other released prisoners) ate.. It is estimated that of the 1,070,000 Italians taken prisoner by the Germans, around 40,000 died in detention and more than 13,000 lost their lives during the transportation from the Greek islands to the mainland.|$|E

With characteristic humor, Diogenes dismissed his ill fortune by saying, [...] "If Manes can live without Diogenes, why not Diogenes without Manes?" [...] Diogenes would mock such a relation of extreme dependency. He found {{the figure of}} a master who could <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> himself contemptibly helpless. He was attracted by the ascetic teaching of Antisthenes, a student of Socrates. When Diogenes asked Antisthenes to mentor him, Antisthenes ignored him and reportedly [...] "eventually beat him off with his staff". Diogenes responds, [...] "Strike, for you will find no wood hard enough to keep me away from you, so long as I think you've something to say." [...] Diogenes became Antisthenes' pupil, despite the brutality with which he was initially received. [...] Whether the two ever really met is still uncertain, but he surpassed his master in both reputation and the austerity of his life. He considered his avoidance of earthly pleasures a contrast to and commentary on contemporary Athenian behaviors. This attitude was grounded in a disdain for what he regarded as the folly, pretense, vanity, self-deception, and artificiality of human conduct.|$|E
