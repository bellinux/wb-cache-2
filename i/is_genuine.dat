The scene was originally to have Redfoot flick the cigarette at McManus's chest, but the actor missed and hit Baldwin's face by accident. Baldwin's reaction <b>is</b> <b>genuine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following Thompson's attack {{upon the}} {{veracity}} of the codex, a number of scholars published their opinions that the document <b>is</b> <b>genuine</b> {{over the course of}} the 1980s and early 1990s, including John B. Carlson, Yuri Knorozov, Thomas A. Lee, Jr., Jesús Ignacio Mora Echeverría, George E. Stuart, and Karl Taube. In 2000, German epigrapher Nikolai Grube expressed his belief that the document <b>is</b> <b>genuine,</b> based upon the precision of the Venus almanac. However, in a later publication from 2012, he clearly calls the codex a forgery. In 2002, French archaeologist Claude-François Baudez commented – like Thompson before – that the codex serves no divinatory purpose and was useless as an aid to a Maya priest; he believes that the document is the product of a forger using pre-Columbian materials but relatively ignorant of his subject. The codex is notable in its use of prominent illustrations of uniform size and the almost complete absence of hieroglyphic text; the deities lack names and the cardinal directions are unmarked. In a paper published in 2003, the authors (including Mayanist Stephen D. Houston) argue that the iconography and lack of hieroglyphic text are the result of a strong central Mexican stylistic influence.|$|E
5|$|In her {{arguments}} for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos {{in opposition to}} what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Driven by an Enlightenment belief in progress, she derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family has a farm sufficient for its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she claims <b>is</b> <b>genuine</b> feeling, with Burke's false theatrical tableaux.|$|E
5000|$|How can Islam Akhun and his {{comparatively}} illiterate confederates {{be credited}} with the no mean ingenuity necessary for excogitating scripts? ... To sum up, the conclusion to which, with the present information, I have come, is that the scripts <b>are</b> <b>genuine,</b> and that most, if not all, of the block-prints in the Collection <b>are</b> also <b>genuine</b> antiquities, and that if any are forgeries, they can only be duplicates of others which <b>are</b> <b>genuine.</b>|$|R

5|$|Spall {{auditioned for}} another role, but Ridley Scott {{asked him to}} play Millburn. Trying to {{duplicate}} {{the reaction of the}} Alien cast to the chestburster scene, the director did not tell the Prometheus cast that a Hammerpede puppet was in the silicon replica of Spall's body; Kate Dickie's scream <b>is</b> <b>genuine.</b> The character of Milburn was criticized, since no biologist would touch an unidentified, extraterrestrial organism displaying hostility. Spall defended his character, citing a deleted scene where Millburn holds a smaller, docile Hammerpede.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{addressed}} {{his work}} In regum librum XXX quaestiones to Nothhelm, who {{had asked the}} thirty questions on the biblical book of Kings that Bede answered. Bede's work De VIII Quastionibus may have been written for Nothhelm. While he was archbishop, Boniface wrote to him, requesting {{a copy of the}} Libellus responsionum of Pope Gregory I for use in Boniface's missionary efforts. Boniface also asked for information on when the Gregorian mission to England arrived in England. This text of the Libellus responsionum {{has been the subject of}} some controversy, with the historian Suso Brechter arguing that the text was a forgery created by Nothhelm and a Roman archdeacon. The historian Paul Meyvaert has refuted this view, and most historians incline towards the belief that the text <b>is</b> <b>genuine,</b> although it is not considered conclusively proven.|$|E

A {{verifier}} wishing {{to know that a}} part <b>was</b> <b>genuine</b> would ask the part to sign a cryptographic nonce with its EPID key. The part would sign the nonce and also provide a proof that the EPID key was not revoked. The verifier after checking the validity of the signature and proof would know that the part <b>was</b> <b>genuine.</b> With EPID, this proof is anonymous and unlinkable.|$|R
5|$|In her {{arguments}} for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos {{in opposition to}} what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Influenced by Enlightenment thinkers, she believed in progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She argues for rationality, pointing out that Burke's system {{would lead to the}} continuation of slavery, simply because it had been an ancestral tradition. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a farm that will just suit its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she says <b>is</b> <b>genuine</b> feeling, to Burke's false feeling.|$|E
5|$|Jacqui meets divorcee Tony and an {{attraction}} igniting, they have sex. Tony goes away on holiday and starts {{a relationship with}} Jacqui on his return. Jacqui violates her prison tag after staying at Tony's house overnight so she is sent back to prison. Sadly, Tony is forced to dump her because he cannot handle the pressure. Jacqui befriends Becca Dean (Ali Bastian) but Becca is killed by another prisoner and Jacqui is devastated. Jacqui decides {{to make something of}} herself, not wanting to waste her life and is reunited with Tony and Davey returns with the favour. He forces Jacqui to marry Aleksander Malota (Jon Lolis). Jacqui and Aleksander manage to convince an immigration officer that their romance <b>is</b> <b>genuine</b> and they are married but Jacqui continues her affair with Tony secretly. The family uncover the truth about the marriage when Carmel and Alek's affair is revealed. Jacqui admits she married Alek to pay off her debt to Davey and is seeing Tony. Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) is furious and orders Jacqui, Alek and Carmel to leave the house. Jacqui announces her pregnancy; Tony initially doesn't want the child, fearing that it may die like his previous child and their dreams are shattered when Jacqui miscarries and is left unable to have children of her own. Tony attacks Alek violently as he blames Alek as he cannot grieve for his baby publicly. Tony announces to the people in The Dog that the baby was his, not Alek's and Jacqui asks Alek to return to Albania so she can live her life and he agrees. Carmel is shocked to discover Alek is leaving, leaving Carmel devastated. Depressed, Jacqui returns to her old habit of shop lifting, so Neville Ashworth (Jim Millea) gets her locked up for the night.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, as {{many other}} {{scholars}} have concluded, it is inadvisable to rest too much on Secret Mark. The alleged letter of Clement that quotes {{that it might be}} a forgery from more recent centuries. If the letter <b>is</b> <b>genuine,</b> the Secret Mark to which it refers may be, at most, an ancient but secondary edition of Mark produced in the second century by some group seeking to promote its own esoteric interests.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} {{of much of}} the propaganda relating the Bahá'í Faith to Russian influence is a memoir attributed to Dimitri Ivanovich Dolgorukov who was the Russian ambassador to Persia from 1846 to 1854. The memoir states that Dolgorukov created the Bábí and Bahá'í religions so as to weaken Iran and Shi'a Islam. The memoir was first published in 1943 in Persian in Mashhad, and shortly thereafter published again in Tehran {{with some of the most}} glaring errors corrected. The book still, however, contains so many historical errors that it is inconceivable that it <b>is</b> <b>genuine.</b>|$|E

Parnassus challenges Tony to choose which pipe <b>is</b> <b>genuine.</b> He chooses wrongly, inserts the copy in his windpipe, and is hanged. Mr. Nick keeps his word and Valentina is freed, but Parnassus is not told where she is, and is abandoned to wander in the Imaginarium.|$|E
25|$|Both {{repetitions of}} the 4th version {{are no longer}} in their {{original}} state. In the Amsterdam version a strip of wood was added at the top—probably by van Gogh himself. The Tokyo version, however, was enlarged on all sides with strips of canvas, which were added at a later time—presumably by the first owner, Émile Schuffenecker. The series is perhaps van Gogh's best known and most widely reproduced. In the 2000s debate arose regarding the authenticity of one of the paintings, and {{it has been suggested that}} this version may have been the work of Émile Schuffenecker or of Paul Gauguin. Most experts, however, conclude that the work <b>is</b> <b>genuine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Activists {{have accused}} {{some of the}} anti-balloon drop protesters of being paid counter-protesters {{supported}} and organized by the North Korean state.

Some counter-protesters object to provoking a nuclear state, and believe that a dialogue with North Korean leadership is needed for the reunification of the Korean peninsula. As some defectors dress in military-style uniforms and sunglasses, {{this has been a}} point for objections. Additionally, there is an estimated three to five percent support for the far-left and the Kim regime in South Korea.|$|E

25|$|The {{revelation of}} the letter caused a {{sensation}} at the time, but was soon met with accusations of forgery and misrepresentation. Subsequent study, including handwriting analysis of higher quality color photographs of the document, first published in 2000, revealed more possible evidence of forgery, and led scholars such as Craig A. Evans and Emanuel Tov to conclude the work is a hoax, with Smith being the most likely perpetrator. However, while {{an increasing number of}} scholars have been convinced by this view, many still maintain that the Mar Saba letter itself <b>is</b> <b>genuine,</b> and debate continues about the authenticity of the letter and the Secret Gospel it describes.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} Greek text is legible {{on the whole}} (see {{transcription}} on the right), much of it remains incomprehensible due to grammatical and syntactical peculiarities, such as they were frequent in magical amulets, and some letter sequences cannot be made any sense of. Nonetheless, one can infer from the intelligible parts that the god Phoebus Apollo is being invoked {{in order to raise}} his arms against someone or something, probably to the advantage of the amulet owner. The wording does not correspond to any other ancient epigraphic and literary texts, providing further evidence that the gold foil <b>is</b> <b>genuine</b> and not a modern forgery.|$|E
25|$|In contradiction Firkovich's most {{sympathetic}} critic, Chwolson, gives as a résumé of his belief, after {{considering all}} controversies, that Firkovich succeeded in demonstrating {{that some of}} the Jewish tombstones from Chufut-Kale date back to the seventh century, and that seemingly modern forms of eulogy and the method of counting after the era of creation were in vogue among Jews much earlier than had been hitherto suspected. Chwolson alone defended him, but he also was forced to admit that in some cases Firkovich had resorted to forgery. In his Corpus Inscriptiorum Hebraicarum (St. Petersburg, 1882; Russian ed., ib. 1884) Chwolson attempts to prove that the Firkovich collection, especially the epitaphs from tombstones, contains much which <b>is</b> <b>genuine.</b>|$|E
