50|$|MERV 14 {{filters are}} capable of {{reducing}} smoke particles by approximately 80% when operating at the filter's design velocity, so a CADR smoke rating on a simple <b>filtering</b> <b>unit</b> that uses a MERV 14 filter will be approximately 0.80 times the fan flow rate in CFM. If the <b>filtering</b> <b>unit</b> does not mix the test room's air very well, it may receive a lower CADR measurement {{because it does not}} operate as efficiently as it should. If a <b>filtering</b> <b>unit</b> uses a MERV 12 filter that removes roughly 40% of the smoke particles, then it may still obtain a smoke CADR of 80 by filtering 200 cubic feet per minute instead of 100 CFM. Conversely, a 99.97% HEPA filter (MERV 17) that removes over 99.9% of the smoke particles needs to filter 80 cubic feet per minute to get a CADR of 80. This shows the CFM airflow of a unit is always equal to or greater than the CADR rating.|$|E

50|$|The type of filter {{incorporated}} into a PAPR must be appropriate to the contaminants {{that need to be}} removed. Some respirators are designed to remove fine particulate matter such as the dust created during various woodworking processes. When used with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, airborne particles containing pathogens (viruses, bacteria) smaller than 5 microns will be removed. (PAPRs are typically required for lab workers in BSL-3 facilities, and sometimes in BSL-2 as well.) When used in combination with the correct filters, PAPRs are suitable for working with volatile organic compounds such as those used in many spray paints. At the same time filters that are suitable for volatile substances must typically have their filter elements replaced more often than a particulate filter. In addition there is some confusion over terminology. Some literature and users will refer to a particulate <b>filtering</b> <b>unit</b> as a dust mask or filter and then use the term respirator to mean a unit that can handle organic solvents.|$|E

The lighting unit is hardware implemented and {{integrated into the}} chip for the low-power acceleration of the 3 D graphics applications.

I) We find bilinear MIPMAP is the best texture filtering algorithm for handheld systems based on our developed energy-efficiency metric. With this observation, we adopt bilinear MIPMAP for our texture <b>filtering</b> <b>unit,</b> which requires only 50 % of texture memory bandwidth compared with trilinear MIPMAP filtering, II) We put the depth test operation into the earlier stage of the graphics pipeline, which eliminates texture memory accesses for invisible pixels, III) We develop a power-efficient small cache system as the interface to rendering memory.
