2500|$|The {{two most}} {{prominent}} theories on lexical access for bilinguals, Language Selective Access and Language Non-Selective Access, {{attempt to explain}} the process and stages of lexical activation and selection. These hypotheses focus on determining whether lexical candidates from different languages that share similar lexical features are activated when a word is presented. For instance, when the Dutch word vork is activated, is the English word pork also activated? <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> [...] "no", it might suggest that language selection happens before the recognition of a word and only the lexical information of the target language is selectively activated, in which case lexical access is language selective. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> [...] "yes", it might suggest the other possibility that the recognition of a word is processed in parallel for both languages and the lexical information of both languages are activated, in which case lexical access is language non-selective. Research pertaining to lexical access has indicated {{that it is not}} achievable to completely suppress a known language.|$|E
2500|$|When people {{converse}} with one another, {{according to the}} American philosopher John Searle, they're making moves, not {{in the real world}} which other species inhabit, but in a shared virtual realm peculiar to ourselves. Unlike the deployment of muscular effort to move a physical object, the deployment of illocutionary force requires no physical effort (except movement of the tongue/mouth to produce speech) and produces no effect which any measuring device could detect. Instead, our action takes place on a quite different level— that of social reality. This kind of reality is in one sense hallucinatory, being a product of collective intentionality. It consists, not of [...] "brute facts"— facts which exist anyway, irrespective of anyone's belief— but of [...] "institutional facts", which [...] "exist" [...] only if you believe in them. Government, marriage, citizenship and money are examples of [...] "institutional facts". One can distinguish between [...] "brute" [...] facts and [...] "institutional" [...] ones by applying a simple test. Suppose no one believed in the fact— would it still be true? <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> [...] "yes", it's [...] "brute". <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> [...] "no", it's [...] "institutional".|$|E

Later, the host leads one person to hide somewhere in the town. The other two must find their fellow player based on how they believe their teammate answered three questions taken from the survey. Selecting which route to take usually follows this premise: If Player X answered the question with Player Y, go left; otherwise, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> believed to be Player Z, go right.

2500|$|The Face Advantage allows {{information}} and memories to be recalled easier through {{the presentation of}} a person's face rather than a person's voice. Faces and voices are very similar stimuli that reveal similar {{information and}} result in similar processes of memory recall. During face perception, there are three stages of memory recall that include recognition, followed by the remembering of semantic memory and episodic memory, and finally name recall. The Face Advantage is shown through an experiment where participants are presented with faces and voices of unfamiliar faces and recognizable celebrity faces. [...] The stimuli are presented with a between-group design. The participants are asked to say if the face or voice is familiar. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> yes, {{they are asked to}} recall semantic and episodic memories and finally the name of the face or voice. It was much easier for those presented with a celebrity's face to recall information than for those presented with a voice. The results show that in the second stage of face perception when memories are recalled, information is recalled faster and more accurate after a face is perceived, and slower, less accurate and with less detail after a voice is perceived. [...] A possible explanation is that the connections between face representations and semantic and episodic memory are stronger than that of voices.|$|E

The four clue givers sat in a line so as to form three clue-giving pairs. Each pair received a word to describe and constructed a clue question by building it alternately one word at a time.
