40|$|Changes in {{temperature}} and moisture resulting from climate change {{are likely to}} strongly modify the ecosystem carbon sequestration capacity in high-latitude areas, both through vegetation shifts and via direct warming effects on photosynthesis and decomposition. This paper offers a synthesis of research addressing the potential impacts of climate warming on soil processes and carbon fluxes at the forest–tundra ecotone in Scandinavia. Our results demonstrated higher rates of organic matter decomposition in mountain birch forest than in tundra <b>heath</b> <b>soils,</b> with markedly shallower organic matter horizons in the forest. Field and laboratory experiments suggest that increased temperatures are likely to increase CO 2 efflux from both tundra and forest soil providing moisture availability does not become limiting for the decomposition process. Furthermore, colonization of tundra heath by mountain birch forest would increase rates of decomposition, and thus CO 2 emissions, from the tundra <b>heath</b> <b>soils,</b> which currently store substantial amounts of potentially labile carbon. Mesic soils underlying both forest and tundra heath are currently weak sinks of atmospheric methane, but {{the strength of this}} sink could be increased with climate warming and/or drying...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus (P) is an {{important}} macronutrient in arctic and subarctic tundra and its bioavailability is regulated by the mineralization of organic P. Temperature {{is likely to be}} {{an important}} control on P bioavailability, although effects may differ across contrasting plant communities with different soil properties. We used an elevational gradient in northern Sweden that included both heath and meadow vegetation types at all elevations to study the effects of temperature, soil P sorption capacity and oxalate-extractable aluminium (Alox) and iron (Feox) on the concentration of different soil P fractions. We hypothesized that the concentration of labile P fractions would decrease with increasing elevation (and thus declining temperature), but would be lower in meadow than in heath, given that N to P ratios in meadow foliage are higher. As expected, labile P in the form of Resin-P declined sharply with elevation for both vegetation types. Meadow soils did not have lower concentrations of Resin-P than <b>heath</b> <b>soils,</b> but they did have 2 -fold and 1. 5 -fold higher concentrations of NaOH-extractable organic P and Residual P, respectively. Further, meadow soils had 3 -fold higher concentrations of Alox + Feox and a 20 % higher P sorption index than did <b>heath</b> <b>soils.</b> Additionally, Resin-P expressed as a proportion of total soil P for the meadow was on average half that in the heath. Declining Resin-P concentrations with elevation were best explained by an associated 2. 5 - 3. 0 °C decline in temperature. In contrast, the lower P availability in meadow relative to <b>heath</b> <b>soils</b> may be associated with impaired organic P mineralization, as indicated by a higher accumulation of organic P and P sorption capacity. Our results indicate that predicted temperature increases in the arctic over the next century may influence P availability and biogeochemistry, with consequences for key ecosystem processes limited by P, such as primary productivity...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} growing recent use of {{elevational}} gradients as tools for assessing effects of temperature changes on vegetation properties, because these gradients enable temperature effects to be considered over larger spatial and temporal scales than is possible through conventional experiments. While many studies have explored the direct effects of temperature, the indirect effects of temperature through its long-term influence on soil abiotic or biotic properties remain essentially unexplored. We performed two climate chamber experiments using soils from a subarctic elevational gradient in Abisko, Sweden to investigate the direct effects of temperature, and indirect effects of temperature via soil legacies, on growth of two grass species. The soils were collected from each of two vegetation types (heath, dominated by dwarf shrubs, and meadow, dominated by graminoids and herbs) at each of three elevations. We found that plants responded to both the direct effect of temperature and its indirect effect via soil legacies, and that direct and indirect effects were largely decoupled. Vegetation type was {{a major determinant of}} plant responses to both the direct and indirect effects of temperature; responses to soils from increasing elevation were stronger and showed a more linear decline for meadow than for <b>heath</b> <b>soils.</b> The influence of soil biota on plant growth was independent of elevation, with a positive influence across all elevations regardless of soil origin for meadow soils but not for <b>heath</b> <b>soils.</b> Taken together, this means that responses of plant growth to soil legacy effects of temperature across the elevational gradient were driven primarily by soil abiotic, and not biotic, factors. These findings emphasize that vegetation type is a strong determinant of how temperature variation across elevational gradients impacts on plant growth, and highlight the need for considering both direct and indirect effects of temperature on plant responses to future climate change...|$|R

50|$|Over 80% of the heathlands {{that once}} covered {{extensive}} areas of southern Britain have been lost, with similar losses {{on the near}} continent where the remaining lowland heathland of oceanic temperate regions occurs. This dramatic decline began during the eighteenth century and early nineteenth century as changes in agriculture, {{which resulted in the}} loss of grazing on heaths, and as the growing availability of cheap coal as an alternative to other fuels, brought traditional heathland management to an end in many areas. Large areas of heathland were lost to neglect or subjected to agricultural “improvement” and enclosure as arable farming methods advanced.

50|$|Sinclair also {{corresponded with}} Sir James Edward Smith, {{founder of the}} Linnean Society, about various plants. By 1823 he was a Fellow of the Horticultural Society where he read a paper on the Woburn {{perennial}} kale. On 26 March 1824 he became {{a fellow of the}} Linnean Society, having been elected by Joseph Sabine and the Duke of Bedford. In 1822 the Duke of Bedford had begun a comprehensive collection of exotic and indigenous heaths as a way of recuperating from a very severe illness. In his Introduction to Hortus ericaeus Woburnensis which was published in February 1825 the Duke states that the collection was completed under the superintendence of his former gardener, George Sinclair. In Hortus Woburnensis, written later by Sinclair's successor James Forbes, the design of the heath parterres at Woburn is also attributed to Sinclair, and {{in a letter to the}} Duke, Sir George Hayter, who did the illustrations for Hortus ericaeus, made reference to Sinclair as having shown him around the greenhouse and parterres and selecting the specimens to be illustrated. To find the best possible growing conditions for the collection of heaths Sinclair began collecting different types of heath soils and analysing their constituents. After several years of systematic investigation he concluded that they were made up mainly of humus, which derived from decayed leaves, and sand. He also collected calcareous soils from around Luton and Dunstable and experimented in mixing them with various proportions of peat and ashes to try to find a potting medium suitable for the more exotic specimens of heaths. However, this proved unsuccessful, and in Hortus ericaeus … he recommended a natural <b>heath</b> <b>soil</b> for the growing of different species. By now Sinclair's brother, John, was working at Loddiges of Hackney where experimental work was being carried out in growing exotic species and in hybridisation. Sinclair purchased some of the Erica in the Woburn collection from here as well as personally collecting specimens from nurseries at Tooting (possibly William Rollison's Springfield Nursery), New Cross, Fulham, Woking, from George Whitworth of Acre House at Claxby by Normanby in Lincolnshire, and the Vineyard Nursery at Hammersmith, owned by James Lee and Lewis Kennedy. He also travelled to Southampton, where he bought hardy heaths from William Bridgewater Page, and to Bristol, where he made purchases of Cape Heaths from John Miller.|$|E

40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungi (AMF) {{can enhance}} plant nutrition and growth. However, {{their contribution to}} nutrient cycling in ecosystems is still poorly understood. Using experimental grassland microcosms filled with two different soil types (pasture and <b>heath</b> <b>soil)</b> and fertilized with different N forms (NO 3 - or NH 4 +), we tested the AMF contribution to N and P cycling including measurements of organic and inorganic leaching losses and N 2 O fluxes. We hypothesized that AMF enhance the sustainability of plant-soil systems by reducing nutrient losses and enhancing plant nutrient uptake. AMF reduced reactive and unreactive P leaching by 31 %, enhanced plant P contents by 15 % and increased P mobilization from soil by 18 %. AMF reduced N 2 O fluxes and NH 4 + leaching in both soils. Leaching of dissolved organic N was reduced by 24 % in the <b>heath</b> <b>soil</b> only.

40|$|Global {{warming in}} the Arctic may alter {{decomposition}} rates in Arctic soils and therefore nutrient availability. In addition, {{changes in the}} length of the growing season may increase plant productivity and the rate of labile C input below ground. We carried out an experiment in which inorganic nutrients (NH 4 NO 3 and NaPO 4) and organic substrates (glucose and glycine) were added to soils sampled from across the mountain birch forest-tundra heath ecotone in northern Sweden (organic and mineral soils from the forest. and organic soil only from the heath). Carbon dioxide production was then monitored continuously over the following 19 days. Neither inorganic N nor P additions substantially affected soil respiration rates when added separately. However, combined N and P additions stimulated microbial activity, with the response being greatest in the birch forest mineral soil (57 % increase in CO 2 production compared with 26 % in the <b>heath</b> <b>soil</b> and 8 % in the birch forest organic soil). Therefore, mineralisation rates in these soils may be stimulated if the overall nutrient availability to microbes increases in response to global change, but N deposition alone is unlikely to enhance decomposition. Adding either, or both, glucose and glycine increased microbial respiration. Isotopic separation indicated that the mineralisation of native soil organic matter (SOM) was stimulated by glucose addition in the <b>heath</b> <b>soil</b> and the forest mineral soil, but not in the forest organic soil. These positive 'priming' effects were lost following N addition in forest mineral soil, and following both N and P additions in the <b>heath</b> <b>soil.</b> In order to meet enhanced microbial nutrient demand, increased inputs of labile C from plants could stimulate the mineralisation of SOM, with the soil C stocks in the tundra-heath potentially most vulnerable...|$|E

We examined this functional interaction by measuring the diversity, vertical structure and productivity of vegetation in shearwater colonies on Rottnest Island, Western Australia, and by comparing these with those in the adjacent, non-colonised heath. The colony supported a distinct, less diverse vegetation community and was dominated by short-lived, succulent exotics. An ecotone was present between the two communities. Across all species, vegetation was shorter and denser in the colony and individual species that co-occurred in both locations were stunted in the colony. The percentage of bare soil in the colony was double that of the heath. The productivity of a phytometer (Rhagodia baccata) was significantly higher in colony soil than in <b>heath</b> <b>soil.</b> In a glasshouse experiment, cuttings grown in colony soil had 337 % of the root mass and 537 % of the foliage mass of plants grown in <b>heath</b> <b>soil.</b> Field measurements demonstrated increased leaf set and foliage extension in colony plants. Seed germination from the colony soil (2674 seedlings m - 2) greatly exceeded that of the heath (59 seedlings m - 2). Dense, productive and species-poor colony vegetation supports the assemblage-level thinning hypothesis as the mechanism for vegetation change, but we argue that prominent colony species are simply better adapted to high nutrient loads and frequent disturbance.

40|$|The {{dependence}} of plants on vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhiza for growth {{is influenced by}} factors {{in addition to the}} compatibility of the symbiont. Important among these are edaphic factors. This thesis describes the effect of VA mycorrhiza on the early growth of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) De Wit in soils containing different levels of phosphorus. The objective of the first experiment was to estimate the number of infective propagules of the most common VA mycorrhizal fungi in natural and cultivated soils in the Melbourne region using the most probable number (MPN) and wet sieving methods. The natural soils collected from disturbed and undisturbed Cranbourne <b>heath</b> <b>soils</b> contained 49 spores and 8 spores per 100 g air dried of soil respectively. These were considerably fewer than spores obtained from agricultural soils which yielded 174 spores per 100 g air dried of soil. Under glasshouse condition there was considerable variation in the infectivity of the indigenous VA mycorrhizal fungi present in the soils. Infection of leucaena seedlings grown in the Cranbourne <b>heath</b> <b>soils</b> developed in 9 - 11 % of the root system by 6 weeks after inoculation. This represented a lower proportion of mycorrhizal roots than developed in the same plants grown in agricultural soil (22 %). Similarly it represented a much lower infection rate than that occurred in subterranean clover in all soils tested (30 - 78 %). The effect of VA mycorrhizal fungi on the growth of leucaena seedling in soils containing different levels of phosphorus was established in a pot experiment. Inoculation increased the seedling growth significantly when no or only low levels of phosphate (20 - 60 mg phosphate/pot) were applied. This growth stimulation was reflected in the increased of apical growth (37 - 100 %), shoot dry matter (222 - 234 %), root dry weight (113 - 139 %) and phosphorus uptake (250 - 370 %) of infected seedlings relative to the controls. Glomus fasciculatum showed its superiority in stimulating leucaena seedling growth relative over the other VA mycorrhizal fungi tested. In pot cultures used for producing inoculum, it was obvious that Glomus fasciculatum was the most rapid infecting and best universal symbiont, as it infected all replicates of each host much faster than the other fungi tested. It is evident from the study that the selection of and inoculation of leucaena with an effective VA mycorrhizal fungus provides substantial benefit when preparing plants for growth in low phosphorus forestry situations.

40|$|In tundra, {{phosphorus}} (P) is {{an important}} macronutrient for plants and microorganisms. A major fraction of P exists as organic compounds in the topsoil which can be mineralized to bioavailable inorganic P. Since mineralization is positively related to temperature, climate warming {{is likely to increase}} P bioavailability but the extend of these changes may also depend on vegetation cover and soil properties. I assessed organic and inorganic P concentrations across an elevation and vegetation gradient in northern Sweden using one dimensional (1 D) solution 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. I hypothesized that concentration of labile soil P will decrease with increasing elevation (decreasing temperature) and that soils with meadow vegetation will contain higher concentrations of labile P than <b>heath</b> <b>soils.</b> Concentration of labile P in the form of Resin-P and polyphosphates decreased with elevation whereas less labile orthophosphate monoesters increased. Across vegetation types, polyphosphates were more abundant in heath and meadow contained higher concentrations of monoesters. The inverse response of Resin-P and monoesters to elevation may be best explained by lowered organic P mineralization in colder climate. High concentrations of polyphosphates at the lowest elevation may indicate an increased presence of fungal communities associated with mountain birch forest. Heath seemed to be more dominated by fungal communities than meadow and higher concentration of monoesters in meadow indicated a higher soil sorption capacity. In a broader view, the results may suggest that a warmer climate increases mineralization of organic P in form of orthophosphate monoesters to more labile P forms. This effect might be enhanced by an upward movement of the tree line and might be more pronounced in <b>heath</b> than meadow <b>soils</b> due to a higher fungal activity...|$|R
40|$|Biogenic {{volatile}} organic compounds (BVOCs) affect both atmospheric processes and ecological interactions. Our primary aim was to differentiate between BVOC emissions from above- and belowground plant parts and <b>heath</b> <b>soil</b> outside the growing season. The second aim was to assess emissions from herbivory, mimicked by cutting the plants. Mesocosms from a temperate Deschampsia flexuosa-dominated heath ecosystem and a subarctic mixed heath ecosystem were either left intact, the aboveground vegetation was cut, or all plant parts (including roots) were removed. For 3 - 5 weeks, BVOC emissions were measured in growth chambers by an enclosure method using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. CO 2 exchange, soil microbial biomass and soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations were also analyzed. Vegetation cutting increased BVOC emissions by more than 20 -fold, and the induced compounds were mainly eight-carbon compounds and sesquiterpenes. In the Deschampsia heath, the overall low BVOC emissions originated mainly from soil. In the mixed heath, root and soil emissions were negligible. Net BVOC emissions from roots and soil of these well-drained heaths do not significantly contribute to ecosystem emissions, at least outside the growing season. If insect outbreaks become more frequent with climate change, ecosystem BVOC emissions will periodically increase due to herbivory...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{determinations}} of soil {{production from}} in situ cosmogenic nuclides indicate that production decreases exponentially with soil depth. This contrasts with a long-held assumption that maximum soil production occurs under a soil cover of finite depth. Sites in the Blue Mountains, Australia, show a sharp decrease of soil depth where vegetation changes from forested plateau surfaces to heath-covered spurs, and bands of bare {{rock in the}} heath suggest that soil production depends on presence of a finite depth of soil. The substrate varies from hard ferruginized sandstone to soft saprolite. In situ 10 Be determinations indicate that apparent rates of erosion and soil production are greater under the relatively thin <b>heath</b> <b>soil</b> than under the thicker forest soil but, in contrast to other studies, these sites do not show significant depth-dependence of apparent soil production. The pattern reflects both hardness variation in the rock substrate {{and the effect of}} Late Quaternary climatic change. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating indicates that soil ≤ 30 cm depth is of Holocene age whereas the deeper soil is substantially older. The age-break coincides with a stone line interpreted as a former surface lag deposit. Assuming that pre-Holocene soil depths were 30 cm less than today, recalculated soil production tends to decrease with increasing depth. Soil production at this site requires soil cover but bare rock patches and vegetation comprise a shifting mosaic.

40|$|Myrmica ruginodis ants and the gorse species U. europaeus have a {{national}} distribution in the U. K. and are considered important keystone species within British lowland heaths. These two species boost and maintain biodiversity by increasing habitat heterogeneity through ecosystem engineering of the soil physical and chemical environment, and are generally considered Keystone species in lowland heaths. Both species {{have been shown to}} increase limiting nutrients in the soil such as Nitrogen and Phosphorus. Here, {{for the first time in}} a single study, the extent to which these species augment soil chemistry and the resulting impacts on microbial communities is quantified. It was hypothesized that abiotic changes brought about by the action of keystone species directly and indirectly will lead to differences in both bacterial and fungal community diversity and composition, and such changes will be likely to modify ecosystem function. Analysis of soil cores taken from three U. K. lowland heath habitats representing {{a national}} distribution found that dissimilarities in microbial community structure (determined by T-RFLP) were largely attributable to differences in soil pH. However, pH was an imperfect predictor. To fully understand abiotic drivers and to identify the soil nutrients involved in augmenting microbial communities in heathlands, a data mining exercise was conducted using the large Countryside Survey 2007 bacterial data. The findings from this showed that as the soil pH gradient was shortened by focusing on low soil pH, and then by looking at a single type of vegetation cover (dwarf shrub <b>heath),</b> <b>soil</b> pH became less effective in explaining differences in the communities; other soil chemical properties then become more important, such as Carbon to Nitrogen (C:N) ratio and soil Phosphorus (P). The identification of these chemical attributes and the known impacts that the keystone species have on them led to the development of a controlled mesocosm experiment using Aberdeenshire lowland <b>heath</b> <b>soil.</b> In this experiment keystone species were isolated and found to impact upon soil chemistry and microbial diversity. Soil pH was identified as having an important defining role on communities, however soil P and C:N and Potassium (K) were also related to microbial community composition. Differences in respiration were also linked to the presence of the keystone species. A final field experiment was performed to test the mesocosm observations in the field site, but sampling specific soil regions (ant nest structures and rhizospheres). Less marked microbial community differentiation was found compared with the initial field experiment. Fungi had no responses to soil chemistry except for Dorset communities which responded to soil pH. Bacteria responded to all soil measures of chemistry for pooled region data and for Aberdeenshire. Cumbria communities responded P and Dorset to C:N. Soil chemistry and microbial communities were not affected by the same keystone species in the same way in any of the regions. Finally, community T-RFLP profiles for fungi and bacteria were directly compared for. any correlation; interaction was found to be limited, partly due to fundamental differences in the bacterial 16 S rDNA and fungal ITS rDNA T-RFLP profiles and partly due to these microbes responding in different ways to their environment.

50|$|For centuries, the {{historical}} basket or heath beehive produced honey and beeswax on the Lüneburg Heath. In the Middle Ages heather honey was a sought-aftern commodity. Beekeeping was {{common in the}} core areas of the former heath, so that almost every farmstead had a Bienenzaun. The farmers employed special beekeeping hands for this purpose. The town of Celle on the Südheide was a major trading centre for heather honey. As early as the 16th century there was a professional apiculture centre. It declined {{during the second half}} of the 19th century for a number of reasons, which led to the retreat of the areas of heathland. As a result of land consolidation there were no areas of common land with their wide range of nectar-producing plants. The introduction of artificial fertiliser enabled better harvest yields from <b>heath</b> <b>soils</b> and so areas of heath were turned into arable land.

40|$|Cereal plants {{growing on}} newly {{reclaimed}} peaty and <b>heath</b> <b>soils</b> often showed serious symptoms of 'reclamation disease' which were cured by adding Cu salts. To elucidate {{the function of}} Cu in this plant disease, several plant species were grown in purified water-culture and sand media practically free from Cu. The symptoms of Cu deficiencies obtained were identical with the symptoms of plants growing in 'diseased' soil. The considerably larger amounts of Cu needed by plants growing in 'diseased' soil proved {{to be due to}} the fixation of Cu by the black organic matter of the soils. Further evidence that a low content of available Cu was the cause of reclamation disease was provided by a microbiological method. In this test the colour of the spores of Aspergillus niger grown in a copper-deficient medium supplied with small amounts of soil was a measure of Cu supply to the fungus. In addition to fixation by certain types of organic matter, bacteria producing hydrogen sulphide may precipitate soluble Cu so that it becomes, at least temporarily, unavailable. With humid air, symptoms of Cu deficiencies were less severe. Copper-deficient wheat plants were more susceptible to fungus diseases. Application of Cu salts may sometimes cause manganese deficiency.
