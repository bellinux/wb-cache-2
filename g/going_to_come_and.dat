One resident told the 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting: [...] "You would go to bed and you would just lie there and you would think, are they <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> kick my door, what's {{going to happen to}} my children?... It was that horrible fear that you lived with day by day, knowing they could come and kick down your door and hold you for hours." [...] The inquiry heard that 9,165 police officers were either deployed on the estate or held in reserve between 10 and 14 October 1985. Thus, argues Rose, the police created, or at least intensified, a climate of fear in which witnesses were afraid to step forward.|$|E

It’s like getting a divorce; even though I’ve never been married other than Flip. I can imagine it’s something like that. There’s parts that you like but there’s parts that {{you just want to}} move on past. It’s really hard to deal with. You wonder, ‘Are you going to lose friends? Are you going to lose business?’ It was a tough decision to make and I’m still spun out about it. I can’t believe that it’s all happening but I think it will be for the better for everyone ... I just couldn’t take it any longer. I couldn’t take the madness and I thought {{it would be better to}} move on than to stay somewhere where I don’t think I necessarily belong anymore.

5000|$|Despite his disappointing run at Sandown, Les Arcs {{was sent}} to Royal Ascot, where he was entered in both the King's Stand Stakes over five furlongs and the Golden Jubilee Stakes over six, being ridden in both races by John Egan. On {{the opening day of}} the meeting he started at odds of 33/1 for the King's Stand, and {{finished}} eleventh of the twenty-eight runners behind the Australian gelding Takeover Target. Les Arcs also started at 33/1 for the Golden Jubilee Stakes four days later, with Takeover Target being made the 7/2 favourite in a field of eighteen. Egan settled the gelding in midfield before making progress in the final quarter mile. He overtook Takover Target approaching the final furlong and held the late challenge of the three-year-old Balthazar's Gift to win the Group One prize by a neck. After the race Egan said [...] "I heard on the commentary there was one (Balthazaar's Gift) coming up and I panicked slightly that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> do me. He's a fantastic horse and was useful over a mile and a quarter. We used to think he was a bit quirky because he never got there but five, six and even seven furlongs seem to suit him a lot better." [...] Pitt praised the winner saying: [...] "This guy put us on the map with a good winter. John gave him a great ride but it was the longest furlong in my life. This guy has got a lot of natural speed but when he kept going up and up the handicap there's only so many places he can be entered up." ...|$|E
5000|$|Throughout the years, {{thinking}} about Charlie Parker, {{there were so}} many marvelous moments and he influenced us in so many different ways. There was a great jam session at Jack's Basket Room after Bird came out of Camarillo State Hospital. He had been quite ill, having problems with drugs and going through other things. It was the night he'd been released. There was an announcement that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> jam. When he arrived, he looked great, really sharp, as healthy as anybody could, and this was his night. I hadn't ever seen him like that before. There must have been thirty or forty different musicians all wanting to show Parker how they could play. All the tenor and alto players were there - Sonny Criss, Wardell Gray, Dexter Gordon, Gene Phillips, Teddy Edwards, Jay McNeely, and on and on. They all played and Bird just sat there and smiled. It was a long night. Finally, Bird got up there and I don't think he played more than three or four choruses. But he told a complete story, caught all the nuances, tapered off to the end. Nobody played a note after that. Everybody just packed up their horns and went on home, because it was so complete, so right..

Deals are often brought to market with one big synergy number and a statement that the deal will be "accretive" to earnings. The problem, however, is that investors can't understand or track one number. Going to market with just one number also suggests that the acquirer has no credible plan, which in turn gives investors more reason to sell shares than to buy, particularly when a significant premium is being offered. 2006 Morgan Stanley. ...|$|R
