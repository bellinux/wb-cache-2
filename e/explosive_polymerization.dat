50|$|Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium, in the {{division}} Firmicutes, named after Joseph Lister. Its ability to grow at temperatures as low as 0 °C permits multiplication at typical refrigeration temperatures, greatly increasing its ability to evade control in human foodstuffs. Motile via flagella at 30 °C and below, but usually not at 37 °C, L. monocytogenes can instead move within eukaryotic cells by <b>explosive</b> <b>polymerization</b> of actin filaments (known as comet tails or actin rockets).|$|E
50|$|Acrylonitrile {{is highly}} {{flammable}} and toxic at low doses. It undergoes <b>explosive</b> <b>polymerization.</b> The burning material releases fumes of hydrogen cyanide and oxides of nitrogen. It {{is classified as}} a Class 2B carcinogen (possibly carcinogenic) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), and workers exposed {{to high levels of}} airborne acrylonitrile are diagnosed more frequently with lung cancer {{than the rest of the}} population. It evaporates quickly at room temperature (20 °C) to reach dangerous concentrations; skin irritation, respiratory irritation, and eye irritation are the immediate effects of this exposure.|$|E
50|$|Many organic {{peroxides}} can initiate <b>explosive</b> <b>polymerization</b> in materials with unsaturated chemical bonds, and specifically triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD) are powerful explosives. TATP is an inexpensive compound and {{is relatively easy}} to make. Whereas most other potent explosives, such as trinitrotoluene (TNT) or RDX (the major component of C4 mixtures), contain nitrogen, which {{is relatively easy to}} trace by sniffing techniques, TATP is nitrogen free and therefore is very difficult to detect by conventional screening methods. For this reason, it is an explosive favored by terrorists. TATP and HMTD were used in several executed or planned terrorist acts of the early 2000s, most notably in the 2001 shoe bomb plot and the 2005 London Underground bombings. Several detection devices have been designed since those events. One, for example, releases a chemical mixture which changes color when interacting with traces of TATP.|$|E

It is also used as an oxidizer in rocket fuel, for example in red fuming nitric acid; it {{was used in the}} Titan rockets, to launch Project Gemini, in the maneuvering thrusters of the Space Shuttle, and in unmanned space probes sent to various planets.|$|R
5000|$|Organic {{peroxides}} can accidentally initiate <b>explosive</b> <b>polymerization</b> {{in materials}} with unsaturated chemical bonds. Most notably, TATP and HMTD are high explosives, and TATP, {{because of its}} high susceptibility to accidental detonation by shock, friction, or sparks, has earned the nickname [...] "Mother of Satan" [...] among certain Islamic militant groups. TATP can accidentally form as by-products in many commonly used reactions. These reactions range from synthesis of MDMA, where TATP is formed via isosafrole oxidation in acetone, to industrial production of phenol, where the second product of the cumene process, acetone, is partially oxidized to peroxide on the second reaction step. Accidental preparation of organic peroxides can occur by mixing ketone solvents (most commonly acetone) with waste materials containing hydrogen peroxide or other oxidizers and leaving the mixture standing for several hours. In addition, many liquid ethers {{in the presence of}} air, light and metals (which act as catalysts) slowly - over a period of months - form highly unstable ether peroxides such as diethyl ether peroxide. Therefore, ethers are often stored over potassium hydroxide, which not only destroys peroxides but also acts as a powerful desiccant.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Structural changes {{inside the}} head of Thyone sperm {{undergoing}} the acrosomal reaction were followed with a high-resolution, differential interference contrast (DIC) video microscope. The beating sperm, adhering by their midpiece to the cover slip of a wedge perfusion chamber, were activated by a calcium ionophore (201 uM A 23187) suspended in sea water containing 50 mM excess CaC 12. Before activation of the sperm, the acrosomal region appears as a 1. 1 -,um diameter sphere, slightly less dense {{than the rest of}} the sperm head. Upon activation, the acrosome pops; the acrosomal region suddenly swells and its refractive index drops. After ^" 1 s, a crescent-shaped periacrosomal cup appears behind the acrosomal vacuole. In the next several seconds, the cup loses more refractive index and expands forward as the acrosomal process extends. The acrosomal vacuole becomes smaller, but without appreciable drop in refractive index. These observations, coupled with the behavior of the extending acrosomal process reported in the companion paper, and in electron microscopy (EM) and early physiological studies, suggest that the acrosomal process is extended by a combination of the <b>explosive</b> <b>polymerization</b> of actin and the osmotic swelling of the periacrosomal cup material...|$|E

In this paper, we also consider the meaning of the enhanced DIC image seen in the high-resolution video microscope, and discuss the reliability of measurements on small linear dimensions made with the DIC microscope...|$|E
40|$|Peroxides are a {{class of}} {{chemical}} compounds with unusual stability problems and {{are one of the}} most hazardous classes of chemicals routinely handled in the laboratory. Peroxides can be formed via intentional chemical reactions (i. e., ozonolysis), but just as hazardous is the inadvertent peroxide formation during storage of certain compounds. Some compounds form explosive peroxides and others are polymerizable unsaturated compounds that can initiate a runaway, <b>explosive</b> <b>polymerization</b> reaction. To varying degrees, shock, heat or friction may cause unexpected explosion of peroxidized organic chemicals. Common classes of compounds that form peroxides include: 1. Ethers, acetals, and ketals, especially cyclic ethers and those with primary and/or secondary alkyl groups 2. Aldehydes, including acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde 3. Compounds containing benzylic hydrogens 4. Compounds containing allylic hydrogens, including most alkenes; vinyl and vinylidene compounds, and dienes Refer to Appendix A for a list of common peroxide forming chemicals and recommendations on safe storage durations. STORAGE AND HANDLING y The quantity of peroxide-forming chemicals kept should be restricted to the minimum amount needed. y Store peroxide-formers in airtight bottles, away from light and heat. Avoid using containers with loose-fitting lids and glass ground stoppers. y Certain peroxide formers, including those in Appendix A-List A, should be stored under nitrogen if possible. y Evaluate for peroxide formation regularly and always prior to distillation (see right). Some materials may need evaluation as often as every 3 months. y Crystallization, discoloration, and stratification are signs a peroxide former may have become shock sensitive – Do not move the container, and call EH&S promptly at 725 - 9999. y If evaporation or distillation is necessary, do not distill to a dry residue. Always leave at least 10 - 20 % residual bottoms. LABELING All peroxide-forming compounds should be labeled as shown below with date received and date opened. For common peroxide formers, guidance on recommended shelf life and time interval for peroxide evaluation i...|$|E
