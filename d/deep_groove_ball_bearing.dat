40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is the development of}} a rolling element bearing with an integrated sensor for on-line health diagnosis. The work was divided into four distinct phases. ^ The first phase of the development was the structural design of the sensor-integrated bearing. The sensor module was embedded in the bearing via a modification of the outer ring. A methodology was developed for designing the outer ring modification by determining how the modification affected the structural integrity of the bearing. Based on the results of several structural analyses, a design template was created. ^ Dynamic modeling was {{the second phase of the}} development. The vibration caused by a defective bearing component was simulated using physical models of the bearing structure. It was found that multiple defects could be grouped into families that produced similar vibration spectra. The effect of a misalignment between the inner and outer rings was also investigated. This type of fault was found to cause predictable load variations on the rolling elements. ^ With the first two phases completed, the third phase of this work was the development of an algorithm for processing the sensor signal. A wavelet-based signal processing algorithm was created to analyze the sensor signal in the time-scale domain This algorithm used a new wavelet which was constructed using an actual impulse response taken from a bearing with two embedded sensor modules. The signal decomposition based on this new wavelet was found to provide a better picture of important diagnostic information contained in the sensor signal. In addition to the wavelet analysis, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system was used to characterize the sensor signal in terms of fault signatures. ^ The fourth phase of this work was to experimentally verify the results obtained in the first three phases. <b>Deep</b> <b>groove</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> were used for the experiments, and the tests were conducted at many different loads, speeds, and combinations thereof. Predicted load variations and vibration spectra were observed in the experimental data, which validated the results obtained in the first three investigative phases of this work. ^ The dynamics and kinematics of rolling element bearings were studied, and a time-scale signal processing algorithm was developed in this work.

40|$|Lubricants are {{subjected}} to high pressures in many mechanical devices - notably gears, cams, piston rings and rolling element bearings. The contact pressure between the ball and the race in a <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> can {{be as high as}} 5 GPa. At such high pressures, it is necessary to be able to measure the rheological behaviour of the lubricant in order to obtain input data for computer simulations of rolling and sliding contacts. Lubricant manufacturers are often unable to provide information about the rheology of the lubricant at high pressures, temperatures, shear stresses and shear rates. In paper A, a new Couette rheometer was developed to measure the rheological properties of fluids at pressures up to 500 MPa. The shearrate range covers 0. 5 to 20000 1 /s and the instrument can operate up to 1 O 0 °C at maximum pressure. The results from the apparatus show excellent agreement with measurements made with a failing ball viscometer on a Newtonian fluid. Criteria for non-laminar flow and viscous heating have been developed for the apparatus to verify that these effects do not significantly influence the measurements. In grease lubricated machine elements the supply of grease to the contact region is very important for long life and maintenance-free operation. For example, in a bearing application the grease is often applied within the housing but outside the bearing. For good lubrication the grease has to move from the storage space into the bearing in order to separate the moving surfaces. One important part of this grease movement is the transport from near the contact region into the rolling track. This transportation mechanism may depend on different phenomena such as: capillary forces, vibrations, drop formation, oil bleeding etc. The papers B-G in this thesis describe investigations of these various phenomena. Papers B-D deal with the drop formation of oils and greases in the outlet of an elastohydrodynamically lubricated contact and how different surface energies can affect the distribution of lubricant between the surfaces. Paper E describes the elongation of grease filaments formed when two surfaces are separating from each other, as a function of time. Measurements of the lift off (adhesion) force acting between the two solid surfaces as a function of time were also made. In paper F a ball and disc apparatus was used to study the replenishment of grease due to side slip. The inlet distance and the 'butterfly' shaped meniscus that surrounds the contact point was studied {{as a function of the}} side slip motion of the ball. The filament formation equations from paper E were extended to include the geometry of the butterfly and the inlet distance. Finally, in paper G, four <b>deep</b> <b>groove</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> were tested in a SKF R 2 F test rig to evaluate how lift-off-speed and breakthrough-speed are affected by ball spin.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{a dynamic}} multibody {{model of a}} <b>deep</b> <b>groove</b> single row <b>ball</b> <b>bearing.</b> The objective {{of the study is}} to simulate the dynamic behavior of a bearing under different operational conditions. Typical vibration signals used in bearing diagnostics are simulated using the non-linear Hertzian contact theory. Geometry, material properties, friction and damping coefficients are considered as input while displacements, velocities, accelerations and forces between bearing rings are calculated and validated with the analytical formulations found in literature. Furthermore localized faults are introduced in the simulation in order to extract bearing defect frequencies and to represent the real vibration signal signature in case of fault components. For this purpose, a simplified model is realized using the polygonal contact model. This approach allows to investigate more in detail the effect of localized defects by reproducing the real rolling elements trajectories through a discretization of the contact surfaces. The low computation efficiency compared to the traditional Hertzian approach limits the application of this contact algorithm on the complete bearing model. Nevertheless, the simplified model allows to draw conclusions regarding the influence of the shaft/cage speed on the fault size estimation giving an innovative contribution on bearing diagnostics. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this investigation}} were to design and construct a high speed turbocharger test rig (TTR) to measure dynamics of differing turbocharger rotor bearing systems {{and to develop a}} coupled rotor-cartridge model for the <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> rotor system to corroborate the experimental and analytical results. The <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> rotor is supported by an angular contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> cartridge. In order to achieve the {{objectives of}} the experimental aspect of this study, a TTR was designed and developed with the capability of reaching speeds in excess of 100, 000 rpm driven by compressed air. The TTR was used to compare and contrast the whirl and friction characteristics of two identical turbochargers differing only by the support structure of the rotor system; one containing a floating ring bearing turbocharger (FRBT) and the other a <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> turbocharger (BBT). A pair of displacement sensors was installed to measure the whirl of the rotor {{near the end of the}} compressor. The BBT was shown to be significantly more rigid and stable as compared to the FRBT with an average reduction in radial rotor motion of 47 %. The motion of the BBT consisted of mainly synchronous motion whereas the FRBT was dominated by subsynchronous motion throughout the entire range of speeds. The TTR was also used to compare frictional losses within the bearings. A study of run-down times after the pressurized air supply was removed indicated that the BBT has significantly lower frictional losses under all operating conditions tested with an average increase in run-down time of 14. 1 %. ^ A wireless telemetry based temperature sensor was designed specifically for the turbocharger <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> system to monitor the internal bearing temperature located on the cage during operation. It was shown to be able to withstand the harsh environments of turbocharger fnapplications operating at high speeds. The sensor accurately monitored transient bearing cage temperature due to changes in operating speed. ^ Custom sensors were developed in order to measure the axial forces acting on the rotor due to aerodynamic effects. The sensors utilized cantilever beams outfitted with strain gages to measure the applied load from the bearing cartridge. Results of dynamic testing indicated the magnitude and direction of the axial force is dependent on the operating conditions of the turbine and compressor. ^ To achieve the objectives of the analytical investigation, the explicit finite element method (EFEM) and the discrete element method (DEM) were coupled to investigate dynamics of flexible rotor systems supported by <b>deep</b> <b>groove</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b> DEM was used to develop the dynamic bearing model (DBM) in which all of the components of the bearing (i. e. races, balls, and cage) have six degrees-of-freedom. The flexible shaft was modeled with a full 3 D elastic formulation using the EFEM. Rotor and inner races of the bearings were fully coupled such that both translation and rotation of the flexible rotor are transmitted to the bearings. The resulting reaction forces and moments calculated in DBM were in turn applied to the nodes of the shaft. The combined rotor-bearing model was used to investigate the motions of the inner races at low speeds and the resulting reaction forces and moments from the supporting bearings due to a large applied load on the shaft. In the current coupled modeling approach, the deformation of the shaft affected the internal components of the bearing by altering the orientation of the inner race which results in ball spin and slip. The preceding rotor-bearing model was extended to represent the turbocharger rotor-cartridge system that is under consideration. A DEM angular contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> cartridge model was coupled with an EFEM shaft to simulate the dynamics of the turbocharger test rig. The bearing cartridge consists of a common outer ring, a pair of split inner races, and a row of balls on each end of the cartridge. The coupled rotor-cartridge model was used to investigate the shaft motion and bearing dynamics as the system traverses critical speeds. The analytical and experimental shaft motion results were in close agreement. The cartridge model allowed for thorough investigation of bearing component dynamics. Effects of ball material properties were found to have a significant impact on turbocharger rotor and bearing dynamics. ...|$|R
