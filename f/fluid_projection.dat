40|$|A {{well-established}} numerical {{approach to}} solve the Navier [...] Stokes equations for incompressible fluids is Chorin's projection method, whereby the fluid velocity is explicitly updated, and then an elliptic problem for the pressure is solved, {{which is used to}} orthogonally project the velocity field to maintain the incompressibility constraint. In this paper, we develop a mathematical correspondence between Newtonian fluids in the incompressible limit and hypo-elastoplastic solids in the slow, quasi-static limit. Using this correspondence, we formulate a new fixed-grid, Eulerian numerical method for simulating quasi-static hypo-elastoplastic solids, whereby the stress is explicitly updated, and then an elliptic problem for the velocity is solved, which is used to orthogonally project the stress to maintain the quasi-staticity constraint. We develop a finite-difference implementation of the method and apply it to an elasto-viscoplastic model of a bulk metallic glass based on the shear transformation zone theory. We show that in a two-dimensional plane strain simple shear simulation, the method is in quantitative agreement with an explicit method. Like the <b>fluid</b> <b>projection</b> method, it is efficient and numerically robust, making it practical {{for a wide variety of}} applications. We also demonstrate that the method can be extended to simulate objects with evolving boundaries. We highlight a number of correspondences between incompressible fluid mechanics and quasi-static elastoplasticity, creating possibilities for translating other numerical methods between the two classes of physical problems.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 41). Advances {{in stage}} automation and projection design {{in recent years}} have provided new design tools to bridge the visual conversation of contemporary theatre into the technology driven 21 st century. A variety of solutions exist to achieve fluid design. This project explored the concept of moving projection images around a stage by using an existing automation and projection software partnership with Creative Conners??? Spikemark??? automation software and Dataton???s Watchout??? projection software. Using the automation system, I moved a projection screen along a motion path. The automation software sent its position information to the projection software so the projected content followed the moving screen. Proof of this technology???s ability to enhance the visual movement of stage design was showcased in the projection design for the SDSU School of Theatre???s production of Alice: Curiouser and Curiouser, an adaptation of Lewis Carrol???s Alice in Wonderland. Amidst a multiscreen projection environment, I used tracking projections to further enhance the visual interest created by the overall projection design. The overall goal for this project was to deliver an analysis of my user experience with this software partnership in order to make contributions to the research for improving the system???s tuning process that would achieve greater tracking image quality. Separately, these two technology systems are readily available in both regional and university theatre. Thus, improving the process of this system partnership will have a far reaching effect on improving <b>fluid</b> <b>projection</b> design in theatrical environments...|$|E

The conserved (super) charges of the Chaplygin gas are obtained as {{the projection of}} those arising in the extended model. ...|$|R

40|$|Communicated by Jean-Luc Guermond) Abstract. We {{introduce}} a finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We use a triangular mesh. The unknowns for the velocity and pressure are both piecewise constant (colocated scheme). We use a projection (fractional-step) method {{to deal with}} the incompressibility constraint. We prove that the differential operators in the Navier-Stokes equations and their discrete counterparts share similar properties. In particular, we state an inf-sup (BabuË‡ska-Brezzi) condition. We infer from it the stability of the scheme. Key Words. Incompressible <b>fluids,</b> Navier-Stokes equations, <b>projection</b> methods and finite volume. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFluid-structure {{interaction}} {{plays an}} important role in nuclear engineering design, where several numerical and experimental tests need to be performed on new tank design before getting into the production process. The design can be performed for fluid storage tanks that require knowledge of sloshing frequencies and hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the structure. These can be very useful for engineers and designers to define appropriate material properties and shell thickness of the structure to be resistant under seismic loading. Data presented in current tank seismic design codes such as Eurocode are based on simplified assumptions for the geometry and material tank properties. Fuel tanks may undergo different types of loading, including seismic loading, where the behavior of storage tanks includes material nonlinearities, which are caused by material yielding. The Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation based on finite element analysis presented in the paper takes into account material properties of the structure as well as the complex geometry of the tank. The formulation uses a moving mesh with a mesh velocity defined through the structure motion. In this paper, we use different approaches to solve a fluid-structure coupling problem. The first one uses the full Navier-Stokes equation for the <b>fluid</b> with <b>projection</b> method, and the second approach uses potential flow theory. The problem consists of a sloshing deformable tank submitted to acceleration loading...|$|R
40|$|The {{conclusions}} {{of this report}} are: (1) Bert Winn No. 1 did not encounter high-temperature zones of permeability, except possibly at 5, 575 to 5, 700 feet, where chloride conductivity indicates saline fluid entry, and where stabilized temperature may be 210 - 215 F. (2) Structurally, Bert Winn No. 1 appears to have penetrated into the horst footwall block, penetrating progressively away from the horst-bounding faults believed to leak hot <b>fluids.</b> (3) <b>Projections</b> based on disequilibrium temperatures taken at 24 and 36 hours suggest a stabilized maximum temperature of about 260 - 265 F at 7, 450. Maximum observed temperature was 243 F. (4) Geochemically, temperatures at depth should be over 300 F. On the basis of observed temperatures and gradients, 400 F might not be encountered until 12, 000 feet at this site. (5) C. H. Stocks 1 -A, about one mile northwest, appears to be hotter at comparable depths, and to be better located to penetrate the range-front fault set at drillable depth. (6) Bert Winn No. 1 was sited principally on a geoelectrical anomaly {{in an area of}} high temperature gradients. With the remote exception of the saline interval at 5, 575 to 5, 700 feet, no evidence was seen in drilling and logging of any feature that could serve as the source of the geoelectrical anomaly...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{transient}} response of submerged two-dimensional thin shell subjected to weak acoustical or mechanical excitations is {{addressed in this}} paper. The proposed approach is first exposed in a detailed manner: {{it is based on}} Laplace transform in time, in vacuo eigenvector expansion with time-dependent coefficients for the structural dynamics and boundary-integral formulation for the <b>fluid.</b> The <b>projection</b> of the <b>fluid</b> pressure on the in vacuo eigenvectors leads to a fully coupled system involving the modal time-dependent displacement coefficients, which are the problem unknowns. They are simply determined by matrix inversion in the Laplace domain. Application of the method to the response of a 2 D immersed shell to a weak acoustical excitation is then exposed: the proposed test-case corresponds to the design of immersed structures subjected to underwater explosions, which is of paramount importance in naval shipbuilding. Comparison of a numerical calculation based on the proposed approach with an analytical solution is exposed; versatility of the method is also highlighted by referring to "classical" FEM/FEM or FEM/BEM simulations. As a conspicuous feature of the method, calculation of the fluid response functions corresponding to a given geometry has to be performed once, allowing various simulations for different material properties of the structure, as well as for various excitations on the structure. This versatile approach can therefore be efficiently and extensively used for design purposes...|$|R
40|$|An isotropic-anisotropic shift 2 D {{correlation}} spectroscopy is introduced that combines {{the advantages of}} both magic angle turning (MAT) and magic angle hopping (MAH) technologies. In this new approach, denoted DMAT for "discrete magic angle turning", the sample rotates clockwise followed by an anticlockwise rotation of exactly the same amount with each rotation less or equal than 360 degrees but greater than 240 degrees, with the rotation speed being constant only for times related to the evolution dimension. This back and forth rotation is repeated and synchronized with a special radio frequency (RF) pulse sequence to produce an isotropic-anisotropic shift 2 D correlation spectrum. For any spin-interaction of rank- 2 such as chemical shift anisotropy, isotropic magnetic susceptibility interaction, and residual homo-nuclear dipolar interaction in biological <b>fluid</b> samples, the <b>projection</b> along the isotropic dimension is a high resolution spectrum. Since a less than 360 degrees sample rotation is involved, the design potentially allows for in situ control over physical parameters such as pressure, flow conditions, feed compositions, and temperature so that true in situ NMR investigations can be carried out.

40|$|The {{turbulent}} {{boundary layer}} is an aspect of fluid flow which dominates the performance of many engineering systems - yet the analytic solution of such flows is intractable for most applications. Our understanding of boundary layers is therefore limited by our ability to simulate and measure them. Tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (TPIV) is a recently developed technique for direct measurement of fluid velocity within a 3 D region. This allows new insight into the topological structure of {{turbulent boundary layer}}s. Increasing Reynolds Number increases the range of scales at which turbulence exists; a measurement technique must have a larger 'dynamic range' to fully resolve the flow. Tomographic PIV is currently limited in spatial dynamic range (which is also linked to the spatial and temporal resolution) due to {{a high degree of}} noise. Results also contain significant bias error. This work proposes a modification of the technique to use more than two exposures in the PIV process, which (for four exposures) is shown to improve random error by a factor of 2 to 7 depending on experimental setup parameters. The dynamic range increases correspondingly and can be doubled again in highly turbulent flows. Bias error is reduced by up to 40 %. An alternative reconstruction approach is also presented, based on application of a reduction strategy (elimination of coefficients based on a first guess) to the tomographic weightings matrix Wij. This facilitates a potentially significant increase in computational efficiency. Despite the achieved reduction in error, measurements contain non-zero divergence due to noise and sampling errors. The same problem affects visualisation of topology and coherent <b>fluid</b> structures. Using <b>Projection</b> Onto Convex Sets, a framework for post-processing operators is implemented which includes a divergence minimisation procedure and a scale-limited denoising strategy which is resilient to 'false' vectors contained in the data. Finally, developed techniques are showcased by visualisation of topological information in the inner region of a high Reynolds Number boundary layer (Î´+ = 1890, ReÎ¸ = 3650). Comments are made on the visible flow structures and tentative conclusions are drawn. This work was partly supported by the Trinity Hall 'Brockhouse' Scholarship...|$|R
