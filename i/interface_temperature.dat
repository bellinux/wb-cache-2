40|$|Pool boiling {{serves as}} {{physical}} model problem for electronics cooling {{by means of}} phase-change heat transfer. Key for optimal and reliable cooling capacity is {{better understanding of the}} conditions that determine the critical heat flux (CHF). Exceeding CHF results in transition from efficient nucleate boiling to inefficient film boiling. This transition intimately related to the formation and stability of multiple (steady) states on the interface. To this end the steady-state behaviour of a three-dimensionalpool-boiling problem has been studied in terms of arepresentative mathematical model problem. This model problem involves only the temperature field within the heater and models the heat exchange with the boiling medium via a nonlinear boundary condition imposed on the fluid-heater interface. The steady-state behaviour is investigated via a bifurcation analysis with acontinuation algorithm based upon treatment of the model with the method of separation of variables and a Fourier-collocation method. This revealed that steady-state solutions with homogeneous <b>interface</b> <b>temperatures</b> may undergo bifurcations that result in multiple solutions with essentially heterogeneous <b>interface</b> <b>temperatures.</b> These heterogeneous states phenomenologically correspond with vapour patches (`dry spots') on the interface that characterise transitionconditions. The findings on the model problem are consistent with laboratory experiments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: In {{the current}} work, an {{experimental}} investigations on friction and <b>interface</b> <b>temperature</b> of {{chopped strand mat}} glass fibre (type-R) reinforced polyester (CGRP) sliding against smooth stainless steel are presented. Pin-on-disk (POD) apparatus was used to perform the experimental tests under dry contact condition. Several tribo-parameters are considered, namely load (30, 60 & 90 N), sliding velocity (2. 8, 3. 52 & 3. 9 m/s) and sliding distance (0 - 2. 51 km). In addition, the CGRP composite was investigated in two different orientations of chopped strand mat (CSM) glass fibre in the matrix, with respect to sliding direction and counterface, i. e. Parallel (P) and Anti-parallel (AP). Friction forces and interface temperatures were measured simultaneously. To observe the damages feature on the worn surface of CGRP composite, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used. The results of friction coefficient and <b>interface</b> <b>temperature</b> were presented as function of sliding distance at different loads, velocities and orientations. Experimental results revealed that orientations of CSM glass fibres and test parameters {{played a major role}} in friction and <b>interface</b> <b>temperature</b> behaviour. Tested parameters (load, sliding distance, sliding velocity and orientations of CSM glass fibre in matrix) have an essential influence on the friction coefficient and <b>interface</b> <b>temperature</b> results of the CGRP composite.

40|$|International audienceThe {{question}} of the transient interface conditions in various severe accident situations, involving multicomponent and multi-phase material mixtures has until now remained largely unresolved. The <b>interface</b> <b>temperature</b> controls melt temperature and transient heat-flux distribution. The present paper proposes {{a new approach to}} the transient <b>interface</b> <b>temperature,</b> drawing on the numerous past efforts. A single relation is proposed which applies to various severe accident situations: (i) thermal-hydraulic steady state for in-vessel retention (IVR); (ii) transient solidification; (iii) transient concrete ablation (MCCI); and (iv) refractory material (ceramic) ablation (core-catcher retention, liner design). This approach yields the following important conclusions: - When a thermal-hydraulic steady state can be reached (external cooling, in case of IVR and melt stabilization in an externally cooled core-catcher), the melt-solid <b>interface</b> <b>temperature</b> tends towards the liquidus temperature corresponding to the melt composition. - During the ablation transient: the <b>interface</b> <b>temperature</b> is lower than the melt liquidus temperature if the wall-melting temperature is less than the melt liquidus temperature (MCCI), the <b>interface</b> <b>temperature</b> is higher than the melt liquidus temperature if the melting temperature of the wall exceeds the melt liquidus (oxidic corium-refractory ceramic interaction). The new interface model also suggests that simultaneous ablation of two similar walls (for instance: two concrete walls) may be subject to instabilities which can potentially result in complete arrest of the ablation of one of the walls. In the case of simultaneous ablation of two walls of different nature, the wall with the lowest melting temperature is preferentially ablated during the transient phase...|$|E

A loosely coupled strategy is adopted with each field solution providing boundary {{conditions for the}} other in an iteration seeking continuity of temperature and heat flux at the fluid-solid interface. The NASA Glenn Navier-Stokes code Glenn-HT is coupled to a 3 -D BEM steady state heat conduction code developed at the University of Central Florida.

Another quadratic model shows the variation of chip-tool interface with major interaction effect between cutting speed and depth of cut (V*D) and second order (quadratic) effect of cutting speed (V 2) appears to be highly significant.
