25|$|Egyptian {{president}} Hosni Mubarak's {{national security}} advisor, Osama El-Baz, {{sent a message}} to the U.S. State Department that the Iraqis wanted to discuss the accusations that the country <b>had</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction and ties with Al-Qaeda. Iraq also attempted to reach the U.S. through the Syrian, French, German, and Russian intelligence services.|$|E
25|$|Since Pakistan and India each <b>had</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction, {{many in the}} {{international}} community were concerned that if the Kargil conflict intensified, it could lead to nuclear war. Both countries had tested their nuclear capability in 1998 (India conducted its first test in 1974 while it was Pakistan's first-ever nuclear test). Many pundits believed the tests to be an indication of the escalating stakes in the scenario in South Asia. When the Kargil conflict started just a year after the nuclear tests, many nations desired to end it before it intensified.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, {{prior to}} the Blair/Bush {{invasion}} of Iraq on the pretext that Iraq <b>had</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction, Kroto initiated and organised {{the publication of a}} letter to be signed by a dozen UK Nobel Laureates and published in the Times. [...] It was composed by his friend the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate the late Sir Joseph Rotblat and published in The Times on 15 February 2003.|$|E

5000|$|January 21, 2003: Bush says of Saddam [...] "He <b>has</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> {{destruction}} -- the world's deadliest weapons -- which pose {{a direct}} threat to the United States, our citizens and our friends and allies." ...|$|R
2500|$|In December 2002, a {{representative}} of the head of Iraqi Intelligence, the General Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, contacted former Central Intelligence Agency Counterterrorism Department head Vincent Cannistraro stating that Saddam [...] "knew there was a campaign to link him to 11 September and prove he <b>had</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction (WMDs)." [...] Cannistraro further added that [...] "the Iraqis were prepared to satisfy these concerns. I reported the conversation to senior levels of the state department and I was told to stand aside and they would handle it." [...] Cannistraro stated that the offers made were all [...] "killed" [...] by the George W. Bush administration because they allowed Saddam to remain in power, an outcome viewed as unacceptable. It has been suggested that Saddam Hussein was prepared to go into exile if allowed to keep $1 billion USD.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 June 2008, IAEA {{inspectors}} {{were allowed}} to visit the Dair Alzour site (also referred to as Al Kibar), and take samples of the debris. On 19 November 2008 an IAEA report stated that [...] "a significant number of natural uranium particles" [...] produced {{as a result of}} chemical processing were found at the Al Kibar site; however, the IAEA did not find sufficient evidence to prove Syria is developing nuclear weapons. Some American nuclear experts have speculated about similarities between the alleged Syrian reactor and North Korea's Yongybon reactor but IAEA Director General ElBaradei has pointed out that [...] "there was uranium but it doesn't mean there was a reactor". ElBaradei has shown dissatisfaction with the United States and Israel for only providing the IAEA with photos of the bombed facility in Syria, and has also urged caution against prematurely judging Syria's atomic program by reminding diplomats about false U.S. claims that Saddam Hussein <b>had</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction. Russia, China, Iran, and non-aligned countries have also supported giving Syria nuclear guidance despite pressure from the United States.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2016, {{during the}} first presidential debate, Trump said he doubted whether anyone knew who hacked the DNC, and disputed Russian interference. During the second debate, Trump said there {{might not have been}} hacking at all, and {{questioned}} why accountability was placed on Russia. During the third debate, Trump rejected Clinton's claim that Putin favored Trump. After the election, Trump rejected the CIA analysis and asserted that the reports were politically motivated to deflect from the Democrats' electoral defeat. Trump's transition team said in a brief statement: [...] "These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein <b>had</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction." [...] However, the intelligence analysts involved in monitoring Russian activities are different from those who assessed that Iraq had stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, while postâ€“Iraq War reforms have made it less likely for similar errors to reach {{the highest levels of the}} U.S. intelligence community. Trump dismissed reports of Russia's interference, calling them [...] "ridiculous"; he placed blame on Democrats upset over election results for publicizing these reports, and cited Julian Assange's statement that [...] "a 14-year-old kid could have hacked Podesta." [...] After Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats and announced further sanctions on Russia, Trump commended Putin for refraining from retaliatory measures against the United States until the Trump administration would lay out its policy towards Russia.|$|E

5000|$|... "Iraq <b>has</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction. This is not {{something}} we think. We know it. Iraq has itself admitted that it had mustard gas, nerve gas, anthrax, but Saddam will not settle. He will not tell us where and how the <b>weapons</b> <b>have</b> been destroyed. We know from the UN inspectors, so {{there is no doubt in}} my mind." ...|$|R

50|$|In 2003, Miliband {{voted to}} go to war in Iraq. Later, in 2010, he said that his {{decision}} was based on his belief that Iraq then <b>had</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction.|$|E
50|$|On February 6, 2004, Lloyd Cutler was {{appointed}} to the Iraq Intelligence Commission, an independent panel tasked with investigating U.S. intelligence surrounding the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the allegations that Iraq <b>had</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a commentary on}} Ulf Sundehaussen's "Terrorism and America" which is highly critical of recent U. S. policy in combating the threat of terrorism. This article also correctly indites the US, with its vast arsenal <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> including cluster bombs, missiles and nuclear weapons, as being a country that actually does <b>have</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction...|$|R
5000|$|After the Chilcot Report {{investigating}} the Iraq War was released, Donohoe stated he was [...] "not convinced" [...] it gave any fresh {{insight into the}} controversial decision to invade Iraq. Donohoe had voted for the invasion, but {{a year later he}} said he would have voted against had he known Iraq did not <b>have</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, Lukashenko gave {{a speech}} to the Belorussian parliament, stating that the war in Iraq was about oil for the US which was heavily censored and removed from Western {{mainstream}} media. He stated that a western politician visited him, coercing him, attempting to buy him off by telling him to lie to the international community, saying that Iraq <b>has</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction.|$|R
5000|$|Likewise, the {{implication}} that Iraq {{was involved in the}} 9-11 attacksor <b>had</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction, based on evidence that the CIA's own reports had dismissed, was described as [...] "policy by press release" [...] by John Kerry and Lou Dobbs.|$|E
5000|$|On January 7, 2002, Turkish Army {{chief of}} General Staff General Huseyin Kivrikoglu's made a {{statement}} that Armenia <b>had</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction.

5000|$|In the book, CIA {{director}} George Tenet {{is noted}} as stating {{the evidence that}} Saddam Hussein <b>had</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction was [...] "a slam dunk".

50|$|Slim Charles {{uses this}} phrase to {{convince}} Avon Barksdale {{of the need}} to see their war with Marlo Stanfield through to the finish now that it is underway, even though the pretense for retaliation (the death of Stringer Bell {{at the hands of the}} Stanfield organization) is false. It is also a reference to the war in Iraq, fought on the lie <b>of</b> Saddam Hussein <b>having</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction.|$|R
5000|$|When {{deciding}} {{to retire from}} Congress in 2012, Dicks said his biggest regret was voting for the Iraq War. [...] "I'm still glad Saddam Hussein is not there, but I feel we were misled, not intentionally misled, but we were not given accurate information, and if we had known Saddam Hussein did not <b>have</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction, I don't think Congress would even {{have been asked to}} vote on that." ...|$|R

5000|$|According to an Arab {{source of}} the Guardian, Perle sent a Saudi {{official}} the following terms for Iraq to fulfill to prevent war: [...] "Saddam's abdication and departure, first to a US military base for interrogation and then into supervised exile, a surrender of Iraqi troops, and the admission that Iraq <b>had</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly after, Egyptian {{president}} Hosni Mubarak's {{national security}} advisor, Osama El-Baz, {{sent a message}} to the U.S. State Department that the Iraqis wanted to discuss the accusations that Saddam <b>had</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction and ties with al-Qaeda.

2500|$|Mr. President, {{yesterday}} {{in a statement}} you admitted that Iraq did not <b>have</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction, but justified the invasion by stating [...] I quote [...] "he retained the knowledge, the materials, the means, and the intent to produce <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction, and could have passed this knowledge to our terrorist enemies." [...] Do you sincerely believe {{this to be a}} reasonable justification for invasion when this statement applies to so many other countries, including North Korea? ...|$|R

50|$|Although Yuan {{told the}} {{remaining}} candidates {{that they were}} accepted {{as a member of}} the Unit A, there was a final test ahead, but no one knew about it. One day, Yuan told them to get ready to deploy into a chemical factory to eliminate a group of terrorists who claimed to <b>have</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction. The deployment became chaos and the candidates' team members were out of contact. All candidates believed that they were in a real situation.|$|R
5000|$|Scott Shane of The New York Times said [...] "perhaps {{if we had}} {{had more}} {{information}} on these secret internal deliberations of governments prior to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, {{we would have had}} {{a better understanding of the}} quality of the evidence that Saddam Hussein <b>had</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction.

50|$|Since 2009, Britton {{hosted a}} series for BBC One called Fern Britton Meets... {{in which she}} interviewed {{high-profile}} personalities about their religious beliefs.

2500|$|I think [...] {{has stated}} that Iraq <b>has</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction, and that's as simple as {{they want to keep}} it. They don't {{want to get into the}} nitty-gritty things such as if you bury a Scud missile to hide it from detection, there is a little thing called corrosion. Where do you hide the fuel, how do you make this stuff up, how do you align it. Because when you {{disassemble}} it, there is a process called re-alignment. There is a factory involved in that. And then you have to test launch it to make sure that the alignment works, and that's detectable, and they haven't done that. There is a lot of common sense things that go into consideration of whether or not Iraq <b>has</b> a operational <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction capability.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{run up to}} the 2003 Iraq War, he {{addressed}} parliament saying [...] "The body of evidence that Saddam Hussein possesses a fearsome range <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction is substantial.. Let us be clear: Saddam Hussein <b>has</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction {{and he is a}} threat to his people, his neighbours and ultimately {{the middle east and the}} wider world.

2500|$|Despite {{identifying}} {{himself as}} a Republican and having voted for George W.

His views at that time are well summarized in [...] a 2002 publication which consists largely of an interview between Ritter and anti-war activist William Rivers Pitt.
