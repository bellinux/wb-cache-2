40|$|Background: The <b>fruit</b> of the <b>date</b> palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} fruits in the world. Hundreds of varieties having different texture, color, and flavor are available for valorization and adoption in food processing operations. Such utilization should be based on the fruit valuable characteristics; mainly its richness in dietary fiber and phenolic antioxidants. Scope and approach: This review article complements these existing reviews by primarily addressing the chemistry and processing of <b>date</b> <b>fruits</b> pulp and seeds with particular emphasis on dietary fiber and antioxidants as linked to important fruit processing and utilization features. Key findings and conclusions: <b>Date</b> <b>fruits</b> contain 6. 5 – 11. 5 % total dietary fibers (of which 84 – 94 % insoluble and 6 – 16 % soluble dietary fiber) and is very rich in phenolic antioxidants (1 – 2 %) especially condensed tannin pigments based on (−) -epicatechin oligomers. Date seeds contain about 15 % of fiber, characterized by a high level of water-insoluble mannan fibers. <b>Date</b> <b>fruits</b> are widely available in the global market, mainly at mature Tamr stage, but there is still room for improvement. It has been suggested that <b>date</b> <b>fruits</b> and seeds can be exploited in some food applications utilizing their high levels of fiber and antioxidants.

Objective: We investigated whether dietary supplementation with 2 % and 4 % <b>date</b> palm <b>fruits</b> (grown in Oman) could reduce cognitive and behavioral deficits in a transgenic mouse model for AD (amyloid precursor protein [APPsw]/Tg 2576). Materials and Methods: The experimental groups of APP-transgenic mice from the age of 4 months were fed custom-mix diets (pellets) containing 2 % and 4 % <b>date</b> <b>fruits.</b> We assessed spatial memory and learning ability, psychomotor coordination, and anxiety-related behavior in all the animals at the age of 4 months and after 14 months of treatment using the Morris water maze test, rota-rod test, elevated plus maze test, and open-field test. We have also analyzed the levels of amyloid beta (Aβ) protein (1 - 40 and 1 - 42) in plasma of control and experimental animals. Results: Standard diet-fed Tg mice showed significant memory deficits, increased anxiety-related behavior, and severe impairment in spatial learning ability, position discrimination learning ability and motor coordination when compared to wild-type on the same diet and Tg mice fed 2 % and 4 % date supplementation at the age of 18 months. The levels of both Aβ proteins were significantly lowered in <b>date</b> <b>fruits</b> supplemented groups than the Tg mice without the diet supplement. The neuroprotective effect offered by 4 % <b>date</b> <b>fruits</b> diet to AD mice is higher than 2 % <b>date</b> <b>fruits</b> diet.

Coccidiosis was induced by infection of mice with 1. 5 × 103 sporulated oocysts of E. papillata. The aqueous extract of <b>date</b> <b>fruit</b> (4 ml/kg) was used in vivo for its hepatoprotective properties. Anticoccidial and anti-inflammatory activities of <b>date</b> <b>fruit</b> were determined through oocyst output and liver histopathology, respectively. The data showed that mice infected with E. papillata revealed an output of about 8. 7 × 103 oocysts per gram faeces on day 4 post-inoculation (p. i.). This output significantly decreased to about 6. 7 × 103 oocysts in date fruit-treated mice. Infection caused a marked liver injury as indicated by histopathological alterations as well as the significant increase in liver glutamic pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Also, infection induced a significant increase in total protein and total lipids. The aqueous extract of P. dactylifera fruit showed a significant (P 0. 05) hepatoprotective potential by improving the aforementioned parameters.

Therefore, this study is an attempt to develop a procedure to utilize the solar energy to destroy date insects as an alternative method to the fumigation process. Thus, the goal of this research was to study the heat penetration curves of solar energy into three varieties of <b>date</b> <b>fruits</b> (Sefri, Seri and Khudari). Temperatures of three locations were recorded during solar exposure (inside the <b>date</b> <b>fruits,</b> inside the solar collector and the surrounding atmosphere temperature). Mathematical models were developed for the heating curves. Fruit color and moisture content before and after solar heating were determined as quality parameters. The heat penetration rates and quality parameters depend on the date variety as well as the surrounding temperature. Kinetic models were applied to indicate the effectiveness of solar energy in the destruction of Oryzaephilus surinamensis: Silvanidae insects inside <b>date</b> <b>fruits.</b> Modeling results indicate that solar energy can be used to destroy the insects with little change of date quality...|$|R

40|$|Background - The <b>fruit</b> of the <b>date</b> palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} fruits in the world. Hundreds of varieties having different texture, color, and flavor are available for valorization and adoption in food processing operations. Such utilization should be based on the fruit valuable characteristics; mainly its richness in dietary fiber and phenolic antioxidants. Scope and approach - This review article complements these existing reviews by primarily addressing the chemistry and processing of <b>date</b> <b>fruits</b> pulp and seeds with particular emphasis on dietary fiber and antioxidants as linked to important fruit processing and utilization features. Key findings and conclusions - <b>Date</b> <b>fruits</b> contain 6. 5 – 11. 5...|$|R
