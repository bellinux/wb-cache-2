40|$|Abstract — Safety {{concerns}} {{arise when}} planning for systems with dynamics among moving obstacles, where a collision-free trajectory {{leads to an}} Inevitable Collision State (ICS). Identifying whether a state is ICS, however, is computationally challenging. This has led to approximations, varying from conservative schemes, which never characterize an <b>ICS</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> safe state, to schemes with weaker guarantees but fast online resolution of an ICS query. The computational cost of the approach is critical in problems that require replanning. This report presents various alternatives for identifying whether a state is ICS from the related literature. It also discusses different ways for integrating such schemes with sampling-based planners in safe replanning frameworks so as to reduce the computational overhead of avoiding ICS. I...|$|E
40|$|Several studies {{suggested}} {{an association between}} the regular use of Î² 2 -agonists and asthma deaths. Whether this association represents adverse effects of Î²-agonist use or is entirely due to disease severity {{is a matter of}} ongoing debate. Previous literature indicates that confounding by poor asthma control may explain the apparent deleterious effects of inhaled Î² 2 -agonists. Tolerance to nonbronchodilator effects of Î² 2 -agonists may account for the increase in reactivity to indirect bronchoconstrictor challenges and explain why some studies have demonstrated enhanced bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma after regular Î² 2 -agonist therapy. Nonetheless, the salmeterol multi-centre asthma research trial (SMART) found more asthma deaths (13 vs 3) and life-threatening asthma events (37 vs 22) in the salmeterol-treated asthmatic patients, although it was documented that among African-Americans, 5 times as many deaths and near-deaths from asthma occurred in those given salmeterol than in those given placebo, and among patients with asthma not using an inhaled corticosteroid (<b>ICS)</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> preventive (controller) medication, again more deaths and near-deaths from asthma occurred in those given salmeterol than in those given placebo. Only 38 % of the African-Americans who participated in the study used an <b>ICS.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of the findings from the SMART, FDA issued a public health advisory to highlight that long-acting Î² 2 -agonists (LABAs) should not be the first medicine used to treat asthma. LABAs should be added to the asthma treatment plan only if other medicines, including the use of low-or-medium dose ICSs, do not control asthma. However, despite all of the concerns raised by the SMART, inhaled Î² 2 -agonists remain the most effective bronchodilators available for the immediate relief of asthma symptoms and, as such, remain an important component of asthma management. Obviously, there are concerns about LABA treatment as monotherapy for asthma. Patients with asthma should be initiated and maintained on sufficiently high doses of ICSs and only patients whose asthma cannot be controlled should receive additional LABAs on a regular basis.

40|$|Abstract: Kinetic {{studies of}} the early events in {{cytochrome}} c folding are reviewed {{with a focus on}} the evidence for folding intermediates on the submillisecond timescale. Evidence from time-resolved absorption, circular dichroism, magnetic circular dichroism, fluorescence energy and electron transfer, small-angle X-ray scattering and amide hydrogen exchange studies on the t � 1 ms timescale reveals a picture of cytochrome c folding that starts with the ~ 1 -�s conformational diffusion dynamics of the unfolded chains. A fractional population of the unfolded chains collapses on the 1 – 100 �s timescale to a compact intermediate IC containing some native-like secondary structure. Although the existence and nature of <b>IC</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> discrete folding intermediate remains controversial, there is extensive high time-resolution kinetic evidence for the rapid formation of <b>IC</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> true intermediate, i. e., a metastable state separated from the unfolded state by a discrete free energy barrier. Final folding to the native state takes place on millisecond and longer timescales, depending on the presence of kinetic traps such as heme misligation and proline mis-isomerization. The high folding rates observed in equilibrium molten globule models suggest that IC may be a productive folding intermediate. Whether it is an obligatory step on the pathway to the high free energy barrier associated with millisecond timescale folding to the native state, however, remains to be determined...|$|R
