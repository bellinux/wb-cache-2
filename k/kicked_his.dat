On the Bears' next drive, Jones {{started out with a}} 14-yard run, and then Muhammad caught a 9-yard pass, bringing up second down and one on the Colts' 45-yard line. But on the next play, Grossman was sacked for an 11-yard loss by Anthony McFarland. Then, on third down, he fumbled the snap. Grossman recovered the fumble himself, but the Bears were forced to punt, and Wilkins {{returned the}} ball 12yards to the Colts' 36-yard line. Rhodes then gained 52yards on four carries, with a facemask penalty adding another 10.

5|$|Donning their throwback uniforms, the Steelers {{played the}} Baltimore Ravens {{in their first}} Monday Night game of the season. Multiple Steelers {{starters}} did not play in the game, due to various injuries. After a 3–3 first quarter, Baltimore took a ten-point lead into half time with a field goal and touchdown pass in the second quarter. Rashard Mendenhall—in his first NFL start—left {{the game in the}} third quarter with a season-ending shoulder injury. On Pittsburgh's third drive of the half, Roethlisberger connected with Santonio Holmes for a 38-yard touchdown pass. On the first play of Baltimore's ensuing drive, James Harrison's forced fumble was picked up by LaMarr Woodley and returned 7yards for a touchdown. The two touchdowns within 15seconds took the Steelers from ten points behind to four points ahead. In the final quarter, the Steelers' offense was stopped on the one yard line and Reed <b>kicked</b> <b>his</b> second field goal of the night. Baltimore drove 76yards and tied the game with a touchdown. Neither team was able to score on their final drive as the regulation clock expired.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} match, John Cena defended the WWE Championship against Kurt Angle, with Daivari as the special guest referee. Early in the match, Angle {{was able to}} apply the Ankle lock on Cena. Cena reached the ropes but Daivari <b>kicked</b> <b>his</b> hand off. An angered Cena slapped Daivari, who tried to disqualify him as a result. Angle, however, stopped him, and both men were knocked {{out of the ring}} by Cena. As Daivari was knocked down outside, a Raw referee came out to officiate. After Cena gained the advantage, Angle knocked down the referee, and {{executed}} an illegal low blow. Angle called for another referee, but failed to get the win after executing an Angle Slam and a superplex. After Angle missed a moonsault, Cena went for an FU but Angle countered by holding onto the referee, which led to Angle knocking down the referee. As the other referee was knocked out, SmackDown referee Charles Robinson came out. Cena then delivered a DDT to Daivari and executed an FU on Angle, pinning him to retain the title.|$|E

5|$|Nebraska {{began its}} {{possession}} at its five-yard line after the returner was tackled for a three-yard loss and the Cornhuskers were assessed six yards of penalties during the return. Frost threw an incomplete pass, Schuster ran for four yards, then Frost completed a 14-yard pass to Shevin Wiggins {{for a first}} down at the Nebraska 23-yard line. Frost continued the drive by earning nine yards on an option, then Schuster picked up three yards for another first down. Sims followed this by gaining 22 yards and two first downs on the next three plays. Frost then completed a 17-yard throw to Jeff Lake for a first down at Tech's 26-yard line. Just outside Tech's red zone, however, the drive petered out. Sims was stopped for a short loss, Frost ran for eight yards, and threw an incomplete pass, causing a fourth down. Kris Brown <b>kicked</b> <b>his</b> second field goal of the game, this time a 37-yard kick, which was successful. With 7:52 remaining in the game, Nebraska had a 3421 lead.|$|E
5|$|Reed <b>kicked</b> <b>his</b> second {{field goal}} of the game from 41-yards to give the Steelers the lead going into the final quarter. The Chargers drove 74yards on 17plays, {{converting}} on a field goal {{to give them the}} lead again, with 6:45 remaining. On the Steelers' ensuing drive, the offense drove 73yards and Reed converted on his third field {{goal of the}} day, giving the Steelers an 11–10 lead with 15seconds remaining in regulation. The Chargers attempted to score on their final play, but Troy Polamalu forced and recovered a fumble, returning it for a touchdown. The call was reversed when the officials ruled that San Diego had made an illegal forward pass. After the game, head referee Scott Green admitted that the touchdown should have been counted. With the touchdown not counted the final score kept Pittsburgh under the 5point spread by which they were favored, and resulted in over $32million being lost in bets. The game was the first regular season game in NFL history to end with a final score of 11–10.|$|E
5|$|The second {{main event}} match had Bearer's Undertaker {{fighting}} DiBiase's Undertaker. After DiBiase's Undertaker {{walked to the}} ring, Bearer appeared by himself while pushing a casket to the ring. He reached inside the casket and pulled out an urn, which had a light inside it when Bearer removed its lid. Bearer's Undertaker came to the ring and confronted DiBiase's Undertaker. Both wrestlers were wearing identical costumes, but Bearer's Undertaker wore purple while DiBiase's wore grey. Bearer's Undertaker <b>kicked</b> <b>his</b> opponent out of the ring, where DiBiase's Undertaker tried to attack Bearer. DiBiase's Undertaker attempted to perform an arm twist ropewalk chop, but Bearer's Undertaker stopped him and performed the move. DiBiase's Undertaker then performed a chokeslam and a Tombstone piledriver. As he tried for another Tombstone piledriver, Bearer's Undertaker reversed it and performed the move. Bearer's Undertaker then performed two more Tombstone piledrivers before getting the pinfall victory. A group of people dressed as druids came to ringside, put DiBiase's Undertaker in the casket, and took the casket away.|$|E

5|$|UCF got {{the ball}} to start the game at their nine-yard line after a penalty on the kickoff return, and their junior quarterback Blake Bortles orchestrated an {{efficient}} drive in which he converted two third downs and was 6/7 passing for 65 yards and a 4-yard touchdown pass to Storm Johnson. Penn State took over and got two first downs, the latter of which as a fourth down conversion, before a 44-yard pass to Allen Robinson immediately followed by a 6-yard touchdown run by Zach Zwinak to tie the game. Penn State moved the ball on their next drive, but ultimately turned the ball over on downs giving UCF good field position, with which they ran a two play drive culminating with a 58-yard touchdown run by Johnson to make it 14–7 UCF. Penn State's special teams responded with a 44-yard kickoff return by Geno Lewis, but their offense went three-and-out, and though they punted the ball deep into UCF territory, the Knights marched down the field with a strong running game and scored another touchdown to go up 21–7. On Penn State's ensuing drive, Sam Ficken kicked a career-long 47-yard field goal. UCF got some decent yardage on their next drive, but Bortles threw his first interception since October 27, 2012 with 1:17 in the half, but they ran down the clock and Ficken missed his first field goal attempt of the season, a 57-yard try as time expired. At the half, UCF had 290 total yards including 170 rushing yards, compared to 220 total yards for Penn State with only 89 rushing yards. Penn State {{got the ball}} to start the second half, but punted on their first drive. UCF responded with a touchdown via a 25-yard pass. Penn State came right back with a touchdown of their own. UCF's ensuing drive {{brought them to the}} one yard line, but Penn State held them to a field goal, making the score 31–17. Zwinak rushed for his third touchdown of the game on Penn State's next drive, and Shawn Moffitt <b>kicked</b> <b>his</b> second field goal of the game. Penn State drove 51 yards on their next drive before Zwinak lost a fumble with 5:43 remaining in the game. UCF went three-and-out, and on their punt, the snap went over the punter's head, and Penn State got the ball at the UCF 25. Penn State took advantage, scoring on a 5-yard touchdown pass to Allen Robinson with 57 seconds left. Penn State needed to regain possession of the ball after the score, and failed to do so, so ultimately UCF held on to win by three.|$|E
