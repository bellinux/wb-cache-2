500|$|During this time, Germany {{announced}} plans to send the battlecruiser [...] on a South American cruise. As the ship was [...] "widely advertised as the fastest and most powerful warship then afloat," [...] the United States and United Kingdom felt its presence might give German companies an advantage in potential armament contracts, so they sent ships of their own. The United States sent the new battleship [...] on a ten-week excursion to Brazil and Chile, carrying {{the body of the}} recently deceased Chilean minister, Anibal Cruz, to the United States; the British responded with an armored cruiser squadron. Delawares captain was ordered to give the Chileans full access to the vessel—the only exception being that he should not give <b>full</b> <b>particulars</b> of the new fire-control system—in an attempt by the Navy Department [...] "to aid the shipbuilding interests of the country [...] to make contracts for the building of men-of-war for foreign countries." [...] As a further incentive, the US indicated its willingness to provide a $25million loan to support the purchase of the ship.|$|E

In each case the fertility of the two legitimate unions, taken together, is compared with that of the two illegitimate unions together, by the same two standards as before, namely, by the proportional number of flowers which produced good capsules, and by the average number of seeds per capsule. The fertility of the legitimate unions is always taken at 100.|$|R

60|$|The {{letter of}} the Times' {{correspondent}} referred to contained an account {{of one of the}} most singular cases of depravity ever brought before a criminal court; but it is unnecessary to bring any of its details under the reader's attention, for nearly every other number of our journals has of late contained some instances of atrocities before unthought of, and, it might have seemed, impossible to humanity. The connection of these with the modern love of excitement in the sensational novel and drama may not be generally understood, but it is direct and constant; all furious pursuit of pleasure ending in actual desire of horror and delight in death. I entered into some <b>fuller</b> <b>particulars</b> on this subject in a lecture given in the spring at the Royal Institution.|$|R
