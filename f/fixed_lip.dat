40|$|A {{low speed}} {{wind tunnel test}} of a <b>fixed</b> <b>lip</b> inlet with engine, was performed. The inlet was close coupled to a Hamilton Standard 1. 4 meter, {{variable}} pitch fan driven by a lycoming T 55 -L- 11 A engine. Tests were conducted with various combinations of inlet angle of attack freestream velocities, and fan airflows. Data were recorded to define the inlet airflow separation boundaries, performance characteristics, and fan blade stresses. The test model, installation, instrumentation, test, data reduction and final data are described...|$|E
40|$|The facial {{phenotype}} of psychogenic movement disorders has {{not been}} fully characterized. Seven tertiary-referral movement disorders centers using a standardized data collection on a computerized database performed a retrospective chart review of psychogenic movement disorders involving the face. Patients with organic forms of facial dystonia or any medical or neurological disorder known to affect facial muscles were excluded. Sixty-one patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria for psychogenic facial movement disorders (91. 8 % females; age: 37. 0 ± 11. 3 years). Phasic or tonic muscular spasms resembling dystonia were documented in all patients most commonly involving the lips (60. 7 %), followed by eyelids (50. 8 %), perinasal region (16. 4 %), and forehead (9. 8 %). The most common pattern consisted of tonic, sustained, lateral, and/or downward protrusion of {{one side of the}} lower lip with ipsilateral jaw deviation (84. 3 %). Ipsi- or contralateral blepharospasm and excessive platysma contraction occurred in isolation or combined with <b>fixed</b> <b>lip</b> dystonia (60. 7 %). Spasms were reported as painful in 24. 6 % of cases. Symptom onset was abrupt in most cases (80. 3 %), with at least 1 precipitating psychological stress or trauma identified in 57. 4 %. Associated body regions involved included upper limbs (29. 5 %), neck (16. 4 %), lower limbs (16. 4 %), and trunk (4. 9 %). There were fluctuations in severity and spontaneous exacerbations and remissions (60 %). Prevalent comorbidities included depression (38. 0 %) and tension headache (26. 4 %). Fixed jaw and/or lip deviation is a characteristic pattern of psychogenic facial movement disorders, occurring in isolation or in combination with other psychogenic movement disorders or other psychogenic features. © 2012 Movement Disorder Society...|$|E

60|$|The colour {{rushed into}} Bosinney's face, but soon receded, leaving it sallow-brown as before. He gave a short laugh, that left his <b>lips</b> <b>fixed</b> in a queer, fierce smile; his eyes mocked young Jolyon.|$|R
60|$|Angela {{gave this}} {{information}} slowly, softly, with pauses between the sentences, {{as if she}} were recalling the circumstances with a certain effort; and meanwhile Bernard, with his transfigured face and his eyes <b>fixed</b> upon her <b>lips,</b> was moving excitedly about the room.|$|R

60|$|She went on {{for some}} time, {{introducing}} painters' names, asking questions, skating round the edge of what was personal. And the young man stood before her with a curious little smile <b>fixed</b> on his <b>lips.</b> 'She wants to know whether I'm worth powder and shot,' he thought.|$|R
6000|$|She {{had fallen}} into my arms, and her hands, which touched mine as they fell to her side, were as cold as ice. Her face was like the face of one who has already triumphed over the shadows of death. Far away at our feet the Cross of Calvary was {{standing}} out with rugged vividness against the fast darkening sky and upon it her closing eyes were steadily <b>fixed.</b> Her <b>lips</b> were slightly parted in a happy, confident smile, and her whole being seemed absorbed in the most religious devotion. Once she whispered my name and faintly pressed my hand; then her lips moved again and I heard the dread sound of the solemn prayer, faltered out in a broken whisper, [...] "In manus Tuas, Domine!" ...|$|R
30|$|In some patients, {{the lips}} {{have to be}} pulled to the {{opposite}} side for compensatory contractions. In this case, often the fascia lata is fixed to the opposite lip {{through the center of the}} lips. This method passes the fascial lata extension connected to the temporalis tendon through the tunnel of the upper and lower <b>lips.</b> <b>Fix</b> the fascia lata extension to the center of the upper and lower lips and pull the philtrum and lower lips to the center.|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} {{representatives of the}} Loricariichthys group, mature males develop hypertrophied lips for {{brooding}} eggs. Mature males develop a huge labial veil and teeth with spoon-shaped crowns; females and juveniles, the crowns are pointed. Unlike most loricariids, they don't have well-developed odontodes on the snout and pectoral fins. Eggs are laid in a mass and held by the male in the fold made by its lips. The males bear the cluster of eggs <b>fixed</b> to their <b>lips,</b> which they provide with ventilation during movement. About one week after hatching, the alevins leave their parent's protection.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports the}} {{available}} {{results of an}} ongoing experimental investigation on <b>fixed</b> cold-formed steel <b>lipped</b> channel columns undergoing local-distortional-global mode interaction, i. e., exhibiting nearly coincident local, distortional and global (flexural-torsional) critical buckling loads. After addressing the preliminary buckling analyses, performed to select appropriate column geometries (cross-section dimensions and lengths), {{a detailed description of}} the experimental program carried out at COPPE/UFRJ is provided. Next, the most relevant experimental results obtained during the tests are presented and discussed. Finally, the paper closes with some considerations concerning the design of the columns investigated in this work − in particular, the application of the design expressions currently prescribed by the Direct Strength Method is assessed. ...|$|R
60|$|The young man's {{face was}} almost transformed. His eyes were bright and very <b>fixed.</b> His <b>lips</b> had come {{together}} in a firm, straight line, as though he were renewing some promise to himself. Lady Weybourne followed the direction of his gaze. A man and a girl had reached the entrance to the restaurant and were looking around them as though to select a table. The chief maître d'hôtel had hastened out to receive them. They were, without doubt, people of importance. The man was of medium height, with iron-grey hair and moustache, and a small imperial. He wore light clothes of perfect cut; patent shoes with white linen gaiters; a black tie fastened with a pin of opals. He carried himself with an air which was unmistakable and convincing. The girl by his side was beautiful. She was simply dressed in a tailor-made gown of white serge. Her black hat was a miracle of smartness. Her hair was of a very light shade of golden-brown, her complexion wonderfully fair. Lady Weybourne glanced at her shoes and gloves, at the bag which she was carrying, and the handle of her parasol. Then she nodded approvingly.|$|R
6000|$|The other wheeled {{his horse}} {{to face the}} portal {{resembling}} the high gate of a dismal barn. He raised himself in his stirrups, extended one arm. He was a facetious scoundrel, entertaining for these stupid Occidentals a feeling of great scorn natural in a native from the central provinces. The folly of Esmeraldians especially aroused his amused contempt. He began an oration upon Pedro Montero, keeping a solemn countenance. He flourished his hand as if introducing him to their notice. And when he saw every face set, all the eyes <b>fixed</b> upon his <b>lips,</b> he began to shout a sort of catalogue of perfections: [...] "Generous, valorous, affable, profound"--(he snatched off his hat enthusiastically)--"a statesman, an invincible chief of partisans--" [...] He dropped his voice startlingly to a deep, hollow note--"and a dentist." ...|$|R
60|$|His {{excitement}} was at {{fever pitch}} now. He was leaning forward, and his attitude {{was one of}} burning expectancy. His hollow eyes were <b>fixed</b> upon Jan's <b>lips</b> as if they would extract from them the glad news which they held. Whatever weakness there was in Stoutenburg's nature, one thing in him was strong--and that was hatred. He could hate with an intensity of passion worthy of a fine cause. He hated the Stadtholder first, and secondly the nameless adventurer who had humiliated him and forced him to lick the dust: wounded in his vanity and in his arrogance he was consumed with an inordinate desire for revenge. The hope that this revenge was now at last in sight--that the man whom he hated so desperately was now in his power--almost caused the light of mania to dance in his glowing eyes.|$|R
6000|$|As he was {{dressing}} for dinner his eye fell on a card announcing the [...] "at home" [...] {{of one of}} his own cousins. Her husband was a composer, and he had a vague idea that he would find at the house of a composer some quite unusually free kind of atmosphere. After dining at the club, therefore, he set out for Chelsea. The party was held in a large room on the ground-floor, which was already crowded with people when Shelton entered. They stood or sat about in groups with smiles <b>fixed</b> on their <b>lips,</b> and the light from balloon-like lamps fell in patches on their heads and hands and shoulders. Someone had just finished rendering on the piano a composition of his own. An expert could at once have picked out from amongst the applauding company those who were musicians by profession, for their eyes sparkled, and a certain acidity pervaded their enthusiasm. This freemasonry of professional intolerance flew {{from one to the other}} like a breath of unanimity, and the faint shrugging of shoulders was as harmonious as though one of the high windows had been opened suddenly, admitting a draught of chill May air.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The lack {{of certain}} {{essential}} polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) induces perturbation in cell proliferation, apoptosis and dedifferentiation {{that could be}} linked to an increased protumorigenic trend.

After weaning, BALB/c mice were assigned to four diets: Control (C), Corn Oil (CO), Fish (FO) and Olein (O). Two weeks later, DMBA was injected into the submandibular area.

60|$|It {{was late}} the next {{afternoon}} when I rode through the canada {{that led to the}} rancho. I confess my thoughts were somewhat gloomy, in spite of my escape from the noisy hotel; but this was due to the sombre scenery through which I had just ridden, and the monotonous russet of the leagues of wild oats. As I approached the rancho, I saw that Enriquez had made no attempt to modernize the old casa, and that even the garden was left in its lawless native luxuriance, while the rude tiled sheds near the walled corral contained the old farming implements, unchanged for a century, even to the ox-carts, the wheels of which were made of a single block of wood. A few peons, in striped shirts and velvet jackets, were sunning themselves against a wall, and near them hung a half-drained pellejo, or goatskin water-bag. The air of absolute shiftlessness must have been repellent to Mrs. Saltillo's orderly precision, and for a moment I pitied her. But it was equally inconsistent with Enriquez's enthusiastic ideas of American progress, and the extravagant designs he had often imparted to me of the improvements he would make when he had a fortune. I was feeling uneasy again, when I suddenly heard the rapid clack of unshod hoofs on a rocky trail that joined my own. At the same instant a horseman dashed past me at full speed. I had barely time to swerve my own horse aside to avoid a collision, yet in that brief moment I recognized the figure of Enriquez. But his face I should have scarcely known. It was hard and <b>fixed.</b> His upper <b>lip</b> and thin, penciled mustache were drawn up over his teeth, which were like a white gash in his dark face. He turned into the courtyard of the rancho. I put spurs to my horse, and followed, in nervous expectation. He turned in his saddle as I entered. But the next moment he bounded from his horse, and, before I could dismount, flew to my side and absolutely lifted me from the saddle to embrace me. It was the old Enriquez again; his face seemed to have utterly changed in that brief moment.|$|R
