50|$|The {{earliest}} {{person to}} explore philosophical questions regarding film was Hugo Münsterberg.

50|$|Her Defiance was {{extremely}} notable for Madison’s use of “matting,” a process she desired to signify time and distance passing {{in the short}} silent film. The matte process is a very old technique, {{dating back to the}} late 1890s. It is used in photography and special effects filmmaking combining various images into a single image. Madison uses this in her final scene when Adeline and Frank are speaking. On one side Frank is confessing truths about his life and his behaviors, while on the other side Adeline is <b>flash-backing</b> to memories of the couple together in different events.|$|R
5000|$|International Business Times {{wrote that}} the film [...] "fails to come out as a comedy {{suspense}} thriller as {{it was supposed to}} be".

50|$|The {{film has}} a {{non-linear}} construction with frequent <b>flash-backs</b> and flash-forwards (especially {{at the beginning}} of the film.)

50|$|His first self-produced {{film was}} The Embryo Hunts In Secret (extra=1966), {{a story of}} a man who kidnaps, tortures and sexually abuses a woman until she finally escapes and stabs him to death. Freeze-frames, <b>flash-backs,</b> {{hand-held}} camera and locations limited to two rooms and a hallway add to the film's disturbing, claustrophobic atmosphere. Vagabond of Sex (1967) was a parody of Imamura's A Man Vanishes (1967). In Wakamatsu's film, a man leaves his family in Tokyo to travel and engage in various sexual escapades. When he returns home he finds out that his wife is starring in Imamura's documentary about her search for her missing husband.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reviewer}} in The New York Times {{called the}} film [...] "a manful effort to extol the martial virtues and {{to defend the}} Academy against its detractors." [...] The reviewer continues: Ladd's performance is unrelievedly granite-jawed, but {{under the influence of}} Academy discipline, the granite is highly polished. Donna Reed, his leading woman, is creditably restrained in her depiction of a war widow. Coulouris' attack on Ladd and West Point is so unnecessarily malignant that one might almost suspect him of being an Annapolis man. As director, John Farrow has sometimes underlined the emotional content of the scenario unduly, but his technique of integrating <b>flash-backs</b> and present action is masterfully smooth.|$|R

5000|$|Warren Ellis {{introduced}} the character shortly after taking over writing duties on the Stormwatch title, {{when he had}} Apollo and Midnighter encounter the then-active Stormwatch team. The story was set in 1998, immediately after Bendix's fall, when Christine Trelane had cracked Bendix's old files and discovered evidence that two rogue former Bendix agents remained alive. In <b>flash-backs,</b> Apollo was introduced {{as a member of}} a [...] "black ops" [...] Stormwatch team so secret that no-one but the first Weatherman, Henry Bendix, knew of its existence. Apollo's solar-powered abilities - including super-strength, heat vision, and a high degree of invulnerability - were presented as the consequence of Bendix's bioengineering.|$|R
40|$|A Silence That Never Was, a {{large-scale}} solo exhibition, included some 250 individual works composed as a multiple-piece installation. See [URL] and [URL] The exhibition was reviewed in Peel Magazine: [URL] The research installation {{built up a}} series of cross-associations between different creative genres, historic traditions and theoretical themes. A central narrative was built up from a series of some 150 A 3 photographs overworked with paint and drawing. These formed a linear development like a series of film noir stills. A Silence That Never Was thus explored ideas derived form 20 th century film and literature (the use of multiple overlapping narratives, cross-associational poetics, alter ego personas, <b>flash-backs</b> and dream sequences, juxtapositions of factual documentary and fictional reverie) ...|$|R
50|$|In 1992, {{he began}} {{referring}} to his division of canvas as Introspective Naturalism to describe {{the representation of the}} inner and outer world, with the outer world in a realistic manner placed {{in the center of the}} paintings’ surface and the inner world as an abstract expression on the edges of the painting’s surface. He wrote, “Any type of perception of the external world to the limit of our body is always mixed with the reality which is kept in our inner self: the state of mind, memories, drowsiness, wakefulness, lived images, excitement after a discussion, sun blinding effect which makes immediate after images like photonegatives, <b>flash-backs,</b> experience of cold or extreme heat, etc…”.|$|R
