40|$|Objectives: Septic syndromes are {{the leading}} cause of death in {{intensive}} care units. They are characterized by the development of immune dysfunctions such as endotoxin tolerance (ET), whose intensity and duration are associated with increased risk of nosocomial infections and mortality. Alarmins S 100 A 8 and S 100 A 9 have been shown to be increased after septic shock. Importantly, a delayed S 100 A 9 mRNA increase predicts hospital-acquired infection in patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of S 100 A 8 and S 100 A 9 mRNA expression in an ex vivo model of ET. Subjects and Measurements: ET was reproduced ex vivo by priming healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (number of donors = 9 to 10) with low-dose endotoxin (2 ng/ml) before stimulation with high dose endotoxin (100 ng/ml). S 100 A 8 and S 100 A 9 mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions. Main Results: ET was established by observing decreased TNFa and increased IL- 10 transcriptomic responses to two subsequent endotoxin challenges. Interestingly, ET was associated with increased S 100 A 8 and S 100 A 9 mRNA expression ex vivo. We showed that IL- 10 played a role in this process, since S 100 A 8 and S 100 A 9 mRNA increases were significantly abrogated by IL- 10 blockade in the model. Conversely, treatment with rIFN-c, a pro-inflammatory and <b>immunostimulating</b> <b>molecule</b> known to block ET induction, was able to restore normal S 100 A 8 and S 100 A 9 mRNA in this model. Conclusions: In this ex vivo model, we observed that S 100 A 8 and S 100 A 9 mRNA expression was significantly increase...|$|E

We showed that IL- 10 played a role in this process, since S 100 A 8 and S 100 A 9 mRNA increases were significantly abrogated by IL- 10 blockade in the model. Conversely, treatment with rIFN-γ, a pro-inflammatory and <b>immunostimulating</b> <b>molecule</b> known to block ET induction, was able to restore normal S 100 A 8 and S 100 A 9 mRNA in this model. In this ex vivo model, we observed that S 100 A 8 and S 100 A 9 mRNA expression was significantly increased during ET. This reproduced ex vivo the observations we had previously made in septic shock patients. Interestingly, IL- 10 blockade and rIFN-γ treatment partially abrogated S 100 A 8 /A 9 mRNA increases in this model. Pending confirmation in larger, independent clinical studies, these preliminary results suggest that S 100 A 8 and S 100 A 9 mRNA levels might be used as surrogate markers of ET and as stratification tools for personalized immunotherapy in septic shock patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} {{knowledge about}} immunological concepts and systems nowadays helps to rationally enhance the performance of, and to overcome {{some of the}} problems, {{that are associated with}} inactivated vaccines. Because the antigenic component of an inactivated vaccine by itself only gives a limited or no activation of the immune system, the addition of an adjuvant is required to induce a strong and an adequate type of immune response. However, this may be associated with unacceptable local reactions. To overcome this safety issue and to further enhance the performance of "first-generation" adjuvants, research is currently addressing new types of adjuvants that are both safe and strong. A solution for the generation of safe and strong adjuvants without unwanted, or minimal, local reactions can be found within the use of the so-called host-derived <b>immunostimulating</b> or modulating <b>molecules,</b> e. g., intercellular signaling molecules like cytokines and cell traffic-directing chemokines. As these molecules are host derived, and therefore often species specific, they have been shown to induce highly acceptable local reactions (if any) in contrast to many "first-generation" adjuvants. Proper efficacy of these molecular adjuvants requires optimal dosing and timing...|$|R
