40|$|The cost {{of several}} circuit {{configurations}} for large (5 MW) array fields were investigated {{to assess the}} relative costs {{of high and low}} voltage configurations. Three source circuit NOC voltages were evaluated: 400 V (ungrounded), 800 V (+ or 400 V center grounded), and 2000 V (+ or - 1000 V center grounded). Four source circuit configurations were considered {{for each of the three}} NOC voltages. The configurations correspond to source circuit currents of 15, 30, 45, and 60 amperes, respectively. Conceptual layouts for 5 MW building blocks for each of the above configurations were developed. The designs were optimized to minimize BOS electrical and structural costs. Only the BOS electrical costs were evaluated. The designs were broken down into the following elements for cost: (1) basic source circuit intermodule wiring, bypass diodes and associated hardware, source circuit to J-Box wiring, etc; (2) J-Box blocking diodes, varistors, heat sinks, and housing; (3) disconnects source circuit disconnects, fuses, and housing; (4) bus cabling J-Box to PCU <b>interface</b> <b>wiring,</b> and trenching; (5) interface bus bar, group disconnects, and fuses; and (6) fault detection shunts, signal wire, electronics, and alarm.

40|$|A {{control system}} using a low-drift power-feedback signal was {{implemented}} applying thermal waves, giving a sensor output independent of resistance drift and thermo-electric offset voltages on <b>interface</b> <b>wires.</b> Kelvin-contact sensing and power control {{is used on}} heater resistors, thereby inhibiting the influence of heater resistance drift. The thermal waves are detected with a sensing resistor using a lock-in amplifier and are mutually cancelled by a thermal-wave balancing controller. Offset due to thermal gradient across the chip and resistor drift are eliminated by the lock-in amplifier and power controller, and therefore do not influence the sensor output signal. A microchannel thermal-wave balancing flow sensor with integrated Al resistors has successfully been fabricated. The thermal flow sensor is capable of measuring water flow rates with nl· min− 1 precision, up to about 500 nl· min− 1 full scale. Measurement results are in good agreement with a dynamic model of the flow sensor.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{constructing}} prerouted FPGA cores, which lays {{the foundations for}} a rapid system construction framework for dynamically reconfigurable computing systems, is presented. Two major challenges are considered: how to manage the wires crossing a core’s borders; and how to maintain an acceptable level of flexibility for system construction with only a minimum of overhead. In order to maintain FPGA computing performance, {{it is crucial to}} thoroughly analyze the issues at the lowest level of device detail {{in order to ensure that}} computing circuit encapsulation is as efficient as possible. We present the first methodology that allows a core to scale its interface bandwidth to the maximum available in a routing channel. Cores can be constructed independently from the rest of the system using a framework that is independent of the method used to place and route primitive components within the core. We use an abstract FPGA model and CAD tools that mirror those used in industry. An academic design flow has been modified to include a wire policy and an interface constraints framework that tightly constrains the use of the wires that cross a core’s boundaries. Using this tool set we investigate the effect of prerouting on overall system optimality. Abutting cores are instantly connected by colocation of <b>interface</b> <b>wires.</b> Eliminating run-time routing drastically reduces the time taken to construct a system using a set of cores...|$|R
