Andrei manages to sneak <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment,</b> and watches how, while still talking to Giani, Marilena cuts her jugular vein. After realizing what had happened, Giani becomes frightened and runs away; the pimp sees him leaving in a rush, so {{he goes to the}} apartment to see what happened. Meanwhile, Andrei goes into the room and looks down at Marilena who is lying down, with blood spilled over her. The news about Marilena's suicide spread fast around the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Prairie Village home {{purchase}} fell through, however, the couple's Missouri home caught fire while {{the family was}} out. Insurance investigators later determined that the fire was caused by an electrical short in a power cord. Though the house was reparable and the couple's home insurance paid out on the damage and lost property, the couple decided to move on, and Green and the children moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> in which Farrar had been living during the separation while {{the purchase of the}} Prairie Village home was re-negotiated.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Chris takes {{a shotgun}} from his father-in-law's home and carries {{it to his}} office in a tennis bag. On leaving, he calls Nola on her mobile to tell her he has good news for her. He goes to Nola's {{building}} and gains entry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> of her neighbor, Mrs. Eastby, who he shoots and kills and then stages a burglary by ransacking the rooms and stealing jewelry and drugs. As Nola returns he shoots her in the stairwell. Chris then takes a taxi to the theater to watch a musical with Chloe. Scotland Yard investigates the crime and concludes it was committed by a drug addict stealing money. The following day, as the murder is in the news, Chris returns the shotgun and he and Chloe announce that she is pregnant.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} group of mob members {{plotting}} a scheme whilst Hauer is seen drinking an unspecified alcohol. Subsequently, the song starts and Minogue is seen on a diving board, jumping into a pool, presumably dead. Mob members look towards her body in distance, but then look away towards Hauer. She starts singing the track in the pool, gets out of it, and walks towards the mob members who seem disinterested of her presence. The singer undresses herself and throws the dress out of the window, which captures their attention. She subsequently drives in a limousine and puts on accessories whilst the driver takes her to a casino. The artist enters a large room, and plays poker with several members, eventually winning. Minogue appears in the limousine again, sporting the blue cocktail dress. Hauer, who is by himself at home, hears Minogue walking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment,</b> but she pushes over a large green vase and smashes it; disinterested, he looks towards in distance. The final scene has Minogue undressing herself and walking down steps.|$|E

25|$|The {{circumstances}} surrounding Serpico's shooting quickly came into question. Serpico, who was armed during the drug raid, {{had been shot}} only after briefly {{turning away from the}} suspect when he realized that the two officers who had accompanied him to the scene were not following him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment,</b> raising the question whether Serpico had actually been brought to the apartment by his colleagues to be murdered. There was no formal investigation.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Jones and Rosario had {{been marked by}} domestic violence, and eventually she ended it and he moved out. However, he had in early July 2012 twice attempted to break <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment,</b> even after Rosario changed the locks. Hedgepeth drove her roommate to court to get a protective order that required Jones {{to stay away from}} the apartment. Jones reportedly resented Hedgepeth's influence over his former girlfriend, and at one point reportedly threatened during a phone conversation with Hedgepeth to kill her if he could not get back together with Rosario.|$|E
60|$|I put my basin on a tray, {{and went}} myself to fetch some more milk. With great grumblings, the fellow rose, and preceded {{me in my}} ascent: we mounted to the garrets; he opened a door, now and then, to look <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartments</b> we passed.|$|R
60|$|He had not ventured on {{bringing}} <b>the</b> letter <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartments,</b> but he repeated {{most of the}} substance of it, without, however, greatly raising the hopes of the Queen, though she was gratified that her cause was not neglected either by her son or by her brother-in-law.|$|R
60|$|Even {{the repairs}} thus made were but of {{transient}} benefit, for the roof being left in its dilapidated state, the rain soon penetrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartments</b> which Lord Byron had restored and decorated, {{and in a}} few years rendered them almost as desolate {{as the rest of the}} Abbey.|$|R
25|$|By now {{the murders}} had {{attracted}} widespread media attention and many students were taking extra precautions, such as changing their daily routines and sleeping together in groups. Because the spree was happening {{so early in}} the fall semester, some students withdrew their enrollment or transferred to other schools. Twenty-three year old Tracy Paules was living with Manny Taboada, also 23, her burly 200lb roommate. On Monday, August 27, Rolling broke <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> by prying open the sliding glass door with the same tools he had used previously. Rolling found Taboada asleep in one of the bedrooms and, after a struggle with the young man, eventually killed him.|$|E
25|$|Born August 26, 1990 {{and named}} after his hated father {{who left the}} family, Tory is an asocial self-proclaimed genius with a {{photographic}} memory, adept at playing arcade games. So unchallenged by academics that he resorts to other means of exhausting his energy, he is overly obsessive when something or someone catches his interest, and keeps tabs on every event he deems significant in his life, recording the exact time (down to the minute or second) and place in which they occur. When Colin moves <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> across the street, he instantly becomes hooked on tracking his every move. He chases after Colin, blinding himself {{with the prospect of}} uncovering his secrets; he is unwilling to admit to himself the circumstances surrounding his feelings towards the other boy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of Friday, August 24, Rolling broke <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> shared by 17-year-old {{university}} freshmen Sonja Larson and Christina Powell. Finding Powell asleep on the downstairs couch, he stood over her briefly but did not wake her up, choosing instead to explore the upstairs bedroom where he found Larson also asleep. Rolling murdered Larson, first taping her mouth shut to stifle her screams and then stabbing her to death. She died while trying to fend him off. Rolling then went back downstairs, taped Powell's mouth shut, bound her wrists together behind her back and threatened her with a knife as he cut her clothes off of her. He then raped her and forced her face-down onto the floor, where he stabbed her five times in the back. Rolling posed the bodies in sexually provocative positions and left the apartment.|$|E
60|$|A stout {{band of the}} Constable's spearmen {{guarded the}} gate of the nunnery, admitting within the hallowed precinct the few only who were to be present at the solemnity, with their {{principal}} attendants, and while the former were ushered with all due ceremony <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartments</b> dressed out for the occasion, the attendants, although detained in the outer court, were liberally supplied with refreshments of the most substantial kind; and had the amusement, so dear to the menial classes, of examining and criticising their masters and mistresses, as they passed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> interior <b>apartments</b> prepared for their reception.|$|R
60|$|Ozma {{gave the}} Wizard back the piglet {{he had so}} kindly allowed Nick Chopper to {{substitute}} for the lost one, and then she carried her own <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartments</b> of <b>the</b> palace where she lived.

25|$|A day later, on Saturday, August 25, Rolling broke <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{apartment}}</b> where 18-year-old Christa Hoyt {{lived by}} prying open a {{sliding glass door}} with a KA-BAR knife and a screwdriver, {{but she was not}} home. He waited in the living room for her to return. At 11 a.m. she entered the apartment and Rolling surprised her from behind, placing her in a choke-hold. After she had been subdued, he taped her mouth shut, bound her wrists together and led her into the bedroom, where he cut the clothes from her body and raped her. As in the Powell murder, he forced her face-down and stabbed her in the back, rupturing her heart. He then decapitated the body and posed her head on a shelf facing the corpse, adding to the shock of whoever discovered her.|$|E
25|$|Born November 18, 1989 in South Africa to a British {{father and}} British Chinese mother, Colin is an {{extremely}} quiet, mysterious, and cold boy who moves <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> (346 68th St., Woodridge, Queens, New York) {{across the street from}} Tory, Saturday September 25, 2004, between 12:14 AM and 1:25 AM. His success in school is mediocre despite study, and he often skips classes, adding to his already poor reputation among teachers and students alike. He lives a secluded life, only leaving his home to go to church and to travel. He suffers from an ailment that causes intense coughing and shivering {{that may or may not}} be related to his involvement in the Gaia Project. Though he rejects Tory and Mandy's attempts to help him during a relapse of his condition, he eventually becomes close friends with the two during their peer tutoring sessions. He owns approximately seven cats.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, the U.S. federal {{government}} passed the Fair Housing Act, which, under most circumstances, prohibits any policy that excludes {{families with children}} from living in an apartment complex. The passage of the actwhich forced the complexes to admit childrenand a rental market recession, caused a decrease in rent prices and {{a shift in the}} area's demographics throughout the 1990s. Immigrants and refugees from Mexico, Central America, Bosnia, Burma, Bhutan, and parts of Africa moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> complexes. The infrastructure that existed was largely not designed for families. The Vickery Meadow Improvement District, a coalition of fifty area organizations, opened in 1993 {{to improve the quality of}} life of area residents and stabilize the area real property and real property investments. In 2004, Casie Pierce, the executive director of the Vickery Meadow Public Improvement District, argued in an editorial in The Dallas Morning News that Vickery Meadow ought to be redeveloped into modern urban renewal.|$|E
25|$|Odor {{problems}} in <b>the</b> <b>apartments</b> produced serious objections amongst residents. Designing a properly working ventilation system for an extensive network of piping (urine pipes, ventilation pipes, fecal chutes) and accounting for {{factors such as}} high winds, open bathroom windows, and kitchen exhaust fans, required relatively complex engineering. Frozen ventilation pipes during the extremely cold winters of 2007 and 2008 caused odors from the feces bins to back up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartments</b> contributing further to residents' displeasure.|$|R

25|$|Besieged by reporters, Ethan checks into a motel. He {{receives}} {{a letter from}} the killer, which leads to a shoebox containing a mobile phone, a handgun, and five origami figures. The killer calls him and explains that each of the figures contains instructions on how to complete a trial, which will allow him to determine how much Ethan loves his son. If he chooses to complete them, then he will receive a piece of the address where Shaun is held. The trials force Ethan to make increasingly difficult moral decisions, including driving against traffic at high speeds on the highway, crawling through a maze composed of broken glass and active electrical pylons, cutting off one of his fingers, breaking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> of a drug dealer and murdering him in front of his family, and drinking a glass of poison on camera. While undergoing the trials, he meets Madison Paige, a journalist who occasionally checks into the motel to deal with her chronic insomnia. She sympathizes with Ethan's plight, and decides to conduct her own investigation into the Origami Killer.|$|E
25|$|Politics again intervened at Munich in 1972, with lethal consequences. A Palestinian {{terrorist}} group named Black September invaded the Olympic village and broke <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> of the Israeli delegation. They killed two Israelis and held 9 others as hostages. The terrorists demanded that Israel release numerous prisoners. When the Israeli government refused their demand, a tense stand-off ensued while negotiations continued. Eventually the captors, still holding their hostages, were offered safe passage {{and taken to}} an airport, where they were ambushed by German security forces. In the firefight that followed, 15 people, including the nine Israeli athletes and five of the terrorists, were killed. After much debate, {{it was decided that}} the Games would continue, but proceedings were obviously dominated by these events. Some memorable athletic achievements did occur during these Games, notably the winning of a then-record seven gold medals by United States swimmer Mark Spitz, Lasse Virén (of Finland)'s back-to-back gold in the 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters (defeating American distance running great Steve Prefontaine in the former), and the winning of three gold medals by 16-year-old Soviet gymnastic sensation Olga Korbut - who thrilled the world with an historic backflip off the high bar. Korbut, however, failed to win the all-around, losing to her teammate Ludmilla Tourischeva.|$|E

25|$|The weekly Moskovskiye Novosti later {{reported}} that {{eight of the}} city's twenty ambulances had been destroyed by the mobs.
