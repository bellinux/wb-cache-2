We view verification as a programming problem in a sophisticated programming language and evaluate this approach by presenting a number of examples developed in the ALF system. Thereby we exploit the recent advantages in the presentation of Type Theory in particular by using pattern matching as proposed in [Coq 92]. 1 Introduction The steps {{in the development of}} a software system can be classified in exploration and consolidation. Exploratory steps are the implementation of a prototype or the experimental addition of new features to an existing system. Examples of consolidation are debugging, testing, extending and updating documentation, etc. One important objective of a good software development methodology is to support consolidation without making exploration too hard. We have to reject an anarchic approach to software <b>development</b> (<b>hacking)</b> because it ignores the need for consolida [...] ...|$|R

A greatly extended version was first released on Usenet in 1984 by Andries Brouwer. Brouwer continued to work on Hack until July 1985. Don Kneller ported the game to MS-DOS and continued development there. <b>Development</b> on all <b>Hack</b> versions ended within a few years. Hack descendant NetHack was released in 1987.|$|R

Both projects have teams of people, the brand credibility of their institutions, and graduate students to write papers about them and use them in research. Hackety Hack is a more nimble project, since the team is much smaller.

40|$|Abstract-In {{the world}} of Internet, {{security}} is the major concern to avoid fekes and forgeries. Internet does not use secure links, thus {{it is necessary to}} provide security measures against the most common attacks on web-applications. Since now a days all the transactions are done via Internet so it’s an urgent need to protect the data from malicious attacks. The purpose of this project is to develop a secure multi-factor authentication that would provide high security in their own web-applications. The risks of using static passwords to authenticate users show more and more security risks with the <b>development</b> of <b>hacking.</b> In this paper, we introduce a DCT based steganographic method for data hiding. The embedding approach is designed to satisfy three goals; maximizing the amount of hidden message, minimizing difference between the cover image and stego-image, and maximizing the robustness of embedding. This paper gives a solution to implement Multi-factor authentication. Keywords-Multi-factor Authentication,Single-Facto...|$|R
5000|$|The free {{software}} Canon <b>Hack</b> <b>Development</b> Kit (CHDK) project, started by Andrey Gratchev, has successfully enhanced many Canon PowerShot cameras without replacing the stock firmware. It allows programmatic control of many Canon compact cameras, enabling users to add features, including games and scripts written in UBASIC or Lua. Features include shooting in RAW, USB-cable remote shutter-release, synchronized shooting between multiple cameras, motion-detection triggered photography, customizable high-speed continuous (burst) TV, Av, ISO, and Focus bracketing (increasing depth of field), 1 Gig video-size limit removed in earlier cameras, Shutter, Aperture, and ISO overrides (shutter speeds of 64" [...] to 1/10,000" [...] and higher).|$|R
30|$|Stream {{length is}} a {{significant}} morphometric parameter of the basin as it reveals surface runoff nature. Streams that have relatively smaller lengths are characteristics of the steeper slope and finer texture of the area. The streams having comparatively long lengths are suggestive of flat topography with gentle gradients. According {{to the law of}} stream length (Horton 1945), the total length of stream segments is maximum in first-order streams and decreases as the stream order increases. The mean and total stream length of each stream order is given in Table  2. The relationship between stream length and basin area is characterized as the headward erosion is the predominant driver for the drainage network <b>development</b> and expansion (<b>Hack</b> 1957). The average stream length ratio is observed maximum 2.46 (SW- 4) and minimum 0.53 (SW- 3) (Table  2), suggestive of the control of rock types and structures in the development of drainage basin.|$|R

50|$|Following {{the success}} of the Canon <b>Hack</b> <b>Development</b> Kit (CHDK) for Canon's PowerShot cameras, third party {{firmware}} was also produced for the 5D Mark II. The Magic Lantern firmware provides many additional video and cinematography related controls and meters such as false colors, and zebra stripes for exposure control, depth of field estimates via peaking filters, audio VU meters and disables the automatic gain control on the microphone input (although some of these features have since been added to Canon's official firmware, as noted above). Recent nightly builds have even managed to provide a stable output of uncompressed 14-Bit RAW video data onto fast UDMA 7 CF cards at almost HD resolution (1004p vs. 1080p at Full HD). Although the size of the files and high price of appropriate cards are considered moderate drawbacks and the 5D Mark III generally shows better performance regarding RAW video, the Mark II, being the oldest among them, still remains to be the next best among reasonable choices for DSLR RAW video output and showcases thus, that uncompressed HD RAW video on a DSLR was already theoretically possible with technology of the year 2008.|$|R
500|$|Hack (1982) was {{developed}} by Jay Fenlason with help from Kenny Woodland, Mike Thome, and Jonathan Payne, students at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School at the time, while participating in the school's computer lab overseen by Brian Harvey. Harvey {{had been able to}} acquire a PDP-11/7 minicomputer for the school and instituted a course curriculum that allowed students to do whatever they wanted on the computers, including playing games, as long as they had completed assignments by the end of each semester. Fenlason, Woodland, Thome, and Payne met through these courses and became a close-group of friends and competent programmers. Harvey had invited the group to the computer labs at UC Berkeley where they had the opportunity to use the mainframe systems there, and were introduced to Rogue, inspiring them to create their own version as their class project. Fenlason had created a list of features they wanted to improve upon in Rogue such as having a level's layout saved once the player moved off that level. [...] They approached Toy and Arnold at a local USENIX conference for the source code to Rogue, but were refused, forcing them to develop the routines from scratch. The resulting program, Hack, stayed true to the original Dungeons and Dragons influences, and derived its name from being both a [...] "hack and slash" [...] game as well as a programming hack to recreate Rogue without having access to its source code. Fenlason was not able to include all the desired features, and his involvement in <b>Hacks</b> <b>development</b> concluded after the students had left the school. Fenlason had provided the source code to Hack to the USENIX conferences to be distributed on their digital tapes, from which it was later discovered and built upon through USENET newsgroups, porting it to various systems. Like Angband, the maintainership of the Hack code passed through several hands, and some variants were created by different forks.|$|R
