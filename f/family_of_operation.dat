40|$|Abstract. (Left) Bol loops {{are usually}} {{introduced}} as loops in which (left) Bol condition is satisfied, {{and the existence}} of the two-sided inverse of any element as well as the left inverse property are deduced. It appears that some of the assumptions on the structure are superflous and can be omitted, or modified. Also, Bol loops can be presented in various settings as far as the <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> symbols is concerned. First we give a short survey on main known results on identities of Bol-Moufang type in quasigroups, written in a unified notation, and try to employ only multiplication and left division for the equational theory of left Bol loops. Then we propose a rather non-traditional concept of the variety of left Bol loops in type (2, 1, 0), with operation symbols (·,− 1, e) and with five-element defining set of identities, namely xe = ex = x, (x− 1) − 1 = x, x− 1 (xy) = y, x(y(xz)) = (x(yx)) z...|$|E

40|$|A general {{principle}} for grammars for languages {{is that they}} must use finite means to produce the infinitely many structures of the languages. When the term production is understood algebraically, {{there are at least}} two notions of finiteness involved. Firstly in each set of structures each structure is generated, i. e., the result of finitely many applications of operators. Secondly, the set of operators as such is also finite. For algebraic theories, this is eo ipso the case. But there are linguistic frameworks that are not generating but rather licensing linguistic structures such as Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar or GB-Theory. Within these, structures are not generated. Rather only general properties of admissible structures are stated. But these structures must be provided somehow. Thus one may ask if there are algebraic approaches to licensing theories. We show here that HPSG is non-algebraic in the following sense. There is no finite <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> such that the members of every finite set of feature structures can be constructed by this finite <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations.</b> We also show that HPSG feature structures are abstractly recognisable in the sense that for every set of finite HPSG feature structures there exists a (manysorted) algebra with finite sort sets <b>of</b> infinitely many <b>operations</b> such that every feature structur...|$|R

In fact, GIS has several limitations in the domain of spatial decision-aid. The remedy to these limitations is to integrate GIS technology with OR/MS tools and especially with MCA. The long-term aim of such integration is to develop the so-called spatial decision support system (SDSS), which is devoted to help decision makers in spatial problems. Thus, a design of a SDSS is also presented in this paper...|$|R
