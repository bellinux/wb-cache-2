5|$|After {{working on}} every film since Prisoner of Azkaban, Double Negative {{was asked to}} provide visual <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> the final {{instalments}} of the story, in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Parts1 and 2. Working closely with the film's VFXSupervisor, TimBurke, the team was led by VFXSupervisor, David Vickery and VFXProducer Charlotte Loughlane.

5|$|Alex Weldon {{was hired}} to be {{supervisor}} of special <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> the film. Weldon was planning on retiring after 42years of effects work, but his wife urged him to take on Star Trek because she thought {{he did not have}} enough to do. When Weldon was hired, many of the effects had already been started or completed by Rugg; it was up to Weldon to complete more complex and higher-budgeted <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> the motion picture. The first step of preparation involved analyzing the script in the number, duration, and type of effects. Before costs could be determined and Weldon could shop for necessary items, he and {{the other members of the}} special effects team worked out all possibilities for pulling off the effects in a convincing manner.|$|E

30|$|The pO 2 {{decreased}} significantly {{during exercise}} and after {{exercise in the}} H trial (main <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> time, P[*]=[*] 0.002), whereas no changes were observed in the N trial. Consequently, the pO 2 remained significantly lower in the H trial during exercise and after exercise (interaction, P[*]=[*] 0.018; main <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> trial, P[*]<[*] 0.0001). The pCO 2 decreased significantly during exercise and after exercise in both trials (main <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> time, P[*]=[*] 0.002). Exercise-induced reductions in pCO 2 were significantly greater in the N trial during the post-exercise period (interaction, P[*]=[*] 0.861; main <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> trial, P[*]=[*] 0.002).|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the innovative visual <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> the film, Stokdyk created a miniature of a skyscraper section at 1:16 scale with New Deal Studios' Ian Hunter and David Sanger. Stokdyk chose to design the miniature instead of using computer-generated imagery so damage done to the building could be portrayed realistically and timely without guesswork involving computer models. In addition, to Sony Imageworks, Cafe FX provided visual <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> the crane disaster scene when Spider-Man rescues Gwen Stacy, as well as shots in the climactic battle.|$|E

5|$|Myst IV: Revelation is {{the fourth}} {{installment}} in the Myst video game series, developed and published by Ubisoft. Revelation was the first game in the series released on a DVD-ROM format; a multiple CD-ROM version was not produced {{as it would have}} taken twelve compact discs to fit the data. Like , Revelation combines pre-rendered graphics with digital video, but also features real-time 3D <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> added realism.|$|E
40|$|Integrated use of {{chemical}} fertilizers with organic matter can help for a sustainable and environmentally sound agriculture production in soils low in organic matter. A 3 years study with rice and wheat cropping pattern was conducted on a sandy loam soil at the Wheat Research Centre, Nashipur, Dinajpur, Bangladesh to investigate the direct, renewed and residual effect of organic manures in combination with chemical fertilizers on crop productivity and soil fertility. The experiment was laid out with nine treatments in a randomized complete block design. The treatments were: 1) absolute control (no fertilizers, no manures), 2) 100 % NPKSZn of recommended dose, 3) 75 % NPKSZn of recommended dose, 4) 75 % NPKSZn+ farm yard manure (FYM) applied in wheat (a direct <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> wheat and residual <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> rice), 5) 75 % NPKSZn+FYM applied in both wheat and rice (a renewed <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> both continuing crops), 6) 75 % NPKSZn+FYM applied in rice (a direct <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> rice and a residual <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> wheat), 7) 75 %NPKSZn+ poultry manure (PM) applied in wheat (a direct for wheat and a residual <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> rice), 8) 75 % NPKSZn+PM applied in both wheat and rice (a renewed effect), 9) 75 % NPKSZn+PM applied in rice (a direct <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> rice and a residual <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> wheat). The results indicated that a wheat yield-increasing trend was observed for the PM treatment both as direct and residual. However, a yield-declining trend was observed in the control. There was no definite wheat yield trend for the other treatments. No definite rice yield trend was observed irrespective the treatments. The results showed that organic manures had direct and residual effects on both rice and wheat yields, but the effect of PM was dominant. Plots with FYM plus 75 % NPKSZn produced equivalent yields as plots applied [...] ...|$|R
