40|$|AbstractKv 2. 1 {{channels}} {{exhibit a}} U-shaped voltage-dependence of inactivation that {{is thought to}} represent preferential inactivation from preopen closed states. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying so-called U-type inactivation are unknown. We have performed a cysteine scan of the S 3 -S 4 and S 5 -P-loop linkers and found sites that are important for U-type inactivation. In the S 5 -P-loop linker, U-type inactivation was preserved in all mutant channels except <b>E</b> <b>352</b> C. This mutation, but not <b>E</b> <b>352</b> Q, abolished closed-state inactivation while preserving open-state inactivation, resulting {{in a loss of}} the U-shaped voltage profile. The reducing agent DTT, as well as the C 232 V mutation in S 2, restored U-type inactivation to the <b>E</b> <b>352</b> C mutant, which suggests that residues 352 C and C 232 may interact to prevent U-type inactivation. The R 289 C mutation, in the S 3 -S 4 linker, also reduced U-type inactivation. In this case, DTT had little effect but application of MTSET restored wild-type-like U-type inactivation behavior, suggestive of the importance of charge at this site. Kinetic modeling suggests that the <b>E</b> <b>352</b> C and R 289 C inactivation phenotypes largely resulted from reductions in the rate constants for transitions from closed to inactivated states. The data indicate that specific residues within the S 3 -S 4 and S 5 -P-loop linkers may play important roles in Kv 2. 1  U-type inactivation...|$|E
40|$|The {{activation}} of caspases {{is the principal}} event in the execution of apoptosis. Initiator caspases are activated through an autocatalytic mechanism often involving dimerisation or oligomerisation. In Drosophila, the only initiator caspase DRONC, is tightly inhibited by DIAP 1 and removal of DIAP 1 permits {{activation of}} DRONC by the Drosophila Apaf- 1 -related killer, ARK. ARK is proposed to facilitate DRONC oligomerisation and autoprocessing at residue <b>E</b> <b>352.</b> This study examines whether autoprocessing of DRONC is required for its activation and for DRONC-mediated cell death. Using purified recombinant proteins, we show here that while DRONC autocleaves at residue <b>E</b> <b>352,</b> mutation of this site did not abolish enzyme activation, DRICE-induced cleavage of DRONC or DRONC-mediated activation of DRICE. We performed a detailed mutational analysis of DRONC cleavage sites and show that overexpression of DRONC cleavage mutants in Drosophila cells retain pro-apoptotic activity. Using an in vitro cell-free assay, we found ARK alone did not activate DRONC and demonstrate a requirement for an additional cytosolic factor in ARK-mediated DRONC activation. These results suggest that, similar to mammalian caspase- 2 and caspase- 9, the initial cleavage of DRONC is not essential for its activation and suggest a mechanism of ARK-mediated DRONC activation different from that proposed previously.

Currently, stock assessments in the Northeast Pacific are limited to the most important commercial species, little being known about the status of non-commercial species. Nevertheless, standardized bottom-trawl surveys conducted in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) and Gulf of Alaska (GoA), although primarily designed to assess commercial species, provide valuable information on the abundance, distribution, and mean weight of numerous taxa. Using a novel statistical approach and survey data for the years 1993 e 2003, we examined trends in catch per unit effort (cpue), frequency of occurrence, and mean weight of individuals for each taxon. Time trends were computed as the slope of a linear regression of each indicator on year, and were summarized separately for the eastern and western GoA and for the EBS.

Protonation of residues is suggested to {{play a key role}} in the process, and residues <b>E</b> 349, D <b>352</b> and <b>E</b> 362 are of particular interest because of their location within the membrane insertion unit TH 8 –TH 9. We have used various spectroscopic, computational and functional assays to characterize the properties of the T domain carrying the double mutation <b>E</b> 349 Q/D <b>352</b> N or the single mutation E 362 Q. Vesicle leakage measurements indicate that both mutants interact with the membrane under less acidic conditions than the wild-type. Thermal unfolding and fluorescence measurements, complemented with molecular dynamics simulations, suggest that the mutant E 362 Q is more susceptible to acid destabilization because of disruption of native intramolecular contacts. Fluorescence experiments show that removal of the charge in E 362 Q, and not in <b>E</b> 349 Q/D <b>352</b> N, is important for insertion of TH 8 –TH 9.

40|$|EAL domain {{proteins}} are {{the major}} phosphodiesterases for maintaining the cellular concentration of second-messenger cyclic di-GMP in bacteria. Given the pivotal roles of EAL domains in the regulation of many bacterial behaviors, the elucidation of their catalytic and regulatory mechanisms would contribute to the effort of deciphering the cyclic di-GMP signaling network. Here, we present data to show that RocR, an EAL domain protein that regulates the expression of virulence genes and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO- 1, catalyzes the hydrolysis of cyclic di-GMP by using a general base-catalyzed mechanism {{with the assistance of}} Mg 2 + ion. In addition to the five essential residues involved in Mg 2 + binding, we propose that the essential residue <b>E</b> <b>352</b> functions as a general base catalyst assisting the deprotonation of Mg 2 +-coordinated water to generate the nucleophilic hydroxide ion. The mutation of other conserved residues caused various degree of changes in the kcat or Km, leading us to propose their roles in residue positioning and substrate binding. With functions assigned to the conserved groups in the active site, we discuss the molecular basis for the lack of activity of some characterized EAL domain proteins and the possibility of predicting the phosphodiesterase activities for the vast number of EAL domains in bacterial genomes in light of the catalytic mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The PALB 2 (Partner and Localizer of BRCA 2) protein stabilizes and localizes the BRCA 2 protein at nuclear foci in {{response}} to DNA damage. Biallelic PALB 2 variants cause Fanconi anemia, a recessive inherited chromosomal instability syndrome, while rare monoallelic variants of PALB 2 have been proposed to confer two-fold increased predisposition to breast cancer. To investigate the role of PALB 2 germline mutations in predisposition to breast cancer in the Malaysian breast cancer patient population and to determine its clinical significance, a total of 1220 breast cancer patients treated at University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) from January 2003 to December 2010 were recruited into the Malaysia Breast Cancer Genetic Study (MyBrCa). We selected 155 high risk individuals with either (a) diagnosed ≤ 50 {{years old and had}} at least one first- or second-degree relatives with breast cancer; (b) diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer with the primary cancer at age 50 or below; (c) diagnosed with male breast cancer at any age; (d) affected with both breast and ovarian cancers; (e) affected with both breast and pancreatic cancers; or (f) diagnosed with breast cancer and had at least one first-degree relative with pancreatic cancer. Of these, 33 individuals were screened positive for BRCA deleterious mutations, while 122 individuals lacked aberrations in both BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes. These 122 BRCA-negative individuals were then tested for PALB 2 germline mutations. Further screening for nine PALB 2 mutations/variants was conducted in 874 Malaysian and 532 Singaporean breast cancer patients, and in 1342 healthy Malaysian and 541 healthy Singaporean women. In-silico prediction of the pathogenicity of missense variants were conducted using both SIFT and Polyphen- 2. Statistical analyses were performed to compare the characteristics of PALB 2 mutation carrier relative to BRCA 1, BRCA 2 and non-carrier. We discovered two PALB 2 deleterious mutations (STOP 358 and S 869 X), ten missense variants (P 249 L, T 300 I, iv I 309 V, <b>E</b> <b>352</b> Q, D 498 Y, H 553 Q, Q 559 R, L 763 F, A 1017 T and E 1018 D) and one synonymous variant (S 689 S) from the sequencing of 122 BRCA-negative individuals. Genotyping of Asian recurrent PALB 2 mutations detected an additional PALB 2 carrier (STOP 353) among the unselected breast cancer patients. Variants classification using both case-control study and in-silico predictions enabled the characterization of PALB 2 P 249 L, I 309 V, <b>E</b> <b>352</b> Q, D 498 Y and Q 559 R to be possibly benign while PALB 2 H 553 Q, T 300 I, L 763 F, A 1017 T and E 1018 D remain as unclassified variants.

40|$|Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4 α (HNF 4 α, NR 2 A 1) {{is central}} to {{hepatocyte}} and pancreatic β-cell functions. Along with retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), HNF 4 α belongs to the nuclear receptor subfamily 2 (NR 2), characterised by a conserved arginyl residue and a glutamate residue insert in helix 7 (H 7) of the ligand binding domain (LBD). Crystallographic studies indicate that R 348 and <b>E</b> <b>352</b> residues in RXRα H 7 are involved in charge-driven interactions that improve dimerisation. Consistent with these findings, we showed that removing the charge of the corresponding residues in HNF 4 α H 7, R 258 and E 262, impaired dimerisation in solution. Moreover, our results provide a new concept according to which helices of the HNF 4 α LBD dimerisation interface contribute differently to dimerisation required for DNA binding; unlike H 9 and H 10, H 7 {{is not involved in}} DNA binding. Substitutions of E 262 decreased the repression of HNF 4 α transcriptional activity by a dominant-negative HNF 4 α mutant, highlighting the importance of this residue for dimerisation in the cell context. The E 262 insert is crucial for HNF 4 α function since its deletion abolished HNF 4 α transcriptional activity and coactivator recruitment. The glutamate residue insert and the conserved arginyl residue in H 7 most probably represent a signature of the NR 2 subfamily of nuclear receptors...|$|E

40|$|Myocilin, {{expressed}} in the trabecular meshwork of the eye, {{has been linked to}} inherited primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). The biological function of myocilin is unknown, but mutant myocilin exhibits a gain-of-function mechanism, aggregating within the endoplasmic reticulum of human trabecular meshwork cells, causing cell stress and eventually apoptosis. After apoptosis occurs, the trabecular meshwork is compromised, leading to an increase in intraocular pressure, a symptom of glaucoma. In this thesis, I have expressed and purified the wild-type olfactomedin (OLF) domain and 24 reported disease-causing variants. I developed a facile thermal stability assay using differential scanning fluorimetry, which follows the unfolding of a protein through the fluorescence of a dye sensitive to hydrophobic regions of a protein. Also in this thesis I have determined melting temperatures for the wild-type and for each of the disease-causing mutants. I have tested the stability of the mutants in the presence of seven osmolytes, with sarcosine and trimethylamine-N-oxide restoring the melting temperature closest to wild-type. Additionally, I expressed and purified three reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (<b>E</b> <b>352</b> Q, E 396 D, K 398 R), which are considered benign variants. Variants were also compared by circular dichroism, revealing high b-sheet content and wild-type structure.

40|$|Analysis of {{two ways}} of {{approaching}} the classics, apparently different but with underlying aspects in common, respectively {{in the fields of}} literature and visual art. In his lyric O Reginella (Myricae 2, 1892) Giovanni Pascoli uses the techniques of the Hellenistic and Roman poets, contaminating his literary sources and reusing epic models to describe the humble life of his rural characters: adopting the role of Odysseus in Od. VI, and combining fragments from three different passages (vv. 25 - 30, 62 - 65, 154 - 159), he addresses his makaismos to a girl (a new Nausicaa) who has stretched out her white laundry in the meadows. The theme of "Reginella", born from his readings of Homer, often returns in his poetic works (poems, letters, handwritten notes) : he adapts it to different poetic characters, sometimes imaginary, sometimes inspired by the figures of his real life. If Pascoli highlights its literary sources with a purposed allusive technique, in his painting Der Kuss (1907 - 1908) Klimt at first sight seems to hide them: the canvas is, in my opinion, inspired by the hierogamy of Zeus and Hera in Iliad XIV 341 - 351, whose archetypal value also {{stems from the fact that}} this is the first erotic scene in Western literature. All the details described by Homer are present here: the gold cloud that surrounds the lovers, the golden dew falling from the sky, the flowery meadow below them. Even a detail often ignored or misunderstood - the edge of cliff on which the two lovers are almost hovering - can find a more convincing explanation: the Hieros Gamos of the divine couple takes place on the Gargaron, the highest peak of Mount Ida (Il. XIV 292 s. <b>e</b> <b>352).</b> The Homeric scene, which inspired many ancient and modern artists, is here reinterpreted according to the personal style of the artist, who was attracted - at this stage of its production (the so called golden period) - by the myths of Zeus' loves: in the same years he painted Danae (1907 - 1908), impregnated by Zeus turned into a golden rain, and in 1917 Leda, who was loved by Zeus in the form of a swan...|$|E

Blood samples were collected from P. vivax-infected Iranian patients during 2009 - 2010. Of 99 collected isolates, 37 were analyzed for almost the entire pvama- 1 gene using sequencing. The overall nucleotide diversity (π) was 0. 00826 ± 0. 0004 and the majority of polymorphic sites were identified in domain I (DI) of the pvama- 1 gene. Neutrality analysis using Tajima's D, Fu and Li's D* and F* and McDonald Kreitman tests showed a significant positive departure from neutral substitution patterns, indicating a possible balancing selection across the entire ectodomain and DI sequences of pvama- 1 gene.

Foram avaliadas a produção total (PTT), produção {{comercial}} (PCM) e os teores de nitrato na matéria fresca da raiz, caule e folhas da alface. Não foram verificados efeitos significativos do incremento dos níveis de N na solução sobre a PTT e PCM, sendo obtidos valores médios de 357, 3 <b>e</b> <b>352,</b> 5 g/planta, respectivamente. A elevação dos níveis de N em solução resultou em incrementos nos teores de nitrato em todas as partes da alface, obtendo-se na dose máxima teores de 659, 623 e 615 mg kg- 1 de matéria fresca, para raiz, caule e folhas, respectivamente. Os máximos teores foliares de nitrato obtidos se encontraram abaixo do limite de risco para saúde humana. Lettuce {{production in}} hydroponic system presents growing expansion in Brazil, but {{still there are}} problems of quality and risk of nitrate accumulation. This work was carried out to evaluate the lettuce production and nitrate accumulation in hydroponic system depending on the increasing levels of nitrogen in the nutrient solution. The experiment was conducted in greenhouse of the Universidade Federal da Paraíba, Brazil. The lettuce plants were grown in nutrient solution containing increasing levels of N (11, 13, 15, 17, 19 and 21 mmol L- 1) during a 25 -day period. An entirely randomized design with four replications was used. Plant total yield (PTT), plant commercial yield (PCM) and nitrate contents in the fresh matter of roots, stems and leaves of the lettuce were evaluated. There were no significant effects of increasing levels of N in nutrient solution on PTT and PCM, average values of 357. 3 and 352. 5 g/plant being observed, respectively. The increased levels of N in nutrient solution increased linearly nitrate content on all lettuce parts. The nitrate content reached 659, 623 and 615 mg/kg in the fresh matter of roots, stems and leaves, respectively, at the highest N level. Nevertheless, the maximum nitrate content observed in leaves was far below the risk level for human health...|$|E

MÉTODOS: Participaram do estudo 629 escolares entre 10 e 14 anos (277 meninos <b>e</b> <b>352</b> meninas), obtidos de duas escolas públicas e duas escolas privadas da região central do município. Foi utilizado o índice de massa {{corporal}} (IMC) para determinação de sobrepeso e obesidade. Os valores de Z escore para IMC, peso e estatura foram determinados de acordo com sexo e idade. Para obtenção dos valores de Z escore, utilizou-se o método LMS. A maturação sexual foi avaliada de acordo com planilha contendo 5 estágios de maturação sexual para cada sexo. Os indivíduos foram agrupados por tercis da idade de acordo com estágio e sexo. O 1 º tercil foi considerado como maturação sexual precoce; e o 2 º tercil, como grupo de referência. RESULTADOS: As meninas com maturação sexual precoce têm maiores valores de Z escore Peso (²=- 0, 21, p OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate the}} relationship between early sexual maturation and obesity among students aged 10 - 14 years {{from the city of}} Florianopolis. METHODS: A total of 629 students (277 males and 352 females) aged 10 - 14 years were included in the study. The sample was obtained from two private schools and two public schools in the city of Florianopolis. The body mass index (BMI) was used for determining overweight and obesity. The values of weight, height, and BMI Z score according to gender and age were determined. The LMS method was utilized to determine Z score values. Sexual maturation was evaluated by Tanner stages for both males and females. Subjects were grouped using age-adjusted tertiles for each Tanner stage and gender. Subjects in the first tertile were considered early maturing, while subjects in the second tertile were considered the reference group. RESULTS: Early maturing girls were heavier (²=- 0. 21, p< 0. 05), taller (²=- 0. 15, p< 0. 05) and had higher BMI values for age (²=- 0. 3, p< 0. 05) than girls of other groups. Early maturing boys were taller for age (²=- 0. 21, p< 0. 05) than boys of other groups. The prevalence of overweight including obesity of early maturing girls was higher than for the reference group (p= 0. 01). No association was found between overweight, including obesity, and early sexual maturation among boys (p= 0. 648). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study are similar to other studies that declare that early maturing girls present a higher prevalence of obesity than non-early maturing girls. The present study did not show any association for boys regarding early sexual maturation and obesity...|$|E

Os coeficientes de digestibilidade aparente da proteína da soja crua, extrusada, tostada e macerada foram determinadas usando óxido de cromo (0, 5 %) como marcador. Foi elaborada dieta de referência com 26 % de proteína bruta <b>e</b> 4. <b>352</b> kcal kg - 1, e a cada alimento avaliado foram substituídas 30 % da dieta-teste. As fezes foram coletadas por pressão abdominal. Todos os produtos analisados apresentaram fatores antinutricionais, mas foi observada menor atividade de inibidor de tripsina no farelo de soja. Sojas que receberam tratamento térmico apresentaram os melhores coeficientes de digestibilidade e menores valores de atividade hemaglutinante do que a soja crua. Não foram observados efeitos dos inibidores de tripsina e taninos sobre o coeficiente de digestibilidade da proteína, mas foi observada relação negativa entre os teores de hemaglutinina com a digestibilidade da proteína bruta. Para a alimentação do pacu recomenda-se a utilização do farelo de soja e da soja processada por extrusão ou tostada. This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the activities of trypsin inhibitors, hemagglutinant and tannin levels in soybean meal and in raw and processed soy, as well evaluate the protein apparent digestibility coefficient for pacu juveniles. The apparent coefficients of raw, extruded, toasted and milled soy were determined using chromium oxide (0. 5 %) as marker. A reference diet was created with 26 % crude protein and 4, 352 kcal kg - 1, with each feed containing 30 % of the test diet. Feces were collected by abdominal pressure. All analyzed products presented anti-nutritional factors, but the lowest trypsin inhibitor activity was observed in soybean meal. Soy that received thermal treatment presented better digestibility coefficients and lower hemagglutinating activity values than raw soy. No effects of trypsin and tannin inhibitor were observed on the protein digestibility coefficient, but a negative relationship was observed between hemagglutinin levels and protein digestibility coefficient.

40|$|We {{report the}} result of a search for the {{infrared}} counterparts of 37 planetary nebulae (PNs) and PN candidates in the Spitzer Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire II (GLIMPSE II) survey. The photometry and images of these PNs at 3. 6, 4. 5, 5. 8, 8. 0, and 24 mum, taken through the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) and the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS), are presented. Most of these nebulae are very red and compact in the IRAC bands, and are found to be bright and extended in the 24 mum band. The infrared morphology of these objects are compared with Ha images of the Macquarie-AAO-Strasbourg (MASH) and MASH II PNs. The implications for morphological difference in different wavelengths are discussed. The IRAC data allow us to differentiate between PNs and HII regions and be able to reject non-PNs from the optical catalogue (<b>e.</b> g., PNG <b>352.</b> 1 - 00. 0). Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are constructed by combing the IRAC and MIPS data with existing near-, mid-, and far-IR photometry measurements. The anomalous colors of some objects allow us to infer the presence of aromatic emission bands. These multi-wavelength data provide useful insights into the nature of different nebular components contributing to the infrared emission of PNs.

Os alimentos testados foram farinha de vísceras de aves, farinha de penas, farinha de penas e vísceras e farelo de soja, os quais substituíram 30 % da dieta referência. Foi utilizado o método de colheita total de excretas, com 250 codornas, machos, em dois diferentes períodos de crescimento (20 a 25 e 35 a 40 dias de idade). O delineamento {{experimental}} utilizado foi o inteiramente casualizado, em esquema fatorial 4 x 2 (4 alimentos x 2 períodos) com cinco repetições por tratamento, de dez aves cada. Ocorreram variações quanto à composição química dos alimentos protéicos testados neste experimento, em relação aos valores citados na literatura. Os valores encontrados de energia metabolizável aparente e energia metabolizável aparente corrigida pelo balanço de nitrogênio em kcal/kg de alimento foram, respectivamente: farinha de vísceras de aves: 2. 609 e 2. 329 na primeira idade, e 2. 735 e 2. 664 na segunda idade; farinha de penas: 2. 551 e 2. 401 na primeira idade, e 2. 744 e 2. 641 na segunda idade; farinha de penas <b>e</b> vísceras: 2. <b>352</b> <b>e</b> 2. 155 na primeira idade, e 2. 500 e 2. 434 na segunda idade; farelo de soja: 2. 248 e 2. 046 na primeira idade, e 2. 294 e 2. 249 na segunda idade. Não houve influência da idade sobre os valores de energia metabolizável aparente, entretanto a idade influenciou os valores de energia metabolizável aparente corrigida pelo balanço de nitrogênio dos alimentos analisados. Four proteic feeds {{chemical composition}} were evaluated, {{as well as}} the age effect in meat quails on the values of apparent metabolizable energy (AME) and the apparent corrected by the nitrogen balance (AMEn). The feeds tested were poultry by-product meal, feather meal, poultry by-product meal and feather meal and soybean meal, which have substituted 30 % of the reference diet. It was utilized the total excrement collection, with 250 quails, males, in two different growth stages (20 to 25 and 35 to 40 days old). The experimental delineation utilized was the completely casual, in factorial scheme 4 x 2 (4 feeds x 2 periods) with 5 replicates per treatment, of 10 quails each one. Variation occurred referring to the chemical composition of the proteic feeds tested at this experiment, related to the cited values in the literature. The energy values found of apparent metabolizable energy and the apparent metabolizable energy corrected by the nitrogen balance in kcal/kg of feed were, respectively: poultry by-product meal: 2. 609 and 2. 329 at the first age, and 2. 735 and 2. 664 at the second age; feather meal: 2. 551 and 2. 401 at the first age, and 2. 744 and 2. 641 at the second age; poultry by-product meal and feather meal: 2. 352 and 2. 155 at the first age, and 2. 500 and 2. 434 at the second age; soybean meal: 2. 248 and 2. 046 at the first age, and 2. 294 and 2. 249 at the second age.

40|$|Many {{different}} {{ion channel}} pores {{are thought to}} have charged amino acid residues clustered around their entrances. The so-called surface charges contributed by these residues can play important roles in attracting oppositely charged ions from the bulk solution {{on one side of the}} membrane, increasing effective local counterion concentration and favoring rapid ion movement through the channel. Here we use site-directed mutagenesis to identify arginine residues contributing important surface charges in the intracellular mouth of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl− channel pore. While wild-type CFTR was associated with a linear current–voltage relationship with symmetrical solutions, strong outward rectification was observed after mutagenesis of two arginine residues (R 303 and R 352) located near the intracellular ends of the fifth and sixth transmembrane regions. Current rectification was dependent on the charge present at these positions, consistent with an electrostatic effect. Furthermore, mutagenesis-induced rectification was more pronounced at lower Cl− concentrations, suggesting that these mutants had a reduced ability to concentrate Cl− ions near the inner pore mouth. R 303 and R 352 mutants exhibited reduced single channel conductance, especially at negative membrane potentials, that was dependent on the charge of the amino acid residue present at these positions. However, the very low conductance of both R 303 <b>E</b> and R <b>352</b> E-CFTR could be greatly increased by elevating intracellular Cl− concentration. Modification of an introduced cysteine residue at position 303 by charged methanethiosulfonate reagents reproduced charge-dependent effects on current rectification. Mutagenesis of arginine residues in the second and tenth transmembrane regions also altered channel permeation properties, however these effects were not consistent with changes in channel surface charges. These results suggest that positively charged arginine residues act to concentrate Cl− ions at the inner mouth of the CFTR pore, and that this contributes to maximization of the rate of Cl− ion permeation through the pore...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceGrain Science and IndustryGreg AldrichProcessing {{pet food}} can be beneficial, {{but can also}} have adverse effects on {{shelf-life}} and nutrient survival. Most affected are supplemental vitamins and essential fatty acids (EFA). Pet food complicates this relative to human foods by combining all elements into the product before processing and requiring an extensive shelf-life (up to 2 years). The objective {{of this research was}} {{to determine the effects of}} processing, diet, and storage conditions on vitamin (vitamin A, vitamin D₃, vitamin E, folic acid and thiamine) and omega- 3 fatty acid (with an emphasis on eicosapentaenoic acid; EPA 20 : 5 n 3, and docosahexaenoic acid; DHA; 22 : 6 n 3) retention. The research was conducted in two separate experiments. Each experimental diet was produced on a single-screw extruder and triple-pass dryer. Target nutrients were evaluated in premixes in tandem to extruded diets. The vitamin study was conducted as a 3 X 2 X 2 factorial arrangement of treatments with 3 levels of dietary crude protein (CP), 2 screw speeds in the extruder, and 2 levels of time X temperature combinations in the dryer. Vitamins were added at 10 times normal levels to aid in analysis. The EFA study was conducted as a 3 X 3 factorial arrangement of treatments with 3 levels of dietary protein and 3 different omega- 3 sources: fish oil, fish meal, or purpose-grown algae rich in DHA. In the vitamin premix study, the quantity of vitamins declined by approximately 50 % over 6 months storage in ambient conditions (AMB; 20 C, 50 %RH), and all except folic acid were lost to some degree in stressed shelf life testing (SSLT; 50 C, 70 % RH) over 6 weeks. In all cases, the concentration of vitamins in food exiting the extruder and dryer were lower than target levels. As CP increased, the retention was higher (P ≤ 0. 05) for vitamins A, E, and folic acid off the extruder (<b>e.</b> g. 225, <b>352</b> vs. 219, 184 and 206, 249 IU/kg of vitamin A for high vs. medium and low CP, respectively), and vitamin D₃, E, and folic acid off the dryer (e. g. 9, 047 vs. 7, 473 and 6, 945 IU/kg of vitamin D₃ for high vs. medium and low CP, respectively). During storage of finished pet food in AMB, vitamins A and D₃ were lost (P < 0. 05) to the greatest degree (49 and 22 %, respectively). The total retention following both processing and AMB storage was 27, 68, 78 % for vitamins A, D₃, and E, respectively, while folic acid and thiamine were relatively stable. In SSLT storage, all vitamins except vitamin E were depleted more than 60 % (P < 0. 05) by 24 weeks, whereas total retention following both processing and SSLT storage was 3, 59, 43, 33, and 7 % for vitamins A, D₃, and E, folic acid, and thiamine, respectively. This would suggest that beyond processing losses, the vitamins are relatively stable in premixes and foods if stored in AMB conditions. In the study to evaluate fatty acid stability within a vitamin premix, EPA, DHA, and total omega- 3 fatty acids were relatively stable during storage over 6 weeks with losses no greater than 12 % in stressed shelf life testing (SSLT; 40 C, 70 % RH). While in ambient conditions (23 C, 50 % RH) over 3 months, there was a total loss of EPA, DHA and total fatty acids by 17, 9, and 11 %, respectively. Exiting the extruder and dryer, EPA and DHA were not affected by CP level or Omega- 3 source. As SSLT storage of finished pet food increased through 24 weeks, EPA, DHA, and total fatty acids declined slightly (P < 0. 05; 125, 82 mg/kg for EPA and 77, 60 mg/kg for DHA, and 418, 476 mg/kg for total fatty acids at 0 vs. 24 wk. As time in ambient storage reached 24 months, EPA, DHA, and total fatty acids declined slightly (P < 0. 05; 125 vs. 78 mg/kg for EPA and 77 vs. 50 mg/kg for DHA, and 387 vs. 373 for total fatty acids at 0 vs. 24 mo.) Algal-DHA appears to be a stable source of DHA when compared to fish oil and fishmeal. During processing retention of fat soluble vitamins was less than water soluble vitamins, and the omega- 3 fatty acids were relatively unaffected. Whereas, vitamins appeared to be more sensitive to temperature during storage and the omega 3 fatty acids more affected by time...|$|R
