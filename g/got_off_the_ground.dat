5|$|The Spanish {{entered the}} American Revolutionary War in 1779. The British {{military}} planners in London wanted {{to secure the}} corridor of the Mississippi River against both Spanish and Patriot activity. Their plans included expeditions from West Florida to take New Orleans and other Spanish targets, including several expeditions {{to gain control of}} targets in the Upper Mississippi, such as the small town of St. Louis. The expedition from West Florida never <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> because Bernardo de Gálvez, the Governor of Spanish Louisiana, moved rapidly to gain control of British outposts on the Lower Mississippi and threatened action against West Florida's principal outposts of Mobile and Pensacola.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{recording}} sessions <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> Priestess encountered another problem – {{this time with}} the law. The band were working in a house in a neighborhood, and the close proximity to other houses meant that they had to keep the amount of noise generated to a minimum. They had been assured that the house had not previously been served with noise violations of any kind, but after they had finished recording drums and many of the guitar parts, they learned that they had the volume set too high when working on the bass guitar tracks; law enforcement came to the door and forced them to take their work elsewhere because they were shaking neighboring houses with the noise they were generating. The band did so with no objection, quickly moving their equipment to another studio, although they recalled the incident rather humorously later. Schiffman was able to arrange for the group to use another facility as early as the following day, and the band moved production to that new location the night of the incident. The sessions were completed in November 2008.|$|E

50|$|The manor was {{originally}} built in 1863 as a dowry house for Mary Phillips, {{the daughter of}} a Manchester based wool merchant Thomas. The property passed through several owners until it was purchased in 1980 by a consortium with the idea of turning it into a hotel and country club.

25|$|After {{the defeat}} of the {{picketing}} bill, Kamber was tapped by AFL-CIO president George Meany to head a labor law reform task force. Kamber's goal was to prioritize the AFL-CIO's labor law reform goals, strategize a plan for building support for the bill, and winning the legislation's enactment. The effort never <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> as political changes in Congress put the labor federation on the political defensive.|$|E
25|$|The {{financial}} {{climate in}} the early 1840s ensured that no further scheme <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> but by 1843, Parliament had passed an act enabling the Northern and Eastern Railway to extend the line to Newport (Essex). The following year, a further act was passed, extending the rights to build a railway through to Cambridge itself. In 1844, the Northern and Eastern Railway was leased by the Eastern Counties Railway, which built the extension.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} {{attempts}} to form alternative professional leagues in North America during the lockout, but both failed.

50|$|Around 1990, the China Ordnance Industries Corporation (COIC, a {{predecessor}} {{company to}} Norinco) purchased the complete rights and all machinery for manufacturing the SB308 Alto from Suzuki. COIC charged four hitherto military enterprises with manufacturing the Alto: Chongqing Chang'an, Jilin Jiangbei, Xiangtan Jiangnan, and Xi'an Qinchuan were all {{to switch over}} to civilian manufacture. Chongqing Chang'an were able to adapt Suzuki's Just-in-time manufacturing (JIT) methods and {{were the first to}} market the car, in 1992. Jilin Jiangbei lost money on each car built and ended up on the brink of bankruptcy; Xiangtan Jiangnan never <b>got</b> production <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> while Xi'an Qinchuan suffered a fire and chose to develop their own design instead (Qinchuan Flyer, the company was later made part of BYD Auto).

His concept was much more of a big tentpole movie, with scenes that defy the laws of physics.|$|E
25|$|A {{proposed}} American remake {{that would}} have starred Carrie Fisher and Barbara Carrera was put into motion by Roseanne Barr but never <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> However, Barr did incorporate many elements of the show into the final season of her eponymous show Roseanne, in which her character wins the lottery: Saunders and Lumley reprised their characters Edina and Patsy, and Mo Gaffney also appeared in the episode, but not as her character Bo. Two later American sitcoms, Cybill and High Society, also adapted elements of Absolutely Fabulous for the American audience.|$|E
25|$|Insistence on {{retaining}} its {{craft union}} identity kept it from establishing a stronger {{presence in the}} metals industries. The union was in crisis, however. The steel industry was growing quickly, and the skilled jobs in which AA members worked were disappearing. The union had to act {{in order to save}} itself. At the November 1909 AFL convention, AA president P.J. McArdle introduced a resolution, which quickly passed, calling for an organizing drive at U.S. Steel. By December, organizers were flooding plants throughout the Northeast and Midwest. But workers remained skittish after the failed 1901 strike, and the drive never <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Panther's {{first loss}} of the 2006 season came against the Raiders, a close, golden-point match. During the game, Clinton {{was hit by a}} high tackle from Raiders hooker Simon Woolford. Clinton {{received}} a black eye, but <b>got</b> up <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> smiling, and continued playing. Clinton's ability to brush <b>off</b> <b>the</b> hit left Woolford claiming the high tackle wasn't that serious. These comments left Clinton steaming, saying [...] "Woolford should learn to keep his mouth shut."In May 2006, Clinton was selected to trial for the New South Wales State of Origin team in the Country v.

500|$|Stengel {{has been}} praised {{for his role}} in {{successfully}} launching the Mets. Appel deemed the Mets' beginnings unique, as later expansion teams have been given better players to begin with, [...] "few expansion teams in any sport have tried the formula—a quotable, fan-popular man who would charm the press and deflect attention away from ineptness on the field." [...] Arthur Daley of The New York Times wrote, [...] "he gave the Mets the momentum they needed when they needed it most. He was the booster that <b>got</b> them <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and on their journey.

[...] James wrote, [...] "Stengel became such a giant character that you really can't talk about him in the past. He became an enduring part of the game." [...] Commissioner William Eckert said of Stengel, [...] "he's probably done more for baseball than anyone." ...|$|R
25|$|In April 1987 Berlin Regional inaugurated {{its first}} two {{scheduled}} routes from Berlin Tegel to Copenhagen and Geneva. Basle and Friedrichshafen joined Berlin Regional's scheduled route network in June 1987. Services to Brussels never <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> {{as a result of}} US major TWA's subsequent decision to enter the Tegel–Brussels market with a much bigger Boeing 727-100 from July 1987. Poor loads to Basle and Geneva forced Berlin Regional to combine these services. When Pan Am Express launched a competing Tegel–Basle route in November 1987, Berlin Regional dropped Basle from its schedule. Like Brussels, Kiel was never served, as a result of Pan Am Express's decision to serve this destination from Tegel itself. Ultimately, Copenhagen and Friedrichshafen were Berlin Regional's only surviving scheduled destinations.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} few years, Loos worked on more adaptations and {{traveled}} to see friends, while she and Gladys moved into a spacious apartment on West Fifty-Seventh Street.

Both Emerson and Helen Hayes' husband Charles MacArthur died within a few weeks of each other, and the women threw themselves into their work together, with Anita working on an adaptation for Hayes filming Anastasia in London. Loos worked and traveled even while being treated for a painful hand ailment that prevented her from writing. In 1959, Loos opened another Colette adaptation, Chéri, with Kim Stanley and Horst Buchholz in the title role, but it ran for only two months.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{in an effort}} to boost Downtown and upgrade the city's western entrance, Federal and state Urban Cultural Park grants were used on Mill Street, a small brick-paved street between State and Church streets. Two {{restaurants}} opened with great success but later folded during Downtown's continued decline. The project was a failure and was home to abandoned concrete kiosks, planters, and benches all disgraced by graffiti as of 2006. Another failed attempt at urban renewal was the $11 million Canal Square shopping plaza next to Proctor's Theatre in the 1980s. This was praised by then-President of the United States Ronald Reagan {{as an example of the}} good that could be done by the smart use of urban renewal money. The shopping plaza, however, failed due to suburban competition. Another proposal that never <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> was to level Proctor's for a shopping mall.|$|E

Bud Reahard and family purchased the Hickory Hill land. Hickory Hill became the site of the Hickory Hill Camp program, where campers learned primitive camp skills while staying in teepees, covered wagons or cabins. The name Waycross is described in the book edited by John Simmons, The History of Way cross-Hickory Hill Episcopal Camps 1957-1997. “The camp just happens to lie at the imaginary intersection of a cross that overlays the intersection of a cross that overlays the Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis. Hence the name Waycross, or where ways cross—a simple yet ingenious way of identifying its location that yielded one of the prettier sites in the state.” ...|$|R
