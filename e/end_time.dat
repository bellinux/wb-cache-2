5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift {{entering}} the coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that couple, opposite {{where she is}} sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like she did {{when she was younger}} as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They get married and have two sons. In the <b>end,</b> <b>time</b> returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop. Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are hanging on a white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white dress with a thin belt around the waist.|$|E

25|$|In {{the context}} of mysticism, the phrase refers metaphorically {{to the end of}} {{ordinary}} reality and reunion with the Divine.

25|$|Constantine's {{foundation}} gave prestige to the Bishop of Constantinople, {{who eventually}} {{came to be}} known as the Ecumenical Patriarch, and made it a prime center of Christianity alongside Rome. This contributed to cultural and theological differences between Eastern and Western Christianity eventually leading to the Great Schism that divided Western Catholicism from Eastern Orthodoxy from 1054 onwards. Constantinople is also of great religious importance to Islam, as the conquest of Constantinople is one of the signs of the <b>End</b> <b>time</b> in Islam.|$|E
25|$|Ford {{believes}} that {{victory over the}} guilt of sin (justification) was provided at the cross, victory over the power of sin (sanctification) {{is the work of}} a lifetime and victory over the presence of sin (glorification) occurs at the return of Christ Jesus. Ford disagrees with the belief of sinless perfection, and does not hold to the belief that the saints are sealed at the <b>end</b> <b>time,</b> but holds that the final removal of sin occurs when mortality changes to immortality at the return of Jesus Christ. Ford holds that victory over the presence of sin does not occur during this lifetime, so sin continues among the saints up to the return of Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|The view of Futurism, {{that the}} events happen in the <b>end</b> <b>time</b> was {{advanced}} by Francisco Ribera, a Jesuit priest, who developed this theory in In Sacrum Beati Ioannis Apostoli, & Evangelistiae Apocalypsin Commentarij, his 1585 treatise on the Book of Revelation. Saint Robert Bellarmine codified this view, giving in full the Catholic theory set forth by the Greek and Latin Fathers, of a personal Antichrist to come just {{before the end of}} the world and to be accepted by the Jews and enthroned in the temple at Jerusalem — thus endeavoring to dispose of the exposition which saw Antichrist in the pope. Most premillennial dispensationalists now accept Bellarmine's interpretation in modified form. Widespread Protestant identification of the Papacy as the Antichrist persisted in the USA until the early 1900s when the Scofield Reference Bible was published by Cyrus Scofield. This commentary promoted Futurism, causing a decline in the Protestant identification of the Papacy as Antichrist.|$|E

25|$|Closed mode systems, by definition, {{are closed}} without a vent. When making {{measurement}}s, closed systems take a CO2 measurement of ambient air {{just after the}} soil sample chamber is sealed. This becomes the CO2 reference. The system continues to take measurements at regular intervals {{over the next few}} minutes until a final CO2 concentration is recorded at a predetermined <b>end</b> <b>time</b> over time. Closed systems have the advantages that they are used by more researchers, and they provide wind proof results. Since there is no vent, wind is not an issue. When using a closed mode system, {{it is important that the}} experimental design include a maximum measuring time for two reasons: First; if the measuring time is too long, an unacceptable positive partial CO2 pressure can build up in the chamber limiting the amount of additional CO2 from entering the chamber, causing a measuring artifact. The second reason is that if a chamber that is closed for too long, it can modify ambient conditions and cause measuring artifacts. Finding the optimal measuring time range is important. Tests on the soil in question can confirm the best time solution, and eliminate the partial CO2 pressure buildup from being a significant issue.|$|E

He felt the album's cover art, featuring rusting metal surfaces, represented the cultural decline explored in the music's themes.

500|$|... is a Pulsian seeress hailing {{from the}} {{city-state}} of Paddra on Gran Pulse {{prior to the}} time of the War of Transgression, having written Analects relating to the event, Etro, Ragnarok, and the Eidolons. In the novel Fragments After, it is shown that Yeul was the first human created, and that for some unknown reason her soul does not fade after reaching the afterlife. Taking pity on her, Etro gives Yeul the ability to see the future, called the Eyes of Etro, and enables her to be continuously reincarnated throughout history. Though meant for the best, Yeul's ability to see the future becomes a curse, since each vision drains her lifeforce and she consequently always dies in her teens. Because of her fate, Caius Ballad, who had seen each Yeul live and die since before the War of Transgression, makes it his goal to destroy Etro and <b>end</b> <b>time</b> itself so Yeul would no longer die. Despite this, Yeul remains supportive of Noel and Serah's quest, and it is later revealed that she allowed herself to be reborn in order to be with Caius. Only one manifestation of Yeul is openly hostile towards the travelers and resentful of her fate. In Lightning Returns, the many versions of Yeul take up residence in the ruins of Etro's temple, with Caius as their guardian. It is revealed that Yeul's constant reincarnation caused her soul to fragment, with each previous life mingled with the Chaos and triggered the events of XIII-2. As the world ends, the souls of Yeul choose to stay and become the new goddess of death to restore the cycle of life Etro established. The final incarnation, who shares a strong bond with Noel and wishes for a new life, is allowed to leave and live as a normal human. Yeul is voiced by Amber Hood in English and Mariya Ise in Japanese.|$|E
