50|$|Cabinets {{may have}} a <b>face</b> <b>frame</b> or may be of {{frameless}} construction (also known as European or euro-style). <b>Face</b> <b>frame</b> cabinets have a supporting frame attached {{to the front of}} the cabinet box. This <b>face</b> <b>frame</b> is usually 1½ inches in width. Mounted on the cabinet frame is the cabinet door. In contrast, frameless cabinet have no such supporting front <b>face</b> <b>frame,</b> the cabinet doors attach directly to the sides of the cabinet box. The box’s side, bottom and top panels are usually 5/8 to 3/4 inches thick, with the door overlaying all but 1/16 inch of the box edge.Modern cabinetry is often frameless and is typically constructed from man-made sheet materials, such as plywood, chipboard or MDF. The visible surfaces of these materials are usually clad in a timber veneer, plastic laminate, or other material. They may also be painted.|$|E
50|$|A <b>face</b> <b>frame</b> in {{cabinet making}} is the frame {{fixed to the}} front of a cabinet carcass which obscures the edges of the carcass and {{provides}} the fixing point for doors and other external hardware.

5000|$|Door Mounting. For both face-frame and {{frameless}} kitchen cabinets, it is conventional for cabinet {{doors to}} overlay the cabinet carcase. Face-frame cabinets allow for various door mounting options. Traditional overlay doors do not abut, allowing a partial {{view of the}} face frames when the doors are closed. Full overlay cabinet doors fit closely so that they obscure the <b>face</b> <b>frame</b> when closed. A third and less conventional option for face-frame cabinets is to inset doors into, and flush with, the <b>face</b> <b>frame</b> (see below). Since frameless (see below) cabinet doors also fully overlay their carcases, the two types (frameless and full-overlay face-frame cabinets) have a similar installed appearance (when doors are closed), both may use European cup hinges, and both tend to use decorative door and drawer pulls (since {{there is no room}} for fingers at the door or drawer edge when installed).|$|E
50|$|Face {{frames are}} {{composed}} {{of a set of}} intersecting frame members that are joined to one another using one of a selection of woodworking joints. The most common joints used are the butt joint or mortise and tenon. The frames consist of vertical stiles and horizontal rails. Individual compartments within the cabinet are divided by mid-stiles and mid-rails. Individual drawers are usually separated by mid-rails and mid-stiles occur between doors and wherever vertical partitions exist within the cabinet (see image Parts of a <b>face</b> <b>frame).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Face-frame {{cabinets}}. Traditional cabinets {{are constructed}} using face frames which typically consist of narrow strips of hardwood framing the cabinet box opening. Cabinet carcasses were traditionally constructed with a separate <b>face</b> <b>frame</b> until the introduction of modern engineered wood such as particle board and medium-density fiberboard along with glues, hinges and fasteners required to join them. A <b>face</b> <b>frame</b> ensures squareness of the cabinet front. It also increases rigidity and provides a mounting point for hinges. Face-frames confer an appearance of strength and durability, and face-frame cabinets retain popularity in the U.S. An important distinction between modern (manufactured) and traditional custom-built face-frame cabinets relates to the catalog-selection of cabinet components entailed by mass production. Original custom face-frame cabinets accommodated multiple sections (cavities) in a single carcass. But stock (or semi-custom) face-frame cabinets are constructed individually and joined during installation. As a result, modern face-frame cabinets differ in having significantly wider (double-width) stile materials overall after installation. Two 1+1/2 in stiles joined as adjacent cabinets result in, effectively, a 3 in stile. Wide stiles can interfere {{with access to the}} cabinet interior. When base cabinets were typically shelved, this was not much of a drawback. But with base cabinets increasingly being fitted with trays and drawers (using modern hardware), the extra stile width results in significantly less access to the cabinet cavity space. This drawback does not pertain to custom face-frame cabinets.|$|E

50|$|Typically most {{patients}} with such maxillary deficiency (underbite), {{the use of}} a facemask for protraction of the jaw and maxilla {{is one of the most}} common treatment plans used. The Jean Delaire reverse pull facemask was introduced by Delaire in 1971. The Delaire facemask is unique in that it requires no additional headcap or straps to hold the appliance to the patients head, and it uses the direct force of the elastic bands into the child's mouth, attached to the braces using an intra-oral hook or a functional appliance, such as the Rapid Palatal Expander (RPE), to hold the mask or <b>face</b> <b>frame</b> in place.|$|E
5000|$|Face frame: first, the <b>face</b> <b>frame</b> is a {{metal and}} plastic {{structure}} which is adjusted to fit onto the patient's face. The frame is normally stabilized on the child's {{face with the}} aid of a chin cup and a forehead pad. These are padded to ensure patient comfort. The frame typically has a horizontal bar or mouth-yoke, which the orthodontist will adjust so it is correctly positioned in front of the patient's mouth to get the elastics to apply the force in the desired direction. The mouth yoke has a number of hooks (four to six depending on type of appliance, see photo with six hooks), which allows the orthodontist to attach elastics or springs directly into from the facemask into the patient's mouth. The frame allows the patient to move his or her head freely and to talk. All other oral activities are typically limited or restricted, such as eating or playing sports or playing a wind musical instruments, although drinking is recommended using a straw so as not to remove the whole appliance at night or in the day when thirsty.|$|E

Hershey, PA: IGI Global] observed a novel eye-size illusion: when increasing {{the size of}} a face but keeping the size of its eyes unchanged, the eyes are perceived to be smaller than in the original face. Here, we systematically manipulated the face size and found that the magnitude of this illusion linearly changed {{as a function of the}} <b>face</b> <b>frame</b> size (experiment 1). Additionally, the same magnitude of an illusion was observed for the perception of the size of the mouth when we changed the <b>face</b> <b>frame</b> but kept the mouth size constant (experiment 2). Further, when the faces and eyes were presented upside down, the magnitude of the illusion was significantly reduced in both Chinese participants (experiment 3) and Caucasian participants (experiment 4). The results suggest that the perception of eye or mouth size occurs in the relational context of the whole face; and when the face is inverted, thereby disrupting holistic processing, the magnitude of the illusion is reduced. We therefore suggest that holistic processing is involved in producing the illusion...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{examined}} {{the effect of}} visual experience on the magnitude of a novel eye-size illusion: when {{the size of a}} face's frame is increased or decreased but eye size is unchanged, observers judge the size of the eyes to be different from that in the original <b>face</b> <b>frame.</b> In the current study, we asked Chinese and Caucasian participants to judge eye size in different pairs of faces and measured the magnitude of the illusion when the faces were own- or other-age (adult vs. infant faces) and when the faces were own- or other-race (Chinese vs. Caucasian faces). We found an other-age effect and an other-race effect with the eye-size illusion: The illusion was more pronounced with own-race and own-age faces than with other-race and other-age faces. These findings taken together suggest that visual experience with faces influences the magnitude of this novel illusion. Extensive experience with certain face categories strengthens the illusion in the context of these categories, but lack of it reduces the magnitude of the illusion. Our results further imply that holistic processing may {{play an important role in}} engendering the eye-size illusion...|$|E

Sentient emotions at work: <b>face,</b> <b>frame</b> and self-ethic dialogues [...] Chapter 6. Coacting identity - in conclusion. "Work is central to human experience, influencing individuals' lives, value systems and identities and organizing and shaping societies. Globalization, increasing economic interdependencies and technological change have destabilized the experience of work, causing organizational rationalizing, downsizing, mergers and offshore employment, and making the individual's experience of work increasingly uncertain and anxious. The pace of change is set to continue, even increase. Using an interpretivist research paradigm and drawing on sociology, social psychology, moral philosophy and related disciplines, this research considers three 'moral' emotions - embarrassment, guilt and shame - and their relationships with personal identity-making. It draws on practice in a natural group setting during major organizational change to investigate the interpersonal emotional bridges between people and their experience of damage to these bridges. I contend that the interactional ongoing development of self-identity is intrinsically linked to the awareness of Other and can be analyzed through the Goffmanesque perspectives of the dialogues of face and frame. I consider the ethics of identity and further contend that the ethical orientation of communality, a social construct of particular importance in African/Akan philosophy, can provide a significant third perspective to face and frame to help understand the role of these sentient Other-oriented emotions in personal identity-making. My thesis makes five contributions. For scholars of identity, organizational change and sociologists of emotion, it proposes the addition of cognitively complex negative-affect valenced self-conscious emotions to the discussions of emotions in change. It proposes that Face and Frame are complementary analytical perspectives. It introduces {{the lens of the}} ethic of communality as a complement to individualism and extends Goffman by creating the Trilogy of Dialogues, <b>Face,</b> <b>Frame</b> and Self-ethic, to enable a more complete understanding of people's coactions with their self-identities. For practising managers, it will increase their ability to adapt and reinvent their organizations in times of major change, by providing a better understanding into the experience of change and the dilemmas and impact of sentient emotions.

40|$|Traditional {{accounts}} of face perception emphasise {{the importance of}} the prototypical configuration of features within faces. However, here we probe influences of more general perceptual grouping mechanisms on holistic face perception. Participants made part-matching judgments about composite faces presented in intact external oval frames or frames made from misaligned oval parts. This manipulation served to disrupt basic perceptual grouping cues that facilitate the grouping of the two face halves together. This manipulation also produced an external face contour like that in the standard misaligned condition used within the classic composite face task. Notably, by introducing a discontinuity in the external contour, grouping of the face halves into a cohesive unit was discouraged, but face configuration was preserved. Conditions where both the face parts and the frames were misaligned together, as in the typical composite task paradigm, or where just the internal face parts where misaligned, were also included. Disrupting only the <b>face</b> <b>frame</b> similarly disrupted holistic face perception as disrupting both the frame and face configuration. However, misaligned face parts presented in aligned frames also incurred a cost to holistic perception. These findings provide support for the contribution of general-purpose perceptual grouping mechanisms to holistic face perception and are presented and discussed {{in the context of an}} enhanced object-based selection account of holistic perception. 10 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The {{substantial}} efficiency improvements {{which have}} been realized in residential refrigerators over {{the last twenty years}} due to implementation of the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act and changing consumer reactions to energy savings give an indication of the potential for improvement in the commercial sector, where few such efficiency improvements have been made to date. The purchase decision for commercial refrigerators is still focused primarily on first cost and product performance issues such as maximizing storage capacity, quick pulldown, durability, and reliability. The project applied techniques used extensively to reduce energy use in residential refrigeration to a commercial reach-in refrigerator. The results will also be applicable to other commercial refrigeration equipment, such as refrigerated vending machines, reach-in freezers, beverage merchandisers, etc. The project described in this paper was a collaboration involving the Appliance and Building Technology Sector of TIAX, the Delfield Company, and the U. S. Department of Energy's Office of Building Technologies. Funding was provided by DOE through Cooperative Agreement No. DE-FC 26 - 00 NT 41000. The program plan and schedule were structured to assure successful integration of the TIAX work on development of efficient design concepts into Delfield's simultaneous development of the Vantage product line. The energy-saving design options evaluated as part of the development included brushless DC and PSC fan motors, high-efficiency compressors, variable-speed compressor technology, cabinet thermal improvement (particularly in the <b>face</b> <b>frame</b> area), increased insulation thickness, a trap for the condensate line, improved insulation, reduced-wattage antisweat heaters, non-electric antisweat heating, off-cycle defrost termination, rifled heat exchanger tubing, and system optimization (selection of heat exchangers, fans, and subcooling, superheat, and suction temperatures for efficient operation). The project started with a thorough evaluation of the baseline Delfield Model 6051 two-door reach-in refrigerator. Performance testing was done to establish a performance baseline which, to meet end-users requirements, would have to be met or exceeded by the high-efficiency refrigerator design. Energy testing was done to establish the baseline energy use. Diagnostic testing such as reverse heat leak testing and insulation conductivity testing was done to evaluate factors contributing to the cabinet load and energy use. Modeling was done to assess the energy savings potential of the energy saving design options. Discussion with vendors and cost modeling was done to assess the manufacturing cost impact of the options. Based on this work, the following group of design options was selected for incorporation in the final refrigerator design: (1) Brushless DC evaporator fans; (2) Improved <b>face</b> <b>frame</b> design; (3) Reduced antisweat heater wattage; (4) Condensate line trap; and (5) Optimized refrigeration system. There was no net cost premium associated with these design changes, leading to a high-efficiency design requiring no payback of any initial additional investment. Delfield incorporated these design options in the Vantage line design and built a first prototype, which was tested at TIAX. Additional design changes were implemented in the transition to manufacturing, based in part on results of initial prototype testing, and a pilot production unit was sent to TIAX for final testing. The energy use of the pilot production unit was 68 % less than that of the baseline refrigerator when tested according to the ASHRAE 117 Energy Test Standard. The energy test results for the baseline refrigerator and the two new-design units is shown in Figure ES- 1 below. The resulting energy consumption is well below Energy Star and proposed Canadian and California standards levels. Delfield has successfully transitioned the design to production and is manufacturing all configurations of the energy efficient reach-ins at a rate greater than 7, 000 per year, with production quantities projected to double within a year...|$|E
