5|$|As {{oil prices}} rose during the 1990s, Fairbanks' economy improved. The city was also boosted by the {{regrowth}} of gold mining in the area.

Despite a growing state population and recent economic development, many rural areas have been struggling over the past 50 years with locally declining populations and the emigration of educated young adults to larger South Dakota cities, such as Rapid City or Sioux Falls, or to other states. Mechanization and consolidation of agriculture has contributed greatly to the declining number of smaller family farms and the resulting economic and demographic challenges facing rural towns.|$|E

5|$|The Black Hills are in {{the southwestern}} part of South Dakota and extend into Wyoming. This range of low {{mountains}} covers 6,000sq. miles (15,500km2.) with mountains that rise from 2,000 to 4,000feet (600 to 1,200m) above their bases. The highest point in South Dakota, Black Elk Peak (formerly named Harney Peak) is 7,242ft or 2,207m above sea level {{and is in the}} Black Hills. This is the highest point in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. Other Black Hills mountains that are over 7,000ft (2,133m) in elevation include Bear Mountain, Crooks Tower, Terry Peak, and Crows Nest Peak. The Black Hills are rich in minerals such as gold, silver, copper, and lead. The Homestake Mine, the largest and deepest <b>gold</b> <b>mine</b> in North America, was located in the Black Hills and produced over $1billion in gold since it started operation in 1876. The mine is now a scientific laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the oldest}} rocks in Oregon, {{some of the}} {{formations}} in these terranes date to the Triassic, nearly 250million years ago. Between 165 and 170million years ago, in the Jurassic, faulting consolidated the Klamath terranes offshore during what geologists call the Siskiyou orogeny. This three- to five-million-year episode of intense tectonic activity pushed sedimentary rocks deep enough into the mantle to melt them and then forced them to the surface as granitic plutons. Belts of plutons, which contain gold and other precious metals, run through the Klamaths and include the Ashland pluton, the Grayback batholith east of Oregon Caves National Monument, the Grants Pass pluton, the Gold Hill pluton, the Jacksonville pluton, and others. Miners have worked rich deposits of gold, silver, copper, nickel, and other metals in several districts of the Klamaths. Placer mining in the mid-19thcentury soon led to lode mining for gold. Aside from a mine in eastern Oregon, the Greenback Mine along Grave Creek, a Rogue tributary, was the most productive <b>gold</b> <b>mine</b> in Oregon.|$|E

Data were collected in January 2010 and law enforcement records kept at CNP were examined to gather trends in artisanal gold miner’s arrests. Field visits to areas affected by artisanal <b>gold</b> <b>mining</b> in CNP were undertaken and key informants were interviewed. Site observations in some sections of CNP indicated that destructive methods of artisanal <b>gold</b> <b>mining</b> were used.

5|$|Egypt {{is rich in}} {{building}} and decorative stone, copper and lead ores, gold, and semiprecious stones. These natural resources allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments, sculpt statues, make tools, and fashion jewelry. Embalmers used salts from the Wadi Natrun for mummification, which also provided the gypsum needed to make plaster. Ore-bearing rock formations were found in distant, inhospitable wadis in the eastern desert and the Sinai, requiring large, state-controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there. There were extensive gold mines in Nubia, {{and one of the}} first maps known is of a <b>gold</b> <b>mine</b> in this region. The Wadi Hammamat was a notable source of granite, greywacke, and gold. Flint was the first mineral collected and used to make tools, and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley. Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose. Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as sulfur as cosmetic substances.|$|E

There were fake telegrams purporting to be from Emperor Alexander II of Russia, congratulating Norton on his forthcoming marriage to Queen Victoria, and from the President of France, predicting that such a union would be disastrous to world peace.

40|$|M. Sc. The <b>gold</b> <b>mining</b> {{industry}} in South Africa {{is exposed to}} various legal issues {{due to the nature}} of its operations. Furthermore, there has been a renewed focus on environmental management in South Africa over the past decade, as well as an international focus on sustainable development. Environmental management in the <b>gold</b> <b>mining</b> industry must incorporate sustainable development, as well as the ‘cradle to grave’ concept. The <b>gold</b> <b>mining</b> industry has to ensure that its activities are compliant with environmental legislation and best practice requirements, as the increase in environmental awareness and legislated principles has escalated gold mines’ exposure to demands for the remediation and reparations of pollution and environmental degradation. No single document exists that provides the <b>gold</b> <b>mining</b> industry with detail on the environmental legislation and best practice requirements that <b>gold</b> <b>mines</b> are able to refer to in order ensure effective environmental management. Furthermore, there is no implementation plan for <b>gold</b> <b>mines</b> to implement in order to achieve compliance with environmental legislation and best practice requirements.
