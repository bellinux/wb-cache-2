40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{order to}} reduce/prevent {{combination}} Anti-Retroviral Therapy (cART) -related toxicity, while maintaining its therapeutic effectiveness over time, the optimization of the antiretroviral therapy could be performed. AIM: To estimate {{the economic impact}} on the Italian National Health Service (NHS) of a cART optimization pathway as maintenance therapy in HIV- 1 infected patients over one-year period. METHODS: Patient data were retrieved from the electronic medical record system in use (year 2015) in a reference HIV Center in Northern Italy. The analysis considered naïve patients and non-naïve patients. To estimate the actual ART <b>expenditure</b> <b>charged</b> to the Center we calculated the cost of cART received during 12 months for each patient. Subsequently, referring to the same patients, a "potential" cART expenditure was estimated. This potential expenditure was estimated taking in consideration {{the adoption of a}} specific optimization pathway aimed at maintaining over the time the cART efficacy. Lastly, to assess the sustainability of the optimization pathway, we compared the actual cART expenditure with the potential one. We considered only drug costs (ex-factory prices, included all discounts and VAT) {{from the perspective of the}} Italian NHS. RESULTS: In the 2015, the total expenditure for 564 enrolled HIV- 1 patients treated with cART was € 4, 042, 983. The mean treatment cost per patient was € 7, 168. If the Center adopted a specific optimization pathway, the total expenditure would be € 3, 914, 855 (€ - 128, 128). CONCLUSIONS: From the Italian NHS’s perspective, the adoption of a specific cART optimization pathway represents a cost-saving option as maintenance antiretroviral therapy in HIV- 1 infected patients...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine the {{accounting}} and auditing in the Spanish Royal Household between 1561 and 1808. The Royal Household was the third most important item of expenditure that the State Treasury financed, after the Army and Navy and the National Debt. On studying spending control in the Royal Household, we have rejected the idea, often advanced by historiography, that there was no spending control within this institution. On the contrary, treasurers and accountants were only able to release funds for expenditure purposes on the basis of prior authorization. However, the efficiency of spending control was very limited due to technical, administrative and, above all, social and political elements.

As long as slaughter houses are utilized by the resident users to serve meat to resident consumers, they might be managed as public facilities where slaughtering charge was set at so low that its revenue was far short of its cost. The balance of accounts was made from the general revenue which resident people paid as tax. As meat marketing areas have been widened due to technological progress in transportation, communication and cold storage, the new condition has evolved that non-resident users enter into the slaughter houses and considerable amount of meat is distributed to other areas. As a result of this, {{it has not been}} appropriate to justify the current principle of marketing the accounts balance at the expence of tax revenue. The three methods of establishing the rate of slaughtering charge which regarded as appropriate to the new marketing conditions are examined by using the data of Buzen Municipal Slaughter House, Fukuoka Prefecture. The first method is to raise the rate at the level where the balance of accounts can be achieved. The second one is to establish the different rate between resident users and non-resident users. The third one is to achieve the balance of accounts by both public <b>expenditure</b> and <b>charges</b> paid at the different rate between resident users and non-resident users.

40|$|Summaries This article {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} public expenditure policy on poverty reduction, focusing on the interaction between poverty assessments (PAs) and public expenditure reviews (PERs). Most PAs have analysed poverty {{in terms of the}} constraints that prevent the poor from participating in labour intensive growth, with little appreciation of sociological and political factors involved. Most PERs have concentrated on three issues: increasing the share of the education and health sectors within total public expenditure, the composition of spending within these sectors and the balance between staff and non?staff costs. However, increased budgetary allocations to the social sectors often do not get translated into reality because of poor management and monitoring of public expenditure. In addition, the use of cash budgeting to eliminate fiscal deficits in line with IMF conditionality works against World Bank conditionality aimed at increasing spending in priority social sectors. Greater integration of PAs and PERs should be promoted by estimating the net impact of government <b>expenditure</b> and taxation/user <b>charges</b> on the poor.

Methods: This was a retrospective case-control study comparing 1 -year (2000) utilization and expenditures for medical and pharmacy care between 18 _ 061 COPD patients and 18 _ 061 age-, sex-, and geographically matched control patients without COPD. Total medical expenditures were calculated using the actual amounts requested by the submitting provider. Total pharmacy <b>expenditures</b> were the <b>charge</b> for each prescription medication to the health plan. Results: Healthcare utilization, in terms of hospitalizations, emergency room admissions, and outpatient encounters, were two to three times higher in the patients with COPD than the control patients. Per person total healthcare expenditures {{for patients with}} COPD were 25 times (respiratory-related) and 1. 6 times (nonrespiratory) greater than those for the matched control patients.

Dental sealants {{have been shown}} to be effective in reducing caries. Most believe sealants are still underused, particularly among children who need sealants the most. Because the caries prevalence continues to decline, and the disparities in children's dental heath and dental care still exist, more efficient sealant placement strategies should be implemented based on the scientific information from cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of dental sealant at the community level. Previous CEAs of sealant using observational datasets were unreliable because they did not address the self-selection problem. The objectives of this study are to examine the utilization of dental sealants and its determinants, evaluate the incremental effectiveness and expenditure associated with sealant placement after correcting the potential selection issue, and explore the differences in sealant's cost-effectiveness among subpopulations. This study mainly utilized enrollment data and encounter data from a large Health Maintenance Organization in Minnesota. The study sample included 3, 700 children aged 6 to 17 years during 1997 to 2001 and were continuously enrolled for 5 years. They all had a caries risk assessment (CRA), which was conducted at the beginning of the observation period, and no prior caries record for their included first permanent molars (FPMs). The CRAs were classified into three scores: low, moderate and high risk. Information on the 64 dentists who participated in the study was linked to the encounter data to identify those who conducted CRAs. Outcome variables included discounted effectiveness, as measured by the duration of caries-free state (healthy months) of a FPM, and the discounted cost associated with caries treatments, within the study period. The key independent variables included demographic variables (e. g., age, gender, race), caries risk level, socio-economic status, sealant placement, and preventive care utilization. Bivariate analysis and logistic analysis were performed to examine the pattern of sealant utilization and identify the determinants affecting sealant placement decision. Econometric models including classic Tobit model, selectivity-corrected Tobit model, classic two-part model, and selectivity-corrected two-part model were used to examine the selection issue and obtain unbiased marginal effects of sealant on caries-free duration and caries-related treatment cost. The working experience of the dentists who conducted the initial CRAs was used as the instrumental variable. The bootstrap method was used to obtain standard errors and confidence intervals for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were performed. In this study, approximately 77 % of the sample had one or more FPM sealed during the entry period, more than half of them had all four FPMs sealed. Children aged 6 to 8 were more likely to receive sealant than children aged 9 or older. Children at relatively high caries risk, as well as children who visited dentists for preventive care more than once a year, had greater odds of receiving sealants. Non-white children or those from families with low incomes or low education level were more likely to receive sealant. This study also identified some dentists' characteristics, such as age, gender, and working experience as the good predictors of sealant decision. After 5 years, the sealant group had more individuals (83. 9 %) and more FPMs (94. 3 %) that stayed healthy compared with the non-sealant group in which 83. 1 % of the sample individuals and 91. 8 % of FPMs stayed healthy. A sealed FPM was associated with $ 56. 84 <b>expenditure</b> (initial sealant <b>charge</b> was $ 39. 00) over 5 years, and an unsealed FPM was associated with $ 13. 13 expenditure. The sample-average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $ 38 /caries-free month for each FPM. Based on the results from econometric models, sealants were associated with a lower probability of having any caries, longer caries-free duration, an increased probability of using any resource, and less resources consumption. The final ICER indicates that sealant cost $ 42. 16 more than non-sealant treatment to get one more caries-free month for each FPM. The 95 % CI was $ 22. 64 to $ 85. 40 per one more caries-free month for each FPM. Significant selection or endogeniety issue was not found in either the effectiveness or cost analysis based on the whole sample, but it existed when analyzing sealant effects among certain subgroup children. The results from subgroup analysis show that sealing children at high risk for caries appears to be highly cost effective. In contrast, sealing children at low risk for caries would be much less cost effective. Sealing the FPMs of infrequent utilizers of preventive care appears to be more cost effective than frequent utilizers of preventive care. There is no significant difference in ICERs between sealing younger children and sealing older children. In conclusion, sealant application is not always cost effective. A uniform and fixed sealant utilization goal may not be appropriate. Sealant application should be increased among the high risk populations, such as those with previous caries or low dental care utilizers, or those directly deemed at high caries risk by dentists. The caries risk assessment procedure can improve clinical decisions on sealant application and increase efficient sealant delivery...|$|R
