Rather it <b>emanates</b> <b>from</b> God's creation—when that creation reflects and evinces God's glory from within itself. The word can be translated or identified as positive communication, royalty/kingly dynasty, or humility.|$|R

5|$|Canberra is {{a planned}} {{city and the}} inner-city area was {{originally}} designed by Walter Burley Griffin, a major 20th-century American architect. Within the central area of the city near Lake Burley Griffin, major roads follow a wheel-and-spoke pattern rather than a grid. Griffin's proposal had an abundance of geometric patterns, including concentric hexagonal and octagonal streets <b>emanating</b> <b>from</b> several radii. However, the outer areas of the city, built later, are not laid out geometrically.|$|E

5|$|The UBS's Basel III {{capital ratio}} {{concerned}} {{benefited from the}} appreciation of the Swiss franc.

5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a flat sheet of paper, all <b>emanating</b> <b>from</b> the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded sheet of paper lies flat.|$|E
5|$|A police {{van with}} two {{officers}} arrived {{a short time}} after the shootings began, at around 11:00. They entered the yard of the college where they were shot at by Saari, and forced to retreat. From around 11:45 to 12:00 further police units, bolstered {{by a number of}} armoured vehicles, began to arrive on the scene. They attempted to enter the building through the main corridor, but this assault was aborted due to the black smoke that was <b>emanating</b> <b>from</b> within the building.|$|E

5|$|As he is {{affected}} less by the distortions, Data is sent down alone and disables the remaining security measures before entering Manheim's laboratory. He finds {{a column of}} energy <b>emanating</b> <b>from</b> a dimensional matrix, {{the source of the}} time distortions. Data, though briefly affected by the time distortions, is able to add anti-matter to the matrix, causing the matrix to stabilize and halt the time distortions. Dr. Manheim fully recovers, and he and Jenice thank Picard and the crew for their help. Picard and Jenice use the holodeck to recreate one more encounter at a Paris café, before she returns with her husband to the planet.|$|E
5|$|Daughter of the Chedi king, Vasu (also {{known as}} Uparichara Vasu) and a cursed apsara (celestial nymph) turned fish called Adrika, Satyavati {{was brought up}} as a commoner.

5|$|Due to {{its small}} size and {{location}} {{away from the}} plane of the Milky Way, Caelum is rather devoid of deep-sky objects, and contains no Messier objects. The only deep-sky object in Caelum to receive much attention is HE0450-2958, an unusual Seyfert galaxy. Originally, the jet's host galaxy proved elusive to find, and this jet appeared to be <b>emanating</b> <b>from</b> nothing. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the object is an ejected supermassive black hole, the host is now agreed to be a small galaxy that is difficult to see due to light from the jet and a nearby starburst galaxy.|$|E

5|$|In late 1916 {{and early}} 1917, secret peace talks {{took place between}} Austria-Hungary and France. There is circumstantial {{evidence}} that parallel discussions were held between Austria-Hungary and Serbia with Prime Minister Pašić dispatching his righthand man Stojan Protić and Regent Alexander dispatching his confidant Colonel Petar Živković to Geneva on secret business. Charles I of Austria laid out Austria-Hungary's key demand for returning Serbia to {{the control of the}} Serbian Government in exile: that Serbia should provide guarantees that there be no further political agitation <b>emanating</b> <b>from</b> Serbia against Austria-Hungary.|$|E
5|$|Josephine {{reached its}} peak {{intensity}} of 65mph (100km/h) around 8 a.m. (EDT) as it continued to become more organized. However, there were indications that it {{had already begun to}} weaken. Outflow towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began <b>emanating</b> <b>from</b> the storm, a sign that dry air was entering the system. During the afternoon hours, the structure of Josephine began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll. By the late night, the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center.|$|E
5|$|Larval ticks hatch {{with six}} legs, {{acquiring}} {{the other two}} after a blood meal and molting into the nymph stage. In the nymphal and adult stages, ticks have eight legs, {{each of which has}} seven segments and is tipped with a pair of claws. The legs are sometimes ornamented and usually bear sensory or tactile hairs. In addition to being used for locomotion, the tarsus of leg I contains a unique sensory structure, Haller's organ, which can detect odors and chemicals <b>emanating</b> <b>from</b> the host, as well as sensing changes in temperature and air currents. When not being used for walking, the legs remain tightly folded against the body.|$|E
