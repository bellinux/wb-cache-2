25|$|The two {{learned that}} not {{everyone}} was worthy of credit. Henry H. Birdsall and his wife took out a mortgage from the Geo. Washington Bank on a property that ended up in <b>foreclosure</b> <b>proceedings</b> in 1857; the matter was unsuccessfully appealed to the New York Court of Appeals in 1876.|$|E
25|$|Next {{announced}} was Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford. The 1934 Frazier-Lemke Farm Bankruptcy Act {{was designed}} to give aid to debt-ridden farmers, allowing them to reacquire farms they had lost from foreclosure, or to petition the Bankruptcy Court within their district to suspend <b>foreclosure</b> <b>proceedings.</b> The legislation's ultimate goal was to help those farmers scale down their mortgages.|$|E
50|$|Despite the act's {{official}} title dating it to 1940, {{its origins}} {{can be traced}} {{as far back as}} the Civil War when the United States Congress passed a total moratorium on civil actions brought against Union soldiers and sailors. In basic terms, this meant that any legal action involving a civil matter was put on hold until after the soldier or sailor returned from the war. Examples of civil matters included breach of contract, bankruptcy, <b>foreclosure</b> or divorce <b>proceedings.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn Romania, the {{mediation}} {{has become a}} mandatory prior procedure, together with the direct conciliation in disputes of a commercial nature, following the amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure by Law. 202 / 2010. Mediation occurs both in the extra-procedural, ie {{before the onset of}} a trial before the court, and also in the trial stage, ie once someone had claimed summons, calls or appeals. The need for cooperation with the entrepreneurial environment in order to increase his competitiveness and his assertion at European and global level effort leads to increasing the EU Member States efforts in order to offer theirs citizens some clear and convincing answers regarding the business environment and their own business. The need for mediation occurs in a conflict with the business partner, in contract implementation problems (large delays in payments, non-delivery or delay in delivery of goods/services requested, etc.), where the firm is threatened with insolvency, <b>foreclosure</b> or other <b>proceedings</b> likely to put own business in difficulty. If no one wants to go to court or, even if already reached, mediation may be the most advantageous way to end as soon as possible the conflict which is likely to damage the business. In this context we will show, in what follows, the advantages and the benefits of mediation in the context of voluntary dispute resolution within the business environment...|$|R
25|$|The {{new owner}} {{applied to the}} city for an {{exemption}} from the real estate transfer tax it charges, {{on the grounds that}} it had acquired the property through <b>foreclosure</b> <b>proceedings.</b> It was granted, because the city normally does not charge lenders in those situations since they usually resell the property. Later, however, the city learned that Jerome Properties in fact intended to retain and benefit from ownership. In 2010, it told Jerome Property that the sale might indeed be taxable.|$|E
25|$|After {{the school}} closed, H. Eugene MacDonald, a former Springs Valley resident, {{purchased}} the property from in October 1983. MacDonald, who had owned other hotels, wanted {{to operate the}} property as a hotel, but lacked the financial resources for the restoration work. He executed a sale-and-leaseback deal with Marlin Properties, a Los Angeles historical renovation developer, for $1.5 million, but a $250,000 payment from Marlin was returned for nonsufficient funds in 1985. Before MacDonald could begin <b>foreclosure</b> <b>proceedings,</b> Marlin declared bankruptcy and the hotel's ownership was tied up in litigation for nearly a decade.|$|E
25|$|Between 1905 and 1917, {{the school}} dropped the Palmer name and {{operated}} as the Indiana Normal College. It had two divisions, the Normal School for educating {{teachers and the}} College of Applied Sciences. The school had an average enrollment of about 200 students. Due to diminishing enrollment and lack of funding, school president Francis Ingler closed Indiana Normal College {{at the end of}} the 1906–1907 school year. Between 1907 and 1912, the campus sat unused. In 1912, a group of local investors led by Michael Kelly reopened the school as the Indiana Normal Institute. To pay for updated materials and refurbishing the once-abandoned Administration Building, the school operated under a mortgage from the Muncie Trust Company. Although the school had its largest student body with a peak enrollment of 806, officials could not maintain mortgage payments, and the school was forced to close once again in June 1917 when the Muncie Trust Company initiated <b>foreclosure</b> <b>proceedings.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In 1976, Union Planters Bank began <b>foreclosure</b> <b>proceedings</b> on $3.5 {{million in}} debts. In 1977, Al Capp and the Li'l Abner comic strip retired. Capp's {{retirement}} brought {{an end to}} one of the greatest advertisements for Dogpatch USA [...] the Li'l Abner comic strip. The same year, First National Bank of Little Rock began <b>foreclosure</b> <b>proceedings</b> on $600,000 in debts. In September of that year, Odom stated that, because Marble Falls had lost $50,000 to $100,000 a year since it opened, the ski slopes would be closed permanently. In subsequent years, various activities, including grass skiing, a gaming arcade, a 400-foot water slide, and a disco, were advertised at Marble Falls along with the resort accommodations. New attractions included the Slobbovian Sled Run, Grist Mill Puppet Theater, Rottin' Ralphies Rick-o-shay Rifle Range, and Barney Barnsmell's Skunk-works. New attractions in 1978 included Li'l Abner's Space Rocket, which was intended to simulate a flight into space.|$|E
2500|$|The Fort Mall {{is located}} on a 12-acre parcel {{on the east side}} of downtown, {{containing}} [...] of retail space. [...] In February 2003, a new purchaser promised renovations, but the opening of nearby larger Cornerstone Mall that year only worsened the mall's situation. [...] The planned renovations were never completed, and a new owner came in and in 2007 proposed to demolish part of the mall to construct apartments or condominiums. [...] <b>Foreclosure</b> <b>proceedings</b> began in 2008, and the mall was listed for judicial sale. [...] The initial asking price was $8 million, and a $4 million bid from the city in the fall of 2009 was rejected. [...] In February 2010, the mall was relisted for sale at $5 million, and a $4.35 million offer accepted by the court in April.|$|E
2500|$|Another dynamic {{also contributed}} to the large number of cooperatives {{established}} in the 1980s and 1990s in New York City – in this case by low- and moderate-income tenant groups. [...] In the 1970s, many New York City private landlords were struggling to maintain their aging properties in the face of high interest rates, redlining, white flight and rising fuel costs. The period also saw some landlord-induced arson to obtain insurance proceeds and widespread non-payment of real estate taxes – over 20% of multi-family residential properties were in arrears in the mid-1970s. In 1977, the city passed Local Law #45, which allowed the city to begin <b>foreclosure</b> <b>proceedings</b> after just one year of non-payment of taxes, not three, resulting in the takeover of thousands of buildings, many of them occupied, by the city of New York through a legal action known as an in rem foreclosure. [...] In September 1978, the city’s housing agency, the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), created a series of new housing programs designed to give building residents and community groups control and eventual ownership of in rem buildings.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2011, JPMorgan Chase {{admitted}} that it wrongly overcharged several thousand military families for their mortgages, including active duty personnel in Afghanistan. The bank also admitted it improperly foreclosed {{on more than}} a dozen military families; both actions were in clear violation of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act which automatically lowers mortgage rates to 6 percent, and bars <b>foreclosure</b> <b>proceedings</b> of active duty personnel. The overcharges may have never come to light were it not for legal action taken by Captain Jonathan Rowles. Both Captain Rowles and his spouse Julia accused Chase of violating the law and harassing the couple for nonpayment. An official stated that the situation was [...] "grim", and Chase initially stated it would be refunding up to $2,000,000 to those who were overcharged, and that families improperly foreclosed on have gotten or will get their homes back. Chase has acknowledged that as many as 6,000 active duty military personnel were illegally overcharged, and more than 18 military families homes were wrongly foreclosed. In April, Chase agreed to pay a total of $27million in compensation to settle the class-action suit. At the company's 2011 shareholders' meeting, Dimon apologized for the error and said the bank would forgive the loans of any active-duty personnel whose property had been foreclosed. In June 2011, lending chief Dave Lowman was forced out over the scandal.|$|E

50|$|The <b>foreclosure</b> <b>proceedings</b> are {{effectively}} stopped until the referee or judicial hearing officer (JHO) {{in the settlement}} conference determines that the settlement conferences are concluded, either because the parties have successfully modified the home loan or obtained some other foreclosure alternative or the referee has determined {{that one of the}} parties has not satisfied its requirements under the law. Settlement conferences do not produce formal dispositions but may facilitate loan modifications and stop foreclosure. The referee or JHO will make a recommendation to the judge overseeing the <b>foreclosure</b> <b>proceedings</b> once the settlement conference is concluded.|$|E
