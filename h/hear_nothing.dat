25|$|Tyndaris again bore a {{considerable}} {{part in the}} war between Sextus Pompeius and Octavian (36 BC). It {{was one of the}} points occupied and fortified by the former, when preparing for the defence of the Sicilian straits, but was taken by Agrippa after his naval victory at Mylae, and became one of his chief posts, from which he carried on offensive warfare against Pompey. Subsequently to this we <b>hear</b> <b>nothing</b> more of Tyndaris in history; but there is no doubt of its having continued to subsist throughout the period of the Roman Empire. Strabo speaks of it as one of the places on the north coast of Sicily which, in his time, still deserved the name of cities; and Pliny gives it the title of a Colonia. It is probable that it received a colony under Augustus, as we find it bearing in an inscription the titles of Colonia Augusta Tyndaritanorum. Pliny indeed mentions a great calamity which the city had sustained, when (he tells us) half of it was swallowed up by the sea, probably from an earthquake having caused the fall of part of the hill on which it stands, but we have no clue to the date of this event; The Itineraries attest the existence of Tyndaris, apparently still as {{a considerable}} place, in the fourth century.|$|E

25|$|Tibullus's {{first book}} {{consists}} of poems written {{at various times}} between 30 and 26. His first love, the subject of book i., is called Delia in the poems, but Apuleius (Apol. 10) reveals that her real name was Plania. As regards her station, it should be noticed {{that she was not}} entitled to wear the stola, the dress of Roman matrons (i. 6, 68). Her husband is mentioned as absent (i. 2, 67 seq.). She eludes the custodes placed over her (i. 2, 15 and 6, 7). Tibullus's suit was favoured by Delia's mother, of whom he speaks in very affectionate terms (i. 6, 57 seq.). For Tibullus's illness at Corcyra, see i. 3, I seq., 55 seq. The fifth elegy was written during estrangement (discidium), and the sixth after the return of the husband and during Delia's double infidelity. It is impossible to give an exact account of the intimacy. The poems which refer to her are arranged in no chronological order. Sometimes she appears as single, sometimes as married; but we <b>hear</b> <b>nothing</b> either of her marriage or of her husband's death. Yet it is clear that it was the absence of her husband on military service in Cilicia which gave Tibullus the opportunity to see her, and he continued to do so when the husband returned. Delia was clever in deception—too clever, as Tibullus saw when he found that he was not the only lover. His entreaties and appeals were of no avail; and after the first book no more is heard of Delia. In addition, several elegies in Book I concern themselves with Tibullus's love for a boy, who is named Marathus.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{party of}} Argentine Marines {{assumed that the}} Moody Brook Barracks {{contained}} sleeping Royal Marines. The barracks were quiet, although a light was on {{in the office of}} the Royal Marine commander. No sentries were observed, and it was a quiet night, apart from the occasional animal call.

[...] Nor had things improved in Clara's view a few years later, when Rubinstein gave a concert in Breslau. [...] She noted in her diary, [...] "I was furious, for he no longer plays.

2500|$|... Two Japanese {{soldiers}} have {{climbed over the}} garden wall and are about to break into our house. When I appear they give the excuse that they saw two Chinese soldiers climb over the wall. When I show them my party badge, they return the same way. In {{one of the houses}} in the narrow street behind my garden wall, a woman was raped, and then wounded in the neck with a bayonet. I managed to get an ambulance so we can take her to Kulou Hospital. (...) Last night up to 1,000 women and girls are said to have been raped, about 100 girls at Ginling College Girls alone. You <b>hear</b> <b>nothing</b> but rape. If husbands or brothers intervene, they're shot. What you hear and see on all sides is the brutality and bestiality of the Japanese soldiers." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{advertising}} and marketing campaign for Paranormal State broke new ground. In November 2007, a six-story billboard was erected {{at the corner of}} Prince and Mulberry Streets in New York City by [...] Behind the billboard were two directional audio (or audioSpotlights) which produce a highly focused beam of sound. Passers-by who walked directly {{in the path of the}} sound would hear spooky, disembodied voices whispering suggestive messages such as [...] "What's that?" [...] and [...] "Who's there? It's not your imagination." [...] But someone standing next to that person would <b>hear</b> <b>nothing.</b> The billboard had a dramatic effect on people coming within range of the [...] "cone of sound" [...] created by the directional audio speakers. The billboard was apparently the first commercial use of the technology on a billboard. A video of the installation can be seen here.|$|E
2500|$|At his {{memorial}} service Leikny Øgrim told {{of growing up}} with a big brother who would read the dictionary {{from beginning to end}} and who from reading even the telephone book could learn something to relate to acquaintances. Douglas Draper, secretary of the Norwegian Esperanto League, also delivered a short talk on behalf of the NEL, by turns bantering and earnest. He said there were three kinds of Esperantists. There were active members engaged in management and organizational duties. There were passive members satisfied with paying their dues. Then there was Tron Øgrim. It might happen that for long periods the NEL would <b>hear</b> <b>nothing</b> from him; then he would telephone to ask: [...] "Skylder jeg noe gryn?" [...] ("Do I owe any groats?"—i.e., membership dues.) He might show up at the NEL office in Oslo and purchase not one or two books, but a whole load. While most Esperantists would plan their trips to major Esperanto congresses more than six months in advance, Tron might call up three days {{before the start of the}} event and ask what he could do to help out.|$|E

2500|$|Tatum drew {{inspiration}} from the pianists James P. Johnson and Fats Waller, who exemplified the stride piano style, and from the more [...] "modern" [...] Earl Hines, six years Tatum's senior. [...] Tatum identified Waller as his main influence, but according to pianist Teddy Wilson and saxophonist Eddie Barefield, [...] "Art Tatum's favorite jazz piano player was Earl Hines. He used to buy all of Earl's records and would improvise on them. He'd play the record but he'd improvise over what Earl was doing ... 'course, when you heard Art play you didn't <b>hear</b> <b>nothing</b> of anybody but Art. But he got his ideas from Earl's style of playing – but Earl never knew that." [...] A major event in his meteoric rise to success was his appearance at a cutting contest in 1933 at Morgan's bar in New York City that included Waller, Johnson and Willie [...] "The Lion" [...] Smith. [...] Standard contest pieces included Johnson's [...] "Harlem Strut" [...] and [...] "Carolina Shout", and Waller's [...] "Handful of Keys". Tatum performed his arrangements of [...] "Tea for Two" [...] and [...] "Tiger Rag", in a performance that {{was considered to be}} the last word in stride piano. [...] Johnson, reminiscing about Tatum's debut afterward, simply said, [...] "When Tatum played Tea For Two that night I guess {{that was the first time}} I ever heard it really played." [...] Tatum's debut was historic because he outplayed the elite competition and heralded the demise of the stride era. [...] He was not challenged further until stride specialist Donald Lambert initiated a half-serious rivalry with him.|$|E
