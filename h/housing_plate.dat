40|$|Dynamic {{finite element}} {{analysis}} of a real gear housing is presented. The analysis was conducted for the housing without the rotating components (gears, shafts, and bearings). Both rigid and flexible mounting conditions for the gear housing are considered in this analysis. The flexible support simulates the realistic mounting condition on a rotorcraft, and the rigid one is analyzed for comparison purposes. The effect of gear housing stiffeners is also evaluated. The {{results indicate that the}} first six natural modes of the flexibly mounted gear housing in the 0 to 200 Hz range correspond to the translational and rotational rigid body vibration modes of the housing. Above this range, the <b>housing</b> <b>plate</b> elastic modes begin to occur. In the case of the rigid mount, only the <b>housing</b> <b>plate</b> elastic modes are observed which are verified by modal analysis experiments. Parametric studies show that the <b>housing</b> <b>plate</b> stiffeners and rigid mounts tend to increase most of the natural frequencies, the lower ones being affected the most...|$|E

The effect was analyzed of the shape of additional ribs on changes of the forms of vibration of the upper <b>housing</b> <b>plate</b> and on its vibroactivity. Simulations were conducted using the Finite Element Method (FEM). Based on the studies performed, the shape of ribs with dimensions ensuring a reduction of vibroactivity by several dB was determined, with a minor increase of the housing weight...|$|E

Several {{materials}} {{have been used}} for <b>plating</b> the <b>housing</b> working surface, Nikasil being one.

For the apex seals, the choice of materials has evolved along with the experience gained, from carbon alloys, to steel, ferrotic, and other materials. The combination between <b>housing</b> <b>plating</b> and apex and side seals materials was determined experimentally, to obtain the best duration of both seals and housing cover. For the shaft, steel alloys with little deformation on load are preferred, the use of Maraging steel has been proposed for this.|$|R

After consideration of many alternatives, a system of three identical latches at each of the three interface points was chosen.

40|$|DE 19833064 A UPAB: 20000320 NOVELTY - A {{high output}} voltage planar fuel cell, in which {{electrolyte}} membranes (20) cover cell interconnection structures in interspaces (Z) between individual cells. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A high output voltage fuel cell comprises a flat arrangement {{of at least}} two individual cells having an electrolyte membrane (20) coated with anode and cathode electrodes (21). The membranes (20) of adjacent cells extend into the interspace (Z) between individual cells where they overlap one another and tightly cover each side of the cell interconnection structure (22) which is impermeable to fuel in its plane within the interspace. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a fuel cell battery comprising a stack of the above planar fuel cells separated by intermediate <b>housing</b> <b>plates,</b> the first and last planar fuel cells being closed by <b>housing</b> end <b>plates.</b> Preferred Features: The cell housing (24) contacts both membranes (20) under pressure within the interspace (Z), a seal (23) being positioned between the housing and each membrane. The interconnection structure (22) comprises flat foils or perforated and/or expanded sheets, especially of special steel or titanium, or woven fabric, paper or fleece of carbon and/or metal. The electrolyte membrane (20) consists of a cation exchange membrane which is resistant to hydrolysis, oxidation and hydrogen or methanol. An electrically nonconductive foil may be located between the interconnection structure (22) and each membrane (20) within the interspace and the interconnection structure may be coated with an inert material, especially a polymer, within the interspace. USE - As a high output voltage fuel cell useful for small electrical equipment such as portable computers. ADVANTAGE - The fuel cell has a very compact, modular, planar construction and ensures a gas-tight electrical connection between the anode and cathode sides of the individual cells...|$|R
