5|$|All {{copernicium}} isotopes {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; in general, heavier isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable isotope, 285Cn, has a half-life of 29seconds; 283Cn has a half-life of 4seconds, and the unconfirmed 286Cn has a half-life of about 8.45seconds. Other isotopes have half-lives shorter than 0.1seconds. 281Cn and 284Cn both have half-lives of 97ms, {{and the other two}} isotopes have half-lives slightly under one millisecond. It is predicted that the heavy isotopes 291Cn and 293Cn may have half-lives longer than a few <b>decades,</b> <b>and</b> may have been produced in the r-process and be detectable in cosmic rays, though they would be about 10−12 times as abundant as lead.|$|E
