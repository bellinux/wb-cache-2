These indicators provide early warning signals about the manifestation of these risks, giving policymakers the opportunity to adjust policies before extreme fiscal stress events. Two aggregate indices are calculated: an index of fiscal vulnerability and an index of fiscal stress. Results show that both indices are elevated for advanced economies, reflecting unfavorable medium-term debt dynamics and aging-related spending pressures. In emerging economies, solvency risks are lower, but the composition of public debt remains a source of risk and the fiscal position is weaker than before the crisis.

This paper addresses four questions: What are the fiscal causes of crises? Which fiscal vulnerability indicators help to predict crises? Can fiscal variables explain the severity of crises? And what are the fiscal consequences of crises? Its findings are based on statistical analysis of a large data set of fiscal variables for 29 emerging market economies over 1970 - 2000 and detailed case studies of 11 emerging market crises during the 1990 s that focus on structural and institutional dimensions of fiscal vulnerability.

40|$|This paper applies {{stochastic}} simulation {{methods to}} assess debt sustainability in emerging market economies and provide probability measures for {{projections of the}} external and public debt burden over the medium term. The vulnerability of public debt to adverse shocks is determined {{by a number of}} interrelated factors, including the volatility of output, financial fragility, the endogenous response of the risk premium, and sudden stops in private capital flows. The vulnerability of external debt is sensitive to the determination of the exchange rate and to the pricing of traded goods. We show that fiscal policy can act in a preemptive manner to prevent the debt burden from rising significantly over the medium term. This requires flexibility in fiscal planning, which many emerging market economies lack. Emerging market economies therefore face a difficult trade-off between managing the risk of a debt crisis and pursuing other important <b>fiscal</b> policy objectives. <b>Debt</b> sustainability;Emerging markets;Risk premium;Fiscal management;Capital flows;Economic models;public debt, external debt, debt burden, current account, primary fiscal balance, <b>fiscal</b> balance, <b>debt</b> service, <b>fiscal</b> policy, external <b>debt</b> burden, domestic currency, <b>fiscal</b> authority, <b>debt</b> service payments, <b>debt</b> burdens, <b>fiscal</b> policy rules, <b>fiscal</b> planning, <b>debt</b> crises, debt default, <b>debt</b> obligations, <b>fiscal</b> policy rule, <b>debt</b> intolerance, aggregate demand, debt crisis, budget balance, domestic debt, sovereign debt, currency crises, <b>debt</b> management, <b>fiscal</b> sustainability, <b>debt</b> dynamics, <b>fiscal</b> constraint, fiscal effort, fiscal developments, current account deficit, fiscal authorities, <b>fiscal</b> risk, <b>debt</b> accumulation, <b>fiscal</b> policy objectives, fiscal rule, balance of payment, current account balance, fiscal expenditures, account deficits, tax revenues, current account deficits, current account adjustment, fiscal constraints, current account adjustments, current account balances, foreign <b>debt,</b> <b>fiscal</b> adjustment, <b>debt</b> defaults, sovereign <b>debt</b> crises, <b>fiscal</b> variables, <b>debt</b> structure, sustainable <b>fiscal</b> policy, fiscal imbalances, level of <b>debt</b> service, <b>fiscal</b> surplus, reserve management, <b>fiscal</b> revenues, national <b>debt,</b> debtor reporting system, <b>fiscal</b> policy trade, <b>debt</b> rescheduling, <b>fiscal</b> vulnerability, fiscal policy response, <b>fiscal</b> balances, external <b>debt</b> sustainability, debtor reporting, sovereign defaults, balance sheet effects, debt stocks, taxes on growth, fiscal rules, increase in <b>debt</b> service, primary <b>fiscal</b> deficit, fiscal commitments, budget deficit, sovereign default, domestic <b>debt</b> markets, <b>fiscal</b> solvency, fiscal outlook, cyclical <b>fiscal</b> policy, market <b>debt,</b> tax rates, sovereign bond, maturity structure of debt, liquidity crisis, public debt crisis, external debt burdens, government budget, liquidity crises, serial defaulters, fiscal plan...|$|R

40|$|This paper empirically explores how {{fiscal policy}} (represented by {{increases}} in government spending) has asymmetric effects {{on economic activity}} {{at different levels of}} real interest rates. It suggests that the effect of fiscal policy depends on the level of real rates, since the Ricardian effect is smaller at lower financing costs of fiscal policy. Using threshold regression models on U. S. data, the paper provides new evidence that expansionary government spending is more conducive to short-run growth when real rates are low. It also finds asymmetric effects on interest rates and inflation, and threshold effects associated with substitution between financing methods.

This is studied by comparing the change in the <b>fiscal</b> <b>debt</b> of GDP when the fiscal policy is used to stimulate the economy, with the case that the government does not stimulate. The increase in the economic growth that is achieved by the fiscal stimulus, which is a one per cent increase in the government spending of GDP, is measured by the fiscal multiplier. The fiscal multiplier is estimated in the period 2004 Q 1 - 2015 Q 2 using the estimation sample that consist of the European countries: France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Slovenia and Finland. Also, it is examined what is the economic growth that is needed in the countries to achieve an improvement in the fiscal budget deficits from the year 2014 level, a one per cent fiscal surplus of GDP {{by the end of the}} year 2019. The differences between countries in the size of the fiscal budget deficits sets the countries in different positions in the capability to achieve the economic growth that also would lead to the targeted improvement in the fiscal budgets.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} fiscal policy {{framework}} we call Public Debt Targeting. The framework seeks to smooth primary spending over {{the business cycle}} while remaining consistent with public debt sustainability. Under the proposed framework, a government announces a commitment to a public debt band trajectory over the medium term, while sequentially announcing primary expenditures for the next budget cycle, which are determined recursively based {{on the history of}} shocks. Public debt targeting differs from a structural balance rule in that it internalizes the effect of the deterioration in creditworthiness from fiscal deficits and public debt accumulation, which tend to affect sovereign spreads, interest rates, exchange rates, and economic activity. The proposed framework is applied to Caribbean economies, which in general show high levels of public debt and procyclical primary expenditure.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a new index which provides early warning signals of fiscal sustainability problems for advanced and emerging economies. Unlike previous studies, the index assesses {{the determinants of}} fiscal stress periods, covering public debt default as well as near-default events. The fiscal stress index depends on a parsimonious set of fiscal indicators, aggregated using the approach proposed by Kaminsky, Lizondo and Reinhart (1998). The index is {{used to assess the}} build up of fiscal stress over time since the mid- 1990 s in advanced and emering economies. Fiscal stress has increased recently to record-high levels in advanced countries, reflecting raising solvency risks and financing needs. In emerging economies, risks are lower than in mature economies owing to sounder fiscal fundamentals, but fiscal stress remains higher than before the crisis.

Generally, there are three important steps to sustainable pension reform: a change of pension indexation, a raised retirement age, and the launch of a fully funded (second) pillar. With regard to <b>fiscal</b> <b>debt,</b> the two-pillar system is superior to the pay-as-you-go system in the long term. Having considered the risk of returns on savings in the funded pillar, the authors show that while pensions under the two-pillar system should be higher than under a one-pillar system, it is not a certainty. pension reform; Slovakia; fiscal debt; pension level; asset returns; risk...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the experience of}} 99 advanced and developing economies in restoring fiscal sustainability during 1980 - 2008 after banking crises, which led to large accumulation of public debt. It finds that successful debt reductions have relied chiefly on generation of large primary surpluses in post-crisis years through current expenditure cuts. These savings have been accompanied by growth-promoting measures and a supportive monetary policy stance. While these {{results are consistent with}} the existing literature, the paper finds that revenue-raising measures increased the likelihood of successful consolidation in countries that faced large adjustment needs after the crisis. This reflects the fall in effectiveness of spending cuts when deficit reduction needs are large independent of initial tax ratios.

40|$|Using a new fiscal dataset {{for small}} states, this paper {{analyzes}} {{the link between}} country size, government size, debt, and economic performance. It finds that on average small states have larger governments and higher public debt. Although there are intrinsic factors that explain why governments are bigger in small states, those with smaller governments and lower public debt tend to grow faster and are less vulnerable. Large fiscal adjustments, primarily through expenditure restraint, can underpin growth, although sometimes other elements can also impact. Since better governance is associated with lower <b>debt,</b> <b>fiscal</b> adjustment should be supported by governance improvements.

We develop a model with free choice of distinct rent-seeking groups to cooperate (or not) in providing public goods, in seeking rents, and in austere debt issuing through international markets. Noncooperation of rent-seeking groups on fiscal prudence triggers collective fiscal impatience: <b>fiscal</b> <b>debt</b> is issued excessively because each group expropriates extra rents before other groups do so, too. Such collective fiscal impatience leads to a vicious circle of high international interest rates and external-debt default. Our calibration suggests that debt-GDP ratios below 137 % foster cooperation among rent-seeking groups, which avoids collective fiscal impatience and default.
