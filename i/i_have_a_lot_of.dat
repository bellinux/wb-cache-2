5|$|Hopsin {{detailed}} the album to The Source saying, There's {{a variety of}} music on there. There's crazy, wild lyrics. There's sad, emotional lyrics and even funny lyrics. I got serious songs and sad songs. Just a big variety of everything. I wanted to show the full me. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people who love me, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> haters as well. There are at least one or two songs for someone that doesn't really like me or what I put out. I think they'll stumble across a couple songs that will make them go, oh ok, I fucks with him now. I kinda wanted to make an album to show my wide range of music that I can do. I just wanted to show the full me.|$|E
500|$|Moore, {{a native}} of Lake Bluff, Illinois, {{frequently}} visited his father in Orlando following his parents' divorce. The two often spent time together at Walt Disney World nearby. [...] "It was a special, physical place, and it became an emotional space," [...] he told Filmmaker. [...] "Obviously, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> father issues that I can't separate from that place." [...] Later, their relationship deteriorated.|$|E
500|$|I did Winnie Winkle for 20 years, {{and when}} they told me, [...] "You have 90 days to wrap it up," [...] because they were discontinuing it, I felt terrible, but after I {{finished}} it, I didn't even miss it. I was depressed because I lost a good job, but I just didn't miss it. Maybe it was the routine of it every week I didn't miss, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> good memories of doing that strip.|$|E

5000|$|... "Stacked Actors is a {{response}} to living in Hollywood for {{about a year and a}} half, and my disdain and disgust of everything plastic and phony, which is the foundation of that city. And I just hated it. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of fun, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of fun hating it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About eleven o'clock. I hope it's all right. <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> {{delivered}} the letters myself, only <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of work to}} do." ...|$|R
500|$|When {{posed the}} film's central question, can {{men and women}} just be friends, Ryan replied, [...] "Yes, men and women can just be friends. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> platonic (male) friends, and sex doesn't get in the way." [...] Crystal said, [...] "I'm a little more optimistic than Harry. But I think it is difficult. Men {{basically}} act like stray dogs {{in front of a}} supermarket. I do have platonic (women) friends, but not best, best, best friends." ...|$|E
500|$|Nick is {{an awesome}} producer. He {{really helped me}} get the plan and have {{confidence}} in the decisions that we made. For me, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> ideas and sometimes it just comes down to [...] "OK, everything that I'm doing I have two options!" [...] He's awesome, because as I'm doing these things I'm asking him from the vocal booth or the piano room or whatever, [...] "Which one of these should I do?" [...] He's good at helping me make a quick decision. I really trust his opinion because he makes great records.|$|E
500|$|On January 12, 2011, {{composer}} Alan Menken {{was asked}} about the sequel in an interview. His reply was, [...] "I’ve heard things but there's nothing yet. I don’t know much about what’s happening with that. Honestly, I don’t know what the studio wants to do next. I presume there will be some future projects for me to work on. I love doing that, I really do. But I’m not frustrated that it isn’t one of them. At the moment <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> stage things happening and I’m busy enough with that, so I really don’t need more on my plate." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} with Kerrang! on {{a selection of}} the band's singles, Nicholas expressed his annoyance with comparisons between Coldplay and the album Pushing the Senses; he said that those comparisons were only made because he played a piano {{on many of the}} tracks that were on the album. In a 2011 {{interview with}} Cambridge-based webzine The Tab, he elaborated on his position regarding these comparisons, saying, [...] "Feeder have a much broader music dynamic musically, and we are a much heavier band, both live and on record. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> respect for Coldplay and we have toured with them, but we are two totally different bands, both dynamically and musically. I just think it's lazy journalism." ...|$|E
500|$|According to BBC {{reporter}} Fernando Ravsberg, who interviewed Sánchez on Monday, November 9, 2009, {{he did not}} see bruises, marks or {{scars on}} her body. When asked, she explained, [...] "Throughout the weekend I had a swollen cheekbone and eyebrow. Above all <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> pain in the lower back." [...] She still had marks on her buttocks however, which she couldn't show to the reporter. She attributed that to the [...] "skill of her captors". When CNN's David Ariosto reported on the incident, after Sánchez was injured but before she met with the BBC reporter, Sánchez is shown in video footage with bruising and swelling around her left eye and bruising on her arm. [...] The video report appeared on CNN Espanol on Monday, November 9, 2009.|$|E
500|$|Throughout 2016, PewDiePie's video style change {{became more}} {{apparent}} than the tweaks he implemented in the past (see above for more). As aforementioned, PewDiePie addressed his use of words such as gay as a pejorative, retrospectively expressing, [...] "I still make kinda stupid jokes that I shouldn't make. But I feel like back then I didn't understand. I was so immature and I just thought things were funny just because they were offensive [...] I'm not proud of it. I'm really not. But I'm also glad that I've grown past it." [...] While continuing to produce fewer Let's Play videos about horror games, his style of humour also changed; PewDiePie commented in a December 2016 video, [...] "I think {{the thing is that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> younger audience , and I think my humour got drier, and they don't get it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Sarelli, [...] "but {{it is no}} good {{going to}} bed--let us talk. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to say--it is {{pleasant}} to talk to anarchists at times." ...|$|R
5000|$|Chief Justice Alberto Piedra {{interrupted}} at {{this point}} in the story, and declared a recess. [...] "Yes, because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> left. <b>I</b> need about 10 days," [...] said Trimarco.|$|R
5000|$|David also {{commented that}} the album title could be looked at in two {{different}} ways: [...] "On the one hand, it's coming across like I'm arrogant. On the other hand, it's saying <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more composure on the album."" ...|$|R
500|$|Straczynski {{surprised}} many when he publicly revealed: [...] "There's a {{lot that}} I don't agree with, and I made this very clear to everybody within shouting distance at Marvel, especially Joe Quesada... {{there was a point}} where I made the decision, and told Joe, that I was going to take my name off the last two issues of the OMD arc. Eventually, Joe talked me out of that decision because {{at the end of the}} day, I don't want to sabotage Joe or Marvel, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> respect for both of those." [...] Quesada explained this disagreement with Straczynski, stating that their rift was primarily over the [...] "methodology" [...] of how to erase Peter and Mary Jane's marriage, but Straczynski was on board with the editorial mandate of undoing the Parkers' marriage.|$|E
500|$|Years later, {{reflecting}} on his tenure with the Royals, Affeldt said, [...] "I was pretty frustrated. I wanted to quit. I didn't {{want to go}} to the ballpark. I was just failing a lot. I was getting hurt. I didn't understand my role. I bounced around and I just didn't enjoy the game." [...] At the trade deadline on July 31, Affeldt was traded along with Denny Bautista to the Colorado Rockies for Ryan Shealy and Scott Dohmann. [...] Affeldt recalled, [...] "When [...] traded me, he said, 'I feel like I need to give you a fresh start. You can learn to enjoy the game again.' [...] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> respect for him now because he saw that. It was a move that had to be made for me to be able to continue playing baseball. I'm very thankful for it." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite this, the duo {{have not}} staged a {{full-scale}} tour or performed shows since 2010. Garfunkel confirmed to Rolling Stone in 2014 {{that he believes}} they will tour in the future, although Simon had been too [...] "busy" [...] in recent years. [...] "I know that audiences {{all over the world}} like Simon and Garfunkel. I'm with them. But I don't think Paul Simon's with them," [...] he remarked. In a 2016 interview with NPR's David Greene, when asked about the possibility of reuniting, Simon stated; [...] "Well, I don't think most people do [...] The fact is, is, like, we did do two big reunions, and we're done. There's nothing really much to say. You know, the music essentially stopped in 1970. [...] And, you know, I mean, quite honestly, we don't get along. So it's not like it's fun. If it was fun, I'd say, OK, sometimes we'll go out and sing old songs in harmony. That's cool. But when it's not fun, you know, and you're {{going to be in a}} tense situation, well, then <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> musical areas that I like to play in. So that'll never happen again. That's that." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1994, Science Fiction Chronicles Don D'Ammassa {{reviewed}} {{the novel as}} [...] "Okay, these aren't great art, but for all its simple mindedness, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more fun in this universe than in the one created by Star Trek." ...|$|R
5000|$|Director Budd Boetticher {{later called}} Rosenberg his [...] "favorite {{producer}} {{of all time}} {{because he was so}} damn honest. … He and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of arguments because we both wanted to make better pictures than Universal wanted us to make." ...|$|R
50|$|The station {{chose to}} keep its digital on channel 2 in the first-round digital channel election, but {{requested}} channel 6 in the third round. This is because the low VHF (band <b>I)</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of RF noise, which is worst on the lowest channels.|$|R
500|$|In the clay-court season, del Potro was {{eliminated}} {{in the second}} round of the Monte Carlo Masters by Ivan Ljubičić. In Rome, del Potro beat Victor Troicki and Wawrinka to advance to the quarterfinals, where he was defeated by defending champion Djokovic in straight sets. This meant del Potro's head-to-head record with the Serb was now 0–3. Del Potro then played at the 2009 Madrid Masters. After defeating Murray for the first time in the quarterfinals, he lost to Federer in the semifinals. At the French Open, where he was fifth seed, del Potro defeated Michaël Llodra, Troicki, Andreev, and ninth seed Tsonga en route to the quarterfinals. He then defeated three-time former quarterfinalist Tommy Robredo to get to his first semifinal of a Grand Slam. He was defeated in a close semifinal, where he was leading by a set twice, by eventual champion Federer who, after their match, said: [...] " [...] is young and strong, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> respect for him." [...] Prior to this encounter, del Potro had never taken a set from Federer in their five previous career meetings.|$|E
500|$|Gangsta rap {{has been}} criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang {{violence}} and black-on-black crime. The Gangsta rappers responded that they were simply describing the realities of life in places such as Compton, California, and Long Beach, California. Describing Doggystyle in 1993, Snoop Doggy Dogg likewise points to the album's realism, {{and the extent to which}} it is based on his personal experience. [...] He said, [...] "I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." [...] Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many young black men, and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. [...] "For little kids growing up in the ghettos," [...] he said, [...] "it's easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I've seen what that was like, and I don't glorify it, but I don't preach. I bring it to them rather than have them go find out about it for themselves." [...] He further explained the [...] "dream" [...] that he would pursue after making the album: [...] "I'm going to try to eliminate the gang violence. I'll be on a mission for peace. I know <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> power. I know if I say, 'Don't kill', niggas won't kill".|$|E
500|$|In September 2005, {{the paper}} decided to begin subscription-based service for daily columns {{in a program}} known as TimesSelect, which {{encompassed}} many previously free columns. Until being discontinued two years later, TimesSelect cost $7.95 per month or $49.95 per year, though it was free for print copy subscribers and university students and faculty. To avoid this charge, bloggers often reposted TimesSelect material, {{and at least one}} site once compiled links of reprinted material. On September 17, 2007, The New York Times announced that it would stop charging for access to parts of its Web site, effective at midnight the following day, reflecting a growing view in the industry that subscription fees cannot outweigh the potential ad revenue from increased traffic on a free site. In addition to opening almost the entire site to all readers, The New York Times news archives from 1987 to the present are available at no charge, as well as those from 1851 to 1922, which are in the public domain. Access to the Premium Crosswords section continues to require either home delivery or a subscription for $6.95 per month or $39.95 per year. Times columnists including Nicholas Kristof and Thomas Friedman had criticized TimesSelect, with Friedman {{going so far as to}} say [...] "I hate it. It pains me enormously because it's cut me off from a lot, a lot of people, especially because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people reading me overseas, like in India ... I feel totally cut off from my audience." ...|$|E

"That's true, an' {{the people}} about think it's worth {{two or three}} hundred, for you see <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> o' cheap jewellery, {{and some of the}} {{inquisitive}} ones have been trying to pump me of late.

2500|$|Not {{long after}} winning the championship, Pierce was asked, [...] "Is Kobe [...] really {{the best player in}} the world?" [...] Pierce responded by saying, [...] "I don't think Kobe is the best player. I'm the best player. There's a line that {{separates}} having confidence and being conceited. I don't cross that line but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> confidence in myself." [...] The quote drew minor controversy.|$|E
2500|$|At {{around the}} same time, {{long-term}} manager Bruce Findlay was fired {{and over the next}} few years the band gradually altered to the point where it was a shifting set of musicians around the only remaining core members, Kerr and Burchill. MacNeil has commented [...] "After I left, everything kind of went, and Bruce fell into that bracket of upheaval. I don't think he deserved it and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> sympathy for him after the way he was treated." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{fans have}} speculated that this song was a tribute to Grohl's {{deceased}} friend and bandmate, Kurt Cobain. However, in Grohl's own words, the song is, [...] "(his) {{way of saying that}} when I was young, I didn't have big rock heroes, I didn't want to grow up and be some big sporting hero. My heroes were ordinary people and the people that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> respect for are just solid everyday people - people you can rely on." [...] This was the third single to be released from the album.|$|E
