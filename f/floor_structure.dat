5|$|In 1892 Gaudí was {{commissioned}} by Claudio López Bru, second Marquis of Comillas, with the Franciscana Catholic Missions {{for the city of}} Tangier, in Morocco (at the time a Spanish colony). The project included a church, hospital and school, and Gaudí conceived a quadrilobulate ground-plan <b>floor</b> <b>structure,</b> with catenary arches, parabolic towers, and hyperboloid windows. Gaudí deeply regretted the project's eventual demise, always keeping his design with him. In spite of this, the project influenced the works of the Sagrada Família, in particular the design of the towers, with their paraboloid shape like those of the Missions.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} woodland, {{a former}} Forestry Commission plantation, planted around 1960 in the {{north-eastern}} corner of the park on a small hill, which contains a circular folly tower, of three storeys, in the centre. The tower, built from red sandstone, is believed to date to the late 18th century. The northern side is considerably more eroded by the weather than the southern side. The tower is marginally wider at the base and has no internal <b>floor</b> <b>structure,</b> but contains holes for floor joists and stair treads. There are four windows on the ground floors and narrower windows higher up.|$|E

40|$|A {{structural}} fire safety design method for composite steel-concrete slim <b>floor</b> <b>structures</b> was developed, including {{the characterization of}} fully-developed compartment fire curves and the equivalent fire exposure, temperature analysis of the composite structures, and the structural response analysis of composite slim <b>floor</b> <b>structures</b> subjected to fire. Special interest {{was given to the}} structural responses of the slim floor beam both as an isolated member and a part of the frame structure. The mechanical interaction behind the global deformation response of the frame was emphasized. Although the analyzed objects concentrated on composite slim <b>floor</b> <b>structures,</b> the according fire safety design method and the explored structural response mechanism in fire are equally applicable to other types of building structures. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a graphical {{method of analysis}} for preliminary design of horizontally loaded tall buildings which are laterally supported by vertical trussed frames and horizontal off-set riggers which {{are located in the}} exterior or facade skeletal frame structures {{in the direction of the}} lateral loading. The interaction between the trussed frames and these facade riggers is through the two <b>floor</b> <b>structures</b> adjacent to the top and bottom cords of the riggers. The method of analysis requires the calculation of seven planar stiffness parameters: bending and shear stiffness of the vertical trussed frames, the horizontal off-set riggers and the <b>floor</b> <b>structures</b> in addition to the bending stiffness of the exterior skeletal frame structures which support the riggers. The method allows a graphical procedure for obtaining the optimum level of the facade riggers in addition to a rapid assessment of the influence of the <b>floor</b> <b>structures</b> and facade riggers on the performance of the high-rise structure such as the reduction in lateral deflection at the top and the overturning moment at the base of the trussed frames...|$|R
25|$|As soon as two {{adjacent}} columns {{had been}} erected, a girder was hoisted into place {{between them and}} bolted onto the connectors. The columns were erected in opposite pairs, then two more girders were connected to form a self-supporting square—this was the basic frame of each module. The shears would then be moved along and an adjoining bay constructed. When a reasonable number of bays had been completed, the columns for the upper floor were erected (longer shear-legs were used for this, but the operation was {{essentially the same as}} for the ground floor). Once the ground <b>floor</b> <b>structure</b> was complete, the final assembly of the upper floor followed rapidly.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{numerous}} airframe modifications available: a cargo conversion for the 90 model, the CargoLiner, which replaces {{the rear door}} with a large pallet accessible cargo door, a heavy duty <b>floor</b> <b>structure</b> and cabin cargo liner, also a crew hatch for cockpit access for the crew in the 90, 100, and 200; a Wing Front Spar Reinforcement Kit for both 90 and 100 Series aircraft,; a modification for the entire King Air line that entails reworking and extending the nose to house a baggage compartment {{as well as the}} avionics normally found in the noses of King Air aircraft. Modifications available for the King Air 100 include a belly cargo pod similar to those fitted to the Beech 99 and the Model 1300 version of the King Air 200 series.|$|E
25|$|In particular, FRP rods {{are useful}} for {{structures}} where the presence of steel would not be acceptable. For example, MRI machines have huge magnets, and accordingly require non-magnetic buildings. Again, toll booths that read radio tags need reinforced concrete that is transparent to radio waves. Also, where the design life of the concrete structure {{is more important than}} its initial costs, non-steel reinforcing often has its advantages where corrosion of reinforcing steel is a major cause of failure. In such situations corrosion-proof reinforcing can extend a structure's life substantially, for example in the intertidal zone. FRP rods may also be useful in situations where {{it is likely that the}} concrete structure may be compromised in future years, for example the edges of balconies when balustrades are replaced, and bathroom floors in multi-story construction where the service life of the <b>floor</b> <b>structure</b> is likely to be many times the service life of the waterproofing building membrane.|$|E

40|$|Human-induced {{changes to}} {{habitats}} can have deleterious effects on many species that occupy them. However, some species can adapt and even benefit from such modifications. Artificial reefs {{have long been}} used to provide habitat for invertebrate communities and pro-mote local fish populations. With the increasing demand for energy resources within ocean systems, {{there has been an}} expansion of infrastructure in near-shore benthic environments which function as de facto artificial reefs. Little is known of their use by marine mammals. In this study, the influence of anthropogenic sea <b>floor</b> <b>structures</b> (pipelines, cable routes, wells and shipwrecks) on the foraging locations of 36 adult female Australian fur seals (Arctoce-phalus pusillus doriferus) was investigated. For 9 (25 %) of the individuals, distance to anthropogenic sea <b>floor</b> <b>structures</b> was {{the most important factor in}} determining the location of intensive foraging activity. Whereas the influence of anthropogenic sea <b>floor</b> <b>structures</b> on foraging locations was not related to age and mass, it was positively related to flipper length/standard length (a factor which can affect manoeuvrability).

40|$|Floor {{vibrations}} {{induced by}} human walking were investigated in a reinforced concrete <b>structure.</b> Six experimental <b>floor</b> <b>structures</b> {{were built in}} laboratories with the same dimensions and boundary conditions. Subjective tests were performed to assess the vibration serviceability of the <b>floor</b> <b>structures.</b> First, the {{subjects were asked to}} walk across a floor and then to rate the intensity of the vibrations, acceptability, and serviceability of the floors. In {{the second part of the}} tests, the subjects were seated on a chair placed in the middle of the floor and asked to rate floor vibrations when the walker passed the subjects. Floor vibrations induced by human walking were analyzed using peak acceleration, root mean square (r. m. s.) acceleration, and the vibration dose value (VDV), and four weighting functions (Wb, Wk, Wg, and Wm) were applied. Significant differences in the measured floor vibration were found across the <b>floor</b> <b>structures,</b> larger <b>floor</b> vibration lead to greater perceived vibration intensity, lower acceptability and serviceability.

2500|$|On {{the south}} bank {{in a field}} at Echline the {{remnants}} of a sunken <b>floor</b> <b>structure</b> with in situ floor deposits was found. The structure, based around an oval pit approximately 7 metres (23 ft) in length, contained the remains of a hearth, stone tools, and bone from a variety of animals. Radio-carbon analysis returned a date of c.8300, approximately 1000 years older than the northern site, making it the earliest known dwelling in Scotland. Additionally three isolated Neolithic pits and a Bronze Age pit group and pit alignment were identified.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1910, the {{interior}} of the house was damaged by fire, and was replaced with Queen Anne design elements.

2500|$|Structure 5 (also {{known as}} Palace 5) {{is the highest}} palace {{structure}} at Tamarindito. The palace's interior measured [...] {{and it had a}} vaulted roof. The interior contained only one or possibly two simple rooms without benches. The structure faced north and a single doorway has been uncovered in that side, although it is possible that a second doorway also existed in the north side. Unusually this meant that the building faced away from GroupA's Main Plaza. A wide stairway climbed the structure from the Plaza but it was necessary to walk around {{to the other side of}} the structure to gain access. The facade of Structure 5 overlooks Structure 7 immediately to the north. Investigations of the palace have discovered an earlier substructure [...] below a second stucco <b>floor.</b> <b>Structure</b> 5 may be the oldest structure in Group A.|$|E

40|$|The {{vibration}} serviceability of <b>flooring</b> <b>structures</b> {{has been}} of concern for decades. To date, design criteria classifying the dynamic behaviour {{of different types of}} timber <b>flooring</b> <b>structures</b> to an acceptable degree have not been well established. Parameters commonly used to investigate and assess vibrational performances of timber floors include natural frequencies, damping ratios, dynamic displacements, velocities, accelerations, mode shapes and static point load deflections. The damping ratio is also used for design purposes, but the value of damping ratio for design is controversial. This paper presents experimental evaluation of the damping ratios on full-scale timber flooring systems for different modes of vibration and details the variation in damping under different dead weights. The test results in this study highlight the need for further research in selecting appropriate values of damping parameters for design purposes. 1...|$|R

40|$|Floor {{vibrations}} {{induced by}} humans walking barefoot were investigated in heavyweight buildings. Six floating floors with different <b>floor</b> <b>structures</b> and thick resilient isolators {{were built in}} laboratories with the same dimensions and boundary conditions. Subjective tests were performed to assess the vibration serviceability of the <b>floor</b> <b>structures.</b> In the first test, {{subjects were asked to}} walk across a floor and then rate the intensity of the vibrations, and the acceptability and serviceability of the floors.

Floor vibrations induced by human walking were analysed using peak acceleration, root-mean-square (r. m. s.) acceleration, and the vibration dose value (VDV), with four frequency weighting functions (Wb, Wk, Wg, and Wm). Significant differences in the measured floor vibrations were found across the <b>floor</b> <b>structures</b> with greater <b>floor</b> vibration leading to greater perceived vibration intensity, lower acceptability, and lower serviceability. The VDV was correlated with perceptions of floor vibration when used with all four frequency weighting functions. The impact noise induced by walking did not influence subjective evaluations of floor vibration. A heavy/soft impact source (a standard impact source) provided a useful prediction of differences between the perception of the vibration on different floors. </p...|$|R

30|$|The South Korean Government has {{recognised}} {{the seriousness}} of such problems in apartment housing, and has begun imposing measures through the revision and enactment of laws (Ministry of Land 2015). As part of this effort, the government revised the ‘Criteria on the recognition and management of block <b>structures</b> for <b>floor</b> impact sounds in multi-dwelling houses’ in 2014.
