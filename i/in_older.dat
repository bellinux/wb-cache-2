5|$|According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the {{question}} of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed <b>in</b> <b>older</b> children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors <b>in</b> <b>older</b> children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines {{to such an extent that}} early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.|$|E

40|$|Background/Purpose: Measures {{to prevent}} the {{development}} of muscle mass decline should be initiated from midlife. However, the impact of physical activity at midlife on muscle mass <b>in</b> <b>old</b> age remains uncertain. The aim of this cross-sectional {{study was to determine}} whether physical activity at midlife influences muscle mass and physical performance <b>in</b> <b>old</b> age. Methods: A total of 272 Japanese women aged 65 years and <b>older</b> were enrolled <b>in</b> the study. Information about physical activity levels at midlife and <b>in</b> <b>old</b> age were collected using a retrospective questionnaire. We calculated the skeletal muscle mass index <b>in</b> <b>old</b> age and recorded the participants' walking speed and hand grip strength <b>in</b> <b>old</b> age. We then classified the participants into four groups according to their physical activity levels at midlife and <b>in</b> <b>old</b> age and conducted multiple linear regression analysis to determine whether the physical activity levels at midlife and <b>in</b> <b>old</b> age were associated with skeletal muscle mass index and physical performance <b>in</b> <b>old</b> age. Results: The participants in the groups that were physically inactive at midlife had a significantly lower skeletal muscle mass index <b>in</b> <b>old</b> age than those who were physically active at midlife (p <  0. 01). Participants in the groups that were physically inactive <b>in</b> <b>old</b> age also had significantly slower walking speeds at old age than those who were physically active (p <  0. 01). These associations remained significant after adjustment for age and body mass index. Conclusion: Physical activity at midlife may be associated with a higher muscle mass <b>in</b> <b>old</b> age and physical activity <b>in</b> <b>old</b> age may be associated with higher walking speeds <b>in</b> <b>old</b> age...|$|R

5|$|A {{group of}} 17people, {{initially}} considered missing, rode {{out the storm}} on the offshore Mackerel Island. Onshore, officials closed a portion of Highway 1 {{as well as other}} roads in the area. Ahead of the storm, hundreds of residents <b>in</b> <b>older</b> structures and mobile homes, as well as an aborigine village near Onslow, were ordered to evacuate to safer locations. Five iron mines were closed during the storm's passage, forcing the 1,500workers to return home. The disruptions from the cyclone affected about 340,000tonnes of lost production. About 800,000barrels of lost oil production resulted from closed offshore platforms. Oil fields reopened by 14April.|$|E

The changes in shape—leaves getting narrower and more robust {{from north to}} south and from lowland to montane—suggest adaptations to colder weather.|$|E

5|$|Both {{dogs and}} horses are {{susceptible}} to the gastrointestinal side effects associated with salicylates, {{but it is a}} convenient treatment for arthritis <b>in</b> <b>older</b> dogs, and has shown some promise in cases of laminitis in horses. It is no longer commonly used for cases of laminitis, as it could be counterproductive for treatment. Aspirin should be used in animals only under the direct supervision of a veterinarian; in particular, cats lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin, making it potentially toxic. No clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given 25mg/kg of aspirin every 48 hours for 4 weeks.|$|E

5|$|During {{the later}} nineteenth century, Megalosaurus {{was seen as}} the typical {{carnivorous}} dinosaur. If remains were found that were not deemed sufficiently distinct to warrant a separate genus, often single teeth, these were classified under Megalosaurus, which thus began to function as a wastebasket taxon, a sort of default genus. Eventually, Megalosaurus contained more species than any other non-avian dinosaur genus, most of them of dubious validity. During the twentieth century, this practice was gradually discontinued; but scientists discovering theropods that had been mistakenly classified under a different animal group <b>in</b> <b>older</b> literature, still felt themselves forced to rename them, again choosing Megalosaurus as the default generic name.|$|E
