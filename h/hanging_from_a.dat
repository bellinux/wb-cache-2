5|$|That night, Dark Heart's {{influence}} {{causes the}} other children to wreck the camp. The Bears and Cousins search for the Family members, before Dark Heart imprisons them—first in cages, then inside big rubies <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> chandelier. Meanwhile, John and Dawn tell Christy of their conviction to rescue the Family from the villain. Feeling guilty, she finally pays him back by admitting what she has done. Despite this, her bargain with Dark Heart is over.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging upside {{down from their}} feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way that}} allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.|$|E
5|$|Kono {{described}} Clock Tower as {{an experimental}} project {{with a small}} budget and staff. His peers believed that a game where the protagonist runs away from the enemy would not work, but he continued on despite these concerns. Due to lack of staffing resources, developer Human Entertainment could not include mouse support and also needed to shrink the map down significantly. Although the graphics are two-dimensional, the mansion is designed within a 3D space. The character graphics in Clock Tower were created by digitizing photographs of real people, a popular technique of the time. The actress for Jennifer was a woman in Human's planning division. Many of the motions in the game came from her acting, such as <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> roof and stumbling in the hallway.|$|E

5|$|Later, at FBI headquarters, Fox Mulder shows Dana Scully a {{photo of}} the missing loggers, telling her that another group of loggers {{disappeared}} in the forest in 1934. The two agents head to the forest, where they meet Park Ranger Larry Moore and Steve Humphreys, head of security for the logging company. While driving through the forest, their truck hits caltrops left in the ground by eco-terrorists, forcing them to walk the rest of the way. Upon arriving at the camp site, Mulder and Scully find the cabins abandoned and the communication equipment destroyed. Searching the forest, they find a corpse encased in a large cocoon <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> tree.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and a {{group of}} police search for Lewton's remains. Scully sees blood {{dripping}} on Mulder's face from above and, upon looking up, they see a portion of Lewton's intestine <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> tree. Scully, about to perform an autopsy on the intestine, is interrupted when Mona suddenly calls and reports that Bilac was under the influence of Yaje. At the museum, Mona hears noises from a restroom and, upon opening a toilet lid, she sees rats forcing {{their way out of the}} sewer. When the two agents arrive, they discover Bilac crying beside one of the toilets, saying that Mona is dead.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 2009, a {{photograph}} was taken at a DPJ rally for the House of Representatives election showing a banner that was <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> ceiling. The banner {{was made of}} two Hinomaru flags cut and sewn together to form {{the shape of the}} DPJ logo. This infuriated the LDP and Prime Minister Tarō Asō, saying this act was unforgivable. In response, DPJ President Yukio Hatoyama (who voted for the Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem) said that the banner was not the Hinomaru and should not be regarded as such.|$|E

5|$|The Mahabharata {{tells the}} story of Manasa's marriage. Sage Jagatkāru practised severe austerities and had decided to abstain from marriage. Once he came across a group of men <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> tree upside down. These men were his ancestors, who were doomed to misery as their {{children}} had not performed their last rites. So they advised Jagatkāru to marry and have a son who could free them of those miseries by performing the ceremonies. Vasuki offered his sister Manasa's hand to Jagatkāru. Manasa gave birth to a son, Astīka, who freed his ancestors. Astika also helped in saving the Nāga race from destruction when King Janamejaya decided to exterminate them by sacrificing them in his Yajna, fire offering.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} continues, {{and after}} the filming of a pool scene the crew gather in catering; Beeman discovers a severed finger in his sandwich, recognizing from its ring that it belonged to Niederman. When the sheriff shuts down production, Black theorizes that the killer may target the crew's hotel; he and Hollis arrive to find {{the body of the}} film's publicist <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> rope. The next day, a film extra (Gene Simmons) confesses to the killings; Black pokes holes in his story and discovers he is not a credible perpetrator. Regardless, production is resumed—and shortly afterwards, several crew members are found with their throats cut, while Winston's body hangs nearby in an apparent murder-suicide.|$|E
5|$|Maibaum {{may have}} thought the {{eventual}} oil-rig finale a poor substitute, but it was originally intended {{to be much more}} spectacular. Armed frogmen would jump from the helicopters into the sea and attach limpet mines to the rig's legs (this explains why frogmen appear on the movie's poster). Blofeld would have escaped in his BathoSub and Bond would have pursued him, <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> weather balloon. The chase would have continued across a salt mine, with the two mortal enemies scrambling over white hills of salt before Blofeld would fall to his death in a salt granulator. Permission was not granted by the owners of the salt mine. It also made the sequence too long. Further problems followed when the explosives set up for the finale were set off too early; fortunately, a handful of cameras were ready and able to capture the footage.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, Mina finds Hansel <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> tree. She {{takes him}} to a nearby spring where she heals his wounds and makes love to him. Gretel {{searches}} for Hansel in the forest, but is attacked by Sheriff Berringer and his posse. The men capture and beat Gretel before being stopped by Edward who kills the sheriff and his men. Edward tends Gretel's wounds and tells her that he helped her because trolls serve witches. Hansel and Gretel reunite at an abandoned cabin which they discover is both a witch's lair and their childhood home. Muriel appears in front of them, telling them the truth of their past. She reveals that Hansel and Gretel's mother was a grand white witch named Adrianna who married a farmer. On {{the night of the}} last Blood Moon, Muriel planned to use the heart of the white witch to complete her potion. She found Adrianna too powerful and decided to use Gretel's heart instead. To get rid of Adrianna, Muriel revealed to the townspeople that Adrianna was a witch. The resulting angry mob burned her alive and hanged Hansel and Gretel's father. Following this revelation, the siblings battle Muriel before she stabs Hansel and abducts Gretel for the ceremony.|$|E

25|$|In September 1918, a Finnish {{immigrant}} named Olli Kinkkonen was lynched in Duluth, allegedly for dodging {{military service}} in World War I, which the United States had recently entered.

Authorities did not pursue murder charges; they {{claimed that he}} had committed suicide after the shame of having been tarred and feathered.|$|E
25|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that it derives from the symbol used on a German Thaler. According to Ovason (2004), on one type of thaler one side showed a crucifix while the other showed a serpent <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> cross, the letters NU near the serpent's head, {{and on the other}} side of the cross the number 21. This refers to the Bible, Numbers, Chapter 21 (see Nehushtan).|$|E

5000|$|The {{definition}} of Quintana {{comes from the}} 5th road of the Roman military camps, where the soldiers were trained in lance fighting.

This is {{the origin of the}} tournament's name, but the first definition and documented [...] "Quintana" [...] as a knights' jousting tournament during a festival, dates back to 1448.

40|$|Background To provide {{body weight}} support during walking and balance training, one can employ two {{distinct}} embodiments: support through <b>a</b> harness <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> overhead system or support through a saddle/seat type. This paper presents {{a comparison of}} these two approaches. Ultimately, this comparison determined our selection of the body weight support system employed in the MIT-Skywalker, a robotic device developed for the rehabilitation/habilitation of gait and balance after a neurological injury. Method Here we will summarize our results with eight healthy subjects walking on the treadmill without any support, with 30 % unloading supported by <b>a</b> harness <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> overhead system, and with a saddle/seat-like support system. We compared the center of mass as well as vertical and mediolateral trunk displacements across different walking speeds and support. Results The bicycle/saddle system had the highest values for the mediolateral inclination, while the overhead harness body weight support showed the lowest values at all speeds. The differences were statistically significant. Conclusion We selected the bicycle/saddle system for the MIT-Skywalker. It allows faster don-and-doff, better centers the patient to the split treadmill, and allows all forms of training. The overhead harness body weight support might be adequate for rhythmic walking training but limits any potential for balance training...|$|R

25|$|On 9 May 1976, Ulrike Meinhof {{was found}} dead in her prison cell, <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> rope made from jail towels.

25|$|Each {{time the}} {{pendulum}} swings through its centre position, it releases one tooth of the escape wheel (g).
