The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) concentration is 10 ppm. Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes. The toxicity of chlorine comes from its oxidizing power. When chlorine is inhaled at concentrations greater than 30ppm, it reacts with water and cellular fluid, producing hydrochloric acid (HCl) and <b>hypochlorous</b> <b>acid</b> (HClO).|$|E

In this study, RAW 264. 7 macrophages treated with TauCl were protected from death caused by H 2 O 2. TauCl increased the expression of peroxiredoxin- 1, thioredoxin- 1 and heme oxygenase (HO) - 1, the anti-oxidant enzymes normally induced by activation of NF-E 2 -related factor- 2 (Nrf 2). TauCl increased nuclear translocation of Nrf 2 and binding to the anti-oxidant response element. These data suggest that TauCl produced abundantly in the activated neutrophils and released to surrounding cells in the inflamed tissues may induce the expression of cytoprotective anti-oxidant enzymes. Elevation of HO activity via induction of HO- 1 expression within neighboring cells may provide protection from cytotoxicity caused by inflammatory oxidants like H 2 O 2.

40|$|By {{combining}} {{easy and}} fast leukocyte enrichment with aminophenyl-fluorescein (APF) staining {{we developed a}} method to quickly and specifically address the halogenating activity of the immunological relevant blood heme peroxidases myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase, respectively. For leukocyte enrichment a two-fold hypotonic lysis procedure of the blood with Millipore water was chosen which represents a cheap, fast and reliable method to diminish the amount of erythrocytes in the samples. This procedure is shown to be suitable both to human and murine blood micro-samples, making it also applicable to small animal experiments with recurring blood sampling. As all types of leukocytes are kept in the sample during the preparation, they can be analysed separately after discrimination during the flow cytometry analysis. This also holds for all heme peroxidase-containing cells, namely neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes. Moreover additional parameters (e. g. antibody staining) can be combined with the heme peroxidase activity determination to gain additional information about the different immune cell types. Based on previous results we applied APF for specifically addressing the halogenating activity of leukocyte peroxidases in blood samples. This dye is selectively oxidized by the MPO and EPO halogenation products <b>hypochlorous</b> and hypobromous <b>acid.</b> This approach may provide a suitable tool to gain more insights into the immune-physiological role of the halogenating activity of heme peroxidases...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of several oxidation/reduction reactions of oxyhalogen species are presented. Bromine chloride (BrCl) catalyzes the decomposition of <b>hypochlorous</b> acid/hypobromous <b>acid</b> (HOCl/HOBr) mixtures. BrCl reacts with hypochlorite ion (OCl−) to form BrOCl, which hydrolyzes to chlorite (ClO 2 −) and bromide (Br −) ions. Bromite ion (BrO 2 −) is formed via HOBr disproportionation. Rapid reactions of HOCl/BrO 2 − and HOBr/ClO 2 − produce bromate (BrO 3 −) and chlorate (ClO 3 −) ions, respectively. The {{study of the}} HOCl/HOBr decomposition is enabled by the ion chromatography (IC). The preparation of HOCl/HOBr reaction mixtures for IC requires removal of HOCl and HOBr from the samples. Three dehalogenating species, phenol, 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, and sulfite ion, enable ion chromatographic analysis. The reduction of BrO 2 − by sulfite ion (k = 3. 0 × 107 M− 1 s− 1) occurs through the OBr + transfer reaction to sulfite ion, with subsequent general-acid catalyzed hydrolysis of OBrSO 3 −. Conversely, ClO 2 − does not react with sulfite, and the reaction is not general-acid catalyzed. Chlorite and S(IV) react via an oxygen-atom transfer where k(ClO 2 −/SO 2) = 6. 26 × 106 M− 1 s − 1 and k(ClO 2 −/SO 3 H−) = 5. 5 M− 1 s− 1. The reaction of HOBr with nitrite ion (NO 2 −) proceeds by a bromine-atom transfer reaction. HOBr, NO 2 −, and H+ are in equilibrium with nitryl bromide, BrNO 2 (K = 2. 73 × 108 M − 2). BrNO 2 is detected spectrophotometrically where 2 ̆ 6 epsiv;(260 nm) = 956 M− 1 cm− 1. BrNO 2 reacts rapidly with NO 2 − (k = 6. 9 × 103 M− 1 s− 1) to form Br− and N 2 O 4 and can dissociate to form NO 2 + and Br − (k = 18 s− 1). Rapid reactions of N 2 O 4 and NO 2 + with water produce NO 3 − as a final product. Nitrite levels above 100 mM cause a suppression of the observed rate constant. This suggests that N 2 O 4 hydrolysis occurs by reversible heterolytic dissociation into NO 2 + and NO 2 −. ...|$|R
40|$|Oxidized halogen antimicrobials, such as <b>hypochlorous</b> and hypobromous <b>acids,</b> {{have been}} used {{extensively}} for microbial control in industrial systems. Recent discoveries have shown that acylated homoserine lactone cell-to-cell signaling molecules are important for biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, suggesting that biofouling can be controlled by interfering with bacterial cell-to-cell communication. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the potential for oxidized halogens to react with acylated homoserine lactone-based signaling molecules. Acylated homoserine lactones containing a 3 -oxo group were found to rapidly react with oxidized halogens, while acylated homoserine lactones lacking the 3 -oxo functionality did not react. The Chromobacterium violaceum CV 026 bioassay was used {{to determine the effects of}} such reactions on acylated homoserine lactone activity. The results demonstrated that 3 -oxo acyl homoserine lactone activity was rapidly lost upon exposure to oxidized halogens; however, acylated homoserine lactones lacking the 3 -oxo group retained activity. Experiments with the marine alga Laminaria digitata demonstrated that natural haloperoxidase systems are capable of mediating the deactivation of acylated homoserine lactones. This may illustrate a natural defense mechanism to prevent biofouling on the surface of this marine alga. The Chromobacterium violaceum activity assay illustrates that reactions between 3 -oxo acylated homoserine lactone molecules and oxidized halogens do occur despite the presence of biofilm components at much greater concentrations. This work suggests that oxidized halogens may control biofilm not only via a cidal mechanism, but also by possibly interfering with 3 -oxo acylated homoserine lactone-based cell signaling...|$|R

WAHS was {{as effective as}} 70 % ethanol and diluted Purelox for 0. 5 -min reactions. For 0. 5 -min reactions {{in the presence of}} mouse feces emulsion, the efficacy of WHAS and 1 : 600 diluted Purelox was decreased, reducing the virus titers by 2. 3 and 2. 6 log 10, respectively, while 70 % ethanol reduced the titer by more than 5 log 10. However, WAHS showed more than 5 log 10 reductions for the 5 -min reaction even in the presence of feces emulsion. Since WAHS showed enough efficacy in inactivating MNV in vitro, we tried to eliminate MNV from MNV-infected mice by substituting WAHS for their drinking water. However, MNV was found to be positive in feces of mice drinking WAHS by an RT-nested PCR and plaque assay. To investigate whether hypochlorite-based disinfectants could prevent infection of a mouse with MNV, WAHS or 1 : 6, 000 diluted Purelox was substituted for the drinking water of mice for 2 or 4 weeks, and then the mice were placed in a cage with an MNV-infected mouse. The supply of disinfectants was continued after cohabitation, but MNV was detected in the feces of all the mice at 1 week after cohabitation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{protocol}} for the quick and standardized enrichment of leukocytes from small whole blood samples is described. This procedure {{is based on}} the hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes and can be applied to human samples as well as to blood of non-human origin. The small initial sample volume of about 50 to 100 µl makes this method applicable to recurrent blood sampling from small laboratory animals. Moreover, leukocyte enrichment is achieved within minutes and with low material efforts regarding chemicals and instrumentation, making this method applicable in multiple laboratory environments. Standardized purification of leukocytes is combined with a highly selective staining method to evaluate halogenating peroxidase activity of the heme peroxidases, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), i. e., the formation of <b>hypochlorous</b> and hypobromous <b>acid</b> (HOCl and HOBr). While MPO is strongly expressed in neutrophils, the most abundant immune cell type in human blood as well as in monocytes, the related enzyme EPO is exclusively expressed in eosinophils. The halogenating activity of these enzymes is addressed by using the almost HOCl- and HOBr-specific dye aminophenyl fluorescein (APF) and the primary peroxidase substrate hydrogen peroxide. Upon subsequent flow cytometry analysis all peroxidase-positive cells (neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils) are distinguishable and their halogenating peroxidase activity can be quantified. Since APF staining may be combined with the application of cell surface markers, this protocol can be extended to specifically address leukocyte sub-fractions. The method is applicable to detect HOCl and HOBr production both in human and in rodent leukocytes. Given the widely and diversely discussed immunological role of these enzymatic products in chronic inflammatory diseases, this protocol may contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the immunological relevance of leukocyte-derived heme peroxidases...|$|R

Successful biodegradation {{is one of the}} major factors defining the life span and biological responses to nanoparticles. Here, we review the role and contribution of different oxidative enzymes of inflammatory cells - myeloperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase, lactoperoxidase, hemoglobin, and xanthine oxidase - to the reactions of nanoparticle biodegradation. We further focus on interactions of nanomaterials with hemoproteins dependent on the specific features of their physico-chemical and structural characteristics. Mechanistically, we highlight the significance of immobilized peroxidase reactive intermediates vs diffusible small molecule oxidants (<b>hypochlorous</b> and hypobromous <b>acids)</b> for the overall oxidative biodegradation process in neutrophils and eosinophils. We also accentuate the importance of peroxynitrite-driven pathways realized in macrophages via the engagement of NADPH oxidase- and NO synthase-triggered oxidative mechanisms. We consider possible involvement of oxidative machinery of other professional phagocytes such as microglial cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, in the context of biodegradation relevant to targeted drug delivery. We evaluate the importance of genetic factors and their manipulations for the enzymatic biodegradation in vivo. Finally, we emphasize a novel type of biodegradation realized via the activation of the "dormant" peroxidase activity of hemoproteins by the nano-surface. This is exemplified by the binding of GO to cyt c causing the unfolding and 'unmasking' of the peroxidase activity of the latter. We conclude with the strategies leading to safe by design carbonaceous nanoparticles with optimized characteristics for mechanism-based targeted delivery and regulatable life-span of drugs in circulation.

WHO (2003) estimates that, in India, about 38 million people are affected by waterborne diseases through various means each year, among which over 75 % are children. So, disinfection of drinking water is essential to reduce the incidence and spread of waterborne diseases (Gaffga et al. 2007). The disinfection of metropolitan drinking water is performed with chlorine {{in order to ensure}} the health of the public and to protect the people against various waterborne infirmities (Villanueva et al. 2015). Chlorination is the most universally accepted method for disinfection since the early twentieth century (Paull and Barron 2004) as it prevents the contamination of potable water against pathogens like bacteria and viruses (Zha et al. 2014). In (1974), Rook first discovered that <b>hypochlorous</b> and hypobromous <b>acid</b> react with naturally present organic matter to form water DBPs, few trihalomethanes (THM) substances such as chloroform (CHCl 3), bromo dichloromethane (CHCl 2 Br), dibromo chloromethane (CHClBr 2) and bromoform (CHBr 3). Richardson (2002) reported that during the addition of chlorine to water, toxic compounds are formed and more than 600 DBPs were identified like haloacetic acids. DBPs are formed through the reaction of organic precursor (natural organic matter, algal organic matter, wastewater effluent organic matter) and inorganic substance (bromate, iodate and nitrate) and also on reaction with chemical disinfectants (chlorine, chlorine dioxide, chloramines and ozone) (Krasner 2009). NOM includes humic substances, fulvic acid, hydrophilic amino acids (Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln, His, Tyr), carboxylic acids and carbohydrates too (Kitis et al. 2001). The USEPA issued the DBPs rule that specifies that the highest TOC levels for treated water is 2 and 4  mg/L in source water to ensure that DBPs such as THMs are present at acceptable levels (Pontius 1993). Zeng et al. (2015) highlighted that the common genotoxic compounds come from raw water and several mutagenic or carcinogenic DBPs are formed due to addition of disinfectants to drinking water. Chorine- and bromine-containing compounds also cause carcinogenic, mutagenic or teratogenic effects on animal studies (Weisel et al. 1999). Zhai et al. (2014) reported that 2, 4, 6 -tribromoresorcinol, 2, 6 -dibromo- 4 -nitrophenol, 2, 2, 4 -tribromo- 5 -hydroxy- 4 -cyclopentene- 1, 3 -dione, 2, 2, 4 -dibro-mochloro- 5 -hydroxy- 4 -cyclopentene- 1, 3 -dione, and 2, 2, 4 -bromo-dichloro- 5 -hydroxy- 4 -cyclopentene- 1, 3 -dione are termed as polar brominated DBPs.|$|R

2500|$|Chlorine is a {{relatively}} common gas in industry {{with a variety of}} uses. It is used to disinfect water as well as being a part of the sanitation process for sewage and industrial waste. Chlorine is also used as a bleaching agent during the production of paper and cloth. Many household cleaning products, including bleach, contain chlorine. Given the volume and ease of chlorine for industrial and commercial use, exposure could occur from an accidental spill or a deliberate attack. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends that a person wear splash proof goggles, a face shield and a respirator mask when working in the vicinity of chlorine gas. Because chlorine is a gas at room temperature, most exposure occurs via inhalation. Exposure may also occur through skin or eye contact or by ingesting chlorine-contaminated food or water. Chlorine is a strong oxidizing element causing the hydrogen to split from water in moist tissue, resulting in nascent oxygen and hydrogen chloride that cause corrosive tissue damage. Additionally oxidation of chlorine may form <b>hypochlorous</b> <b>acid,</b> which can penetrate cells and react with cytoplasmic proteins destroying cell structure.
