25|$|This allowed Sommerfeld {{to generalize}} Bohr's theory of {{circular}} orbits to elliptical orbits, {{showing that the}} energy levels are the same. He also found some general properties of quantum angular momentum which seemed paradoxical at the time. One of these results was that the z-component of the angular momentum, the classical <b>inclination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>orbit</b> relative to the z-axis, could only take on discrete values, a result which seemed to contradict rotational invariance. This was called space quantization for a while, but this term fell out of favor with the new quantum mechanics since no quantization of space is involved.|$|E
5000|$|Launch sites {{at lower}} latitudes are often {{preferred}} partly for the flexibility they allow in orbital inclination; the initial <b>inclination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>orbit</b> is constrained {{to be greater}} than or equal to the launch latitude. Vehicles launched from Cape Canaveral, for instance, must have an initial orbital inclination of at least 28°27′, the latitude of the launch site—and to achieve this minimum requires launching with a due east azimuth, which may not always be feasible given other launch constraints. At the extremes, a launch site located on the equator can launch directly into any desired inclination, while a hypothetical launch site at the north or south pole would only be able to launch into polar orbits. (While it is possible to perform an orbital inclination change maneuver once on orbit, such maneuvers are typically among the most costly, in terms of fuel, of all orbital maneuvers, and are typically avoided or minimized to the extent possible.) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the spatial circular restricted three-body problem, on {{the motion of}} an infinitesimal body under the gravity of Sun and Earth. This can be described by a 3 -degree of freedom Hamiltonian system. We fix an energy level close {{to that of the}} collinear libration point L 1, located between Sun and Earth. Near L 1 there exists a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold, diffeomorphic to a 3 -sphere. For an orbit confined to this 3 -sphere, the amplitude of the motion relative to the ecliptic (the plane of the orbits of Sun and Earth) can vary only slightly. We show that we can obtain new orbits whose amplitude of motion relative to the ecliptic changes significantly, by following orbits of the flow restricted to the 3 -sphere alternatively with homoclinic orbits that turn around the Earth. We provide an abstract theorem for the existence of such ‘diffusing’ orbits, and numerical evidence that the premises of the theorem are satisfied in the three-body problem considered here. We provide an explicit construction of diffusing orbits. The geometric mechanism underlying this construction is reminiscent of the Arnold diffusion problem for Hamiltonian systems. Our argument, however, does not involve transition chains of tori as in the classical example of Arnold. We exploit mostly the ‘outer dynamics’ along homoclinic orbits, and use very little information on the ‘inner dynamics’ restricted to the 3 -sphere. As a possible application to astrodynamics, diffusing orbits as above can be used to design low cost maneuvers to change the <b>inclination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>orbit</b> of a satellite near L 1 from a nearly-planar orbit to a tilted orbit with respect to the ecliptic. We explore different energy levels, and estimate the largest orbital inclination that can be achieved through our construction. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|E
50|$|Orbital {{inclination}} change is an orbital maneuver aimed at changing the <b>inclination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>orbiting</b> body's orbit. This maneuver {{is also known}} as an orbital plane change as the plane of the orbit is tipped. This maneuver requires a change in the orbital velocity vector (delta v) at the orbital nodes (i.e. the point where the initial and desired orbits intersect, the line of orbital nodes is defined by the intersection of the two orbital planes).|$|R

We derive the observed perturbation to the intensity covariance map due to the object, showing that under some reasonable approximations it is proportional to the real part of the Fourier transform of the source's photon-flux density times the Fourier transform of the object's intensity absorption. We highlight the key parameters impacting its visibility and discuss the requirements for estimating object-related parameters, e. g., its size, velocity or shape.

40|$|We {{continue}} the study undertaken in Efroimsky (2005 a) where we explored {{the influence of}} spin-axis variations <b>of</b> <b>an</b> oblate planet on satellite orbits. Near-equatorial satellites had long been believed {{to keep up with}} the oblate primary's equator in the cause of its spin-axis variations. As demonstrated by Efroimsky and Goldreich (2004), this opinion had stemmed from <b>an</b> inexact interpretation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> correct result by Goldreich (1965). Though Goldreich (1965) mentioned that his result (preservation <b>of</b> the initial <b>inclination,</b> up to small oscillations about the moving equatorial plane) was obtained for non-osculating inclination, his admonition has been persistently ignored for forty years. It was explained in Efroimsky and Goldreich (2004) that the equator precession influences the osculating <b>inclination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> satellite <b>orbit</b> already in the first order over the perturbation caused by a transition from an inertial to an equatorial coordinate system. It was later shown in Efroimsky (2005 a) that the secular part <b>of</b> the <b>inclination</b> is affected only in the second order. This fact, anticipated by Goldreich (1965), remains valid for <b>a</b> constant rate <b>of</b> the precession. It turns out that non-uniform variations of the planetary spin state generate changes in the osculating elements, that are linear in the planetary equator's total precession rate, rate that includes the equinoctial precession, nutation, the Chandler wobble, and the polar wander. We work out a formalism which will help us to determine if these factors cause <b>a</b> drift <b>of</b> <b>a</b> satellite <b>orbit</b> away from the evolving planetary equator.

40|$|Uncovering the {{demographics}} of extrasolar planets is crucial to understanding the processes of their formation and evolution. In this thesis, we present four studies that contribute to this end, three of which relate to NASA's Kepler mission, which has revolutionized the field of exoplanets {{in the last few}} years. In the pre-Kepler study, we investigate <b>a</b> sample <b>of</b> exoplanet spin-orbit measurements [...] -measurements <b>of</b> the <b>inclination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> planet's <b>orbit</b> relative to the spin axis of its host star [...] -to determine whether a dominant planet migration channel can be identified, and at what confidence. Applying methods of Bayesian model comparison to distinguish between the predictions of several different migration models, we find that the data strongly favor a two-mode migration scenario combining planet-planet scattering and disk migration over a single-mode Kozai migration scenario. While we test only the predictions of particular Kozai and scattering migration models in this work, these methods may be used to test the predictions of any other spin-orbit misaligning mechanism. We then present two studies addressing astrophysical false positives in Kepler data. The Kepler mission has identified thousands of transiting planet candidates, and only relatively few have yet been dynamically confirmed as bona fide planets, with only a handful more even conceivably amenable to future dynamical confirmation. As a result, the ability to draw detailed conclusions about the diversity of exoplanet systems from Kepler detections relies critically on understanding the probability that any individual candidate might be a false positive. We show that a typical a priori false positive probability for a well-vetted Kepler candidate is only about 5 - 10...|$|R

Here we expand on earlier work by Strohmayer (2009) who used only <b>a</b> part <b>of</b> the present data set. Our primary results are: (1) the discovery of sharp, quasi-periodic, energy-independent dips in the X-ray intensity that recur on average every 243 days, (2) the detection <b>of</b> <b>an</b> energy-dependent (variability amplitude decreases with increasing energy), quasi-sinusoidal X-ray modulation with <b>a</b> period <b>of</b> 112. 6 ± 4 days the amplitude of which weakens {{during the second half}} of the light curve and (3) spectral evidence for an increase in photoelectric absorption during the last continuous segment of the data.

If correct, this implies that NGC 5408 X- 1 is in a binary with <b>an</b> orbital period <b>of</b> 243 ± 23 days, in contrast to the 115. 5 day quasi-sinusoidal period previously reported by Strohmayer (2009).
