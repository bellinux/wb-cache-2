5|$|The work {{to develop}} an {{adaptation}} of Shadowrun for the SNES by the Australian developer Beam Software began when Adam Lanceman, part of the company's management team, acquired the license for FASA's 1989 tabletop RPG. The project was initially headed by Gregg Barnett until <b>he</b> <b>abruptly</b> left Beam midway through the game's development to start Perfect Entertainment in the United Kingdom. The game's production was halted by Beam, but eventually resumed before its set deadline.|$|E
5|$|At the party, Veronica {{notices that}} the “rape coasters” which test for date rape drugs do not {{actually}} work. Veronica, Mac, and Piz test various peoples’ cups and find nothing. After Keith tells Dean O’Dell {{that his wife}} is cheating on him with Veronica’s criminology professor, {{he pulls out a}} gun. Wallace and Piz find a drink that was tested positive for GHB, and Wallace and Piz dash to her dorm. Dean O’Dell finds and enters into the room in which his wife and the criminology professor are carrying on their affair as Veronica learns that they have tracked the wrong girl. Just as Mercer (Ryan Devlin) (the actual rapist) is about to rape his next victim, <b>he</b> <b>abruptly</b> learns that Veronica has changed places with his victim. Veronica tases Mercer, and they have a quick fight before Veronica escapes. She is let into Moe’s (Andrew McClain) room.|$|E
5|$|Booth was {{strongly}} {{opposed to the}} abolitionists who sought to end slavery in the U.S. He attended the hanging of abolitionist leader John Brown on December 2, 1859, who was executed for leading a raid on the Federal armory at Harpers Ferry in present-day West Virginia. Booth had been rehearsing at the Richmond Theatre when <b>he</b> <b>abruptly</b> decided to join the Richmond Grays, a volunteer militia of 1,500men traveling to Charles Town for Brown's hanging, to guard against an attempt by abolitionists to rescue Brown from the gallows by force. When Brown was hanged without incident, Booth stood in uniform near the scaffold and afterwards expressed great satisfaction with Brown's fate, although he admired the condemned man's bravery in facing death stoically.|$|E

25|$|A 60-cigarette-per-day smoker, Johnson {{suffered}} a near-fatal heart attack on July 2, 1955. <b>He</b> <b>abruptly</b> gave up smoking as a result, {{with only a}} couple of exceptions, and did not resume the habit until he left the White House on January 20, 1969.|$|E
25|$|Regular {{visitors}} to the Pasternak's home also included Sergei Rachmaninoff, Alexander Scriabin, Lev Shestov, Rainer Maria Rilke. Pasternak aspired first to be a musician. Inspired by Scriabin, Pasternak briefly {{was a student at}} the Moscow Conservatory. In 1910 <b>he</b> <b>abruptly</b> left for the German University of Marburg, where he studied under Neo-Kantian philosophers Hermann Cohen, Nicolai Hartmann and Paul Natorp.|$|E
25|$|Construction on {{the house}} began in, or around, April 1774 and a {{majority}} of the house was probably completed before the death of the architect in November or December of the same year. Patron Matthias Hammond probably never occupied his elegant house because <b>he</b> <b>abruptly</b> left Annapolis for his family's country estate in 1776. He died in 1786 after renting the house for many years.|$|E

25|$|When Blood Sugar Sex Magik was {{released}} on 24 September 1991, it received an overwhelmingly positive critical response. The album peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 200, {{and went on to}} sell over seven million copies in the U.S. alone. The album's ensuing tour was critically acclaimed– the Chili Peppers commonly performed shows with over twenty thousand in attendance. Seattle-based grunge band Nirvana also toured with them during the West Coast leg of their United States tour. The massive attention the Chili Peppers started receiving, however, caused Frusciante to feel extremely uncomfortable, and <b>he</b> <b>abruptly</b> quit the band during the Japanese leg of the album's tour.|$|E
25|$|Mannock {{applied for}} a {{passport}} at Christmas 1913, and received a stamped copy on 10 January 1914 describing himself as a telegraph and telephone mechanic. The original survives at the RAF Museum in Hendon. On 9 February 1914, <b>he</b> <b>abruptly</b> ended his time in Wellingborough, and boarded a tramp steamer from Tilbury to Constantinople in Turkey {{to take a position}} at the Societe Ottomane des Telephones (Ottoman Telephone Exchange). In 1914, as war became likely, Mannock and his fellow employees noticed a change in the political climate, and their Turkish hosts became openly hostile and anti-British. At the outbreak of war in Europe in August 1914, the country remained neutral. In October 1914 the Turks allied themselves with the Central Powers, the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. As an enemy subject he was interned.|$|E

25|$|Mark is {{the elder}} son of Albert Square {{residents}} Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) and Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard). Initially, Mark gets involved in drugs with Nick Cotton (John Altman), attempts {{to join a}} racist organisation known as The New Movement, is a suspect in Reg Cox's (Johnnie Clayton) murder, and generally clashes with his parents. With no solution to these problems in sight, <b>he</b> <b>abruptly</b> leaves home without telling anyone. He isn't seen again until eight months later when he contacts his parents through a runaways' agency and Pauline and Arthur find him in Southend-on-Sea. Mark is now living with an older Swedish woman named Ingrid and her children who call Mark Daddy and is working as a mechanic at a go-cart track. He and Ingrid split up soon afterwards and Mark moves on {{to work on a}} farm in Wales and then Gloucester and finally Newcastle.|$|E
500|$|On 6 June 1970, Barrett {{gave his}} {{one and only}} solo {{performance}}, the performance {{was held at the}} Kensington Olympia, backed by Gilmour and Shirley, and baffled the audience (including Gilmour and Shirley) when <b>he</b> <b>abruptly</b> took off his guitar after the fourth number and walked off stage. They played [...] "Terrapin", [...] "Gigolo Aunt", [...] "Effervescing Elephant", and [...] "Octopus". From the start of the performance up to (but not including) [...] "Octopus", the vocals were inaudible. The performance has been bootlegged.|$|E
500|$|Meyer is {{a former}} United States Senator and Vice President of the United States {{following}} an unsuccessful run for President. During the first season, as Vice President she was powerless and disregarded by most other important officials, leading to various humiliations and indignities. During the second season she begins to amass some power and influence. In the third season, she contemplates challenging the incumbent president for their unnamed party's nomination {{in light of his}} political weakness, but the issue is mooted when <b>he</b> <b>abruptly</b> resigns, allowing her to become the president. [...] In the fourth season, she has assumed office but is facing strong primary and general-election challengers of her own. The general election results in a tie, setting the stage for the fifth season, as the United States House of Representatives prepares to choose the president.|$|E

500|$|Van Gogh was {{a serious}} and {{thoughtful}} child. He was taught at home by his mother and a governess, and in 1860 {{was sent to the}} village school. In 1864 he was placed in a boarding school at Zevenbergen, where he felt abandoned, and campaigned to come home. Instead, in 1866 his parents sent him to the middle school in Tilburg, where he was deeply unhappy. His interest in art began at a young age. He was encouraged to draw as a child by his mother, and his early drawings are expressive, but do not approach the intensity of his later work. Constantijn C. Huysmans, who had been a successful artist in Paris, taught the students at Tilburg. His philosophy was to reject technique in favour of capturing the impressions of things, particularly nature or common objects. Van Gogh's profound unhappiness seems to have overshadowed the lessons, which had little effect; in March 1868 <b>he</b> <b>abruptly</b> returned home. He later wrote that his youth was [...] "austere and cold, and sterile".|$|E
500|$|A {{complete}} inquest into Cancellor's {{death was}} initiated. His body {{was taken for}} autopsy on 28April and {{was found to be}} covered in blood under the gloves and stockings. His thighs were [...] "reduced to a perfect jelly" [...] and his body was covered in bruises and cuts, including two inch-deep holes in his right leg, deep enough to allow the medical examiner, Robert Willis, to touch the bone underneath. Willis reported that other than these injuries, the boy was healthy and his internal organs (including the heart) were free of disease. He thus concluded that Cancellor had not died of natural causes, as Hopley had suggested, and noted that the boy had obviously been beaten shortly before his death. A female servant named Ellen Fowler, when questioned by investigators, reported that she had heard Cancellor screaming and being beaten from 10pm until midnight and that, shortly thereafter, <b>he</b> <b>abruptly</b> fell silent. She also noted traces of blood in the house and on Hopley's candlestick, which was left outside Cancellor's bedroom, and evidence that Cancellor's and Hopley's clothes had been washed soon before the former was pronounced dead. Two other servants testified in the inquiry and gave similar accounts.|$|E
500|$|During {{a trip to}} California on Republican Party {{business}} {{in the summer of}} 1973, Bundy rekindled his relationship with Brooks, who marveled at his transformation into a serious, dedicated professional seemingly on the cusp of a distinguished legal and political career. He continued to date Kloepfer as well, though neither woman was aware of the other's existence. In the fall of 1973 Bundy matriculated at UPS Law School and continued courting Brooks, who flew to Seattle several times to stay with him. They discussed marriage; at one point he introduced her to Davis as his fiancée. In January 1974, however, <b>he</b> <b>abruptly</b> broke off all contact; her phone calls and letters went unreturned. Finally reaching him by phone a month later, Brooks demanded to know why Bundy had unilaterally ended their relationship without explanation. In a flat, calm voice, he replied, [...] "Stephanie, I have no idea what you mean" [...] and hung up. She never heard from him again. [...] He later explained, [...] "I just wanted to prove to myself that I could have married her"; but Brooks concluded in retrospect that he had deliberately planned the entire courtship and rejection in advance as vengeance for the breakup she initiated in 1968.|$|E

500|$|When {{they come}} outside, Mark {{and the others}} welcome them warmly. [...] Leslie enjoys herself at the party and, when the beer runs out and the party is about to end, she keeps it going by {{retrieving}} the wine and cheese from the gift basket. [...] The next morning, she feels guilty and, despite her boss Ron's (Nick Offerman) assurance that [...] "t's {{not that big a}} deal," [...] Leslie issues a public apology to every government official in Pawnee, including a link to the new pit website. [...] Later, however, she learns April has placed a drunken video of herself drinking the rest of the wine on the site, even though she is only 19. [...] Ron tells Leslie an ethics board has called for a disciplinary hearing with Leslie. [...] Leslie apologizes to the board and defends April, accepting responsibility for the video. [...] As the questions from the board continue, Ron angrily defends Leslie, insisting, [...] "Leslie has never broken a rule in her life, to the point that it's annoying." [...] <b>He</b> <b>abruptly</b> ends the meeting and insists they will have to go through him to give Leslie anything more than a slap on the wrist.|$|E
500|$|His restive nature, however, did not diminish. As a young man, Saint-Just was [...] "wild, handsome, [...] transgressive". Well-connected and popular, {{he showed}} a special affection toward {{a young woman}} of Blérancourt, Thérèse Gellé. She was the {{daughter}} of another wealthy notary, a powerful and autocratic figure in the town; he was still an undistinguished adolescent. He is said to have proposed marriage to her; she is said to have desired it. Though no hard evidence exists regarding their relationship, official records show that on 25 July 1786, Thérèse was married to Emmanuel Thorin, the scion of a prominent local family. Saint-Just was out of town and unaware of the event, and tradition portrays him as brokenhearted. Whatever his true state, it is known that {{a few weeks after the}} marriage <b>he</b> <b>abruptly</b> left home for Paris – without an announcement, but not without gathering up a pair of pistols and a good quantity of his mother's silver. His venture turned short when his mother had him seized by police and sent to a reformatory (maison de correction) where he stayed from September 1786 to March 1787. Chastened, Saint-Just attempted to begin anew: he enrolled as a student at the School of Law, Reims University. After a year, however, he drifted away from law school and returned to his mother's home in Blérancourt penniless, without any occupational prospects.|$|E
500|$|Frusciante {{joined the}} Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1988, {{at the age}} of 18, and {{released}} his first album with the group, Mother's Milk the following year. The follow-up album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, was recorded in an empty mansion that the band decided to live in for the duration of recording. Frusciante adapted well to the environment, and often spent his time alone painting, listening to music, and recording songs that would eventually make up {{the first half of the}} album, Niandra Lades. Blood Sugar Sex Magik was released on September 24, 1991 and was an instant success. The album peaked at number three in the U.S. and went on to sell over 12 million copies worldwide. Soon after the album's release, Frusciante developed a dislike of the band's newfound popularity. He felt that the band was too famous, and wished they were still playing small nightclubs like they were before he joined the group. By his own admission, the band's rise to popularity took Frusciante by surprise, and he could not cope with it. During Blood Sugar Sex Magik's promotional tour, Frusciante began using heroin and cocaine heavily. He and vocalist Anthony Kiedis often argued before and after performances. According to Kiedis, Frusciante purposely sabotaged the Saturday Night Live performance of [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] by playing the wrong intro for the song and out of key. His relationship with the band had become progressively more strained, and <b>he</b> <b>abruptly</b> quit during the Japanese leg of their world tour in 1992.|$|E
