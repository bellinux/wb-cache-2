He was hired by David Bennion and emphasized natural, <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>farming</b> and fermentation. Draper is known for drying his own oak staves for use in barrels, which may be a component of the dusty [...] "Draper Perfume" [...] that is characteristic of Ridge wines. on 1 July 2016, Draper retired as CEO and Head Winemaker of the company, but remains chairman of the board. He produced 47 vintages for Ridge.|$|E

In 2003, now long recognized internationally {{as a great}} poet, he hosted the first international poetry festival in Indonesia (in Makassar, Solo, Bandung and Jakarta). Rendra repeatedly stood {{on the list of}} candidates for the Nobel Prize for Literature and he saw international publications of his texts and made numerous appearances at literary festivals around the world. Until his death, he worked continuously on books, literature, and various projects and productions, and occasionally as a movie actor.His last home, in Depok, south of Jakarta, was a farm and until recently was also the home of the Bengkel Teater, where Rendra and his actors and artists lived, worked and also maintained an <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>farming</b> operation.|$|E
40|$|During {{recent years}} the service-oriented {{business}} approach of Chemical Leasing has been researched and implemented at various companies of different industry sectors around the globe. The novel business model promotes sustainable use of chemicals through linking the supplier’s sales income to chemical performance. Experiences show that key elements of a successful application of chemical leasing are know-how exchange and process optimization. Excessive use of chemicals in the agriculture sector emphasizes the potential in application of chemical leasing in the country. Nanotechnology is a major emerging technology, which can revolutionize the agriculture sector by employing special nanoscale properties of matter. It {{can be applied to}} agrochemicals and fertilizer in order to improve quality and safety, as well as reduce environmental and health effects. Sri Lanka as a country based on an agricultural economy has the potential to use these new technologies for its socio- economical development. Global need of <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>farming</b> system, increasing global nano food market, growing demand for safe and healthy food, threat from changing weather conditions and increasing risk of diseases to plants highlight the opportunities. The proposed model performs as a national frame work for management of agrochemicals in the country. The research “chemical leasing & nanotechnology in agriculture sector” introduces the use of Blue Ocean strategy to enter the sustainable farming system...|$|E
40|$|Requirements for the {{development}} of <b>sustainable</b> <b>farm</b> systems include the generation of site-specific management practices and heightened levels of awareness and empowerment within the farming community. The current model of technology development and transfer does not adequately facilitate {{the development}} of these characteristics. This study elaborates an alternative, participatory approach for agricultural extension, and presents the experiences of a group consisting of six farmers and a university co-research team, who employed this approach over a 17 -month period to develop more <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>farm</b> systems. The stages of a "process of development model" are: General Systems Description, Convergence, Implementation, Exchange, and Monitoring and Evaluation. This model is proposed as a means to expand the potential of participatory extension strategies to facilitate the development of sustainable agricultural systems. The primary implications of the participatory extension approach for the future roles of agricultural extension workers are outlined...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess qualitatively, through a participatory approach, the potential for increasing the value added in the Dutch dairy production chain. A workshop involving stakeholders and experts in the Dutch dairy sector developed three scenarios, envisioned according to the strategic interests of the dairy chain in the Netherlands. These scenarios address major trends including changing consumer preferences, increasing pressure for more cost-efficient production, and rising environmental concerns. The scenarios indicate different directions in which the dairy chain in the Netherlands might develop in the next 5 to 20 years. The first scenario envisions the prevalence of producing differentiated raw milk with enhanced health or improved manufacturing properties. The second scenario envisions a dairy chain that is reduced to producing fresher and more individually customized dairy products with improved shelf life. The third scenario envisions <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> dairy <b>farming</b> with improved animal welfare. These scenarios show that when improving the dairy sector it is important to consider the entire chain, and hence concerted and co-ordinated actions by the various stakeholders are necessary. Further studies quantifying the consequences of different scenario settings are necessary...|$|R
40|$|This {{qualitative}} research was generally aimed at formulating strategies for developing rural toun'sm {{based on the}} concept of <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> tourism. Data were collected using several techniques including site observation, interview, document study, and focus group discussion. Triangulation of data sources was applied to perform validity. Data analysis was based on interactive model (Miles and Huberman, 1984). Research results indicate that in the Karanganyar Regency there are abundant rural tourism attractions ranging from natural, cultural and agricultural potentials. However, there are some constraints including limited knowledge about <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> tourism, lack of tourism stakeholders commitment and discipline, lack of competence of human resources in providing tourism services dealing with rural tourism activities, limited information and promotion on rural tourism products which are developed based on <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> tourism concept, and lack of institution which has strong commitment to develop <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> rural tourism. One of the strategies to develop rural tourism based {{on the concept of}} <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> tourism include developing the competence and capacity of tourism human resources, especially of Berjo Village, dealing with the development of rural tourism which is based on the concept of <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> tourism.
