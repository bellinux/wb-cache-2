40|$|Experimental {{lines of}} Drosophila melanogaster {{derived from a}} natural population, which had been {{isolated}} in the laboratory for ~ 70 generations, were crossed {{to determine if the}} expression of additive, dominance and epistatic genetic variation in development time and viability was associated with the environment. No association was found between the level of additive genetic effects and environmental value for either trait, but nonadditive genetic effects increased at both extremes of the environmental range for development time. The expression of high levels of dominance and epistatic genetic variation at environmental extremes may be a general expectation for some traits. The disruption of the <b>epistatic</b> <b>gene</b> complexes in the parental lines resulted in hybrid breakdown toward faster development and there was some indication of hybrid breakdown toward higher viability. A combination of genetic drift and natural selection had therefore resulted in different <b>epistatic</b> <b>gene</b> complexes being selected after ~ 70 generations from a common genetic base. After crossing, the hybrid populations were observed for 10 generations. Epistasis contributed on average 12 hr in development time.

40|$|International audienceA barrier for {{horizontal}} {{gene transfer}} is high gene expression, which is metabolically expensive. Silencing of horizontally-acquired {{genes in the}} bacterium Escherichia coli {{is caused by the}} global transcriptional repressor H-NS. The activity of H-NS is enhanced or diminished by other proteins including its homologue StpA, and Hha and YdgT. The interconnections of H-NS with these regulators and their role in silencing gene expression in E. coli are not well understood on a genomic scale. In this study, we use transcriptome sequencing to show that there is a bi-layered gene silencing system - involving the homologous H-NS and StpA - operating on horizontally-acquired genes among others. We show that H-NS-repressed genes belong to two types, termed ``epistatic'' and ``unilateral''. In the absence of H-NS, the expression of ``epistatically controlled genes'' is repressed by StpA, whereas that of ``unilaterally controlled genes'' is not. <b>Epistatic</b> <b>genes</b> show a higher tendency to be non-essential and recently acquired, when compared to unilateral <b>genes.</b> <b>Epistatic</b> <b>genes</b> reach much higher expression levels than unilateral genes {{in the absence of the}} silencing system.

Field studies were conducted on plant N uptake {{in order to identify}} genotype differences in N-use efficiency and its relationship to grain yield, and determine the magnitude of additive, dominance and <b>epistatic</b> <b>gene</b> effects. Generations developed from nine inbred lines were tested in four N-level environments. ^ Efficiency of N utilization was evaluated by the ratios of total plant dry matter (TDM) and grain dry matter (GDM) to total N yield (TNY). Harvest index (HI) and nitrogen harvest index (NHI) were evaluated by using ratios of GDM to TDM and grain nitrogen yield to TNY, respectively. ^ Least square methods were used to obtain estimates of genetic parameters. Dominance gene effects (h(,jj(, 2 ̆ 7))) made the major contribution to variation in most of the traits. Partitioning of the h(,jj(, 2 ̆ 7)) effects reveals that average heterosis was the most important effect. Additive effects were significant for most traits, but the magnitude of those effects relative to dominance and epistatic effects were less important in the inheritance of those traits. ^ Additive x additive epistatic effects were important in environments with less N stress. The magnitudes of the epistatic parameters indicate that <b>epistatic</b> <b>gene</b> effects are operating in grain yield, NHI and N utilization efficiency. ^ Identification of efficient genotypes will provide opportunities to plant breeders for utilizing them in breeding for N-use efficiency necessary to achieve maximum and efficient crop production. Rapid advance in breeding for N-use efficiency can best be done using procedures which emphasize dominance, but additive and <b>epistatic</b> <b>gene</b> effects should also be considered. ^ Dominance and additive x additive epistasis can be utilized in intrapopulation selection schemes; but overdominance and dominance types of epistasis require some form of reciprocal recurrent selection, which requires that two heterotic populations be maintained so that inbred lines can be extracted from each to evaluate in interpopulation hybrids. Improvement of the source populations might be done with S(, 2) family testing and selection after screening among S(, 1) families, or by some other system such as RRS using full-sib families. ...|$|E

Eight generations of three crosses involved three parental lines were evaluated for disease incidence (percentage of infected plants) and disease severity under natural occurrence of PBNV infection in a randomized complete block design with six replications. Evaluations were carried out at 30, 40, 50 and 60 Days After Planting (DAP). The analysis followed Hayman’s model and Gamble’s notations were used to describe parameters of gene effects. Joint scaling test was used to determine adequacy of the model. Additive gene effect was the most important contribution to genetic variation in generation means for both disease incidence and disease severity in the cross ICGV 86388 x IC 10. Selection for lower disease incidence and disease severity in this cross is promising. Additive gene effect and additive x additive <b>epistatic</b> <b>gene</b> effect were also important but in lower magnitude in the cross ICGV 86388 x KK 60 - 1 for disease incidence at 60 DAP. The presence of significant dominance gene effect in this cross for disease incidence might hinder the progress from selection. The consistent and significant additive gene effect for disease severity might provide a better selection strategy. Additive gene effect was significant for disease incidence only in the cross IC 10 x KK 60 - 1 at 60 DAP.

40|$|Abstract Background Robustness to insults, both {{external}} and internal, is a characteristic feature of life. One level of biological organization for which noise and robustness have been extensively studied is gene expression. Cells {{have a variety}} of mechanisms for buffering noise in gene expression, but it is not completely clear what rules govern whether or not a given gene uses such tools to maintain appropriate expression. Results Here, we show a general association between the degree to which yeast cells have evolved mechanisms to buffer changes in gene expression and whether they possess protein-protein interactions. We argue that this effect bears an affinity to epistasis, because yeast appears to have evolved regulatory mechanisms such that distant changes in gene copy number for a protein-protein interaction partner gene can alter a gene's expression. This association is not unexpected given recent work linking epistasis and the deleterious effects of changes in gene dosage (i. e., the dosage balance hypothesis). Using gene expression data from artificial aneuploid strains of bakers' yeast, we found that genes coding for proteins that physically interact with other proteins show less expression variation in response to aneuploidy than do other genes. This effect is even more pronounced for genes whose products interact with proteins encoded on aneuploid chromosomes. We further found that genes targeted by transcription factors encoded on aneuploid chromosomes were more likely to change in expression after aneuploidy. Conclusions We suggest that these observations can be best understood as resulting from the higher fitness cost of misexpression in <b>epistatic</b> <b>genes</b> and a commensurate greater regulatory control of them. </p...|$|R

Whereas the life cycle of the dicotyledonous model species Arabidopsis thaliana is controlled by two <b>epistatic</b> <b>genes,</b> FLOWERING LOCUS C and FRIGIDA [1, 2, 3], three unrelated loci (VERNALIZATION 1 ??? 3) determine the spring and winter habits of monocotyledonous plants such as temperate cereals [4, 5, 6]. In the core eudicot species Beta vulgaris, whose lineage diverged from that leading to Arabidopsis shortly after the monocot-dicot split 140 million years ago [7, 8], the bolting locus B [9] is a master switch distinguishing annuals from biennials. Here, we isolated B and show that the pseudo-response regulator gene BOLTING TIME CONTROL 1 (BvBTC 1), through regulation of the FLOWERING LOCUS T genes [10], is absolutely necessary for flowering and mediates the response to both long days and vernalization. Our results suggest that domestication of beets involved the selection of a rare partial loss-of-function BvBTC 1 allele that imparts reduced sensitivity to photoperiod that is restored by vernalization, thus conferring bienniality, and illustrate how evolutionary plasticity at a key regulatory point can enable new life cycle strategies...|$|R
