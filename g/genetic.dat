5|$|A non-chemical {{vector control}} {{strategy}} involves <b>genetic</b> manipulation of malaria mosquitoes. Advances in <b>genetic</b> engineering technologies {{make it possible}} to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a <b>genetic</b> control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.|$|E
5|$|A {{portion of}} all <b>genetic</b> {{variation}} is functionally neutral, producing no phenotypic effect or {{significant difference in}} fitness. Motoo Kimura's neutral theory of molecular evolution by <b>genetic</b> drift proposes that this variation accounts for a large fraction of observed <b>genetic</b> diversity. Neutral events can radically reduce <b>genetic</b> variation through population bottlenecks. which among other things can cause the founder effect in initially small new populations. When <b>genetic</b> variation does not result in differences in fitness, selection cannot directly affect the frequency of such variation. As a result, the <b>genetic</b> variation at those sites is higher than at sites where variation does influence fitness. However, after a period with no new mutations, the <b>genetic</b> variation at these sites is eliminated due to <b>genetic</b> drift. Natural selection reduces <b>genetic</b> variation by eliminating maladapted individuals, and consequently the mutations that caused the maladaptation. At the same time, new mutations occur, resulting in a mutation–selection balance. The exact outcome of the two processes depends both on {{the rate at which}} new mutations occur and on the strength of the natural selection, which is a function of how unfavourable the mutation proves to be.|$|E
5|$|Bulb offsets {{and tissue}} culture produce <b>genetic</b> clones {{of the parent}} plant and thus {{maintaining}} <b>genetic</b> integrity of the cultivars. Bulb offsets usually require {{at least a year}} before flowering. Commercially, plants may be propagated in vitro and then planted out to grow into plants large enough to sell.|$|E
5|$|Counseling and {{guidelines}} {{on the use}} of <b>genetic</b> testing for HD have become models for other <b>genetic</b> disorders, such as autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias. Presymptomatic testing for HD has also influenced testing for other illnesses with <b>genetic</b> variants such as polycystic kidney disease, familial Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer. The European Molecular Genetics Quality Network have published yearly external quality assessment scheme for molecular <b>genetic</b> testing for this disease and have developed best practice guidelines for <b>genetic</b> testing for HD to assist in testing and reporting of results.|$|E
5|$|Domestication is {{also studied}} {{by using the}} <b>genetic</b> {{material}} of present-day horses and comparing it with the <b>genetic</b> material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations. The variation in the <b>genetic</b> material shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse, while many mares were part of early domesticated herds. This {{is reflected in the}} difference in <b>genetic</b> variation between the DNA that is passed on along the paternal, or sire line (Y-chromosome) versus that passed on along the maternal, or dam line (mitochondrial DNA). There are very low levels of Y-chromosome variability, but a great deal of <b>genetic</b> variation in mitochondrial DNA. There is also regional variation in mitochondrial DNA due to the inclusion of wild mares in domestic herds. Another characteristic of domestication is an increase in coat color variation. In horses, this increased dramatically between 5000 and 3000 BC.|$|E

5|$|<b>Genetic</b> testing results {{published}} in 2001 indicated that Namib Desert Horses {{are one of}} the most isolated horse populations in the world, with the second-lowest <b>genetic</b> variation of all horse populations that have been studied to date. In part, this is due to their small founding population, and generally small modern population, made smaller during periods of drought. Despite the large domesticated breeding population from which the horses originally descended, at least one <b>genetic</b> bottleneck has occurred in the breed's history, resulting in a significant decline in <b>genetic</b> variation over a relatively short period of time. Although an ideal minimum population size for <b>genetic</b> variability would be around 200 horses, the current range cannot support this population given the average rainfall. Estimates for a necessary minimum population to maintain <b>genetic</b> effectiveness range between 100 and 150 animals.|$|E
5|$|Hans Asperger {{described}} common symptoms {{among his}} patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a <b>genetic</b> contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene {{has yet been}} identified, multiple factors are believed {{to play a role}} in the expression of autism, given the phenotypic variability seen in children with AS. Evidence for a <b>genetic</b> link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher incidence of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading). Most behavioral <b>genetic</b> research suggests that all autism spectrum disorders have shared <b>genetic</b> mechanisms, but AS may have a stronger <b>genetic</b> component than autism. There is probably a common group of genes where particular alleles render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.|$|E
5|$|If the {{variance}} in the number of offspring is much greater than that given by the binomial distribution assumed by the Wright–Fisher model, then given the same overall speed of <b>genetic</b> drift ({{the variance}} effective population size), <b>genetic</b> drift is a less powerful force compared to selection. Even for the same variance, if higher moments of the offspring number distribution exceed those of the binomial distribution then again the force of <b>genetic</b> drift is substantially weakened.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Motoo Kimura rekindled {{the debate}} with his neutral theory of {{molecular}} evolution, which claims {{that most of}} the <b>genetic</b> changes are caused by <b>genetic</b> drift acting on neutral mutations.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{study was}} {{published}} that examined <b>genetic</b> variation among five Indian equine breeds—the Manipuri, Marwari, Spiti, Bhutia, and Zanskari. Based on analysis of microsatellite DNA, the Manipuri {{was found to}} have the greatest <b>genetic</b> distance from the Marwari, and a much closer <b>genetic</b> distance to the other three breeds. The distance from the Marwari was not only <b>genetic,</b> but seen in physical characteristics, particularly height and environmental adaptability. The physical differences were attributed to differing ancestries: the Marwari horse is closely associated with the Arabian, while the four other breeds are thought to have descended at least in part from the Tibetan pony. None of the breeds in the study were found to be closely genetically associated with the Thoroughbred.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of {{molecular}} studies, the preservation of a specimen that can vouch {{for the source of}} the tissue sample used to gather <b>genetic</b> data has been recommended, as <b>genetic</b> analysis often yields surprising results that make reexamination of the original specimen crucial.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} {{that there is a}} strong <b>genetic</b> {{component}} to deferred gratification, though no direct link has been established. Since many complex <b>genetic</b> interactions are necessary for neurons to perform the simplest tasks, it is hard to isolate one gene to study this behavior. For this same reason, multiple genes are likely responsible for deferred gratification. Further research is necessary to discover the <b>genetic</b> corollaries to delayed gratification.|$|E
5|$|Migration {{in birds}} is highly labile and is {{believed}} to have developed independently in many avian lineages. While it is agreed that the behavioral and physiological adaptations necessary for migration are under <b>genetic</b> control, some authors have argued that no <b>genetic</b> change is necessary for migratory behavior to develop in a sedentary species because the <b>genetic</b> framework for migratory behavior exists in nearly all avian lineages. This explains the rapid appearance of migratory behavior after the most recent glacial maximum.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{will only}} cause evolution {{if there is}} enough <b>genetic</b> variation in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one common hypothesis was blending inheritance. But with blending inheritance, <b>genetic</b> variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural selection implausible. The Hardy–Weinberg principle provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. The frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant {{in the absence of}} selection, mutation, migration and <b>genetic</b> drift.|$|E
5|$|On May 21, 2008 President George W. Bush {{signed into}} law the <b>Genetic</b> Information Non{{discrimination}} Act (GINA). The bill aims to protect Americans against discrimination based on their <b>genetic</b> information {{when it comes to}} health insurance and employment. The issue had been debated for 13 years before becoming law. It is designed to protect citizens while not hindering <b>genetic</b> research.|$|E
5|$|One {{study has}} {{reported}} {{a connection between}} a specific <b>genetic</b> marker and disorganized attachment (not RAD) associated with problems of parenting.

5|$|Pink-flowering {{populations have}} a {{relatively}} distinct <b>genetic</b> makeup, whereas red or white flowering populations have more evident sharing of <b>genetic</b> traits. Research based on DNA profiling has revealed substantial <b>genetic</b> diversity within and between flower colour races and site populations. This has implications for vegetation projects in that provenance material needs to be collected from a wide geographic area to maintain this diversity.|$|E
5|$|Recombination allows {{chromosomes}} {{to exchange}} <b>genetic</b> information and produces new combinations of genes, {{which increases the}} efficiency of natural selection and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins. <b>Genetic</b> recombination can also be involved in DNA repair, particularly in the cell's response to double-strand breaks.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} {{differences}} {{should be regarded as}} pseudo-changes in the <b>genetic</b> code due to the phenomenon of RNA editing, which is common in mitochondria. In higher plants, it was thought that CGG encoded for tryptophan and not arginine; however, the codon in the processed RNA was discovered to be the UGG codon, consistent with the standard <b>genetic</b> code for tryptophan. Of note, the arthropod mitochondrial <b>genetic</b> code has undergone parallel evolution within a phylum, with some organisms uniquely translating AGG to lysine.|$|E
5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} in the cheetah is 38, {{the same as}} in most other felids (though for the ocelot and the margay the number is 36). A remarkable feature of the cheetah is its unusually low <b>genetic</b> variability in comparison to other felids. Consequently, individuals show considerable <b>genetic</b> similarity to one another, as illustrated by skin grafts, electrophoretic evidence and reproductive surveys. A prolonged period of inbreeding, following a <b>genetic</b> bottleneck during the last ice age, {{is believed to be the}} reason behind this anomaly. The consequences of such <b>genetic</b> uniformity might include a low sperm count, decreased sperm motility, deformed flagella, difficulty in captive breeding and susceptibility to disease.|$|E
5|$|The <b>genetic</b> code is the set {{of rules}} by which {{information}} encoded within <b>genetic</b> material (DNA or mRNA sequences) is translated into proteins by living cells. Translation is accomplished by the ribosome, which links amino acids in an order specified by mRNA, using transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA three nucleotides at a time. The <b>genetic</b> code is highly similar among all organisms and can be expressed in a simple table with 64 entries.|$|E
5|$|The {{neutral theory}} of {{molecular}} evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes {{are the result}} of the fixation of neutral mutations by <b>genetic</b> drift. Hence, in this model, most <b>genetic</b> changes in a population {{are the result of}} constant mutation pressure and <b>genetic</b> drift. This form of the neutral theory is now largely abandoned, since {{it does not seem to}} fit the <b>genetic</b> variation seen in nature. However, a more recent and better-supported version of this model is the nearly neutral theory, where a mutation that would be effectively neutral in a small population is not necessarily neutral in a large population. Other alternative theories propose that <b>genetic</b> drift is dwarfed by other stochastic forces in evolution, such as <b>genetic</b> hitchhiking, also known as <b>genetic</b> draft.|$|E
5|$|This chapter {{tells the}} tale of the <b>genetic</b> code, and the lac operon, showing that the {{environment}} and <b>genetic</b> switches together control gene expression. He introduces the evo-devo gene toolkit.|$|E
5|$|This teleonomy is {{the quality}} whereby the process of natural {{selection}} creates and preserves traits that are seemingly fitted for the functional roles they perform. The processes by which the changes occur, {{from one generation to}} another, are called evolutionary processes or mechanisms. The four most widely recognised evolutionary processes are natural selection (including sexual selection), <b>genetic</b> drift, mutation and gene migration due to <b>genetic</b> admixture. Natural selection and <b>genetic</b> drift sort variation; mutation and gene migration create variation.|$|E
5|$|Viral {{recombination}} produces <b>genetic</b> variation {{that likely}} {{contributes to the}} evolution of resistance to anti-retroviral therapy. Recombination may also contribute, in principle, to overcoming the immune defenses of the host. Yet, for the adaptive advantages of <b>genetic</b> variation to be realized, the two viral genomes packaged in individual infecting virus particles need to have arisen from separate progenitor parental viruses of differing <b>genetic</b> constitution. It is unknown how often such mixed packaging occurs under natural conditions.|$|E
5|$|When {{there are}} few copies of an allele, the effect of <b>genetic</b> drift is larger, and when there are many copies the effect is smaller. In the early 20th century, {{vigorous}} debates occurred over {{the relative importance of}} natural selection versus neutral processes, including <b>genetic</b> drift. Ronald Fisher, who explained natural selection using Mendelian genetics, held the view that <b>genetic</b> drift plays at the most a minor role in evolution, and this remained the dominant view for several decades. In 1968, population geneticist Motoo Kimura rekindled the debate with his neutral theory of molecular evolution, which claims that most instances where a <b>genetic</b> change spreads across a population (although not necessarily changes in phenotypes) are caused by <b>genetic</b> drift acting on neutral mutations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Genetic</b> {{counseling}} is {{the process}} of providing information about <b>genetic</b> conditions, diagnostic testing, and risks in other family members, within the framework of nondirective counseling. <b>Genetic</b> counselors are non-physician members of the medical genetics team who specialize in family risk assessment and counseling of patients regarding <b>genetic</b> disorders. The precise role of the <b>genetic</b> counselor varies somewhat depending on the disorder.|$|E
25|$|<b>Genetic</b> {{testing is}} often done {{as part of}} a <b>genetic</b> {{consultation}} and as of mid-2008 there were more than 1,200 clinically applicable <b>genetic</b> tests available. Once a person decides to proceed with <b>genetic</b> testing, a medical geneticist, <b>genetic</b> counselor, primary care doctor, or specialist can order the test after obtaining informed consent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Genetic</b> testing, {{also known}} as DNA testing, allows the {{determination}} of bloodlines and the <b>genetic</b> diagnosis of vulnerabilities to inherited diseases. In agriculture, a form of <b>genetic</b> testing known as progeny testing {{can be used to}} evaluate the quality of breeding stock. In population ecology, <b>genetic</b> testing can be used to track <b>genetic</b> strengths and vulnerabilities of species populations.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Masatoshi Nei {{published}} {{what came}} to be known as Nei's standard <b>genetic</b> distance. This distance has the nice property that if the rate of <b>genetic</b> change (amino acid substitution) is constant per year or generation then Nei's standard <b>genetic</b> distance (D) increases in proportion to divergence time. This measure assumes that <b>genetic</b> differences are caused by mutation and <b>genetic</b> drift.|$|E

25|$|In humans, <b>genetic</b> testing {{can be used}} to {{determine}} a child's parentage (<b>genetic</b> mother and father) or in general a person's ancestry or biological relationship between people.
