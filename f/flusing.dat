40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{effectiveness}} of the flushing of sediment in the reservoir by means of flushing and Sluicing way, based on Physical Hydraulic Test (Model Test) in the laboratory. Flushing is removing accumulated deposited sediment. While slucing is releasing of sediment through the reservoir before settled or keep sediment remain in suspension and its occur during flood period. Sediments Flush Effectiveness represented by the percentage of released sediment by sediment deposited or the amount of sediment entering the reservoir during the flushing period. The model based on the prototipe from Detail Design of Structural Countermeasures for Sedimentation on Wonogiri Reservoir by Nippon Koei 2009. Running model duration is one hour, used free flow and submergence condition, with discharge variation Q= 100, 200 and 400 m 3 /s. Sluicing experiments conducted with some 60 liters of sediment sprinkle evenly wide flow, and Flushing implemented by 2, 00 m thickness of deposited sediment that spreaded over the reservoir bottom before running. From this research showed that Sluicing way more efficient than the flushing way, where the number of efficiency of sediment Sluicing way bigger than the efficiency of <b>flusing</b> way, in the running an hour in the laboratory test<br /...|$|E
40|$|Niacin supplementation {{improves}} dyslipidemia {{and lowers}} serum phosphorus levels in {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) patients. However, its adverse effects, including hot <b>flusing,</b> hinder the administration of niacin. We evaluated whether low-dose niacin supplementation can improve dyslipidemia, lower serum phosphorus levels, and be administered with a low frequency of adverse effects in patients with CKD. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical records of CKD patients who had taken niacin from January, 2009 to June, 2011. We excluded patients with CKD 1 and CKD 5. We then enrolled 31 CKD patients who had taken niacin at a fixed-dose of 500 mg/day for 6 months. We also randomly selected 30 CKD patients who had been taking statin for 9 months as a control group. Among 34 CKD patients prescribed niacin, 5 patients (14 %) complained of adverse effects, and 3 CKD patients (8 %) discontinued niacin. There {{were no significant differences}} in baseline data between the niacin group and the control group. The proportion of patients in the niacin group who had been taking a statin, or omega- 3 fatty acids was 67. 7 % and 48. 8 %, respectively. In the niacin group, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels was significantly increased (p< 0. 05), and triglyceride (p< 0. 05) at 12 weeks and 24 weeks compared to baseline levels. In the niacin group, phosphorous levels (p< 0. 05) were significantly decreased, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was significantly increased (p= 0. 016) at 24 weeks compared to baseline values; however, serum creatinine levels did not significantly change. Low dose niacin (500 mg/day) had a low freqeuncy of adverse effects and also improved dyslipidemia, lowered serum phosphorus levels, and increased GFR in CKD patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long term effects of low-dose niacin for renal progression of CKD...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: With daily {{increasing}} of {{medicinal herbs}} consumption in medical treatment, this branch and field of medicine is find the complementary of especial position in diseases treatments. Some herbs are consuming in traditional treatments {{but are not}} considered much yet which {{one of them is}} Echinophora platyloba. These herbs made us to study the effect of herbal essences on two spices bacteria and three types of fungi. From the picked herbs in growing season, its methanol essence achieved by the percolation method. In the next phrase, methanol essences of Echinophora Platyloba separately tested against two bacteria and three fungi and after study of the culture the results recorded. The results showed that the anti-bacterial effect on the growth of two bacteria (Staphilococus aureus and Pseudomonas aeroginosa) of this essences are methanol and even in high concentration the growth essences reach to zero. It is in case that there was no observation of prevention from growth for three considered funguses such as Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus and <b>Fluse</b> and Aspergillus niger. Anti-septic components obtained from plants are more effective in treating the diseases. They not only are effective to treat septic diseases but also can eliminate more side effects resulted from other chemical antibiotics.

40|$|The fish {{at sites}} located {{throughout}} the large, seasonally closed Wilson Inlet, {{on the southern}} coast of Western Australia, were sampled bimonthly between September 1987 and April 1989. Seine nets were used to sample nearshore shallow waters, while gill nets were employed in slightly more offshore and deeper waters. Twenty species were recorded in the shallows, of which the three species of atherinid and the three species of goby comprised > 97 % of the total catch. In terms of number of individuals, the 27 species recorded in gill nets in the deeper waters were dominated by Cnidoglanis macrocephalus and Platycephalus speculator, {{and to a lesser}} extent Engraulis australis, Aldrichetta forsteri, Sillaginodes punctata and Arripis georgianus. Fifty-five percent of the species recorded in the nearshore shallow waters and 18 % of those in offshore deeper waters spawn within Wilson Inlet; these species contributed 98. 5 and 63. 0 %, respectively, to the total catches in those waters. Classification and ordination showed that the composition of the fauna in the shallows was similar at all sites throughout the large basin and did not change conspicuously with season. However, the composition of catches taken in offshore waters differed between the lower part of the basin and the middle and upper regions of the basin, which in turn differed from those in the saline reaches of a tributary river. The four diagnostic species of the lower estuary were all marine species, while the three diagnostic species in the river included a marine species (Mugil cephalus) that often penetrates far upstream in other systems, and a species which was confined to the rivers (Acanthopagrus butcheri). The composition of the fish fauna in the offshore waters of the lower estuary between the middle of spring and middle of autumn was different in 1987 / 1988 (when the estuary mouth was open for only the first two months of that period) from that in 1988 / 1989 (when the mouth was open for the whole of that period). This difference is related to the greater number of marine species that were retained in the first of these years, when the estuary was open to the ocean for only a short period. The greater retention of marine species in 1987 / 1988 than in 1988 / 1989 probably reflects a far lower level of freshwater <b>flusing</b> and/or a less marked decline in salinity...|$|E
40|$|Hong Kong has practiced {{seawater}} toilet flushing since 1950 s. It saves 22 % {{of fresh}} water but inevitably results in high sulfate-laden saline sewage, causing corrosion of pressure sewers and odor (mainly H 2 S) at sewage treatment plants. The former has been solved by applying anti-corrosion pipes and dosing with super-oxygenated liquids. However, the latter cannot be solved at low cost because {{there are two major}} odor sources: 1) primary treatment and 2) sludge treatment. At the same time, current sewage treatment plants in Hong Kong produce 1000 tonnes of dried sludge per day, which has to be incinerated in the near future since the landfill capacity will be surpassed by 2017. In order to solve these problems cost-effectively as well as to maximize the benefits of the seawater toilet flushing practice, we have recently developed a novel biological nitrogen removal process for saline sewage treatment, which is named Sulfate reduction, Autotrophic denitrification and Nitrification Integrated (SANI®) process. The key features of this novel process include: elimination of primary treatment and sludge production as well as oxygen demand in organic matter removal. This novel process uses sulfate in the saline sewage originating from seawater toilet <b>flusing</b> to realize biological sulfate reduction (BSR) for effective removal of organic matter under an anaerobic condition. The produced sulfide dissolved completely due to production of sufficient alkalinity, providing adequate electron donors for subsequent autotrophic denitrification. Since all the three major biomasses, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), autotrophs for denitrification and nitrification produce little sludge, total sludge production can thus be minimized significantly. A 500 -day lab-scale system has demonstrated that no purposeful withdrawal of excess sludge was needed. In order to verify these results and further understand this feature, a steady-state model was developed in this research based on the mass balances of chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrogen, sulfur and charge and the stoichiometries of the sulfate reduction, autotrophic denitrification and nitrification. The model predictions agreed well with the measured data on COD, nitrate and sulfate removals, sulfide production, effluent Total Suspended Solids (TSS) as well as the mass balances of COD, sulfur and nitrogen in the system. The model also well explained the performance of the SANI® lab-scale system in the sludge production and the COD and nitrogen removals under various operating conditions. In order to further demonstrate the SANI® process in treating real saline sewage, a pilot-scale study was conducted with 10 m 3 /day of 6 -mm screened saline sewage at the Tung Chung Sewage Pumping Station. The SANI® pilot plant consisted of a sulfate reduction up-flow sludge bed (SRUSB), an anoxic bioreactor for autotrophic denitrification and an aerobic bioreactor for nitrification. The plant was operated at a steady state for 225 days, during which the average removal efficiencies of both COD and TSS were 87 % and no excess sludge was purposefully withdrawn. The total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency was found to be 55 % only, which was attributed to a very high fraction (26. 5 %) of inert soluble organic nitrogen in the incoming sewage, which mainly originated from the wastewater of the Hong Kong International Airport. Furthermore, a tracer test of the SRUSB revealed 5 % shortcircuit flow and 34. 6 % dead zones in this key reactor of the plant, indicating a good possibility to maximize the treatment capacity of the process for full-scale saline sewage treatment through reactor design optimization. Compared with conventional biological nitrogen removal processes, the SANI® process eliminates 90 % sludge waste, saves 35 % energy and reduces 36 % greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. This research work has confirmed that the SANI® process not only helps to eliminate the major odor sources originating from primary treatment and sludge treatment, but also promotes saline water supply as an economic and sustainable solution for water scarcity and sewage treatment in water-scarce costal areas. A new steady-state model was further developed in this research for evaluating the SANI® pilot plant. The model comprised: 1) a COD-based anaerobic hydrolysis kinetics to determine the removal of biodegradable COD and anaerobic hydrolysis rate in BSR under different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) and sludge retention times (SRTs), 2) elements (C, H, O, N, P, S), COD and charge mass balances for prediction of the concentrations of alkalinity (H 2 CO 3 * alkalinity+H 2 S alkalinity), COD, sulfate, sulfide, nitrate and free saline ammonia in the SRUSB, the anoxic autotrophic denitrifying reactor as well as the aerobic autotrophic nitrifying reactor of the plant, and 3) an inorganic carbon (HCO 3 -) and sulfide (H 2 S/HS-) mixed weak acid/base chemistry for pH prediction. Through characterization of the sewage organic matter and determination of the anaerobic hydrolysis kinetic rate and other relevant parameters, the steady-state model was validated successfully for application in the SANI® process. The model predictions agreed well with the experimental data of the pilot-scale trial, demonstrating that the model developed from this research can explain the causes and conditions for the minimal sludge production in the SANI® pilot plant. An integrated biological kinetic model was finally developed and applied to simulate the SANI® pilot plant. This kinetic model allows for five organic types, i. e. volatile fatty acids (VFA), fermentable biodegradable soluble organics (FBSO), biodegradable particulate organics (BPO), unbiodegradable particulate organics (UPO) and unbiodegradable soluble organics (USO), with different compositions of the incoming saline sewage. The kinetic model predictions (restricted to the steady state conditions) conformed favorably to the experimental measurements and the steady state model predictions, which validated the kinetic model. Based on the system optimization by this kinetic model, the SANI® pilot plant showed the potential to futher increase the volumetric loading rate and reduce the HRT simultaneously. The optimum values of recycle rateio from aerobic to anoxic bioreactor can be selected between 2. 5 and 2. 75, such as 2. 5 in the operation of SANI® pilot plant...|$|E
