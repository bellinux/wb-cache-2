5|$|Literary scholar M. Keith Booker {{argues that}} Vargas Llosa perfects the {{technique}} of <b>interlacing</b> dialogues in his novel The Green House. By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates {{the illusion of a}} flashback. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places. This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using {{near the end of his}} first novel, The Time of the Hero. However, he does not use <b>interlacing</b> dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in The Green House the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space. In contrast, Captain Pantoja and the Special Service employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts. This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf's mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.|$|E
5|$|The {{illustrations}} and ornamentation of the Book of Kells surpass that {{of other}} Insular Gospel books in extravagance and complexity. The decoration combines traditional Christian iconography with the ornate swirling motifs typical of Insular art. Figures of humans, animals and mythical beasts, together with Celtic knots and <b>interlacing</b> patterns in vibrant colours, enliven the manuscript's pages. Many of these minor decorative elements are imbued with Christian symbolism and so further emphasise the themes of the major illustrations.|$|E

50|$|HEVC was {{designed}} {{with the idea}} that progressive scan video would be used and no coding tools were added specifically for <b>interlaced</b> video. <b>Interlace</b> specific coding tools, such as MBAFF and PAFF, are not supported in HEVC. HEVC instead sends metadata that tells how the <b>interlaced</b> video was sent. <b>Interlaced</b> video may be sent either by coding each frame as a separate picture or by coding each field as a separate picture. For <b>interlaced</b> video HEVC can change between frame coding and field coding using Sequence Adaptive Frame Field (SAFF), which allows the coding mode to be changed for each video sequence. This allows <b>interlaced</b> video to be sent with HEVC without needing special <b>interlaced</b> decoding processes to be added to HEVC decoders.|$|R

5|$|Members of the Sclerodermatineae have {{fruit body}} shapes ranging from boletoid (with a cap, stipe, and tubes on the {{underside}} of the cap) to gasteroid. Boletoid fruit bodies sometimes have hollow stipes with a surface that is smooth to somewhat furfuraceous (covered with flaky particles), and lack the reticulation (a net-like pattern of <b>interlacing</b> lines) characteristic of some members of the Boletaceae. The pores are merulioid (wrinkled with low, uneven ridges), boletinoid, and either fine or coarse. The flesh is usually whitish to yellowish, and some species exhibit a blue staining reaction upon injury. In mass, spores are yellow; microscopically, the spores are ellipsoid in shape and have a smooth surface.|$|E

It has five panels, four of which are decorated with <b>interlacing</b> carvings of crosses and knots while the fifth is blank. The other fittings of the church date from the 19th century and include an octagonal pulpit with decorated panels. The west wall of the nave has a stone memorial to a Reverend William Griffith who died in 1752, the south wall has a war memorial to the dead of the First World War, and the north wall has an inscribed stone commemorating a Morris Lloyd (or Llwyd), a Royalist who was killed by Cromwell's troops in 1647.|$|E
5|$|Girih are {{elaborate}} <b>interlacing</b> patterns formed of five standardized shapes. The {{style is}} used in Persian Islamic architecture and also in decorative woodwork. Girih designs are traditionally made in different media including cut brickwork, stucco, and mosaic faience tilework. In woodwork, especially in the Safavid period, it could be applied either as lattice frames, left plain or inset with panels such as of coloured glass; or as mosaic panels used to decorate walls and ceilings, whether sacred or secular. In architecture, girih forms decorative interlaced strapwork surfaces from the 15thcentury to the 20thcentury. Most designs {{are based on a}} partially hidden geometric grid which provides a regular array of points; this is made into a pattern using 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotational symmetries which can fill the plane. The visible pattern superimposed on the grid is also geometric, with 6-, 8-, 10- and 12-pointed stars and a variety of convex polygons, joined by straps which typically seem to weave over and under each other. The visible pattern does not coincide with the underlying tiling.|$|E

For different purposes, different trade-offs are chosen: a maximal file may be best for archiving and editing, while a stripped down file may be best for use on a website, and similarly fast but poor compression is preferred when repeatedly editing and saving a file, while slow but high compression is preferred when a file is stable: when archiving or posting.|$|E

INTRODUCTION <b>Interlaced</b> video is widely used in transmitting a sequence of images.
