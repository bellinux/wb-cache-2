5|$|As {{a coping}} mechanism, self-harm can become psychologically {{addictive}} because, to the self-harmer, it works; it enables <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> {{to deal with}} intense stress in the current moment. The patterns sometimes created by it, such as specific time intervals between acts of self-harm, can also create a behavioural pattern that {{can result in a}} wanting or craving to fulfill thoughts of self-harm.|$|E
5|$|In Tan Eng Hong, the Court of Appeal {{stated that}} the same test for {{standing}} applies to both declarations and prerogative orders, and read the statements from Chan Hiang Leng Colin quoted above as an implicit acceptance that an applicant must demonstrate the violation of a right personal to <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> to have standing.|$|E

5|$|Under the Act, it is a {{contempt}} of Parliament to perform certain acts, for instance, to insult the Speaker or any Member of Parliament (MP) coming to or going from Parliament {{on account of}} his or her conduct in Parliament or of anything done or said by <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> in Parliament; or to publish any statement, whether in writing or otherwise, which falsely or scandalously defames, or which reflects on the character of, the Speaker or any MP touching on his or her conduct in Parliament or anything done or said by <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> in Parliament. It is presumably not open to a person charged with one of these offences to argue that it violates the Article 14 right to freedom of speech and expression. However, there is not yet any case law addressing this provision, and thus little guidance as to how the courts are to interpret the restriction.|$|E
5|$|Yumemi is very {{adamant about}} {{protecting}} humans and is happiest {{when she is}} helping those she serves. When she is unable to help someone, she gets terribly worried that she is incapable of offering assistance and must instead indirectly help a customer by directing <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> to someone who can. Protecting humans is her top priority and will even ignore previous orders {{to make sure no}} human is harmed when in her care.|$|E
5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court which commands a public body to perform a public duty, and is usually employed to compel public bodies to exercise the powers given to them. It {{may be used in}} combination with another remedy, most commonly a quashing order. In such a case, the quashing order will set aside the unlawful decision, and the {{mandatory order}} will require the public body to reconsider the matter. A person who complies with a mandatory order cannot have legal proceedings taken against <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> for doing so.|$|E

5|$|Bor is a {{guide for}} {{visually}} impaired skiers. In this role, he skis {{in front of the}} visually impaired skier and gives <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> direction to get down the course using speakers and a microphone. At the 2006 Winter Paralympics in Torino, Bor served as an Australian assistant coach. In 2009, following those Games, he shifted his role to serve as Melissa Perrine's guide as Perrine advanced further in the sport. He first skied with Perrine at a World Cup event in January 2010 where they finished fourth.|$|E
5|$|Impression Management {{is defined}} as when an {{individual}} attempts to present an acceptable image to those around <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> verbally or nonverbally (480). This definition is based on Goffman’s idea that individuals see themselves as others view them, so in essence they attempt {{to see themselves as}} if they are outside looking in (480). Goffman also dedicating this work to discover the subtle ways humans present acceptable images by concealing information that may conflict with the images for a particular situation. For instance, concealing tattoos when applying for a job in which tattoos would be inappropriate, or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting/interacting with dolls which society as a whole may see as abnormal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that a person lacks standing, there is a {{possibility}} that he or she may be able to ask the Attorney-General to allow <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> to bring a relator action. In this scenario, the Attorney-General would be the nominal plaintiff in the judicial review proceedings, but the case would actually be conducted by the individual. Bringing a relator action is one means of circumventing the requirement of standing on the part of the individual applicant, because the Attorney-General has an interest in upholding the law for the public benefit.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "Thirteen" [...] {{comes from}} the character's introduction: while searching for new team members House {{assigned}} all the applicants numbers rather than memorise all their names and persistently used it in reference to her. She did not correct <b>him</b> <b>or</b> offer <b>her</b> real name when prompted by fellow applicants, and the nickname stuck.|$|R

5|$|It {{is unclear}} how {{initiation}} may have affected a devotee's rank within the cult. After going through his third initiation, Lucius becomes a pastophoros, {{a member of a}} particular class of priests. If the third initiation was a requirement for becoming a pastophoros, it is possible that members moved up in the cult hierarchy by going through the series of initiations. Nevertheless, Apuleius refers to initiates and to priests as if they are separate groups within the cult. Initiation may have been a prerequisite for a devotee to become a priest but not have automatically made <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> into one.|$|E
5|$|One of the governor's most {{important}} political powers {{is the ability}} to call a special session of the General Assembly. During a two-year period, the assembly can meet on its own for no more than 91 days, and this often prevents them from passing all the legislation they intend to. This can give the governor considerable influence in the body which will often compromise on issues with <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> in exchange for a special legislative session.|$|E
5|$|State Opening of Parliament {{takes place}} {{annually}} at the Houses of Parliament. The heralds, including both ordinary and extraordinary officers, form the front {{part of the}} Royal Procession, preceding the Sovereign and other Great Officers of State. The procession starts {{at the bottom of}} the Victoria Tower, then up the Norman Porch to the Robing Chamber. Once the Sovereign has put on the Imperial State Crown, the heralds lead the monarch once again through the Royal Gallery into the House of Lords, where they remain with <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> during his or her speech and accompany the monarch until he or she leaves the Palace.|$|E
25|$|Self-worth – In {{the book}} Income, Saving and the Theory of Consumer Behavior (1949), J.S. Duesenberry {{proposed}} that a person's conspicuous consumption psychologically depends not only upon the actual level of spending, but also {{depends upon the}} degree of his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> spending, as compared with and to the spending of other people. That the conspicuous consumer is motivated by the importance, to <b>him</b> <b>or</b> to <b>her,</b> of {{the opinion of the}} social and economic reference groups for whom are performed the patterns of conspicuous consumption.|$|R

He is shocked and embarrassed to find Shirley chose to stay and isn't on the plane, and repeatedly calls her, pleading and arguing for her to return, {{saying that it is}} her place and she is embarrassing <b>him,</b> <b>or</b> telling <b>her</b> that her actions result from a mid-life crisis or menopause.|$|R
5000|$|The Mortlockese Language is a Micronesian {{language}} spoken {{primarily on the}} Mortlock Islands. In the Mortlockese language, reduplication is used to show a habitual or imperfective aspect. For example, /jææjæ/ means [...] "to use something" [...] while the word /jæjjææjæ/ means [...] "to use something habitually or repeatedly". Reduplication is also used in the Mortlockese Language to show extremity or extreme measures. One example {{of this can be}} seen in /ŋiimw alɛɛtɛj/ which means [...] "hate <b>him,</b> <b>her,</b> <b>or</b> it". To mean [...] "really hate <b>him,</b> <b>her,</b> <b>or</b> it," [...] the phrase changes to /ŋii~mw al~mw alɛɛtɛj/.|$|R
5|$|The Ages of Myst were {{occasionally}} seen as lonely by {{players and}} reviewers. As a result, Cyan added more characters to the sequel, Riven. Villagers scurry {{away as the}} player approaches, and major characters such as Gehn and a rebel band known as the Moiety address the player and give or take items away from <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her.</b> For the first time, Cyan directed the live action actors for Rivens scenes; the designers, including Richard Vander Wende, were apprehensive about how the characters would fit in the finished product. Rand Miller reprised his role of Atrus due to fan expectation, even though he hated acting.|$|E
5|$|The county {{magistrate}} and commandery administrator {{were the}} official court judges {{of the county}} and commandery, respectively. Their jurisdictions overlapped, yet the commandery administrator only interfered in county court cases when necessary; it was generally agreed that whoever arrested a criminal first {{would be the first}} to judge <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her.</b> If a commandery-level court case could not be resolved, the central government's Commandant of Justice was the final authority of appeal before the emperor. Yet he most often dealt with cases of political rebels and regicide in regards to kings, marquesses, and high officials. Above the Commandant was the emperor, the supreme judge and lawgiver.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the duty to act fairly varies greatly from case to case. Basic norms of {{fairness}} {{in the conduct of}} disciplinary proceedings need to be observed more strictly where the vocational future of a person is at stake, where there is an express duty on an association to make a decision only after conducting a hearing or an inquiry, and where the exercise of disciplinary powers may deprive a person of his or her property rights or impose a penalty on <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

5|$|The four {{difficulty}} {{levels for}} each song afford the player a learning curve {{in order to}} help <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> progress in skill. The first difficulty level, Easy, only focuses on the first three fret buttons while displaying a significantly reduced amount of notes for the player to play. Medium introduces a fourth fret button while adding more notes, and Hard includes the final fret button while adding additional notes. Expert does not introduce any other frets to learn, but adds more notes in a manner designed to challenge the player.|$|E
5|$|The {{privileges}} {{have been}} lost and eroded over time. Only three survived into the 20th century: {{the right to be}} tried by other peers of the realm instead of juries of commoners, freedom from arrest in civil (but not criminal) cases, and access to the Sovereign to advise <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> on matters of state. The right to be tried by other peers was abolished in 1948. Legal opinion considers the right of freedom from arrest as extremely limited in application, if at all. The remaining privilege is not exercised and was recommended for formal abolition in 1999, but has never been formally revoked.|$|E
5|$|While no {{official}} knot exists for tying the two {{ends of the}} thong together, the decorative diamond knot {{has become the most}} common. When produced, the thong is joined by a simple overhand knot and various region specific traditions have arisen around tying the diamond knot, including: having a fellow course member tie it; having a mentor or course leader tie it; and having the recipient tie it after completing some additional activity that shows he or she has mastered the skills taught to <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> during training.|$|E
40|$|A central {{feature of}} the life of the Trinity is {{contrast}} without conflict God is three and God is one. This dynamic has a spatial reference. The Three draw close to each other in the intimacy of love, but they also give each other space to be. This dynamic is a necessary condition for mature relationships on the human level. It is argued that effective pastoral counseling involves both moving in close through empathy and acceptance, and creating appropriate distance through a process that Martin Buber refers to as confirmation. Confirmation involves wrestling with the other person to help <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>him</b> actualize <b>her</b> <b>or</b> his God-given moral and spiritual potential...|$|R
