While the engines for the two sisters were identical, City of Paris produced 1,500 more horsepower. The ships were the first express liners with two propellers. Single screw liners were prone to shaft failure that forced them to return to port using auxiliary sails.

25|$|Great Western was an iron-strapped, wooden, side-wheel paddle steamer, {{with four}} masts to hoist the {{auxiliary}} sails. The sails {{were not just}} to provide auxiliary propulsion, but also were used in rough seas to keep the ship {{on an even keel}} and ensure that both paddle wheels remained in the water, driving the ship in a straight line. The hull was built of oak by traditional methods. She was the largest steamship for one year, until the British and American's British Queen went into service. Built at the shipyard of Patterson & Mercer in Bristol, Great Western was launched on 19 July 1837 and then sailed to London, where she was fitted with two side-lever steam engines from the firm of Maudslay, Sons & Field, producing 750 <b>indicated</b> <b>horsepower</b> between them. The ship proved satisfactory in service and initiated the transatlantic route, acting as a model for all following Atlantic paddle-steamers.|$|E

Popov sent the drawings to the Dutch naval architect Bruno Tideman, who ran {{a series of tests}} of a paraffin wax model in a ship model basin and concluded that the design was feasible. According to Tideman, the ship could reach 14 knots with 8,500 <b>indicated</b> <b>horsepowers,</b> below Popov's earlier estimate of at least 10 thousand horsepower (the first Livadia could make 13 knots on mere 460 horsepower).

Both were christened in front of large crowds by the wife of Francisco Régis de Oliveira, the Brazilian ambassador to the United Kingdom. After fitting-out, the period after a warship's launch where it is completed, Minas Geraes was put through multiple trials of the speed, endurance, efficiency, and weaponry of the ship in September, including what {{was at that time}} the heaviest broadside ever fired off a warship, Minas Geraes was completed and handed over to Brazil on 5 January 1910.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1879, the {{drawings}} were sent to Sir William Pearce of John Elder & Co. Pearce agreed to build it, and in August Tsar Alexander II gave his assent. Pearce {{and the head of}} the Baltic Shipyard Mikhail Casi, representing Alexander II, signed the contract on September 5, 1879. Pearce agreed to complete the job by July 1, 1880. The deal excluded interior finishes, to be completed in Russia. Unusually for the period, Pearce agreed to guarantee the speed of an experimental craft. According to the contract, the full price was payable only if the ship attained 15 knots. Under-performance was punishable by hefty liquidated damages, and the Russians reserved the right for a full money back guarantee if the ship failed to make 14 knots. They agreed to pay generous premiums if speed and engine power exceeded design targets of 15 knots and 12,000 <b>indicated</b> <b>horsepowers.</b> Pearce was instructed to build his own state-of-the-art steam engines, with no cap on maximum power output. The Russians subscribed to supply the complete electrical system, including arc lighting by Yablochkov candles. The British press discussed the unusual project and concluded it was a test bed for future military ships and their powerplants in particular.|$|R
