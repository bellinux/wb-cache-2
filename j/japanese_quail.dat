5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Japanese breeders began to {{selectively}} breed for increased egg production. By 1940, the quail egg industry was flourishing, but {{the events of}} World War II led to {{the complete loss of}} quail lines bred for their song type, as well as almost all of those bred for egg production. After the war, the few surviving domesticated quail were used to rebuild the industry, and all current commercial and laboratory lines are considered to have originated from this population. Modern birds can lay upward of 300 eggs a year and countries such as Japan, India, China, Italy, Russia, and the United States have established commercial <b>Japanese</b> <b>quail</b> farming industries. <b>Japanese</b> <b>quail</b> are also used in biomedical research in fields such as genetics, embryology, nutrition, physiology, pathology, and toxicity studies. These quail are closely related to the common quail, and many young hybrid birds are released into the wild each year to replenish dwindling wild populations.|$|E
5|$|The quail is a {{small to}} medium-sized, cryptically {{coloured}} bird. In its natural environment, it is found in bushy places, in rough grassland, among agricultural crops, and in other places with dense cover. It feeds on seeds, insects, and other small invertebrates. Being a largely ground-dwelling, gregarious bird, domestication of the quail was not difficult, although many of its wild instincts are retained in captivity. It was known to the Egyptians long {{before the arrival of}} chickens and was depicted in hieroglyphs from 2575 BC. It migrated across Egypt in vast flocks and the birds could sometimes be picked up off the ground by hand. These were the common quail (Coturnix coturnix), but modern domesticated flocks are mostly of <b>Japanese</b> <b>quail</b> (Coturnix japonica) which was probably domesticated as early as the 11th century AD in Japan. They were originally kept as songbirds, and they are thought to have been regularly used in song contests.|$|E

40|$|<b>Japanese</b> <b>quails</b> {{are widely}} used for {{experiments}} are models of birds, such as chickens, and are becoming increasingly important in research fields today. Their experimental usefulness was initially reported in an international journal for academic research by Padgett et al. and Wilson et al. in 1959, and, since then, {{a large number of}} researchers in- and outside Japan have conducted surveys and studies to examine their characteristics. In Japan, the first study on <b>Japanese</b> <b>quails</b> with a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research was conducted in 1966, followed by a large number of studies examining them.

25|$|Although {{it is easy}} {{to assume}} that each of these traits was uniquely {{selected}} for by hunter-gatherers and early farmers, beginning in 1959 Dmitry Belyayev tested the reactions of silver foxes to a hand placed in their cage and selected the tamest, least aggressive individuals to breed. His hypothesis was that, by selecting a behavioral trait, he could also influence the phenotype of subsequent generations, making them more domestic in appearance. Over the next 40 years, he succeeded in producing foxes with traits that were never directly selected for, including piebald coats floppy ears, upturned tails, shortened snouts, and shifts in developmental timing. In the 1980s, a researcher used a set of behavioral, cognitive, and visible phenotypic markers, such as coat colour, to produce domesticated fallow deer within a few generations. Similar results for tameness and fear have been found for mink and <b>Japanese</b> <b>quail.</b> In addition to demonstrating that domestic phenotypic traits could arise through selection for a behavioral trait, and domestic behavioral traits could arise through the selection for a phenotypic trait, these experiments provided a mechanism to explain how the animal domestication process could have begun without deliberate human forethought and action.|$|E

2500|$|The beak is a complex, {{functional}} organ with {{an extensive}} nervous supply including nociceptors that sense pain and noxious stimuli. [...] These {{would almost certainly}} be stimulated during beak trimming, indicating strongly that acute pain would be experienced. Behavioural evidence of pain after beak trimming in layer hen chicks {{has been based on}} the observed reduction in pecking behavior, reduced activity and social behavior, and increased sleep duration. [...] In <b>Japanese</b> <b>quail,</b> beak-trimming by cauterization caused lower body weights and feed intake in the period just after beak trimming. [...] Beak trimmed Muscovy ducks spent less time engaging in beak-related behaviours (preening, feeding, drinking, exploratory pecking) and more time resting than non-trimmed ducks in the days immediately post-trim. These differences disappeared by 1 week post-trim. At 1 week post-trim the trimmed ducks weighed less than non-trimmed ducks, but this difference disappeared by 2 weeks post-trim. [...] It is, however, unclear if the above changes in behaviour arise from pain or from a loss of sensitivity in the beak. [...] Pecking force has been found to decrease after beak trimming in adult hens possibly indicating that hens are protecting a painful area from further stimulation. However, pecking force did not differ between chicks with or without minor beak-trims at 2 to 9 days of age, suggesting that chicks with minor beak-trims do not experience pain from the beak.|$|E

Diets were formulated with corn, soybean meal, sorghum and wheat bran containing 20. 0 % crude protein and 2, 800 kcal ME/kg. The basal diet contained suboptimal level of lysine equal to 1 % and was supplemented with five levels of L-arginine 99 % (0. 032; 0. 083; 0. 134; 0. 185 and 0. 236 %) to replace the glutamic acid, corresponding to the relationship of arginine with digestible lysine of 1. 16, 1. 21, 1. 26, 1. 31 and 1. 36. The parameters studied were: feed intake, egg production per hen/day, egg production per hen housed, commercial egg production, egg weight, egg mass, feed conversion by egg mass, feed conversion per dozen eggs, weight and percentage of components of the eggs (yolk, albumen and shell) and specific gravity. There was no significant effect on the relationship of arginine with digestible lysine in the diet of <b>Japanese</b> <b>quails</b> for any of the parameters examined.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of three levels of threonine (100, 95 and 90 % of NRC requirements) with or without of multi strains probiotic (Primalac) on performance, carcass characteristics and blood metabolites of <b>Japanese</b> <b>quails.</b> A total of 180 one-day-old male <b>Japanese</b> <b>quails</b> were randomly allocated to six treatments with three replicates and 10 birds per each. The experiment was done from 0 to 6 weeks of age. Growth performance traits including weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio were recorded. At the end of the experiment, six birds per treatment were slaughtered and carcass characteristics were measured. Blood sampling was taken at 42 days of age. The results of this study indicated that supplementation of probiotic did not affect feed intake, weight gain and feed conversion ratio in quails. In contrast, feed conversion ratio was improved in birds fed with 100 % of threonine requirements. All carcass traits, except for liver weight, were not influenced by threonine levels and dietary probiotic supplementation. The liver percentage was higher in birds fed diets without the probiotic. The results showed that serum glucose was affected by threonine levels. However, the other blood metabolites such as cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoproteins and low-density lipoproteins were not influenced by the threonine levels. In this regard, none of the blood metabolites were influenced by probiotic supplement, except for cholesterol. In conclusions, the supplementation of probiotic did not affect growth performance in <b>Japanese</b> <b>quails.</b> However, use of threonine at 100 % NRC requirements improved feed efficiency in <b>Japanese</b> <b>quails...</b>|$|R
