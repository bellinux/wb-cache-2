40|$|We {{study the}} {{material}} requirement planning (MRP) system nervousness problem from a dynamic, stochastic and economic perspective in a two-echelon supply chain under first order auto-regressive demand. MRP nervousness is an effect where the future order forecasts, given to suppliers {{so that they may}} plan production and organize their affairs, exhibits extreme period-to-period variability. We develop a measure of nervousness that weights future forecast errors geometrically over time. Near-term forecast errors are weighted higher than distant forecast errors. Focusing on replenishment policies for high volume items, we investigate two methods of generating <b>order</b> <b>call-offs</b> and two methods of creating <b>order</b> forecasts. <b>For</b> <b>order</b> <b>call-offs,</b> we consider the traditional order-up-to (OUT) policy and the proportional OUT policy (POUT). For order forecasts, we study both minimum mean square error (MMSE) forecasts of the demand process and MMSE forecasts coupled with a procedure that accounts for the known future influence of the POUT policy. We show that when retailers use the POUT policy and account for its predictable future behavior, they can reduce the bullwhip effect, supply chain inventory costs and the manufacturer’s MRP nervousness...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{a concept}} for materials supply called call-off production, {{used by the}} telecom company Ericsson, where a case study was performed. <b>Call-off</b> <b>orders</b> are initiated from the production area and submitted through electronic data interchange (EDI) to an external supplier, a third-party logistics provider, skipping the traditional purchase <b>ordering</b> process. In <b>call-off</b> production Ericsson applies two forms of kanban for triggering the replenishment, namely the conventional kanban card and electronic kanban. <b>For</b> both variants, <b>call-off</b> production implies a short lead time, frequent deliveries, {{and the potential for}} controlling tied-up capital, using few resources, and providing a high level of delivery service. The study indicates that the conventional kanban card requires more handling than electronic kanban. On the other hand, electronic kanban could hide problems in the stock. To conduct the analysis, a theoretical framework and an analysis model were created as a foundation. Call-off production could be an uncomplicated and efficient method for manufacturing companies to manage some of the purchased products. This study’s intended contribution is to increase the knowledge of a supply model in practice...|$|R
5000|$|A blanket order, blanket {{purchase}} agreement or <b>call-off</b> <b>order</b> [...] is a purchase order which a customer places with its supplier to allow multiple delivery dates {{over a period}} of time, often negotiated to take advantage of predetermined pricing. It is normally used when there is a recurring need for expendable goods. Blanket orders are often used when a customer buys large quantities and has obtained special discounts. Based on the blanket order, sales orders ('blanket releases' or 'release orders') and invoice items can be created as needed until the contract is fulfilled, the end of the order period is reached or a pre-determined maximum order value is reached.|$|R
