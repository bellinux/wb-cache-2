The principal mode of fracture is radial cracking at the undersurface of the <b>inner</b> (<b>core)</b> <b>layer,</b> even in the strongest of core ceramics—other damage modes, including radial cracking in the outer (veneer) layer, are less invasive in these all-brittle coating systems. Tests on simple trilayer structures fabricated from glasses, sapphire, and dental ce-ramics are {{used to examine the}} dependence of the critical load for radial fracture in terms of relative outer/inner layer thickness and modulus, and inner layer strength. An explicit relation for the critical load, based on a flexing plate model in which the outer/inner bilayer is reduced to an “equiva-lent ” monolithic coating with “effective ” composite modu-lus, is used to examine these dependencies. The theoretical relation describes all the major trends in the critical load data over a broad range of variables, thus providing a sound basis for trilayer design.

Multiple recent missions have mapped the global lunar gravity field, each one improving upon the resolution of the last. The details of the Moon's deepest structure, including the parameters that define the lunar core, however, were still largely unaddressed by pre-GRAIL gravity measurements, which were not high enough resolution to resolve the tidal coefficients at a sufficient degree of accuracy. Current constraints on core size and state arise from other indirect measurements, including lunar laser ranging, magnetic induction studies, and analyses of elemental abundances in depth-derived mare basalts. These inferences vary widely, but when considered together with structure models derived from the seismic data gathered during the Apollo missions, a schematic of the lunar interior containing a partially molten deepest mantle layer overlying molten outer and solid <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> <b>layers</b> was obtained. Seismology provides the most direct constraints on the variables that govern the dynamic properties of the body. However, the GRAIL mission's high-resolution measurements of the lunar gravity field are being used to constrain the interior structure of the Moon using a "crust to core" approach. GRAIL's constraints on crustal thickness, mantle structure, core radius and stratification, and core state (solid vs. molten) therefore complement seismic investigations.

Water {{splitting}} using photocatalyst has become a topic of recent investigation since {{it has the potential}} of producing hydrogen for clean energy from sunlight. An extensive number of solid photocatalysts have been studied for overall water splitting in recent years. In this study, two methods were employed to synthesize two different photocatalysts for water splitting. The first method describes the synthesis of nickel oxide-loaded strontium titanate (NiO-SrTiO 3) particles on electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers incorporated with graphene nanoplatelets for water splitting. The electrospun PAN fibers were first oxidized at 270 degrees C for two hours and subsequently immersed in a solution containing ethanol, titanium (IV) -isopropoxide [C 12 H 28 O 4 Ti] and strontium nitrate [Sr(NO 3) (2) ]. This solution was then treated with NiO nanoparticles dispersed in toluene. The surface treated PAN fibers were annealed at 600 degrees C in air for 1 hour to transform fibers into a crystalline form for improved photocatalyst performance. In the second method, coaxial electrospinning process was used to produce core/shell strontium titanate/nickel oxide (SrTiO 3 -NiO) nanofibers.

This <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> <b>layer</b> surrounded by VP 6, the major capsid protein, constitutes double-layered particles that are transcriptionally active. Each gene encoding a structural protein of double-layered particles has been cloned into baculovirus recombinants and expressed in insect cells. Previously, we showed that coexpression of different combinations of the structural proteins of rotavirus double-layered particles results {{in the formation of}} virus-like particles (VLPs), and each VLP containing VP 1, the presumed RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, possesses replicase activity as assayed in an in vitro template-dependent assay system (C. Q. -Y. Zeng, M. J. Wentz, J. Cohen, M. E. Estes, and R. F. Ramig, J. Virol. 70 : 2736 – 2742, 1996). This work reports construction and characterization of VLPs containing a truncated VP 2 (VPΔ 2, containing amino acids [aa] Met- 93 to 880). Expression of VPΔ 2 alone resulted in the formation of single-layered Δ 2 -VLPs. Coexpression of VPΔ 2 with VP 6 produced double-layered Δ 2 / 6 -VLPs. VLPs formed by coexpression of VPΔ 2 and VP 1 or VP 3, or both VP 1 and VP 3, resulted in the formation of VLPs lacking both VP 1 and VP 3. The presence of VP 6 with VPΔ 2 did not result in encapsidation of VP 1 and VP 3. To determine the domain of VP 2 required for binding VP 1, far-Western blot analyses using a series of truncated VP 2 constructs were performed to test their ability to bind VP 1. These analyses showed that (i) full-length VP 2 (aa 1 to 880) binds to VP 1, (ii) any N-terminal truncation lacking aa 1 to 25 fails to bind VP 1, and (iii) a C-terminal 296 -aa truncated VP 2 construct (aa 1 to 583) maintains the ability to bind VP 1.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 185 - 194. Electromagnetic {{wave propagation}} in metamaterial structures (metamaterial slabs, metamaterial cylinders, metamaterial coated conducting cylinders etc.) are investigated. Scattered and transmitted electromagnetic fields by these structures due to electric line sources or plane wave illuminations are found. A generic formulation of these wave propagation problems is done, enabling {{any kind of}} metamaterial or conventional material to be used, having any sign combination of constitutive parameters and having any electric and/or magnetic losses. For one of these propagation problems i. e., metamaterial coated conducting cylinders illuminated normally with plane waves, achieving transparency and maximizing scattering are investigated thoroughly. It is found out that, rigorous derivation of transparency and resonance (scattering maximization) conditions for PEC core cylinder case under the sub-wavelength limitations yields the same conditions of two electrically small concentric layers of conjugately paired cylinders, given in the literature (when the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> <b>layer</b> is also taken to the PEC limit). These transparency and resonance conditions {{are found to be}} heavily dependent on the permittivity of the metamaterial coating (for TE polarization) and the ratio of core-shell radii. The relations between the permittivity of the coating and the ratio of core-shell radii are investigated for achieving transparency and scattering maximization. Numerical results show that these analytical relations are quite successful and work better when the cylindrical scatter is electrically very small. A novel homogenization method for the retrieval of effective constitutive parameters of metamaterials is proposed and implemented. The method is based on the simple idea that the total reflection coefficient from a finite metamaterial structure has to resemble the reflection from an homogeneous equivalent. While implementing the method, 1, 2,..., 20 unit cells of the same metamaterial structure are stacked and their reflection coefficients are collected. The homogenization quality of the metamaterial is evaluated in terms of various factors, which showed that the method is very successful to retrieve the effective constitutive parameters of the metamaterial. Finally, another method has been proposed for the retrieval of surface wave propagation constants on any periodic or non-periodic grounded slab medium. As a preliminary, the method is applied to grounded dielectric slabs. The numerical results generally show good agreement with their theoretical counterparts. Ircı, ErdinçM. S...|$|E

We propose here a general analysis of the thermal evolution of the <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> Whether the geotherm in the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> is superadiabatic or not depends on the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> solidification rate, on the thermal diffusivity of iron at <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> conditions, and on {{the ratio of the}} Clapeyron slope to the adiabatic gradient in the <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> The temperature field within the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> can be destabilizing - and could drive convection - if the growth rate of the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> is large enough. The effect of radiogenic heating is probably small, and, perhaps surprisingly, can even stabilize the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> against convection. The uncertainties are such that it is not possible at present to conclude about the likelihood of thermal convection in the <b>inner</b> <b>core,</b> but recent estimates of the Core Mantle Boundary (CMB) heat flux and <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> conductivity favour convection. Thermal convection is more likely early in the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> history, a consequence of the secular decrease in cooling rate of the core. In addition, solidification-induced partitioning of the light elements may induce a stable density stratification within the <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> We develop a numerical model of thermo-chemical convection in a growing <b>inner</b> <b>core,</b> which couples the evolution and {{dynamics of}} the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> with the thermal and compositional evolution of the outer core. Melting and crystallization associated with deformation of the <b>Inner</b> <b>Core</b> Boundary (ICB) would be of importance for the style of convection if the viscosity is large, but we focus here on the case of low viscosity for which phase change associated with dynamic topography at the ICB is expected to play a secondary role. In this regime, convection is typical of high Rayleigh number internally heated convection, with cold plumes falling from the ICB. Several possible scenarios can lead to a <b>layered</b> <b>inner</b> <b>core,</b> either because of cessation of thermal convection due to the decrease in cooling rate of the core, or because of a compositional stratification which can confine convection in the deep <b>inner</b> <b>core,</b> or stabilize the whole <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> For each of these scenarios, it is possible to find plausible sets of parameters (<b>inner</b> <b>core</b> age, viscosity, magnitude of the compositional stratification) for which the radius at which convection stops corresponds to the radius of the seismically inferred innermost <b>inner</b> <b>core...</b>|$|R

If the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> is unstably stratified, linear stability analysis and numerical simulations consistently show that the translation mode dominates only if the viscosity η is large enough, with a critical viscosity value, of order 3 10 ^ 18 Pas, depending on the ability of outer core convection to supply or remove the latent heat of melting or solidification. If η is smaller, the dynamical effect of melting and freezing is small.

We also observed evidence for a lateral velocity gradient {{in this part of}} the <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> Assuming that the temporal changes result from a shift of a lateral structure due to an <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> rotation, we estimate the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> rotation rate to be about 0. 41 ± 0. 12 ◦ yr− 1 faster than the mantle.

Sub-solidus convection was one of the early suggestions to explain the seismic anisotropy but requires an unstable density gradient either from thermal or compositional origin, or both.

The compositional stratification results from a competition of the increase of the concentration in O and S in the outer <b>core</b> with <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> growth, which makes the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> concentration also increase, and of the decrease of the liquidus which makes the partition coefficient decrease as well as the concentration of light elements in the solid.

40|$|Understanding the {{composition}} of Earth’s <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> is crucial for revealing the mechanisms of core formation {{and the evolution of}} Earth. The presence of light elements in the Earth’s <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> has been indicated in recent studies, based on the mismatch between the observed density of the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> and the density of pure iron at relevant conditions. The nature and abundance of light element(s) are under debate, yet they are fundamental in understanding the formation and evolution of the Earth’s core. Carbon has been considered a possible major light element candidate, besides hydrogen, oxygen, silicon and sulphur. In particular, Fe 3 C has been proposed to be the major component in the Earth’s <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> in a previous thermodynamics study. However, the possibility of Fe 3 C being a major <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> component has been under debate in recent studies, largely due to our limited knowledge of the properties of Fe 3 C at extreme pressure and temperature (P-T) conditions. In this thesis work, I investigated the possibility of carbon as a principal light element in the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> in the form of Fe 3 C. Considering the lack of direct accessibility to the <b>inner</b> <b>core,</b> the only way to test a carbon-rich <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> model is to compare the properties of iron-carbon compounds, including the density and sound velocities, with the observed values of <b>inner</b> <b>core...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Earth's <b>inner</b> <b>core,</b> the slowly growing {{sphere of}} solid iron alloy at {{the centre of}} our planet, is known to exhibit seismic anisotropy. Both normal mode and body wave studies have {{established}} that, when the global average is taken, compressional waves propagate faster in the North-South direction than in the equatorial plane. Recent body wave studies also indicate that this fast direction may be more attenuating, and interpret this anisotropic attenuation in terms of anisotropic scattering due to <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> texturing. Here we use the Earth's normal modes to study the attenuation anisotropy of both compressional and shear waves in the <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> As normal modes have wavelengths several orders of magnitude longer than estimates of <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> grain size, any attenuation anisotropy quantified using normal modes must reflect the anisotropy of intrinsic (viscoelastic) attenuation of the crystalline <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> alloy. By inverting zonal anelastic and elastic normal mode splitting function coefficients of twenty <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> sensitive modes, we construct models of <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> intrinsic attenuation and velocity anisotropy. We find that, for compressional waves, the North-South direction is both fast and more strongly attenuating. The existence of intrinsic <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> attenuation anisotropy can be interpreted in terms of anisotropic Zener relaxation in the metallic alloy comprising the <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> Such anisotropic Zener relaxation has only been observed {{in the presence of}} solute atoms, and is thus entirely consistent with the presence of a few atomic per cent of light elements in the Earth's <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|Slichter modes {{refer to}} the {{translational}} motion of the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> {{with respect to the}} outer core and the mantle [Slichter, L., 1961. The fundamental free mode of the Earth’s <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 47, 186 – 190].

Geophys. Res. 79, 753 – 757] presented an analysis of the polar mode which yielded an expression for its period. Busse’s analysis included the assumption that the mantle was stationary.

50|$|The Earth's <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> {{is thought}} to be slowly growing as the liquid outer core at the {{boundary}} with the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> cools and solidifies due to the gradual cooling of the Earth's interior (about 100 degrees Celsius per billion years). Many scientists had initially expected that the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> would be found to be homogeneous, because the solid <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> was originally formed by a gradual cooling of molten material, and continues to grow {{as a result of that}} same process. Even though it is growing into liquid, it is solid, due to the very high pressure that keeps it compacted together even if the temperature is extremely high. It was even suggested that Earth's <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> might be a single crystal of iron. However, this prediction was disproved by observations indicating that in fact there is a degree of disorder within the <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> Seismologists have found that the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> is not completely uniform, but instead contains large-scale structures such that seismic waves pass more rapidly through some parts of the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> than through others. In addition, the properties of the <b>inner</b> <b>core's</b> surface vary from place to place across distances as small as 1 km. This variation is surprising, since lateral temperature variations along the inner-core boundary are known to be extremely small (this conclusion is confidently constrained by magnetic field observations). Recent discoveries suggest that the solid <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> itself is composed of layers, separated by a transition zone about 250 to 400 km thick. If the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> grows by small frozen sediments falling onto its surface, then some liquid can also be trapped in the pore spaces and some of this residual fluid may still persist to some small degree in much of its interior.|$|R
40|$|We present illustrative {{calculations}} {{of the effect}} of hemispherical variation in <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> anisotropy on Earth's normal modes of oscillation. Body wave studies show that the anisotropy in the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> is not simple cylindrical anisotropy, which is often portrayed in models derived from normal mode data, but varies with longitude. 'Hemispherical' or odd degree, structure has to be studied by cross-coupling normal modes, as the self-coupling technique is sensitive only to even degree Earth structure. A completely general definition of <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> anisotropy would require a prohibitive number of degrees of freedom; however, we show that any existing cylindrical anisotropy model can be confined to only one part of the <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> Using our new theory, we find that hemispherical anisotropy causes significant changes in the frequency and quality factor of several <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> sensitive normal modes. The effect of hemispherical <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> anisotropy can also be seen in synthetic seismograms. Radial, PKIKP and PKJKP modes all respond to the presence of hemispherical variation in <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> anisotropy. If the variations in <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> anisotropy seen in body wave data are part of a gross, large-scale pattern, then this structure should also affect normal mode data on an observable scale. © Journal compilation © 2009 RAS...|$|R
40|$|In a first {{approximation}} the Earth's interior has an isotropic {{structure with}} a spherical symmetry. Over {{the last decades}} the geophysical observations have revealed, at different spatial scales, the existence of several perturbations from this basic structure.

One of the best documented perturbations is the asymmetry {{at the top of the}} <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> (ATIC) characterized by faster seismic wave velocity in the eastern hemisphere than in the western hemisphere. All existing explanations are based on a hemispheric variation of the material properties near ICB inside the <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> Using numerical simulations of the seismic ray propagation, we show that the ATIC can be explained as well by the displacement of the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> towards east in the equatorial plane tens of kilometers from the Earth's center, without modifying the spherical symmetry in the upper <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> The hypothesis of a displaced <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> is also sustained by other observed hemispheric asymmetries at the top of the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> and at the bottom of the outer <b>core.</b> A displaced <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> would have major implications for many mechanical, thermal, and magnetic phenomena in the Earth's interior.
