The sub-nanometre precision of fitting was reached with this new robust and fast algorithm. The algorithm also does not need precise estimation of parameters for the initial iteration. It allows ISO 10110 characterization with the conic section parameters of surfaces that are rotated and translated as it is common in the data output from measurement devices and alignment markers on lens are not needed. The additional criterion for residuals can effectively remove unuseful data to keep results for the main part of aperture unaffected by local imperfections. Moreover, the part of algorithm that finds the correct coordinate system and removes outliers can be used independently on the conic section <b>fitting</b> <b>part.</b> Thus the algorithm will be useful for the optical community for precise characterisation and testing of aspheric lens.|$|E

40|$|Total ozone {{retrieval}} algorithms applied operationally to GOME and SCIAMACHY {{data have}} been based on the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique for several years. These algorithms produce retrieval results within the 1 % precision level in low- and mid-latitude regions.

We use the Direct <b>Fitting</b> <b>part</b> of the GODFIT software to investigate these total ozone retrieval issues in the polar regions. Sensitivity tests show the influence on the ozone columns of key input parameters such as cloud parameters (FRESCO or OCRA-ROCINN), O 3 climatology (TOMS v 8 or DOC), surface albedo, and temperature profile data bases. The two SAUNA campaigns in Sodankylä (67 ° N, 26 ° E) provide good opportunities to validate our algorithm in polar regions.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} issues in the material handling of compliant objects is excessive part deformation. The deformation of compliant sheet metal parts during the handling process can significantly impact both part dimensional quality and production rate. Increasing production rate while maintaining part quality requires an optimal design of the part transfer trajectory. This paper describes a new methodology of time-optimal trajectory planning for compliant parts by discretizing the part transfer path into N segments that have equal horizontal distance and by approximating the trajectory as having piecewise constant acceleration that can only change its value {{at the end of each}} segment. The contribution of the methodology is that part deformation determined by transfer velocity and acceleration is considered as a nonlinear constraint, which is obtained from FEA simulation and model <b>fitting.</b> <b>Part</b> permanent deformation, trajectory smoothness, and static obstacle avoidance are also considered. The methodology is validated by simulations at different motion conditions and obstacle configurations. This paper addresses the lack of current design guidelines for material handing development and simultaneously provides a mathematical tool to significantly enhance the production efficiency in manufacturing of compliant sheet metal parts...|$|E

Our techniques {{will be based on}} the extraction and matching of perceptually relevant shape features, thereby overcoming many of the limitations of existing methods. This project will develop and evaluate new algorithms for: • Perceptual segmentation of raw images, and grouping of shape elements. • Matching of geometrical patterns representing shape features. • Partial matching: <b>fitting</b> <b>part</b> of one shape with part of another. • Indexing shape features in huge databases of figurative images. • Indexing the relative spatial layout of shape features within these images. The project meets the objectives of the FET programme through a highly-innovative (and hence high-risk) programme to develop novel techniques for shape matching aimed at tackling one of the key problems limiting the effectiveness of current image retrieval techniques. Our project offers the possibility of significant advances at both the scientific and economic level. New in our approach is the primary role of perceptually relevant shape features, the emphasis on the unsolved problem of partial matching, and indexing over lay-out and shapes rather than over feature vectors. The newly developed algorithms will be experimentally verified in a prototype system, and subjected to rigorous evaluation on databases with independently-validated ground truth. 2.

40|$|To most interpreters, {{the case}} {{seems to be}} clear: Plotinus {{identifies}} matter and evil, as he bluntly states in Enn. I. 8 [51] that ‘last matter’ is ‘evil’, and even ‘evil itself’. In this paper, I challenge this view: how and why should Plotinus have thought of matter, the sense-making έσχατον of his derivational ontology from the One and Good, evil? A rational reconstruction of Plotinus’s tenets should neither accept the paradox that evil comes from Good, nor shirk the arduous task of interpreting Plotinus’s texts on evil as a <b>fitting</b> <b>part</b> of his philosophy on the whole. Therefore, I suggest a reading of evil in Plotinus as the outcome of an incongruent interaction of matter and soul, maintaining simultaneously that neither soul nor matter are to be considered as bad or evil. When Plotinus calls matter evil, he does so metonymically denoting matter’s totally passive potentiality as perceived by the toiling soul trying to act upon it as a form-bringer. As so often, Plotinus is speaking quoad nos here rather than referring to ‘matter per se’ (for Plotinus, somewhat of an oxymoron) which, as mere potentiality (and nothing else) is not nor can be evil. In short: matter is no more evil than the melancholy evening sky is melancholy – not in itself (for it isn’t), but as to its impression on us who contemplate it. As I buttress this view, it will also become clear that matter cannot tritely {{be considered to be}} the αυτό κακόν as a prima facie-reading of Enn. I. 8 [51] might powerfully suggest, but that the αυτό κακόν, far from being a principle of its own, has to be interpreted within the dynamics of Plotinus’s philosophical thinking as a unique, though numerously applicable flaw-pattern for all the single kakã (hence the Platonic aÈtÒ). To conclude, I shall offer a short outlook on the consistency of this interpretation with Plotinus’s teaching on the soul and with the further Neoplatonic development of the doctrine of evil. ...|$|E
