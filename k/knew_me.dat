[...] He believed that his actions were justifiable because he had undertaken them in his duty as schoolteacher. He portrayed himself as a victim of public opinion, claiming that [...] "a mournful accident was swelled up into a bloody midnight murder, and how it has been brought about that my unfortunate name has been branded, not simply through the United Kingdom, but through the civilised world, {{as one of the most}} execrable monsters or of madmen."

He listed [...] "Thunder" [...] in his top four tracks to {{download}} from I Am, along with [...] "Another Love Song, [...] "Power" [...] and [...] "I Got You". Both Kathy Iandoli and Robbie Daw of Idolator praised [...] "Thunder": the former described the track as [...] "equally anthemic" [...] as [...] "Fire Under My Feet" [...] while the latter wrote that it is a [...] "soulful, soaring ballad" [...] which, as with many of Lewis' songs, is difficult not to get immersed in with its strong emotional sentiment. Knoxville News Sentinel writer Chuck Campbell highlighted it as one of the albums many great tracks, writing [...] "Lewis lassoes the rumbling beat of opener 'Thunder' to announce her return – and she’s off from there." [...] Next Magazine writer Benjamin Lindsay picked [...] "Thunder" [...] as a [...] "standout" [...] song on I Am, along with [...] "Fire Under My Feet", [...] "The Essence of Me" [...] and [...] "You <b>Knew</b> <b>Me</b> When".

"This Kiss" [...] {{was written}} by Jepsen, Kelly Covell, Matthew Koma, and Stefan Kendal Gordy, also known as Redfoo from electropop duo LMFAO, through e-mails, text {{messaging}} and telephone calls. Jepsen explained that she had [...] "never written a song that way before so I'd definitely say it was new," [...] adding that [...] "there was something really exciting about being {{on the phone and}} singing ideas to each other and then calling each other back and re-writing lyrics in your BlackBerry and iPhone and seeing it all being exchanged." [...] The singer also revealed that she was pleased with the creative process of the song, commenting that [...] "despite all this craziness, [...] remains the same. And that same exciting feeling that I had before anybody <b>knew</b> <b>me,</b> when I was just beginning to work on 'Call Me Maybe', is the same feeling I had today with Redfoo from LMFAO. You can sense the people who really have it are about writing that right word or that right melody to make it lift and make you feel that perfect emotion." [...] "This Kiss" [...] was recorded at Party Rock Studio with Redfoo in 2012 after Redfoo recorded ideas at Sonic Vista Studios Ibiza, Spain, and was released as the second single from Kiss on September 10, 2012. [...] "This Kiss" [...] is a mid-tempo dance-pop track which lyrically speaks about a kiss being something Jepsen can't resist and the lips of her beloved, featuring lyrics such as [...] "This kiss is something I can't resist/ Your lips are undeniable/This kiss is something I can't risk/Your heart is unreliable" [...] during the chorus. Carl Williot of Idolator compared the lyrics to the ones of Hall & Oates' [...] "Kiss on My List" [...] (1981).|$|E
