5|$|The {{small round}} yellow fruit ripen and turn red {{at any time}} of year, {{although}} they peak in autumn and winter (April to July). Known as a syconium, the fruit is an inverted inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity. Ficusobliqua is pollinated by two species of fig wasp—Pleistodontes greenwoodi and P.xanthocephalus. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various passerines, eat the fruit. The range is along the east coast from Queensland, through New South Wales in rainforest, savanna woodland, sclerophyll forest and gallery forest. It is used as a shade tree in parks and public spaces, and is well-suited for use as an <b>indoor</b> <b>plant</b> or in bonsai. All parts of the tree have been used in traditional medicine in Fiji.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the palms}} {{that are the}} {{signature}} plants of the island as the kentia and curly palms especially dominate the landscape in many places, the kentia being of special economic importance. All four species are endemic to the island, often occurring in dense pure stands, {{the one that has}} proved such a worldwide success as an <b>indoor</b> <b>plant</b> being the kentia or thatch palm (Howea forsteriana). This is a lowland palm with drooping leaflets and seed branches in 'hands' of 3–5 while the curly palm (Howea belmoreana), which occurs on slightly higher ground, has upwardly directed leaflets and solitary 'hands'. Natural hybrids between these species occur on the island and there is a mature specimen of one growing in the island nursery. On the mountain sides higher than about 350 m there is the big mountain palm (Hedyscepe canterburyana); it has large golf-ball-sized fruits while the little mountain palm (Lepidorrhachis mooreana) has marble-sized fruits and is only found on the mountain summits.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to report the effects of window views and <b>indoor</b> <b>plants</b> on human psychophysiological {{response}} in workplace environments. The effects of window views and <b>indoor</b> <b>plants</b> were recorded by measuring participant's electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), blood volume pulse (BVP), and state-anxiety. Photo Impact 5. 0 was used to simulate the environment in an office, where six conditions were examined: 1) window with a view of a city, 2) window with a view of a city and <b>indoor</b> <b>plants,</b> 3) window with a view of nature, 4) window with a view of nature and <b>indoor</b> <b>plants,</b> 5) office without a window view, and 6) office without a window view and <b>indoor</b> <b>plants.</b> Participants were less nervous or anxious when watching a view of nature and/or when <b>indoor</b> <b>plants</b> were present.

5|$|The fruits are small, {{round and}} yellow, and can ripen and turn red {{at any time}} of year, peaking in spring and summer. Like all figs, the fruit {{is in the form of}} a syconium, an {{inverted}} inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity. F.rubiginosa is exclusively pollinated by the fig wasp species Pleistodontes imperialis, which may comprise four cryptospecies. The syconia are also home to another fourteen species of wasp, some of which induce galls while others parasitise the pollinator wasps, and at least two species of nematode. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various passerines, eat the fruit. Ranging along the Australian east coast from Queensland to Bega in southern New South Wales (including the Port Jackson area, leading to its alternative name), F.rubiginosa grows in rainforest margins and rocky outcrops. It is used as a shade tree in parks and public spaces, and when potted is well-suited for use as an <b>indoor</b> <b>plant</b> or in bonsai.|$|E
25|$|Although their root {{buttressing}} is {{a potential}} feature, the Moreton Bay fig is poorly suited to bonsai as their large leaves do not reduce much in size and they have long internodal growth.

25|$|Seeds grow well in {{a compost}} or potting soil mix – even as a potted <b>indoor</b> <b>plant.</b> Pitaya cacti usually {{germinate}} after between 11 and 14 days after shallow planting. As they are cacti, overwatering is a concern for home growers. As their growth continues, these climbing plants will find something to climb on, which can involve putting aerial roots down from the branches {{in addition to the}} basal roots. Once the plant reaches a mature 10 pounds in weight, the plant may flower.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>indoor</b> <b>plants</b> on <b>indoor</b> {{environmental}} conditions is often underestimated or ignored while undertaking building simulation performance assessments.

40|$|Objective: Natural {{elements}} in the built healthcare environment have shown to hold potential stress-reducing properties. In order {{to shed light on}} the underlying mechanism of stress-reducing effects of nature, the present study investigates whether the stress-reducing effects of <b>indoor</b> <b>plants</b> occur because such an environment is perceived as being more attractive. Method: A single-factor between-subjects experimental design (nature: <b>indoor</b> <b>plants</b> vs. no plants) was used in which participants (n = 77) were presented with a scenario describing hospitalization with a possible legionella diagnosis. The study was conducted from March to May 2007 in the Netherlands. Subsequently, they were exposed to a photo of a hospital room. In this room were either <b>indoor</b> <b>plants,</b> or there was a painting of an urban environment on the wall. Afterwards, perceived stress and the perceived attractiveness of the hospital room were measured. Results: Participants exposed to the hospital room with <b>indoor</b> <b>plants</b> reported less stress than those in the control condition. Mediation analysis confirmed that <b>indoor</b> <b>plants</b> in a hospital room reduce feelings of stress through the perceived attractiveness of the room. Conclusion: This study confirms the stress-reducing properties of natural {{elements in}} the built healthcare environment. It also sheds light on the underlying mechanism causing this stress-reduction. ...|$|R
500|$|Ficus obliqua is {{an elegant}} shade tree for parks or fields, and is {{adaptable}} to differing soils. A notable specimen in Mick Ryan Park, Milton on the New South Wales south coast stands [...] tall and [...] across, {{and is a}} local landmark. [...] Like other fig species that grow into large trees, Ficus obliqua is not suitable for any but the largest gardens as its aggressive root system invades drains and garden beds. Fig trees also drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess underfoot. Although it is much less used in bonsai than F. rubiginosa, F. obliqua is well-suited {{for use in the}} medium; its small leaves and trunk's propensity to thicken give it attributes optimal for a tree [...] in height. It is seen in bonsai nurseries mainly in the Brisbane area, where it is a locally common species, and is very highly regarded by at least one proponent, Bradley Barlow. Barlow entered a specimen from Brisbane to the Bonsai Clubs International competition in 2006, winning a prize. It is also suited for use as an <b>indoor</b> <b>plant</b> in low-, medium- or brightly lit indoor spaces. The timber is too soft for use in woodworking.|$|E

40|$|Certain {{decorative}} indoor-plant cultivars {{are derived}} from toxic wild plant species. Native members of the Eupbhrbiaceac (spurge) contain highly irritating and tumor-promoting diterpene esters. Plant breeders and gardeners are constanly searcing for less toxic cultivars of the popular Eup/orbiaceat <b>indoor</b> <b>plants.</b> In this investigation, 22 commercial cultivars of Euphorbiaeae <b>indoor</b> <b>plants</b> were examined for tumor promoter contents by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPPLC). Cultivars of E. milii (E. lomii hybrids), and in particular E. kwoneura, contained ingenol derivatives, whereas cultivars of E. pdherma and Codiaum variegaum were devoid of these compounds. Tumor-promoting activity was assessed by induction of a luciferase reporter gene, which was placed {{under the control of}} an Epstein-Barr virs early antigen promoter. The response was dosely correlated with ingenol ester content; the latex of the two Es klconeura cultivars tested gave the strongest response. The HPLC and bioassay methods used in this study provide a basis for the development of nontoxic indoor-plant cultivars and perhaps for consumer-oriented lbeling.
