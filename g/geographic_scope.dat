5|$|Okay Africa {{wrote that}} by its second year, the fair had become Europe's {{foremost}} contemporary African art fair, and Naomi Rea of Artnet News {{called it a}} necessary visit during the London Frieze Art Fair. In New York, Ben Davis of Artnet wrote that 1:54 NY was a highlight of the city's art fair week. Critics had typically questioned whether art fairs with narrow <b>geographic</b> <b>scope</b> like 1:54 highlight or ostracize minority artists. A gallery owner from Seattle saw the fair as a route for further integration into larger markets. Artnet Davis expressed distaste at the art fair trend of lumping artists by their geographic region and generalizing trends based on its parts, but nonetheless considered important 1:54's representation of Africa. Critics initially noted the fair's lack of African gallery representation, but cited justification including the African art scene's nascent state and the continent's history of political instability, which affects both overseas trade and gallery security. At the 2015 New York show, reviewers noted elements including the predominantly white gallery exhibition staff and the marquee display of a popular artist at a fair for marginal artists.|$|E

40|$|Text {{mining and}} search have become {{important}} research areas {{over the past}} few years, mostly due to the large popularity of the Web. A natural extension for these technologies is the development of methods for exploring the geographic context of Web information. Human information needs often present specific geographic constraints. Many Web documents also refer to speci c locations. However, relatively little e ort has been spent on developing the facilities required for geographic access to unstructured textual information. Geographically aware text mining and search remain relatively unexplored. This thesis addresses this new area, arguing that Web text mining can be applied to extract geographic context information, and that this information can be explored for information retrieval. Fundamental questions investigated include handling geographic references in text, assigning <b>geographic</b> <b>scopes</b> to the documents, and building retrieval applications that handle/use <b>geographic</b> <b>scopes.</b> The thesis presents appropriate solutions for each of these challenges, together with a comprehensive evaluation of their efectiveness. By investigating these questions, the thesis presents several findings on how the geographic context can be efectively handled by text processing tools...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes simple {{techniques}} for handling place references in search engine queries, {{an important aspect}} of geographical information retrieval. We address not only the detection, but also the disambiguation of place references, by matching them explicitly with concepts at an ontology. Moreover, when a query does not reference any locations, we propose to use information from documents matching the query, exploiting <b>geographic</b> <b>scopes</b> previously assigned to these documents. Evaluation experiments, using topics from CLEF campaigns and logs from real search engine queries, show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches...|$|R

The competition's organiser, now known as SANZAAR after the Argentine Rugby Union became a full member in 2016, has also expanded Super Rugby in the 21st century, first expanding from 12 to 14 teams in 2006, then to 15 teams in 2011, and most recently to 18 teams in 2016. The last of these expansions spread Super Rugby's <b>geographic</b> <b>scope</b> outside of its founding countries (South Africa, Australia, New Zealand) for the first time, adding new teams in Argentina and Japan.|$|E
25|$|New Brunswick {{was one of}} {{the four}} {{original}} provinces of Canada that entered into Confederation in 1867.

This interest arose from the Province of Canada (formerly Upper and Lower Canada, later Ontario and Quebec) and a request was made by the Canadians to the Maritimers to have the meeting's agenda altered.|$|E

40|$|Globally, {{coastal and}} marine {{ecosystems}} are undergoing rapid changes, degradation, {{and loss of}} biodiversity and ecosystem function. Degradation and loss of these vital ecosystems seriously jeopardize {{the social and economic}} well-being, food security and development poten-tial of billions of people. Some of the major human-induced threats con-tributing to this crisis are habitat loss, overexploitation and destructive fishing practices, poor land use practices and land-based sources of pol-lution, invasive species and climate change (Burke et al., 2002). In response to the pressures facing coastal and marine ecosystems, two major approaches (or fields) have emerged over the last several decades—integrated coastal management (ICM) and, more recently, marine biodiversity conservation. While both fields may share the same ultimate end goal—that of healthy, sustained ecosystems—and utilize similar tools, the fields do have differing priorities, focuses, and often <b>geographic</b> <b>scopes</b> that distinguish them...|$|R

40|$|The {{increased}} {{availability of}} global communication infrastructures allows providers and users of various application services {{to cooperate in}} nearly unlimited <b>geographic</b> <b>scopes.</b> Problems of heterogeneity and scale have motivated specific standardisation activities for client/server "trading " or service "mediation " components. Motivated by current limitations of the emerging ODP (Open Distributed Processing) trader, this paper argues for a broader concept of general service "mediation " as more appropriate for realistic open distributed environments. The proposed mediation concept addresses some of the heterogeneity and flexibility requirements of open service co-operation by a uniform "Service Interface Description Language " (SIDL). The goal is to support distributed application development for a "Common Open Service Market " (COSM) by facilitating flexible service selection and client/server interaction. The paper also presents basic components of a generalised trading and mediation architecture {{as well as the}} status of a prototype implementation. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we compare}} {{different}} methods for the automatic assignment of <b>geographic</b> <b>scopes</b> to Web pages, based on placenames {{mentioned in the}} text. The methods under study are the Yahoo! Placemaker Web service, the hierarchy-based method originally proposed for the Web-a-Where system, the spatial overlap-based method originally proposed in the GIPSY project, the graph-based method originally proposed in the GREASE project, and three simple baseline methods corresponding to using the most frequently occurring place, the spatial area that covers all mentioned places, or the spatial area that covers all mentioned non-outlier places. The task under study may be included into the broader problem of Geographic Information Retrieval. Experiments were carried out on Web pages from the Regional Section of the Open Directory Project, comparing the automatically assigned scopes against those assigned by human editors. The {{results show that the}} Web-a-Where method gives the best results, closely followed by the GraphRank metho...|$|R

2500|$|John Williams {{composed}} {{and conducted}} the film's musical score, the second score composed {{the same year}} by Williams for Spielberg after The Adventures of Tintin. [...] Williams took inspiration by visiting a horse farm in California and observing horses and their behavior, elaborating that [...] "I got {{in the habit of}} watching the horses in the morning, and I began to see how they connect to each other and how they became curious about me. That's when I really began to get the sense that horses are very special creatures. They have been magnificent and trusted friends {{for such a long time}} and have done so much for us with such grace." [...] Williams was also influenced by the <b>geographic</b> <b>scope</b> of the film's story. In regards to that approach, Williams stated; [...] "This was a very rich opportunity musically because it is both about humans and animals and it takes place in three different countries. It starts out in a more intimate way, on the farm with the bonding of Joey and Albert. Then, the eruption of war changes the scale, and the music does a 180-degree turn. From this bucolic, gentle, even sentimental music, you move into the music of battle surges and gripping struggles. It's a musical journey full of dimension and emotional content, and I tried also to create an atmosphere reflective of that period, which was lyrical, poetic and tragic." [...] The score was recorded by a 90-piece orchestra, with Williams comparing the recording sessions more to a concert piece rather than a traditional film score, as it relied more on the individual performance of the musicians.|$|E
30|$|The link-local {{multicast}} capability emulation {{is achieved}} by relying on the geo-multicast/geo-broadcast capabilities provided by the ETSI GN layer. In particular, {{in order to be}} link-local multicast capable, an IP link must provide symmetric reachability [3], which is normally not accomplished by virtual links spanning multiple physical links {{due to the lack of}} reference boundaries. Link-local multicast packets are forwarded with geographical knowledge, so that a node processes a packet only if it was addressed to the area where the node is located. The <b>geographic</b> <b>scoping</b> provides non-variable virtual link boundaries which enable symmetric reachability. For RAs, this means that RAs must be delivered to--and only to--the nodes that are part of the same IPv 6 link, nodes that are actually connected via multiple wireless hops. If a multi-hop path exists, all the nodes within the area will receive a copy of the RA, and the IPv 6 instance running above the geonetworking will process the message as if the node was directly connected to the access router that issued the message.|$|R

Many public {{organizations}} {{are working on}} the construction of spatial data infrastructures (SDI) that will enable them to share their geographic information. However, not only geographic data are managed in these SDIs, and, in general, in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), but also many textual documents must be stored and retrieved (such as urban planning permissions and administrative files). Textual index structures must be integrated with GIS in order to provide an efficient access to these documents. Furthermore, many of these documents include geographic references within their texts. Therefore, queries with <b>geographic</b> <b>scopes</b> should be correctly answered by the index structure and the special characteristics of these geographic references, due to their spatial nature, should be taken into account. We present in this paper a workflow process that allows a gradual and collaborative creation of a document repository. These documents can be efficiently retrieved using queries regarding their texts and regarding the geographic references included within them. Moreover, the index structure and the supported query types are briefly described...|$|R

Besides quantifying the conditions under which the di#erent routing algorithms outperform each other, we obtain a number of useful design insights. Our analysis shows that algorithms mismatched to applications can result in drastically poor performance; demonstrates the desirability of reducing flooded interest and exploratory messages when data aggregation is used; and suggests that it may be di#cult to implement e#cient hybrid schemes because their performance is very sensitive to the optimal placement of rendezvous points...|$|R
