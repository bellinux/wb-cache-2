5|$|By {{the end of}} 1927, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) had {{designated}} a highway numbered M-7 between Three Rivers and Centreville. This highway was extended east {{by the middle of}} 1936. The route connected US131 in downtown Three Rivers to US112 outside Coldwater. At the time of the extension, all of M-7 was a gravel road. Later that year, the original segment between Three Rivers and Colon was paved, and the state extended the <b>hard-surface</b> route as far as Nottawa in 1937.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was first}} {{designated}} along {{a series of}} roads between Appleton and Minneapolis around 1933. At first these roads were a mixture of gravel and bitumen surfaces, the latter a forerunner of today's asphalt. Within the first year or so, the western end was extended to terminate MN7 in the Ortonville area. In 1958, the highway was extended to its modern western terminus at Beardsley by replacing another trunk highway. The section that is now an expressway in the Twin Cities was expanded by the 1950s, and the whole highway was paved in a <b>hard-surface</b> {{by the end of}} that decade. The highway was truncated in the Twin Cities to its current eastern terminus in the 1980s. The scenic byways designations were applied at the state and federal levels in 1995 and 2002, respectively.|$|E
25|$|When the {{airfield}} {{was turned over}} for American use, Steeple Morden was assigned USAAF designation Station 122. <b>Hard-surface</b> runways were laid down, along with concrete hardstands and a permanent T-2 hangar.|$|E

25|$|The {{site was}} named Camp Williams in 1927 {{in honor of}} Lieutenant Colonel Charles R. Williams, the chief {{quartermaster}} of the post from 1917 {{until his death in}} 1926. Camp Williams grew slowly following the First World War, but with the development of the airplane, the first <b>hard-surface</b> runways were constructed in 1935 and 1936.|$|E
25|$|Soon, the Mule Train route {{structure}} became {{linked to the}} <b>hard-surface</b> runways at Da Nang, Tan Son Nhut, Nha Trang, Bien Hoa, Pleiku, Ban Me Thuot, Huế, Da Lat, Sóc Trăng, Qui Nhơn, and Vũng Tàu. Virtually every Mule Train sortie began or ended {{at one of these}} airfields, but intermediate stops could be anywhere.|$|E
500|$|Bunker {{arrived in}} Riyadh on March 6. Faisal refused Bunker's offer, {{which was also}} hitched to pledges of reform. The {{original}} instructions for Operation <b>Hard-surface</b> were that American planes would [...] "attack and destroy" [...] any intruders over Saudi air space, but were later changed to read that the Saudis could defend themselves if attacked. Bunker evidently stuck to the original formula and stressed that if only Faisal would halt his aid to the royalists, the US would be able pressure Nasser to withdraw. Faisal eventually accepted the offer, and Bunker went on to meet with Nasser in Beirut, where the Egyptian President repeated the assurance he had given Bunche.|$|E

500|$|The 1930s and 1940s brought {{much change}} to the Island City. KLUF radio began {{broadcasting}} in 1937. During the World War II, the Galveston Municipal Airport, predecessor to Scholes International Airport, was redesignated a U.S. Army Air Corps base and named [...] "Galveston Army Air Field". The United States Army Corps of Engineers, using funds made available by Congress through the Civil Aeronautics Authority, constructed three [...] long, <b>hard-surface</b> runways at the airport to accommodate army aircraft. In January 1943, Galveston Army Air Field was officially activated with the 46th Bombardment Group serving an anti-submarine role in the Gulf of Mexico. Later it {{was replaced by the}} 10th anti-submarine squadron, flying RM-37 Lockheed Venturas.|$|E
500|$|The {{construction}} of M-123 {{started in the}} 1930s near Eckerman, {{the location of the}} current eastern M-28/M-123 junction. By 1936, M-123 was designated running north of M-28 on [...] of <b>hard-surface</b> pavement. At this time, US2 is routed along Worth Road and uses roadway later used by M-123 from Moran to Rogers Park, and M-48 was routed north of Newberry to Four Mile Corner. The first extension of M-123 southward from Eckerman, through Trout Lake to Rogers Park north of St. Ignace, came in 1954. Part of this routing in Trout Lake uses M-48 (now a portion of H-40). An additional extension is shown north to the Tahquamenon River Bridge, lengthening the highway to the north on the April 15, 1954 official state map. The section north to the Tahquamenon River Bridge is remarked on the October 1, 1954 state map as a county road, however. In 1957, M-123 was permanently extended north to the bridge, and in 1962 the final extension north to Paradise and south to Newberry was completed. From Four Mile Corner south, M-123 replaced M-117 to a new terminus at M-28 south of Newberry. The southernmost section of roadway between the I-75/US2 freeway and H-63 (Old US2) was transferred to Mackinac County for maintenance {{with the opening of the}} freeway in 1963.|$|E

2500|$|The new runway {{reduces the}} need for the {{existing}} Runway 15L/33R, which, at only [...] is among the shortest <b>hard-surface</b> runways at major airports in the United States. In 1988, Massport had proposed an [...] extension to this airstrip (a project which would have required additional filling-in of land along a clam bed), but was thwarted by a court injunction.|$|E

2500|$|Joppa Road between US 1 and MD 147 was {{constructed}} by {{the state as a}} concrete road in 1925 and 1926. That road, which became MD 148, was the final link in the state and county construction of a <b>hard-surface</b> circumferential highway from Eastern Avenue (MD 150) to Liberty Road (MD 26). Between 1930 and 1933, Joppa Road was widened, resurfaced as a concrete road, and brought into the state highway system from MD 147 west to US 111. In 1934, the portion of MD 148 between MD 147 and US 1 was proposed to be widened from [...] MD 148 was widened with a pair of [...] macadam shoulders from US 1 to MD 147 in 1938 and from there to MD 542 in 1940. The highway was widened to [...] and resurfaced from MD 542 to Providence Road in 1948. Between 1950 and 1952, the block of MD 148 immediately to the east of US 111 was shifted, widened, and reconstructed as a bridge over the ground floor of the first suburban location of the Hutzler's department store.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1945 the Soviets began {{a series}} of offensives in its drive to Berlin. The Lower Silesian Offensive and Upper Silesian Offensives and the vital Vistula-Oder Offensive was {{designed}} to bring the Red Army to the eastern border of Germany. The Soviets began their offensive early, to take the pressure off the Western Allies in the Ardennes. For the Fw 190s units, the initial stages were to prove tactically successful. The Soviets were forced to start offensive action under severe weather conditions. Airfields were reduced to mud-baths owing to heavy rains, and open country became impassable owing after use by large numbers of vehicles. The Red Air Force suffered more losses to accidents than combat. The Soviet armour was forced to use the few <b>hard-surface</b> roads to continue their advance. These routes were easily detected by German Schlachtgeschwader. The Germans, by contrast, had hard surface runways in German territory and large hangars for aircraft. On 26 January 800 vehicles, 14 tanks and 40 artillery pieces were claimed among the crammed highways. After two weeks, the offensive slowed. Fw 190 units in particular exacted a heavy toll of Soviet infantry; attacking in waves of seven to nine, unchallenged. Overall, the Germans claimed 2,000 vehicles and 51 tanks in the first three days of February. However, this came at a cost of 107 aircraft in nearly 3,000 attacks. The largest concentration of German air forces since 1940 was amassed against the Soviets, which saw the Germans gain air supremacy briefly, contributing to saving Berlin from capture sooner. The rapid construction of concrete runways allowed the Soviets to win back [...] "aerial superiority". On 14 or 16 February 1945 [...] Otto Kittel became the most successful Luftwaffe ace to be killed in action; Kittel had achieved 267 victories on the Eastern Front, all but 39 in the Fw 190.|$|E
