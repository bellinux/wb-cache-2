25|$|Many {{cyanides}} {{are highly}} toxic. The cyanide anion is an inhibitor of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (also known as aa3) {{in the fourth}} complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It attaches to the iron within this protein. The binding of cyanide to this enzyme prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted, meaning that the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that depend highly on aerobic respiration, such as {{the central nervous system}} and the heart, are particularly affected. This is an example of <b>histotoxic</b> <b>hypoxia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Histotoxic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> {{can be a}} {{consequence}} of ischemia {{in the case of}} stroke or inflammation. In the case of inflammation, neuro-inflammatory deseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis can all lead to <b>histotoxic</b> <b>hypoxia.</b> During a stroke, there is an interruption in the blood supply followed by reperfusion which leads to <b>histotoxic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> because of an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). [...] In the case of inflammatory diseases, <b>histotoxic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> can also be triggered by ROS from mitochondrial damage in the active lesions of chronic multiple sclerosis.

40|$|DISTRIBUTION: Annuals, ephemeral growth (“opslag”) or perennials. Often {{cultivated}} in gardens. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION: Typical daisy flower, ray florets on the outside. Often scalloped leaf. Sticky, sometimes aromatic. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: • Cyanogenic glycosides • LD HCN + 2 mg/kg in all species • Monogastric animals less affected by plants with cyanogenic glycosides because HCl destroys hydrolysing enzymes • Plants {{with more than}} 20 mg % (200 ppm) HCN, potentially dangerous. ABSORPTION AND DISPOSITION: • CN¯ rapidly absorbed from g. i. t. and by inhalation (HCN gas) • Rapidly and very effectively detoxified in body by sulphur transferase (rhodanese) enzymes which bind it to sulphur from sulphane pool forming thiocyanate (which is excreted through urine). • Possible to ingest just less than LD continuously over extended periods without harm. • If rate of liberation from glycosides in plants exceeds speed of detoxification, problems occur. MECHANISM OF ACTION: • In excess situation CN¯ binds stably with Fe³+ in tissue cytochrome oxidase system and inhibits this. Thus electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation is stopped and chain of cellular respiration is halted. • Results in <b>histotoxic</b> anoxia or <b>hypoxia.</b> • Normal oxygenation of blood not interfered with. • Blood stays red. (When treating, jugular blood much redder than normal.) • CNS depression sets in (oxygen requirement of CNS high) • Terminally respiratory depression sets in and available oxygen is utilised by uninhibited cytochrome oxidase leading to cyanosis. SYNDROMES: Prussic acid poisoning, geilsiekte. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Haemopoietic system. CLINICAL SIGNS: In practice a problem in cattle, sheep and goats. Peracute: • Death in few minutes - usually found dead. • Transient convulsions progressing to paralysis, stupor. Acute: (usually) • Respiratory distress - dyspnoea (gasping), polypnoea, cyanosis. • CNS excitement and tremor - convulsions, paralysis and stupor. • G. I. T. : Bloat, frothing at mouth and salivation may occur. NECROPSY: • Cyanosis - (in peracute poisoning e. g. execution in man, may have bright red blood). • Congestion of blood vessels (blood unclotted or clots slowly). • Asphyxiation signs: haemorrhages in trachea, bronchi and lungs. • Subepi- and -endocardial haemorrhages frequent. • Smell of bitter almonds (only some individuals can smell it) • Rumen: Leaves and other plant residues. DIAGNOSIS: • HCN rapidly degraded and dissipates easily. • Specimens to be taken soon after death. • Degradation rapid in liver and rumen. • Much slower in muscle, although HCN concentration in muscle is much lower.

Keep specimen refrigerated or frozen: • Ruminal content • Liver • Muscle • Plant material. TREATMENT: Two steps: 1. Remove the cyanide from the cytochrome oxidase and fix this lethal CN¯ in harmless, inert form. CN has greater affinity for tissue cytochrome oxidase Fe 3 + than methaemoglobin, but can be removed from cytochrome system by large methaemoglobin concentrations. Therefore increase methaemoglobin concentration carefully and under controlled conditions with NaNO 2 solution intravenously. 2. Then assist in removal of CN¯ via urine as thiocyanate. Assist sulphur transferases to inactivate cyanide by supplying sulphur in form of sodium thiosulphate (“hypo”). PREVENTION AND AVOIDANCE: Supply extra sulphur • 5 - 7 % flowers of sulphur in lick • Hypo in drinking water Avoid or limit grazing of plants during danger periods - avoid wilted, frosted and hail-damaged material.

50|$|Cyanide {{poisoning}} {{is a form}} of <b>histotoxic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> {{because the}} cells of an organism are unable to create ATP, primarily through the inhibition of the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. Cyanide is quickly metabolized to ATCA (an intermediate) and thiocyanate (SCN) with a half life of 10-30 minutes as a detoxifying mechanism. Within a few hours of single ingestion, no cyanide can be detected, since all of it is metabolized unless death occurs first. (The detection of cyanide long after supposed ingestion is an indication of a false positive in the diagnostics.) Thiocyanate has a long half life of >24hrs, and is typically eliminated through the kidneys. Thiocyanate is ~1/100th the toxicity of the cyanide parent molecule.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} <b>histotoxic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> is cyanide poisoning. There is a {{profound}} drop in tissue oxygen consumption since the reaction of oxygen with cytochrome oxidase is blocked {{by the presence of}} cyanide. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion on cytochrome oxidase a3 and prevents the fourth and final reaction in the electron transport chain. This completely stops oxidative phosphorylation and prevents the mitochondria from producing ATP. There are other chemicals that interrupt the mitochondrial electron transport chain (e.g., rotenone, antimycin A) and produce effects on tissue oxygenation similar to that of cyanide. Oxygen extraction decreases in parallel with the lower oxygen consumption, with a resulting increase in venous oxygen content and PvO2. Although cyanide stimulates the peripheral respiratory chemoreceptors, increasing the inspired oxygen fraction is not helpful, since there is already an adequate amount of oxygen which the poisoned cells cannot use.|$|E

The present {{study was designed to}} investigate whether MIC could induce <b>histotoxic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> through its effects on mitochondrial respiration. Male Wistar rats were used for liver mitochondrial and submitochondrial particle (SMP) preparation. Addition of MIC to tightly coupled mitochondria in vitro resulted in stimulation of state 4 respiration, abolition of respiratory control, decrease in ADP/O ratio, and inhibition of state 3 oxidation. The oxidation of NAD+-linked substrates (glutamate + malate) was more sensitive (fiveto sixfold) to the inhibitory action of MIC than succinate while cytochrome oxidase remained unaffected. MIC induced twofold delay in the onset of anerobiosis, and cytochrome b reduction in SMP with NADH in vitro confirms inhibition of electron transport at complex I region. MIC also stimulated the ATPase activity in tightly coupled mitochondria while lipid peroxidation remained unaffected. As its hydrolysis products, methylamine and N,N?-dimethylurea failed to elicit any change in vitro; these effects reveal that MIC per se acts as an inhibitor of electron transport and a weak uncoupler. Administration of MIC sc at lethal dose caused a similar change only with NAD+-linked substrates, reflecting impairment of mitochondrial respiration at complex I region and thereby induction of <b>histotoxic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> in vivo...|$|E

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the brain to cyanide-induced <b>histotoxic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> and the protective effects of known cyanide antagonists, have been assessed in vivo by reflectance spectrophotometry. Cyanide-related changes in cytochrome a,a 3 (cytochrome c oxidase) oxidation-reduction (redox) state, tissue hemoglobin saturation, and local blood volume were continuously monitored in cerebral cortex of rats. Noncumulative, dose-dependent inhibition of the in situ mitochondrial respiratory chain was evaluated directly by measuring increases in reduction levels of the terminal oxidase. These transient cytochrome a,a 3 reductions were accompanied by increases in regional cerebral hemoglobin saturation and blood volume. Cytochrome redox responses were not altered either in magnitude or kinetics by hyperoxia; however, the cyanide-cytochrome dose-response curve was greatly shifted to the right by pretreatment with sodium nitrite, and the recovery rate of cytochrome a,a 3 from cyanide-induced reduction was enhanced fourfold by pretreatment with sodium thiosulfate...|$|E
40|$|Artificially induced {{hypometabolism}} in nonhibernating mammals {{may have}} considerable clinical implications. Numerous studies in small rodent models {{have demonstrated that}} hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) induces hypometabolism, supposedly {{as a result of}} <b>histotoxic</b> <b>hypoxia.</b> However, the induction of hypometabolism is absent in large animals following H 2 S administration. To determine the cause of this animal size-dependent discrepancy in H 2 S pharmacodynamics, the effects of sodium H 2 S (NaSH; 5 mg/kg/h, 4 -hour intravenous administration) on systemic, pneumocardial, hematological, biochemical, microvascular (sublingual), and histological parameters were investigated in pigs. After 4 h, no differences were observed between the NaSH and control group with respect to systemic, pneumocardial, hematological, biochemical, and histological parameters. However, NaSH triggered significant hyperperfusion in the sublingual microcirculation, as evidenced by an increased blood vessel diameter (154 +/- 16 and 85 +/- 25 % vs. baseline for NaSH and NaCl, respectively), total vessel density (139 +/- 18 and 98 +/- 13 %, respectively), and perfused vessel density (139 +/- 18 and 99 +/- 13 %, respectively). These phenomena are consistent with microvascular changes that occur during a panting response, an important heat loss mechanism (i. e., thermoregulatory effector) in pigs that is controlled by the thermoneutral zone (Z(tn)). On the basis of our findings and the literature, a mechanistic explanation is provided for the differential manifestation of hypometabolism between small and large animals. In large animals, H 2 S does not act via <b>histotoxic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> but likely triggers carotid bodies to transmit a hypoxic signal, which subsequently lowers the Z(tn) and activates heat loss mechanisms (e. g., panting) to align ATP consumption with ATP production through hypothermia. Since large animals have a small surface: size ratio, the cooling rate is too inefficient to accommodate hypothermia and subsequent hypometabolism. This is why large animals do not exhibit hypometabolism, despite the activation of thermoregulatory effectors. This is also a reason for the poor translatability of artificial hypometabolism to the clinical setting. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Farmers ' {{formic acid}} {{exposure}} was studied by field measurements in the silage-making season at 14 Finnish farms. Two preservative solutions were used which differed in concentration of formic acid. Time-weighted average {{exposure to the}} acid vapour varied with the tasks {{carried out in the}} open air from 0 to 30 mgrn' 1, while vertical silo filling caused an exposure of from 0 to 7. 0 mg rrT 3. Comparable figures were found for the horizontal silos, while adding the formic acid on the surface of forage in the silo caused exposures ranging from 33 to 99 mg m" 3. These latter concentrations were considered to constitute a significant health hazard especially in fanners with cardiovascular diseases; formic acid is an inhibitor of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase thereby inducing <b>histotoxic</b> <b>hypoxia.</b> Goggles and respirators should be used in the silos to prevent acid spills and inhalation of acid vapour...|$|E
40|$|The {{cause of}} the initial hyperventilation, which occurs on {{exposure}} to O 2 at high pressure (o. h. p.), has been investigated by measuring tidal volume (VT), frequency of breathing (f) and hence ventilation (VE) in thirty-six barbiturate-anaesthetized rats, with or without their glossopharyngeal (IX) nerves sectioned, during 30 - 60 min of exposure to o. h. p. at 4, 6 or 8 atm absolute. In intact rats the rates of rise of VT, f and VE with time during exposure to o. h. p. were smallest at 4 and greatest at 8 atm absolute. In IX-sectioned rats the rates of rise of VT at 4, 6 and 8 atm absolute and of f at 4 atm absolute {{were similar to those}} of intact rats. At 6 atm absolute and even more so at 8 atm absolute, however, f decreased. Hence the slope of VE in IX-sectioned compared with intact rats was similar at 4 atm absolute but smaller at 6 and 8 atm absolute. In fact at 8 atm absolute VE remained constant in IX-sectioned rats. Since the slope of VE versus time in intact rats was steeper the greater the pressure and since the removal of carotid bodies in IX-sectioned rats reduced the VE slope at 6 and 8 atm absolute, the stimulus to the hyperventilation induced by o. h. p. cannot be an accumulation of CO 2 in the brain resulting from the lack of O 2 desaturation of haemoglobin. This theory would predict that VE should be identical at all pressures above 3. 5 atm absolute. The findings in the IX-sectioned rats indicate a major contribution of the carotid bodies to the f increase in o. h. p. They may be stimulated by a <b>histotoxic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> induced by early O 2 poisoning. Since the VT increase on exposure to o. h. p. was both large and fairly similar in intact and IX-sectioned rats, it is suggested that {{a large part of the}} VT increase was caused by stimulation of the central chemoreceptors by lactic acidosis induced by an o. h. p. -induced <b>histotoxic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> of the brain...|$|E

In all instances, the crabs developed hemolymph acidosis, but no respiratory (increased PCO 2) or lactate increases were evident. Hemolymph levels of sodium and calcium were always increased by cadmium exposure. The chronic toxicity of cadmium was enhanced at 12 &# 137; salinity, even causing a significantly higher mortality {{in comparison with the}} higher salinity (30 &# 137;) used. A general metabolic arrest took place at 12 &# 137; salinity in the crabs chronically exposed to cadmium, as indicated by decreases of {{oxygen consumption}} and PCO 2, an increase of PO 2, along with no changes in lactate levels. These imbalances were associated with severe necrosis and telangiectasia in the respiratory gills, probably leading to respiratory impairment and finally <b>histotoxic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> and death of the animals...|$|E

Numerous cases of sudden deaths caused by intentional propane and/or butane inhalation have been described, but these cases survived and {{a description of the}} consequences is very rare. We describe a prisoner who survived after voluntary inhalation of LPG, and who developed ataxia, Parkinsonism, and dystonia. Brain MRI showed bilateral hyperintensity in the basal ganglia and in the cerebellar hemispheres. The clinical evolution and the MRI abnormalities are similar to those described in cases of poisoning by CO where the mechanism of brain injury is related to <b>histotoxic</b> <b>hypoxia.</b> We believe that LPG, considered until now a mixture of gas with low neurotoxic power, may have caused direct toxic damage to the brain, mediated by a mechanism of hypoxia, such as in CO intoxication.

Physiol. 37 (1) : 18 - 2 1. 1974. -The effect of central <b>histotoxic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> on blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration was studied in exteriorized term fetal lambs under general anesthesia. NaCN (0. 2 - 3 mg) was injected {{onto the floor}} of the fourth ventricle and into the subarachnoid space of the ventral medulla in intact and sinoaortic denervated fetuses. Sub-medullary infusions of cyanide evoked a significant (P < 0. 001) elevation in blood pressure in intact and denervated fetuses. Heart rate was increased significantly above preinjection levels only in the denervated fetuses. Respiratory efforts were induced in all fetuses tested, and this response was independent of arterial pH or blood gas tensions. The response varied from 1 to 4 gasps in the intact fetus and from a single gasp to rhythmic ventilation following sino-aortic denervation. The mean delay time to respond was 21. 9 =f= 4. 3 and 41. 9 zt 7. 0 s in the intact and denervated fetuses, respec...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTwo main periods can be {{considered}} in the history of fish metabolism under pressure. The first period (roughly from 1870 to 1970) was mainly descriptive: survival times and behavior were studied and some authors described an increase in oxygen consumption under pressure; later, the counteracting effects of high temperature on pressure were mentioned. The second period (from 1970 onwards) was more integrative and two major ways were explored. The first was to use shallow-water fish, experimentally exposed to hydrostatic pressure, which can induce a metabolic state resembling <b>histotoxic</b> <b>hypoxia.</b> The second way was to use deep-living fish which have, when compared to surface fish, muscle enzymes with higher structural stability, lower activity (in relationship with habitat depth) and kinetics that are less sensitive to pressure increase. Using this approach, it was also shown that muscle composition and function were somewhat different at depth and that deep fish are well adapted to pressure partly by maintaining membrane fluidity (homeoviscous theory). Since about 1990, the two above-mentioned approaches have still been pursued but by fewer researchers. Studies on deep-living fish are mainly concerned with enzyme kinetics whereas shallow water fish are used mainly for cellular energetic studies. Regarding this topic, {{it has been shown that}} yellow freshwater eels are able to acclimate to high-pressure effects, by optimizing membrane fluidity and composition (as achieved by deep-living fish), by improving oxidative phosphorylation (increase of P/O ratio) and the glycolytic pathway...|$|E
