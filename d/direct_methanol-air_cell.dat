40|$|A <b>direct</b> <b>methanol-air</b> <b>cell</b> {{operating}} at near atmospheric pressure, low-flow rate air, and at temperatures close to 60 C would tremendously enlarge {{the scope of}} potential applications. While earlier studies have reported performance with oxygen, the present study focuses on characterizing {{the performance of a}} PEM liquid feed <b>direct</b> <b>methanol-air</b> <b>cell</b> consisting of components developed in house. These cells employ catalyst in the anode, Pt at the cathode and 117 as the PEM. The effect of pressure, flow rate of air and temperature on performance has been studied. With air, the performance level is as high as 0, 437 V at 300 (90 oC, 20 and excess air flow) has been attained. Even more significant is the performance at 1 at and low flow rates of air (3 - 5 times which is 0. 4 V at 150. Individual electrode potentials for the methanol and air electrode have been separated and analyzed. Fuel crossover rates and the impact of fuel crossover on the performance of the air electrode have also [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A high {{surface area}} {{platinum}} catalyst has been {{prepared by the}} electrochemical processing of uranium platinum car-bide. This Raney-type catalyst has a roughness factor exceeding 3000. The methanol oxidation current at this catalyst was about 1. 8 A/cm 2 at 60 ~ and a polarization of 1. 2 V. Due to the high activity of the catalyst, the inhibition ofmethanol oxi-dation at more positive potentials and the consequent hysteresis n the oxidation response were not observed. The prepa-ration, characterization, and evaluation of this catalyst material are described. The <b>direct</b> <b>methanol-air</b> fuel <b>cell</b> is an extremely promis-ing power source for automotive applications. The fuel cell must operate in an acid environment since the oxidation product, CO 2, {{will lead to the}} precipitation ofcarbonates in alkaline lectrolytes (1). This precipitation will result in the plugging of electrode pores, a decrease in the conductivity of the electrolyte, and an increase in concentration polar-ization losses (2). Thus, acid electrolytes or solid polymer electrolytes, uch as the poly(perfluorosulfonic acid) mem...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{synthesis}} and {{the properties of}} microporous, ceramic-added, composite poly(vinylidene) fluoride (PVdF) -based proton conducting membranes for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). The favorable characteristics of these membranes are an high and stable conductivity, a proton transport mechanism not critically related to the water content, the low cost, and the low methanol crossover. Tests in a <b>methanol-air</b> laboratory <b>cell</b> demonstrate the applicability of these membranes in DMFCs. (C) 2003 The Electrochemical Society...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{synthesis}} and the properties of a new microporous, composite proton-conducting gel membrane, formed by swelling a poly(vinylidene) fluoride-poly(acrylonitrile), PVdF-PAN blend-based matrix containing a dispersed Al 2 O 3 ceramic filler with aqueous acid solutions. We show that this membrane has a high and stable conductivity, a proton transport not critically influenced by the relative humidity level, and a projected low cost. Tests in a <b>methanol-air</b> laboratory <b>cell</b> also demonstrate that the membrane is basically suitable for application in direct methanol fuel cells...|$|R
40|$|Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs) use {{membranes}} (PEMs) {{which are}} acidic in nature. The air electrode polarization is high [1]. Therefore {{we looked at}} the alkaline <b>Methanol-Air</b> <b>Cells</b> and discovered that they could actually replace Metal-Air cells. The use of Zinc-Air and Zinc-Aluminum cells with exchangeable electrolyte and replaceable metallic anodes has been suggested for many purposes, ranging from military power sources to electronic equipment to electric vehicles. In recent versions, Zn-metal pellets and dry KOH powder mixes were inserted and only water had to be added. All these procedures are mechanical in nature and not too efficient if the energy needed for the regeneration is considered. In 1994 a large project using Zn and ZnO in replaceable cassettes was supported by the German postal service. It was finally abandoned. The mechanical features are avoided by using methanol as fuel in a caustic liquid electrolyte. The methanol in the KOH is kept at a low level by sensing it and injecting it when needed. Finally, the nearly used up, highly carbonated electrolyte is exchanged. This is not new [2] and high current densities have been reported [3], with only one major trouble: the cross-leakage [4] of the methanol to the air cathode damages the noble metal catalysts. Now, ver...|$|R
