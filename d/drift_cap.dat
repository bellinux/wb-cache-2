"Winter {{is upon us}} fairly now, friends," [...] said Captain Vane as he {{surveyed}} the prospect from the Pole, which was itself all but buried in the universal <b>drift,</b> and <b>capped</b> with the hugest wedding-cake of all; [...] "we shall have to accommodate ourselves to circumstances, and prepare for the campaign." ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Drifting</b> polar <b>cap</b> patches are {{localized}} {{regions of}} enhanced F-region plasma densities with scale sizes of several hundreds of kilometre. The patches {{are seen to}} drift antisunward with velocities of several hundreds meters per second, and can have densities up to 10 times the ambient background. We present simultaneous ground based optical and radar data of nightside polar cap patches. Using meridian scanning photometer data, the optical airglow signature of patches are seen to drift into the auroral oval. The field aligned radar shows high electron density, with low electron temperature {{during the period of}} interest. This indicates that there is no electron precipitation in the radar field of view, and that the radar electron density signal stems from the <b>drifting</b> polar <b>cap</b> patches. It is seen that there is a very good match between enhancements in the 6300 Å airglow signature and enhancements in the radar electron density measurements...|$|R
60|$|The {{squadron}} <b>drifted</b> up beyond <b>Cap</b> Rouge, and anchored, {{at the top}} of the flood, an {{hour before}} daybreak. The gig was lowered, and James Walsham, amid many good wishes and hearty farewells from the officers, took his place in her, by the side of the midshipman.|$|R
40|$|The Taoudéni Basin covers over 1 000 000 km 2 of the West African Craton, {{bounded by}} Pan-African orogenic belts. Four supergroups {{separated}} by craton-scale unconformities are recognized, with Neoproterozoic glaciogenic deposits occurring {{at the base}} of Supergroup 2. The Jbéliat Group occurs along a continuous, 1300 -km-long, narrow belt from the Adrar region of Mauritania to the eastern limit of the Hank in Algeria and comprises thin glacial <b>drift</b> <b>capped</b> widely by periglacial polygonal structures, with more complex glacial sequences preserved in palaeo-depressions. A thicker, variously marine and continental glaciogenic succession can be found in southern parts, while fully marine, glacially influenced successions are only known from the extreme SW of the basin. The 'triad' sequence of diamictites overlain by barite-bearing 'cap' dolostones and then by green shales and/or bedded cherts (silexites) is ubiquitous and has long been used to correlate the Supergroup 1 / 2 boundary across the basin and into the surrounding orogenic belts. The bedded cherts commonly show a volcanic influence and are cemented by early marine calcite at their base at Adrar, Mauritania. Although fossil-based age constraints are scarce and ambiguous, regional tectonic events indicate that 'triad' deposition occurred between the Bassaride (665 – 655 Ma) and Dahomeyide (610 – 580 Ma) orogens. Recent U–Pb zircon studies of ignimbrite tuffs provide a minimum age for the glaciation of c. 600 Ma. Correlation of supergroup 2 glacial deposits with the c. 635 Ma end-Cryogenian ('Marinoan') glaciation is likely and is supported by limited carbon and strontium isotope data. Barite is commonly found within the cap carbonate and may relate to methane seepage and/or unusual oceanographic conditions after deglaciation. Several studies have attributed sequence complexity within the post-glacial succession to isostatic reequilibration. The Taoudéni Basin represents a rare Neoproterozoic example of terrestrial tillites and associated periglacial facies...|$|R
5000|$|... ==Sugarloaf Mountain1== This popular {{climbing}} destination rises 690 ft {{above the}} fertile valley {{just east of}} the city of Heber Springs. It formed as an erosional remnant by the Little Red River (Arkansas). It stands as a monument to the eons of time when the river was patiently carving out the valley from the surrounding hills. Why the sandstone formation has held firm on top of the long familiar landmark is a question that geologists can explain. Because the huge rocks {{at the top of the}} formation lie in flat layers and were not folded by continental <b>drift,</b> they <b>cap</b> the mountain on which they lie. Through the centuries, less resistant units of sandstone, silt stone and shale eroded away, leaving the atoka formation which the white man called Sugar Loaf.|$|R
40|$|The end cap {{detector}} {{based on}} multimodule construction {{has been designed}} and produced for the L 3 experiment. The {{purpose of this article}} is to present a fruitful approach for solving the complex problem of selecting a set of strongly interrelated design parameters to satisfy performance criteria in the face of severe environmental and space constraints. The design principle of the end <b>cap</b> <b>drift</b> chamber affected by a complex of external problems caused by the layout is reviewed. It is shown that in the framework of detailed consideration of each parameter, a good spacetime linearity, spatial and angular resolution is obtainable. The results of experimental tests are presented. (10 refs) ...|$|R
40|$|Motion from {{multiple}} chemical releases between 200 and 300 km from 15 rockets launched from 4 high latitude locations are analyzed. The observations {{in the evening}} and midnight hours at magnetic altitudes or = 65 deg suggest that in these regions ion drag is the dominant force in driving neutral winds between 200 and 300 km. This conclusion is based on both the agreement between ion and neutral drift directions, and {{the fact that there are}} distinct changes in the wind associated with (a) the reversal in east-west ion drift at the Harang discontinuity, and (b) the transition from auroral belt, sunward ion <b>drift</b> and polar <b>cap,</b> anti-solar ion <b>drift...</b>|$|R
50|$|Crustal {{movements}} (such as continental <b>drift)</b> or polar <b>cap</b> melting {{are slow}} secular events. The characteristic coupling time between core and mantle {{has been estimated}} {{to be on the}} order of ten years, and the so-called 'decade fluctuations' of Earth's rotation rate are thought to result from fluctuations within the core, transferred to the mantle. The length of day (LOD) varies significantly even for time scales from a few years down to weeks (Figure), and the observed fluctuations in the LOD - after eliminating the effects of external torques - are a direct consequence of the action of internal torques. These short term fluctuations are very probably generated by the interaction between the solid Earth and the atmosphere.|$|R
5|$|Victor's death {{scene was}} filmed outside The Bridge Hotel and pub at Shawford railway bridge, {{next to the}} River Itchen, Hampshire, on 21 July 2000. The cold {{temperature}} {{on the night of}} the shoot and the various technical considerations meant that the scene did not have a big emotional impact upon the cast and crew during filming. However, Renwick briefly felt emotional as he watched Victor's arm falling into the shot and his <b>cap</b> <b>drift</b> away in the gutter. After the exterior sequences had been filmed, the remainder of the episode was recorded at BBC Television Centre in West London on 17 September 2000. Unlike the location shoot, Renwick was too concerned with the complexities of filming to be emotionally affected by the filming of the final episode.|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{prove to}} you that I really did know, I {{will tell you what}} you did. You got out of the window soon after I went away, and went over into Mr. Eldon's garden, where George Eldon and Samuel Warner were digging worms for bait. Then you went with them down to the river. You hid behind them when you passed in sight of the house, for fear that father would see you, as he was out in the yard, pruning trees. Then you went down to the river and sat on a log under some bushes, fishing. After a while you spied an old log canoe, {{drifting}} down the river, and the other boys waded out and got it. Then you all got into it and paddled about a while, and afterward got carried over the rips and upset in the water. Your <b>cap</b> <b>drifted</b> down the stream, and you went after it in the canoe and got it. After that, you took off your stockings and wrung out the water from them, and then came home. You got into the study only about {{a quarter of an hour}} before I came." ...|$|R
