The results showed that medium-saccharified maltodextrin (DE = 18. 4) gave the strongest effect, manifesting itself as a considerable reduction in the viscosity at pasting, a decrease in apparent viscosity during flow, {{and a decrease in}} the storage and loss moduli. Addition of high-(DE = 26. 5) or low-(DE = 10. 5) saccharified maltodextrins had a markedly smaller effect on the rheological properties of starch.

Amorphous TPS films were obtained, irrespective of the additive used. At a relative humidity (RH) of 0 % and 50 % all samples maintained their amorphous nature while at RH 100 % retrogradation was suppressed for all formulated starch films. It is shown that the rate of moisture uptake, and as a consequence, the rate of retrogradation, depends on the molecular weight of the additive. FT-IR and TGA measurements proved a more effective interaction of starch with low molecular weight additives such as maltose and glucose syrup (DE 38. 2) than for the higher molecular weight maltodextrine (DE 19. 1).

40|$|Maltodextrins {{influenced}} the enzymatic activity in aqueous solutions by affecting the water activity (a w) and mobility {{as described by}} viscosity and T'g. In diluted solutions, viscosity being equal, (1) maltodextrin with <b>dextrose</b> <b>equivalents</b> (DE) of 33 was more effective than glucose in limiting horseradish peroxidase (HRP) activity; (2) {{an increase in the}} maltodextrin chain length from DE 33 to DE 8. 7 did not further limited enzymatic activity; (3) the maltodextrin with the highest chain length (DE 2. 5) determined the highest enzyme inhibition. In general, the increase of molecular weight negatively affected the HRP activity by increasing the viscosity and T'g (decreasing molecular mobility) but it positively affected the a w and, in some cases, this compensated the HRP activity inhibition. In concentrated solutions (apparent viscosity ≈ 40 mPa s) the HRP activity decreased with the increase of the maltodextrin molecular weight, and it showed a dependence on T'g which could be described by a William, Landel and Ferry (WLF) -type equation. On the contrary, in the solution added with the maltodextrin with the highest chain length (DE 2. 5) the HRP activity was much higher than that predicted by the WLF-type equation. The maltodextrin with DE 2. 5 contains intact starch fragments and in water forms a suspension. In such a discontinuous system, the viscosity {{in the vicinity of the}} protein is lower than the bulk viscosity, and thus, the enzyme activity is higher than expected. Moreover, since T'g is a property of the soluble phase, it does not explain the mobility in discontinuous system...|$|R

Different assays divided into four groups were used: reaction time (with which {{it was possible to}} reduce the 48 - 72 hour duration reported in the literature to 16 hours with comparable productivity levels); selecting the set of enzymes to be used (different types were evaluated - BAN and Termamyl as alfa-amylases during dextrinisation stage, and AMG, Promozyme and Fungamyl for sacarification reaction- identifying those presenting the best performance during hydrolysis). Reaction conditions were optimised for the process's two stages (destrinisation and sacarification). Enzyme dose, calcium cofactor concentration, pH, temperature and agitation speed were studied for the first stage. Enzyme ratio, pH and agitation speed were studied for sacarification; the latter parameter reported values having no antecedents in the literature (60 rpm and 30 rpm for first and second reactions, respectively). Michaelis Menten kinetics were calculated once conditions had been optimised, varying substrate from 10 - 50 % P/V, obtaining km and Vmax kinetic parameters for each reaction. A kinetic model was found according to local working conditions which was able to explain potato starch conversion to glucose syrup, achieving 96 <b>dextrose</b> <b>equivalents</b> {{by the end of the}} reaction, being well within the maximum range reported in the literature (94 - 98).

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} interactions of {{components in the}} high solids systems during storage. The systems included (i) lactose–maltodextrin (MD) with various <b>dextrose</b> <b>equivalents</b> at different mixing ratios, (ii) whey protein isolate (WPI) –oil [olive oil (OO) or sunflower oil (SO) ] at 75 : 25 ratio, and (iii) WPI–oil– {glucose (G) –fructose (F) 1 : 1 syrup [70 % (w/w) total solids]} at a component ratio of 45 : 15 : 40. Crystallization of lactose was delayed and increasingly inhibited with increasing MD contents and higher DE values (small molecular size or low molecular weight), although all systems showed similar glass transition temperatures at each aw. The water sorption isotherms of non-crystalline lactose and lactose–MD (0. 11 to 0. 76 aw) could be derived from the sum of sorbed water contents of individual amorphous components. The GAB equation was fitted to data of all non-crystalline systems. The protein–oil and protein–oil–sugar materials showed maximum protein oxidation and disulfide bonding at 2 weeks of storage at 20 and 40 °C. The WPI–OO showed denaturation and preaggregation of proteins during storage at both temperatures. The presence of G–F in WPI–oil increased Tonset and Tpeak of protein aggregation, and oxidative damage of the protein during storage, especially in systems with {{a higher level of}} unsaturated fatty acids. Lipid oxidation and glycation products in the systems containing sugar promoted oxidation of proteins, increased changes in protein conformation and aggregation of proteins, and resulted in insolubility of solids or increased hydrophobicity concomitantly with hardening of structure, covalent crosslinking of proteins, and formation of stable polymerized solids, especially after storage at 40 °C.

40|$|The {{agglomeration}} {{phenomenon of}} amorphous particulate material {{is a major}} problem in the food industry. Currently, the glass transition temperature (Tg) is used as a fundamental parameter to describe and control agglomeration. Models are available that describe the kinetics of the agglomeration process {{as a function of the}} distance of the material from Tg (i. e. T - Tg). In practice these models are often not applied because they assume that the powder material is instantly in equilibrium with the humidity conditions of the environment and that solid mobility only occurs at T > Tg. Insights in the kinetics and mechanisms of water transport in powder material can help to better understand and control powder agglomeration. For this purpose, gravimetric step-change water sorption experiments were performed on maltodextrins as a function of the water activity aw. The maltodextrins vary in <b>dextrose</b> <b>equivalents</b> (DE), particle size and morphology. The experimental results were compared with a Fickian diffusion model in order to understand the dependency of the transport mechanism on water concentration gradient and material relaxation. The water transport kinetics in the maltodextrins with low DE (i. e. 6) were well described by Fickian diffusion for low aw, independently of particle size and morphology, until relaxation phenomena started to occur at an aw corresponding to T - Tg = - 20 °C. The importance of the matrix relaxation phenomena on the water transport mechanism increased with increasing DE (i. e. 29 and 32), not showing any relationship with the Tg. The results of this study indicate that the water migration mechanism is controlled by relaxation phenomena when the amorphous material is still far from the glass–rubber transition. The T - Tg at which the relaxation phenomena occur depends on the material. On the contrary, the T - Tg parameter could well describe the onset of agglomeration, independently from the material properties. Therefore, it can be concluded that within the conditions of this study, matrix relaxation occurring far below Tg did not affect the onset of agglomeration...|$|R
40|$|Performance and {{exercise}} capacity in prolonged continuous exercise {{has been shown}} to be enhanced by the ingestion of dilute (- 6 %) carbohydrate-electrolyte (CHO-E) solutions during exercise. There is a wealth of literature on the effects of CHO-E solutions on prolonged, continuous exercise however this is not the case for highintensity intermittent exercise. One reason for this is the difficulty of replicating the demands of multiple-sprint sports within the laboratory. The development of the Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Running Test (LIST), a protocol that simulates the physiological demand of multiple-sprint sports, has allowed for further study in this area. Sports drinks contain a variety of different types of carbohydrate, including synthetic polymers of maltodextrins. The rationale for these is two-fold; firstly there is some evidence to suggest that these glucose polymers of low osmolality may empty faster than isoenergetic glucose solutions especially at dilute (- 6 %) concentrations. Secondly CHO-E solutions formulated from maltodextrins with low <b>dextrose</b> <b>equivalents</b> are less acidogenic and have lower cariogenic potential than simple glucose solutions, thus making them preferable for tooth health. Therefore the purpose of this thesis was to examine the effects of a 6. 4 % hypotonic synthetic polymer maltodextrin CHO-E solution on muscle metabolism and physiological performance during prolonged high-intensity intermittent running (LIST). This thesis contains four experimental studies. From the results of study 1 it was concluded that the ingestion of a 6. 4 % hypotonic CHO-E solution provided no ergogenic benefit to running capacity during the LIST despite blood and hormonal data suggesting that the solution was effective at delivering glucose. As isotonic CHO-E solutions have shown to have ergogenic properties during LIST running the purpose of study 2 was to compare isoenergetic hypotonic and isotonic CHO-E solutions during LIST running. The results from this study suggested that performance, as measured by exercise capacity and sprint speed, was not affected by either treatment. In study 3 the protocol was modified to extend the exercise duration so that a greater demand was placed on the subjects' glycogen reserves. The results from this study further confirmed that exercise capacity in LIST running was not influenced by CHO provision during exercise however the habitual CHO intake of the subjects may have masked any ergogenic properties of the CHO-E solution and led to increased performance in the control trials. In the final study the subjects' pre-trial exercise and dietary CHO intake was manipulated to increase endogenous glycogen concentrations. The results showed that in these subjects the ingestion of a 6. 4 % hypotonic CHO-E solution increased exercise capacity during the LIST by 21 %. Muscle biopsy analyses revealed a lower net muscle glycogen utilisation in the CHO trial post- 90 min (p= 0. 07). There is evidence in the literature to suggest that there is an ergogenic effect of CHO ingestion during the LIST. However the results presented in this thesis suggest that when endogenous glycogen stores are moderate the ingestion of a CHO-E solution may suppress lipid oxidation without a concomitant increase in CHO oxidation and thus LIST capacity is not enhanced. In contrast, when endogenous glycogen concentrations are elevated through dietary manipulation there is an ergogenic benefit from the ingestion of hypotonic CHO-E solutions during LIST exercise.

Six maltodextrin derivatives, M- 040, 100, 150, 180, 500, and 700, with varying <b>dextrose</b> <b>equivalent</b> (DE) values and varying degrees of agglomeration were studied for their suitability in the preparation of the tablets based on the morphological characteristics observed by scanning electron microscopy. A comparison of micromeritic properties, moisture absorption, and morphological characteristics of various maltodextrin derivatives is reported...|$|E

The alcohol yield of the corn syrups approached but did not quite reach theoretical assuming {{that all of the}} <b>dextrose</b> <b>equivalent</b> (DE) solids were fermented. Glucose, sucrose, and 95 DE corn syrup fermented at about the same rate and yielded comparable alcohol contents. At equal solids content, the 42 DE syrup fermented slower in most cases and yielded lower alcohol content than higher DE syrups...|$|E
40|$|Maltodextrin was {{produced}} from cassava and corn starch by enzymatic hydrolysis with alpha-amylase. The cassava starch hydrolysis rate {{was higher than}} that of corn starches in maltodextrin production with shorter <b>dextrose</b> <b>equivalent</b> (DE). DE values do not show directly the nature of the obtained oligosaccharides. Maltodextrin produced from cassava and corn starch was analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the analysis showed that maltodextrin production differs according to the source of the starch. This is important in defining the application of the maltodextrin, according to its desired function...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was {{application}} of-amylase termamyl 2 -x for maltodextrin production from corn starch and evaluation of its industrial uses. The effective parameters were studied in laboratory and pilot plant scale. This process includes preparation of starch suspension, pH adjustment, addition of enzyme and heating under stirring. Before enzyme inactivation, DE and°Brix were controlled continuously. After separation of soluble sections by centrifuge, maltodextrin liquid was dried by spray drier. In this study, DE values at dry matter, were calculated under three enzyme concentrations (0. 2, 0. 25 and 0. 3 ml of-amylase termamyl 2 -x per Kg of starch) and in three different hydrolysis temperatures (60, 65 and 70 °C) at constant pH (6). A completely randomized design with factorial arrangement and 5 replications was conducted. Multiple linear regression was used for relationship between <b>Dextrose</b> <b>Equivalent</b> (DE) and different parameters (enzyme concentration, temperature and hydrolysis time). The results from different enzyme dosage at the same temperature and time of hydrolysis do differ significantly (p = 0. 05). Meanwhile the best enzyme concentration and hydrolysis temperature for maltodextrin (DE between 18 and 19) production after 300 minutes were 0. 25 ml of enzyme per kg of starch and 70 °C, respectively. In these conditions, the least residual starch concentration and-amylase activity were observed.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Bacillus subtilis α-amylase {{was used}} to hydrolyze starch from peeled and whole {{potatoes}} (Solanum tuberosum). Effect of gelatinization temperature, pH, enzyme concentration, temperature of hydrolysis and presence of calcium ions were investigated. Optimum conditions for hydrolysis were when α-amylase levels were 0. 3 percent of the starch concentration {{in the presence of}} 400 ppm calcium at pH 7. 0 and 80 °C for 2 hr. After centrifugation to remove residual material, the supernatants were adjusted to pH 5. 0 to 5. 5 with 30 percent sulfuric acid and heated at 100 °C for 10 min to inactivate α-amylase. Treatment with four percent activated charcoal decolorized the clear hydrolysate before the product was spray dried. The dried product was a light yellow powder, slightly sweet, relatively bland in taste and readily soluble in water. Dried potato hydrolysate made from peeled potatoes had a <b>dextrose</b> <b>equivalent</b> of 30 and contained 85 percent carbohydrates, 8. 4 percent protein and 5. 5 percent ash; while the hydrolysate from whole potatoes had a <b>dextrose</b> <b>equivalent</b> of 26 and contained 86 percent carbohydrates, 8. 4 percent protein and 6. 0 percent ash. The composition of the carbohydrates of the two hydrolysates were similar except the hydrolysate from peeled contained a higher concentration of glucose and lower concentration of saccharides with a degree of polymerization greater than four. At concentrations of greater than 40 percent, the potato hydrolysate made from whole potatoes did not show as high a viscosity as commercial corn syrup solids with a <b>dextrose</b> <b>equivalent</b> of 24; the potato hydrolysate adsorbed twice as much moisture as the commercial corn syrup solids at 75 percent relative humidity at 23 °C for 30 days. Substitution of sucrose with whole potato hydrolysate in chocolate milk revealed that substitution of two parts of sucrose by two parts of potato hydrolysate could be used with a slight loss of desirability. Fifty and one hundred percent addition of whole potato hydrolysate to a commercial dehydrated vegetable soup mix showed no decrease in the desirability of the product. This work has shown that a useful potato hydrolysate containing significant amounts of protein can be prepared from either peeled or whole potatoes...|$|E
40|$|Corn {{and wheat}} {{starches}} {{as well as}} wheat and cassava flours were hydrolyzed using sorghum malt at 65 °C for 6 hours. During these reactions, <b>dextrose</b> <b>equivalent</b> (DE) values were followed under 3 concentrations of sorghum malt and of calcium chloride. Wheat flour presented the highest DE values and cassava flour had the highest hydrolysis yield. Thus, different dextrins were produced in a pilot plant and were analyzed by HPSEC and HPAEC-PAD for their molecular weight distribution and oligosaccharides composition respectively. The results indicated that oligosaccharides with broad molecular weight distributions {{were present in the}} dextrins produced and that the proportion of maltose was very high. Peer reviewe...|$|E
