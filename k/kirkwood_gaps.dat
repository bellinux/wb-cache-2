5|$|Along {{with the}} Sun, the {{gravitational}} influence of Jupiter has {{helped shape the}} Solar System. The orbits {{of most of the}} system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's orbital plane than the Sun's equatorial plane (Mercury is the only planet that is closer to the Sun's equator in orbital tilt), the <b>Kirkwood</b> <b>gaps</b> in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner Solar System's history.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of Neptune has {{a profound effect}} on the Kuiper belt's structure due to orbital resonances. Over a timescale comparable to the age of the Solar System, Neptune's gravity destabilises the orbits of any objects that happen to lie in certain regions, and either sends them into the inner Solar System or out into the scattered disc or interstellar space. This causes the Kuiper belt to have pronounced gaps in its current layout, similar to the <b>Kirkwood</b> <b>gaps</b> in the asteroid belt. In the region between 40 and 42 AU, for instance, no objects can retain a stable orbit over such times, and any observed in that region must have migrated there relatively recently.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the Hungaria group of asteroids is well known. At the 4:1 orbital {{resonance}} with Jupiter that lies at semi-major axes of 2.06 AU, any orbiting body is sufficiently strongly perturbed to be forced into an extremely eccentric and unstable orbit, creating the innermost <b>Kirkwood</b> <b>gap.</b> Interior to this 4:1 resonance, asteroids in low inclination orbits are, unlike those outside the 4:1 <b>Kirkwood</b> <b>gap,</b> strongly influenced by the gravitational field of Mars. Here, instead of Jupiter's influence, perturbations by Mars have, over the lifetime of the Solar System, thrown out all asteroids interior to the 4:1 <b>Kirkwood</b> <b>gap</b> except for those far enough from Mars's orbital plane where that planet exerts much smaller forces.|$|R

40|$|An {{effective}} {{mechanism for}} the placement of asteroidal fragments into earth-crossing orbits is discussed. It is pointed out that an asteroid in an orbit with a semimajor axis of about 3. 27 AU, corresponding to the most apparent <b>Kirkwood</b> <b>Gap,</b> has a period almost exactly half that of Jupiter and will experience strong resonant perturbations by Jupiter. In the proposed mechanism, fragments 10 to 500 m in diameter resulting from collisions between asteroids located just outside the region in which libration due to the perturbations takes place are injected into the <b>Kirkwood</b> <b>Gap...</b>|$|R
25|$|In the {{asteroid}} belt within 3.5 AU from the Sun, the major mean-motion resonances with Jupiter are locations of gaps in {{the asteroid}} distribution, the <b>Kirkwood</b> <b>gaps</b> (most notably at the 4:1, 3:1, 5:2, 7:3 and 2:1 resonances). Asteroids have been ejected from these almost empty lanes by repeated perturbations. However, there are still populations of asteroids temporarily present in or near these resonances. For example, asteroids of the Alinda family are in or close to the 3:1 resonance, with their orbital eccentricity steadily increased by interactions with Jupiter until they eventually have a close encounter with an inner planet that ejects them from the resonance.|$|E

50|$|A large {{proportion}} of vestoids have orbital elements {{similar to those of}} Vesta, either close enough {{to be part of the}} Vesta family, or having similar eccentricities and inclinations but with a semi-major axis lying between about 2.18 AU and the 3:1 <b>Kirkwood</b> <b>gap</b> at 2.50 AU. This suggests that they originated as fragments of Vesta's crust. There seem to be two populations of Vestoids, one created 2 billion years ago and the other 1 billion years ago, coming respectively from the enormous southern-hemisphere craters Veneneia and Rheasilvia.

50|$|Kirkwood Observatory is {{an astronomical}} {{observatory}} {{owned and operated}} by Indiana University. It is located in Bloomington, Indiana (USA). It is named for Daniel Kirkwood (1814-1895) an astronomer and professor of mathematics at Indiana University who discovered the divisions of the asteroid belt known as the <b>Kirkwood</b> <b>Gaps.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most of the <b>Kirkwood</b> <b>gaps</b> are depleted, {{unlike the}} mean-motion {{resonances}} (MMR) of Neptune or Jupiter's 3:2 resonance, that retain objects captured during the giant planet migration of the Nice model. The loss of {{objects from the}} <b>Kirkwood</b> <b>gaps</b> {{is due to the}} overlapping of the ν5 and ν6 secular resonances within the mean-motion resonances. The orbital elements of the asteroids vary chaotically as a result and evolve onto planet-crossing orbits within a few million years. The 2:1 MMR has a few relatively stable islands within the resonance, however. These islands are depleted due to slow diffusion onto less stable orbits. This process, which has been linked to Jupiter and Saturn being near a 5:2 resonance, may have been more rapid when Jupiter's and Saturn's orbits were closer together.|$|E

50|$|The 4:1 {{resonance}} <b>Kirkwood</b> <b>gap</b> (at 2.06 AU) {{marks the}} outer {{boundary of the}} Hungaria family, while interactions with Mars determine the inner boundary.

50|$|Examples {{include the}} 2:3 commensurability between the orbital periods of Neptune and Pluto, the 3:4 commensurability between the orbital periods of the Saturnian {{satellites}} Titan and Hyperion, the orbital periods {{associated with the}} <b>Kirkwood</b> <b>gaps</b> in the asteroid belt relative to that of Jupiter, and the 2:1 commensurability between Gliese 876 b and Gliese 876 c.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, this {{difference}} is non-negligible for any purposes where precision is of importance. As an example, the asteroid Ceres has osculating orbital elements (at epoch November 26, 2005)while its proper orbital elements (independent of epoch) areA notable exception to this small-difference rule are asteroids lying in the <b>Kirkwood</b> <b>gaps,</b> which are in strong orbital resonance with Jupiter.|$|E
50|$|More recently, a {{relatively}} small number of asteroids have been found to possess high eccentricity orbits which do lie within the <b>Kirkwood</b> <b>gaps.</b> Examples include the Alinda family and the Griqua family. These orbits slowly increase their eccentricity on a timescale of tens of millions of years, and will eventually break out of the resonance due to close encounters with a major planet.|$|E
5000|$|... 6 Hebe is {{extremely}} well placed to send impact debris to Earth-crossing orbits.

500|$|The main gaps {{occur at}} the 3:1, 5:2, 7:3, and 2:1 mean-motion {{resonances}} with Jupiter. An asteroid in the 3:1 <b>Kirkwood</b> <b>gap</b> would orbit the Sun three times for each Jovian orbit, for instance. Weaker resonances occur at other semi-major axis values, with fewer asteroids found than nearby. (For example, an 8:3 resonance for asteroids with a semi-major axis of 2.71 AU.) ...|$|R
