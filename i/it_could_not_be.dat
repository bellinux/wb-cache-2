5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that a}} non-return valve in the fuel system had been installed the wrong way round causing two of the engines to be starved of fuel. The technician found responsible for incorrectly fitting the valve was charged under the Air Force Act. Following the accident, the non-return valve was re-designed so <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> installed incorrectly.|$|E

6000|$|On October 10, 1856, {{about four}} hundred people were camped in Tasajara Valley, California. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> for the prospect, since a more barren, dreary, monotonous, and uninviting {{landscape}} never stretched before human eye; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> for convenience or contiguity, as the nearest settlement was thirty miles away; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> for health or salubrity, as {{the breath of}} the ague-haunted tules in the outlying Stockton marshes swept through the valley; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> for space or comfort, for, encamped on an unlimited plain, {{men and women were}} huddled together as closely as in an urban tenement-house, without the freedom or decency of rural isolation; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> for pleasant companionship, as dejection, mental anxiety, tears, and lamentation were the dominant expression; it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a hurried flight from present or impending calamity, for the camp had been deliberately planned, and for a week pioneer wagons had been slowly arriving; it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> an irrevocable exodus, for some had already returned to their homes that others might take their places. It was simply a religious revival of one or two denominational sects, known as a [...] "camp-meeting." ...|$|R

5|$|Many logical flaws {{were found}} in COBOL 60, leading GE's Charles Katz to warn that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{interpreted}} unambiguously. A reluctant short-term committee enacted a total cleanup and, by March 1963, {{it was reported that}} COBOL's syntax was as definable as ALGOL's, although semantic ambiguities remained.|$|E
5|$|ANA was of {{the opinion}} that if a small amount of water entered a fuel tank during {{refuelling}} it would only reach the drain cocks when the aircraft was in level flight so <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> detected immediately after re-fuelling. For 15 years ANA had operated in the knowledge that the only satisfactory time to check fuel tanks for the presence of water was prior to the first flight of the day, after the aircraft had been stationary overnight. Throughout this time ANA checked fuel tanks for the presence of water prior to the first flight of the day.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Bethe {{also played}} an {{important}} role in the development of the hydrogen bomb, though he had originally joined the project with the hope of proving <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> made. Bethe later campaigned with Albert Einstein and the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists against nuclear testing and the nuclear arms race. He helped persuade the Kennedy and Nixon administrations to sign, respectively, the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (SALT I).|$|E

5|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{considered}} a large air {{arm in the}} wider context of World War II, the ZNDH nonetheless had on its charge {{at one time or}} another some 650 aircraft between April 1941 and May 1945, as well as anti-aircraft and paratroop units. From humble beginnings in 1941, the ZNDH was still providing some measure of air-support (fighter, attack and transport) until the last days of World War II in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Highway 82 {{was now a}} four-lane road all the {{way from}} Glenwood Springs to Aspen. But that traffic still had to narrow to two lanes to cross the Maroon Creek Bridge at the latter city's western boundary. The old bridge, listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1985, was {{functionally}} obsolete and structurally deficient. Cracks and other damage were forcing temporary closures of the bridge to trucks. Over 100 years old by that point, the oldest bridge in use on a Colorado highway, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> expanded any further.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s, the {{population}} of Berlin was growing rapidly with the influx of around 50,000 people a year, creating a large administrative burden. When construction began on the Rotes Rathaus, the city had around half a million inhabitants, but this grew to 800,000 {{by the time of}} its completion in 1869. By the 1880s, the city had offices in ten additional buildings near the Rotes Rathaus and since <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> extended, it was clear that a second administration building was required.|$|E

5|$|On 21 October 1960, {{the initial}} {{tethered}} flight, performed by XP831, {{was conducted at}} Dunsfold; {{at this stage of}} development, this feat had required the airframe to have been stripped of all extraneous weight and restrictions on the engine meant <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> run at full power for more than 2.5 minutes at a time. Several tethered flights took place, partially so that the test pilots could familiarise themselves with the hovering controls; on 4 November, the first tethered flight without use of the auto-stabiliser system was accomplished. In mid-November, conventional taxying trials were performed at speeds of up to 70 knots.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Britain proved for {{the first}} time that the Junkers Ju 87 was {{vulnerable}} in hostile skies against well-organised and determined fighter opposition. The Ju 87, like other dive bombers, was slow and possessed inadequate defences. Furthermore, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> effectively protected by fighters because of its low speed, and the very low altitudes at which it ended its dive bomb attacks. The Stuka depended on air superiority, the very thing being contested over Britain. It was withdrawn from attacks on Britain in August after prohibitive losses, leaving the Luftwaffe without precision ground-attack aircraft.|$|E

After Lucas opted for a drawn theatrical poster, Drew Struzan, the artist responsible for the Special Edition posters, was commissioned to illustrate, and the poster was unveiled on March 11, 1999. Lucasfilm dictated that, contractually, Struzan's illustration was the only art the foreign distributors could use, and other than the text, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> modified in any way.|$|E

5|$|While the Australian Government offered MacArthur ICorps {{for service}} in Leyte and Luzon, nothing came of several {{proposals}} to utilise {{it in the}} liberation of these islands. The Army's prolonged period of relative inactivity during 1944 led to public concern, and many Australians believed that the AIF should be demobilised if <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> used for offensive operations. This was politically embarrassing for the government, and helped motivate it to look for new areas where the military could be employed.|$|E
5|$|A {{forensic}} {{examination of}} Docherty's body indicated she {{had probably been}} suffocated, but <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> proven. Although the police suspected the men of other murders, {{there was no evidence}} on which they could take action. An offer was put to Hare granting immunity from prosecution if he turned king's evidence. He provided the details of Docherty's murder and confessed to all 16 deaths; formal charges were made against Burke and his wife for three murders. At the subsequent trial Burke was found guilty of one murder and sentenced to death. The case against his wife was found not proven—a Scottish legal verdict to acquit an individual but not declare them innocent. Burke was hanged shortly afterwards, his corpse was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the Anatomical Museum of Edinburgh Medical School where, as of 2017, it remains.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russian Civil War {{the victorious}} Bolsheviks {{considered}} finishing Izmail, and possibly Borodino, to their original design. It would have taken at least two years to build all of Izmails turrets, even if enough guns had been available. Ten had been delivered by Vickers before the Revolution and one gun had been completed domestically in 1912, but the prospects that more guns could be purchased from Vickers or that the Soviets could make more were not promising, given the state of their heavy industry {{in the wake of the}} Civil War. Another problem was the complicated electrical system; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> completed under current conditions, and at least twenty months would be required to replace it with a simpler system.|$|E

5|$|Although airpower {{was to be}} a {{major factor}} in the defense of Lima Site 85, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> applied without {{limitations}} and restrictions. The defense of Lima Site 85 was not the sole focus of limited air resources at the time. During this period, the 1968 Tet Offensive was underway in South Vietnam, the Marine outpost at Khe Sanh was under siege, and there existed an unprecedented flow of enemy logistical traffic which had to be interdicted. Lima Site 85 had provided direction to about a quarter of the USAF missions over North Vietnam and Barrel Roll from November1967 to 11March1968. No other facility existed to provide a similar coverage over these areas. While this loss was a serious blow to the USAF air effort, it was not crippling.|$|E
5|$|By January 1957, {{with the}} tests just months away, a {{tentative}} schedule had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next. Because Short Granite was {{too large to}} fit into a missile or guided bomb, this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested. In December 1956, Cook had proposed another design, known as Green Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could fit into a Yellow Sun casing that could be used by the Blue Steel guided missile then under development; but <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> made ready to reach Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would cost another £1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|By age 11, he had {{exhausted}} {{the mathematical}} knowledge of two {{college students who}} were lodgers at his home. He was later lent a book by S. L. Loney on advanced trigonometry. He mastered this {{by the age of}} 13 while discovering sophisticated theorems on his own. By 14, he was receiving merit certificates and academic awards that continued throughout his school career, and he assisted the school in the logistics of assigning its 1200 students (each with differing needs) to its 35-odd teachers. He completed mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and showed a familiarity with geometry and infinite series. Ramanujan was shown how to solve cubic equations in 1902; he developed his own method to solve the quartic. The following year, Ramanujan tried to solve the quintic, not knowing that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> solved by radicals.|$|E
