40|$|The {{results of}} a {{theoretical}} study on the flexural behaviour of continuous high-strength concrete (HSC) beams prestressed with external fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) tendons are presented. A previously developed numerical model is extended {{to the analysis of}} continuous HSC beams with external FRP tendons. A numerical test is conducted on two-span externally prestressed beams made of HSC with compressive strength of 90 MPa. The external tendons are assumed to be carbon FRP (CFRP) composites covering a wide range of modulus of elasticity. Various levels of nonprestressed steel ratio are used. Comprehensive aspects of behaviour of such type of beams are examined. The results show that CFRP with high elastic modulus of 500 GPa mobilizes quite different structural responses compared to those with <b>normal</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>modulus,</b> and that the amount of nonprestressed steel affects remarkably the behaviour of such beams. The study also indicates that some moment redistribution knowledge valid for conventional continuous concrete beams may not be applicable to continuous HSC beams with external FRP tendons...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{established}} that alkali aggregate reaction (AAR) causes extensive random cracking in concrete and reduces the tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and to a certain extent, the compressive strength. This would undoubtedly bring {{the safety of the}} structure into question and may require extensive repairs to be carried out.

The damaged RC columns were confined with one and two layers of high and <b>normal</b> <b>modulus</b> carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) and tested under uniaxial compression. A damaged column without CFRP confinement was also prepared for comparison purposes. The results show that the mechanical property of concrete damaged by AAR does not affect the load carrying capacity of RC column. Time of CFRP application and types of CFRP modulus provides active or passive confinement effect on RC columns. Confinement with high modulus CFRP is not effective in controlling the AAR expansion in the concrete due to its low tensile strain capacity.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of direct {{numerical}} simulation of the motion of a two-dimensional circular cylinder in Couette flow and in Poiseuille flow of an Oldroyd-B fluid. Both neutrally buoyant and non-neutrally buoyant cylinders are considered. The cylinder 2 Ì 7 s motion and the mechanisms which cause the cylinders to migrate are studied. The stable equilibrium position of neutrally buoyant particles varies with inertia, elasticity, shear thinning and the blockage ratio of the channel in both shear flows. Shear thinning promotes the migration of the cylinder to the wall while inertia causes the cylinder to migrate away from the wall. The cylinder moves closer to the wall in a narrower channel. In a Poiseuille flow, the effect of <b>elastic</b> <b>normal</b> stresses is manifested by an attraction toward the nearby wall if the blockage is strong. If the blockage is weak, the normal stresses act through the curvature of the inflow velocity profile and generate a lateral force that points to the centreline.
