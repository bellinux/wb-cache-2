5|$|Treloar {{became the}} acting {{director}} of the Australian War Museum in 1920 after Gullett resigned from the position and became head of the Australian Immigration Bureau. Gullet later wrote the official history of Australia's involvement in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Treloar was 26 years of age at the time he became director of the Museum and was responsible for the difficult task of establishing the institution. Between 1920 and 1922 he personally undertook much of the work associated with developing the Museum's first major exhibition, which opened in Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building on Anzac Day 1922. During this period the staff of the Australian War Museum were also responsible for providing administrative support <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> to distribute captured German equipment as war trophies to the Australian states. Treloar {{was a member of the}} committee overseeing this effort, and the associated administrative load came close to overwhelming him.|$|E

25|$|By {{assuming}} {{only one}} {{program would be}} running at a time, the engineers were able to ignore the concept of reentrancy; the ability <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> (or library) to be stopped at any point, asked to do something else, {{and then return to}} the original task. In the case of QuickDraw for example, this means the system can store state information internally, like the current location of the window or the line style, knowing it would only change under control of the running program. Taking this one step further, the engineers left most of this state inside the application rather than in QuickDraw, thus eliminating the need to copy this data between the application and library.|$|E
25|$|For any Type A {{program which}} are {{considered}} to be a high risk of not complying, the OMB Circular A-133 requires that the auditor to perform a compliance audit on that program. For a Type A program that is considered to be of low risk, then the auditor is not required to perform a compliance audit, although the OMB Circular A-133 allows the auditor to do so if he/she chooses to. Although the risk assessment is performed by the auditor based on his/her judgment, the OMB Circular A-133 does have two requirements <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> to be considered low risk. First, the program must have been audited at least once in the last two years, and second, the program must have no audit findings when it was last audited. If the program does not comply with either of these two requirements, it is automatically considered as high risk.|$|E
25|$|The borough {{was created}} in 1928, {{centered}} on and named after a formerly independent municipality within the Federal District, which already had governing authority {{over a number of}} surrounding communities. The modern borough is made up of 15 “barrios” or neighborhoods, considered to be part of city of Iztapalapa, and 18 other “pueblos” or communities outside of it. To distinguish the original city of Iztapalapa {{from the rest of the}} borough, it was officially named Iztapalapa de Cuitláhuac in 2006 in honor of the tenth Aztec emperor. However, eight of the barrios are considered to be the historic center of the city of Iztapalapa, which are La Asunción, San Ignacio, Santa Barbara, San Lucas, San Pablo, San Miguel, San Pedro and San José. Records of the “eight barrios of Iztapalapa” go back at least until 1898. Borough authorities have sought “Barrios Mágicos Turísticos” (Magical Tourism Neighborhoods) status for these, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> similar to the “Pueblos Mágicos” tourism program run by the federal government. The goal is to attract visitors to these neighborhoods as well as other landmarks of the borough such as the Cerro de la Estrella, Pueblo Culhuacán, the Churubusco Gardens, La Magdalena Atlazolpa, Los Reyes, San Antonio Culhuacán, Mexicalzingo, the San Lorenzo Cemetery, San Andrés Tetepilco and San José Aculco.|$|E

25|$|In Rome, Diệm {{obtained}} {{an audience}} with Pope Pius XII at the Vatican before undertaking further lobbying across Europe. He also met with French and Vietnamese officials in Paris and sent a message indicating {{that he was willing}} to be the Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam to Bảo Đại. But Bảo Đại then refused to meet him. Diệm returned to the United States to continue building support among Americans. Nonetheless, to Americans, the fact that Diệm was an anti-communist could not distinguish him from Bảo Đại and other State of Vietnam leaders. Some American officials worried that his Catholic devoutness could hinder his ability to mobilize support in a non-Catholic predominant country. Diệm recognized that hesitation and in the course of his lobbying, besides anti-communism and religious factors, Diệm also focused on another ground: ideas of development, since the US was enthusiastic in applying their technology and knowledge to modernize postcolonial countries. With the help of Fishel, Diệm was appointed as a consultant to Michigan State University's Government Research Bureau, where Fishel worked. MSU was administering government-sponsored assistance programs for cold war allies, and Diệm helped Fishel to lay the foundation <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> later implemented in South Vietnam, the Michigan State University Vietnam Advisory Group.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the RRC changed as the {{government}} became increasingly authoritarian. Immediately after its creation, its experienced core of technocrats produced highly regarded analyses of Ethiopian famine and ably carried out famine relief efforts. However, by the 1980s, the Derg had compromised its mission. The RRC began with the innocuous scheme of creating village workforces from the unemployed in state farms, and government agricultural schemes but, as the counter-insurgency intensified, the RRC was given responsibility <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> of forced resettlement and villagization. As the go-between for international aid organizations and foreign donor governments, the RRC redirected food to government militias, in particular in Eritrea and Tigray. It also encouraged international agencies to set up relief programs in regions with surplus grain production, which allowed the AMC to collect the excess food. Finally, the RRC carried out a disinformation campaign during the 1980s famine, in which it portrayed the famine as being solely the result of drought and overpopulation and tried to deny {{the existence of the}} armed conflict that was occurring precisely in the famine-affected regions. The RRC also claimed that the aid being given by it and its international agency partners were reaching all of the famine victims.|$|E
25|$|The first {{international}} Baha'i Youth Conference held in Costa Rica came about in 1972 {{two days after}} the Managua earthquake. However a minibus full of young people came through Honduras with only minor difficulties and two Nicaraguan youth got through. Total attendance was about seventy-five. 1977 also saw the first time a Bahá'í float was entered in one of the annualfestivals in Santa Cruz. A larger conference of about 200 gathered in January 1978. Some of the attendees, together with various adults, then took a trip into Guanacaste province where over a short time 14 new assemblies were founded and then they extended work into Meseta province (see San Ramón for mention of this remote province) where several groups were re-contacted and a new assembly elected. In 1983 the Universal House of Justice recognized the twin youth conferences of Honduras and Costa Rica held in early March - a challenge representing a substantial {{increase in the number of}} youth Bahá'ís - and called on them to consider the example of `Abdu'l-Bahá in civilizing influences they should undertake individually and collectively. In the fall of 1984 a permanent site for the National Youth Institute was chosen and plans were developed for it to serve as a center for the arts and performance, agriculture and outreach programs. A television crew made up of two youth from EI Salvador, a Bahá'í from Venezuela, and two non-Baha'i volunteers filmed Costa Rica's 1988 international youth conference which was attended by 120 people <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> to be aired in El Salvador.|$|E
