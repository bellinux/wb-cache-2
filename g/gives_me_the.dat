25|$|The reason I didn't {{review the}} book is that it perhaps would have taken me three weeks. My {{appreciation}} {{of it is that}} diverse and that complicated... John is perhaps the only contemporary writer who I know now who <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> sense of the fact that life is—the life that we perform is in an environment that enjoys a grandeur that escapes us. Rabbit is very much possessed of a paradise lost, of a paradise known fleetingly perhaps through erotic love and a paradise that he pursues through his children. It's the vastness of John's scope that I would have described if I could through a review.|$|E

It is {{probable}} {{that they were not}} preparing the seedcakes in accordance with Aboriginal food preparation methods, as the food was a staple among the local people. It has been argued that they did not first process the food into a paste, which might have prevented the ill effects they suffered. Despite eating, the men got weaker and weaker. Wills wrote in his diary:My pulse is at 48 and very weak and my legs and arms are nearly skin and bone. I can only look out like Mr Micawber for something to turn up, but starvation on nardoo is by no means unpleasant, but for the weakness one feels, and the utter inability to move oneself, for as the appetite is concerned, it <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> greatest satisfaction.|$|E

Carradine said he even sold his Kung Fu residuals to raise money for his own projects, and consequently gone into debt. [...] He also sought advice from directors he had worked with, including Martin Scorsese and Ingmar Bergman. [...] "The wonderful thing about working with good directors, Carradine admitted, is it <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to pick their brains for my own films."

It <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> freedom to sing as powerfully as I want and to rewrite the songs specifically for the genre." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, who was critical of the song's original version, praised the [...] "Vintage Throwback Remix". He felt it was more of what the original [...] "should have been" [...] and concluded: [...] "a rousing vocal arrangement at the song's climax sells Mariah's inspirational message of perseverance and harks back to her '90s heyday." [...] Idolator's Becky Bain called the remix far more [...] "captivating" [...] than the original, and felt its re-recorded vocals showcased the singer's [...] "one-of-a-kind range." ...|$|E

[...] He also said that he wanted to make a film dedicated to father-son relationships, which were, in his opinion, [...] "neglected" [...] in Bollywood. Khan's idea was to make a simple family drama which expanded into an action film. He declined to make the film in English to increase its appeal for Western audiences, feeling that [...] "cracking Hollywood on their terms" [...] was unnecessary. Both Khan and Sinha credited their children for providing encouragement, and regularly [...] "approving" [...] the film's execution.|$|E

500|$|In the 2016 MLS Cup Final against Seattle, held at BMO Field on 10 December, Giovinco's {{performance}} was largely stifled by Seattle's heavy and aggressive defending, despite initially creating an early goalscoring chance for Altidore; throughout the match, he was fouled {{a total of}} six times and had several shots blocked. A scoring opportunity came in the 48th minute, but his shot was skewed wide of the near post. He was eventually substituted for Tosaint Ricketts in the 103rd minute, due to an apparent injury, and consequently, despite being the club's main penalty kick taker, was not used in the resulting shoot-out, which Toronto lost 5–4, following a 0–0 draw after extra-time. Regarding Giovinco's surprising substitution, Toronto's coach, Greg Vanney, stated in the post-match press conference: [...] "He couldn't move. He looked at me. It's not like I take him off because I want to. I look at him and he <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> sign that he can’t go any more and when he feels like he can’t go, he feels like he’s more of a liability to the group than anything. That’s the decision. It's not one that I generally want to make, but we had to." ...|$|E
500|$|Stebbins' {{early work}} with lizards in the {{southern}} California desert led {{to a series of}} papers from the 1950s through the 1970s exploring the parietal eye of reptiles (also called the [...] "third eye", a tiny light-sensitive organ on the forehead) and the associated pineal gland, both of which are now known to influence circadian rhythms. Aided by a Senior Postdoctoral Fellowship from the National Science Foundation, Stebbins and colleagues found that lizards with the parietal eye surgically removed changed their behavior: they became active much earlier in the day, spent more time in the sun, and remained active much later than control lizards. Further studies over the next few decades focused on the parietal eye of the tuatara, the pineal gland's effects on lizard reproductive behavior, and parietal skull openings in fossil [...] "mammal-like reptiles" [...] such as Lystrosaurus. His work had implications beyond reptile biology: Nobel laureate Julius Axelrod, after reading the work of Stebbins and others, began investigating the pineal gland in mammals, with emphasis on the effect of melatonin on activity cycles. Melatonin has since been found to influence human health. Stebbins was proud of his parietal and pineal work, calling it [...] "possibly the single piece of research which <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> most satisfaction." ...|$|E

DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{said it was}} [...] "probably the best episode" [...] of the season, and commented that [...] "Dancin' Homer" [...] offered a [...] "consistently satisfying show. Like the better episodes, it packed a lot of action into its twenty-three minutes, as Homer’s saga took on a near epic feeling. It also contained more wonderfully bizarre asides than usual {{at this point in}} the series’ run. From the Rastafarians who appear in the crowd when Homer performs 'Baby Elephant Walk', to the existence of the Players’ Ex-Wives section at the ballpark, the episode provided a fun and rich program."
