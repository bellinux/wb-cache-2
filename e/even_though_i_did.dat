40|$|This thesis can {{generally}} {{be described as}} a close reading of Schelling's treatise Über das Wesen der menschlichen Freiheit (1809) in conjunction with a limited number of references to his later work Die Weltalter. This reading, however, is neither a line by line reading of the entire text, nor is it simply an "innocent" exposition. It is informed by Heidegger's reading of this text in Schellings Abhandlung Über das Wesen der menschlichen Freiheit, and attempts to confront a specific question arising from Heidegger's reading: the question of negativity. Schelling's conception of freedom, and its relation to system, I will argue, leads to a conception of negativity which complicates, if not displaces, certain assumptions or even the entirety of modern subjectivity. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not argue that Heidegger inherits this problem from Schelling, the date of this lecture course (1936) suggests that it coincides with a period of radicalization in Heidegger's thought.

5000|$|The {{importance}} that one [...] "look Indian" [...] can {{be greater than}} one's biological or legal status. Native American Literature professor Becca Gercken-Hawkins writes about the trouble of recognition {{for those who do}} not look Indian; [...] "I self-identify as Cherokee and Irish American, and <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not look especially Indian with my dark curly hair and light skin, I easily meet my tribe's blood quantum standards. My family has been working for years to get the documentation that will allow us to be enrolled members of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. Because of my appearance and my lack of enrollment status, I expect questions regarding my identity, but even so, I was surprised when a fellow graduate student advised me—in all seriousness—to straighten my hair and work on a tan before any interviews. Thinking she was joking, I asked if I should put a feather in my hair, and she replied with a straight face that a feather might be a bit much, but I should at least wear traditional Native jewelry." ...|$|R

However, {{it was only when}} Wood saw her act in a show by BBC Scotland called Eighty-One Take Two that she was impressed enough to hire her friend for the show. Imrie played various roles throughout the run, like a co-presenter of McConomy (a spoof TV economy show), and most famously Miss Babs in Acorn Antiques. Imrie said in 2007, [...] "Miss Babs is still what Im best known for, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> go around with bright yellow hair." [...] During her run in As Seen On TV Imrie received a fan letter from playwright Alan Bennett. [...] "He wrote a card to me saying he adored Miss Babs. You cant imagine how thrilling that was. I still have that card today." [...] Imrie though believes that the praise should go to Woods writing: [...] "Every word is of huge importance and crafted to perfection.

6000|$|An {{opportunity}} soon occurred, when I {{broached the}} subject by asking Mr. Hardinge whether my father, in his will, had ordered that I {{should be sent}} to Yale, and there be educated for the bar. He had done nothing of the sort. Had he left any particular request, writing, or message on the subject, at all? Not that Mr. Hardinge knew. It is true, the last had heard his friend, once or twice, make some general remark which would lead one to suppose that Captain Wallingford had some vague expectations I might go to the bar, but nothing further. My mind felt vastly relieved by these admissions, for I knew my mother's tenderness too well to anticipate that she would dream of absolutely dictating in a matter that was so clearly connected with my own happiness and tastes. When questioned on this last point, Mr. Hardinge did not hesitate to say that my mother had conversed with him several times concerning her views, as related to my career in life. She wished me to go to Yale, and then to read law, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not practise. As soon as this, much was said, the conscientious servant of God paused, to note the effect on me. Reading disappointment in my countenance, I presume, he immediately added, [...] "But your mother, Miles, laid no restraint on you; for she knew it was you who was to follow the career, and not herself. 'I should as soon think of commanding whom he was to marry, as to think of forcing, a profession on him,' she added. 'He is the one who is to decide this, and he only. We may try to guide and influence him, but not go beyond this. I leave you, dear sir, to do all you think best in this matter, certain that your own wisdom will be aided by the providence of a kind Master.'" ...|$|E

And this," [...] she added with the ghost of a smile, [...] "you cannot now pretend, Luke, after all that you said just now. It is not that my mind wanted making up. My mind has {{very little to do with}} it all. It knows just as my heart does that I could not now live without you. I'm not talking nonsense, Luke, and I seem to be too old for mere sentimental twaddle; therefore, when I say that I could not now live parted from you, I say it from the {{innermost}} conviction of my heart. Sh--sh--dear," [...] she whispered, seeing that he wished to interrupt her, [...] "don't try and say anything just yet--not just yet--until I have told you everything. I want you to remember, Luke, that I am no longer very young, and that ever since I can remember anything, I have loved you. I must have loved you <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know it. But if you had never spoken of love to me, if you had never written that letter which I received in Brussels, I probably would have been satisfied to go on with my humdrum life to the end of time; who knows? I might have found contentment if not happiness, by and by with some other man. We women are meant to marry. Men are fond of telling us that our only mission on earth is to marry. But all this possible, quiet content one letter has dissipated. I could never be happy now, never, save in continuing to love you. Life to me would be unspeakably hideous without you and your love. Therefore, I say, Luke, that you have no longer any right to keep me at arm's length. You have no right, having once come into my life, having once given substance and vitality to my love, to withdraw yourself away from me. Love, dear, is a bond, a mutual bond, as sacred, as binding as any that are contracted on this earth. You--when you wrote that letter, when first you spoke to me of love--entered into a bond with me. You have no right to force me to break it." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{committee}} {{has played a}} somewhat controversial role in Norwegian politics. Following the Moscow theater hostage crisis in October 2002, Ingvald Godal said of the terrorists that [...] "I understand their action, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not defend it". He later claimed that he failedly attempted to enlist Norway as a negotiator during the crisis. In November the same year, ahead of a state visit by Vladimir Putin in Norway, Ingvald Godal filed a prosecution request to the Police of Norway. He also suggested that the Prime Minister of Norway take initiative to an international criminal tribunal for Chechnya. The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that a police prosecution of a foreign head of state is not possible, and rebuffed the latter proposal. During Putin's visit, the committee held a demonstration together with Amnesty International, the Norwegian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights and Norwegian Church Aid. The {{committee has}} engaged in other peaceful protests, such as a 2007 memorial of Anna Politkovskaya {{in cooperation with the}} Helsinki Committee, the Norwegian PEN, the Human Rights House, the Norwegian Union of Journalists and Nobel Peace Center.|$|R

Metaphorically speaking, it sometimes seems as if the innately life-sustaining trees are asked to grow and perform their natural balancing act of conversion without enough sun, water and space to survive, let alone enough to flourish.

I can recognize its presence by a movement towards wholeness within individuals and in their relation with each other and with society.
