25|$|Why {{this style}} gained {{mainstream}} acceptance in the 1950s {{is a matter}} of debate. American social realism had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the Great Depression, but also by the muralists of Mexico such as David Alfaro Siqueiros and Diego Rivera. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of these painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the <b>early</b> <b>forties</b> at galleries in New York such as The Art of This Century Gallery. The McCarthy era after World War II was a time of artistic censorship in the United States, but if the subject matter were totally abstract then it would be seen as apolitical, and therefore safe.

40|$|Objective: In the <b>early</b> <b>fourties</b> of {{the past}} century, Kallmann and {{coworkers}} reported on {{a small number of}} patients, most of them with normal intelligence, in whom a combination of eunuchoidism and anosmia was present. About two decades later, hypothalamic dysfunction was demonstrated to be etiologically involved. In the early nineties, the responsible gene, KAL 1, was cloned and mapped to Xp 22. 3. Kallmann symdrome (KS) is genetically heterogeneous and most cases are sporadic. In about one-third of the affected patients the molecular basis has been identified. Apart from hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and hypo/anosmia, KS may be associated with an array of phenotypic abnormalities. Methods: A 28 -years-old male patient with KS and paranoid schizophrenia was referred to the outpatient clinic for detailed diagnostic evaluation including genetic analysis. The literature was scrutinized for data about psychiatric symptoms in patients with KS. Results: Psychiatric examination disclosed negative psychotic symptoms only, following an acute paranoid schizophrenic episode 1 year before. He used 15 mg aripiprazole daily and testosterone gel 20 mg/gr. Hormonal panel showed extremely low levels of LH and FSH. Otolaryngeal examination disclosed complete anosmia and MRI scanning of the brain demonstrated complete absence of the olfactory bulbs. Neuropsychological assessment revealed subaverage intelligence distinctly disconcordant with premorbid functioning, markedly lowered speed of information processing, and impaired executive and social cognitive functions. Genome wide SNP array analysis and mutation analyses for the KAL 1, FGFR 1, PROK 2, PROKR 2, FGF 8 and CHD 7 genes, disclosed no genetic imbalance or any pathogenic mutation. Conclusion: This is the first report on the co-occurrence of KS and schizophrenia in an adult male patient in whom a complete genetic work-up was performed. Apart from an association between negative psychotic symptoms and odour identification deficits, no other information is available yet about the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in KS. Further clinical studies are warranted to elucidate a possible increased risk for development of psychiatric, particularly psychotic, symptoms in patients with KS...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to provide an {{introduction}} to the work of writer and journalist Harriet Ward, resident in the Eastern Cape from 1842 to 1848. She was a prolific correspondent to various periodicals published both in South Africa and in London. It would be true to say, to judge from the evidence, that she fulfilled a need felt by the British public for information on life and events in South Africa, and that she became the trusted guide of the middle-class reader. Her range covers reports from the frontiers of war, journalistic articles, memoirs, short stories, novels, autobiography, and editions of other writers' work. After the publication of her articles on the Seventh Frontier War (1846 - 7), she was recognised and respected as a commentator on the situation at the Eastern Cape, an unusual role for a woman at this time. She was also amongst the foremost victorian women writers published from the <b>early</b> eighteen <b>forties</b> {{until the end of the}} eighteen-fifties. Harriet Ward has left a vivid historical and sociological account of the Cape frontier, and her observations and judgements provide a hitherto virtually unknown perspective on an important part of South African history and letters. What makes her even more interesting, as this study seeks to show, is that she was far from conventional in her response to her new environment, both as as a woman and as a representative of a colonialist power. The record she has left of her thoughts on the people, landscape and situations of the time has the capacity to surprise the post-colonial literary critic and historian. Her struggle to find a discursive mode in which to express her consciousness of the oppression, patriarchal and colonial, of the marginalised, whether woman, indigene, Afrikaner, or creole, reveals a significantly transgressive or subversive response to the issues of the day. In re-discovering Harriet Ward, we are forced to reassess our assumptions regarding the period of colonial history to which she was a witness. ...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic {{reconnection}} is {{a process}} already known as <b>early</b> as the <b>forties,</b> when Giovannelli first suggested the possibility for the magnetic field to change topology and release energy. This is of primary importance in driving many physical events in space, such as solar flares and geomagnetic substorms, and required further studies. Specifically, the GEM challenge {{turned out to be}} fundamental in explaining reconnective events in the magnetotail. This region is usually well described with the Harris conditions concerning the balance between magnetic and plasma pressures into a symmetric current sheet. However, reality is often strongly asymmetric in either magnetic field or density or both. Only recently this asymmetric configuration has been studied using several different approaches, including MHD and kinetic simulations. Particularly, asymmetric reconnection results in having new interesting hallmarks. For instance, due to the difference of the magnetic energy across the current sheet, a co-location between the X-line and the stagnation point no longer exists. This offset leads to a plasma flow through the null point. Moreover, the X-line may experience a further lateral diamagnetic drift governed by the electron diamagnetic velocity when a proper out-of-plane magnetic component is present (i. e. guide field). Finally, this work aims at going deeper into the abundance of physics behind the process of asymmetric reconnection in collisionless plasmas using a powerful tool as the fully kinetic implicit code iPIC 3 D. This tool allows us to perform simulations with larger spatial and temporal scales thanks to the reduced computational costs of the implicit algorithm. As first application of asymmetric conditions, we are going to analyze the dayside magnetosphere, where the shocked solar wind (magnetosheath) encounters the magnetosphere plasma and strong gradients in both magnetic field and density are measured. Great interest in this region has been lately remarked, mostly in light of the upcoming 4 -satellites cluster NASA mission, named MMS (Magnetosphere Multiscale Mission), devoted to observe reconnection behaviors into these large spatial scale of the magnetosphere. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In an {{appendix}} to {{my paper}} on the lughrana, etc., read before the Society on July 10, I discussed the evidence afforded by the Duterrau engravings. I {{came to the conclusion}} that all the engravings ought to be reversed, because, by the mistake of the engraver, they were transferred on the copper plate as originally drawn. Naturally the prints became rereversed, and the man making the spear appeared to hold the tero-watta in his left and not in his right. Just when the final proof of my paper had been received Mr. Beattie kindly informed me that he had seen the original oil painting, of what I termed No. 1 engraving (PI. XIII.), at the house of the Misses Cleburn, and that this oil painting fully confirmed my conjecture. From the inscription on it we know that the engraving was made in 1835. However, in all probability, it was painted after 1835, perhaps towards the end of the thirties, or <b>early</b> in the <b>forties.</b> Notwithstanding its great shortcomings, the picture is of considerable value as a historical document. It measures about 6 x 4 feet, and on the back is written: "The Reconciliation: Sketch of a national picture measuring 14 X 9 feet. " This "national" picture has actually been painted, but its whereabouts are now unknown. A comparison of the original engraving and the sketch in oil shows marked differences, though on the whole they represent the same arrangement of persons. Both pictures prove that they are compositions, made in the artist's studio, from sketches he made after life, either in Robinson's house, or in his own in Hobart. It is therefore pretty certain that the features are not realistic. The same probably applies to the colour of skin, which in the oil sketch appears to be rather a pleasing dark grey. I do not think that I need to explain the meaning of the picture, which speaks for itself. It is noteworthy, however, that apparently the females are convinced, and ready to accept the new doctrine. The men with one exception only, are either indifferent or directly hostile, attempting to restrain the females. It would be interesting to know whether this conception of the reconciliation arose in the artist's mind only, or whether the females did play the role attributed to them in the oil sketch.

The {{extremely}} steep and technical track seemed almost tailor made for the young Australian. All {{seemed to be going}} well for Hill when he qualified in first place early on race day, besting the second place qualifier by over 14 seconds! Hill was looking confident for Finals. However, with approximately 30 riders left to set off, on arguably the most dangerous course the world cup series has seen in many years, the skies opened up. It had rained every day at this time the whole weekend, but not this hard. Riders who qualified in the top ten, were seen finishing in the late <b>forties,</b> <b>early</b> fifties. When last man to down the track, Hill, set off, no one could believe their eyes. The World Champion at the time was ripping down the track faster than top riders were riding it in the bone dry, perfect conditions. Hill's split time was faster than second place (Steve Peat, who raced in the dry), but a fall later in his run meant the Aussie ended up in a very respectable third position, just 1.63sec off first place rider Matti Lehikoinen, who also completed his final run in the dry. Hill's run will {{go down in history as}} one of the greatest runs in the wet, if not one of the greatest ever. Dan Atherton later quoted [...] "He showed us all that it ain't over, 'till its truly over". Further, eventual winner Matti Lehikoinen stated after the race [...] "I played the tactics (referring to a 20-second pause in his practice run, ensuring a lower qualifying position to avoid any unfavourable weather changes), but Sam is the winner of the day. No questions". Steve Peat said [...] "Sam is the King - give him the crown." [...] Despite his remarkable and certainly unmatched talent for riding in unfavorable conditions, Sam admits that he rarely rides in the rain. In an interview with Steve Jones of Dirt Magazine featured in the film 'Earthed 5: The Law of Fives', when asked if it rained that hard in Australia and if he was used to riding in such conditions Sam replied [...] "I don't even see a raindrop when I'm in Australia".
