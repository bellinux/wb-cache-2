As Moonbase Alpha is located within the impact area, the staff quickly formulates a plan to avert disaster. To guarantee the asteroid's destruction, twelve nuclear charges will be planted at strategic locations. The Eagle task force delivers eleven of the charges as planned. At minus two minutes to detonation, the twelfth, carried by Alan Carter's Eagle One, has yet to be deployed. The ship has developed a malfunction in its main booster and cannot achieve full thrust. To give Carter the time necessary to complete the operation, John Koenig orders the blast delayed. Victor Bergman protests; the timeline must be preserved in order to avoid their being caught in radiation and debris from the explosion. Circumstances worsen when Carter finally arrives at his designated site. After lowering the charge, the release mechanism for the cargo grip jams—the explosive cannot be deployed. Agonising over this latest setback, Koenig informs the astronaut that the charge must remain on site...at any cost. Desperate, Carter shorts the <b>grip</b> <b>mechanism,</b> then manoeuvres his ship until the charge is dislodged. As Eagle One departs at a modest speed, Koenig delays the blast another ten seconds to give the astronaut a fighting chance.|$|R

The microgripper is designed using a topology optimization algorithm based on a spatial filtering technique and considering different penalization coefficients for different material properties during the optimization cycle. The microgripper design has a symmetric monolithic 2 D structure which consists of a complex combination of rigid links integrating both the actuating and <b>gripping</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The numerical simulation is performed by studying the effects of convective heat transfer, thermal boundary conditions at the fixed anchors, and microgripper performance considering temperature-dependent and independent material properties.

The static and dynamic electro-mechanical characteristics are analyzed as step response functions with respect to tweezing/actuating displacements, applied current/power, and actual electric resistance. A microgripper prototype having overall dimensions of 1 mm (L) X 2. 5 mm (W) is able to deliver the maximum tweezing and actuating displacements of 25. 5 mm and 33. 2 mm along X and Y axes, respectively, under an applied power of 2. 32 W.

40|$|Soft {{materials}} have many {{important roles in}} animal locomotion and object manipulation. In robotic applications soft materials can store and release energy, absorb impacts, increase compliance and increase the range of possible shape profiles using minimal actuators. The shape changing ability is also a potential tool to manipulate friction forces caused by contact with the environment. These advantages are accompanied by challenges of soft material actuation {{and the need to}} exploit frictional interactions to generate locomotion. Accordingly, the design of soft robots involves exploitation of continuum properties of soft materials for manipulating frictional interactions that result in robot locomotion. The research presents design and control of a soft body robot that uses its shape change capability for locomotion. The bioinspired (caterpillar) modular robot design is a soft monolithic body which interacts with the environment at discrete contact points (caterpillar prolegs). The deformable body is actuated by muscle-like shape memory alloy coils and the discrete contact points manipulate friction in a binary manner. This novel virtual <b>grip</b> <b>mechanism</b> combines two materials with different coefficients of frictions (sticky-slippery) to control the robot-environment friction interactions. The research also introduces a novel control concept that discretizes the robot-environment-friction interaction into binary states. This facilitates formulation of a control framework that is independent of the specific actuator or soft material properties and can be applied to multi-limbed soft robots. The transitions between individual robot states are assigned a reward that allow optimized state transition control sequences to be calculated. This conceptual framework is extremely versatile and we show how it can be applied to situations in which the robot loses limb function...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} robot able to climb Columns. This robot is not {{dependent}} on the diameter and material of the columns. Some climbing robots have been designed up to now but Koala robot was designed and fabricated for climbing columns exclusively. Simple kinematics of climbing in the nature inspired us to design this robot. We used two linear mechanisms to grip the column. The gripper consists of a DC motor and a power screw mechanism with a linear bushing as a guide. This mechanism provides enough force to grip the column. In addition we needed an actuator for climbing the column; hence, two pneumatic jacks were used. All the mechanical parts were designed according to the exerted forces and operational condition. The prototype can be simply installed and controlled on the column by an inexperienced operator. This robot is intended for inspection and surveillance of pipes in oil industries and power poles in electric industries.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Golfers are used extensively for equipment testing and development, however, they are inconsistent in performance and they tire. Golf swing simulation devices overcome these shortcomings producing consistent repeatable swings and are now intrinsic instruments for golf research conducted by manufacturers governing bodies and academic institutes. The capability of artificial devices to perform human dynamic motions is undoubtedly improving; however, comparatively little scientific effort has been invested {{to ensure that the}} swing motions provided by these mechanical devices are representative of golfers' swings. An extensive 3 D kinematic study of golfers' swings was undertaken to determine joint positions representative of a double pendulum model of the swing along with ball launch and shaft deflection data. A technique for generating golf robot motion commands from the kinematic swing data was then developed using interpolation algorithms to increase the continuity of command derivatives. Six golfers' swings with distinctive swing performance characteristics were replicated using a commercially availablem odem golf robot and a bespokem otion control system. Quantitative data captured from 20 golfers were compared using gender and skill classifications. All golfers were found to perform consistent swing motions and the kinematic sequencing of joint segments supported the summation of speed principle. Higher skill rated golfers were found to perform swings with greater consistency, faster clubhead speeds at impact, faster down swings and greater delayed wrist releases. The research has shown that the new robot control system in conjunction with 3 D kinematic swing data and a feed-forward control enables in dividual golfer's swings to be replicated with both high levels of accuracy and repeatability. The capability for golfers' swings to be replicated accurately using a mechanical device provides new impetus for both clubfitting methodologies and optimisation of swing technique. However, the boundary constraint of the club at the robot's <b>gripping</b> <b>mechanism</b> was found to provide poor representation of golfers' grip, and consequently, the first bending mode of the club was excited during simulations and resultant shaft deflection and ball launch data correlated less well with the golfers' data.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Identifying {{material}} characteristics of composites {{is important in}} designing any structural system. The aerospace industry relies on these material properties not only to design a functional aircraft, but also a safe and reliable one. Since carbon fiber composites are relatively new materials, {{little is known about}} its characteristics under certain loading conditions. The majority of previous research has been dedicated to inplane tension, bending, and shear loading. However, little to no research has been devoted to out-of-plane shear loading (Mode III) of notched panels. This document presents a novel approach to test and analyze panels loaded in Mode III. Literature provided some excellent inspiration for designing a feasible testing method. The proposed method consists of a testing fixture, as well as a testing procedure. One component of the testing fixture includes a hinged <b>grip</b> <b>mechanism</b> to apply load to the panel. The grips are clamped {{on each side of the}} notch and then loaded in opposite directions. The hinge gives the system a rotational degree of freedom and helps eliminate any unwanted damage near the grips. This creates high stress concentrations at the notch tip. To validate this testing method, six different ply layups were analyzed. Each ply layup was tested using six repeated specimens to show consistency between similar panels. The optical method, digital image correlation (DIC), provided a full-field strain measurement of the region of interest every two seconds throughout the test. Specific strain concentrations, secondary strain buildup, and early fracture patterns were extracted from the digital image correlation results. Along with strain patterns, applied load and grip displacement was recorded using the Bluehill® software.
