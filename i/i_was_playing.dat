And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.' I {{found it hard to}} make anything of that. In the end I felt the only thing I could do was to make it as hyper real as I could. I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|E

We usually have Big Jim Wright sit in on those kind of sessions to work out the chords. he wasn't there so I had to work on the chord myself. So <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> and there was a part where I said 'Man, what chord am I supposed to do here?' and Mariah has such a good ear that she sang me the chord.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> good golf, but {{it really}} wasn't {{that big a deal}} to me one way or the other.

So I sort of got myself back to work. So '70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint.... It was a big boost.|$|E
25|$|It was Hofmann. It was, I think, {{his last}} {{performance}} in Toronto, {{and it was}} a staggering impression.

They were all orchestral sounds, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> them all, and suddenly I was Hofmann. I was enchanted.|$|E

500|$|... "People were {{literally}} scared of my records. There {{have been so}} many rumors about me and my records. People got the first album, and they would just make up stories. They'd get into an accident and be like, 'I got into an accident because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> that tape.' It wasn't like we helped ourselves when we described what was in people's heads. It wasn't to shock people, though, but to get people involved in what we were doing. We had to get peoples' attention.

500|$|Parker's {{experience}} {{playing in}} Israel left a positive impression upon him.

And I just had such a great experience that I wanted to take something from that experience. The number 18, in Judaism, it means 'chai'... and it's the symbol for life and good fortune in Judaism. And I thought that was something to take away from Israel and let them know I'm still representing them." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the album}} credits for the {{instruments}} have fanciful names that describe the sound they make. The [...] "Castanet Guitars" [...] are electric guitars played with mallets and are electronically treated to sound something like castanets. The [...] "Leslie piano" [...] is an acoustic piano miked and fed through a Leslie speaker with a built-in revolving horn speaker. Eno described the [...] "snake guitar" [...] and [...] "digital guitar" [...] by stating [...] "the kind of lines <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> {{reminded me of the}} way a snake moves through the brush, a sort of speedy, forceful, liquid quality. Digital guitar is a guitar threaded through a digital delay but fed back on itself a lot so it makes this cardboard tube type of sound." ...|$|E
500|$|Del Potro's {{first half}} of the season was {{hampered}} by injuries and a change of coach, starting with a first-round loss in Adelaide, where he was the seventh seed.

Del Potro returned to the circuit in March, winning his first match against Jesse Levine at the Sony Ericsson Open, before losing in the second round to López. Struggling with injuries, his ranking fell as low as no. 81 in April. [...] "At the start of the year, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> good, but I had many injuries, many problems with my body, with my physique", said del Potro.

500|$|Lucas and {{director}} Richard Marquand cast Scottish Shakespearean actor Ian McDiarmid to play Emperor Palpatine for Return of the Jedi. He {{was in his}} late 30s and had never played a leading role in a feature film, though he had made minor appearances in films like Dragonslayer (1981). After Return of the Jedi, he resumed stage acting in London. In an interview with BackStage, McDiarmid revealed that he [...] "never had his sights set on a film career and never even auditioned for the role of Palpatine." [...] He elaborated, [...] "I got called in for the interview after a Return of the Jedi casting director saw me perform in the Sam Shepard play Seduced at a studio theatre at the Royal Court. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> a dying Howard Hughes." ...|$|E
500|$|John Gielgud's New Theatre {{production}} in 1935 featured Gielgud and Laurence Olivier as Romeo and Mercutio, exchanging roles six {{weeks into the}} run, with Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet. Gielgud used a scholarly combination of Q1 and Q2 texts and organised the set and costumes to match {{as closely as possible}} to the Elizabethan period. His efforts were a huge success at the box office, and set the stage for increased historical realism in later productions. Olivier later compared his performance and Gielgud's: [...] "John, all spiritual, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity... I've always felt that John missed the lower half and that made me go for the other... But whatever it was, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> Romeo I was carrying a torch, I was trying to sell realism in Shakespeare." ...|$|E
500|$|On 18 October, The Sun {{reported}} that McGuire {{had left the}} band. At a reception when Ayers Rock returned to Australia, he said: [...] "The pressure of the tour was just too much. We {{were on the road}} all the time and I guess I wasn't as strong {{as the rest of the}} band. When we got into the studio I had the shakes. I mean <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> the right notes, but not in the right places." [...] To finish the album McGuire's friend Les Young played some of the bass guitar parts, and American Jeff Castleman played bass on [...] "Catchanemu". Young also briefly played live with Ayers Rock in Australia, including an October 1975 show at the State Theatre in Sydney. McGuire returned to the group at the Dallas Brooks Hall on 21 October 1975, to warm applause.|$|E
