5|$|I {{was out of}} favour {{with the}} {{selectors}} because <b>I</b> <b>told</b> one {{to go and get}} effed. I wouldn't play their dicky, dorky games.|$|E
5|$|I now intervened {{to settle}} this dispute, at one moment quite heated. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> the fire-brigade officer on my {{authority}} as Home Secretary {{that the house was}} to be allowed to burn down and that he was to stand by in readiness to prevent the conflagration from spreading.|$|E

50|$|<b>I</b> was <b>told</b> <b>I</b> {{had been}} failed, because I {{had not done}} any work. When I said that I had brought my work in for {{assessment}} {{and that there were}} paintings in my space, <b>I</b> was <b>told</b> that they didn't count as work, because they didn't show development of ideas. I said that my idea was to paint spontaneously and express what I felt. <b>I</b> was <b>told</b> that this was not an acceptable idea in 'contemporary practice'.|$|R
5|$|Jermaine, Manuel and I {{sat down}} and Jermaine {{programmed}} the drums. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him the feel I wanted and Manuel {{put his hands on}} the keyboards and I started singing the melody. We went back and forth with the bridge and the B-section. I had the outline of the lyrics and started singing 'Always be my baby' {{off the top of my}} head.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} ago <b>I</b> <b>told</b> the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E
5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him that I thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E

5|$|I sent MalcolmX {{some rough}} {{chapters}} to read. I was appalled {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, I {{reminded him of his}} previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> {{people the}} {{complete}} opposite. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> them I raised it up 140 volts. I felt so bad. I felt so f—ing horrible, man. They said, “Please don’t attempt what Eddie Van Halen {{said in the}} last interview, because everyone was blowing their amps.” Everyone fried their amps ’cause of me. I felt so bad. I never lied again after that.|$|E

25|$|The confession-book, I suppose, has disappeared. It is {{twenty years}} since I have seen one.

25|$|Anquetil's {{head was}} a computer. It started working: in 500 metres, Poulidor wouldn't get his 56 seconds. I'll never forget what {{happened}} when Jacques crossed the line. Close to fainting, he collapsed {{on the front of}} my car. With barely any breath left, exhausted, but 200 per cent lucid, he asked me: 'How much?' <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him 14 seconds.

25|$|I will, however, {{tell you}} {{just one thing}} about the war, my first story and my last. I was asked by some American friends to search out the grave of their son near Bastogne.

25|$|Worried that {{officials}} might harass the families whose photos {{she had already}} taken, she flashed her press card and exposed the film to the light.
