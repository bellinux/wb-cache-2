40|$|Jason MycoffPresident Obama???s use of {{unilateral}} <b>executive</b> <b>power</b> {{during his}} presidency has evoked fears {{that he is}} becoming an overreaching or imperial president. But presidents for decades have been avid users of <b>executive</b> <b>power,</b> so this thesis discusses whether President Obama???s use of <b>executive</b> <b>power</b> is {{greater than that of}} any other modern president across certain categories. For the purposes of my research I broke <b>executive</b> <b>power</b> into three sections; executive orders, executive privilege, and military action. I chose these categories because of their current newsworthiness, their prominence in presidential history, and because they represent actions initiated directly by the president. I hypothesized that President Obama does not use these powers to an extent much greater than previous presidents, but also no less. I found that overall President Obama is not much different from previous presidents in his use of <b>executive</b> <b>power.</b> However, while his actions are similar to previous presidents, he has carved out areas for future presidents to further expand <b>executive</b> <b>power.</b> Political Scienc...|$|R

50|$|Many {{officers}} possess ordinary power but, due {{to their}} lack of ordinary <b>executive</b> <b>power,</b> are not called ordinaries.

Though the vicar has vicarious ordinary judicial power, {{he is not an}} ordinary because he lacks ordinary <b>executive</b> <b>power.</b> A vicar general, however, has authority through his office to exercise the diocesan bishop's <b>executive</b> <b>power.</b> He is therefore an ordinary because of this vicarious ordinary <b>executive</b> <b>power.</b>|$|R

The growing importance of the civilian bureaucracy and national gentry class during the Song dynasty led to a much more limited role for the emperor in shaping public policy, although he still maintained his autocratic authority.

5|$|Brezhnev {{consolidated}} his {{own position}} over the Government Apparatus by strengthening Podgorny's position as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, literally head of state, {{by giving the}} office some of {{the functions of the}} Premier. The 1977 Soviet Constitution strengthened Podgorny's control of the Council of Ministers, by giving the post of head of state some <b>executive</b> <b>powers.</b> In fact, because of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, the Council of Ministers became subordinate to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. When Podgorny was replaced as head of state in 1977 by Brezhnev, Kosygin's role in day-to-day management of government activities was lessened drastically, through Brezhnev's new-found post. Rumours started circulating within the top circles, and on the streets, that Kosygin would retire due to bad health.|$|E

40|$|According to Article 6 of the Kuwaiti Constitution, ‘The System of Government in Kuwait {{shall be}} democratic, under which {{sovereignty}} {{resides in the}} people, {{the source of all}} powers’. However, the domination of the <b>Executive’s</b> <b>powers</b> is a remarkable feature in Kuwait’s political system. Such uncontrolled powers contradict the basic values of constitutionalism. The main objective of this thesis is to promote a soft-transformation toward constitutionalising the <b>Executive’s</b> <b>powers</b> in Kuwait so as to reflect, more faithfully, the desired ethical values of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and the separation of powers. Parliament and the judiciary have been identified as the most competent mechanisms to undertake the control of <b>executive</b> <b>power</b> in Kuwait. Yet, the constitutional structure of the <b>executive</b> <b>power</b> system and its controlling mechanisms lack the necessary features to apply this control effectively. The hypothesis outlined above was explored by three different methodologies; firstly, by analysing the constitutional structure of the <b>Executive’s</b> <b>power</b> system and measuring it against the ethical values of constitutionalism; secondly, supporting this theoretical approach with fieldwork by interviewing experts; and thirdly, by comparing the control of <b>executive</b> <b>power</b> with the UK’s law and experience in order to utilise a ‘transfer policy’ method. The main findings of the research indicate that the Executive has obtained arbitrary powers that weaken its accountability system. Thus, the study suggests policies to be adopted by Kuwait in order to empower parliament and the judiciary to exercise an effective control over the <b>Executive’s</b> <b>powers.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Conscription for the Army, {{but not for}} {{civilian}} industry, had been brought in {{during the first half}} of 1916. Towards the end of Asquith’s Government in 1916 a Manpower Distribution Board had been set up under Neville’s brother Austen, but it had no <b>executive</b> <b>powers.</b> After Edwin Montagu had refused the new position of Director of National Service, as he thought the task of building up a new ministry was beyond him, Chamberlain, who was already nationally known, was proposed for the job by his brother Austen. In December 1916, the new Prime Minister David Lloyd George offered him the job, with responsibility for co-ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces. Though reluctant to leave his post in Birmingham, Chamberlain accepted and resigned as Lord Mayor.|$|E
5|$|In theory, the emperor's {{political}} power was absolute, but {{even during the}} Han dynasty, he shared <b>executive</b> <b>powers</b> with civilian officials and normally based his decisions on the advice and formal consensus of his ministers. During the Song dynasty, a national examination system (Civil Service Exam) managed by scholar-bureaucrats was used to recruit officials; those who passed the palace examination – the highest-level examination in the empire – were appointed directly by the emperor to the highest central government positions. Like commoners, these senior officials had to obey his edicts as law or be punished. However, senior officials not only challenged the emperor over policy, but restrained him by invoking the ideal Confucian mores {{and values of the}} literati gentry class from which they came.|$|E
5|$|Manila—officially {{known as}} the City of Manila—is the {{national}} capital of the Philippines and is classified as a Special City (according to its income) and a Highly Urbanized City (HUC).

The members of the City Council are elected as representatives of specific congressional districts within the city. The city, however, {{have no control over}} Intramuros and the Manila North Harbor. The historic Walled City is administered by the Intramuros Administration, while the Manila North Harbor is managed by the Philippine Ports Authority. Both are national government agencies.

50|$|A main {{distinction}} between various democratic governments {{is the relationship}} between the legislature and the executive.

50|$|A Directorial System is {{a system}} of {{government}} in which the <b>executive</b> <b>power</b> is split a select number of individual who are, or de facto are, equals. Some have argued that diarchies such as Andorra are directorial as <b>executive</b> <b>power</b> is held between more than one person. Israel's Parliamentary System, a codified, streamlined variant of the Westminster System under which <b>executive</b> <b>power</b> is vested directly in the Multi-person Cabinet, {{as opposed to the}} President acting on the advice of the Cabinet in a normal Westminster System, can be seen as semi-directorial.|$|R
5|$|Other {{difficulties}} arose {{when the}} Empire's parliament, the General Assembly, opened in 1826. PedroI, {{along with a}} significant percentage of the legislature, argued for an independent judiciary, a popularly elected legislature and a government which would be led by the emperor who held broad <b>executive</b> <b>powers</b> and prerogatives. Others in parliament argued for a similar structure, only with a less influential role for the monarch and the legislative branch being dominant in policy and governance. The struggle over whether the government would be dominated by the emperor or by the parliament was carried over into debates from 1826 to 1831 on the establishment of the governmental and political structure. Unable to deal with the problems in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, the Emperor abdicated on behalf of his son, PedroII, on 7 April 1831 and immediately sailed for Europe to restore his daughter to her throne.|$|E
5|$|Singapore's Elected Presidency {{scheme was}} {{created as a}} {{constitutional}} safeguard for the nation's future to prevent irresponsible governance.

However, the President's role is custodial and ceremonial – he does not exercise <b>executive</b> <b>powers.</b> In fact, the President is generally required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet, or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet, in the exercise of his functions under the Constitution or any other written law, unless the contrary is expressly provided for.|$|E
