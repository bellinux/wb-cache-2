5|$|When British troops left Malta in 1979, {{the fort}} was {{abandoned}} and fell <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of disrepair. Parts {{of it were}} also vandalized. At some point it was also used as a desalination plant.|$|E

40|$|Hormone binding {{promotes}} {{conversion of}} rat hepatic insulin receptors from <b>a</b> rapid-dissociating <b>into</b> <b>a</b> slow-dissociating affinity <b>state.</b> Solubilization into detergent does not impair {{the ability of}} receptors to convert <b>into</b> <b>a</b> slow-dissociating <b>state,</b> and this property is retained as receptor-binding activity is enriched 11, 000 - 13, 000 -fold during purification. Hormone binding also induces two conformational changes (alterations of tryptic lability) in the insulin receptor. The first change is rapid and exposes parts of the receptor to tryptic degradation. The second, slower, change occurs with the same time course, and probably mediates the conversion into the slower-dissociating binding state. Reduction of disulphide bonds with dithiothreitol does not prevent conversion of binding sites <b>into</b> <b>a</b> slower-dissociating <b>state,</b> and reduced receptors retain the ability to undergo conformational changes in response to hormone binding. Alkylation with N-ethylmaleimide also {{does not affect the}} insulin-induced conversion <b>into</b> <b>a</b> slow-dissociating <b>state.</b> These observations suggest that the conversion <b>into</b> <b>a</b> slow-dissociating <b>state</b> is <b>an</b> intrinsic property of the insulin receptor. Free thiol groups in the insulin receptor and disulphide bonds between the alpha-subunits are not essential to this process...|$|R

Cardinal Richelieu was given the castle {{to prevent it from}} coming under the control of unfriendly forces, though he allowed it to fall into ruin. Château de Chinon was abandoned until 1793 when, during the Reign of Terror, the castle was temporarily occupied by royalist Vendeans. Soon after, the castle lapsed back into decay.|$|E

In {{an attempt to}} rouse him from this condition, Cardinal Francesco Maria often summoned Gian Gastone to festivities at his villa, Lappeggi.

5|$|PA 563 {{was first}} created in 1928 to connect Bergey to Harrow, {{following}} its current alignment to PA313 before continuing straight along Ridge Road {{and continuing to}} PA412. By 1940, construction of the road <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> highway was completed. In the early 1970s, PA563 was moved to its current alignment north of PA313 {{as a result of}} the creation of Lake Nockamixon, which severed the original alignment.|$|E

5|$|After Congo-Léopoldville gained {{independence}} in 1960, it collapsed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of anarchy within a fortnight. The large Belgian {{population of the}} Congo fled from the violence into neighbouring states, including the federation. Welensky dispatched the Royal Rhodesian Air Force (RRAF) to assist in their evacuation, but was prevented by the British government from entering the Congo itself. Refugees fled by foot to Ndola in Northern Rhodesia, where RRAF planes picked them up and flew them to camps in Salisbury. More than 6,000 people were evacuated by the RRAF.|$|E
5|$|After the Early Neolithic, {{the long}} barrow fell <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of ruined dilapidation, perhaps {{experiencing}} deliberate destruction in the Late Medieval period, either by Christian iconoclasts or treasure hunters. In local folklore, the site became {{associated with the}} burial of a prince and the countless stones motif. The ruin attracted the interest of antiquarians in the 19th century, while archaeological excavation {{took place in the}} early 20th. In 1926, ownership was transferred to heritage charity The National Trust. Open without charge to visitors all year around, the stones are the site of a rag tree, a May Day morris dance, and various modern Pagan rituals.|$|E
5|$|After the Early Neolithic, {{the long}} barrow fell <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of ruined dilapidation, {{with a small}} road being built through {{the centre of the}} {{monument}} by the 19th century at the latest. Local folklore grew up around the site, associating it with the countless stones motif. The ruin attracted the interest of antiquarians in the early 18th century, and was studied by local archaeologists in the 20th. Both it and the nearby Chestnuts Long Barrow are open for public viewing by appointment with the landowner.|$|E

5|$|Angry at his {{treatment}} by the Byers enquiry, Scott sought {{other means of}} pursuing his vendetta against Thorpe. In June 1971 he met Gordon Winter, a South African journalist who was also an agent for the South African intelligence agency BOSS. Scott provided details of his supposed seduction by Thorpe, a story which Winter assured his BOSS masters would destroy Thorpe and the Liberal Party. He found that no newspaper would print the story on largely uncorroborated and unreliable evidence. In March 1972 Scott's friend Gwen Parry-Jones died; Scott used the inquest to denounce Thorpe for ruining his life and driving Parry-Jones to her death. None of these accusations was published. Depressed, Scott retreated <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of torpor, assisted by tranquilisers, {{and for a while}} presented no threat to Thorpe.|$|E
5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (hemorrhagic stroke). Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people went <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. The Palestinian Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E
