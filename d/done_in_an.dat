5|$|All welding of {{tantalum}} must be <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{inert atmosphere}} of argon or helium {{in order to}} shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases. Tantalum is not solderable. Grinding tantalum is difficult, especially so for annealed tantalum. In the annealed condition, tantalum is extremely ductile and can be readily formed as metal sheets.|$|E
5|$|All welding of {{titanium}} must be <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{inert atmosphere}} of argon or helium to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen). Contamination causes {{a variety of}} conditions, such as embrittlement, which reduces {{the integrity of the}} assembly welds and leads to joint failure.|$|E

Some pages are <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> comic layout, {{and others are}} <b>done</b> <b>in</b> novel format. Traditional drawing, inking, coloring, and lettering techniques are used throughout.|$|R

5|$|The film {{received}} favorable reviews by critics. The Morning Telegraph {{said the}} story was too far-fetched to be believable, but it was <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> amusing way. The Moving Picture World stated that the acting and camerawork was satisfactory. The film was advertised in numerous states, sometimes as a comedy, by theaters in Indiana, Kansas, New York, and Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Wallace {{has lost}} caste considerably, {{not only by}} his {{adhesion}} to Spiritualism, but by the fact of his having deliberately and against the whole voice of the committee of his section of the British Association, brought about a discussion on Spiritualism at one of its sectional meetings... This {{he is said to}} have <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> underhanded manner, and I well remember the indignation it gave rise to in the B.A. Council.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, UBS {{expanded}} its global compliance database to include information on {{environmental and social}} issues provided by RepRisk, a global research firm specialized in environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) risk analytics and metrics. This was <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> effort to mitigate environmental and social risks that could impact the bank's reputation or financial performance and to simultaneously help globally standardize and systematically implement the firm's due diligence processes. RepRisk data {{is used in the}} on-boarding process to screen potential new clients and sourcing partners, alongside periodic client reviews and, also, to evaluate the risks related to transactions in investment banking and institutional lending.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Chris Menaul and written by series creator Paul Attanasio. Wilford Brimley made a guest appearance as Harry Prentice, an ill and bed-ridden man who convinces his son to help him kill himself. Attanasio deliberately wrote the script {{so it would be}} morally questionable whether police handling of both the suicide and the police shooting were <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ethically correct way. Pembleton's investigation was based on a real-life investigation into a suspicious shooting featured in David Simon's non-fiction book , on which the Homicide series was based.|$|E
5|$|Two {{populations of}} pallid {{sturgeon}} in the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers of Montana are both {{at risk of}} extinction, and current projections are that wild pallid sturgeon populations in Montana will be extinct by 2018. Though a vigorous stocking effort was implemented in 1996, until pallid sturgeon females reach reproductive maturity sometime after they are 15years of age, recovery efforts in Montana will not be readily measurable. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has been conducting spring pulse water releases from the Tiber Dam every four to fiveyears to try to recreate a semblance of an annual spring flood to restore and rejuvenate downstream floodplains. These pulse releases are <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> effort to restore suitable habitat for numerous fish species.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, Nite Owl and Rorschach {{continue}} {{to uncover the}} conspiracy surrounding the death of The Comedian and the accusations that drove Manhattan into exile. They discover evidence that Veidt may be behind the plan. Rorschach writes his suspicions about Veidt in his journal, {{in which he has}} been recording his entire investigation, and mails it to New Frontiersman, a local right-wing newspaper. The pair then leave New York and confront Veidt at his Antarctic retreat. Veidt explains his underlying plan is to save humanity from impending nuclear war between the United States and Soviet Union by faking an alien invasion in New York City, which will annihilate half the city's population. He hopes this will unite the nations against a perceived common enemy. He also reveals that he had murdered The Comedian, arranged for Dr. Manhattan's past associates to contract cancer, staged the attempt on his own life in order to place himself above suspicion, and killed Moloch in order to frame Rorschach. This was all <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attempt to prevent his plan from being exposed. Nite Owl and Rorschach find Veidt's logic callous and abhorrent, but Veidt has already enacted his plan.|$|E

5|$|The tranomasina were {{destroyed}} in March 1897 by French authorities who removed {{the bodies of}} the sovereigns interred here and relocated them to the royal tombs at the Rova of Antananarivo. The rich collection of funerary objects enclosed within the tombs was also removed for display in the Manjakamiadana palace on the Antananarivo rova grounds, which the Colonial Authority transformed into an ethnological museum. This was <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> effort to desanctify the city of Ambohimanga and break the spirit of the Menalamba resistance fighters who had been rebelling against French colonization for the past year, break popular belief {{in the power of the}} royal ancestors, and relegate Malagasy sovereignty under the Merina rulers to a relic of an unenlightened past. A French garrison was housed within the royal city and military buildings were erected on top of the stone tomb foundations. A kitchen and military canteen were built on top of the tombs of Andrianampoinimerina and Andriamasinavalona. By 1904, the military buildings were likewise demolished, leaving the stone tomb foundations intact.|$|E

25|$|The {{music for}} Broadchurch {{deliberately}} avoided a typical orchestral score. Ã“lafur felt that an orchestra sounded too large and perfect. Music which was intimate and depicted the flawed {{lives of the}} characters was needed, so the score was written for a string quartet and piano, accompanied by electronic sound. Recording, which took just five days, was <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> empty church in Reykjavik.|$|E
6000|$|Another {{point in}} the {{copyright}} essay to which I would ask your attention is rather a feature to be extracted from the whole thing, than from any express declaration of it at any point. It is a general feature of that document, and, indeed, of all of Judge Douglas's discussions of this question, that the Territories of the United States and the States of this Union are exactly alike; {{that there is no}} difference between them at all; that the Constitution applies to the Territories precisely as it does to the States; and that the United States Government, under the Constitution, may not <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> State what it may not <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Territory, and what it must <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> State it must <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Territory.

25|$|Folk {{songs and}} dances are {{essential}} ingredients {{of the traditional}} Naga culture. The oral tradition is kept alive through folk tales and songs. Naga folks songs are both romantic and historical, with songs narrating entire stories of famous ancestors and incidents. There are also seasonal songs which describe activities <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> agricultural season. Tribal dances of the Nagas give an insight into the inborn Naga reticence of the people. War dances and other dances belonging to distinctive Naga tribes are a major art form in Nagaland.|$|E

This slip often had mineral pigments added for color, which could be added before and/or after firing. Firing was <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> open fire or in a pit. Figurines were often done in the family hearth. Pots were fired in a heap placed {{on the ground or}} in a pit and covered with wood. The use of this method for firing most often led to incompletely fired pots, with the notable exception of Fine Orangeware.|$|E
