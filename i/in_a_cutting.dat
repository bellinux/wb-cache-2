5|$|An Anglo-Saxon {{spearhead}} {{was found}} in July 1962 by D. Tamkin <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> through a natural knoll of sand on Messrs Reed's playing fields at Cobdown, Ditton.

5|$|In 1910 the new Bicester {{cut-off line}} of the Great Western Railway Chiltern Main Line was routed {{directly}} through Wood Siding, but no interchange station was built. The GWR was to run <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> beneath the existing station; Wood Siding station and its siding were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908 and 1910 to stand on a wide bridge above the GWR's line.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 the new Bicester {{cut-off line}} of the GWR Chiltern Main Line opened, {{allowing}} trains from London to Birmingham to bypass a long curve through Oxford. The new line was routed directly through Wood Siding, although no interchange station was built. The GWR ran <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> beneath the existing station; Wood Siding station and its siding were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908–1910 to stand on a wide bridge above the GWR's line. The new line included the station named Brill and Ludgershall, which in reality was considerably further from Brill than the existing Brill station.|$|E

5|$|The {{station has}} two {{platforms}} positioned <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> partially {{covered with a}} glazed roof and partially exposed to the atmosphere. It was designed by John Fowler the MR's chief engineer. The brick-built street-level entrance building featured a balustrade {{along the edge of}} the roof decoratively topped with urns. Fowler's building was demolished and reconstructed to a design by the MR's architect Charles W Clark in 1914 with a cladding of white faïence blocks. The building is listed Grade II by Historic England. The brickwork of the platform retaining walls was restored in 1986 during a renovation of the station.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{the down}} became {{the site of}} a major road protest against the {{completion}} of a section of the M3 motorway from London to the south coast of England. There had been plans since the 1970s to replace an earlier 1930s-built bypass of Winchester, which became regularly congested due to design features that had become out of date. This became problematic {{due to the lack of}} available land between Winchester College and St. Catherine's Hill. After several public inquiries, particularly with problems using the water meadows near the college, a route was chosen that took the motorway over the down, ultimately <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting.</b> Although protesting against the M3 had been ongoing since the early 1970s, the protest-action on top of the down, described in 1994 as the most controversial British motorway project ever to start construction, attracted a wider group of classes of people than had previously been the case, and included physical violence from onsite security officers.|$|E
5|$|In the 1967/68 season, John left Llanelli {{and joined}} Cardiff, where he formed a {{partnership}} with Gareth Edwards. Although John and Edwards later became the scourge of New Zealand, their first international pairing had an inauspicious start. On 11 November 1967, the pair played their first international together, facing Brian Lochore's touring New Zealand team. Edwards, like John, had two international games to his name, paired with Watkins {{in the final two}} matches of the 1967 Five Nations Championship. John regained his international place after Watkins had switched to professional rugby league just the month before, joining Salford for a club record fee of £16,000. Wales had an error-strewn game, in a match played <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting,</b> rain-laden wind which turned the pitch into a muddy field. Wales captain Norman Gale won the toss and chose to play the first half into the gale, and finished the half 8–0 down. John raised Welsh hopes with an early dropped goal, his first international points, but a panicked blind back pass from Wales' number8, John Jeffery, gifted Bill Davies an easy try. The game ended 13–6 to New Zealand, with Edwards looking uncomfortable throughout, and John's kicking inaccurate, there was little to suggest the pair would become one of the great half-back pairings in rugby history.|$|E

25|$|At {{the eastern}} end of the station was the Devils Toenail Junction, where the line forked to Harrogate or Church Fenton making up one corner of the {{triangular}} junction.

25|$|Fish Market {{is located}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting,</b> {{adjacent}} to the Western Distributor in Pyrmont. It serves a mixed employment and medium density residential area, and the nearby Sydney Fish Market. A redevelopment of the fish market was announced in November 2016. The market will move from its current location to an adjacent site that will put it closer to the Wentworth Park stop.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} and ticket office are at street level, at {{which there is}} a footbridge to the bus station and a taxi rank. A walkway leads to the platforms which are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting.</b> The main island platform has a buffet. The original main station building was demolished in the 1980s, but the Victorian buildings survive on the platforms. The clock tower was dismantled and rebuilt next to the new station.|$|E

25|$|In 1839 {{the coach}} road was {{replaced}} by a new turnpike road, the Wakefield and Austerlands Toll Road. Trenches were cut in the coach road, to prevent it being used as a free alternative. This route is used today by the A62 road, crossing the summit of Standedge <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting.</b> The M62 motorway now carries most cross-Pennine road traffic on a different route to the north of Standedge.|$|E
25|$|At Bow Road, the {{junction}} with the A11 involves a triple-layer junction, Bow Interchange. The ECR passes through <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> below an interchange roundabout whilst the A11 passes above on a flyover. South of this junction, the ECR passes Bromley-by-Bow station and skirts the River Lee Navigation {{for a short}} distance as it follows {{the line of the}} former St Leonard Street. It then crosses Limehouse Cut and continues along what was Brunswick Road to East India Dock Road (A13). It passes under the A13 in another grade separated junction, becoming the A102, and then enters the Blackwall tunnel.|$|E

25|$|Makrellbekken and the {{surroundings}} neighborhoods were opened for housing construction during the 1920s. This caught {{the interest of}} Akersbanerne, who had built the Røa Line (then known as the Smestad Line) along Sørkedalsveien to Smestad in 1912. Makrellbekken initially proposed an extension to Makrellbekken and received permission for this on 26 May 1933. A major controversy {{was related to the}} line crossing Sørkedalsveien. Many motorists and local residents feared that a level crossing would be hazardous. At Smestad the line had to be built <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> to pass under Ullernchauséen. This approach was not chosen at Makrellbakken.|$|E
25|$|On 17 July 1808 Napier {{took two}} boats from Pultusk {{to join the}} three boats from Fawn <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> out {{expedition}} on the NE end of Port Rico. Lieutenant James Robertson, First Lieutenant of Fawn, was in charge, although Napier outranked Robertson. Napier was only accompanying Robertson to gain {{a knowledge of the}} coast and agreed that he would have the status of a volunteer, and that Robertson would be responsible for the operation. The British cut out a Spanish merchant schooner from under the guns of two batteries, and then Robertson and Napier landed and spiked the guns in one battery and rendered the guns' carriages unusable.|$|E
25|$|After {{passing through}} Aldgate station, the {{terminus}} of the Metropolitan line, the line joins the District line shortly before Tower Hill; {{this part of}} the line includes stations on the Victoria Embankment, on the north bank of the Thames, as far as Westminster station. West of Gloucester Road station the line turns off the District main line to join the District line's Edgware Road branch just before High Street Kensington station. In Bayswater the line is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting,</b> concealed from above by a façade of two five-storey houses at Nos. 23 and 24 Leinster Gardens. Trains then call at the second Paddington station on Praed Street before rejoining the Hammersmith & City line at Praed Street junction and terminating at the four-platform Edgware Road station.|$|E
