5|$|Although very popular, few prints <b>have</b> <b>survived</b> and {{impressions}} of the first edition are very rare. A fine example was sold at Christie's New York in 2013 for $866,500, setting a new auction record for the artist.|$|E

5|$|Many {{hundreds}} of smaller {{members of the}} family, some only a few meters across, have been discovered since {{the launch of the}} SOHO satellite in 1995. None of these smaller comets <b>have</b> <b>survived</b> its perihelion passage. Larger sungrazers such as the Great Comet of 1843 and C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) <b>have</b> <b>survived</b> their perihelion passage. Amateur astronomers have been successful at discovering Kreutz comets in the data available in real time via the Internet.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} Malagasy {{hippopotamus}} (also known as Malagasy dwarf hippopotamus or Malagasy pygmy hippopotamus or Madagascan instead of Malagasy) {{lived on the}} island of Madagascar but are now believed to be extinct. The animals were very similar to the extant hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus. The fossil record suggests that at least one species of hippopotamus lived until about 1,000 years ago, and other evidence suggests that the species may <b>have</b> <b>survived</b> until much more recently. The taxonomy of these animals is not resolved and not widely studied. The various species are believed to <b>have</b> <b>survived</b> into the Holocene era.|$|E
