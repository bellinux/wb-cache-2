5|$|The {{commander}} of the Bastille {{at the time was}} Bernard-René de Launay, a conscientious but minor military officer. Tensions surrounding the Bastille had been rising for several weeks. Only eight prisoners remained in the fortress, but one of these, the Marquis de Sade, had stoked the link between the revolution and the Bastille, addressing the public from his walks on top of the towers and, once this was forbidden, shouting from the window of his cell. Sade began to claim that the authorities planned to massacre the prisoners in the castle, which resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> removing him to an alternative site in early July.|$|E

The Premier then recommends the appointment of other Members of the two Houses to the Ministry, under the principle of responsible or Westminster government. It should be noted, however, that as in other Westminster systems, there is no constitutional requirement in NSW for the Government to be formed from the Parliament—merely convention. The Premier is Gladys Berejiklian of the Liberal Party.|$|E
25|$|The Cabinet in June 1978 {{put forward}} the {{constitutional}} amendment Bill C-60, that, amongst other changes, vested executive authority directly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> general and renamed the position as First Canadian, but the proposal was thwarted by the provincial premiers. When the constitution was patriated four years later, the new amending formula for the documents outlined that any changes to the Crown, including the Office of the Governor General, would require the consent of all the provincial legislatures plus the federal parliament. By 1984, Canada's first female governor general—Jeanne Sauvé—was appointed. While {{it was she who}} created the Canadian Heraldic Authority, as permitted by letters patent from Queen Elizabeth II, and who championed youth and world peace, Sauvé proved to be a controversial vicereine, closing to the public the grounds of the Queen's residence and self-aggrandizingly breaching protocol on a number of occasions.|$|E

Additionally, 47% of respondents thought that Harper's Conservative government would better manage the financial crunch, versus 34% in support of the Dion-led coalition.

25|$|Previously named Oscar, {{he was the}} ship's cat of the German {{battleship}} Bismarck. When she was sunk on 27 May 1941, only 116 out of a crew of over 2,200 survived. Oscar {{was picked}} up by the destroyer HMS Cossack (ironically one of the ships responsible for destroying Bismarck). Cossack herself was torpedoed and sunk a few months later, on 24 October, killing 159 of her crew, but Oscar again survived to be rescued, and was taken to Gibraltar. He became the ship's cat of HMS Ark Royal, which was torpedoed and sunk in November that year. Oscar was again rescued, but it was decided at that time to transfer him to a home on land. By now known as Unsinkable Sam because of surviving the three sinking-ships, he was given a new job as mouse-catcher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> General's of Gibraltar office buildings.

Three Australian destroyers also took part in the invasion of Madagascar in September 1942.

2500|$|Norfolk Island was {{the subject}} of several {{experiments}} in administration during the century. It began the nineteenth century as part of the Colony of New South Wales. On 29 September 1844, Norfolk Island was transferred from of the Colony of New South Wales to the Colony of Van Diemen's Land. On 1 November 1856 Norfolk Island was separated from the Colony of Tasmania (formerly Van Diemen's Land) and constituted as a [...] "distinct and separate Settlement, the affairs of which should until further Order in that behalf by Her Majesty be administered by a Governor to be for that purpose appointed". The Governor of New South Wales was constituted as the Governor of Norfolk Island. On 19 March 1897 the office of the Governor of Norfolk Island was abolished and responsibility for the administration of Norfolk Island was vested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> of the Colony of New South Wales. Yet, the island was not made a part of New South Wales and remained separate.

2500|$|Initially, {{decisions}} of the Supreme Court could be appealed to the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council. [...] As well, litigants could appeal directly from the provincial courts of appeal directly to the Judicial Committee, by-passing the Supreme Court entirely. There was {{a provision in the}} 1875 Act which attempted to limit appeals to the Judicial Committee. That clause resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> General reserving the bill for consideration by the Queen-in-Council. After much debate between Canadian and British officials, royal assent was granted on the understanding the clause did not in fact affect the royal prerogative to hear appeals, exercised through the Judicial Committee. The question of the power of Parliament to abolish appeals to the Judicial Committee eventually was tested in the courts. [...] In 1926, the Judicial Committee ruled that the Canadian Parliament lacked the jurisdiction to extinguish appeals to the Judicial Committee, as the right of appeal was founded in the royal prerogative and could only be terminated by the Imperial Parliament. [...] Following the enactment of the Statute of Westminster, in 1933 the federal Parliament passed legislation again abolishing the right of appeal in criminal matters. [...] In 1935, the Judicial Committee upheld the constitutional validity of that amendment. [...] In 1939, the federal government proposed a reference to the Supreme Court of Canada, asking whether the federal Parliament could terminate all appeals to the Judicial Committee. By a 4–2 decision, the Supreme Court held that the proposal was within the powers of the federal Parliament and would be constitutional. [...] The question was then appealed to the Judicial Committee, but the hearing of the appeal was delayed by the outbreak of World War II. [...] in 1946, the Judicial Committee finally heard the appeal and upheld the decision {{of the majority of the}} Supreme Court, clearing the way for Parliament to enact legislation to end all appeals to the Judicial Committee, whether from the Supreme Court or from the provincial courts of appeal. In 1949, Parliament passed an amendment to the Supreme Court Act which abolished all appeals, making the Court truly the Supreme Court. [...] However, cases which had been instituted in the lower courts prior to the amendment could still be appealed to the Judicial Committee. The last Canadian appeal to the Judicial Committee was not decided until 1960.|$|E
2500|$|Santiago emerged the {{political}} scenario {{prior to the}} 2000 general elections, running for the mayorship of his native Comerío representing the Partido Popular Democratico. He won this bid with 6,232 votes or 50%, defeating his opponents, the incumbent Luis Rivera Rivera (Partido Nuevo Progresista; 5,832 or 46.8%) and Carlos Colón Márquez (Partido Independentista Puertorriqueño; 297 or 2.4%). Comerío's general political base supported the PNP's candidate for governor in these elections, but Santiago managed to attract enough new voters for the PPD base to grow in 13% during {{the first years of}} his administration. This was combined with a 3% reduction in the PNP affiliates that voted for that party's candidate for mayor, an estimated 2% voted for the PPD in this ballot. During this term, he also represented the mayors in the administrative structure of the Programa de Comunidades Especiales, a government program that aimed to reduce the poverty rate. On November 6, 2004, Santiago was elected for a second term (6,276 votes or 50.51%) [...] defeating challengers Miguel Rivera, Jr. (PNP; 5,887 or 47.38%) and Aida Luz Cruz Bermúdez (PIP; 204 or 1.64%). In these general elections, the PNP was once again favored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> ballot, but the PPD was supported by voters from both parties in the mayorship ballot. Santiago won a third consecutive time at the 2008 general election by receiving 6,962 votes or 56.3%, defeating Randy Reyes Pimentel (PNP; 5,158 or 41.7%) and Luis Rivera Márquez (PIP; 174 or 1.4%). This represented an improvement of 11% when compared to 2004. On March 12, 2010, Santiago assumed the interim presidency of the Asociación de Alcaldes de Puerto Rico (AAPR), vacated by soberanista leader William Miranda Marín, who was suffering from pancreatic cancer. [...] He was subsequently supported by his peers to take charge of the office officially, being sworn in by Miranda Marín himself. His staff was completed by Pedro García, mayor of Hormigueros, Puerto Rico, as first vice president; Jorge Márquez, mayor of Maunabo, Puerto Rico, as second vice president and Heriberto Vélez, mayor of Quebradillas, Puerto Rico as secretary. Santiago had already served as secretary for the organization and was the acting vice president. Santiago is the official representative of the mayors at the party's committee, the Junta de Gobierno del PPD.|$|E
