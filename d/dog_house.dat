40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to compare the apparent digestibility coefficients of a commercial dog food, fecal consistency and behavior of <b>dogs</b> <b>housed</b> in kennels and metabolic cages. Six adult Beagle dogs were distributed in cross-over experimental design, with six replicates per treatment. <b>Dogs</b> were <b>housed</b> in two environments: metabolic cages and in masonry kennels with solarium. Dogs were fed for a five-day adaptation period, and the five following days were used for total feces collection. Dogs behavior was recorded during a 48 -h period, with 10 -min intervals. Apparent digestibility coefficients were not different between treatments. However, <b>dogs</b> <b>housed</b> in metabolic cages produced lower weight and more consistent feces as compared with <b>dogs</b> <b>housed</b> in kennels. <b>Dogs</b> spent most of the time sleeping in both <b>housing</b> systems; however, <b>dogs</b> <b>housed</b> in the metabolic cages slept more than those in kennels. Stress-related behaviors (barking, whimpering, stereotypies, etc) were observed for no longer than 15 minutes per day, and were not different between dogs in kennels or in cages. There is no difference in food digestibility evaluated in <b>dogs</b> <b>housed</b> in metabolic cages or kennels; however, dogs kept in metabolic cages eliminate drier feces and spend more time inactive than those kept in kennels...|$|R

The A-35 was the only Soviet ABM system allowed under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. In development since the 1960s and in operation from 1971 until the 1990s, it featured the nuclear-tipped A350 exoatmospheric interceptor missile.

500|$|Gus finds Cavanaugh's lunch, and {{believes}} that it is poisoned due to its unusual smell. Shawn takes it to his father, Henry Spencer (Corbin Bernsen), to have it analyzed. Henry demands that in return, Shawn must build a <b>dog</b> <b>house</b> he promised to make in 1989. Shawn agrees, and leaves. While riding back to the office, he is run off the road by a mysterious van. Shawn wakes up in the hospital, and after he gets out, Gus informs him that he discovered another fake inhaler. Shawn returns to Henry's house to finish the <b>dog</b> <b>house.</b> Henry confirms that the lunch was poisoned, and Shawn returns to the bee. He disguises himself as the new spellmaster in order to enter the booth, and discovers that Cavanaugh had found out that Miklous Prochazka (Richard Zeman) was helping his son (Alexander Calvert), a contestant in the bee, to cheat by spelling out his son's words to him in Morse code using electrical impulses that were transferred to his false inhaler. After the bee has finished, Shawn has a [...] "psychic vision" [...] where he reveals everything to the police, who arrest Miklous and his son.|$|E

40|$|Nine male beagle <b>dogs,</b> <b>housed</b> {{in either}} a {{conventional}} or locked environment for 2. 5 years, were killed, and the bacterial flora present in various regions of each gastrointestinal tract was assessed by culture techniques, light microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. All dogs possessed a complex microflora in their colons; in almost every dog anaerobes predominated. The highest number of bacteria cultured was 1010 /g (dry weight) of tissue and contents; highest counts obtained with a Petroff-Hauser counting chamber were 1010 /ml (wet weight). Although there was a consistency in the detectable genera, there were also noticeable differences in the flora of <b>dogs</b> <b>housed</b> under different environmental conditions. These differences included qualitative and quantitative changes in the flora as well as alterations in the distribution and localization of microorganisms along the gastrointestinal tract and in the crypts of Lieberkuhn. No bacterial layers were detected on the surfaces of stomach or proximal bowel {{in any of the}} <b>dogs.</b> <b>Dogs</b> <b>housed</b> in a conventional, open, environment had bacteria that occurred in layers on their ceca and colons and in their crypts of Lieberkuhn; however, <b>dogs</b> <b>housed</b> under “locked” environmental conditions did not possess them or had them less frequently. Dogs removed from the locked environment and kept (30 days) in conventional housing conditions were the only ones with detectable segmented filamentous microbes in their ilea. This study shows that the microbial flora does not simplify when <b>dogs</b> are <b>housed</b> in a locked environment. Indeed, it may increase in complexity and cause alterations in the bacterial flora that is associated closely with gastrointestinal epithelial cells and crypts of Lieberkuhn...|$|R

Bart, as Woodrow, writes Edna other letters, using dialogue from old romance films {{to tell her what}} she wants to hear. He then sends a letter asking for them to meet at the Gilded Truffle restaurant. Bart sees Edna waiting for Woodrow, and laughs as he goes to watch a movie. When he comes back and sees Edna still at the restaurant on the verge of tears, Bart is upset and guilty to see her crying. Meanwhile, Homer resists temptations to curse but nevertheless experiences intense feelings of rage.

On March 5, 1997 he gave a radio interview with The <b>Dog</b> <b>House</b> on KYLD in San Francisco. In the interview he stated that he had hired security since he feared for his safety; this {{was because he was}} a celebrity figure in general, not because he was a rapper. Life After Death was scheduled for release on March 25, 1997. On January 8, 1997, Biggie Smalls and Sean [...] "Puffy" [...] Combs made a video for the song [...] "What's Beef", directed by Dave Meyers. On March 8, 1997, he presented an award to Toni Braxton at the 11th Annual Soul Train Music Awards in Los Angeles and was booed by some of the audience. After the ceremony, Wallace attended an after party hosted by Vibe magazine and Qwest Records at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles.

500|$|The final segment, [...] "It's the Grand Pumpkin, Milhouse" [...] is {{a parody}} of It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (and was {{supposed}} to be named [...] "It's The Great Pumpkin, Milhouse," [...] but due to legal reasons, was renamed) and contains several references to the Peanuts series. In the segment, Milhouse wears the same clothes and plays the same role as Linus van Pelt. Lisa is modelled after Sally Brown and Bart looks like Charlie Brown; he even says [...] "good grief", echoing Charlie Brown's catchphrase. The main theme to Peanuts [...] "Linus and Lucy" [...] is played several times. A redesigned version of Santa's Little Helper can be seen sleeping on top of his <b>dog</b> <b>house</b> and Homer is seen sleeping on top of his house {{in a manner similar to}} Snoopy. When Marge first speaks, she uses a muted trombone. This is {{a parody of}} the [...] "wah wah wah" [...] voice that is used for adults in the various Peanuts specials. At the end of the segment, she says to the audience that they can send complaints to an address which she only says in more muted trombone noises. Milhouse' prayer to the Grand Pumpkin is similar to the Nicene Creed. The dance scene during the Halloween party is a parody of the dance scene in A Charlie Brown Christmas right down to Kang and Kodos in a nonspeaking cameo as the twins 3 and 4.|$|E

The neighbor's dog, Shep comes out of his <b>dog</b> <b>house</b> and barks, and Baby Helen rises with a joyful expression. She takes a piece of a muffin and tosses it through the boxwood hedge separating the two yards. Shep eats the muffin and Helen invites him to her tea party. Shep runs along the hedge and passes through to join her. Helen instructs Shep with her finger and Shep barks in understanding, Helen takes her seat and shares a muffin with Shep. An inter-title announces that a week later, Helen is out on an errand. Helen passes through the hedge and skips down the sidewalk and Shep barks at her. As Helen crosses the street, she is struck by a passing automobile and Shep races to the rescue. He tugs at her dress at the waist and finding that he is unable to move her, runs to Helen's home and jumps against the screen door, barking repeatedly. As Helen's parents are summoned, Shep leads them to Helen, where a passerby has scooped up Helen {{from the middle of the}} street. All three depart and the scene changes to a dimly lit room with Helen laid on a bed, seemingly dead. Her parents watch over her, with sad faces as a doctor inspects her and folds her arms across her chest. Beyond saving, her parents bury their heads in the pillow next to Helen as the doctor pens a note. Then Shep is shown resting against the side of the door in a feeble and sorrowful looking position.|$|E
