The challenge for the Member States is to put the funds made available by these instruments to productive use in order to support sustainable jobs and growth in Europe.

The authors explore the recent developments in the EU-China investments, trade cooperation and the challenges of the ever-growing CEEC-China partnership in different formats, including the new platform of 16 + 1. The authors examine these implications in relation to the need to expand and adapt the content and approach of the EU-China Bilateral Investment agreement. The article concludes that the CEEC-China relation does not go against the EU; moreover, neither the CEE countries nor China have any motivation to try to weaken the EU...|$|E

The public investment push is assessed in normal times and starting from the zero lower bound, making different hypotheses on private investment leverage and on capital productivity. Then, in order to assess the effectiveness of the Juncker plan, we compare it with the stimulus plan implemented by the Obama administration in 2009.

40|$|The European Commission’s <b>Investment</b> <b>Plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>Europe</b> and the {{enduring}} economic crisis has brought state-owned development banks {{again to the}} fore of public and scholarly debate in Europe. This article proposes to place these banks’ activities and recent institutional co-operation {{in the context of}} European integration and assumes a historical perspective on European economic governance and development banking. Most importantly, it argues that the European Investment Bank has become a centre of gravity in long-standing political attempts to increase the investment firepower of the European Union. Based on detailed process-tracing analysis through publicly available data and interview material, the article delineates a gradual process of institutional innovation and network formation that advanced since the late 1980 s and culminated in recent post-crisis policy processes. The contemporary visibility of development banking in Europe, we conclude, follows from these and is representative of a nucleus for a – somewhat hidden – European investment state, whose reach and stability, however, is yet to be determined...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} master´s {{thesis is}} to analyse and define the political-economic {{ideology}} followed by the European Union as well as look at its potential transformation after the global financial crisis, especially {{with the introduction of}} the Juncker plan. In this regard, the research draws attention primarily to European Union´s investment strategy and youth unemployment as the two variables contributing to the delimitation of the theoretical paradigm from which the European Union emanates. The study first introduces two theoretical concepts that are most relevant for characterising European Union´s behaviour, which according to the existing literature are modern-Keynesianism and neoliberalism. These, after the analysis of the constellation of the European Social Fund and the European Investment Bank, answer the question which political-economic paradigm is more consistent with the present European Union´s set-up and thus help us to derive what the currently followed ideology is. Ultimately, attention is then drawn to the Juncker plan determining whether the new <b>investment</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>Europe</b> brings a change not only from the policy perspective but also from the ideological point of view...|$|E

40|$|The {{economic}} development of the European Union is hampered by insufficient private and public long-term investments. This weakness {{is seen as a}} rationale for state intervention, and numerous projects are discussed and implemented {{to find new ways to}} mobilize private capital for long-term investments. Examples are the <b>Investment</b> <b>Plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>Europe,</b> the EU Project Bond Initiative, the Capital Markets Union, or, on a national level, the investment plan of a commission appointed by the German Federal Minister of Economic Affairs. For an economic evaluation of this policy approach, the following paper concentrates on the proposal of a targeted European savings account in the European Commission 2 ̆ 019 s Green Paper 2 ̆ 01 cLong term financing of the European economy 2 ̆ 01 d from March 2013. The first result is that the rationale for state intervention stands on a weaker basis than it seems: We fail to establish a dependable link between the ongoing depression of long-term investments in some European countries and a market failure in the market for the financing of such investments. Investment capital is abundant. Public long-term investments are restrained due to political priorities in favor of short-term consumption, and private long-term investment suffers from the weakness of the real economy and an adverse political environment. Secondly, the state can only imperfectly perform the tasks of a financial intermediary, i. e., delegated monitoring, liquidity provision and delegated contracting. In particular, it cannot enter into the specific long-term relationships that are important for the financing of SMEs at least in some European countries. Thus, functioning and valuable credit relationships might get crowded out by a statesponsored credit business of inferior economic value. Both the costs of the subsidy and the potential losses from increased credit risk would have to be covered by the tax payers. The fact that the targeted European savings account and similar approaches like the 2 ̆ 01 ccitizens 2 ̆ 019 fund 2 ̆ 01 d as a component of the German investment plan intend to mobilize retail investors 2 ̆ 019 money creates special concerns. Such subsidized accounts would crowd out the common bank deposits and thereby weaken the stability of the refinancing base of retail banks. Risk discipline is reduced, and the likelihood of panic runs increases. Overall, this could lead to a significant increase of systemic risk...|$|E
