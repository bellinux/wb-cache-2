40|$|In {{this study}} we examine the impacts of <b>expansionary</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> {{executed}} by the Federal Reserve on poverty in the United States of America. It has been discussed in various studies that the Fed’s <b>expansionary</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> create a less positive impact on {{economy as a whole}} than financial sector. In this study, the expansionary effects of expansionary policies on the poor living in America will be discussed. The main thesis of the study is that the poor living in the United States benefited less from <b>expansionary</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> than either financial sector or the US economy as a whole. When discussing the thesis of the study both employed and unemployed poor will be discussed. Therefore, it will be questioned that the decrease in the unemployment rate is the indicator of the fight against poverty. Indicators such as indices and interest rates in the financial markets, and indicators such as growth rates and unemployment rates in the overall economy are regarded as essential indicators but as for poverty it’s hard to find such regarded indicators. Unfortunately, there are not too many statistics about the poor living in the United States in the reports of the international organizations. Thus the main trouble of the study is that international comparisons are almost impossible. Therefore, various indicators produced by the U. S. government agencies of various indicators will be used in this study...|$|R

25|$|Under {{the gold}} standard, the United States kept the Dollar {{convertible}} to gold. The Federal Reserve {{would have had}} to execute an <b>expansionary</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> to fight the deflation and to inject liquidity into the banking system to prevent it from crumbling—but lower interest rates would have led to a gold outflow. Under the gold standards price–specie flow mechanism countries that lost gold but nevertheless wanted to maintain the gold standard had to permit their money supply to decrease and the domestic price level to decline (deflation). As long as the Federal Reserve had to defend the gold parity of the Dollar it had to sit idle while the banking system crumbled.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{the wider}} economy, Canada was {{surprisingly}} unhurt by these events. While growth slowed, the economy never actually entered a recession. This {{was the first time}} that Canada had avoided following the United States into an economic downturn. The rate of job creation in Canada continued at the rapid pace of the 1990s. A number of explanations have been advanced to explain this. Canada was not as directly affected by 9/11 and the subsequent wars, and the downward pressure of these events was more muted. Canada's fiscal management during the period has been praised as the federal government continued to bring in large surpluses throughout this period, in sharp contrast to the United States. Unlike the United States no major tax cuts or major new expenditures were introduced. However, during this time, Canada did pursue an <b>expansionary</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> in an effort to reduce the effects of a possible recession. Many provincial governments suffered greater problems with a number of them returning to deficits, which was blamed on the fiscal imbalance. 2003 saw elections in six Canadian provinces and in only one did the governing party not lose seats.|$|E
500|$|The Phillips curve {{appeared}} {{to reflect a}} clear, inverse relationship between inflation and output. The curve broke down in the 1970s as economies suffered simultaneous economic stagnation and inflation known as stagflation. The empirical implosion of the Phillips curve followed attacks mounted on theoretical grounds by Friedman and Edmund Phelps. Phelps, although not a monetarist, argued that only unexpected inflation or deflation impacted employment. Variations of Phelps's [...] "expectations-augmented Phillips curve" [...] became standard tools. Friedman and Phelps used models with no long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. Instead of the Phillips curve they used models based on the natural rate of unemployment where <b>expansionary</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> can only temporarily shift unemployment below the natural rate. Eventually, firms will adjust their prices and wages for inflation based on real factors, ignoring nominal changes from monetary policy. The expansionary boost will be wiped out.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I examine the equity market {{reactions}} to the European Central Bank's (ECB) <b>expansionary</b> unconventional <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> announcements between 1. 11. 2008 and 31. 10. 2015, using firm-level data from German markets. Exploiting the firm-level data and different measures for financial constraints allows me to sort companies into different portfolios. Hence, I am able to draw more precise conclusions about the equity market reactions and the feasibility of ECB's <b>expansionary</b> unconventional <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> compared to previous studies, which have mainly focused on an index-level reactions, especially after the global financial crisis. The broad approach in this thesis is that I build upon the existing literature of conventional <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> and study, whether the same hypotheses and causalities documented before the global financial crisis and with the conventional <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> also apply {{in the aftermath of}} financial crisis and with the unconventional <b>monetary</b> <b>policies.</b> More specifically, I hypothesize that the average equity market reaction to the ECB's <b>expansionary</b> unconventional <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> announcements is positive, financially constrained firms' stock returns after the ECB's <b>expansionary</b> unconventional <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> announcements are higher than relatively unconstrained firms', and different industries respond in a heterogeneous way to the ECB's <b>expansionary</b> unconventional <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> announcements. First, I find that the average equity market reaction to the ECB's 12 unconventional <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> announcements measured by the DAX index returns amounts to 1. 52 %. Moreover, only one announcement day was associated with the negative equity market reaction and the firm-level data show that all the portfolios have yielded positive returns, both on the announcement day and the one day longer time window. Second, by using the firm-level data and sorting firms into different portfolios based on the level of financial constraints, I find two-sided results. The results of various tests and five financial constraint measures show clearly that the immediate price reaction of the most financially constrained firms to the ECB's <b>expansionary</b> unconventional <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> announcements has been lower than relatively unconstrained firms', which differ from the findings of prior literature. However, with longer time window (- 5, 5) the cumulative average returns of the financially constrained firms are larger than the unconstrained firms', suggesting that some kind of lead-lag effect exists. Finally, I find some heterogeneity in the responsiveness of different industries to the ECB's <b>expansionary</b> unconventional <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> announcements...|$|R

500|$|In early February, ECB {{president}} Mario Draghi {{agreed that}} <b>expansionary</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> like QE {{have not been}} undertaken to deliberately cause devaluation. Draghi's statement did however hint that the ECB may take action if the Euro continues to appreciate, and this saw {{the value of the}} European currency fall considerably. A mid February statement from the G7 affirmed the advanced economies commitment to avoid currency war. It was initially read by the markets as an endorsement of Japan's actions, though later clarification suggested the US would like Japan to tone down some of its language, specifically by not linking policies like QE to an expressed desire to devalue the Yen. Most commentators have asserted that if a new round of competitive devaluation occurs it would be harmful for the global economy. [...] However some analysts have stated that Japan's planned actions could be in the long term interests {{of the rest of the}} world; just as he did for the 2010–11 incident, economist Barry Eichengreen has suggested that even if many other countries start intervening against their currencies it could boost growth worldwide, as the effects would be similar to semi-coordinated global monetary expansion. Other analysts have expressed skepticism about the risk of a war breaking out, with Marc Chandler, chief currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, advising that: [...] "A real currency war remains a remote possibility." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{rational}} expectations hypothesis {{has been used}} to support some strong conclusions about economic policymaking. An example is the policy ineffectiveness proposition developed by Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace. If the Federal Reserve attempts to lower unemployment through <b>expansionary</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> economic agents will anticipate the effects of the change of policy and raise their expectations of future inflation accordingly. This in turn will counteract the expansionary effect of the increased money supply. All that the government can do is raise the inflation rate, not employment. This is a distinctly New Classical outcome. During the 1970s {{rational expectations}} appeared to have made previous macroeconomic theory largely obsolete, which culminated with the Lucas critique. However, rational expectations theory has been widely adopted as a modelling assumption even outside of New Classical macroeconomics thanks to the work of New Keynesians such as Stanley Fischer.|$|E

2500|$|According to the explanation, {{excessive}} monetary liquidity (easy credit, large disposable incomes) potentially occurs while fractional reserve {{banks are}} implementing <b>expansionary</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> (i.e. lowering {{of interest rates}} and flushing the financial system with money supply); this explanation may differ in certain details according to economic philosophy. [...] Those who believe the money supply is controlled exogenously by a central bank may attribute an 'expansionary monetary policy' to said bank and (should one exist) a governing body or institution; others {{who believe that the}} money supply is created endogenously by the banking sector may attribute such a 'policy' with the behavior of the financial sector itself, and view the state as a passive or reactive factor. [...] This may determine how central or relatively minor/inconsequential policies like fractional reserve banking and the central bank's efforts to raise or lower short-term interest rates are to one's view on the creation, inflation and ultimate implosion of an economic bubble. [...] Explanations focusing on interest rates tend to take on a common form, however: When interest rates are set excessively low, (regardless of the mechanism by which it is accomplished) investors tend to avoid putting their capital into savings accounts. Instead, investors tend to leverage their capital by borrowing from banks and invest the leveraged capital in financial assets such as stocks and real estate. [...] Risky leveraged behavior like speculation and Ponzi schemes can lead to an increasingly fragile economy, and may also be part of what pushes asset prices artificially upward until the bubble pops.|$|E
