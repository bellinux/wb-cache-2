40|$|Comets and asteroids {{colliding with}} the {{terrestrial}} planets can deliver volatiles and organic or prebiotic compounds to the planets, thereby depositing on the planets the fundamental building-blocks for life. The inner planets contain heavier and cosmically less abundant elements in an iron-silicate matrix than the giant planets. This {{can be caused}} by the following three mechanisms: uneven fractionation and condensation in the accretionary disk; unequal <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> of the composed matter; and heterogeneous accretion. Asteroid-size bodies consisting of the last low-temperature condensates (similar to most primitive chondritic meteorites, and enriched in hydrated silicates and trapped gases) are believed to have fallen onto the inner planets during the process of the giant planets formation. The relative contribution of either endogenous (i. e. outgassing) or exogenous (i. e. asteroid/comet collisions) sources is difficult to assess, although it is constrained by the pattern of noble gas abundances in the planetary atmospheres...|$|E
40|$|Two {{samples of}} Shergotty and {{a sample of}} EETA 79001 's {{lithology}} A have been analyzed for N, He, Ne, and Ar abundances and isotopic composition. After correcting for spallogenic nitrogen, the nitrogen isotopic ratios {{were found to be}} close to that of the terrestrial atmosphere. The spallogenic noble gas data are consistent with cosmic ray irradiation of both Shergotty and EETA 79001 at shallow shielding depths. Cosmic ray exposure ages were estimated to be in the range of 0. 5 - 0. 8 Myr for EETA 79001, and of 2. 0 - 5. 2 Myr for Shergotty, depending on the choice of object size and shielding. Among the two Shergotty samples, the contents of Ar- 40 differed by a factor of 3. This difference can be attributed to either a small-scale mineralogical inhomogeneity or a significant variation in the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> of minerals during shock, although the presence of trapped argon with a high Ar- 40 /Ar- 36 ratio and its heterogeneous distribution cannot be ruled out...|$|E
40|$|Current abundances of radiogenic {{noble gases}} (4 -He, 40 -Ar, 129 -Xe) in the {{planetary}} atmospheres provide valuable information on planetary evolution through their degassing histories. Of these, 40 -Ar (from 40 -K with half life 1. 25 Ga) {{can be used}} to envisage long-term degassing from their interior. Present amounts of 36 and 40 -Ar should have information on timing and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> from the interior. On the other hand, 129 -Xe (from 129 -I with half life 17 Ma) is used in discussing early planetary degassing. Because life time of helium in the atmosphere is short, atmospheric 4 -He (from 235 -U, 238 -U, 232 -Th) data might be used only for current degassing. The relative abundance of 40 -Ar in the Cytherean atmosphere is 0. 26 of that in the Earth's atmosphere. We have executed numerical calculation of a 40 -Ar degassing model along with mantle evolution and melt migration. Our result shows that the average magma production rate on Venus is about 5 (km(exp 3) /yr). Duration of plate motion on Venus, if existed, would be less than several hundred million years...|$|E

It was found that glass inclusions in the Galapagos failing rift lavas are higher and more variable in CO 2 /H 2 O (about 0. 641) relative to inclusions in propagating rift lavas (about 0. 245).

30|$|To t a l SO 2 {{emissions}} during January 26, 2011 –March 31, 2012 {{were estimated}} as about 280 kt based on estimated daily SO 2 flux in Fig. 2 (Table 2). The sub-Plinian eruption and lava accumulation stages, and the earlier CV stage (February 1 – 7, 2011) respectively emitted 8 %, 37 % and 20 % {{of the total}} emissions, which indicates that nearly twothirds of the total emissions were emitted {{in the first two}} weeks (Table 2). Saito et al. (2011) estimated bulk sulfur content of 0.05 wt% for Shinmoedake volcano’s magma using chemical analyses of minerals and melt inclusions. Based on the sulfur content, petrological SO 2 emission can be estimated using the observed erupted magma mass (Table 2). The estimated SO 2 emissions during the sub-Plinian eruption and lava accumulation stages were, respectively, 0.8 – 1.4 and 2.3 – 2.9 times greater than the petrological SO 2 emissions. These values correspond to the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> excess <b>degassing</b> (Shinohara, 2008). According to compiled data presented in table of Shinohara (2008), the range <b>of</b> the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> excess <b>degassing</b> for the 2011 Shinmoedake eruptions is {{at the low end of}} values for subduction zone volcanoes, which are 1 – 30 and 1 – 20, respectively, for explosive and effusive andesitic eruptions. The low value for the sub-Plinian eruption stage can be attributed to underestimation of observed SO 2 flux (see the last paragraph in Section 5).|$|R
30|$|Ground {{observations}} and satellite based instrument measurements of many explosive and effusive volcanic eruptions compiled by Shinohara (2008) show that SO 2 emissions are usually {{greater than those}} estimated using erupted magma mass and dissolved S content in magma obtained in petrological studies. This difference is called “excess degassing”. Because understanding <b>of</b> the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> excess <b>degassing</b> and its mechanisms can provide insight into eruption processes (Shinohara, 2008), {{it is important to}} obtain both directly measured and petrologically estimated amounts of SO 2 emissions accurately. For gas emission measurements, it is necessary to measure the variation of the flux throughout the eruptive activity, including the post eruptive degassing period.|$|R
40|$|Conduction current {{measurements}} {{have been}} carried out in a variety of highly degassed hydrocarbon liquids using plane and spherical electrodes, at field strengths between 50 kV/cm and breakdown. These liquids have been analysed by means of a high resolution chromatography apparatus and a marked dependence of the reproducibility of the results and the purity of the liquid was found. Steady currents in the region of 10 - 6 A have been recorded, these being greater by several orders of magnitude than those found by other investigators under similar conditions. This high value of current has been established to be due to the high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> of the liquids used in this project. Measurements were made on the instability of the current, fast pulses in the microsecond region, particle movement and breakdown. No relationship was found between any of the electrical properties of the gap and the state of the electrode surfaces or the material used, although there was a marked change in the maximum value of the conduction current and some variation in the pattern of the instability when different liquids were tested. When using 3 mm diameter, stainless steel, parallel plane electrodes the breakdown strength was found to be approximately 400 kV/cm and independent of the liquid used. A mechanism has been proposed, based on realignment of the liquid molecules {{under the influence of the}} high electric field, and appears to be well able to explain the majority of the experimental observations...|$|E
40|$|The volcanogenic {{component}} of 54 ash layers and ash-bearing sediments recovered at Sites 907, 908, and 913 (Ocean Drill-ing Program Leg 151) in the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian Seas (Iceland Plateau, Greenland Basin, Hovgàrd Ridge) consists mainly of colorless and/or light to dark brown glass particles {{with an average}} medium grain size of 100 µm (± 60 µm); crystals and lithics are minor constituents. Colorless glass shards are primarily bubble wall shards and pumice fragments. Most light to dark-brown glass shards are slightly vesicular or dense blocky shards, but highly vesicular or pumice-like fragments also occur. The compositions of glass shards comprise subalkalic and low-K subalkalic basaltic (27 % of all analyzed shards), basaltic-andesitic (9 %), andesitic (6 %), dacitic (< 1 %), and trachytic (4 %), as well as low-K and high-K rhyolitic (47 % and 7 %, respec-tively). The rhyolitic and trachytic tephra deposits {{can be attributed to}} highly explosive Plinian eruptions. Some mafic or intermedi-ate ash deposits of Hole 907 A show the influence of hydroclastic fragmentation processes, suggesting submarine or subglacial/ sublacustrine eruption environments. Major element compositions suggest that most ash layers are derived from Iceland {{and to a lesser extent}} from the Jan Mayen System. The oldest basaltic ashes of Hole 907 A possibly originate from submarine erup-tions at the ancient Kolbeinsey Ridge as indicated by their particle shape and the low <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>degassing.</b> The well-preserved record of middle to late Miocene ash deposits in Hole 907 A indicates a short but strong increase in explosive volcanic activity during the late middle Miocene but relatively low activity rates for early middle Miocene and late Miocene...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that the Apollo 15 green and Apollo 17 orange glass beads are of volcanic origin. The diffusion profiles of volatiles in these glass beads {{are believed to}} be due to degassing during eruption (Saal et al., 2008). The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> depends on the initial temperature and cooling rate. Therefore, the estimations of volatiles in parental magmas of lunar pyroclastic deposits depend on melt cooling rates. Furthermore, lunar glass beads may have cooled in volcanic environments on the moon. Therefore, the cooling rates may be used to assess the atmospheric condition in an early moon, when volcanic activities were common. The cooling rates of glasses can be inferred from direct heat capacity measurements on the glasses themselves (Wilding et al., 1995, 1996 a,b). This method does not require knowledge of glass cooling environments and has been applied to calculate the cooling rates of natural silicate glasses formed in different terrestrial environments. We have carried out heat capacity measurements on hand-picked lunar glass beads using a Netzsch DSC 404 C Pegasus differential scanning calorimeter at University of Munich. Our preliminary results suggest that the cooling rate of Apollo 17 orange glass beads may be ~ 12 K/min, based on the correlation between temperature of the heat capacity curve peak in the glass transition range and glass cooling rate. The results imply that the parental magmas of lunar pyroclastic deposits may have contained more water initially than the early estimations (Saal et al., 2008), which used higher cooling rates, 60 - 180 K/min in the modeling. Furthermore, lunar volcanic glass beads could have been cooled in a hot gaseous medium released from volcanic eruptions, not during free flight. Therefore, our results may shed light on atmospheric condition in an early moon...|$|E
30|$|Three {{proposed}} mechanisms {{exist for}} the source of excess degassing: pre-eruptive bubbles in erupted magma, <b>degassing</b> <b>of</b> a convecting magma column, and a permeable gas flow model (Shinohara, 2008). For Plinian eruptions, pre-eruptive gas bubbles in a magma chamber are the strongest candidate (Wallace, 2001; Scaillet et al., 2003). For effusive eruptions, all three mechanisms can cause excess degassing, but the likelihood of pre-eruptive bubbles is especially strong for those that immediately follow an explosive eruption (Shinohara, 2008). Regarding the 2011 Shinmoedake eruption, if one assumes that the contribution of pre-eruptive bubbles is the source <b>of</b> excess <b>degassing</b> for the lava accumulation stages, then the relative amount of pre-eruptive bubbles in the magma chamber was probably low compared to the eruptions of Mt. St. Helens (Bluth et al., 1993; Gerlach and McGee, 1994) and Redout (Gerlach et al., 1994) volcanoes, which had similar explosive eruptive sequences followed by effusive eruptions, with a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> excess <b>degassing</b> (greater than 8) for eruptions of both types (Shinohara, 2008).|$|R

40|$|Peralkaline rhyolites of the Greater Olkaria Volcanic Complex, Kenya Rift Valley, {{were derived}} from separated, though closely related, magma chambers. Ion {{microprobe}} analyses of glass inclusions in quartz phenocrysts show pre-eruptive water contents of up to 3. 4 wt% contrasting with previous estimates that the magmas were anhydrous. The values approach predicted solubility levels corresponding to water saturation at low crustal pressures (1 kbar). The glass matrices of the rhyolites have low water contents, ranging from 0. 07 to 0. 46 wt%, suggesting significant degassing during, or prior to, eruption. Infrared measurements of the matrix glasses show variation in the relative proportions of the two hydrous species dissolved in the glasses. The amount of molecular water, determined semi-quantitatively, apparently increases with increased fluorine content and peralkalinity. This suggests a competition between hydroxyl groups and fluoride ions for similar sites within the melt structure. The mechanism <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> has been investigated using hydrogen isotopes. The range of D values in most rocks can be produced by varied <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> open-system <b>degassing</b> <b>of</b> rhyolite melt initially in equilibrium with water of a fixed, or limited, D value. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} closed-system degassing may also have been a significant component in some rhyolites. The exact mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> remain uncertain.

40|$|A {{convenient}} {{method for}} the investigation of gas transport in alkali halides is offered by the possibility to load single crystals homogeneously with radioactive rare gas; (1) {{in the case of}} potassium chloride with Ar- 39 through the reaction K(n, p) Ar. The radiation with neutrons will, however, also produce defects of various kinds in the lattice. The experimental results readily show, that the gas atoms interact with radiation-defects, (2), (3) in that the coefficient of diffusion D can be put on the form D ~ 1 /CT, CT being the concentration defects. This, the so called trapping-diffusion-model successfully could explain as a trapping of the gas atoms a the defects (4). Some further work, undertaken to account for certain deviations from expected isothermal degassing curves, did not succeed in bringing these anomalities in consistency with the predictions based on the original assumption mentioned above. The contradictions led to the suggestion that the defects are not stable, but anneal inhomogeneously during the experiment, which in effect means that a time-and-position-depending coefficient of diffusion will have {{to be used in the}} formal description. Due to the fact that the gas produced in potassium chloride crystals is almost completely bound at the defects, there is a method at hand for attaining information on the behaviour of the defects, if the gasprofile, or some function of it, can be determined at low enough temperatures. Thus if the irradiated specimen is heated at a constant temperature until a certain amount of gas has left the crystal, the resulting gasprofile will hold information on the defect profile. Any difference from a gas-profile produced in a system with a constant or only time-depending coefficient of diffusion, will mean that the defect concentration in this experiment has changed time-and-position dependently, which then also pertains the coefficient. For the purpose of measuring gas profiles, a small precision-grinding machine was constructed, which permits the specimen to be grinded along one axis in an evacuated vessel. The radioactive gas, which is set free quantitatively during the grinding process, is measured with a proportional counter at appropriate intervals of grinding. Subsequently the change in length of the specimen along the grinding-axes is determined. The experimental result will thus be available in the form of an integrated activity versus position curve. It should be noted, that the profiles and consequently the coefficient of diffusion, can be calculated explicitly only when diffusion profiles in the specimen of interest have an unique position space dependence, e. g. in a spherical but not a cubic specimen. In the case of a cube, a qualitative evaluation is attainable if the experimental curve is compared to the one calculated from the solutions to Fick's-second-law for a specimen of the same form and the same <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>degassing,</b> i. e. the curve that would result if the defects were perfectly stable or would anneal homogeneously. From experiment performed on cubic specimens of potassium chloride and evaluated as outlined above, it seems fair to conclude, that at least a part of the defects anneal at the surface...|$|E

The mean CO 2 /H 2 O from the propagating rift (0. 245 +/- 0. 068) silicate glass inclusions is significantly lower than that of the actively failing rift (0. 641 +/- 0. 241); this difference probably reflects different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> during magmatic histories for the two regions.

40|$|During its 1800 -year-long {{persistent}} activity the Stromboli volcano has erupted {{a highly}} porphyritic (HP) volatile-poor scoriaceous magma {{and a low}} porphyritic (LP) volatile-rich pumiceous magma. The HP magma is erupted during normal Strombolian explosions and lava effusions, while the LP one is related to more energetic paroxysms. During the March–April 2003 explosive activity, Stromboli ejected two typologies of juvenile glassy ashes, namely highly vesicular LP shards and volatile-poor HP shards. Their textural and in situ chemical characteristics are used to unravel mutual relationships between HP and LP magmas, as well as magma dynamics within the shallow plumbing system. The mantle-normalized trace element patterns of both ash types show the typical arc-lava pattern; however, HP glasses possess incompatible element concentrations higher than LP glasses, along with Sr and Eu negative anomalies. HP shards are generally characterized by higher Li contents (to ~ 20 ppm) and lower δ 7 Li values (+ 1. 2 to − 3. 8 ‰) with respect to LP shards (Li contents of 7 – 14 ppm and δ 7 Li ranging between + 4. 6 and + 0. 9 ‰). Fractional crystallization models based on major and trace element compositions, combined with a degassing model based on open-system Rayleigh distillation and {{on the assumption that}} melt/fluidDLi > 1, show that abundant (~ 30 %) plagioclase precipitation and variable <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> can lead the more primitive LP magma to evolve toward a differentiated (isotopically lighter) HP magma ponding in the upper conduit and undergoing slow continuous degassing-induced crystallization. This study also evidences that in March 2003 Stromboli volcano poured out a small early volume of LP magma that traveled slower within the conduit with respect to later and larger volumes of fast ascending LP magma erupted during the April 5 paroxysm. The different ascent rates and cooling rates of the two LP magma batches (i. e., pre- and post-paroxysm) resulted in small, but detectable, differences in their chemical signatures. Finally, this study highlights the high potential of in situ investigations of juvenile glassy ashes in petrologic and geochemical monitoring the volcanic activity and of Li isotopes as tracers <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> processes within the shallow plumbing system...|$|R
40|$|Floor-fractured craters are a {{class of}} lunar crater {{hypothesized}} to form {{in response to the}} emplacement of a shallow magmatic intrusion beneath the crater floor.

We observe the Bouguer anomaly of floor-fractured craters on an individual basis using the unfiltered Bouguer gravity solution from GRAIL and also a degree 100 - 600 band-filtered Bouguer gravity solution. The low-magnitude of anomalies arising from shallow magmatic intrusions makes identification using unfiltered Bouguer gravity solutions inconclusive. The observed anomalies in the degree 100 - 600 Bouguer gravity solution are spatially heterogeneous, although there is spatial correlation between volcanic surface morphologies and positive Bouguer anomalies.

40|$|The 2007 caldera-forming {{eruption}} of Piton de la Fournaise (PdF) erupted the largest volume of magma (210 Mm 3) recorded at this volcano {{in at least}} three centuries. Major and trace element and Sr-Nd isotope data for bulk-rocks, groundmasses and olivine phenocrysts have been combined with melt inclusion data (major, trace and volatile elements) to track magma evolution over the whole eruptive sequence. We show that each eruptive phase had a distinctive geochemical and petrological signature and that caldera collapse on 5 April was preceded by a marked shift in bulk magma composition and crystal content and size. Aphyric basalt erupted {{at the beginning of the}} sequence (February 2007) had relatively high Sr isotope ratio (87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0. 70420 - 0. 704180) and low Nd isotopic ratio (143 Nd/ 144 Nd = 0. 51285 - 0. 51286). Olivine-basalts extruded on 2 - 5 April just before caldera collapse are less enriched in radiogenic Sr (87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0. 70412 - 0. 70416), but characterized by the same Nd isotopic composition. This magma is interpreted as a new deep input, which pressurized the shallow PdF plumbing system and triggered the 2007 activity. Post-collapse oceanite lavas represent the main volume of magma extruded in 2007. Their bulk-rocks and groundmasses have 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (~ 0. 70418) intermediate between those of February and 5 April, and similar to those of the March 2007 and 2001 - 2006 lavas. We show that the Steady State Basalts (SSB) commonly erupted at PdF are hybrid melts, which result from multistep mixing between 'alkaline' and 'transitional' end-members. Our results lead us to propose a new model of the PdF plumbing system to reconcile the petrological, geochemical and geophysical observations: (1) the shallow portion (above sea level) of the PdF plumbing system hosts several small sills, in which magma experiences variable <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>degassing,</b> cooling and crystallization; (2) oceanite lavas result from the withdrawal of shallow harrisitic mushes stored at low pressures (< 48 MPa; < 1800 - 2400 m depth) below both the volcano summit and its eastern flank; (3) water degassing plays a major role in fast magma crystallization at shallow depths. Multistep ascent and periodic extrusion of the shallow magmas is promoted by injections of deeper and hotter basaltic magma, containing up to 1. 3 wt % H 2 O and 1630 ppm S. In 2007, the new deep input was the ultimate source of the large excess in sulfur degassing detected by satellites. Lateral draining and intrusion of magma below the eastern flank of the volcano are the cause of major volcano deformation, flank sliding and summit caldera collapse. © The Author 2014.

The results demonstrate a catalytic effect of CA on the rate limiting carbonate reactions, increasing CO 2 exchange between nitrogen and water, and indirectly accelerating the precipitation of carbonates for a system controlled by rate <b>of</b> <b>degassing.</b> The results <b>of</b> this study have applications to large-scale storage of CO 2 by mineralisation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMount Merapi {{is one of}} Indonesia’s and the world’s most {{hazardous}} volcanoes. Existing {{constraints on}} the location and the crystallization conditions of its pre-eruptive magma reservoir based on mineral and glass thermobarometry and geophysical surveys are inconclusive, yet of immediate importance for future hazard mitigation. Here, we use two series of phase equilibrium experiments to quantify the conditions of pre-eruptive magma storage and magma recharge in Merapi’s upper-crustal reservoir: (1) to characterize crystallization at total equilibrium conditions; (2) to characterize crystallization at local equilibrium conditions between crystal rims and host melt. We demonstrate that this experimental approach can constrain pre-eruptive crystallization conditions and their variation in crystal-rich, mixed magma systems, {{such as that of}} Merapi, for which standard crystallization experiments and mineral thermobarometry fail. In agreement with geophysical estimates, we infer that Mount Merapi’s pre-eruptive reservoir partially crystallizes at ≥ 100 – 200 ± 75 MPa and thus at relatively shallow depths of c. ≥ 4 · 5 to ∼ 9 km. Magmas are stored at ≥ 925 – 950 ± 25 °C with a melt H 2 O content of ∼ 3 – 4 wt % and a vapour phase with an XH 2 O [H 2 O/(H 2 O + CO 2) ] of ∼ 0 · 5 – 0 · 6 ± 0 · 1. Pre-eruptive recharge magmas, in contrast, have a temperature > 950 to < 1000 °C, a higher melt H 2 O content of ∼ 4 – 5 wt % and a vapour phase with a higher XH 2 O of ∼ 0 · 8 ± 0 · 1. We hypothesize that these variations in melt H 2 O content and vapour XH 2 O between resident and pre-eruptive recharge magmas relate to variable <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> open-system <b>degassing</b> <b>of</b> magma parcels en route into the reservoir rather than to variations in volatile fluxing of the stored magmas...|$|R

Trends in melt inclusion major element and water concentrations form the evolved extension of other Mexican volcanics including those {{presumed to be}} derived directly from primitive melts. Water concentrations in Popocatépetl and Colima melt inclusions are similar (0. 3 to 3. 4 wt. % H 2 O). Melt-vapor equilibration pressures calculated from dissolved H 2 O and CO 2 (Popocatépetl) or H 2 O (Colima) in melt inclusions correspond to depths of entrapment of 12 km or less. Water and carbon dioxide concentrations correlate negatively with SiO 2 and potassium. Normalized olivine–augite–quartz compositions are consistent with near cotectic crystallization under vapor-saturated conditions at pressures of 1. 5 kb or less. Our results show that Popocatépetl and Colima magmas have undergone vapor-saturated crystallization during ascent in conjunction with varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> mixing between <b>degassed</b> rhyodacitic and less degassed, mafic melts in the upper portions of the crust. These data suggest melt evolution occurred in conduits or inter-fingered dikes rather than a large stratified magma chamber...|$|R

40|$|As magma ascends and decompresses, {{volatile}} exsolution {{not only}} produces bubbles, but increases the liquidus {{temperature of the}} residual melt, resulting in an undercooling that can trigger crystallisation. In volcanic systems of intermediate composition, late-stage crystallisation and vesiculation in the shallow conduit {{have been shown to}} exert a strong control on eruptive style. These processes may be similarly important during subsurface and surface transport of basaltic melts. In recent experiments we demonstrated that the lag between degassing and crystallisation is sufficiently short that crystallisation as a consequence <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> can be expected to occur in the conduit, depending on ascent rates. Up to 35 % volume crystals were observed to grow as a result <b>of</b> the <b>degassing</b> <b>of</b> < 1 wt% water. Degassing-induced crystallisation therefore has the potential to rapidly and profoundly change magma rheology before and during eruption, and so have a strong influence on the eruptive style. The effects of degassing-induced crystallisation on rheology depend on crystal fraction, morphology and size distribution. Timescales of rheology changes also depend on crystal growth rates. Here we report on experiments designed to quantify these characteristics. We use a microscope with a heated stage to directly observe crystallisation events and record crystal growth at temperatures up to 1300 °C. Experiments are conducted on quenched (i. e. with near-eruptive volatile content) samples from Mt. Etna, Sicily, and Mauna Loa, Hawaii, and recorded with time lapse imaging. From these images, crystal growth rates as a result <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> are measured, and the crystal contents, morphologies and size distributions at different stages <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> determined. The undercooling experienced by the samples as a result <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> can be estimated from the crystal morphology. Crystal contents on eruption are much higher at Etna (~ 30 %) than Hawaii (~ 2 %), meaning the effects <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> on samples with radically different initial textures can be observed. Comparing textures produced during degassing with those produced during cooling at different rates allows assessment of the contribution <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> to textural evolution of the lava, and hence could provide a means of estimating the effect <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> on magma rheology. This work has implications for the modelling of magma flow in conduits, and of the flow of lava after eruption...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{chemical}} model <b>of</b> magma <b>degassing</b> based on nine volatile species part of S-O-H-C-Fe-bearing rhyolitic melts. It {{is based on}} equilibrium, closed-system degassing, and does not take in account the crystallization of mineral phases. For given initial conditions at depth, the model calculates the gas composition as pressure decreases, {{as well as physical}} variables controlling conduit flow. We conducted a parametric study <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> by varying initial conditions at depth within the range typical of arc magmas and characterizing the chemical evolution of the volatile components during the ascent to the surface. The resulting complex patterns of chemical changes are controlled by four groups of interrelated parameters: (1) redox state, fH 2, and H 2 S/SO 2 ratio in the gas phase, (2) gas amount, (3) melt water content and fH 2 O, and (4) relative melt sulfur content, fCO 2, and C/S ratio in the gas phase. The other <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom (temperature, initial pressure, and melt iron content) alter the amplitude of the chemical fluctuations during ascent, but do not change the general degassing patterns. When degassing starts at depth, volatile chemistry has little effect on the amount <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> as measured by the evolution of porosity. Magma expansion at shallow levels, however, can be greatly affected by degassing chemistry...|$|R
