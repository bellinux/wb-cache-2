5|$|Perry Como {{never forgot}} Canonsburg either. One {{of the things}} he did to give a helping <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> home town was to {{convince}} RCA to open a record-pressing plant there. Those who needed to raise funds for local projects like Boys' and Girls' Clubs found him always ready to do whatever was needed.|$|E
5|$|All {{witnesses}} {{generally agreed}} that the first two shots were almost indistinguishable from each other. General firing immediately broke out. Virgil and Wyatt thought Tom was armed. When shooting started, the horse that Tom McLaury held jumped to one side. Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw his <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> right hip. Virgil said Tom followed the horse's movement, hiding behind it, and fired once or twice over the horse's back.|$|E
5|$|During the screening, {{the court}} heard that Muhammad had raised his <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{forehead}} and moved his leg after the cameraman {{had said he}} was dead, {{and that there was}} no blood on his shirt. Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.|$|E
6000|$|He raised <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> forehead--his silk hat was on {{the table}} rim upwards; he had put it there with a despairing gesture as he came in--he raised <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> forehead. [...] "It seems to me unfair. I--" [...] He broke off again. Anthony looked at Flora who stood by the side of her father.|$|R

5|$|In the Belmont, Paynter led {{for most}} of the race until the final furlong when Smith came off the rail, {{allowing}} winner Union Rags to slip through and win by a neck. Paynter had already fended off two challengers during the race, and Smith had switched his whip from his right <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> left in an attempt to fend off a late challenge from Atigun; Smith considered his decision to be an error that cost him the race.|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{advanced}} to the NBA Finals {{for the first time}} in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who had Magic Johnson and James Worthy, two formidable opponents. The Bulls won the series four games to one, and compiled an outstanding 15–2 playoff record along the way. Perhaps the best known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his right <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket. In his first Finals appearance, Jordan posted per game averages of 31.2 points on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 assists, 6.6 rebounds, 2.8 steals, and 1.4 blocks. Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award, and he cried while holding the NBA Finals trophy.|$|E
5|$|Debates are {{punctuated with}} {{vigorous}} gestures which enliven the ambience of the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, robed {{in a formal}} monk’s attire. Some of the gestures (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic gestures are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender’s arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender, the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap the defender into a wrong line of argument. Each time a new question is asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a question is answered correctly, it is acknowledged by the teacher bringing {{the back of his}} right <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> left palm. When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.|$|E

500|$|On Michigan's second {{play from}} scrimmage, quarterback Benny Friedman {{completed}} {{a pass to}} Bruce Gregory for a 20-yard gain, and Bo Molenda then ran 18 yards for a touchdown. [...] Michigan scored its second touchdown when William Flora blocked a punt and recovered {{the ball in the}} end zone. [...] According to one account, Flora broke threw the line so quickly {{that he was able to}} snatch the ball as it dropped from the punter's <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> foot. [...] On the next scoring drive, Friedman passed to Sammy Babcock and then threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Molenda. [...] Michigan led 21–0 at the end of the first quarter.|$|E
2500|$|The Valar then {{learned that}} Melkor was {{manipulating}} Fëanor, and sent Tulkas to capture Melkor, {{but he had}} already escaped. With Finwë and Fëanor's absence, Fingolfin had become king, and so it seemed that Melkor's lies were true. Melkor tried again to convince Fëanor of them, but Fëanor realised that Melkor's true goal was to obtain the Silmarils, [...] "and he shut the doors of his house {{in the face of}} the mightiest of all the dwellers in Eä." [...] In a rage, Melkor left. The Valar invited Fëanor and Fingolfin to Valinor to make peace. Fingolfin offered a <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> half-brother, recognising Fëanor's place as the eldest. He gave his pledge to follow his elder brother and Fëanor accepted.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2013, Carl's mother Nora White is {{introduced}} {{for a single}} episode, played by Lynn Farleigh, when he and Kirsty visit her in a nursing home. Inside Soap said that Nora is [...] "pure, unbridled evil" [...] and her introduction might show why Carl is a menace, giving viewers a [...] "glimpse into [...] twisted upbringing". They said there is tension between Carl and Nora, and compared her digging her fingernails into his <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> burning of Ian's hand, asking [...] "has Carl learnt everything he knows from his evil mum?" [...] Jim Shelley thought that Nora's introduction [...] "seemed to {{be the start of}} a campaign trying to garner some sympathy for Carl—henceforth, a nasty, charmless bully". Coonan said that Nora is [...] "dominating and horrible" [...] and shows that Carl has [...] "demons within his own family" [...] and a [...] "troubled background".|$|E

2500|$|El Greco {{regarded}} {{color as}} the most important and the most ungovernable element of painting ("I hold the imitation of color to be the greatest difficulty of art."—Notes of the painter in one of his commentaries). He declared that color had primacy over drawing; thus his opinion on Michelangelo was that [...] "he was a good man, but {{he did not know how}} to paint". Francisco Pacheco, a painter and theoretician who visited El Greco in 1611, was startled by the painter's technique: [...] "If I say that Domenico Greco sets his <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> canvases many and many times over, that he worked upon them again and again, but to leave the colors crude and unblent in great blots as a boastful display of his dexterity?" [...] Pacheco asserts that [...] "El Greco believed in constant repainting and retouching in order to make the broad masses tell flat as in nature".|$|E
2500|$|However, Nemțeanu {{has also}} {{gathered}} favorable notice, in particular for his [...] "poems in pencil, capturing the pathos {{of everyday life}} and of the tiny bourgeois provinces". In 1919, publicist Constantin V. Gerota confessed: [...] "I had rarely seen such sincerity and so little gravitas, such little affectation [...] Nemțeanu was a jester in his poetry. He did not spend hour upon hour with his <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> temple, only to produce the same as what others have said before him." [...] A [...] "delicate, affable, intimate poet", he [...] "had no great concept of life", but rather focused on [...] "sentimental attitudes". Contrarily, Albert Honigman, the reviewer at Universul Literar, saw Nemțeanu as a Romanian Heine, who, beyond a [...] "note of sentiment" [...] and a [...] "delicacy of expression", poured conscious thought into his poetry. Dragomirescu suggests the same, also noting that, had he lived to produce more works, Nemțeanu could have entered a [...] "realm of the great poetry." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{it would}} not be Andronikos who would fight the Normans but Isaac Angelos, a {{great-grandson}} of Alexios I, was foretold by a soothsayer that he would one day rule the empire. Andronikos could not bear such a prophecy and ordered his immediate arrest by courtier Stephen Hagiochristophorites. This backfired for Andronikos, with Isaac killing Stephen and arousing the citizens within the Hagia Sophia to rise in revolt. Prisons were opened and the prisoners joined the riot. Andronikos seems to have taken this lightly, as yet another tiresome rebellion to destroy – only when the palace guards refused to obey him did he realise {{the full extent of the}} danger. [...] He planned to escape with his teen wife Agnes of France and his concubine Maraptike aboard a galley. He was caught before he could execute his escape – and suffered dearly for it: [...] "They beat him, stoned him, goaded him with spikes, pelted him with filth. A woman of the streets poured boiling water on his head...Then dragging him from the camel, they hung him up by his feet. At last, after much agony, he died, carrying his remaining <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mouth; which he did in the opinion of some, that he might suck the blood that flowed from one of his wounds." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sylvan Barnet {{believes}} {{that in this}} adaptation, [...] "Kate and Petruchio fall in love {{almost as soon as}} they see each other." [...] Barbara Hodgdon has also pointed out that several times, Katherina can be seen gazing longingly at Petruchio. Critics have also noted that Katherina twice consciously makes the decision to go along with Petruchio. The first moment is behind the stained glass window, when she silently decides to marry him. The second is when she follows him after he leaves her at the gates of Padua. In this version, Katherina delivers her final speech seemingly without irony. Zeffirelli and Burton both wanted Elizabeth Taylor to deliver the speech ironically, a la Mary Pickford, but Taylor felt {{it would be better to}} speak seriously, and then undermine that seriousness by leaving the banquet without Petruchio, thus subverting his apparent authority over her. However, Elizabeth Schafer calls the film [...] "intensely conservative," [...] citing the controversial advertising blurb; [...] "A motion picture for every man who ever gave the back of his <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> beloved...and for every woman who deserved it. Which takes in a lot of people! Russell Jackson argues the film [...] "offers a 1960s liberation more likely to appeal to Lawrentians than present-day feminists." [...] However, Schafer does go on to acknowledge that [...] "because of the sheer power of Taylor's presence, Katherina occupies a far more memorable filmic space than the dramatic space she has in the original play.|$|E
