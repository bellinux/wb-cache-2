In 1999, surprisingly, the <b>imagoes</b> attacked both commercial cornfields and hybrid seed plots, both with very high intensity.

During the botched escape attempt, it is {{revealed}} that Rebecca, Will's adoptive sister, is actually a Styx implanted in his family to monitor him. The boys head through a series of tunnels to the Eternal City, and old stone city, estimated by Will to be from Roman times, where the air is filled with deadly bio-toxins. They avoid the Styx soldiers, who patrol the city with their vicious stalker attack dogs, and eventually emerge {{on the bank of the}} Thames. Will makes for his home in Highfield, but there Will's health deteriorates, so Cal helps him to his Auntie Jean's flat where he recovers. Soon they return underground to find Will's adoptive father, and attempt to rescue Chester once again. They encounter another Styx patrol, and Uncle Tam kills a member of the Styx, whom he calls Crawfly, but is mortally wounded in the fight, and the strong willed Uncle Tam chooses to stay behind to give the boys time to escape. With the help of <b>Imago</b> Freebone, a member of Uncle Tam's gang, Will and Cal escape to a small hiding place halfway between the Colony and the Eternal City. There, they rest and mourn for Uncle Tam; and are told by <b>Imago</b> that Chester's train to the deeps will pass directly under their hiding spot shortly. They jump down into the train through a hole in the floor of the hiding spot, and find Chester. Together they ride down to the Deeps. In the book's epilogue, Rebecca kills <b>Imago,</b> who was hiding on the surface, by poison.|$|E
5|$|Beetles {{are members}} of the {{superorder}} Endopterygota, and accordingly most of them undergo complete metamorphosis. The typical form of metamorphosis in beetles passes through four main stages: the egg, the larva, the pupa, and the <b>imago</b> or adult. The larvae are commonly called grubs and the pupa sometimes is called the chrysalis. In some species, the pupa may be enclosed in a cocoon constructed by the larva towards the end of its final instar. Some beetles, such as typical members of the families Meloidae and Rhipiphoridae, go further, undergoing hypermetamorphosis in which the first instar {{takes the form of a}} triungulin.|$|E

5|$|Browerian mimicry, {{named after}} Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower, is a {{postulated}} form of automimicry; where the model {{belongs to the}} same species as the mimic. This is the analogue of Batesian mimicry within a single species, and occurs {{when there is a}} palatability spectrum within a population. Examples include the monarch and the queen from the Danainae subfamily, which feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. These species store toxins from its host plant, which are maintained even in the adult (<b>imago)</b> form. As levels of toxin vary depending on diet during the larval stage, some individuals are more toxic than others. Less palatable organisms, therefore, mimic more dangerous individuals, with their likeness already perfected.|$|E
5|$|Fleas are {{holometabolous}} insects, {{going through}} the four lifecycle stages of egg, larva, pupa, and <b>imago</b> (adult). In most species, neither female nor male fleas are fully mature when they first emerge but must feed on blood before they become capable of reproduction. The first blood meal triggers the maturation of the ovaries in females and {{the dissolution of the}} testicular plug in males, and copulation soon follows. Some species breed all year round while others synchronise their activities with their hosts' life cycles or with local environmental factors and climatic conditions. Flea populations consist of roughly 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults.|$|E

40|$|Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera Le Conte) is very {{important}} corn pest. The pest was spread in Croatia from 1995 to 1999 on 12, 750 km 2. In the area of Stara Gunja, hybrid OSSK 444 was sown in order to investigate the possibilities of controls WCR with below ground insecticides - Counter G- 5, Dursban G- 7, 5 and Dotan G- 5. With checking root for larvae and cocoons 0. 02 larvae was estimated on treated plots and 0. 05 larvae on untreated plots. The number of cocoons was 0. 12 in treated, and 0. 25 on untreated plots. The number of <b>imagoes</b> on silk was 0. 05 – 0. 10 per plant. The <b>imagoes</b> of the WCR were caught with Pheromone and Multigard traps from the third decade of June until {{the first decade of}} October. On the traps settled on the treated plot (336 m 2), 1, 376 <b>imagoes</b> were caught, compared to untreated plot (112 m 2) where 431 <b>imagoes</b> were caught.

Low number of caught <b>imagoes</b> per plant, shows that, for now, the implementation of chemical preparations wasn’t justified.

40|$|Background: The frontal gland is {{a unique}} {{adaptation}} of advanced termite families. It has been intensively studied in soldiers with respect to its anatomy and chemistry, with numerous novel compounds being discovered within the tremendous richness of identified products. At the same time, {{the presence of the}} frontal gland in non-soldier castes received only negligible attention in the past. Principal Findings: Here, we report {{on the development of the}} frontal gland in alate <b>imagoes</b> of 10 genera and 13 species of Rhinotermitidae and Serritermitidae, in order to shed light on the evolution and function of this gland in <b>imagoes.</b> All investigated species possess a frontal gland. In most cases, it is well-developed and equipped with a sac-like reservoir, located in the postero-dorsal part of cranium, but reaching as far as the seventh abdominal segment in some Rhinotermitinae. The only exception is the genus Psammotermes, in which the gland is very small and devoid of the reservoir. Conclusions: Our direct observations and comparisons with soldiers suggest a defensive role of the gland in <b>imagoes</b> of all studied species. This functional analogy, along with the anatomic homology between the frontal gland in soldiers and <b>imagoes,</b> make it likely that the gland appeared once during the early evolution of rhinotermitid ancestors, and remained a...|$|R

5|$|Holometabolism, or {{complete}} metamorphosis, {{is where the}} insect changes in four stages, an egg or embryo, a larva, a pupa and the adult or <b>imago.</b> In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form {{can be one of}} several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin. Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults. Butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, although most insects use this life cycle. Some insects have evolved this system to hypermetamorphosis.|$|E

5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{stage of}} the insect is the winged adult or <b>imago.</b> The surface of both butterflies and moths is covered by scales, {{each of which is}} an outgrowth from a single epidermal cell. The head is small and dominated by the two large compound eyes. These are capable of distinguishing flower shapes or motion but not for clearly viewing distant objects. Colour perception is good, especially in some species in the blue/violet range. The antennae are composed of many segments and have clubbed tips (unlike moths that have tapering or feathery antennae). The sensory receptors are concentrated in the tips and can detect odours. Taste receptors are located on the palps and on the feet. The mouthparts are designed for sucking and the mandibles are usually reduced in size or absent. The first maxillae are elongated into a tubular proboscis which is curled up at rest and expanded when needed to feed. The first and second maxillae bear palps which function as sensory organs. Some species have a reduced proboscis or maxillary palps and do not feed as adults.|$|E
