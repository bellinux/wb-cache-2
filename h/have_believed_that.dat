5|$|After the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a {{messenger}} from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that the starving British Band {{was going back}} across the Mississippi and would fight no more. No one in the American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret. Black Hawk may <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the Americans had gotten the message, {{and that they had}} not pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. He apparently expected that the Americans were going to let his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.|$|E
5|$|The Scilly Isles {{supported}} Charles I {{during the}} English Civil War, {{and after a}} short period in Parliamentary control rebelled in favour of Charles in 1648. The Royalists on Tresco appeared to <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> King Charles's Castle was a critical defensive point {{on the island and}} probably built new earthwork defences around the castle to defend it against an attack from the land. It is possible, however, that these defences instead date from around 1627, and were built by the King's engineer, Bernard Johnson. During this period the castle was given its current name.|$|E

25|$|While many historians {{through the}} centuries <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the Franks were outnumbered {{at the onset of}} battle by at least two to one, the most {{authentic}} source called the Mozarabic Chronicle of 754, points to the contrary.|$|E
25|$|In Christian belief, {{both the}} righteous and the unrighteous will be resurrected {{at the last}} judgment. The righteous will receive incorruptible, immortal bodies (1 Corinthians 15), while the unrighteous {{will be sent to}} hell. Traditionally, Christians <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> hell will be a place of eternal {{physical}} and psychological punishment. In the last two centuries, annihilationism has become popular.|$|E

25|$|The Greeks may <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the Hesperides was {{situated}} in modern Morocco. Some scholars situate it in Tangier where Antaeus lived, {{according to some}} myths.

The Atlas mountain was worshipped by the Berbers and the Canary Islands represent to many the daughters of Atlas.|$|E
25|$|In retrospect, {{the tragedy}} of May 4, 1970, should not have occurred. The {{students}} may <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> they were right in continuing their mass protest {{in response to the}} Cambodian invasion, even though this protest followed the posting and reading by the university of an order to ban rallies and an order to disperse. These orders have since been determined by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to have been lawful.|$|E
25|$|In the Septuagint and New Testament {{the authors}} used the Greek term Hades for the Hebrew Sheol, but often with Jewish rather than Greek {{concepts}} in mind. In the Jewish concept of Sheol, such {{as expressed in}} Ecclesiastes, Sheol or Hades {{is a place where}} there is no activity. However, since Augustine, Christians <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the souls of those who die either rest peacefully, in the case of Christians, or are afflicted, {{in the case of the}} damned, after death until the resurrection.|$|E

25|$|The pilot also misinformed ATC {{that he is}} {{executing}} ILS approach, {{while in}} fact he was not. The ILS was likely operational, but the ILS frequency was not set because the pilots assumed it was not operational. When the ILS indicator is not in use, its needle is in the middle, same as when the aircraft is exactly following the glideslope. Therefore, the report suggests that the pilot may <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> {{he is on the}} glideslope, even though he was significantly below it.|$|E
25|$|Prehistoric Wales {{in terms}} of human {{settlements}} covers the period from about 230,000 years ago, the date attributed to the earliest human remains found in what is now Wales, to the year AD 48 when the Roman army began a military campaign against one of the Welsh tribes. Traditionally, historians <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> successive waves of immigrants brought different cultures into the area, largely replacing the previous inhabitants, with the last wave of immigrants being the Celts. However, studies of population genetics now suggest that this may not be true, and that immigration was on a smaller scale.|$|E
25|$|Travelling to France {{under the}} guise of a {{diplomatic}} mission, Isabella began an affair with Roger Mortimer, and the two agreed to depose Edward and oust the Despenser family. The Queen returned to England with a small mercenary army in 1326, moving rapidly across England. The King's forces deserted him. Isabella deposed Edward, becoming regent on behalf of her son, Edward III. Many <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> Isabella then arranged the murder of Edward II. Isabella and Mortimer’s regime began to crumble, partly because of her lavish spending, but also because the Queen successfully, but unpopularly, resolved long-running problems such as the wars with Scotland.|$|E

25|$|Well-attested {{myths of}} the Proto-Indo-Europeans include a myth {{involving}} a storm god who slays a multi-headed serpent that dwells in water, a myth about the Sun and Moon riding in chariots across the sky, and a creation story involving two brothers, {{one of whom}} is sacrificed by the other in order to create the world. The Proto-Indo-Europeans may <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the Otherworld was guarded by some kind of watchdog and could only be reached by crossing a river. They also may have believed in some kind of world tree, bearing fruit of immortality, either guarded by or gnawed on by a serpent or dragon of some kind and tended to by three goddesses, who were believed to spin the thread of life.|$|E
25|$|The Proto-Indo-Europeans {{may have}} {{believed}} {{in some kind}} of world tree. It is also possible that they may <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> this tree was either guarded by or under constant attack from some kind of dragon or serpent. In Norse mythology, the world ash tree Yggdrasil is tended by the three Norns while the dragon Nidhogg gnaws at its roots. In Greek mythology, the tree of the golden apples in the Garden of the Hesperides is tended by the three Hesperides and guarded by the hundred-headed dragon Ladon. In Indo-Iranian texts, there is a mythical tree dripping with Soma, the immortal drink of the gods and, in later Pahlavi sources, an evil lizard is said to lurk at the bottom of it.|$|E
25|$|Hitler issued {{directive}} 16 on 16 July, for {{the preparation}} of an invasion fleet but Göring did not see an invasion as {{the solution to the}} British problem and failed to attend any of the conferences to improve inter-service co-operation for a landing in Britain before 1 August. Göring may still <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the British would negotiate and was content for the Channel battles to continue. On 19 July, Göring decided to escalate the air campaign and approved a directive to destroy British air power. Hitler issued Directive 17 on 1 August, intending the air operation to be a prelude to invasion, which expanded the scope of Göring's 19 July directive. The campaign against the RAF was to begin around 5 August, depending on suitable weather for mass air operations.|$|E

5|$|While I <b>have</b> always <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> {{under the}} First and Fourteenth Amendments neither the State nor the Federal Government has any {{authority}} to regulate or censor the content of speech, I <b>have</b> never <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> any person <b>has</b> a right to give speeches or engage in demonstrations where he pleases and when he pleases.|$|R
25|$|Lincoln's {{personal}} communications, {{even from}} {{around the time of}} his To Whom it May Concern letter, indicate that he might have been willing to privately give ground on slavery. That Lincoln proposed a delayed ratification plan is mentioned by the Augusta Chronicle and Sentinel in June 1865—based on a report by Stephens from after the meeting. From a legal standpoint, Lincoln never believed that the federal government had the authority to ban slavery in the states—thus his constant emphasis on the status of the Emancipation Proclamation as a measure effective only during wartime. According to Paul Escott, Lincoln's moral opposition to slavery did not override his understanding of the Constitution; therefore, Lincoln may <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the rebel states would have a right to reject the Thirteenth Amendment if they rejoined the Union.|$|E
25|$|The {{main reason}} for the quick fall of Kanchanaburi {{could be that the}} Burmese were more battle-hardened. But it could also be that the Siamese command miscalculated where the Burmese main attack would come from, and had not {{sufficiently}} reinforced the fort to withstand a major attack. Judging by the Siamese chronicles' reporting of the main attack route, the Siamese command appeared to <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the main Burmese attack would come from the Gulf of Siam coastline, instead of the most obvious and shortest route via Kanchanaburi. The Siamese sources say that Maha Nawrahta's main invasion route came from southern Tenasserim, crossing the Tenasserim range at Chumphon and Phetburi. The path is totally different from the Kanchanaburi route reported by the Burmese chronicles. Historian Kyaw Thet specifically adds that the main attack route was via the Myitta Pass.|$|E
25|$|Many {{officers}} in the Indian army believed revolt was possible, and they prepared for the worst. In Amritsar, more than 15,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh. The British Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab, Michael O'Dwyer, is said to <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> these were the early and ill-concealed signs of a conspiracy for a coordinated revolt around May, {{at a time when}} British troops would have withdrawn to the hills for the summer. The Amritsar massacre, as well as responses preceding and succeeding it, have been described by some historians as the end result of a concerted plan of response from the Punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy. James Houssemayne Du Boulay is said to have ascribed a direct relationship between the fear of a Ghadarite uprising {{in the midst of an}} increasingly tense situation in Punjab, and the British response that ended in the massacre.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} the Allied failure were mostly political. De Gaulle <b>had</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> {{he would be able}} to persuade the Vichy French at Dakar to change sides, but this turned out not to be the case, which damaged his {{standing}} with the Allies.|$|R
