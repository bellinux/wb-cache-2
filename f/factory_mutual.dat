50|$|Several {{different}} agencies develop {{standards for}} intrinsic safety, and evaluate products for compliance with standards. Agencies may {{be run by}} governments or may be composed of members from insurance companies, manufacturers, and industries {{with an interest in}} safety standards. Certifying agencies allow manufacturers to affix a label or mark to identify that the equipment has been designed to the relevant product safety standards. Examples of such agencies in North America are the <b>Factory</b> <b>Mutual</b> Research Corporation, which certifies radios, Underwriters Laboratories (UL) that certifies mobile phones, and in Canada the Canadian Standards Association. In the EU the standard for intrinsic safety certification is the ATEX directive, while in other countries around the world the IECEx standards are followed. To facilitate world trade, standards agencies around the world engage in harmonization activity so that intrinsically safe equipment manufactured in one country eventually might be approved for use in another without redundant, expensive testing and documentation.|$|E
50|$|Plank and beam {{construction}} or framing {{is a type}} of framing with no joists but widely spaced beams spanned by heavy planks. This method developed in the early 19th century for industrial mill floors but may also be found in timber framed roofs. Also known as Slow burning construction, mill construction, and heavy timber {{construction or}}iginated in industrial mills in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The joists are eliminated by the use of heavy planks saving time and strength of the timbers because the joists notches were eliminated. The beams are spaced 4 ft to 18 ft apart and the planks are 2 in or more thick possibly with another layer of 1 in on the top as the finished flooring could span these distances. The planks may be laid flat and tongue and grooved or splined together or laid on edge called a laminated floor. The name slow burning construction was coined in 1870 by <b>Factory</b> <b>Mutual</b> insurance company because large, smooth timbers with chamfered edges ignite slower and last longer in a fire allowing fire suppression crews more time to extinguish a fire. These beams are designed to be self-releasing in case of fire, that is if they burn through and collapse the connection with the masonry wall and joint at the post should allow the beam to fall away without pulling the wall or post down. A common way to join a beam and a masonry wall in this regard is a fire cut, an angled cut {{on the end of the}} beam.|$|E

As it turned out management took an interest, due {{in no small measure}} to altruistic motives of individual FM personnel. In a 1971 internal memorandum from Approvals Manager Eugene Cray to Vice President Jack Rhodes, Cray reported an increase in requests for fire alarm systems, in direct proportion to public and government officialsâ growing concern over the appalling loss of life resulting from home fires. Cray recommended that FM Approvals move into the home fire alarm certification business.

Within weeks a new residential approval category was authorized by management and, with technical assistance from Rexford Wilson, tests of the Statitrol SmokeGard Model 700 were undertaken. FM approval was achieved in 1972. At about the same time, SmokeGard made its retail debut in the Sears & Roebuck Spring Catalog at a list price of $ 37.88.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, {{flammability}} parameters {{associated with}} the igni-tion, combustion, and fire propagation processes and their usefulness {{for the development of}} fire resistant materials are discussed. The flammability param-eters discussed are: (a) Critical Heat Flux (CHF) and Thermal Response Param-eter (TRP), associated with ignition, (b) Heat Release Parameter (HRP) and Fire Propagation Index (FPI), associated with combustion and fire propagation. The CHF, TRP, and HRP values can be derived from the data measured in the most commonly used apparatuses: (1) the Ohio State University (OSU) Heat Release Apparatus, (2) the <b>Factory</b> <b>Mutual</b> Research Corporation (FMRC) Flammability Apparatus, and (3) the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Flame Spread Apparatus (LIFT) and the Cone Calorimeter. The OSU and FMRC Apparatuses and the Cone Calorimeter generate very similar data for ignition and heat release rate for small horizontal and vertical samples under simulated fire conditions. The NIST LIFT and the FMRC Ap-paratuses generate very similar data for lateral, upward and downward fire propagation for slabs and cylinders under simulated fire conditions. The FMRC Apparatus is also used to perform Flame Radiation Scaling experiments to de-termine the range of flame radiative and convective flame heat fluxes trans-ferred to the surface during combustion in small- to large-scale fires, pertinent to the interior material fire scenarios leading to flashover.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Halon 1301 flame {{extinction}} results are discussed for the com-bustion of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), eight composite materials, and carbon {{in the gas}} phase. Two types of combustion and {{flame extinction}} experi-ments were performed: (1) in the <b>Factory</b> <b>Mutual</b> Research Corporation (FMRC) flammability apparatus (50 kW scale) for PMMA and composite materials, and (2) in the FMRC electrical arc apparatus for carbon in the gas phase. For char forming composite materials, mass transfer from the surface was low, turbulent diffusion flames were not generated, and flame extinction oc-curred between 3 to 4. 5 % of Halon 1301, close to the value reported for the lam-inar diffusion flames of polymers. For non-charring PMMA, mass transfer from the surface was high, flames were turbulent, and flame extinction was found at about 6 % of Halon 1301, contrary to the accepted value of about 4 % for the lam-inar diffusion flames of polymers. With Halon 1301 the conditions for flame in-stability and extinction for combustion efficiency less than about 0. 40, with sig-nificant increase in the amounts of products of incomplete combustion (such as CO and hydrocarbon), were in agreement with flame instability and extinction found for fuel-rich conditions inside well-ventilated laminar and turbulent diffusion flames, in ceiling layers of combustion products, in enclosure fires, in ventilation-controlled buoyant diffusion flames of polymers, and for flame ex-tinction of heptane flames by water. Experiments in the FMRC electrical arc apparatus showed that in the gas phase combustion of carbon vapors generated in high energy arc, chemical heat release rate and combustion efficiency decreased with increase in Halon 1301...|$|E
40|$|Warehouse {{facilities}} {{are part of}} the backbone of American industry. The vast amounts of varying goods stored and distributed as part of American business has always driven the need for large, voluminous warehouses. And the increasing size of these facilities over the decades is very closely linked to the capabilities of and advances in fire protection knowledge and technology. Todayâs modern distribution centers easily and often exceed one million square feet in area, and the heights are ever increasing. In the 1970 âs and early 1980 âs, most warehouse facilities were built to an approximate height of 30 feet; this, at the time, was the extent of the fire protection (i. e., sprinkler) knowledge and capabilities. <b>Factory</b> <b>Mutual</b> (now FM Global) developed the early suppression fast-response (âESFRâ) sprinkler in the 1980 âs and buildings have been increasing in height ever since. Many applicable standards list multiple design criteria for various storage configurations in building with roof peaks up to 45 feet. Just recently this year, Viking released a nominal K- 28 ESFR sprinkler that is listed to protect rack storage as a ceilingonly design option (i. e., without the need of costly in-rack fire sprinkler systems) in warehouses having a maximum roof height of 48 feet, and it is unlikely that this trend will stop. The industry will continue to research and develop safe design solutions that will allow more and more storage in a cost effective method, and as such, building and fire code will likewise evolve to accommodate. However, in the meantime, architects and engineers work to design these facilities within the parameters of governing building and fire codes, and when necessary, use performance-based design approaches when the building does not fit inside the box...|$|E
40|$|A {{filtered}} progress variable {{approach is}} adopted for large eddy simulations (LES) of turbulent deflagrations. The deflagration model is {{coupled with a}} non-premixed combustion model, either an equilibrium-chemistry, mixture-fraction based model, or an eddy dissipation model. The coupling interface uses a LES-resolved flame index formulation and provides partially-premixed combustion (PPC) modeling capability. The PPC sub-model is implemented into the Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS) developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is then applied {{to the study of}} explosive combustion in confined fuel vapor clouds. Current limitations of the PPC model are identified first in two separate series of simulations: 1) a series of simulation corresponding to laminar flame propagation across homogeneous mixtures in open or closed tunnel-like configurations; and 2) a grid refinement study corresponding to laminar flame propagation across a vertically-stratified layer. An experimental database previously developed by FM Global Research, featuring controlled ignition followed by explosive combustion in an enclosure filled with vertically-stratified mixtures of propane in air, is used as a test configuration for model validation. Sealed and vented configurations are both considered, with and without obstacles in the chamber. These pressurized combustion cases present a particular challenge to the bulk pressure algorithm in FDS, which has robustness, accuracy and stability issues, in particular in vented configurations. Two modified bulk pressure models are proposed and evaluated by comparison between measured and simulated pressure data in the <b>Factory</b> <b>Mutual</b> Global (FMG) test configuration. The first model is based on a modified bulk pressure algorithm and uses a simplified expression for pressure valid in a vented compartment under quasi-steady conditions. The second model is based on solving an ordinary differential equation for bulk pressure (including a relaxation term proposed to stabilize possible Helmholtz oscillations) and modified vent flow velocity boundary conditions that are made bulk-pressure-sensitive. Comparisons with experiments are encouraging and demonstrate the potential of the new modeling capability for simulations of low pressure explosions in stratified fuel vapor clouds...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the construction industry brought the new methods of structural design, which have been introduced to engineers, although overall this phenomenon has increased building costs. A cost-effective construction {{is one of the}} major decision points during the definition of any engineering project, therefore, due to the opposing concepts of these two statements, revising design standards and codes are essential in order to provide adequate and cost-effective design requirements. A single-ply roof system is a relatively new method of roof construction that has been used in the building industry in recent decades, which seems to have undergone dramatic changes due to significant structural failures that have occurred through the years. Wind-induced damage on flat roofs is a common problem for low-rise buildings and much of this damage is initiated when the steel deck roof fails, leading to the overall roofing system collapse. The FM (<b>Factory</b> <b>Mutual)</b> design recommendations, which is a standard that recommends allowable dimensions and wind rating for the roofing products, have provided tabulated steel deck span dimensions and fasteners distance for many years. To update the FM design recommendations extensive experimental and analytical investigations are required. In the current study an experimental program was conducted at the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) on flat roofing systems, for simulating the wind uplift effect on several roofing systems samples, as recommended by FM design recommendations. A Finite Element Model (FEM) of the same roofing systems as those used in the experimental cases was developed and different loading patterns were analysed for providing a better simulation of the deflection, moments and forces responses, as measured during the experiments. The FEM was validated with the experimental results and was further employed for applying the FE analysis for more steel deck span dimensions and wind rating cases, as provided in the FM design recommendations tables. These results were reported to the Single Ply Roof Industry (SPRI) Committee where the updating of the FM design tables is currently under discussion...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 60 - 63). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Heat transfer fluids (HTFs) are extensively used in the chemical process industry and are available in wide ranges of properties. Aside from their importance, <b>Factory</b> <b>Mutual</b> Engineering and Research has reported 54 fires and explosions and $ 150 million losses due to fires involving HTFs during a recent 10 -year period [Febo and Valiulis, 1995]. The vapors of these fluids are flammable above their flash points and can cause explosions. To prevent explosions due to loss of vapor, heat transfer fluids are used as hot liquids at elevated pressures. If loss of containment does occur, the liquid will leak under pressure and may disperse as a fine aerosol mist. Though it has been recognized that aerosol mists can explode, very little is known about their flammability. Therefore, research is critically needed to measure aerosol properties and the flammability of fluid aerosols. This research is the first part of a study of heat transfer fluid aerosols. This part of the study focuses on dispersion and formation of heat transfer fluid aerosols from process leaks. To simulate industrial leaks, aerosol formation from a plain orifice into ambient air is studied by measuring liquid drop sizes and size distributions at various distances from an orifice. Measurements are made over ranges of temperature, pressure and orifice diameters. Aerosol drop size distributions of a HTF are measured by a non-intrusive method of analysis using a Malvern Laser Diffraction Particle Analyzer (Malvern laser). The Malvern laser employs the principle of Fraunhofer diffraction, which is light scattering. The Malvern does not require any standard to calibrate, but the laser tube must be aligned frequently to assure that the detector receives the maximum light intensity. The Malvern software converts light intensity information from the detector to drop size distributions. HTF used in this research was an alkylated aromatic received from an industrial source. The measurements were made in the horizontal direction along the center-line of the HTF spray. The effects of pressure, temperature and orifice size on fluid spray atomization and aerosol drop size distributions were studied at various distances from the orifice. Trends of drop size distributions were analyzed with respect to pressures, temperatures, and orifice sizes. The results of this research will be used in industry to help predict the behavior of fluid releases from leaks, and the information will improve the safety of heat transfer fluid handling and process safety design...|$|E
