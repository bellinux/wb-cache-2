500|$|The first {{political}} {{radio station}} was Radio Free Scotland, which illegally hijacked the sound channels of BBC television after closedown. At the time, the BBC forbade the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru to broadcast. In the 1970s, Radio Enoch, named after Enoch Powell, {{was set up}} by people on {{the right wing of the}} Conservative and Unionist Party to help re-elect a conservative government. Although Radio Enoch had vowed to return if a Labour administration was re-elected, it failed to do so after Tony Blair was elected in 1997. Other political radio broadcasters are Interference FM, set up by a collective to broadcast on the J18 demonstrations in 1999. In 1982, [...] "Our Radio" [...] was broadcasting music, anarchism, and other left wing views to London. Our Radio once evaded arrest by setting up a <b>dummy</b> <b>antenna</b> for the Home Office to find.|$|E
50|$|A {{dummy load}} is a device used to {{simulate}} an electrical load, usually for testing purposes. In radio a <b>dummy</b> <b>antenna</b> {{is connected to}} the output of a radio transmitter and electrically simulates an antenna, to allow the transmitter to be adjusted and tested without radiating radio waves. In audio systems a dummy load {{is connected to the}} output of an amplifier to electrically simulate a loudspeaker, allowing the amplifier to be tested without producing sound. Load banks are connected to electrical power supplies to simulate the supply's intended electrical load for testing purposes.|$|E
50|$|The second uniwave {{method is}} the {{absorption}} method, and it involves two tuned circuits and a single-pole, double-throw, make-before-break key. When {{the key is}} down, the arc {{is connected to the}} tuned antenna coil and antenna. When the key is up, the arc is connected to a tuned <b>dummy</b> <b>antenna</b> called the back shunt. The back shunt was a second tuned circuit consisting of an inductor, a capacitor, and load resistor in series. This second circuit is tuned to roughly the same frequency as the transmitted frequency; it keeps the arc running, and it absorbs the transmitter power. The absorption method is apparently due to W. A. Eaton.|$|E
50|$|Maiden {{flight of}} the second fully {{modified}} aircraft for the Indian Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AEW&C) was held at 1930 IST on 4 April 2012 at the San Jose dos Campos in Brazil. The necessary mission systems and components including the <b>dummy</b> AAAU (Active <b>Antenna</b> Array Unit) are successfully fitted onboard Embraer EMB 145I aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|In radio {{this device}} {{is also known}} as a <b>dummy</b> <b>antenna</b> or a radio {{frequency}} termination. It is a device, usually a resistor, used in place of an antenna to aid in testing a radio transmitter. It is substituted for the antenna while adjusting the transmitter, so that no radio waves are radiated, so that the transmitter does not interfere with other radio transmitters during the adjustments. [...] If a transmitter is tested without a load attached to its output terminals such as an antenna or a dummy load, the power will be reflected back into the transmitter, often overheating and damaging it. Also, if a transmitter is adjusted without a load, it will operate differently as compared with a load, and the adjustments may be incorrect.|$|E

This station transmitted over the top of Radio Trent on both mediumwave using 3500 watts and VHF using 800 watts or more. Mentioned in a House of Lords debate in Hansard as Radio Scargill, it was stated that it had been actively pursued and closed down by the authorities; however this was incorrect and the people involved were never caught. Other recordings of Radio Arthur are on the Pirate Archive website.|$|E
40|$|The above {{question}} might logically {{be followed}} by two additio ries: "If not, why not?'! and what then? " 'These are loaded questions. The Technician in his screened room {{as well as the}} Engineer at his desk had best tread carefully lest he bring down upon himself a barrage of counter-queries. Perhaps we can provide a few good rounds of ammunition for both sides and may the best man win. The purpose of a signal generator is to make available in the Laboratory a calibrated source of radio frequency signals which is equivalent to the antenna system with which the receiver eventually will operate. The signal generator, withthe associated <b>dummy</b> <b>antenna,</b> must therefore behave the same as the antenna system with respect to ability of the receiver to absorb energy. Failure to meet this condition invalidates the signal generator as a substitute for the antenna. Let us look briefly at an interesting situation. Failure {{to take into account the}} internal impedance of an antenna system can very easily lead to an errealizable sensitivity as compared to the. It would require a change of 4 : 1 in the antenna power of the transmitter at a fixed distance to compensate for the apparent error of 2 : 1 in the sensitivity of the receiver. Other conslderations, such as signal-td-noise ratio or selectivity, may impose contradictory requirements on the input impedance characteristics o...|$|E
