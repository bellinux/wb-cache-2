5|$|A further {{problem for}} the pair was Jackson's insistence on being around children. Though she never {{believed}} he was a pedophile—"I wouldn't have let him near my kids if I thought that"—she felt her husband was only opening <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> more rumor and innuendo following the 1993 allegations. One evening at Neverland, Presley confronted the pop star on the issue and was met with a defiant Jackson, resulting in another argument. Upon being called selfish, the male musician pointed to his humanitarian endeavors. Presley countered that his philanthropy was irrelevant, that the issue was about them.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} home to Rapallo, where on 3 May 1945, four days after Mussolini was shot, armed partisans arrived at the house to find Pound alone. He stuffed a copy of Confucius and a Chinese dictionary in his pocket before {{he was taken to}} their headquarters in Chiavari. He was released shortly afterwards, then with Olga gave <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> an American military post in the nearby town of Lavagna.|$|E

5|$|One word {{more about}} the bawdy, and I have done. I own the first night this thing was acted, some indecencies had like to have happened, {{but it was not}} my fault. The fine gentleman of the play, {{drinking}} his mistress's health in Nantes brandy from six in the morning to the time he waddled upon the stage in the evening, had toasted <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> such a pitch of vigour, I confess I once gave Amanda for gone.|$|E
5|$|Two senior nobles {{stood out}} as {{candidates}} to head Henry's regency government. The first was William, who, although elderly, was renowned {{for his personal}} loyalty and could help support the war with his own men and material. The second was Ranulf de Blondeville, the Earl of Chester {{and one of the}} most powerful loyalist barons. William diplomatically waited until both Guala and Ranulf had requested him to take up the post before assuming power. William then appointed des Roches to be Henry's guardian, freeing <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> lead the military effort.|$|E
5|$|Dynamite Headdy is an action-platform game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} Headdy, a puppet with a detachable head. The story follows Headdy in his adventures to save his world from the evil puppet King Dark Demon, who is transforming all the puppets of the world into his evil minions. To succeed, Headdy must overcome the King's army, which features the likes of Trouble Bruin and the key masters which serve as stage bosses. Headdy can jump and throw his head in any direction to attack enemies. His head {{can also be used}} to grab hooks and pull <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> other platforms. Headdy's health is represented by a spotlight in the corner of the screen which changes colors. If the player does not pick up restorative items to heal themselves after suffering damage from enemies, they will lose a life.|$|E

5|$|Xinhua News Agency {{published}} an article on 17 January 2016 stating that an individual {{by the name of}} Gui Minhai had been detained relating to a fatal traffic accident in December 2003 in which a schoolgirl died. Xinhua alleged that Gui Minhai (桂敏海), with a different but identical-sounding middle character with respect to Gui Minhai the publisher, had fled abroad under the guise of a tourist in November 2004 using a borrowed identity card following the court case; his stated age was 46 years in 2005 – a discrepancy of five years compared with the details in Gui's Swedish passport. The two discrepancies created doubts {{that there may have been}} a case of mistaken identity. Xinhua claimed that Gui gave <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> public security officials in October 2015.|$|E
5|$|Dagen awakens {{in a cage}} in an {{abandoned}} asylum and is told that his wife Joyce will die if he doesn't save her within one hour. Joyce is chained at the neck to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Dagen's progress. After he escapes the cage, which dangles over a floor of spikes, he begins searching for Joyce. Along the way, he finds Nina, his publicist, in a fish hook trap; Suzanne, his lawyer, in a piercing wheel; and Cale McNamara, his best friend and co-conspirator, in a hanging trap. They represent the three wise monkeys and are killed despite Dagen's efforts to save them. After removing his upper wisdom teeth to obtain the combination for a security door, Dagen finds Joyce and is forced to reenact the trap {{he claimed to have}} survived: he must drive hooks through his pectoral muscles and hoist <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the ceiling to deactivate her trap. He fails nonetheless, and is forced to watch as a brazen bull capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her to death.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{agreement}} and subsequent ceasefire, relations between Kagame and the Congolese government have remained tense. A 2003 United Nations report alleged that Rwanda was using demobilised soldiers {{to continue its}} illegal exploitation of Congolese minerals. Meanwhile, Kagame blamed Kabila for failing to suppress Hutu rebels in North and South Kivu provinces. Two major insurgencies {{have occurred in the}} eastern provinces: the first, from 2005 to 2009, was led by Congolese Tutsi Laurent Nkunda, while the second, carried out by the March 23 Movement (M23) under leader Bosco Ntaganda, began in 2012; Ntaganda gave <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the International Criminal Court in early 2013, and peace talks have taken place, but as of May 2013 the conflict is at risk of resuming. Human Rights Watch alleges that both insurgencies were supported by Rwanda, a charge Kagame denies. A leaked United Nations report in 2012 also alleges Rwandan support for M23; this report cites Kagame's defence minister James Kabarebe as being effectively the commander of the movement.|$|E

25|$|Marino gave <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{literary}} studies, {{love affairs}} {{and a life}} of pleasure so unbridled that he was arrested at least twice.

25|$|April 16 saw {{the fiercest}} {{exchange}} of fire near the building {{since the beginning}} of the siege. One Palestinian was wounded in the stomach and another suffered from epilepsy. They were evacuated to a hospital. Two Japanese tourists wandered into the church perimeters by mistake, and were rescued by journalists. One sixteen-year-old Palestinian, Jihad Abu-Qamil, ran away from the church and gave <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the IDF.|$|E

25|$|Sadik Beg soon repented {{of having}} {{asked for a}} Khoja, and {{eventually}} marched against Kashgar, which by this time had succumbed to Buzurg Khan and Yakub Beg, but was defeated and driven back to Khokand. Buzurg Khan delivered <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> indolence and debauchery, but Yakub Beg, with singular energy and perseverance, made himself master of Yangi Shahr, Yangi-Hissar, Yarkand and other towns, and eventually became sole master of the country, Buzurg Khan proving himself totally unfit for the post of ruler.|$|E
25|$|According to Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrrhus, Simeon {{developed}} a zeal for Christianity {{at the age}} of 13, following a reading of the Beatitudes. He entered a monastery before the age of 16. Simeon was so obsessed with Christianity, he almost gave his body away to God. From the first, he gave <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the practice of an austerity so extreme and to all appearance so extravagant, that his brethren judged him to be unsuited to any form of community life. They asked Simeon to leave the monastery.|$|E
25|$|With {{the death}} of Pope Celestine in January 1198, the {{conflict}} entered a short lull until the new pope, Innocent III, had brought <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> date, but then the conflict was further escalated. In October, Innocent III placed Norway under interdict and in letters to Eirik accused Sverre of forgery. He also sent letters to admonish neighboring kings to dispossess Sverre. They did the contrary: Sweden continued actively to support the Birkebeiners and John of England sent mercenaries to help Sverre. In 1200 Innocent {{found it necessary to}} warn the Archbishop of Canterbury not to accept further gifts from Sverre.|$|E

25|$|In February 1945, Bayramov {{fought in}} the East Prussian Offensive. On 10 February, during the battle for Neumarkt train station, he {{reportedly}} killed more than 12 German soldiers with a machine gun and his bayonet. With two others he reportedly destroyed a machine gun that was blocking the advance. During the fighting, he reportedly killed several dozen German soldiers and the soldiers under his leadership repulsed five counterattacks. After being wounded twice, Bayramov was surrounded and reportedly blew <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> avoid capture. He was buried near Neumarket. On 10 April, Bayramov was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} squat/Western toilet also exists, where a seat can be flipped {{down over}} a squat toilet, and the toilet {{can be used}} essentially {{the same way as}} the Western style. This hybrid seems to be common only in rural areas for the benefit of resident foreigners. Adapters that sit on top of the Japanese toilet to convert it to a functional sit-down toilet are much more common. There are also permanently installed extensions available to convert a squat toilet into a Western-style washlet. Inversely, there also exists a conversion platform available, that allows someone who prefers a squat toilet to raise <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the level of a Western toilet.|$|E
25|$|Augustine-Clémence Audouard {{was born}} on 21 April 1830 in Nantes, Brittany, the only {{daughter}} of Augustin-René Royer and Joséphine-Gabrielle Audouard. When her parents married seven years later her name was changed to Clémence-Auguste Royer. Her mother was a seamstress from Nantes while her father came from Le Mans and was an army captain and a royalist legitimist. After {{the failure of a}} rebellion in 1832 to restore the Bourbon monarchy the family were forced to flee to Switzerland where they spent 4 years in exile before returning to Orléans. There her father gave <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the authorities and was tried for his part in the rebellion but was eventually acquitted.|$|E
