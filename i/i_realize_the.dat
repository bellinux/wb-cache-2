[...] Ebert also wrote that [...] "If some of the characters are less than compelling, perhaps that's inevitable" [...] {{because it is the}} opening film in the new trilogy. He concluded his review by saying that rather than Star Trek films, filmmakers could [...] "ive me transparent underwater cities and vast hollow senatorial spheres any day." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B" [...] grade and complimented Liam Neeson's performance and the action scenes. In an Entertainment Weekly review for the DVD release, Marc Bernardin gave the film a [...] "C-", calling it [...] "haplessly plotted, horribly written, and juvenile". ReelViews' James Berardinelli wrote:Looking at the big picture, in spite of all its flaws, The Phantom Menace is still among the best [...] "bang for a buck" [...] fun that can be had in a movie theater. It isn't as fresh as the original Star Wars nor does it have the thematic richness and narrative complexity of The Empire Strikes Back, but it is a distinct improvement over Return of the Jedi. In fact, after Return of the Jedi, I didn't have a burning desire to return to this galaxy 'far, far away', but, with The Phantom Menace, Lucas has revived my interest.
