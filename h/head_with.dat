5|$|Sabina {{ran out of}} {{the house}} with a hammer, {{periodically}} hitting herself over the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> it. A passing motorist, Joshua Grattage, saw this extraordinary behaviour and decided to tackle her in an attempt {{to take control of the}} hammer. While wrestling with Grattage, Sabina took a roof tile out of her pocket and struck him on the back of the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> it, stunning him temporarily.|$|E

5|$|Gillan is {{a passionate}} {{football}} fan, supporting Queens Park Rangers. He {{is also a}} big fan of cricket. He is also known for his intolerance of aggressive crowd security personnel at concerts.

5000|$|Martin {{often was}} billed as [...] "Mads Maddest Artist." [...] Whereas other {{features}} in Mad, recurring or otherwise, typically were <b>headed</b> <b>with</b> pun-filled [...] "department" [...] titles, Martins work always was <b>headed</b> <b>with</b> only his name—"Don Martin Dept."—further fanfare presumably being unnecessary.|$|R
25|$|The drum {{head has}} the most effect on how a drum sounds. Each type of drum head serves its own musical purpose and has its own unique sound. Double-ply drumheads dampen high {{frequency}} harmonics because they are heavier and they are suited to heavy playing. Drum <b>heads</b> <b>with</b> a white, textured coating on them muffle the overtones of the drum head slightly, producing a less diverse pitch. Drum <b>heads</b> <b>with</b> central silver or black dots tend to muffle the overtones even more. And drum <b>heads</b> <b>with</b> perimeter sound rings mostly eliminate overtones (Howie 2005). Some jazz drummers avoid using thick drum heads, preferring single ply drum heads or drum <b>heads</b> <b>with</b> no muffling. Rock drummers often prefer the thicker or coated drum heads.|$|R
5|$|In 2005, DiCaprio's {{face was}} {{severely}} injured when model Aretha Wilson hit {{him over the}} <b>head</b> <b>with</b> a broken bottle at a Hollywood party. After pleading guilty in 2010, Wilson was sentenced to prison for two years.|$|E
5|$|It {{is at this}} point, {{with the}} {{questioning}} of Acoli, that the accounts of the confrontation begin to differ (see the witnesses section below). However, in the ensuing shootout, Trooper Foerster was shot twice in the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> his own gun and killed, Zayd Shakur was killed, and Assata Shakur and Trooper Harper were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Next, Team Canada (A-1, Bobby Roode, Eric Young, and Petey Williams) were {{pitted against}} the 4Live Kru (B.G. James, Kip James, Konnan, and Ron Killings) in an Eight-Man Tag Team match. Coach Scott D'Amore {{accompanied}} Team Canada to the ring. The {{duration of the}} encounter was 7 minutes and 18 seconds. Despite the match being contested under disqualifications and count-outs, Konnan used his shoe as a weapon during the match. Roode won the bout for his team by pinning Kip after Konnan betrayed his teammates and bashed Kip over the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> a steel chair. After the match, Konnan also bashed B.G. over the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> the chair before leaving the ring.|$|E

5|$|The Great Khali faced Hornswoggle in {{the next}} {{scheduled}} match. At one point, Hornswoggle tried to hit Khali with a shillelagh, but Khali slapped Hornswoggle down to the mat. The match ended via disqualification, after Finlay, Hornswoggle's original caretaker, entered the ring and hit Khali in the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> his own shillelagh.|$|E
5|$|The female is plumaged {{like the}} male, but is duller {{and has a}} grey <b>head</b> <b>with</b> a {{different}} pattern from the male, though it bears {{a hint of the}} pale head markings of the male. The juvenile is like the female, but young males have black markings on the head from an early age.|$|E
5|$|Adrienne's head {{is split}} open by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's <b>head,</b> <b>with</b> pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached {{to either side}} {{so it could be}} pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.|$|E

5|$|After a lacuna in the {{manuscript}} of the poem, Hymiskviða abruptly picks up again with Thor and Hymir in a boat, out at sea. Hymir catches a few whales at once, and Thor baits his line {{with the head of}} the ox. Thor casts his line and the monstrous serpent Jörmungandr bites. Thor pulls the serpent on board, and violently slams him in the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> his hammer. Jörmungandr shrieks, and a noisy commotion is heard from underwater before another lacuna appears in {{the manuscript}}.|$|E
5|$|Altar N {{is another}} small {{rhyolite}} sculpture stylistically similar to Altar M. This sculpture has {{the form of}} a turtle shell with a skeletal <b>head</b> <b>with</b> a mirror on its forehead emerging sideways from one end and an elderly figure from the other. This is a representation of the bicephalic deity Pawatun (GodN), a prominent underworld deity.|$|E

Sumatran orangutans have more sparse and lighter-coloured coats. The orangutan has a large <b>head</b> <b>with</b> a prominent mouth area. Though largely hairless, their faces can develop some hair in males, giving them a moustache.|$|E

5|$|At SummerSlam in 1999 Jarrett faced D'Lo Brown. During the match, Debra and Brown's former tag-team partner Mark Henry {{interfered}} on Jarrett's behalf, {{allowing him}} to win both the European Championship and the Intercontinental Championship. The following night, Jarrett awarded Henry the European title and gave Debra an assistant, Miss Kitty. At Unforgiven on September 26, Debra turned on Jarrett and hit him over the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> a guitar {{in the middle of}} his match against Chyna for the Intercontinental Championship. Chyna pinned Jarrett, but referee Tom Prichard overturned the decision due to Debra's involvement.|$|E
5|$|Bresnahan also {{developed}} the first batting helmet. He {{was hit in}} the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> a pitch by Andy Coakley of the Cincinnati Reds on June 18, 1907. Bresnahan was unconscious, and a Catholic priest read him his last rites. Bresnahan was hospitalized for ten days, during which time he developed schematics for a plastic batting helmet, though this piece of equipment did not become commonplace until the 1940s. Bresnahan was also the first catcher to wear a padded facemask while catching.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly larvae, caterpillars, {{have a hard}} (sclerotised) <b>head</b> <b>with</b> strong mandibles {{used for}} cutting their food, most often leaves. They have {{cylindrical}} bodies, with ten segments to the abdomen, generally with short prolegs on segments 3–6 and 10; the three pairs of true legs on the thorax have five segments each. Many are well camouflaged; others are aposematic with bright colours and bristly projections containing toxic chemicals obtained from their food plants. The pupa or chrysalis, unlike that of moths, is not wrapped in a cocoon.|$|E

5|$|Captain Broke boarded Chesapeake at {{the head}} of a party of 20men. They met little {{resistance}} from Chesapeakes crew, most of whom had run below deck. The only resistance from Chesapeake came from her contingent of marines. The British soon overwhelmed them; only nine escaped injury out of 44. Captain Broke was severely injured in the fighting on the forecastle, being struck in the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> a sword. Soon after, Shannons crew pulled down Chesapeakes flag. Only 15minutes had elapsed from the first exchange of gunfire to the capture.|$|E
5|$|Chris Benoit {{continued}} to feud with Chavo Guerrero over the WWE United States Championship. On the December 22, 2006 episode of SmackDown!, Benoit defeated Guerrero in a rematch for the title, with Vickie Guerrero accompanying Chavo to ringside. Benoit won the match by disqualification when Vickie hit Benoit in the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> the championship belt. On the January 12, 2007 episode of SmackDown!, Mr. Kennedy defeated Chris Benoit {{in a standard}} match, with help from Chavo Guerrero. The following week, Benoit defeated Chavo yet again with the championship on the line.|$|E
5|$|Doggett finally {{embraces the}} memory of his vision. Mulder tells him that when he worked in violent crimes and saw the horrible things people did, he began to think of evil like a disease that {{infected}} people. Some lack immunity to this disease of evil because of some tragedy in their lives. Jeb dies while Reyes and Katha are in the room. After the doctors leave, Katha’s eyes glow, much like Jeb's. She hits Reyes over the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> an oxygen tank and takes her gun. Before she can execute Reyes for killing her brother, Doggett appears and wrestles her to the ground.|$|E
