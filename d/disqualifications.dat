40|$|The {{ability to}} operate behind the shield of the {{corporate}} form, thereby benefiting from limited liability, {{is thought to be}} a privilege conferred by statute. This privilege is however, curtailed for certain individuals who are “proven misfits”. The removal, by <b>disqualification,</b> of these individuals from corporate management is intended to protect the shareholders and creditors of the companies concerned from the possibility of future instances of undesirable conduct by these same individuals. Thus, the Companies Act of Singapore provides for <b>disqualification</b> from holding directorships or from management of a company on a number of grounds. <b>Disqualification</b> may be automatic or dependent on a court making a <b>disqualification</b> order.

40|$|<b>Disqualification</b> of a {{governing}} body member and other persons from their positions {{in a business}} corporation Abstract The master thesis analyses the regulation of <b>disqualification</b> of directors and other persons from the management of a business corporation. The {{purpose of this study}} is to introduce in detail the grounds for <b>disqualification</b> and to define persons who might be disqualified based on each particular ground, moreover, to describe a scale of effects of a <b>disqualification</b> order and to deal with the consequences of acting while being disqualified. The attention is also drawn to several interpretative problems, which are construed. Additionally, the thesis reflects the regulation of the English Company Directors <b>Disqualification</b> Act 1986 and the relevant English case-law. Except for the introductory part and the conclusion, the thesis is divided into six chapters. The first chapter looks briefly at the <b>disqualification</b> as such and its purpose. Additionally, it is generally described, who might be disqualified. Special attention is paid to the person that is in a similar position as a director and to the influential and controlling persons. The second and the third chapters deal with particular grounds for <b>disqualification.</b> Firstly, it is focused on the <b>disqualification</b> which is pre-conditioned by [...] ...|$|R

First chapter is introductory and provides a brief introduction into the topic. Second chapter deals with the law & economics aspects of the regulation. More specifically it introduces various stakeholders in company and their interests and incentives. Third chapter focuses on the relationship between the director and the company. Further attention is paid to the managerial contract, the duty to avoid insolvent liquidation, the duty of care and the business judgement rule. Fourth chapter deals with the director's liability towards the company. Fifth chapter relates to the directors <b>disqualification.</b> In this chapter grounds for <b>disqualification</b> are dealt with as well as temporal, personal and territorial reach of the directors <b>disqualification.</b> Further attention is paid to the consequences of <b>disqualification</b> and consequences of a breach of the <b>disqualification</b> order.

As a result, Dix received his second Olympic bronze medal. Further <b>disqualifications</b> occurred in the heats of the Olympic 4×100 meter relay race: Darvis Patton and Tyson Gay misjudged a baton pass, causing the American team to be eliminated and spoiling any chance of Dix receiving a relay medal. He finished the Olympics as the only American sprinter to medal in two individual events. Dix closed the season with two sub-10 second runs at the Weltklasse and Athletissima meetings, finishing second to a Jamaican on both occasions (Bolt and Asafa Powell).|$|E

40|$|This Article {{contends that}} the {{successive}} conflict and imputed <b>disqualification</b> rules in combination are both bad law and bad ethics and that a different approach {{would be better for}} clients, for the adversary system, and for the profession. Part I of the Article analyzes the development of the successive conflict and the imputed <b>disqualification</b> doctrines. It demonstrates that two different, not always consistent, theories caused the successive conflict <b>disqualification</b> principles to develop erratically, resulting in a set of rules incompatible with either supporting rationale. Part II explains why the incorporation of that set of rules into the Model Rules of Professional Conduct leads to unreasonable results, demonstrates that successive conflict <b>disqualification</b> advances no adversary system interests, and offers alternative remedies. It suggests that the former client 2 ̆ 7 s <b>disqualification</b> gambit has become obnoxious to the reasonable operation of the civil justice system, clogging it with inappropriate <b>disqualification</b> motions that cause substantial individual and systemic damage. The Article concludes that courts should not hear, let alone grant, <b>disqualification</b> motions based on a lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s current opposition to a former client. It further urges the profession to withdraw those Model Rules concerned with successive conflict not only because they do not work well but also because they lack ethical justification...|$|R

In Barbed Wire Massacre, the ring ropes are switched with strands of barbed-wire and several weapons are featured wrapped in barbed-wire.
