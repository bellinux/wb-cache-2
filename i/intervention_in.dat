40|$|Alcohol misuse {{has been}} linked to {{negative}} organizational outcomes, including reduced productivity and increased absenteeism. Additionally, media reports have focused on alcohol misuse within sporting organizations. Given the paucity of research evaluating alcohol misuse <b>interventions</b> <b>in</b> professional sporting organizations, two systematic literature searches were conducted. Review one examined alcohol <b>interventions</b> <b>in</b> the workplace, and Review two included sport as a search term. Resultant papers demonstrated four categories of workplace alcohol interventions; brief, web based, psychosocial, and random drug and alcohol testing. Brief interventions were prevalent, yielding largely non-significant results. Review two studies evaluated a community sporting intervention, which adopted an ecological, multi-level approach, yielding significant improvements in alcohol consumption, drink-driving, and club profitability. Brief <b>interventions</b> <b>in</b> workplaces were ineffective, and no brief <b>interventions</b> were found <b>in</b> elite sporting organizations.
