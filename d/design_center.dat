40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} <b>design</b> <b>centering</b> {{problems in}} their reformulation as gen-eral semi-infinite optimization problems. The main goal of the arti-cle {{is to show that}} the Reduction Ansatz of semi-infinite programming generically holds at each solution of the reformulated <b>design</b> <b>centering</b> problem. This is of fundamental importance for theory and numerical methods which base on the intrinsic bilevel structure of the problem. For the genericity considerations we prove a new first order necessary optimality condition in <b>design</b> <b>centering.</b> Since in the course of our anal-ysis also a certain standard semi-infinite programming problem turns out to be related to <b>design</b> <b>centering,</b> the connections to this problem are studied, too...|$|R

5|$|The season premiered at the Pacific <b>Design</b> <b>Center</b> on January 26, 2017, {{ahead of}} its FX debut on February 8. It ran for eight episodes, until March 29.

40|$|Here is a {{compendium}} of fundamental problem formulations of analog <b>design</b> <b>centering</b> and sizing. It provides a differentiated knowledge about the many tasks of analog <b>design</b> <b>centering</b> and sizing. In particular, coverage formulates the worst-case problem. The book stands at the interface between process technology and design technology, detailing how the two are required to reach a solution. It presents a mathematically founded description based on numerical optimization and statistics. This volume will enable analog and mixed-signal designers to assess CAD solution methods that are presented to {{them as well as}} help developers of analog CAD tools to formulate and develop solution approaches for analog <b>design</b> <b>centering</b> and sizing...|$|R

He decided to implement a highly automated platform strategy for manufacturing. Between 1997 and 2004, Seagate reduced its headcount from approximately 111,000 to approximately 50,000, rationalized its factory footprint from 24 factories to 11 factories and reduced <b>design</b> <b>centers</b> form seven to three.
