5|$|On 8 November 2000, Smith met 21-year-old Jodie Hyde, a {{recovering}} butane gas addict from Alum Rock, Birmingham, at the Rainbow public house, {{and they were}} seen leaving together. He {{took her to a}} hospital appointment and later killed her. Prosecutors believed that he strangled her at his flat and dumped her body near a recreation ground near Golden Hillock Road in Sparkbrook, where <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>it</b> alight. The still-smouldering remains were discovered at 6:15am next morning (9 November) by two patrolling police officers. The body was barely recognisable and had to be identified using fingerprints. A subsequent post mortem concluded that she had been strangled before being rolled up in a carpet and set on fire.|$|E
5|$|The site {{chosen for}} this summer retreat {{was in a}} secluded hollow. It had {{originally}} been owned by the Marquis of Castelo Rodrigo. When the ruling Spanish were driven from Portugal in 1640, the Marquis was accused of having collaborated with the Spanish and the property was seized by the Portuguese Crown. The estate and its hunting lodge then {{became one of the}} many properties of the Portuguese king, João IV. <b>He</b> <b>set</b> <b>it</b> aside as one of the properties reserved for the second son of the reigning monarch. Thus it came into the hands of Dom Pedro, the second son of João V.|$|E
5|$|Catherine's {{earliest}} {{building project}} was the château of Montceaux-en-Brie, near Paris, which Henry II gave her in 1556, {{three years before}} his death. The building consisted of a central pavilion housing a straight staircase, and two wings with a pavilion at each end. Catherine wanted to cover the alley in the garden where Henry played pall mall, an early form of croquet. For this commission, Philibert de l'Orme built her a grotto. <b>He</b> <b>set</b> <b>it</b> on a base {{made to look like}} natural rock, from which guests could watch the games while taking refreshments. The work was completed in 1558 but has not survived. The château ceased {{to be used as a}} royal residence after 1640, and had fallen into ruin by the time it was demolished by revolutionary decree in 1798.|$|E

The tanuki transforms itself into a chagama (tea kettle) and tells the man to sell him for money.|$|R
25|$|After his consulship, Marcus Lucullus became {{governor}} (proconsul) of {{the important}} province of Macedonia. He used his tenure to lead a successful campaign against a neighboring tribe, the Thracian Bessi. In {{the course of this}} war, he advanced to the Danube and the west coast of the Black Sea where he conquered a number of Greek cities that had been bases of Mithridates VI The Great, including Apollonia, Kallatis (Callatis), Tomi, and Istros. For these achievements, he was awarded a triumph which he held in 71 BC. Part of the booty from this campaign was a colossal statue of Apollo that Marcus Lucullus took from a temple on an island near Apollonia. It may have been on the occasion of his triumph that <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>it</b> up in the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus.|$|E
500|$|Robert N.

500|$|Another American star {{provided}} by Robert L. Lippert was Margia Dean, who played Judith Carroon. A former beauty queen, Dean was allegedly cast {{on account of}} her association with the 20th Century Fox president, Spyros Skouras. According to executive producer Michael Carreras, [...] "Skouras had a girlfriend who was an actress and he wanted her in pictures, but he didn't want her in pictures in America, because of the tittle-tattle or whatever, so <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>it</b> up though his friend Bob Lippert". Val Guest recalled of her, [...] "She was a sweet girl, but she couldn't act". Her American accent was considered {{out of place in}} the film and so her lines were dubbed in post production.|$|E

500|$|Walton's {{house in}} London was {{destroyed}} by German bombing in May 1941, after which {{he spent much of}} his time at Alice Wimborne's family house at Ashby St Ledgers in the countryside of Northamptonshire in the middle of England. While there, Walton worked on projects that had been in his mind for some time. In 1939 he had been planning a substantial chamber work, a string quartet, but <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>it</b> aside while composing his wartime film scores. In early 1945 he turned again to the quartet. Walton was conscious that Britten, with Les Illuminations (1940), the Sinfonia da Requiem (1942), and Peter Grimes in 1945, had produced a series of substantial works, while Walton had produced no major composition since the Violin Concerto in 1939. Among English critics and audiences, the Violin Concerto was not at first rated one of Walton's finest works. Because Heifetz had bought the exclusive rights to play the concerto for two years, it was not heard in Britain until 1941. The London premiere, with a less famous soloist, and in the unflattering acoustics of the Royal Albert Hall, did not immediately reveal the work as a masterpiece. The String Quartet in A minor, premiered in May 1947, was Walton's most substantial work of the 1940s. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, calls it one of his finest achievements and [...] "a sure sign that he had thrown off the trammels of his cinema style and rediscovered his true voice." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{finishing}} September, September, Foote resumed work on Two Gates to the City, {{the novel}} {{he had set}} aside in 1954 to write the Civil War trilogy. The work still gave him trouble and <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>it</b> aside once more, {{in the summer of}} 1978, to write [...] "Echoes of Shiloh", an article for National Geographic Magazine. By 1981, he had given up on Two Gates altogether, though he told interviewers for years afterward that he continued to work on it.|$|E

2500|$|The Shabbat, {{according}} to Ezekiel 20:12 is God's sign ("ot") between Him and His people. It states, [...] "Moreover also I gave them my shabbats, to {{be a sign}} between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them." [...] The Shabbat was instituted on the seventh day of creation for all mankind, and God did three things as our example in Genesis 2:1-3... 1) He rested from all work, 2) He blessed the Shabbat, and 3) God sanctified the seventh day, which means <b>He</b> <b>set</b> <b>it</b> apart for only Holy use. [...] The ten commandments in Exodus 20:8-12 explain further that, [...] "six days shall you labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Shabbat of the Lord your God, in that day you shall do no work".|$|E
2500|$|During {{the period}} when a {{suitable}} story was being sought for what became Aida, Ricordi had come across Boito's partly finished libretto of his own opera Nerone, and he even suggested in a letter of February 1870 to Verdi that, with Boito's permission, <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>it</b> to music. [...] Verdi ignored it, and so Ricordi tried again in January 1871, enclosing with his letter a copy of Boito's libretto for Boito's friend and collaborator [...] Franco Faccio's Amleto which had been given in 1865 and was revived in February 1871. [...] Nothing came of this approach, although Ricordi persevered in various ways, as seen by the composer's gruff response to the publisher's statement [...] "The whole salvation of the theatre and the art is in your hands" [...] when Verdi wrote in April 1875 that [...] "I cannot take it as but a joke", continuing with [...] "Oh no, never fear, composers for the theatre will never be lacking".|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, in {{response}} to criticism from a historian Ron Radosh, a former Trotskyite who now writes for the conservative National Review—Seeger wrote a song condemning Stalin, [...] "Big Joe Blues": [...] "I'm singing about old Joe, cruel Joe. / He ruled with an iron hand. /He {{put an end to}} the dreams / Of so many in every land. / He had a chance to make / A brand new start for the human race. / Instead <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>it</b> back / Right in the same nasty place. / I got the Big Joe Blues. / Keep your mouth shut or you will die fast. / I got the Big Joe Blues. / Do this job, no questions asked. / I got the Big Joe Blues."

2500|$|In the 1930s and 1940s, it was sung to {{a slower}} tune. In 1945, {{while working in}} Mumbai with IPTA (Indian Peoples Theater Association), the sitarist Pandit Ravi Shankar was asked to compose the music for the K.A. Abbas movie [...] Dharti ka Laal and the Chetan Anand movie Neecha Nagar. During this time, Ravi Shankar was asked to compose music for the song Saare jahan se accha. In an {{interview}} in 2009 with Shekhar Gupta, Ravi Shankar recounts that {{he felt that the}} existing tune was too slow and sad. To give it a more inspiring impact, <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>it</b> to a stronger tune which is today the popular tune of this song, which they then tried out as a group song. It was later recorded by the singer Lata Mangeshkar to an 3rd altogether different tune. [...] Stanzas (1), (3), (4), and (6) of the song became an unofficial national song in India, and the Ravi Shankar version was adopted as the official quick march of the Indian Armed Forces.|$|E
2500|$|Brumel is {{best known}} for his masses, the most famous of which is the twelve-voice Missa Et ecce terræ motus. [...] Techniques of {{composition}} varied throughout his life: [...] he sometimes used the cantus firmus technique, already archaic by the end of the 15th century, and also the paraphrase technique, in which the source material appears elaborated, and in other voices than the tenor, often in imitation. [...] He used paired imitation, like Josquin, but often in a freer manner than the more famous composer. [...] A relatively unusual technique he used in an untitled mass was to use different source material for each of the sections (mass titles are taken from the pre-existing composition used as their basis: [...] usually a plainchant, motet or chanson: [...] hence the mass is without title). [...] Brumel wrote a Missa l'homme armé, as did so many other composers of the Renaissance: [...] appropriately, <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>it</b> as a cantus firmus mass, with the popular song in long notes in the tenor, to make it easier to hear. [...] All of his masses, with the exception of the highly unusual 12-voice Missa Et ecce terræ motus, are for four voices.|$|E
2500|$|Rich's {{destructive}} personal behavior famously culminated at the CMA {{awards ceremony}} for 1975, when he presented {{the award for}} Entertainer of the Year, while visibly intoxicated. After stumbling through {{the names of the}} nominees, Rich clumsily tore open the envelope, took out a cigarette lighter, and lit the paper on fire with the winner's name. While the paper burned, he announced that the winner of the award was [...] "My friend Mr. John Denver." [...] Some considered it an act of rebellion against the Music Row-controlled Nashville Sound. But many speculated that Rich's behavior was a protest against the award going to Denver, whose music Rich had considered too [...] "pop" [...] and not enough [...] "country". Others, including industry insiders, were outraged, and Rich had trouble having hits throughout 1976, and only had one top-ten with [...] "Since I Fell For You". In a 2016 interview, former CMA Executive Director Jo Walker-Meador speculated that Rich's drunkenness may have been in part due to resentment over his being shut out of the nominations that year, after his success at the 1974 awards. His son Charlie, Jr., says on his website: [...] "...why did he do it? I'll tell you why I thought he did it. #1 He thought it would be funny. <b>He</b> <b>set</b> <b>it</b> up by talking about how the potential winners were probably nervous, as he had been the previous year. #2 Bad judgement. He had recently broken his foot in a freak accident at his home in Memphis. It sounds funny, but he got his foot caught in an awkward position while getting out of a reclining chair. He cracked several bones in his foot. So...Due to the pain, he took pain medication the night of the show: Bad idea! Secondly, he and another country star got to drinking gin and tonics while waiting in the dressing room. The show was long, so by the time Dad was supposed to go on, the drinks on top of the medication got him buzzed. So, there ya' go. That's why I think he did it. Primarily {{he thought it would be}} funny. I know the last thing my father would have wanted to do was set himself up as judge of another musician. He felt badly that people thought it was a statement against John Denver." ...|$|E
