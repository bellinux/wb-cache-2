2500|$|The wings {{themselves}} are sometimes {{said to be}} highly modified (tracheal) gills. And {{there is no doubt}} that the tracheal gills of the mayfly nymph in many species look like wings. By comparing a well-developed pair of gill blades in the naiads and a reduced pair of hind wings on the adults, it is not <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> the mayfly gills (tergaliae) and insect wings have a common origin, and newer research also supports this. [...] The tergaliae are not found in any other order of insects, and they have evolved in different directions with time. In some nymphs/naiads the most anterior pair has become sclerotized and works as a gill cover for the rest of the gills. Others can form a large sucker, be used for swimming or modified into other shapes. But it doesn't have to mean that these structures were originally gills. It could also mean that the tergaliae evolved from the same structures which gave rise to the wings, and that flying insects evolved from a wingless terrestrial species with pairs of plates on its body segments: three on the thorax and nine on the abdomen (mayfly nymphs with nine pairs of tergaliae on the abdomen exist, but so far no living or extinct insects with plates on the last two segments have been found). If these were primary gills, it would be a mystery why they should have waited so long to be modified when we see the different modifications in modern mayfly nymphs.|$|E

In this article, I shall attempt to answer how important the role of cultural factors was in bringing about the general change of image of contemporary Asian communities and economies. After making a few preliminary comments on the theoretical relations between culture and development, I shall proceed to indicate some basic elements of both scientific and political discourse, concerning a concept of the so-called Asian values, which is presented as an example of a highly-ideological attempt at contrasting the two following cultural and social contexts: Asian and Western.

40|$|AbstractH+-ATP synthase is the {{dominant}} ATP production site in mitochondria and chloroplasts. So far, dimerization of ATP synthase has been observed only in mitochondria by biochemical and electron microscopic investigations. Although the physiological relevance remains still enigmatic, dimerization was proposed to be a unique feature of the mitochondrion [Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1555 (2002) 154]. It is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine,</b> however, <b>that</b> closely related protein complexes of mitochondria and chloroplast should show such severe differences in structural organization. We present the first evidences for dimerization of chloroplast ATP synthases within the thylakoid membrane. By investigation of the thylakoid membrane of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, dimerization of the chloroplast ATP synthase was detected. Chloroplast ATP synthase dimer dissociates into monomers upon incubation with vanadate or phosphate but not by incubation with molybdate, while the mitochondrial dimer is not affected by the incubation. This suggests a distinct dimerization mechanism for mitochondrial and chloroplast ATP synthase. Since vanadate and phosphate bind to the active sites, contact sites located on the hydrophilic CF 1 part are suggested for the chloroplast ATP synthase dimer. As the degree of dimerization varies with phosphate concentration, dimerization might be a response to low phosphate concentrations...|$|R

It is an open question whether a similar sorting occurs with respect to workers’ perceptions of control.

Every eight miles or so was the country town, where lawyer, corn merchant, wool-stapler, saddler, veterinary surgeon, doctor, draper, milliner and so forth lived. Every eight miles--simply because that eight mile marketing journey, four there and back, was as much as was comfortable for the farmer. But directly the railways came into play, and after them the light railways, and all the swift new motor cars that had replaced waggons and horses, and so soon as the high roads began to be made of wood, and rubber, and Eadhamite, and all sorts of elastic durable substances--the necessity of having such frequent market towns disappeared.
