40|$|The {{anomalous}} {{properties of}} the <b>Hall</b> <b>constant</b> in the normal state of high-$T_c$ superconductors are investigated within the single-band Hubbard model. We argue that the Mori theory is the appropriate formalism to address the <b>Hall</b> <b>constant,</b> since it aims directly at resistivities rather than conductivities. More specifically, the frequency dependent <b>Hall</b> <b>constant</b> decomposes into its infinite frequency limit and a memory function contribution. As a first step, both terms are calculated perturbatively in $U$ and on an infinite dimensional lattice, where $U$ is the correlation strength. If we allow $U$ {{to be of the}} order of twice the bare band width, the memory function contribution causes the <b>Hall</b> <b>constant</b> to change sign as a function of doping and to decrease as a function of temperature.

40|$|The {{anomalous}} {{frequency and}} doping {{dependence of the}} <b>Hall</b> <b>constant</b> in the normal state of high-T_c superconductors are investigated within models of strongly correlated electron systems. In Mori theory, the transition of the <b>Hall</b> <b>constant</b> from infinite to zero frequency is described by a memory function. It naturally introduces a second time scale, that, within the t-J model, is identified with the spinon relaxation time of Anderson. This provides us with a phenomenological understanding of the interplay between the frequency and temperature dependence of the <b>Hall</b> <b>constant</b> for frequencies below the Mott-Hubbard gap. Within the single-band Hubbard model in the limit U≫ t, the memory function is calculated via its moments and shown to project out the high-energy scale U. This causes the <b>Hall</b> <b>constant</b> to decrease by a factor (1 +δ) / 2 (δ: doping), when the frequency is lowered from infinity to values within the Mott-Hubbard gap. Finally, it is outlined, how the <b>Hall</b> <b>constant</b> may be calculated in the low frequency regime. Comment: 10 PRB pages, to appear in PRB together with cond-mat/ 960617...|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} results of certain {{integrations}} of quantum-theoretic interest, relying, in this regard, upon recently developed parameterizations of Boya et al of the n x n density matrices, in terms of squared components of the unit (n- 1) -sphere and the n x n unitary matrices. Firstly, we express the normalized volume elements of the Bures (minimal monotone) metric for n = 2 and 3, obtaining thereby "Bures prior probability distributions" over the two- and three-state systems. Then, as an essential first step in extending these results to n > 3, we determine that the "Hall normalization constant" (C_{n}) for the marginal Bures prior probability distribution over the (n- 1) -dimensional simplex of the n eigenvalues of the n x n density matrices is, for n = 4, equal to 71680 /pi^ 2. Since we also find that C_{ 3 } = 35 /pi, it follows that C_{ 4 } is simply equal to 2 ^{ 11 } C_{ 3 }/pi. (C_{ 2 } itself is known to equal 2 /pi.) The constant C_{ 5 } is also found. It too {{is associated with a}} remarkably simple decompositon, involving the product of the eight consecutive prime numbers from 2 to 23. We also preliminarily investigate several cases, n > 5, with the use of quasi-Monte Carlo integration.

40|$|Using two {{approaches}} to strongly correlated systems, the extremely correlated Fermi liquid {{theory and the}} dynamical mean field theory, we compute the transverse transport coefficients, namely the <b>Hall</b> <b>constants</b> R_H and <b>Hall</b> angles θ_H, and also the longitudinal and transverse optical response of the U=∞ Hubbard model {{in the limit of}} infinite dimensions. We focus on two successive low-temperature regimes, the Gutzwiller correlated Fermi liquid (GCFL) and the Gutzwiller correlated strange metal (GCSM). We find that the Hall angles θ_H ∝ T^ 2 in the GCFL regime, on warming into the strange metal regime, it passes through a downward bend and continues as T^ 2. Equivalently, R_H is weakly temperature dependent in the GCFL regime, and becomes strongly T-dependent in the GCSM regime. Drude peaks are found for both the longitudinal optical conductivity σ_xx(ω) and the optical Hall angles tanθ_H(ω) below certain characteristic energy scales. By comparing the relaxation rates extracted from fitting to the Drude formula, we find that in the GCFL regime there is a single relaxation rate controlling both longitudinal and transverse transport, while in the GCSM regime two independent relaxation rates emerge. We trace the origin of this behavior to the dynamical particle-hole asymmetry of the Dyson self-energy, arguably a generic feature of doped Mott insulators. Comment: 12 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

In this model Gorkov equations for s-electrons in the ferromagnetic layer remain linear and are solved easily. It is shown that Hall field E^H for both F/S and F/N contacts are step-functions of the coordinate perpendicular to the planes of the layers and have zero value in S(N) layer. The Andreev reflection increases the value of <b>Hall</b> <b>constant</b> R_s for F/S case.

Magnetic susceptibility data (χ) near and above the Curie point is also included. The different contributions to the electrical resistivity are separated out, including the spin-disorder, residual and phonon terms, the results being compared with theory. For the Hall resistivity, the normal (ρoH) and the extraordinary (ρs H) terms are obtained, with the corresponding <b>Hall</b> <b>constants</b> (R 0, Rs). Very sharp anomalies are observed both in dρ/dT and dρH/dT in the transition region, indicative of a well defined critical point in our concentrated random magnetic alloy.

The samples were synthesized by reaction in the sealed cell of weighed amounts of the spectroscopically pure, vacuum melted elements. The measurements on the PbTe and SnTe binary solid solutions were repeated and extended over a wider temperature range. A more complete characterization of the PbTe and SnTe absorption spectra was obtained. These allowed the values of the enthalpy of fusion as well as the Gibbs energy of dissociation for PbTe and SnTe to be redetermined. Enthalpies of fusion of PbTe(s) and SnTe(s) were found to be 11. 332 and 10. 921 kcal/mole, respectively. These partial pressure data allow the calculation of the partial {{pressures of}} Pb(g) and Sn(g) as well as the Gibbs energies of formation of the solid solutions.
