5|$|Studies {{investigating}} {{effects of}} the menstrual cycle on alcohol consumption have found mixed evidence.

5|$|After {{the initial}} episode, 2% may {{experience}} a further episode {{within the first}} month. After this, there is a 1% annual risk of recurrence. Those {{with high blood pressure}} and dissections in multiple arteries may have a higher risk of recurrence. Further episodes of cervical artery dissection are more common in those who are younger, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> cervical artery dissection, or have a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or fibromuscular dysplasia.|$|E
25|$|In a 2010 article, three genes {{were found}} to {{correlate}} with stuttering: GNPTAB, GNPTG, and NAGPA. Researchers estimated that alterations in these three genes were present in 9% of people who stutter who <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> stuttering.|$|E

25|$|There is {{evidence}} that narcissistic personality disorder is heritable, and individuals {{are much more likely}} to develop NPD if they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the disorder. Studies on the occurrence of personality disorders in twins determined that there is a moderate to high heritability for narcissistic personality disorder.|$|E
25|$|Women who <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> {{fraternal twins}} {{have a higher}} chance of {{producing}} fraternal twins themselves, {{as there is a}} genetically linked tendency to hyper-ovulate. There is no known genetic link for identical twinning. Other factors that increase the odds of having fraternal twins include maternal age, fertility drugs and other fertility treatments, nutrition, and prior births.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In a study {{designed}} to throw {{light on the}} natural history of asthma in Ethiopia, 91 patients living at 2500 metres and attending asthma clinics in Addis Ababa underwent spirometric and skinprick testing. Only eight had had symptoms of asthma before the age of 16. Sixty two <b>had</b> <b>a</b> history of allergic rhinitis and 16 <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> of allergic rhinitis; 33 <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> of asthma. In 30 cases asthma was worse from August to October. All patients had tried traditional remedies, usually without success; and all took modern drugs, oral combination bronchodilators being the most frequently used...|$|R

25|$|While {{the cause}} is unknown, it is {{believed}} to occur due {{to a combination of}} genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors. About seven percent of those affected <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the condition. Proposed environmental factors include rubbing the eyes and allergies. The underlying mechanism involves changes of the cornea to a cone shape. Diagnosis is by examination with a slit lamp.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} signs of {{testicular}} cancer is often a lump or swelling in the testes. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine screening for testicular cancer in asymptomatic adolescent and adults including routine testicular self-exams. However, the American Cancer Society suggests that some men should examine their testicles monthly, especially if they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> cancer, and the American Urological Association recommends monthly testicular self-examinations for all young men.|$|E
25|$|Carrier testing: Carrier {{testing is}} used to {{identify}} people who carry one copy of a gene mutation that, when present in two copies, causes a genetic disorder. This type of testing is offered to individuals who <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> a genetic disorder and to people in ethnic groups with {{an increased risk of}} specific genetic conditions. If both parents are tested, the test can provide information about a couple's risk of having a child with a genetic condition like cystic fibrosis.|$|E

25|$|There is an {{association}} between use of hormonal birth control {{and the development of}} premenopausal breast cancer, but whether oral contraceptives use may actually cause premenopausal breast cancer is a matter of debate. If there is indeed a link, the absolute effect is small. Additionally, it is not clear if the association exists with newer hormonal birth controls. In those with mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 or BRCA2, or who <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> breast cancer, use of modern oral contraceptives does not appear to affect the risk of breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis {{often can}} be made through {{clinical}} examination and urine tests (excess mucopolysaccharides are excreted in the urine). Enzyme assays (testing a variety of cells or body fluids in culture for enzyme deficiency) are also used to provide definitive diagnosis {{of one of the}} mucopolysaccharidoses. Prenatal diagnosis using amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling can verify if a fetus either carries a copy of the defective gene or is affected with the disorder. Genetic counseling can help parents who <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the mucopolysaccharidoses determine if they are carrying the mutated gene that causes the disorders.|$|E
25|$|While PMS {{is linked}} to the luteal phase, the causes of PMS are not clear, but several factors may be involved. Changes in hormones during the menstrual cycle seem to be an {{important}} factor; changing hormone levels affect some women more than others. Chemical changes in the brain, stress, and emotional problems, such as depression, do not seem to cause PMS but they may make it worse. Low levels of vitamins and minerals, high sodium, alcohol, and/or caffeine can exacerbate symptoms such as water retention and bloating. PMS occurs more often in women who are between their late 20s and early 40s; have at least 1 child; <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> depression; and have a past medical history of either postpartum depression or a mood disorder.|$|E

500|$|Family history; 5–10% of {{pancreatic}} cancer cases have an inherited component, where people <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> {{pancreatic cancer}}. The risk escalates greatly {{if more than}} one first-degree relative had the disease, and more modestly if they developed it {{before the age of}} 50. Most of the genes involved have not been identified. [...] Hereditary pancreatitis gives a greatly increased lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer of 30–40% to the age of 70. [...] Screening for early pancreatic cancer may be offered to individuals with hereditary pancreatitis on a research basis. Some people may choose to have their pancreas surgically removed to prevent cancer developing in the future.|$|E
