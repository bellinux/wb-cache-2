30|$|A dozen natural {{substances}} {{from the}} INCI list originate from {{plants that are}} on the red list of endangered species in Germany (class 2 or 3) [18], e.g. Drosera rotundifolia (sundew), Orchis morio (green-veined orchid), Gentiana lutea (<b>great</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>gentian),</b> Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (bearberry), or Arnica montana (mountain arnica). There were no notifiers of Drosera rotundifolia (sundew) and Orchis morio. Also, no notifier is entered for Arnica montana, although this plant is used frequently for pharmaceutical products. Some plants which are endangered in Germany and used for the production of natural substances may be cultivated (e.g. Gentiana lutea, Arctostaphyllos uva-ursi, and since recently also Arnica montana) or they may be collected in other countries (e.g. Arnica montana). Gentiana lutea, and Arctostaphyllos uva-ursi are notified by 747, respectively 25 notifiers. There are additional rare and protected plants, which are used for the production of personal care products, but which are itemized in the INCI list and not in the German red list. For example, alpine valerian (Valeriana celtica, German name: Speick) is used by the German Speick company for the production of soap. This company was granted an exception permit for the collection of Valeriana celtica in the Austrian Alps.|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{perception}} that the spirit is produced with gentian flowers (which are depicted in the labeling by many producers), Gentian is actually produced using gentian root, most commonly the <b>yellow</b> <b>gentian,</b> which is a larger variety. Less commonly, the roots from other flowers from the Gentian genus are used, such as the purple gentian, brown gentian, or spotted gentian. The harvesting of gentian from the wild is strictly controlled; as a result, fields are planted with the specific purpose of being harvested. In both the EU and Switzerland, the alcoholic strength of Gentian must be at least 37.5 percent alcohol by volume.|$|R
40|$|Mycopopulation of <b>yellow</b> <b>gentian</b> {{growing in}} {{plantations}} was studied in 2008 and 2009. Fourteen species of fungi were registered at seed, {{out of which}} five were pathogenic. The most common species was Alternaria alternata (72 - 74 %). Species of the genus Fusarium (F. oxysporum, F. solani and F. equiseti) were present in a small percentage (2 - 6 %). These species, as well as F. verticillioides, were isolated from root, and Fusarium sp. was isolated from the flowers. Alternaria alternate, Epicoccum purpurescens, Phoma sp. and Alternaria sp. were regularly present on the leaves and stems...|$|R
