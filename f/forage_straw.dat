The treatments consisted of planting bean crops under straw of Urochloa brizantha ‘Xaraés’ and Urochloa ruziziensis, fertilized with urea - sourced N (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg N ha - 1). The experimental design was randomized blocks with four replications, and a factorial scheme of 2 × 5. The greater yield of U. brizantha dry matter {{in the two years}} of evaluation increased bean leaf nutrient levels. The nutritional increase with increasing N application rates showed that the straw produced by the forages had a positive effect on bean nutrition. The grain yield was satisfactory but was not affected by the forage species nor by changes in the N application rates. The Urochloa straw increased the soil organic matter (SOM), Ca, and Mg content in both evaluated years, affected the decomposition and mineralization of organic residues, and ensured the proper development of the bean plants...|$|E
40|$|In India oats can {{be grown}} as fodder crops on all soils, apart from {{alkaline}} or waterlogged conditions, in all regions where wheat and barley are grown. It is mostly grown as winter crop. In addition, oats are quick growing, palatable, succulent and nutritious and acceptable to all categories of livestock. It can be fed in many forms such as green <b>forage,</b> <b>straw,</b> silage, and grains. With {{the introduction of new}} management systems (proper amounts of manure and fertilizers, multicut cultivars, better combinations such as oats + vetch and oats + peas) both commercial dairy farmers and resource-poor farmers have greatly reduced the feed shortage problem during the dry winter months as well as achieving a 30 % reduction in the cost of feed. Besides growing fodder oats as sole crop, oats + vetch is the best mixture for high yields and improved soil fertility. For resource-poor farmers, oat cultivars Canadian and Kent are recommended and a combination of oats + vetch. The general nutrient management practice is application of FYM at the rate of 5 ton/ha by broadcast uniformly and another ploughing done. 80 : 60 : 40 kg (N: P 2 O 5 : K 20) is the recommended fertilizer rate, where N was used in three split doses, applied after each cut under irrigated conditions. Otherwise it was applied as one basal dose under rainfed conditions. After sowing, a land leveler was used to ensure good seed contact with soil. To optimize the fertilizer requirement, various trials were conducted under All India Coordinate Fodder Research Project. Application of 120 kg/ha resulted higher green fodder yield of 30 t/ha. To get a maximum possible yield application of 60 kg Sulphur/ ha along with recommended dose of fertilizer can be restored. Fodder oats is also cultivated in cropping sequences like Rice-Cowpea-oats and ricesorghum- oats. Application of 75 % of recommended fertilizer along with FYM (5 t/ha) recorded maximum rice equivalent yield of 40 t/ha in the case of rice-cowpea-oats cropping sequence. So, oats has the potential to serve as an important winter fodder crop in India during winter season. With good nutrient management it can potentially provides more and better fodder from the same unit of land than the traditionally grown winter wheat. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|E

Two field experiments were initiated in 1993 and 1994 at the Agronomy Research Station in Stillwater and Perkins to estimate plant N loss from several cultivars {{as a function of}} N applied and to characterize N use efficiency (NUE). A total of five cultivars were evaluated at preplant N rates ranging from 30 to 180 kg ha- 1. Nitrogen loss was estimated as the difference between total forage N accumulated at anthesis and the total (grain + straw) N at harvest. <b>Forage,</b> grain, <b>straw</b> yield, N uptake, and N loss increased with increasing N applied at both Stillwater and Perkins. Significant differences were observed among varieties for yield, N uptake, N loss and components of NUE in <b>forage,</b> grain, <b>straw</b> and grain + straw. Estimates of N loss over this two year period ranged from 4. 0 to 27. 9 kg ha- 1 (7. 7 to 59. 4 % of total forage N at anthesis). Most N losses occurred between anthesis and 14 days post-anthesis. Avoiding excess N application would reduce N loss and increase NUE in winter wheat varieties. Varieties with high harvest index (grain yield/total biomass) and low forage yield had low plant N loss. Estimates of plant loss suggest N balance studies should consider this variable before assuming that unaccounted N was lost to leaching and denitrification...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Forage {{plants are}} the basis of {{ruminant}} nutrition. Among cereal forages, maize cropped for silage making is the most widely used. Much research in genetics, physiology, and molecular biology of cereal forages is thus devoted to maize, even if silage of sorghum or immature small-grain cereals and straws of small-grain cereals are also given to cattle. Cell wall digestibility is the limiting factor of forage feeding value and is, therefore, the first target for improving their feeding value. Large genetic variation for cell wall digestibility was proven from both in vivo and in vitro experiments in numerous species. Among the regular maize hybrids [excluding brown-midrib (bm) ones], the cell wall digestibility nearly doubled from 32. 9 % to 60. 1 %. Genetic variation has also been proven in cell wall digestibility of sorghum and wheat, barley or rice <b>forage,</b> or <b>straw,</b> with lower average values than in maize.

Moreover, forage feeding to horses can provide many of the essential nutrients and prevent nutritional disorders because forage fibers maintain gastrointestinal health and well-being of horses [2]. Increasing dietary fiber to at least 1 % of the horse’s body weight with decreasing starch and sugar levels can reduce such disorders [2]. Therefore, feeding adequate amounts of fibrous feeds is required for normal digestive system function. The study aimed to assess the nutritive value of 10 feeds (grains and forages) commonly used in horse nutrition in Mexico, {{on the basis of their}} chemical composition, in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) and in vitro gas production measurements with or without the supplementation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) at 4 mg/g DM. Fecal inoculum was obtained from 4 adult English Thoroughbred horses fed on restricted amount of concentrate and oat hay ad libitum. Substrates tested were: 6 concentrates (corn gluten meal, soybean meal, steam-rolled corn, steam-rolled barley, oat grain, and wheat bran) and 4 roughages (soybean hulls, corn stover, alfalfa hay, and oat hay).

To investigate this in 4 replicated trials, up to 12 horses were introduced into each of 2 identical stables containing a single forage, or 6 forages for 5 min. To detect novelty effects, in the first and third trials the single forage was hay. In the second and fourth, it was the preferred forage from the preceding trial. Trials were videotaped and 12 mutually exclusive behaviour patterns compared. When hay was presented as the single forage (Trials 1 and 3), all recorded behaviour patterns were significantly different between stables; e. g. during Trial 3 in the 'Single' stable, horses looked over the stable door more frequently (P< 0. 001), moved for longer (P< 0. 001), <b>foraged</b> on <b>straw</b> bedding longer (P< 0. 001), and exhibited behaviour indicative of motivation to search for alternative resources (P< 0. 001) more frequently.

In vitro true organic matter digestibility value (%) ranged from 55. 9 (Gebelcho) traditional to 65. 9 (Dosha) intercropping management practice. In vitro true dry matter digestibility (IVTDMD) value was higher (P< 0. 05) under intercropping than other management practices. Generally intercropping management gave higher net benefit and particularly intercropping the variety Dossha (41869 ETB ha- 1) gave highest net benefit as compared to the remaining variety and management practices. It can be concluded that intercropping faba bean with oats could be feasible to provide reasonable nutritive value of forages without or less affecting the faba bean grain yield in the crop-livestock production systems of Ethiopia.

40|$|Sodium {{chlorite}} {{increased the}} degradability of fibre {{from a range}} of mature grass <b>forages</b> including barley <b>straw</b> by 40 – 50 digestibility units when comparisons were made using ground (1 mm sieve) material incubated either in vitro with cellulase or in nylon bags in the rumen. However, when fed to sheep, chlorite-treated barley straw was digested to a similar degree to untreated straw (49 and 57 % respectively), but intake was significantly reduced (385 and 790 g/day respectively). The poor in vivo utilization of chlorite-treated straw coincided with high proportions of propionic to acetic acid in the rumen (0 – 85, cf. 0. 28 with untreated feed) and absence of rumen fungi. Rumen pH and ammonia concentrations were not significantly different between diets. When incubated in nylon bags in the rumen of animals fed the corresponding diet, both untreated and treated straw (< 1 mm) were well colonized with microorganisms, as measured by cystine accumulation which showed peaks on the fibres after 24 and 72 h. While large numbers of fungal sporangia were observed after 24 h incubation on digests from untreated forage, no fungi could be detected on the chlorite-treated material. Cystine accumulation on the untreated straw after 72 h was not associated with a secondary growth of fungi. Although barley straw chaff, ground (< 1 mm) after treatment with chlorite, was highly degraded in nylon bags in the rumen and with cellulase in vitro, larger particles (1 cm) suspended in nylon bags in an animal fed chlorite-treated straw actually gained weight, probably {{due in part to the}} degree of microbial colonization...|$|R
30|$|Aerobic {{processes}} of pre-treating cattle manure with composting will ensure suppression of weed seeds and pathogens. The pre-treated manure can be vermicomposted with <b>straws</b> (<b>forages)</b> with {{the aims of}} improving its nutritive value. This will increases the Nitrogen content of the vermicomposted treated straws. As evidences shows that vermicomposting reduces C:N ratio. This {{has the potential of}} feed supplement to ruminant. Vermicast can be a good source of Nitrogen to ruminant due its low C:N ratio with likely low solubility in the rumen (Bernal et al. 1993). This might reduce Nitrogen losses in the rumen and overall Nitrogen losses due to ruminant production and increases Nitrogen retention. Results from cattle manure being ensiled with straws and other agro-by-products and fed to ruminants are encouraging; likewise the performance of the animals fed ensiled cattle manure. From these, cattle manure treated with pre-composting before vermicomposting with roughages or other agro-by-products might produce similar result or even better. This may be due increase in Nitrogen content of vermicomposting products, reduction of fibre content from forages as some cellulolytic activities was observed during vermicomposting. pH value of vermicast is within the neutral range in contrast with silage products which has a lower pH value due to increase of lactic acid during silage, this may reduce rumen pH thereby reducing microbial activities, in some cases high amount of lactic acid in the rumen may lead to sub acute ruminal acidosis (SARA). The inclusion of pre- composted cattle manure can be varied from 0 to 40  % in order to ascertain the best level of inclusion for optimal performance.|$|R
40|$|To {{enhance the}} methane {{production}} from ensiled sorghum <b>forage</b> and wheat <b>straw,</b> thermal, alkaline and thermo-alkaline pre-treatments were performed in batch mode. Alkaline pretreatment {{was conducted at}} 40 °C for 24 h {{with the addition of}} 1 and 10 % gNaOH/gTS; thermal and thermo-alkaline pre-treatments at 100 °C, and 160 °C for 30 min, with and without the addition of NaOH solutions at the same dosages previously mentioned. All the pre-treatments tested led to a solubilisation of the Chemical Oxygen Demand (CODs), with a maximum concentration (around 30 - 40 % for both substrates) obtained at 40 and 100 °C with 10 % NaOH. Furthermore, a reduction of fibrous fractions was observed for both substrates. The highest lignin reduction, compared to untreated samples, was found at 100 °C with 10 % NaOH dosage (53 % and 72 % for wheat straw and sorghum, respectively). Under this pre-treatment condition a high hemicelluloses reduction yield was also found (63 % for both substrates). The highest increase in methane yield (up to 32 %), compared to untreated substrate was observed at 40 °C with 10 % NaOH for sorghum. As for wheat straw, significant increases in methane yield were observed at 40 °C with 10 % NaOH (43 %) and at 100 °C with 1 - 10 % NaOH (48 and 67 %, respectively). According to the results of the preliminary economic analysis, the pre-treatments seemed to be sustainable for both substrates, especially for wheat straw, due to a higher methane yield increased, compared to sorghum...|$|R
40|$|Samples {{of foliage}} from {{multipurpose}} leguminous trees (MPT) {{which had been}} selected as potential feed supplements for ruminants were examined for their chemical composition and in situ degradation characteristics, and were compared with alfalfa (Medicago sativa) hay and teff (Eragrostis abyssinica) straw. Organic matter (OM), acid detergent fibre (ADF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), nitrogen, neutral detergent nitrogen, acid detergent lignin (ADL), soluble phenolics, NDF-bound proanthocyanidins and in vitro digestibility were determined in Acacia angustissima, Chamaecytisus palmensis (Tagasaste), Leucaena leucocephala, two cultivars of Sesbania sesban and Vernonia amygdalina (bitter leaf). The MPT all had a nutrient content, particularly in terms of N (up to 39. 5 g available N per kg dry matter (DM) similar to alfalfa hay, which would be suitable for supplementing teff straw, which had a high fibre, but low N(4. 0 g available N per kg DM) content. In situ nylon bag digestion and in vitro gas production analyses were carried out to assess microbial degradation characteristics. The MPT were highly degradable in situ, however gas production in vitro decreased at the MPT: teff straw ratio increased in A. angustissima, indicating that antimicrobial components were present in this species. None of the chemical estimations were correlated with antimicrobial properties. It is concluded {{that some of the}} MPT tested may prove to be useful dietary supplements for ruminants receiving poor quality <b>forages</b> like teff <b>straw,</b> as has been found in other studies.

40|$|Recent {{findings}} {{have shown that}} microbial nitrogen flow and digestible energy of diets are increased when urea is combined with a slow-release urea (SRU) in diets with a starch to acid detergent fibre ratio (S:F) 4 : 1. This affect is attributable to enhanced synchrony between ruminal N availability for microbial growth and carbohydrate degradation. To verify {{the magnitude of this}} effects on lamb performance, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of combining urea and a SRU in diets containing S:F ratios of 3 : 1, 4 : 1, or 5 : 1 on performance, dietary energetics and carcass characteristics of finishing lambs. For that, 40 Pelibuey×Katahdin lambs (36. 65 ± 3 kg) were assigned to one of five weight groupings in 20 pens (5 repetition/treatments). The S:F ratio in the diet was manipulated by partially replacing the corn grain and dried distiller’s grain with solubles by <b>forage</b> (wheat <b>straw)</b> and soybean meal to reach S:F ratios of 3 : 1, 4 : 1 or 5 : 1. An additional treatment of 4 : 1 S:F ratio with 0. 8 % urea as the sole source of non-protein nitrogen was used as a reference for comparing the effect of urea combination vs. conventional urea at the same S:F ratio. There were no treatment effects on dry matter intake (DMI). Compared the urea combination vs urea at the same S:F ratio, urea combination increased (p< 0. 01) average daily gain (ADG, 18. 3 %), gain for feed (G:F, 9. 5 %), and apparent energy retention per unit DMI (8. 2 %). Irrespective of the S:F ratio, the urea combination improved the observed-to-expected dietary ratio and apparent retention per unit DMI was maximal (quadratic effect, p≤ 0. 03) at an S:F ratio of 4 : 1, while the conventional urea treatment did not modify the observed-to-expected net energy ratio nor the apparent retention per unit DMI at 4 : 1 S:F ratio. Urea combination group tended (3. 8 %, p = 0. 08) to have heavier carcasses with no effects on the rest of carcass characteristics. As S:F ratio increased, ADG, G:F, dietary net energy, carcass weight, dressing percentage and longissimus thoracis (LM) area increased linearly (p≤ 0. 02). Combining urea and a slow-release urea product results in positive effects on growth performance and dietary energetics, but the best responses are apparently observed when there is a certain proportion (S:F ratio = 4 : 1) of starch to acid detergent fibre in the diet...|$|R

Cows were fed on roughage (berseem hay, green sorghum <b>forage</b> and wheat <b>straw)</b> and concentrate. The ratio of roughage: concentrate varied in the three treatment groups from 50 : 50 (T 1); 60 : 40 (T 2); and 70 : 30 (T 3). DMI decreased with increasing the level of roughage in the diet. Digestibility of DM, CP, EE, NFE, and OM showed a significant decrease (P < 0. 05) when R:C was increased. NDF digestibility did not vary between treatment groups. On the other hand, CF and ADF digestibility were significantly (P < 0. 05) decreased with decreasing R:C. Increasing R:C significantly (P < 0. 05) decreased milk production, but production of 4 % FCM was not affected by forge level. Milk fat concentration was significantly (P < 0. 05) decreased by 6. 30 and 3. 78 % in T 1 and T 2, respectively, as compared T 3. Increasing R:C had non significant effect on milk lactose, CP, TS, SNF, MUN, Ca and P level. Milk cholesterol level in T 3 was lowered by 13. 35 and 8. 27 % as compared to T 1 and T 2, respectively.

40|$|The {{feeding of}} {{ruminants}} in the Democratic Republic of Congo {{is based on}} the use of natural vegetation. This vegetation is characterised by grasses and rarely legumes. In addition to this, the lack of legumes {{in the southern part of}} the country means that the dry season becomes longer (over 6 months). This leads farmers with the financial means, to use commercial foods, most of which are imported. Grasses which form the basis of <b>forage</b> remain as <b>straws</b> in the dry season. They have a digestibility of less than 45 %, and are very low in nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as other minerals, which further limits their feed intake (Chenost and Kayouli 1997; Jarrige 1987). The use of locally available protein banks to supplement poor foods is therefore essential. In the same region, soils are increasingly contaminated with heavy metals from mining activities. The choice of sustainable and high protein plant species should be dictated by their adaptation to environmental conditions, including high levels of heavy metals in soil. They must also be adapted to the long dry season and provide fodder throughout the year. Among the species encountered, Adenodolichos rhomboideus is the most resistant to drought and is widespread in the region (INEAC 1954). It grows on normal soil or that contaminated by heavy metals (Faucon 2009; Meerts 2008 and Tshibangu et al 2014 c). Two other species, Leucaena leucocephala and Stylosanthes guianensis are durable and are used in ruminant diets, but are neither widespread nor adapted to the contaminated soil Tshibangu et al 2014 ab. The objective of this study was to compare the use of A. rhomboideus, L. leucocephala and S. guianensis forage as a complement to grass hay on the growth of local goats at Lubumbashi.

40|$|Oats in {{a global}} context Growing and {{production}} trends Oats rank around sixth in the world cereal production statistics following wheat, maize rice, barley and sorghum. Oat grain {{has always been an}} important form of livestock feed. They are a good source of protein, fibre, and minerals but world oat grain declined as farm mechanisation increased between 1930 to 1950. Oats remain an important grain crop for people in marginal ecologies throughout the developing world, and in developed economies for specialist uses. In {{many parts of the world}} oats are grown for use as grain as well as for <b>forage</b> and fodder, <b>straw</b> for bedding, hay, haylage, silage and chaff. Livestock grain feed is still the primary use of oat crops, accounting for an average of around 74 % of the world’s total usage in 1991 to 1992 (Welch 1995). Oats are better adapted to variable soil types and can perform better on acid soils than other small grain cereals crops. They are mostly grown in cool moist climates and they can be sensitive to hot, dry weather from head emergence through to maturity. For these reasons, world oat production is generally concentrated between latitudes 35 – 65 °N, including Finland and Norway, and 20 to 46 °S. Most of the world’s production comes from spring sown cultivars, but autumn sowing is practised along the higher altitude regions, including the Himalayan Hindu Kush range and in regions where summers are hot and dry. Where winters are severe, such as in Scandinavia, northern states of the US, Canada, and higher altitude regions in the tropics, short season to mid maturing oat cultivars are generally sown. In regions with temperate climates, oats are variously spring, winter and/or autumn sown depending on regional climatic conditions, crop rotation requirements, end use and other farming practices. In warmer regions, spring type oats can are sown in autumn to avoid summer heat and drought...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} making straw briquettes. The aim {{is to examine the}} possibility of making straw briquettes directly on the field from lines arising after the passing of the combine harvester, which would save the operation of harvesting and storing straw and thus transport intensity. The basis of this work is finding straw production in the Czech Republic and its possible potential to produce briquettes. The Czech Republic is able to use for energy purposes, an average of 1. 6 million t / y of straw cereals and 900 000 t / y of rape straw. Low specific density cut straw complicated transport to incinerators or to stationary lines to produce other forms of fuel. Pressing the straw bales specific density improves, but costs associated with transport are still relatively high. Because of low specific density, straw often stored in open stacks. Not all the straw, which is not used directly in agriculture, is used for combustion. There are also other industrial uses for straw, as Ecopanels (construction), paper, various ornaments and tools (for example: baskets). Most important for the production of briquettes is the moisture content of input material, which may not exceed 15 %. The basis for obtaining briquettes directly in the field is appropriate combination of forage harvester and briquetting press, for example self-propelled briquetting press Biotruck 2000 is constructed from the Claas Jaguar. <b>Forage</b> harvester transports <b>straw</b> to the briquetting press, during transport is straw dried because of the heat from powerful engine. To briquetting is used several types of presses that are described in this thesis. The best quality briquettes are formed on the principle of screw press.

There are described here used machines, their cost, performance and energy efficiency in those parts of the thesis. In the proposed procedure is a dry indoor storage of briquettes...|$|R
