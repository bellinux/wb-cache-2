5|$|Maurice's natural {{goodness}} never wavers in the story. Unlike Shelley's Frankenstein, {{which suggests}} that environment determines a person's morality, Maurice assumes that people can be <b>innately</b> good. Maurice even forgives Dame Smithson, who stole him from his nurse. The story aims to generate sympathy in its readers. In contrast with other children's stories of its day, it lacks didacticism and draws no clear distinctions between virtue and vice.|$|E
5|$|Adult coconut crabs have {{no known}} predators {{apart from other}} coconut crabs and humans. Its large size {{and the quality of}} its meat means that the coconut crab is {{extensively}} hunted and is very rare on islands with a human population. The coconut crab is eaten by Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders and is considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac, and intensive hunting has threatened the species' survival in some areas. While the coconut crab itself is not <b>innately</b> poisonous, it may become so depending on its diet, and cases of coconut crab poisoning have occurred. For instance, consumption of the sea mango Cerbera manghas by the coconut crab may make the coconut crab toxic due to the presence of cardiac cardenolides.|$|E
5|$|Further, birds {{recall and}} avoid {{objects that are}} both {{conspicuous}} and foul-tasting longer than objects that are equally foul-tasting but cryptically coloured. This suggests that Wallace's original view, that warning colouration helped to teach predators to avoid prey thus coloured, was correct. However, some birds (inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks) also <b>innately</b> avoid conspicuously coloured objects, as demonstrated using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps, with dull green controls. This implies that warning coloration works {{at least in part}} by stimulating the evolution of predators to encode the meaning of the warning signal, rather than by requiring each new generation to learn the signal's meaning.|$|E
5|$|Stratton wrote Social Psychology for International Conduct {{for social}} science {{teachers}} {{who wanted to}} use psychology to analyze international affairs. The book's first part evaluated races. Stratton concluded the Caucasoid and Mongoloid races were <b>innately</b> more intelligent enabling them to build strong cultures. He also stated the prejudice of other people was from {{the social and political}} advantages it brought. Stratton saw nations as made up of individuals and possessing a national character similar to what individuals had. Reviewing the book in the American Journal of Sociology, Ellsworth Faris objected to the author concluding the Northern and Central Europeans were more intelligent than Southern and Eastern Europeans, noting intelligence measures correlated also with length of stay in America.|$|E
5|$|The {{second book}} is largely {{devoted to the}} {{respective}} roles of faith and philosophical argument. Clement contends that while both are important, the fear of God is foremost, because through faith one receives divine wisdom. To Clement, scripture is an <b>innately</b> true primitive philosophy which is complemented by human reason through the Logos. Faith is voluntary, and the decision to believe is a crucial fundamental step in becoming closer to God. It is never irrational, as it is founded on {{the knowledge of the}} truth of the Logos, but all knowledge proceeds from faith, as first principles are unprovable outside a systematic structure.|$|E
5|$|Some {{important}} texts {{were created}} and studied by scholars. Philosophical works written by Yang Xiong (53 BC – 18 AD), Huan Tan (43 BC – 28 AD), Wang Chong (27–100 AD), and Wang Fu (78–163 AD) questioned whether human nature was <b>innately</b> {{good or evil}} and posed challenges to Dong's universal order. The Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Tan (d. 110 BC) and his son Sima Qian (145–86 BC) established the standard model for all of imperial China's Standard Histories, such as the Book of Han written by Ban Biao (3–54 AD), his son Ban Gu (32–92 AD), and his daughter Ban Zhao (45–116 AD). There were dictionaries such as the Shuowen Jiezi by Xu Shen (c. 58 – c. 147 AD) and the Fangyan by Yang Xiong. Biographies on important figures were written by various gentrymen. Han dynasty poetry was dominated by the fu genre, which achieved its greatest prominence {{during the reign of}} Emperor Wu.|$|E
25|$|Early {{life forms}} on Earth, {{starting}} at least 3.7 billion years ago, were single-celled organisms. Such organisms (prokaryotes, protozoans, algae) multiply by fissioning into daughter cells; thus do not age and are <b>innately</b> immortal.|$|E
25|$|The Superiority of Reason Thesis has the {{following}} rationale, '"The knowledge we gain in subject area S by intuition and deduction or have <b>innately</b> {{is superior to}} any knowledge gained by sense experience". In other words, this thesis claims reason is superior to experience {{as a source for}} knowledge.|$|E
25|$|The charitra mohaniya-karma {{disturbs}} {{the right}} conduct possessed <b>innately</b> by the jiva; it hinders the soul from acting {{according to the}} religious prescriptions. The disturbance of the conduct is produced through the sixteen passions (kasaya), the six emotions with are categorised as non-passions (nokasaya) and the three sexes (veda).|$|E
25|$|All states except Arizona, Missouri, and Tennessee {{recognize}} that some categories of false statements are so <b>innately</b> harmful {{that they are}} considered to be defamatory per se. In the common law tradition, damages for such false statements are presumed and {{do not have to be}} proven.|$|E
25|$|REBT clearly {{acknowledges}} that people, {{in addition to}} disturbing themselves, also are <b>innately</b> constructivists. Because they largely upset themselves with their beliefs, emotions and behaviors, they can be helped to, in a multimodal manner, dispute and question these and develop a more workable, more self-helping set of constructs.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, {{scientific}} racism developed {{the theory of}} Aryanism, holding that Europeans ("Aryans") were an <b>innately</b> superior branch of humanity , {{responsible for most of}} its greatest achievements. Aryanism was derived from the idea that the original speakers of the Indo-European languages constituted a distinctive race or subrace of the larger Caucasian race.|$|E
25|$|The leftists had {{an uneasy}} {{relationship}} with Murray while he headed the CIO. He mistrusted the radicalism {{of some of}} their positions and was <b>innately</b> far more sympathetic to anti-Communist organizations such as the Association of Catholic Trade Unionists. He also believed, however, that making anti-Communism a crusade would only strengthen labor's enemies and the rival AFL at a time when labor unity was most important.|$|E
25|$|Although women {{excelled in}} many {{scientific}} areas during the eighteenth century, they were discouraged from learning about plant reproduction. Carl Linnaeus' system of plant classification based on sexual characteristics {{drew attention to}} botanical licentiousness, and people feared that women would learn immoral lessons from nature's example. Women were often depicted as both <b>innately</b> emotional and incapable of objective reasoning, or as natural mothers reproducing a natural, moral society.|$|E
25|$|REBT then {{generally}} {{proposes that}} many of these self-defeating cognitive, emotive and behavioral tendencies are both <b>innately</b> biological and indoctrinated early in and during life, and further grow stronger as a person continually revisits, clings and acts on them. Ellis alludes to similarities between REBT and the general semantics when explaining the role of irrational beliefs in self-defeating tendencies, citing Alfred Korzybski as a significant modern influence on this thinking.|$|E
25|$|While yet at age twelve, as {{recalled}} in his Mémoires, he experienced his first passion for a woman, an 18-year-old next-door neighbour named Estelle Fornier (née Dubœuf). Berlioz {{appears to have}} been <b>innately</b> Romantic, this characteristic manifesting itself in his love affairs, adoration of great romantic literature, as well as Shakespeare and Beethoven, and his weeping at passages by Virgil (by age twelve he had learned to read Virgil in Latin and translate it into French under his father's tutelage).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the following claims, rationalists often adopt similar stances on other aspects of philosophy. Most rationalists reject skepticism for the areas of knowledge they claim are knowable a priori. Naturally, when you claim some truths are <b>innately</b> known to us, one must reject skepticism in relation to those truths. Especially for rationalists who adopt the Intuition/Deduction thesis, the idea of epistemic foundationalism tends to crop up. This is the view that we know some truths without basing our belief in them on any others and that we then use this foundational knowledge to know more truths.|$|E
25|$|Such {{individuals}} and groups make the general argument that the Catholic Church's line on homosexuality emphasises the physical dimension of the act {{at the expense of}} higher moral, personal and spiritual goals. Gay and lesbian Catholics also feel that the practice of total, life-long sexual denial risks personal isolation. John J. McNeill writes that since gay people experience their sexual orientation as <b>innately</b> created, to believe that it is therefore a tendency towards evil would require believing in a sadistic God; and that it is preferable to believe that this element of Church teaching is mistaken in arguing that God would behave in such a way.|$|E
25|$|Many {{religious}} and philosophical traditions support {{the view that}} the soul is the ethereal substance – a spirit; a non material spark – particular to a unique living being. Such traditions often consider the soul both immortal and <b>innately</b> aware of its immortal nature, as well as the true basis for sentience in each living being. The concept of the soul has strong links with notions of an afterlife, but opinions may vary wildly even within a given religion as to what happens to the soul after death. Many within these religions and philosophies see the soul as immaterial, while others consider it possibly material.|$|E
25|$|Arguments over {{homosexuality}} were framed as formal halakhic responsa, one of {{the most}} prominent by rabbi Bradley Shavit Artson. He argued that homosexuality, as it is now understood today, was not described by the Torah nor understood by traditional rabbis. As such, one would be able to restrict the understanding of the Torah prohibition to cases not being considered today. His views were not accepted. Later, rabbi Elliot N. Dorff used similar arguments in his case for re-evaluating homosexuality. Dorff studied the issue of coercion, arguing that people who were <b>innately</b> homosexual due to biology were not to be regarded as sinning. His early papers on the subject began to gain acceptance among a minority of RA rabbis, but ultimately it was made clear that the CJLS would not accept this argument as sufficient.|$|E

Music journalists inferred that {{the album was}} inspired by or based on an unsuccessful affair in Maxwell's life. Maxwell said in an interview, [...] "I'm so <b>innately</b> romantic and always have been, and I went through this particular romantic experience and based my album on that". The album's liner notes have a dedication from Maxwell to his [...] "musze", stating [...] "I could never have done this without you".|$|E
500|$|Jardine divided opinion {{among those}} with whom he played. He could be charming and witty or {{ruthless}} and harsh, while many people who knew him believed him to be <b>innately</b> shy. David Frith describes him as a complex figure who could change moods quickly. Although he could be friendly off the field, he became hostile and determined once he stepped onto the field. At his memorial service, he was described by Hubert Ashton as being [...] "provocative, austere, brusque, shy, humble, thoughtful, kindly, proud, sensitive, single-minded and possessed of immense moral and physical courage," [...] and Frith argues that these varied qualities are easily proven by what was said about him.|$|E
500|$|Roth Cornet of IGN {{awarded the}} episode a 7.9 out of 10, {{denoting}} a [...] "good" [...] episode. She argued the episode had a [...] "cohesive, united feel", even though Jim and Darryl were {{separated from the}} main action, that [...] "past, present, and (possible) future combined together nicely", and that [...] "the emotion wasn't overplayed". However, she {{said that this was}} not the [...] "funniest episode of The Office that we've ever seen". Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode 3.5 stars out of 5, and criticized the reintroduction of Brian, saying it felt [...] "forced" [...] and that it ruined [...] "something so <b>innately</b> interesting".|$|E
500|$|According to Shani D'Cruze of the Feminist Crime Research Network, {{the fact}} that she was Irish was a {{significant}} factor in the widespread revulsion felt towards Webster in Great Britain. Many Irish people had emigrated to England since the Great Famine of 1849, but met widespread prejudice and persistent associations with criminality and drunkenness. The Irish were at worst depicted as bestial and subhuman, and there were repeated episodes of violence between Irish and English workers as well as attacks by Fenians (Irish nationalists) in England. The demonisation of Webster as [...] "hardly human", as O'Donnell put it, was of a piece with the public and judicial perceptions of the Irish as <b>innately</b> criminal.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song refer to vampires and werewolves: [...] "Run run her kiss is a vampire grin/The moon lights her way while she's howlin' at him". Gaga {{explained}} that the lines were means of expressing how people rely on external motivations to cope with internal anxiety. [...] "She doesn't feel free without the moon," [...] Gaga said. [...] "These lyrics are a {{way for me to}} talk about how I believe women and some men feel <b>innately</b> insecure about themselves all the time. It's not sometimes, it's not in adolescence, it's always." [...] The spoken interlude refers to famous people who met with a tragic end of their lives, namely Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland, Sylvia Plath, JonBenét Ramsey, Liberace, Jesus, Stanley Kubrick, and Princess Diana.|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft {{was not as}} {{receptive}} to Rousseau’s ideas as she was to Locke’s; she appropriated the aesthetic of the sublime to challenge Rousseau's ideas regarding the education of women (discussed in more detail below). During the 18th century, [...] "the sublime" [...] was associated with awe, fear, strength and masculinity. As Myers writes, [...] "to convey her message for female readers that achievement comes from within, Wollstonecraft substitutes the strength, force, and mental expansion associated with heroic sublime for the littleness, delicacy, and beauty that Rousseau and aestheticians such as Edmund Burke equate with womanhood". [...] Unlike writers such as Rousseau and Burke, who portray women as <b>innately</b> weak and silly, Wollstonecraft argues that women can indeed achieve the intellectual heights associated with the sublime.|$|E
500|$|Greenwood {{argues that}} the {{academic}} discipline of anthropology, being {{a product of the}} western rationalism developed during the Age of Enlightenment, is <b>innately</b> skeptical of claims for the existence of magic or an otherworld, either among non-western cultures or western subcultures. In contrast to this attitude, she notes that anthropology is the discipline which first pointed out that [...] "reality is culturally constructed" [...] and that there are [...] "multiple ways of experiencing the world", including those which conceive of an otherworld existing alongside our own reality. For this reason, she argues that anthropologists wishing to understand a society that believes in and practices magic must first tentatively accept the existence of an otherworld, claiming that [...] "it is inappropriate to use methods developed for the study of everyday reality to analyse the magical otherworld." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Blassingame, the Sambo figure {{evolved from}} white Americans' attitudes toward Africans and African Americans as <b>innately</b> barbaric, passive, superstitious, and childlike. Southern writers felt {{a need to}} defend slavery from {{allegations}} of abuse and brutality leveled by northern abolitionists, so Sambo became a common portrayal to justify and explain the need for plantation paternalism. Finally, slaveowners used the Sambo stereotype to alleviate their own fears and anxieties about the potential rebelliousness of their slaves. Blassingame remarks, [...] "In this regard, Nat, the actual and potential rebel, stands {{at the core of}} white perceptions of the slave. With Nat perennially in the wings, the creation of Sambo was almost mandatory for the Southerner's emotional security. Like a man whistling in the dark to bolster his courage, the white man had to portray the slave as Sambo." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite his successes, Mundhir {{was accused}} by Maurice of treason during the {{preceding}} campaign. Maurice claimed that Mundhir had revealed the Byzantine plan to the Persians, who then proceeded to destroy the bridge over the Euphrates. The chronicler John of Ephesus explicitly calls this assertion a lie, as the Byzantine intentions must have been plain to the Persian commanders. Both Maurice and Mundhir wrote letters to Emperor Tiberius, who tried to reconcile them. Finally, Maurice himself visited Constantinople, where {{he was able to}} persuade Tiberius of Mundhir's guilt. The charge of treason is almost universally dismissed by modern historians; Irfan Shahîd says that it probably {{had more to do with}} Maurice's dislike of the veteran and militarily successful Arab ruler. This was further compounded by the Byzantines' habitual distrust of the [...] "barbarian" [...] and supposedly <b>innately</b> traitorous Arabs, as well as by Mundhir's staunchly Monophysite faith.|$|E
500|$|Phillips's {{interpretation}} of slavery was challenged by Kenneth M. Stampp in The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the Ante-Bellum South (1956) and Stanley M. Elkins in Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life (1958). Stampp's study lacks the racist interpretation found in American Negro Slavery and approaches the {{issue from the}} position {{that there is no}} innate difference between blacks and whites. He questions the reality of plantation paternalism described by Phillips: [...] "the reality of ante-bellum paternalism ... needs to be separated from its fanciful surroundings and critically analyzed." [...] Elkins also dismisses Phillips's claim that African American slaves were <b>innately</b> submissive [...] "Sambos". He argues that slaves had instead been infantilized, or [...] "made" [...] into Sambos, by the brutal treatment received at the hands of slaveowners and overseers. Elkins compares the process to the infantilization of Jews in Nazi concentration camps.|$|E
500|$|The Athsheans, in contrast, {{are shown}} as an <b>innately</b> {{peaceful}} and non-aggressive people, {{at least at}} the beginning of novel. Rape and murder are virtually unknown on the planet. They have adopted a number of behaviors that preempt violence; thus when Selver has Davidson pinned down after the attack on Smith camp, he finds himself unable to kill Davidson, despite the hate he feels towards the Terran. Selver spends much of the novel reflecting on the effect that violence has on his own culture. He turns to violence, against the Athshean ethic, in order to save his culture as he sees it. However, unlike Davidson, who enjoys killing, Selver sees it as something poisoning his culture. This perception is shared by his fellow Athsheans: one of the elders of the Athsheans says to Selver [...] "You've done what you had to do, and it was not right." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{his model}} {{incorporated}} and justified the imperial government into {{the natural order}} of the universe, it appealed to Emperor Wu, who in 136 BCE abolished non-Confucian academic chairs or erudites (博士) not dealing with the Confucian Five Classics: the Classic of Poetry, the Classic of Changes, the Classic of Rites, the Classic of History, and the Spring and Autumn Annals. Expanding on the position of Mengzi (c. 372 [...] 289 BCE) that human nature was <b>innately</b> good, Dong wrote that people needed external nourishment of education to become 'awakened' and develop morality. To produce morally sound officials, Emperor Wu further sponsored Confucian education when he established the Imperial University in 124 BCE. Despite mainstream acceptance of Confucianism for the rest of Han (and {{until the end of the}} Qing dynasty in 1911), philosophers still defended some Legalist ideas while the state's laws and policies reflect a compromise reached between Legalism and Han Confucianism.|$|E
500|$|Genesis {{stayed at}} Wotton until April 1970, {{by which time}} they had enough new {{material}} for a second album. Recording for Trespass began in June at Trident Studios, London with Anthony as producer and David Hentschel hired as assistant engineer. The album included longer and more complex songs than their first with folk and progressive rock elements with various time signature changes, as in the nine-minute song [...] "The Knife". Trespass {{is the first in}} a series of three Genesis album covers designed by Paul Whitehead. He had completed the cover before the band decided to include [...] "The Knife" [...] on the album. Feeling the cover no longer reflected the album's overall mood, the band persuaded Whitehead to slash a knife across the canvas and have the result photographed. Released in October 1970, Trespass reached No. 1 in Belgium in 1971 and No. 98 in the UK in 1984. [...] "The Knife" [...] was released as a single in May 1971. Rolling Stone briefly mentioned the album with a negative view following its 1974 reissue: [...] "It's spotty, poorly defined, at times <b>innately</b> boring".|$|E
