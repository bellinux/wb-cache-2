At about , [...] the Jerry, still way out of my range, turned under me and slightly to the right. <b>I</b> <b>rolled</b> over on my back, following him and gave him an ineffective burst at long range. By this time I was traveling in excess of [...] My left window blew out, scaring {{the hell out of}} me. I thought I had been hit by some of the ground fire I had observed in the vicinity. I regained control of the aircraft and pulled out above a wheat field. I tried to contact the flight to get myself recognized, but observed an Me 109 making a pass at me from about seven o'clock high. I broke left as well as my plane could and the Jerry overshot. I straightened out and gave him a burst. He chandelled steeply to the left and I shot some more. He passed right over me and I slipped over in an Immelmann. As I straightened out at the top, I saw the pilot bail out.|$|E

I came across two ferocious-looking wolves. I suddenly fell to the floor, and began to feel convulsions, <b>I</b> <b>rolled</b> over three times, and a few seconds later I myself was a wolf. I was out marauding with the other two for five days, until I returned to my own body, the one you see before you today, Your Honour. The other two wolves came with me, who I thought were also wolves, changed into human form. They were from Valencia. One was called Antonio and the other Don Genaro. They too were cursed... we attacked and ate a number of people because we were hungry." [...] Manuel Blanco RomasantaThe prosecutor, Luciano Bastida Hernáez, asked Romasanta to demonstrate the transformation for the court to which he replied that the curse only lasted for thirteen years and that he was now cured as that time had expired the previous week.|$|E
