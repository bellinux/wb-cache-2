5000|$|A {{number of}} {{companies}} and institutes had promoted the solar micro-inverter concept through the 1990s. The basic idea {{is to reduce the}} power handling of a conventional inverter design so that it matches the output of a single panel. This so reduces the size of the inverter that it can be placed {{on the back of the}} panel, producing an [...] "AC panel". Such a system can be connected directly to the grid, or to each other to produce larger arrays. This contrasts with the traditional solar inverter approach where many panels are connected together in series on the <b>DC-side</b> and then run en-masse to a single larger inverter. Several products based on the micro-inverter concept were introduced in the 1990s and especially the early 2000s, but none were widely successful due to a number of factors.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel <b>DC-side</b> discrete-time voltage {{controller}} for grid-connected voltage-sourced converters during asymmetrical faults. The main {{objective is to}} eliminate the second-order voltage oscillation on the VSC’s <b>DC-side,</b> {{as well as the}} positive sequence third-order harmonic current injection into the grid during asymmetrical faults. The compensator is designed based on the comprehensive discrete-time model of the <b>DC-side</b> dynamics. It is shown that <b>DC-side</b> average voltage can be controlled by the positive sequence direct axis current, while the oscillating component can be fully controlled by negative sequence dq-axes currents. The negative sequence current references are obtained using a discrete resonant controller plus a lead filter in order to achieve zero steady state error and asymptotically stability, without injecting harmonics currents into the grid. Simulation results showed the effectiveness of the proposed strategy under severe fault conditions...|$|E
30|$|The VSC is a main {{component}} of a VSC-based HVDC system, which generates harmonics on its both ac and dc sides. These harmonics are called characteristic harmonics of the VSC, which are directly associated {{with the type of}} VSC technologies, modulation techniques and the switching frequency [4]. The harmonic interaction between ac and dc sides of a VSC [5, 6] shows that, when the ac supply of an HVDC system is unbalanced or one side of the converter containing background harmonics, the both ac- and <b>dc-sides</b> of the VSC are produced as non-characteristic harmonics. The non-characteristic harmonics may be non-integral and referred to inter-harmonics [7, 8]. The propagation of background harmonics from one end ac system to the remote one in a point-to-point VSC-based HVDC system has been studied in [9]; however, the harmonic interaction in a multi-terminal VSC-based HVDC system has not been investigated yet.|$|R
40|$|The {{internal}} {{currents and}} voltages of Modular Multilevel Converters (MMCs) contain multiple frequency components in {{steady state operation}} and remain time-periodic even when transformed into a synchronously rotating reference frame. This prevents a straightforward state-space representation where a constant equilibrium point is reached and all state variables converge to constant values under steady-state conditions. Such steady-state time-invariant (SSTI) representations, generally obtained by Park's transformation as commonly applied in vector-oriented control of power converters, are needed for linearization and eigenvalue-based analysis of small-signal stability. This paper presents an energy-based model of an MMC with a modulation strategy where the insertion indices are compensated for the oscillations in the sum arm voltage. The formulation of the model allows for deriving, by the application of Park transformations at three different frequencies, a SSTI representation that accurately captures the internal dynamics of the MMC. This model can be simplified to a reduced order model that maintains accurate reproduction of the external behavior at the ac- and <b>dc-sides</b> while neglecting some of the internal dynamics. The validity and accuracy of these two SSTI MMC models are verified by time-domain simulations and their utilization for eigenvalue-based analysis of MMC dynamics is demonstrated by examples.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of an HVDC converter with the connected power system is of complex nature. An accurate {{model of the}} converter is required to study these interactions. The use of analytical small-signal converter models provides useful insight {{and understanding of the}} {{interaction of}} the HVDC system and the connected system components. In this thesis analytical models of the HVDC converters are developed in the frequency-domain by calculating different transfer functions for small superimposed oscillations of voltage, current, and control signals. The objective is to study the dynamic proprieties of the combined AC-DC interaction and the interaction between different HVDC converters with small signal analysis. It is well known that the classical Bode/Nyquist/Nichols control theory provides a good tool for this purpose if transfer functions that thoroughly describe the 'plant' or the 'process' are available. Thus, {{there is a need for}} such a frequency-domain model. Experience and theoretical calculation have shown that voltage/power stability is a very important issue for an HVDC transmission link based on conventional line-commutated thyristor-controlled converters connected to an AC system with low short circuit capacity. The lower the short circuit capacity of the connected AC system as compared with the power rating of the HVDC converter, the more problems related to voltage/power stability are expected. Low-order harmonic resonance is another issue of concern when line-commutated HVDC converters are connected to a weak AC system. This resonance appears due to the presence of filters and shunt capacitors together with the AC network impedance. With a weak AC system connected to the HVDC converter, the system impedances interact through the converter and create resonances on both the AC- and <b>DC-sides</b> of the converter. In general, these resonance conditions may impose limitations on the design of the HVDC controllers. In order to improve the performance of the HVDC transmission system when it is connected to a weak AC system network, a reactive compensator with a voltage source converter has been closely connected to the inverter bus. In this thesis it is shown that the voltage source converter, with an appropriate control strategy, will behave like a rotating synchronous condenser and can be used in a similar way for the dynamic compensation of power transmission systems, providing voltage support and increasing the transient stability of the converter.

30|$|The studied {{system in}} the Fig.  1 forms {{asynchronous}} interconnections between different frequency ac systems. Therefore, the <b>dc-side</b> characteristic harmonics of VSC 1, which are triple harmonics [11, 12], can act as the <b>dc-side</b> ripples and also are inter-harmonics source to the converters at the other two ends, i.e., VSC 2 and VSC 3. The same mechanisms are also applied to the <b>dc-side</b> characteristics of the VSC 2 or VSC 3 acting as the inter-harmonic sources to the VSC 1. Consequently, the all three converters will operate to cause the different harmonics on both ac- and dc-sides.|$|E
40|$|Instabilities {{related to}} <b>dc-side</b> {{resonances}} {{can occur in}} Voltage Source Converters based HVDC (VSC-HVDC) systems due to undesirable interactions between its dc-transmission link and the VSC dynamics. Previous works have shown that this instability takes place when <b>dc-side</b> resonances coincide with non-passive behavior {{of one of the}} VSCs within the VSC-HVDC system, typically, the VSC that controls the direct-voltage. Through Nyquist stability criterion, it is shown in this paper that also the resonance peak of the <b>dc-side</b> resonance has also a negative impact on the instability, i. e. the higher the resonance peak, the greater the risk of instability. Based on the analysis presented in this paper, it is proposed that, around the <b>dc-side</b> resonance frequency, the magnitude of the VSC subsystem transfer function is limited to the inverse of the resonance peak at highest. Finally, time domain simulations show that the proposed measure stabilizes the system...|$|E

The paper mathematically analyses the <b>DC-side</b> current and the torque ripples of a particular configuration: the stator phase axes of the several modules are axially aligned while the rotors are reciprocally shifted by a suited angle. Moreover each module is connected to a two-level AC-DC converter; such converters are paralleled on the <b>DC-side.</b> For now, just square wave rectifier operation has been considered: the necessary phase shift of the voltages among the converters is found out {{in order to reduce}} the ripple of the resultant <b>DC-side</b> current and of the total torque. Such a phase shift coincides with that among the rotors. Some calculations are checked through a simulation, proving the effectiveness of the proposal...|$|E
30|$|In each {{converter}} station, {{the converter}} {{is the type}} of three-level neutral point clamped (NPC); a three-phase smoothing converter reactor is placed between the converter and a converter transformer. The converter transformer is Yn/Y connection type where the Y winding is connected to the reactor, resulting in decoupling the ac system from the triple harmonics produced by the converter. The ac shunt passive filter group is located between the converter transformer and the converter reactor, comprised of a high-pass filter to filter out the harmonics at frequencies higher than the carrier frequency and a double tuned filter to filter 5 th and the harmonic at twice carrier frequency of the VSC. The <b>dc-side</b> of the VSC uses reservoir dc capacitors to equalize dc voltage, enhance the system dynamics and reduce the <b>dc-side</b> voltage ripple. The <b>dc-side</b> filter circuit consists of the 3 rd order tuned filters and dc-smoothing reactors.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a {{definition}} of a parameter that can be used for the study of the dc-network dynamics in VSC-HVDC systems. Through an appropriate selection of subsystem within a point-to-point VSC-HVDC system, a <b>dc-side</b> power dependent admittance is defined. The particularity of this admittance is that, if negative, there is a risk that a dcside resonance becomes amplified. The <b>dc-side</b> power dependent admittance is measured in a EMT model and compared with a linearized mathematical model, showing good agreement between them. The usefulness of the defined admittance is shown through the assessment of various controller modifications on the dcnetwork stability enhancement. Finally, the conclusions from the analysis are verified through time domain simulations...|$|E
40|$|The input {{admittance}} of a converter, connected to other dynamic subsystems, {{is a useful}} tool to investigate whether poorly damped oscillations or even unstable conditions might occur at certain frequencies. This is of interest in applications employing the modular multilevel converter (MMC), where the internal dynamics of the converter and the increased number of control loops greatly affect the MMC’s dynamic behaviour, compared to other types of converters. In this paper, the <b>dc-side</b> {{input admittance}} of the direct-voltage controlled MMC is derived analytically and verified via small-signal perturbation in a detailed nonlinear time-domain simulation model.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} grid-forming control of power converters in low-inertia power systems. Starting from an average-switch three-phase inverter model, we draw parallels to a synchronous machine (SM) model and propose a novel grid-forming converter control strategy which dwells upon the main characteristic of a SM: {{the presence of an}} internal rotating magnetic field. In particular, we augment the converter system with a virtual oscillator whose frequency is driven by the <b>DC-side</b> voltage measurement and which sets the converter pulse-width-modulation signal, thereby achieving exact matching between the converter in closed-loop and the SM dynamics. We then provide a sufficient condition assuring existence, uniqueness, and global asymptotic stability of equilibria in a coordinate frame attached to the virtual oscillator angle. By actuating the <b>DC-side</b> input of the converter we are able to enforce this sufficient condition. In the same setting, we highlight strict incremental passivity, droop, and power-sharing properties of the proposed framework, which are compatible with conventional requirements of power system operation. We subsequently adopt disturbance decoupling techniques to design additional control loops that regulate the <b>DC-side</b> voltage, as well as AC-side frequency and amplitude, while in the end validating them with numerical experiments...|$|E
40|$|The <b>DC-side</b> {{dynamics}} of Modular Multilevel Converters (MMCs) can {{be prone to}} poorly damped oscillations or stability problems when the second harmonic components of the arm currents are mitigated by a Circulating Current Suppression Controller (CCSC). This paper demonstrates {{that the source of}} these oscillations is the uncontrolled interaction of the <b>DC-side</b> current and the internally stored energy of the MMC. Stable operation and improved performance of the MMC control system can be ensured by introducing closed loop control of the energy and the <b>DC-side</b> current. The presented analysis relies on a detailed state-space model of the MMC which can be linearized to achieve a Linear Time Invariant (LTI) model, allowing for eigenvalue analysis of the small-signal {{dynamics of}} the MMC. Participation factor analysis indicates the suitability of introducing control of the internal capacitor voltage or the corresponding stored energy. An MMC connected to a DC power source with an equivalent capacitance, and operated with DC voltage droop in the active power flow control, is used as an example for the presented analysis. The developed small-signal models and the improvement in small-signal dynamics are verified by time-domain simulations in comparison to an EMT simulation model of a detailed MMC...|$|E

A sample of the rectified line voltage is multiplied by {{the product of a}} voltage feedback control signal times the ripple feedback signal ratio to form the input to the pulse-width modulator which produces the gating waveform for the converter of the rectifier system such that the oscillation and sensitivity of the converter system is reduced, and the AC line current waveform has low distortion, regardless of the <b>DC-side</b> ripple current levels...|$|E
40|$|Three-phase voltage-source {{converters}} (VSC) {{are commonly}} used as a power flow interface in AC/DC hybrid power systems. The system may suffer from unpredictable transient disturbance from <b>DC-side</b> or grid-side faults.

In this paper, the transient response of a three-phase VSC under practical grid fault condition is studied. The converter will also exhibit a catastrophic bifurcation after the transient disturbance. The expanded AC current will cause excessive devise stress. A large-signal analysis is adopted to reveal the physical origin of the phenomenon and to locate the boundary of the instability.

The models capture this coupling and can thus be used for small signal sta-bility and robustness analysis. A short introduction t o transfer functions for LTP systems is given. To illustrate the method, an LTP model for the Ad-tranz locomotive Re 4 / 4 is derived.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{analytical}} model {{to evaluate the}} noncharacteristic harmonics that are generated by three-phase three-wire voltage-source converters (VSCs) operating under unbalanced sinusoidal voltage conditions. This model permits the calculation of the oscillating current on the VSC dc side by considering the unbalanced voltages on its ac side. It {{can be used to}} prove that the use of dc voltage control techniques to eliminate VSC <b>dc-side</b> double frequency voltage ripple necessarily creates three-phase currents with undesirable low-frequency harmonic components on the VSC ac side. In this paper, the attention is directed to the instantaneous oscillating real power component at twice the line frequency, rather than to other power components. The noncharacteristic current components analyzed in this paper, such as the fundamental negative sequence and third-order harmonic components of positive and negative sequences are calculated using the proposed model in time-domain simulations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the modeling {{and design of}} a closed-loop controller for a Z-source inverter. The Z-source inverter is a recently proposed single-stage power converter, and {{it is capable of}} operating in both buck and boost modes. Hence, this inverter gives an economical solution for power conversion in distributed generation (DG) applications, particularly by eliminating the need for a two-stage conversion. Moreover, applications such as DG demand quality output waveforms, and additionally, when the system is subjected to input- and load-side disturbances, their effects need to be minimized. This can be achieved with closed-loop controlling. Toward this end, the system is modeled first with large- and small-signal modeling techniques, and relevant transfer functions are derived. The <b>dc-side</b> of the Z-source inverter shows a non-minimum-phase characteristic, and the output voltage of a Z-source impedance network shows a significant overshoot and undershoot, following a step change in the input due to energy resettling. These effects could be transferred to the ac-side, giving rise to the undershoot and overshoot in the ac output as well. Hence, the proposed controllers should be able to minimize such effects. The ac- and dc-sides are considered separately when designing the controllers. An indirect controller is employed in the <b>dc-side,</b> whereas the ac-side controller is designed in the synchronous reference frame. The modulation index, shoot-through time, and saturation levels are appropriately selected so that the <b>dc-side</b> effects are prevented from propagating into the ac-side. The simulation results are obtained using a state-space-averaged inverter model, and an experimental prototype is built in a laboratory to prove the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. Simulation and experimental results show good reference-tracking and disturbance-rejection properties, validating the desired functionality of the proposed controller...|$|E
40|$|The {{fault-tolerant}} multilevel converters {{are gaining}} increased interests for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) applications {{due to their}} ability to suppress the fault current during <b>dc-side</b> faults. However, most of these topologies use full-bridge submodules (FBSMs) resulting in the requirement {{of a large number of}} semiconductor switches. In this paper, a new generalized cross-connected SM (GX-SM) structure is presented, which requires lesser number of switching devices and provides the same functionality as the FBSM. A comparison of the switches required in the different converter topologies using FBSMs and GX-SMs is performed. The performance evaluation of two of the <b>dc-side</b> fault-tolerant converter topologies, namely alternate arm modular multilevel converter (AAMMC) and hybrid cascaded modular multilevel converter (HCMC) with the GX-SM, is performed using simulation studies done in PSCAD/EMTDC.

Again, this dominant component is conveyed to the ac systems 2 and 3 to produce a series of inter-harmonics, where the negative-sequence and positive-sequence components have frequencies at 2 ω 1  – ω 2 and 2 ω 1  + ω 2, respectively, are dominant.|$|E
40|$|The Alternate Arm Converter (AAC) {{was one of}} {{the first}} modular {{converter}} topologies to feature <b>DC-side</b> fault ride-through capability with only a small penalty in power efficiency. However, the simple alternation of its arm conduction periods (with an additional short overlap period) resulted in (i) substantial 6 -pulse ripples in the DC current waveform, (ii) large <b>DC-side</b> filter requirements, and (iii) limited operating area close to an energy sweet-spot. This paper presents a new mode of operation called Extended Overlap (EO) based on the extension of the overlap period to 60 ◦ which facilitates a fundamental redefinition of the working principles of the AAC. The EO-AAC has its DC current path decoupled from the AC current paths, a fact allowing (i) smooth DC current waveforms, (ii) elimination of DC filters, and (iii) restriction lifting on the feasible operating point. Analysis of this new mode and EO- AAC design criteria are presented and subsequently verified with tests on an experimental prototype. Finally, a comparison with other modular converters demonstrates that the EO-AAC is at least as power efficient as a hybrid MMC (i. e. a DC fault ride-through capable MMC) while offering a smaller converter footprint because of a reduced requirement for energy storage in the submodules and a reduced inductor volume...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{penetration of}} renewable generators {{can be a}} significant challenge due to the fluctuation of their power generation. Energy storage (ES) units are one solution to improve power supply quality and guarantee system stability. In this paper, a hybrid microgrid {{is built based on}} photovoltaic (PV) generator and ES; and coordinated control is proposed and developed to achieve power management in a decentralized manner. This control scheme contains three different droop strategies according to characteristics of PV and ES. First, the modified droop control is proposed for PV, which can take full utilization of renewable energy and avoid regulating output active power frequently. Second, to maintain the direct current (DC) bus voltage stability, a novel droop control incorporating a constant power band is presented for <b>DC-side</b> ES. Third, a cascade droop control is designed for alternating current (AC) -side ES. Thus, the ES lifetime is prolonged. Moreover, interlinking converters (ICs) provide a bridge between AC/DC buses in a hybrid microgrid. The power control of IC is enabled when the AC- or <b>DC-side</b> suffer from active power demand shortage. In particular, if the AC microgrid does not satisfy the reactive power demand, IC then acts as a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM).
