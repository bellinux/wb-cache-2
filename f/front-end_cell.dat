40|$|A new analog pixel <b>front-end</b> <b>cell</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} for the ATLAS detector at the future Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN). This analog cell has been submitted in two commercial 0. 25 mu m CMOS processes (in an analog test chip format), using special layout techniques for radiation hardness purposes. It is composed of two cascaded amplifiers followed by a fast discriminator featuring a detection threshold {{within the range of}} 1000 to 10000 electrons. The first preamplifier has the principal role of providing a large bandwidth, low input impedance, and fast rise time in order to enhance the time-walk and crosstalk performance, whereas the second fully differential amplifier is aimed at delivering a sufficiently high-voltage gain for optimum comparison. A new do feedback concept renders the cell tolerant of sensor leakage current up to 300 nA and provides monitoring of this current. Two 5 -bit digital-to-analog converters tolerant to single- event upset have been implemented for threshold and recovery-time pixel-to-pixel matching purposes. Special {{attention has been paid to}} the power-supply rejection ratio to minimize sensitivity to pickup. The complete cell dissipates 30 mu W, occupies an area of 50 * 90 mu m /sup 2 / and is operated with a single 1. 6 -V power supply. Measurements of two test chips are presented. (10 refs) ...|$|E

The detector is of the "butterfly" type, the sensitive area being subdivided into two regions with a maximum drift length of 3. 3 cm. The device was also tested in a pion beam (at the CERN PS) tagged by means of a microstrip detector telescope. Bipolar VLSI <b>front-end</b> <b>cells</b> featuring a noise of 250 e/sup -/ RMS at 0 pF with a slope of 40 e/sup -//pF have been used to read out the signals.

40|$|In the Neutrino Factory {{front-end}} the muon beam {{coming from}} the interaction of a high-power (4 MW) proton beam on a mercury jet target is transformed through a buncher, a phase rotator and an ionization cooling channel before entering the downstream acceleration system. The muon front-end channel is densely packed with solenoid magnets, normal conducting radio-frequency cavities and absorber windows for the cooling section. The tolerance to the misalignment of the different components has to be determined in order on one hand to set the limits beyond which {{the performance of the}} front-end channel would be degraded; on the other hand to optimize the design and assembly of the <b>front-end</b> <b>cells</b> such that the component alignment can be checked and corrected for where crucial for the performance of the channel. In this paper we show the results of some of the simulations of the frontend channel performance where the magnetic field direction has been altered compared to the baseline...|$|R
40|$|Cloud {{radio access}} network (C-RAN) is a recent trend of RAN {{architecture}} positioned to help the operators to address challenges of new wireless services, such as emerging 4 G and 5 G mobile networks. C-RAN uses baseband processing units in a central server which connects to the radio <b>front-ends</b> at <b>cell</b> sites via the so-called fronthaul network. The fronthaul infrastructure is currently provided by CPRI (Common Public Radio Interface) and OBSAI (Open Basestation Architecture Initiative) industry standards which use dedicated optical links with high deployment costs. An alternative is to use Ethernet technology aiming to reuse of network infrastructure available in many commercial buildings. However, {{in contrast to the}} traditional synchronous fronthaul, Ethernet suffers with packet delay variation (PDV) and challenging synchronization recovery. This work presents a complete and flexible testbed to evaluate Ethernet-based fronthaul. The system is validated via extensive measurements that show the effects of synchronization procedures and network impairments on regenerated clock phase noise...|$|R
40|$|High {{energy and}} nuclear physics {{experiments}} need tracking devices with increasing spatial precision and readout speed {{in the face}} of ever-higher track densities and increased radiation environments. The new generation of hybrid pixel detectors (arrays of silicon diodes bump bonded to arrays of <b>front-end</b> electronic <b>cells)</b> is {{the state of the art}} technology able to meet these challenges. We report on irradiation studies performed on BTeV pixel readout chip prototypes exposed to a 200 MeV proton beam at Indiana University Cyclotron Facility. Prototype pixel readout chip preFPIX 2 has been developed at Fermilab for collider experiments and implemented in standard 0. 25 micron CMOS technology following radiation tolerant design rules. The tests confirmed the radiation tolerance of the chip design to proton total dose up to 87 MRad. In addition, non destructive radiation-induced single event upsets have been observed in on-chip static registers and the single bit upset cross section has been extensively measured...|$|R
40|$|A {{service value}} {{networks}} (SVNs) {{structural equation modeling}} (SEM) approach is suggested as new method to investigate services industries. This study uses the pharmacy industry to demonstrate the author's theoretically developed SVNs approach, and focuses the research upon the point of contact between the business and the customer - termed the business-customer encounter. It models the observed variables associated with the research determined <b>front-end</b> business <b>cells,</b> customer engaging cells and the immediate (micro) environments of the business and its customers. The linkage between the business and the customer {{is found to be}} via multiple significant engagement pathways, which combine to deliver the net business-customer encounter outcome. This SVN SEM approach sheds new light on the complexities in delivering a business-customer exchange, and gives the manager an approach that may be used to better align the business and its deliverables with the satisfaction, servicing and perceived value of the customer. This SVN SEM approach is more complex than the approaches of customer relationship management (CRM), and it allows the business to reposition itself and engage higher levels of agility specifically targeted to its customer requests...|$|R
40|$|Harris Semiconductor is {{committed}} to the development of expert system technology which combines the concepts of real time data acquisition, recency-weighted process characteriza-tion, and automated system tuning. The Semiconductor Products Division, located in Melbourne, Florida, has targeted the photolithographic area for the implementation of such an expert system. In line with a philosophy of continuous im-provement, this system will monitor, characterize, and control <b>front-end</b> photoresist <b>cells</b> towards optimal product through-put, quality, and yield. A primary concern of any system allowed to control itself is the validity of the data it uses to build the process characteri-zation. Although recency-weighted characterization is desir-able to quickly respond to process variations and mean shifts, the system must not be permitted to respond to products contaminated with assignable causes of uncontrolled vari-ation. Including this data would result in uncontrolled prod-ucts, and the process drift possibly going undetected. Actual response is to hold the suspect run, recommend a corrective action, and advise engineering of where to look to isolate the cause of variation. A key feature of this expert system is its ability to detect out-of-control products while continuously improving the process aim and tightening the process variation. Techniques of statistical process control combined with customer require-ments and the expertise of our photolithographic engineers make up the expert system's rule-base. This paper discusses technical aspects of the expert system along with the problems involved in allowing a process to control itself. It explains the physical computer implementation along with detailed de-scriptions of major decision points. A discussion of statistical process control as implemented in this expert system is also included. 2...|$|R
40|$|Service Value Networks (SVNs) {{across the}} business's {{interaction}} environment. SVNs are constructed via interconnecting and networked value chains linking suppliers, peripheral partners and external support or legislated external sources into the networked internal business cells including executive strategy, target marketing, innovation, operations, IT/web communications and economic value (Hamilton, 2005, 2006). The <b>front-end</b> business <b>cells</b> and their networked customer interactors ultimately target delivering a customer exchange. Hence the SVN {{extends beyond the}} business environment and {{into the realm of}} the customer. The customer exchange is driven by customer perceptions, and these in tum are driven by the local and global external environmental - including political/legislative, economic, socio-cultural, technological, legal and environmental drivers (Johnston et al, 2005). The business and its integrated networks is also affected by the same local and global externals, as is the final business-customer encounter and exchange. Understanding such SVN components presents a mechanism that increases the likelihood of generating a successful business-customer encounter and exchange. This exchange may be a physical and/or services exchange, and/or an information and/or ideas exchange. To the business, this encounter is a trade that results in the business acquiring an economic exchange that delivers some movement towards a net positive economic outcome. SVNs - an approach postulated, theorized and developed by the author, uses a Structured Equation Modeling (SEM) method to highlight business-customer interaction pathways, and to elucidate additional business tools whereby the business may further enhanced its business-customer encounter alignment towards delivering win - win, business-customer solutions. This procedure unlocks the complexities of the networked nature of a real service industry and shows the reality of SVNs. In addition once measured and modelled, the business-customer encounter interface may unlock new competitive and uniqueness parameters for the service industry investigated thereby delivering new sustainability options for the industry and its constituent members...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a low-power, single-stage, and variable-gain controlled double-balanced type RF receiver <b>front-end,</b> called DB-LMV <b>cell,</b> by merging low-noise amplifier (LNA), mixer, and voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) exploiting a series LC (SLC) network. The low intermediate frequency (IF) or baseband signal {{can be directly}} sensed at the drain nodes of the VCO switching transistors and filtered out at the IF output port by adding a simple resistor-capacitor (RC) filter. Variable gain control function is achieved by adding a negative resistance cell at the IF output. Using a 65 nm CMOS technology, the proposed DB-LMV cell is designed. Oscillating at around 3. 2 GHz, the phase noise of the proposed DB-LMV cell is − 67. 7 dBc/Hz, − 91. 1 dBc/Hz, and − 111. 8 dB/Hz at 10 kHz, 100 kHz, and 1 MHz offset frequency, respectively. The simulated voltage conversion gain varies linearly from 23 dB to 51 dB. The noise figure is about 6. 3 dB at 1 MHz offset frequency. The LMV cell consumes 0. 56 mW dc power from a 1 V supply.

40|$|Porter's 2001 'strategy and the Internet' {{paper is}} a key article {{in the field of}} on-line strategy. This paper assesses Porter's views in the light of current and past developments. Porter's paper, whilst still thought {{provoking}} in many ways, now shows some weaknesses, and in places is no longer as strong as it was in 2001. It presents an approach that attempts to capture past theories and again show their relevance to the on-line world. This paper suggests that the Internet does offer disruptive transitions, does allow new competitiveness models, does allow for new strategic planning approaches, and can deliver personalized one-on-one business to individual customer solutions (termed customerized solutions), and that a service value networks approach offers a mechanism to enable such solutions. Service value networks focus on the services industry -which engages over 82 % of US employment [14], and over 75 % of Australian jobs [1], and pursue a matrixed networks approach that offers a more complete, and more detailed approach to the delivery of both the business <b>front-end</b> customer engagement <b>cells</b> and to the customer perceived services [7];[11]. Today, the modern business employs a host of strategic, marketing, servicing, innovation(s), product(s), and economic approaches to delivering services.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{elucidate}} the pathways that can enhance pharmacy-to-customer engagements, and give capacity to build closely aligned customer interface systems. Design/methodology/approach – A nationwide, pharmacy and customer, dual survey-based service value networks (SVNs) approach, analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM), shows significant business-customer encounter information pathways act between the pharmacy and its engaging customer. Findings – The complex nature of the business-customer exchange and its interacting pathways is highlighted. Six <b>front-end</b> SVNs business <b>cells</b> engaged in this paper have significant direct (and/or indirect) impact on customer perspectives of their pharmacy. Hence, the pharmacy front-end business model should be fully and intelligently networked. Research limitations/implications – The SVNs and SEM approach yields a strong robust pharmacy model, and can move pharmacy business management mechanisms to elevated customer-engaging levels. It can offer customer-targeted interaction solutions with enhanced perceived satisfaction. This SVNs approach is efficient, understandable, measurable and business specific. It is appropriate for market leaders, innovators or differentiators. Combined with other interface-related toolkits it can deliver competitive advantage parameters such as understanding the key measures that improve business-customer alignment. Originality/value – SVNs developed under SEM offer a new way to better align the business with its customers. They can be applied at the individual community pharmacy or pharmacy chain level. SVNs release the key measures from which pertinent interacting front-end business-to-customer pathways may be adjusted in a quest to strategically build and align the business closely to its customer demands. This win-win SVNs interface procedure can also be applied within other service industries...|$|R
