Further, Breyer held that nothing in the law prevents a judge from including age in the custody analysis. Breyer called the discussion of <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> law enforcement misleading; while <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> law enforcement can be difficult to determine, Breyer noted that Alvarado's age was a known objective fact.|$|E

5|$|According to Lennon, the {{inspiration}} for the first two verses was the death of Tara Browne, the 21-year-old heir to the Guinness fortune who had crashed his Lotus Elan on 18 December 1966 in Redcliffe Gardens, Earl's Court. Browne had been a friend of Lennon and McCartney, and had, earlier in 1966, instigated McCartney's first <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> LSD. Lennon adapted the song's verse lyrics from a story in the 17 January 1967 edition of the Daily Mail, which reported the ruling on a custody action over Browne's two young children.|$|E

The description given by Pennant was precise enough to be included by Johann Erxleben in his Systema regni animalis by simply translating Pennant's text into Latin.

Inexperience with law enforcement was rejected as well; the Court noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.|$|E
