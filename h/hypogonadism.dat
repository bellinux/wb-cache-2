5|$|Most {{pituitary}} hormones can {{be replaced}} indirectly by administering {{the products of the}} effector glands: hydrocortisone (cortisol) for adrenal insufficiency, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, testosterone for male <b>hypogonadism,</b> and estradiol for female <b>hypogonadism</b> (usually with a progestogen to inhibit unwanted effects on the uterus). Growth hormone is available in synthetic form, but needs to be administered parenterally (by injection). Antidiuretic hormone {{can be replaced}} by desmopressin (DDAVP) tablets or nose spray. Generally, the lowest dose of the replacement medication is used to restore wellbeing and correct the deranged results, as excessive doses would cause side-effects or complications. Those requiring hydrocortisone are usually instructed to increase their dose in physically stressful events such as injury, hospitalization and dental work as these are times when the normal supplementary dose may be inadequate, putting the patient at risk of adrenal crisis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypogonadism,</b> a {{decrease}} in male sex hormones may manifest as impotence, infertility, loss of sexual drive, and testicular atrophy, and can result from primary gonadal injury or suppression of hypothalamic/pituitary function. <b>Hypogonadism</b> is associated with cirrhosis due to alcoholism or hemochromatosis.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive/endocrine: libido changes, {{reversible}} infertility, hypogonadotropic <b>hypogonadism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Age: Testosterone levels {{gradually}} reduce as men age. This {{effect is}} {{sometimes referred to}} as andropause or late-onset <b>hypogonadism.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} opioids, chronic use of {{oxycodone}} (particularly with higher doses) often causes concurrent <b>hypogonadism</b> or hormone imbalance.|$|E
25|$|Paternal {{inheritance}} of a deletion {{of this region}} is associated with Prader-Willi syndrome (characterised by hypotonia, obesity, and <b>hypogonadism).</b>|$|E
25|$|Additional {{symptoms}} are variable, and may include exercise intolerance, cataracts, hearing loss, sensory axonal neuropathy, ataxia, clinical depression, <b>hypogonadism,</b> and parkinsonism.|$|E
25|$|Several drugs induce <b>hypogonadism,</b> {{for example}} {{aromatase}} inhibitors used in breast cancer, methotrexate and other antimetabolite drugs, depot progesterone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists.|$|E
25|$|Rothmund–Thomson {{syndrome}} (i.e. {{autosomal recessive}} association of congenital bone defects, {{hair and skin}} dysplasias, <b>hypogonadism,</b> and cataracts) is associated with increased risk of this disease.|$|E
25|$|Turner {{syndrome}} {{is a cause}} of primary amenorrhea, premature ovarian failure (hypergonadotropic <b>hypogonadism),</b> streak gonads and infertility. Failure to develop secondary sex characteristics (sexual infantilism) is typical.|$|E
25|$|Clinical studies {{consistently}} {{conclude that}} morphine, like other opioids, often causes <b>hypogonadism</b> and hormone imbalances in chronic users of both sexes. This side effect is dose-dependent and occurs in both therapeutic and recreational users. Morphine {{can interfere with}} menstruation in women by suppressing levels of luteinizing hormone. Many studies suggest the majority (perhaps as much as 90%) of chronic opioid users have opioid-induced <b>hypogonadism.</b> This effect may cause the increased likelihood of osteoporosis and bone fracture observed in chronic morphine users. Studies suggest the effect is temporary. , the effect of low-dose or acute use of morphine on the endocrine system is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Prolactin {{levels may}} be checked {{as part of}} a sex hormone workup, as {{elevated}} prolactin secretion can suppress the secretion of FSH and GnRH, leading to <b>hypogonadism</b> and sometimes causing erectile dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|At high dosages (5 to 60mg/day), for {{instance}} {{those used in}} the treatment of gynecological disorders, NET can cause <b>hypogonadism</b> due to its antigonadotropic effects and can have estrogenic and weak androgenic side effects.|$|E
25|$|The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) has {{documented}} that prenatal DES exposure in males is positively {{linked to a}} condition known as <b>hypogonadism</b> (low testosterone levels) that may require treatment with testosterone replacement therapy.|$|E
25|$|Aa low {{testosterone}} level (<b>hypogonadism)</b> in men may {{be treated}} with testosterone administration. Prostate cancer may be treated by removing {{the major source of}} testosterone: testicle removal (orchiectomy); or agents which block androgens from accessing their receptor: anti-androgens.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone is {{also used}} as a {{medication}} to treat male <b>hypogonadism</b> and certain types of breast cancer. Since testosterone levels gradually decrease as men age, synthetic testosterone is sometimes prescribed to older men to counteract this deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Loss-of-function CUL4B {{mutation}} {{events have}} been discovered in numerous patients with , which is characterized by aggressive outbursts, seizures, relative macrocephaly, central obesity, <b>hypogonadism,</b> pes cavus and tremor. CUL4B mutations have also been associated with malformations of cortical development.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen is {{also used}} in the therapy of vaginal atrophy, hypoestrogenism (as a result of <b>hypogonadism,</b> oophorectomy, or primary ovarian failure), amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and oligomenorrhea. Estrogens {{can also be used}} to {{suppress}} lactation after child birth.|$|E
25|$|Methyltestosterone is or {{has been}} used in the {{treatment}} of delayed puberty, <b>hypogonadism,</b> cryptorchidism, and erectile dysfunction in males, and in low doses to treat menopausal symptoms (specifically for osteoporosis, hot flashes, and to increase libido and energy), postpartum breast pain and engorgement, and breast cancer in women.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone is a {{medication}} and naturally occurring steroid hormone. It is a progestogen and neurosteroid {{and is used}} mainly in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopause, <b>hypogonadism,</b> and transgender women. Progesterone can be taken by mouth, in through the vagina, and by injection into muscle or fat, among other routes. A progesterone vaginal ring form used for birth control also exists {{in some areas of}} the world.|$|E
25|$|In the {{minority}} of cases with bilaterally non-palpable testes, further testing {{to locate the}} testes, assess their function, and exclude additional problems is often useful. Pelvic ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging performed and interpreted by a radiologist can often, but not invariably, locate the testes while confirming absence of a uterus. A karyotype can confirm or exclude forms of dysgenetic primary <b>hypogonadism,</b> such as Klinefelter syndrome or mixed gonadal dysgenesis.|$|E
25|$|Hypogonadal {{states can}} cause {{secondary}} osteoporosis. These include Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, Kallmann syndrome, anorexia nervosa, andropause, hypothalamic amenorrhea or hyperprolactinemia. In females, {{the effect of}} <b>hypogonadism</b> is mediated by estrogen deficiency. It can appear as early menopause (<45 years) or from prolonged premenopausal amenorrhea (>1 year). Bilateral oophorectomy (surgical removal of the ovaries) and premature ovarian failure cause deficient estrogen production. In males, testosterone deficiency is the cause (for example, andropause or after surgical removal of the testes).|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} {{methyltestosterone}} include androgenic side effects like oily skin, acne, seborrhea, increased facial/body hair growth, scalp hair loss, increased aggressiveness and sex drive, and spontaneous erections, {{as well as}} estrogenic side effects like gynecomastia, fluid retention, and edema. In women, methyltestosterone can cause partially irreversible virilization, for instance voice deepening, hirsutism, clitoromegaly, breast atrophy, and muscle hypertrophy, as well as menstrual disturbances and reversible infertility. In men, the drug may also cause <b>hypogonadism,</b> testicular atrophy, and reversible infertility at sufficiently high dosages.|$|E
25|$|A form of TTD without {{photosensitivity}} also exists, {{although its}} mechanism is unclear. The MPLKIP gene {{has been associated}} with this form of TTD, although it accounts for only 20% of all known cases of the non-photosensitive form of TTD, and the function of its gene product is also unclear. Mutations in the TTDN1 gene explain another 10% of non-photosensitive TTD. The function of the gene product of TTDN1 is unknown, but the sex organs of individuals with this form of TTD often produce no hormones, a condition known as <b>hypogonadism.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{administration}} of hydroxyzine in large amounts by ingestion or intramuscular administration during {{the onset of}} pregnancy can cause fetal abnormalities—when administered to pregnant rats, mice and rabbits, hydroxyzine caused abnormalities such as <b>hypogonadism</b> with doses significantly above that of the human therapeutic range. In humans, a significant dose {{has not yet been}} established in studies, and by default, the FDA has introduced contraindication guidelines in regard to hydroxyzine. Similarly the use in those at risk from or showing previous signs of hypersensitivity is also contraindicated. Hydroxyzine is contraindicated for intravenous (IV) injection, as it has shown to cause hemolysis.|$|E
25|$|The androgenic:anabolic {{ratio of}} an AAS is an {{important}} factor when determining the clinical application of these compounds. Compounds with a high ratio of androgenic to an anabolic effects are the drug of choice in androgen-replacement therapy (e.g., treating <b>hypogonadism</b> in males), whereas compounds with a reduced androgenic:anabolic ratio are preferred for anemia and osteoporosis, and to reverse protein loss following trauma, surgery, or prolonged immobilization. Determination of androgenic:anabolic ratio is typically performed in animal studies, which has led to the marketing of some compounds claimed to have anabolic activity with weak androgenic effects. This disassociation is less marked in humans, where all AAS have significant androgenic effects.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{antiandrogen}} properties, spironolactone {{can cause}} effects associated with low androgen levels and <b>hypogonadism</b> in males. For this reason, men are typically not prescribed spironolactone for any {{longer than a}} short period of time, e.g., for an acute exacerbation of heart failure. A newer drug, eplerenone, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of heart failure, and lacks the antiandrogen effects of spironolactone. As such, it is far more suitable for men for whom long-term medication is being chosen. However, eplerenone may not be as effective as spironolactone or the related drug canrenone in reducing mortality from heart failure.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{studies have}} {{consistently}} associated medical and recreational opioid use with <b>hypogonadism</b> and hormone imbalance in different sexes. The effect is dose-dependent. Most {{studies suggest that}} the majority (perhaps as much as 90%) of chronic opioid users suffer hormone imbalances. Opioids can also interfere with menstruation in women by limiting the production of luteinizing hormone (LH). Opioid-induced endocrinopathy likely causes the strong association of opioid use with osteoporosis and bone fracture. It also may increase pain and thereby interfere with the intended clinical effect of opioid treatment. Opioid-induced endocrinopathy is likely caused by their agonism of opioid receptors in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. One study found that the depressed testosterone levels of heroin addicts returned to normal within one month of abstinence, suggesting that the effect is not permanent. , the effect of low-dose or acute opiate use on the endocrine system is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Growth {{retardation}} may occur, as {{height gain}} may slow and can stop completely with severe weight loss or chronic malnutrition. In such cases, provided that growth potential is preserved, height increase can resume and reach full potential after normal intake is resumed. Height potential is normally preserved if the duration {{and severity of}} illness are not significant or if the illness is accompanied by delayed bone age (especially prior to a bone age of approximately 15 years), as <b>hypogonadism</b> may partially counteract the effects of undernutrition on height by allowing for a longer duration of growth compared to controls. Appropriate early treatment can preserve height potential, and may even help to increase it in some post-anorexic subjects, due to factors such as long-term reduced estrogen-producing adipose tissue levels compared to premorbid levels. In some cases, especially where onset is before puberty, complications such as stunted growth and pubertal delay are usually reversible.|$|E
2500|$|Erectile {{dysfunction}} and <b>hypogonadism,</b> {{resulting in}} decreased libido ...|$|E
2500|$|In females, <b>hypogonadism</b> {{can cause}} sexual {{infantilism}} or abnormal pubertal development, infertility, and other reproductive system abnormalities ...|$|E
2500|$|RP {{associated}} with <b>hypogonadism,</b> and developmental delay with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern is seen with Bardet-Biedl syndrome ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{possible}} {{cause of a}} delay in the onset of puberty past the age 14 in girls and 15 in boys is Kallmann syndrome, a form of hypogonadotropic <b>hypogonadism</b> (HH). Kallmann syndrome is also associated {{with a lack of}} sense of smell (anosmia). [...] Kallmann syndrome and other forms of HH affect both men and women. It is caused by a failure in HPG axis at puberty which results in low or zero gonadotropin (LH and FSH) levels with the subsequent result of a failure to commence or complete puberty, secondary <b>hypogonadism</b> and infertility.|$|E
2500|$|Klinefelter {{syndrome}} {{is the most}} common sex chromosome aneuploidy in humans. It represents the most frequent cause of <b>hypogonadism</b> and infertility in men. Most cases are caused by nondisjunction errors in paternal meiosis I.|$|E
2500|$|Lh {{response}} to GnRH: Luteinizing hormone (Lh) {{response to}} gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH): Tests the pituitary glands' response to GnRh a hormone {{produced in the}} hypothalamus. [...] <b>Hypogonadism</b> is often seen in anorexia nervosa cases.|$|E
2500|$|Cellulite {{is thought}} to occur in 80–90% of post-adolescent females. There {{appears to be a}} {{hormonal}} component to its presentation. Its existence as a real disorder has been challenged and the prevailing medical opinion is that it is merely the [...] "normal condition of many women". It is rarely seen in males, but is more common in males with androgen-deficient states, such as Klinefelter's syndrome, <b>hypogonadism,</b> postcastration states and in those patients receiving estrogen therapy for prostate cancer. The cellulite becomes more severe as the androgen deficiency worsens in these males.|$|E
