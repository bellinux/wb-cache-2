By February 2012, Canadian singer Michael Bublé was confirmed as one of many other artists who expressed interest in recording a duet with Selena. In late August 2012, fans were asked {{to fill out a}} survey from the official Selena Facebook page, <b>inviting</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> choose three Latin singers and three non-Latin singers {{they would like to see}} recording a duet with Selena on the follow-up album.

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Caliph Umar, whose forces at Qadisiyah were {{threatened}} with confronting the Sassanid armies, ordered Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas {{to enter into}} negotiations with the Persians and send emissaries to Yazdegerd III and his commander Rostam Farrokhzād, apparently <b>inviting</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Islam. This was most probably the delaying tactic employed by Umar on the Persian front. Meanwhile, he sent reinforcements of 6,000 troops, mostly from Yemen, to Khalid. This force included 1,000 Sahaba (companions of Muhammad), among whom were 100 veterans of the Battle of Badr, the first battle in Islamic history, and included citizens of the highest rank, such as Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, Abu Sufyan, and his wife Hind bint Utbah.|$|E

He was so taken with {{it that he}} raved about the band in Rolling Stone, <b>inviting</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> open for his group, Blink-182 on their 2004 European tour. On the trek, he became good friends with the musicians. He told them that he had purchased an abundance of recording gear and amplifiers for the previous Blink-182 album and told the band of his interest in recording music from a production standpoint. At the final show of the tour, guitarist Joshua Cain went to Hoppus' dressing room {{and asked him to}} produce their next record. Although Hoppus had never produced anything before, he was excited {{to be a part of}} the album and accepted the offer.|$|E
50|$|Emperor Frederick II, the suzerain of Lorraine, {{considered}} it a felony for Duke Theobald I of Lorraine to support a candidate he opposed, so he occupied the city of Rosheim, which he had given to Theobald I's father. Theobald I responded in 1218, retaking Rosheim and then ravaging Alsace, particularly Frederick II's vineyards. Nonetheless Theobald I lost Rosheim again when a pro-Frederick II uprising in the city killed the Lorraine garrison (massacring them in their cellars after <b>inviting</b> <b>them</b> down <b>to</b> sample their wines).|$|R

5|$|Royal Arsenal's move to professionalism in 1891 was {{frowned upon}} {{by many of}} the amateur {{southern}} clubs, and they were banned from participating in local competitions by the London Football Association. With friendlies and the FA Cup the only matches available for Royal Arsenal, they attempted to set up a southern equivalent of The Football League, but the move failed. The club changed its name to Woolwich Arsenal in 1893 when it formed a limited liability company to raise capital to purchase the Manor Ground. Woolwich Arsenal's future looked bleak until the Football League came to their rescue by <b>inviting</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> join in 1893. Arsenal were the first Southern club to enter the League, initially joining the Second Division; in response, some of the club's amateur players who rejected professionalism and wanted a workers' team to represent just the Royal Arsenal, broke away to form a short-lived alternative side, Royal Ordnance Factories.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{the group}} {{performed}} at a music festival {{held by the}} Dakar French Cultural Center, where the French rapper MC Solaar heard their performance and invited the group to open {{for him when he}} debuted in Dakar in October of that year. The rapper was impressed with Positive Black Soul, <b>inviting</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> continue performing with him in France. Two years later the group put out its first release, a cassette entitled Boul Falé. The album was followed by more touring in France, as well as in England and Switzerland. In the same year, the Senegalese musician Baaba Maal offered PBS the opportunity to be on his album Firin' in Fouta. Maal was signed to Mango Records and because of this recording with him, Positive Black Soul were signed as well. They released their album debut Salaam on Mango Records. After achieving success in Senegal and some abroad, the group continued touring, including 130 performances in 1997. They also began organizing concerts in Dakar and promoting new groups including Daara J and Pee Froiss.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic party {{continued}} {{to criticize the}} Sangkum and Sihanouk in their newspaper, much to Sihanouk's consternation. In August 1957 Sihanouk finally lost patience, calling out Democrat leaders for a debate. Five of them attended. At the debate, held at the royal palace, Sihanouk spoke in a belligerent tone, challenging the Democrat leaders to present evidence of malfeasance in his government and <b>inviting</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> join the Sangkum. The Democrat leaders gave hesitant responses, and according to American historian David P. Chandler, it gave the audience {{the impression that they}} were disloyal to the monarchy. The debate led to the effective demise of the Democratic party, as its leaders were subsequently beaten up by government soldiers, with Sihanouk's tacit approval. With the Democrats vanquished, Sihanouk focused on preparing for general elections, slated to be held in March 1958. He drafted left-wing politicians, including Hou Yuon, Hu Nim, and Chau Seng, to stand as Sangkum candidates, with a view to winning left-wing support from the Pracheachon. The Pracheachon on their part fielded five candidates for the elections. However, four of them withdrew, as they were prevented by the national police from holding any election rallies. When voting took place, the Sangkum won all seats in the national assembly.|$|E

Unsupervised in the medbay, Fennel sees the undead Delambre through a porthole and follows her outside. She strips naked, and he stands transfixed while she removes his helmet. He asphyxiates, and then she attaches an alien parasite to his head. Now under alien control, Fennel sends a transmission <b>to</b> his crewmates, <b>inviting</b> <b>them</b> over <b>to</b> the German ship.

40|$|We studied {{epidemiological}} {{aspects of}} recruitment of volunteers for a non-invasive urodynamic study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 9, 236 volunteers were invited by 20 general practitioners (GPs), using two different recruitment methods, i. e. by mail only, or during a subsequent {{visit to the}} GP's office. Factors influencing the response rates were analyzed. We also tested how much the recruited population of volunteers differed from the general population, by comparing it to another, proven representative study carried out earlier in 1, 662 subjects. RESULTS: In the recruited population the prostate volumes {{were not significantly different}} from the proven representative study, but the symptom score was statistically significantly higher, although the difference was so small it may be called clinically irrelevant. Recruitment of volunteers in two steps, i. e. asking <b>them</b> first <b>to</b> visit the GP's office, and <b>inviting</b> <b>them</b> there <b>to</b> visit the outpatient clinic, rather than directly <b>inviting</b> <b>them</b> (in writing) <b>to</b> the clinic seemed to lead to a higher response, although this effect could not be statistically discriminated from the difference in response rates between GPs. CONCLUSION: The population recruited was not urologically different from the general population. The response depended on age, being highest around the age of 60, and increased with social economic status. It also depended on the GP who recruited the subjects, and/or on the recruitment method...|$|R

5|$|The first {{conflict}} between the French and the Natchez took place in 1716, when the Governor of Louisiana, Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac, passed through Natchez territory and neglected to renew the alliance with the Natchez by smoking the peace calumet. The Natchez reacted to this slight by killing four French traders. Cadillac sent his lieutenant Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville to punish the Natchez. He deceived the Natchez leaders by <b>inviting</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> attend a parley, where he ambushed and captured them, and forced the Natchez to exchange their leaders for the culprits who had attacked the French. A number of random Natchez from the pro-British villages were executed. This caused French–Natchez relations to further deteriorate. As part {{of the terms of}} the peace accord following this First Natchez War, the Natchez promised to supply labor and materials {{for the construction of a}} fort for the French. The fort was named Fort Rosalie, and it was aimed at protecting the French trade monopoly in the region from British incursions.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{supporting}} characters was kept low to emphasize their individuality, and their personalities were left ambiguous {{to reinforce the}} desire for player immersion. The heroine Yuko Takao {{was intended to be}} a different type of character to previous main heroines, being a non-playable character from the beginning of story development. She was the only major non-playable character not to have her own Reason. The character of Lucifer designed was not a standard villain, but rather as a gentlemanly observer who sets tests for the player. To reflect his omnipotent status as God's opposite, he is portrayed in a number of forms, including a child and an old man. Alongside this, the staff wanted to portray demons not only as enemies but as characters the player could relate to and grow attached to when <b>inviting</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> their party. One of the key elements for demon designs recycled from earlier games was bringing them into the game and making them as true as possible to the original design while fitting into the game's art style.|$|E
