P.) properties of lubricating oils by using Four Ball <b>Extreme</b> <b>Pressure</b> <b>Oil</b> Testing Machine (F. B. E. P. O. T. M.) {{plays an important}} role in oil industry while selecting such oils as a lubricating media for testing various types of E. P. lubricating oils. Lubricating oils are needed to reduce frictional losses as well as to support working load and avoid metal to metal contact between the components working together for obtaining desired functions in machines. This F. B. E. P. O. T. M is utilized for finding the load carrying capacity and weld point of different types of lubricants/Oils fluids. Extreme Pressure (E. P.) properties like-Load wear Index,Weld Point, Non load are the basis of differentiation of Lubricating oils having low, medium and high level of extreme pressure properties. In this paper we find out or Evaluate Tribological (E. P.) properties i e. of load carrying capacity and weld point or various oils or lubricants used for various purposes. It‟s necessary to form a lubricating fluid film of low shear strength, then it is possible to decide the film breaking strength in other words load carrying capacity of oil can be calculated...|$|E

40|$|A {{coal-fired}} power plant operating in the western United States was experiencing short gearbox life in its coal pulverizing operation. The AGMA 6 EP (ISO 320) gear oil recommended by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) failed to provide adequate lubrication and protection based on oil analysis results and gearbox inspection after one year of operation. This was confirmed by excessive wear metals and lower viscosity in the used oil reports. Further analysis of the used <b>extreme</b> <b>pressure</b> (EP) gear <b>oil</b> indicated excessive buildup of particulate contaminants in the lubricant and depletion of the EP additive package. The particulate contamination consisted primarily of dirt/coal dust and metallic particulates being generated by bearing and gear tooth wear, and a chain reaction of excessive wear was taking place...|$|R

Physical parameters (Flash point, Pour Point, Viscosity index and Kinematic viscosity) and phosphorus contents {{were determined by}} standard test methods recommended by the American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM).

5000|$|Roto's {{downfall}} was the 2-3 range or 1-2 {{gear change}} {{because it is}} not only a huge ratio jump from 2-3 range or 1-2 shift from 2.93 to 1.56, but also there is no fluid slippage in the coupling because the coupling drains (4 tenths of a second) to engage or apply the front clutch and so the trans goes to full mechanical connection. The other downfall of Roto HydraMatic was the <b>extreme</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressures</b> in the small 8" [...] fluid coupling which caused transmission leaks. All HydraMatic transmissions suffer some shift quality with today's ATF fluid as Type [...] "A" [...] fluid is not available. The main ingredient of Type [...] "A" [...] was banned years ago, however Japanese cars that have CVT automatic's still use that ingredient in their special CVT fluid. That CVT fluid can only bought at the dealer. The ingredient is Whale oil.|$|R

Bearings (SKF 7204 BEP) were tested both with and without magnetite oxide (Fe 3 O 4) contamination. In order to study the interaction between contaminants and <b>extreme</b> <b>pressure</b> additives, the rolling element bearings were lubricated with two different greases: Grease without <b>extreme</b> <b>pressure</b> and grease containing sulphur-based <b>extreme</b> <b>pressure</b> additives. Further, {{the effect of the}} contamination–additive interaction on rolling bearing performance and monitoring signals (vibration and acoustic emission) was investigated. The obtained results indicate an advantage of <b>extreme</b> <b>pressure</b> additive in case of the investigated operating conditions. Furthermore, the use of <b>extreme</b> <b>pressure</b> additives decreased wear, surface roughness, vibration and acoustic emission for both test durations of 24 h and 168 h. The decrease of the acoustic emissions and the surface roughness parameter Rq in case of the tests with a duration of 168 h as high as 70 % and 60 %, respectively using <b>extreme</b> <b>pressure</b> additives in comparison with the plain grease was observed. The major cause for this reduction seems to be the interaction between contaminants and <b>extreme</b> <b>pressure</b> additives...|$|R

40|$|Exploitation of ultradeep, high <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> {{reservoirs}} {{is always}} associated with numerous risks, challenges, and obstacles. One {{of the most}} pronounced constraints in development of such fields {{is the number of}} wells, which is imposed by massively high cost of drilling. Low number of wells may lead to high pressure isolation regions left after primary production (pressure depletion) of the reservoir. Ultradeep reservoirs with high pressure are more prone to such leftover high pressure isolation regions due to their low permeable characteristic. These high pressure isolation regions can, subsequently, deteriorate the efficiency of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) as the injected fluid cannot access the residual oil in these regions. Therefore, well placement and inter-well spacing optimizations is of greater importance in ultradeep, high <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> reservoirs to ensure higher ultimate oil recovery at lower costs. Furthermore, due to high cost of development of ultradeep, high <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> reservoirs, the EOR strategy and commencement time for the selected EOR strategy are very critical. The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate how optimization of well placement, well spacing, and startup time for miscible CO 2 flooding can enhance the incremental and ultimate oil recoveries in an ultradeep, high <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> reservoir. To do this, a synthetic grid model was made to run different simulation scenarios on it. The model was initialized with rock and fluid properties within the range of those in the ultradeep, high pressure Wilcox formation in the Gulf of Mexico to ensure that it mimics an ultradeep, high <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> reservoir. The obtained results showed that optimization of well placement, well spacing, and commencement time for any EOR strategy such as miscible CO 2 flooding is very critical in the course of making a Field Development Plan (FDP) for an ultradeep, high <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> reservoir. The results, discussions, and conclusions were finally used by the author to shed light on potential further work on each of the aforementioned challenges in ultradeep, high <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> reservoirs such as Wilcox formation in the Gulf of Mexico. </p...|$|R
