5|$|Christianity {{has deep}} roots in the Western Isles, but owing mainly to the {{different}} allegiances of the clans in the past, {{the people in the}} northern islands (Lewis, Harris, North Uist) <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> <b>been</b> predominantly Presbyterian, and those of the southern islands (Benbecula, South Uist, Barra) predominantly Roman Catholic.|$|E
5|$|It is {{now known}} that at least some, and {{probably}} all, dromaeosaurids were covered in feathers, including large, vaned, wing and tail feathers. This development, first hypothesized in the mid-late 1980s and confirmed by fossil discoveries in 1999, represents {{a significant change in}} the way dromaeosaurids <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> <b>been</b> depicted in art and film.|$|E

5|$|These routes – {{spreading}} religion, {{trade and}} technology – <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> <b>been</b> {{vital to the}} growth of urban civilization. The extent of development of cities, and the level of their integration into a larger world system, has often been attributed to their position in various active transport networks.|$|E
5|$|Utica's neighborhoods <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> <b>been</b> {{defined by}} their residents, {{allowing}} them {{to develop their own}} individuality. Racial and ethnic groups, social and economic separation and the development of infrastructure and new means of transportation have shaped neighborhoods, with groups shifting between them as a result.|$|E

5|$|Cartography, {{the study}} and {{practice}} of map-making, and geography, {{the study of the}} lands, features, inhabitants and phenomena on Earth, <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> <b>been</b> the disciplines devoted to depicting Earth. Surveying, the determination of locations and distances, {{and to a lesser extent}} navigation, the determination of position and direction, have developed alongside cartography and geography, providing and suitably quantifying the requisite information.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus mahafaliensis is a bat in {{the genus}} Miniopterus {{that occurs in}} southwestern Madagascar. Populations of this species <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> <b>been</b> {{included}} in Miniopterus manavi, but molecular data published in 2008 and 2009 indicate that this supposed species in fact consists of five separate species, including the newly described M.mahafaliensis.

5|$|Oryzomys from Costa Rica <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> <b>been</b> {{referred}} to O.c.couesi, but Hanson and colleagues found that two specimens from Refugio Nacional de Vida Silvestre Mixto Maquenque, northeastern Costa Rica, differed {{as much from}} other O.couesi (11.93% Cytb sequence divergence) as O.couesi differed from the marsh rice rat (11.30%). They suggested that these animals represented a species distinct from O.couesi, but were unable to resolve the correct name for the species {{because they could not}} examine samples of dimidiatus or richmondi.|$|E

5|$|The raphines are {{sometimes}} separated {{as a distinct}} family Raphidae, and their affinities were for long uncertain. They were initially placed in the ratites due to their peculiar, flightlessness-related apomorphies, and a relationship to the Rallidae has also been suggested. Osteological and molecular data, however, agrees that placement in the Columbidae is more appropriate. Many different affinities <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> <b>been</b> suggested for the dodo, including {{that it was a}} small ostrich, a rail, an albatross, or a vulture.|$|E
5|$|United Armenia (classical , reformed: Միացյալ Հայաստան, translit. Miatsyal Hayastan), {{also known}} as Greater Armenia or Great Armenia, is an Armenian ethno-nationalist irredentist concept {{referring}} to areas within the traditional Armenian homeland—the Armenian Highland—which are currently or <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> <b>been</b> mostly populated by Armenians. The idea of what Armenians see as unification of their historical lands was prevalent throughout the 20th century and has been advocated by individuals, various organizations and institutions, including the nationalist parties Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF or Dashnaktsutyun) and Heritage, the ASALA and others.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, Cubzac {{served as}} a watchtower through the Four Sons of Amon castle. Different means of {{crossing}} the river in Cubzac <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> <b>been</b> used, from pontoon bridges and horse-powered ferries to steel and concrete bridges. Part of a vibrant wine region, Cubzac has several wine castles, including the Terrefort castle. It has developed its own sparkling wine, {{in what is now}} called the Café de Paris. The limestone quarries of Cubzac supplied for the typical white constructions found in Bordeaux and its region. Cubzac has two Monuments Historiques; the first is a painting in a church, the other is the ruins of the Four Sons of Amon castle.|$|E

5|$|Harbour {{porpoises}} <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> <b>been</b> kept in captivity, {{under the}} assumption that they would fare better than their dolphin counterparts due to their shallow-water habitats. Of the 150 harbour porpoises kept worldwide, nearly 100 were kept in Denmark. Nearly half of these died of diseases caught before they were captured, or damage sustained during capture and transit. Almost all died within 14 months. Breeding success has always been poor with porpoises, and there are only six recorded births (of a harbour porpoise and five finless porpoises). Lack of births in captivity is mainly due {{the fact that there were}} few breeding attempts, many were actually kept in isolation and those who were not were often not mature.|$|E
5|$|Most seabirds are colonial, and {{the reasons}} for colonial {{behaviour}} are assumed to be similar, if incompletely understood by scientists. Procellariids for the most part have weak legs and are unable to easily take off, making them highly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Most procellariid colonies are located on islands that <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> <b>been</b> free of mammals; for this reason some species cannot help but be colonial as they are limited to a few locations to breed. Even species that breed on continental Antarctica, such as the Antarctic petrel, are forced by habitat preference (snow-free north-facing rock) to breed in just a few locations.|$|E
5|$|The 1500m and mile run events <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> <b>been</b> some of {{the most}} prestigious track and field events. Swedish rivals Gunder Hägg and Arne Andersson broke each other's 1500m and mile world records on a number of {{occasions}} in the 1940s. The prominence of the distances were maintained by Roger Bannister, who (in 1954) was the first to run the long-elusive four-minute mile, and Jim Ryun's exploits served to popularise interval training. Races between British rivals Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett and Steve Cram characterised middle-distance running in the 1980s. From the 1990s onwards, North Africans such as Noureddine Morceli of Algeria and Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco came to dominate the 1500 and mile events.|$|E

5|$|The Outer Hebrides <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> <b>been</b> a {{very strong}} Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig) {{speaking}} area. Both the 1901 and 1921 census reported that all parishes were over 75% Gaelic speaking, including areas of high population density such as Stornoway. However, the Education (Scotland) Act 1872 mandated English-only education, and is now recognised as having dealt a major blow to the language. People still living can recall being beaten for speaking Gaelic in school. Nonetheless, by 1971 most areas were still more than 75% Gaelic speaking – {{with the exception of}} Stornoway, Benbecula and South Uist at 50-74%.|$|E
5|$|Thoroughbreds in the United States <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> <b>been</b> used {{not only}} for racing but also to improve other breeds. The early import Messenger was the {{foundation}} of the Standardbred, and Thoroughbred blood was also instrumental {{in the development of the}} American Quarter Horse. The foundation stallion of the Morgan breed is held by some to have been sired by a Thoroughbred. Between World War I and World War II, the U.S. Army used Thoroughbred stallions as part of their Remount Service, which was designed to improve the stock of cavalry mounts.|$|E
5|$|Around 120,000 {{species of}} fungi have been {{described}} by taxonomists, but the global biodiversity of the fungus kingdom is not fully understood. A 2017 estimate suggests there may be between 2.2 and 3.8 million species. In mycology, species <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> <b>been</b> distinguished {{by a variety of}} methods and concepts. Classification based on morphological characteristics, such as {{the size and shape of}} spores or fruiting structures, has traditionally dominated fungal taxonomy. Species may also be distinguished by their biochemical and physiological characteristics, such as their ability to metabolize certain biochemicals, or their reaction to chemical tests. The biological species concept discriminates species based on their ability to mate. The application of molecular tools, such as DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, to study diversity has greatly enhanced the resolution and added robustness to estimates of genetic diversity within various taxonomic groups.|$|E
