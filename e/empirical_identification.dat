40|$|Common {{precursors}} {{of financial}} crises are credit expansion and rising leverage. These fuel bubbles {{that result in}} a severe economic downturns when they burst. However, existing literature on bubbles under rationality lacks explanatory power, and this paper argues {{that this may be}} partly due to an implicit focus on closed economies. We study risk-shifting bubbles in symmetric open economies with three different investor types: fundamentalists, speculators and value investors. In open economies, credit bubbles tend to be ‘displaced ’ abroad, have higher incidence, be larger, and last longer relative to the closed economy setting. We find that underpricing of default options embedded in loan agreements is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for risk-shifting incentives to emerge. We develop a simple <b>empirical</b> <b>identification</b> procedure of risk-shifting bubbles funded from overseas. An example of <b>empirical</b> <b>identification</b> is performed on New Zealand-Japan country pair, and we find that New Zealand’s housing market has experienced a risk-shifting bubble funded from Japan in 2001 - 2003...|$|E
40|$|In {{the late}} 1980 s/early 1990 s {{the concept of}} {{leadership}} {{was introduced in the}} study of international regimes to describe the role negotiating parties some-times would take on to craft agreement. The concept seemed to grasp an essential feature of multilateral cooperative efforts: that parties can be differentiated by {{the extent to which they}} are capable of, and willing to, take on a particular responsibility of guiding other parties in directions that could lead to joint solutions. The concept of leadership has only to a small extent been subjected to critical analytical and conceptual discussion. In this article we revisit the concept by asking: What are the characteristic features of leadership in international negotiations? Our analysis shows that current conceptualizations of leadership are associated with significant ambiguities that make it hard to distinguish leadership behavior from other types of bargaining behavior and that these problems are reproduced in <b>empirical</b> <b>identifications</b> of this mode of bargaining behavior.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{corporate}} governance and managers {{on the value}} of companies has received great attention in the recent public debate. In the academic research, this increased attention has been associated with an effort to develop finer conceptual frameworks and analytical techniques to assess how governance and financial characteristics influence corporate policies and profitability. While theoretical models represent a successful approach under specific hypotheses, the econometric analysis of corporate governance and managerial characteristics has proven to be extremely challenging. Because governance and managerial characteristics are equilibrium outcomes largely determined by the firm itself, it is methodologically difficult to separate out their determinants from their consequences to infer causal effects. Since its infancy the empirical corporate governance and corporate finance research has faced this problem, which is often responsible for mixed empirical results. In my dissertation, I adopt a common methodological framework developed in the “program evaluation” literature to shed new light on the effects of governance and managerial characteristics on a variety of corporate policies and, ultimately, firm performance. In particular, I estimate a class of difference-in-differences models deriving the <b>empirical</b> <b>identifications</b> from policy changes that generate “quasi-natural experiments”...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{identifies}} the contemporaneous relationship between {{exchange rate policy}} and liability dollarization using three different definitions of dollarization. The presence of endogeneity makes the <b>empirical</b> <b>identification</b> elusive. We use identification through heteroskedasticity to solve the endogeneity problem in the present context (Rigobon, 2003). While we find that countries with high liability dollarization (external, public, or financial) {{tend to be more}} actively involved in exchange rate stabilization operations, we do not find evidence that floating, by itself, promotes de-dollarization.

40|$|When the {{dimension}} of the vector of estimated parameters increases, simulation based methods become impractical, {{because the number of}} draws required for estimation grows exponentially with the number of parameters. In simulation methods, the lack of <b>empirical</b> <b>identification</b> when the number of parameters increases is usually known as the “curse of dimensionality” in the simulation methods. We investigate this problem {{in the case of the}} random coefficients Logit model. We compare the traditional Maximum Simulated Likelihood (MSL) method with two alternative estimation methods: the Expectation–Maximization (EM) and the Laplace Approximation (HH) methods that do not require simulation. We use Monte Carlo experimentation to investigate systematically the performance of the methods under different circumstances, including different numbers of variables, sample sizes and structures of the variance–covariance matrix. Results show that indeed MSL suffers from lack of <b>empirical</b> <b>identification</b> as {{the dimension}}ality grows while EM deals much better with this estimation problem. On the other hand, the HH method, although not being simulation-based, showed poor performance with large dimensions, principally because of the necessity of inverting large matrices. The results also show that when MSL is empirically identified this method seems superior to EM and HH in terms of ability to recover the true parameters and estimation tim...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} principles underlying {{the arrangement of}} elements into solid compounds with an enormous variety of crystal structures are still largely unknown. This study presents a general overview of the structure types appearing in an important subset of the solid compounds, i. e., binary and ternary compounds of the 6 A column oxides, sulfides and selenides. It contains an analysis of these compounds, including the prevalence of various structure types, their symmetry properties, compositions, stoichiometries and unit cell sizes. It is found that these compound families include preferred stoichiometries and structure types that may reflect both their specific chemistry and research bias in the available <b>empirical</b> data. <b>Identification</b> of non-overlapping gaps and missing stoichiometries in these structure populations {{may be used as}} guidance in the search for new materials.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{identification}} of a simultaneous equation model involving duration measures. It proposes a game theoretic model in which durations are determined by strategic agents. In the absence of strategic motives, the model delivers {{a version of the}} generalized accelerated failure time model. In its most general form, the system resembles a classical simultaneous equation model in which endogenous variables interact with observable and unobservable exogenous components to characterize a certain economic environment. In this paper, the endogenous variables are the individually chosen equilibrium durations. Even though a unique solution to the game is not always attainable in this context, the structural elements of the economic system are shown to be semiparametrically point identified. We also present a brief discussion of estimation ideas and a set of simulation studies on the model. Keywords: duration, <b>empirical</b> games, <b>identification...</b>|$|R

While there are some solid and intuitive indentification ideas in these papers, we argue that the techniques, particularly those of Levinsohn and Petrin, suffer from collinearity problems which we believe cast doubt on the methodology. We then suggest alternative methodologies which make use of the ideas in these papers, but do not suffer from these collinearity problems. ...|$|E

Design Repeated cross-sectional survey study, comprising a longitudinal cohort, conducted in 2008 and 2009. Setting Secondary schools in the Netherlands. Participants Two large samples of Dutch schoolchildren (aged 13 – 16 years). Measurements Compulsive internet use scale, weekly hours of online gaming and psychosocial variables. Findings This study confirms the existence {{of a small group of}} addicted online gamers (3 %), representing about 1. 5 % of all children aged 13 – 16 years in the Netherlands. Although these gamers report addiction-like problems, relationships with decreased psychosocial health were less evident.

40|$|Worldwide {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs) {{pollution}} {{is due to}} complex mixtures with high number of congeners, making the determination of total PCBs in the environment an open challenge. Because the bulk of PCBs production was made of Aroclor mixtures, this analysis is usually faced by the <b>empirical</b> mixture <b>identification</b> via visual inspection of the chromatogram. However, the identification reliability is questionable, as patterns in real samples are strongly affected by the frequent occurrence {{of more than one}} mixture. Our approach is based on the determination of a limited number of congeners chosen to enable objective criteria for Aroclor identification, summing up the advantages of congener-specific analysis with the ones of total PCBs determination. A quantitative relationship is established between congeners and any single mixture, or mixtures combination, leading to the identification of the actual contamination composition. The approach, due to its generality, allows the use of different sets of congeners and any technical mixture, including the non-Aroclor ones. The results confirm that PCB environmental pollution in northern Italy is based on Aroclor. Our methodology represents an important tool to understand the source and fate of the PCBs contamination...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{theory of}} {{cognitive}} dissonance [1] concentrates on creating knowledge about important psychological processes of individuals. Specifically, {{it focuses on}} the relationships among cognitions that are elements of knowledge that people have about their behaviors, attitudes, perceptions, beliefs, feelings, or environments. Since human nature is the main subject of all social sciences, the theory has awakened interest and led to significant research in different academic domains. This study makes a thorough analysis of the theory's application in psychology, management, and marketing fields with an aim to assess {{the contribution of the}} theory to the development of knowledge in these areas. It is observed that the theory is commonly used by marketers to explain consumer behavior while its adoption in the management field to examine human related issues is considerably underdeveloped. Accordingly, the aim {{of this paper is to}} extend the literature on cognitive dissonance by discovering the under-investigated areas and pave the way for further theoretical and <b>empirical</b> research. <b>Identification</b> of existing gaps and suggestions for further scholarly inquiries are also believed to contribute to the recent efforts to regenerate interest to topic and to boost its generalizability through its greater utilization in the development of knowledge...|$|R
