5|$|Despite {{consisting}} {{mostly of}} hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The temperature, pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers.|$|E

5|$|A Fresh Start is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film {{is the story of}} Jim, a chauffeur, who is fired from his job for drunkenness. Jim becomes a tramp, but decides to reform after a little girl orders her butler to give him food. He encounters her again at the zoo and notices that two men are following the girl and her parents. Jim uncovers a plot to kidnap her and takes the place of their chauffeur. Jim then drives the kidnappers to the police station and secures a new position as the family's chauffeur. According to a trade review, the actual kidnapping scene and where Jim overpowers the villain's chauffeur is not actually depicted. The reviewer also stated the strength of the production <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plot, but in the staging and photography. The film was released on September 2, 1910, and it likely had a wide national release. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|A neutron {{spectrometer}} {{on board the}} Lunar Prospector spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to {{the northern and southern}} lunar poles, including the crater Shackleton. At the end of this mission in July 1999, the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth-based telescopes an impact-generated plume containing water vapor. The impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor, and this may be an indication that the hydrogen <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of hydrated minerals, or that the impact site did not contain any ice. Alternatively, {{it is possible that the}} crash did not excavate deeply enough into the regolith to liberate significant quantities of water vapor.|$|E
5|$|A seizure {{underwater}} {{requires that}} the diver {{be brought to the}} surface as soon as practicable. Although for many years the recommendation has been not to raise the diver during the seizure itself, owing to the danger of arterial gas embolism (AGE), {{there is some evidence that}} the glottis does not fully obstruct the airway. This has led to the current recommendation by the Diving Committee of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society that a diver should be raised during the seizure's clonic (convulsive) phase if the regulator <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> diver's mouth– as the danger of drowning is then greater than that of AGE– but the ascent should be delayed until the end of the clonic phase otherwise. Rescuers ensure that their own safety is not compromised during the convulsive phase. They then ensure that where the victim's air supply is established it is maintained, and carry out a controlled buoyant lift. Lifting an unconscious body is taught by most diver training agencies. Upon reaching the surface, emergency services are always contacted as there is a possibility of further complications requiring medical attention. The U.S. Navy has procedures for completing the decompression stops where a recompression chamber is not immediately available.|$|E
5|$|As {{the project}} name suggests, the mobile robot is a cobot – a {{collaborative}} robot.

5|$|As with {{cultural}} studies, media {{study is a}} distinct discipline that owes to the convergence of sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular, literary criticism and critical theory. Though the production process or the critique of aesthetic forms <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> remit of sociologists, analyses of socializing factors, such as ideological effects and audience reception, stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline per se, but the media is a common and often-indispensable topic.|$|E
5|$|Bryan Cogman, {{initially}} {{a script}} {{coordinator for the}} series, was promoted to producer for the fifth season. Cogman, who wrote at least one episode {{for the first five}} seasons, is the only other writer in the writers' room with Benioff and Weiss. Before his promotion, Vanessa Taylor (a writer during the second and third seasons) worked closely with Benioff and Weiss. Dave Hill joined the writing staff for the fifth season after working as an assistant to Benioff and Weiss. Although Martin <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> writers' room, he reads the script outlines and makes comments.|$|E
5|$|Calling {{a correct}} letter earns the value before the {{corresponding}} flipper, {{multiplied by the}} number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle. Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money to keep doing so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E

5|$|For the sequel, Mane, McDowell, Taylor-Compton, Harris, Moon Zombie, and Dourif {{returned}} to the roles of Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, Deborah Myers, and Sheriff Brackett, respectively. Daeg Faerch, who portrayed a young Michael Myers in the 2007 remake, was set to reprise his role for Halloween II. By the time production was getting started for the sequel Faerch had grown {{too big for the}} part. Zombie had to recast the role, much to his own dismay, because Faerch's physical maturity did not fit what was in the script. Although Faerch <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sequel, the first trailer for Halloween II contained images of Faerch. Zombie pointed out that those images were test shots done and were not intended to be in either the trailer or the film.|$|E
5|$|Giraldus Cambrensis wrote a Life of St Æthelberht, {{probably}} at Hereford during the 1190s. He quotes an incident from Asser {{that occurred during}} the reign of Offa of Mercia, who died in 796. This incident <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surviving copies of the manuscript. It is possible that Giraldus had access to a different copy of Asser's work. It is also possible that he is quoting a different work by Asser, which is otherwise unknown, or even that Giraldus is making up the reference to Asser to support his story. The latter is at least plausible, since Giraldus is not always regarded as a trustworthy writer.|$|E

5|$|Hydrogen, as atomic H, is {{the most}} {{abundant}} chemical element in the universe, making up 75% of normal matter by mass and more than 90% by number of atoms. (Most {{of the mass of}} the universe, however, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of chemical-element type matter, but rather is postulated to occur as yet-undetected forms of mass such as dark matter and dark energy.) This element is found in great abundance in stars and gas giant planets. Molecular clouds of H2 are associated with star formation. Hydrogen plays a vital role in powering stars through the proton-proton reaction and the CNO cycle nuclear fusion.|$|E
5|$|In Apur Panchali (the Bengali {{translation}} of , 1994), Ray {{wrote that he}} had omitted many of the novel's characters {{and that he had}} rearranged some of its sequences to make the narrative better as cinema. Changes include Indir's death, which occurs early in the novel at a village shrine in the presence of adults, while in the film Apu and Durga find her corpse in the open. The scene of Apu and Durga running {{to catch a glimpse of}} the train <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novel, in which neither child sees the train, although they try. Durga's fatal fever is attributed to a monsoon downpour in the film, but is unexplained in the novel. The ending of the film—the family's departure from the village—is not the end of the novel.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, binary search, {{also known}} as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds {{the position of a}} target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> array.|$|E

He learns that the man in the picture was extremely wealthy and lucky for a short period, before he died with a giant oversized penis. Mulder believes the woman in the picture is responsible for everything, and determines she is a jinniyah, or a female jinn. Mulder goes to the Stokes residence and asks Leslie to hand her over, presuming her to be kept in a box. It turns out, however, that she <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> box, but back in the storage facility, where Mulder also finds pictures of the jinniyah next to Benito Mussolini in the 1930s and next to Richard Nixon in the 1960s, two men that had a lot of power and lost it in a bad way.|$|E
5|$|The god Hermes <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, {{but in the}} novel, he is {{responsible}} for informing Athena that Kratos is committing suicide. New characters include Coeus, the First Officer of Kratos' ship, and the two servants of Medusa: Jurr and a blind man. The twins encountered in the sex mini-game are revealed to be the daughters of Aphrodite named Zora and Lora. The book also explains how certain creatures of the mythology that were slain by heroes are, apparently, still alive. For example, Zeus recollects that Hercules slew the Hydra, and Athena confirms this, but informs Zeus that the new Hydra is a newborn spawn of the Titans Typhon and Echidna, and was released by Ares.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of Proto-Central-Semitic shows {{significant changes}} compared with Proto-Semitic, especially in its verbs, and {{is much like}} in Classical Arabic. Nouns in the singular were usually declined in three cases: /-u/ (nominative), /-a/ (accusative) or /-i/ (genitive). In some circumstances (but never in the construct state), nouns also took a final nasal after the case ending: nunation (final /-n/) occurred in some languages, mimation (final /-m/) in others. The original meaning of this marker is uncertain. In Classical Arabic, final /-n/ on nouns indicates indefiniteness and disappears when the noun is preceded by a definite article or otherwise becomes definite in meaning. In other languages, final /-n/ may be present whenever a noun <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> construct state. Old Canaanite had mimation, of uncertain meaning, in an occurrence of the word urušalemim (Jerusalem) as given in an Egyptian transcription.|$|E
