40|$|The {{geometry}} of ethylenedioxy-tetrathiafulvalene, EDO-TTF, {{plays an important}} role in the metal-insulator transition in the charge transfer salt (EDO-TTF) (2) PF 6. The planar and off-planar geometrical conformations of the EDO-TTF molecules are explained using an extended <b>Debye</b> polarizability <b>model</b> for the bond angle. The geometrical structure of EDO-TTF is dictated by its four sulfur bond angles and these are, in turn, determined by the polarizability of the sulfur atoms.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{two significant}} research achievements. Part I describes {{the development of}} a novel System on Chip (SoC) hardware neural network simulator for diverse and biologically accurate neural network simulations. This work seeks to contribute to research in neuroscience which requires large and fast simulations of biological nervous systems. The presented embedded FPGA neural network simulator utilizes time-multiplexed hardware neuron models to simulate thousands of complex biological neurons on embedded hardware. A high level synthesis method has been developed to automatically convert high level neuron and synapse models to synthesizable VHDL hardware models and automatically implement and test the models on FPGA hardware. The accuracy of the converted models has been validated by comparison to reference software simulations. The state of the art in neural network simulations is presented. A new FPGA-based neural network simulation platform has been designed, implemented and verified. The high level synthesis method has also been implemented as part of the Si elegans platform which aims to simulate the nervous system of the Caenorhabditis elegans organism in FPGA hardware. Part II of this thesis examines the use of Ultra Wideband Radar as a bladder-state sensing technique for the potential application in urinary incontinence support. The research has explored and developed efficient and practical methods to simulate radar signal propagation in biological tissues. A genetic algorithm has been developed to fit arbitrary tissue dielectric <b>Debye</b> <b>models.</b> This algorithm has been applied to all relevant tissues in the human pelvis, and has been used to provide a database of <b>Debye</b> tissue dielectric <b>models</b> for a large selection of human tissues. The thesis combines the tissue dielectric <b>Debye</b> <b>models</b> with anatomically accurate models of the human pelvis (one male and one female), derived from IT 2 ̆ 7 IS Foundation Magnetic Resonance images. Electromagnetic simulations of UWB-radar passing through an anatomically-plausible bladder growth model have been performed, to acquire simulated bladder volume measurements.

The proposed FDTD schemes incorporate {{an extension of}} the perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundary condition (ABC) to three-dimensional (3 -D) cylindrical coordinates. Dispersion on the media is modeled by using the piecewise-linear recursive convolution (PLRC) algorithm, accounting for multiterm Lorentz and/or <b>Debye</b> <b>models.</b> Split-field and unsplit (anisotropic medium) formulations of the cylindrical PML-PLRC-FDTD schemes are implemented and compared in the time domain.
