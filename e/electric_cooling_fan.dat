The design set the pattern for future Audi-developed Volkswagen Group V8 engines. In addition to using an all-aluminum alloy cylinder block (when the established material was grey cast iron), the camshafts were driven using a hybrid method. A rubber/kevlar toothed timing belt, driven {{from the front of}} the crankshaft operated only the exhaust camshaft in each bank. [...] The inlet camshafts were then operated via a simplex roller chain from the exhaust camshaft – the right bank, (cylinders 1–4) at the rear of the engine, and the left bank (cylinders 5–8) at the front of the engine, immediately behind the timing belt. This method reduced the complexity of the timing belt layout, and as a result, required fewer components, such as idler rollers and guides, and lead to easier and less costly maintenance of the timing belt and associated components.

50|$|Under the skin, {{the layout}} of the R16 is similar to the Citroën Traction Avant - front-wheel drive, engine mounted inline behind the transmission. torsion bar suspension, and column mounted shift. In {{addition}} the car had an aluminum engine and an <b>electric</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>fan,</b> both technical innovations.|$|E
5000|$|The first engine {{used in the}} {{original}} 99 was a four-cylinder in-line engine which was tilted at 45 degrees. The 1709 cc Triumph-sourced engine produced [...] SAE gross at 5500 rpm.

2500|$|The {{electrical}} system was completely revised for 2008.

50|$|An {{internal}} fan-cooled {{electric motor}} (colloquially, fan-cooled motor) is a self <b>cooling</b> <b>electric</b> motor. <b>Fan</b> <b>cooled</b> motors feature an axial fan {{attached to the}} rotor of the motor (usually on the opposite end as the output shaft) that spins with the motor, providing increased airflow to the motor's internal and external parts which aids in cooling.|$|R
50|$|The coolant {{temperature}} sensor is {{used to measure the}} temperature of the engine coolant of an internal combustion engine. The readings from this sensor are then fed back to the engine control unit (ECU), which uses this data to adjust the fuel injection and ignition timing. On some vehicles the sensor may also be used to switch on the <b>electric</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>fan.</b> The data may also be used to provide readings for a {{coolant temperature}} gauge on the dashboard.|$|E
5000|$|The 4.2-litre engine {{produced}} the same power as the 3.8-litre (...) and same top speed (150 mph), but increased torque approximately 10% from 240 to 283 lbft Nm. Acceleration remained {{pretty much the}} same and 0 to 60 mph times were around 6.4 seconds for both engines, but maximum power was now reached at 5,400rpm instead of 5,500rpm on the 3.8-litre. That all meant better throttle response for drivers that did not want to shift down gears. [...] The 4.2-litres block was completely redesigned, made longer to accommodate 5mm larger bores, and the crankshaft modified to use newer bearings. Other engine upgrades included a new alternator/generator and an <b>electric</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> for the radiator.|$|E
5000|$|The {{internal}} combustion engine cooling thermostat maintains {{the temperature of the}} engine near its optimum operating temperature by regulating the flow of coolant to an air cooled radiator. This regulation is now carried out by an internal thermostat. Conveniently, both the sensing element of the thermostat and its control valve may be placed at the same location, allowing the use of a simple self-contained non-powered thermostat as the primary device for the precise control of engine temperature. Although most vehicles now have a temperature-controlled <b>electric</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>fan,</b> [...] "the unassisted air stream can provide sufficient cooling up to 95% of the time" [...] and so such a fan is not the mechanism for primary control of the internal temperature.|$|E

Specifically, three technical components are proposed to implement the methodology. First of all, a generic health index system is proposed to represent the health degradation of engineering systems. Next, a Copula-based modeling is proposed to build statistical relationship between failure time and the time realizations at specified degradation levels. Finally, a sampling approach is proposed to estimate the failure time and remaining useful life (RUL) of on-line testing units.

5000|$|The {{modifications}} {{made to the}} 2008 {{model year}} car were enough for Chrysler to make it distinct from the first SRT-10, and the 2008 model became known as Gen IV, {{just in time for}} release with Chevrolet's [...] Corvette ZR1. Another notable change was the reworking of the exhaust system; previous third-generation Vipers had their exhaust crossover under the seats which resulted in a large amount of heat going into the cockpit, which was done initially to help improve the car's exhaust note, since the first 2 generations of Viper, which had no crossover, were criticized for their lackluster exhaust notes. The 2008 Viper exhaust utilized a new exhaust system with no crossover, reducing the heat that enters the cockpit.The electrical system was completely revised for 2008.

40|$|Article history: Because {{of their}} longer {{operating}} times and larger size relative to conventional fans, the cooling fans mounted in buses consume larger amounts of energy. Most of the cooling fans mounted {{in a bus}} {{are connected to the}} engine by a viscous clutch. A viscous cooling fan’s speed is determined by its fluid temperature, which is affected by the air flow through the radiator. The fan does not react immediately to the coolant temperature and in doing so causes unnecessary energy consumption. Therefore, the fuel economy of buses using viscous fans can be improved by changing to an <b>electric</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> design, which can be actively controlled. In addition, electric power consumption is increased by using electric cooling fans. Thus, when electric fans are applied in conjunction with the alternator management system (AMS), the fuel economy is further enhanced. In this study, simulations were performed to predict coolant temperature and cooling fan speeds. Simulations were performed for both viscous and electric cooling fans, and power consumption was calculated. Additionally, fuel economy was calculated applying both the alternator management system and the <b>electric</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>fan...</b>|$|E

Three popular {{features}} introduced on the '78 pace car replicas made it into this year’s production: the new bucket seats, {{the front and rear}} spoiler package, and the glass roof panels. The new lightweight “high back” seats were made standard equipment. The new seats had better side bolster, provided easier access to the rear storage area, and the seat pair resulted in a weight reduction of about 24pounds. The bolt-on front and rear spoilers were offered as an option and nearly 7,000 cars were ordered so equipped. Functionally, the spoilers decreased drag by about 15% and increased fuel economy by about a half-mile per gallon. A bigger hit were the glass mirror-tint roof panels, now a regular option, with nearly 15,000 cars so fitted despite their costing $365. All T-tops were now wired into the standard anti-theft alarm system. Tungsten-halogen high-beam headlights became standard as did an AM-FM radio, {{and for the first time}} a cassette tape player could be added as a $234 option. Heavy duty shock absorbers could now be ordered without the full Gymkhana suspension.

Noteworthy is that about 82% of the cars were ordered with manual transmissions in 1968. In '79, less than 20% of the cars were delivered with manual gearboxes. This year reached an all-time high in Corvette popularity. Production hit its peak in 1979 at 53,807, a record that stands to this day.|$|R
