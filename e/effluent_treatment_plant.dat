40|$|Background and Purpose: Parabens are a {{group of}} Para-hydroxy Benzoic acid alkyl esters which {{extensively}} used as preservative in personal care products. Parabens have been recently found in wastewater, rivers, soil and dust. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study aimed to Monitor the occurrence of parabens from selected wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> (Shahrak Ghods and south of Tehran) and evaluate the performance of different treatment methods for removing these compounds. Methods: In this study, the samples from influent and effluent were collected from Shahrak Ghods and South of Tehran wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> as Seasonal and Three samples per season. Concentration of Para-hydroxy Benzoic acid esters was determined by HPLC, CECIL, 4100 at 242 nm. Result: After sampling in the different seasons from the west and south <b>treatment</b> <b>plants,</b> two selective paraben concentrations (Methyl paraben and Ethyl paraben) were measured. The results showed that average concentration of Methyl paraben (MeP) and Ethyl paraben) EtP(respectively were 740. 7 and 277. 7 ng/L in the Influent and 179. 3 and 45. 8 ng/L in the effluent of Shahrak Ghods <b>treatment</b> <b>plant.</b> Also, the average concentration of MeP and EtP respectively were 835. 3 and 295. 3 ng/L in Influent and 132. 8 and 29. 7 ng/L in the effluent of South of Tehran <b>treatment</b> <b>plant.</b> In the next step, Risk assessment of <b>effluent</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> discharging to environment with comparing the studies was done. According to the paraben concentration in the <b>effluent</b> of both <b>treatment</b> <b>plants,</b> discharge of <b>effluent</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> whit selective contaminants, have little biological effects on ecosystems. Conclusions: The removal efficiency of Shahrak Ghods <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> in removing parabens, was lower than the South of Tehran. But the effluent quality of both <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> was less than the Effluent discharge standard. So both of <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> have appropriate performance to removal contaminants...|$|R

50|$|As per {{a report}} by CRISIL, {{prepared}} in February 2011, ensuring Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD), will primarily affect the operational costs of dyeing and bleaching units, increasing it by 7% to 10%. Eventually, by complying with the above order, Tiruppur became the first textile cluster in India to achieve Zero Liquid Discharge in their units. Both the Common <b>Effluent</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Plant</b> and Individual <b>Effluent</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Plant</b> are in place to treat effluents. Farmers in Tiruppur and its hinterland, who have faced {{the brunt of the}} indiscriminate discharge of industrial effluents into the water bodies for the past many decades, are yet again becoming concerned. Untreated effluents, mostly containing dyes and chemicals in high concentration, are now seen let off clandestinely once again in large quantities through storm water drains into water bodies or into open areas with the discharge mostly happening during the early morning hours or during rain.|$|E

40|$|This article {{develops}} {{an economic}} model of environmental technology adoption decisions. The model is applied econometrically to {{the diffusion of}} biological waste-water <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> in the Dutch food and beverage industry. It shows {{that it is possible}} to explain the overall diffusion pattern of biological waste-water <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> in terms of a rational choice model in which prospective adopters trade off the costs of <b>effluent</b> <b>treatment</b> against the savings on effluent tax payments. Effluent charges are shown to be a significant positive factor in the timing of adoption of biological <b>effluent</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants.</b> This result is brought out by both the rational choice and the epidemic models. None of the models however can explain year-to-year changes in the ownership of biological waste-water <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> during the 1974 â€“ 91 period, which suggests that there are other factors, not included in the model, that affect the timing of adoption.
