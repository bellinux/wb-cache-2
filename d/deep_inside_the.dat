5|$|During final testing, {{engineers}} detected {{that the}} spacecraft's X band (NATO H/I/J bands) communications antenna was transmitting {{only a tiny}} fraction of the power that it should. Thermal imaging showed that the waveguide to the antenna, <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> spacecraft, was very hot. Clearly that was where the missing power was being dissipated. The waveguide could not normally be inspected or repaired without major disassembly of the satellite, which would have required a return to the facilities in Europe and resulted in a major delay to the launch. To avoid doing this, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an endoscope. The surgeon, Tatiana Zykova, discovered that two pieces of ferrite were lodged in the tube, and was able to remove both of them. Engineers were able to assist the removal of the second one with a magnet. It was determined that the ferrite had come from an absorption load installed <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> antenna, which was intended to improve its performance. Some ferrite (the remaining stump of this load) was removed from inside the base of the antenna in order to prevent any further debris falling into the waveguide.|$|E

40|$|In {{non-ferrous}} metallurgy the {{refractory life}} is application dependent, typically going from several months up to 2 years or more. Slag engineering {{is widely used}} to reduce the dissolution rate of a refractory lining by forming a solid protection layer at the slag-lining interface, thereby increasing the lining's lifetime. The non-ferrous slag in this paper is engineered to form a protective spinel layer. This phase, however, only forms near and at the slag-lining interface, while <b>deeper</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> sample forsterite grains are detected, resulting in direct contact between the still unsaturated slag and the magnesia-chromite refractory phases. At this position the MgO dissolution increases with a factor 3 – 4 compared with the slag-refractory interface, attacking the bonding between grains and decreasing the brick's mechanical strength. As this happens <b>deeper</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> sample, the spalling risk increases.

M. inquilina occurs in colonies with M. vindex and M. nigriceps, found in soil, under logs and flat rocks in woodland. They are commonly found in granite outcrops and wooded areas, with trees such as Corymbia calophylla, Acacia acuminata and a large unidentified species of Allocasuarina (possibly Allocasuarina huegeliana) present.

These lemurs are also significant pollinators of the traveller's tree (Ravenala madagascariensis).

5|$|As {{with many}} other Ficus species, the {{community}} of wasps inside the figs of F. rubiginosa is made up mostly of pollinator wasps. These develop <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> syconium, presumably protected there from parasites. Also present are much smaller numbers of other wasp species, which do not pollinate the fig. At least fourteen species have been recorded, of which four—two each belonging to the genera Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis—are common while others are rare. Investigation of F. rubiginosa syconia found that the fig seeds and parasitic wasps develop closer {{to the wall of}} the syconium. The wasps of the genera Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis are parasitic and are around {{the same size as the}} pollinator species. Their larvae are thought to feed on the larvae of the pollinator wasp. Male Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis wasps fight other males of the same species when they encounter each other in a F. rubiginosa fig. Several genera of uncommon larger wasp species enter the immature figs before other wasps and induce galls, which may impact on numbers of pollinator wasps in the fig later. An example of this is Pseudidarnes minerva, a metallic green wasp species.|$|E
5|$|With the game's {{momentum}} now {{firmly in}} their favor, the Virginia Tech defense stopped Kansas' offense on three straight plays, forcing another Kansas punt. The kick traveled 62yards and was recovered at the Virginia Tech 18-yard line. Virginia Tech's offense, despite the poor field position, moved quickly, {{partly due to}} a 15-yard pass interference penalty against Kansas. Sean Glennon completed a controversial 37-yard pass to tight end Greg Boone to drive the Hokies deep into Kansas territory. Initially, the pass {{appeared to have been}} intercepted by a Kansas defender, but subsequent replays revealed that Boone had wrested possession of the ball away from the defender. Three rushes <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> Kansas red zone netted the Hokies just nine more yards, setting up a fourth-and-one scenario for the Virginia Tech offense. Rather than risk a failed fourth-down conversion, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer sent in kicker Jud Dunlevy to attempt a 25-yard field goal. During the kick, however, Kansas defender Joe Mortensen rushed through the Virginia Tech line and blocked the kick, denying the Hokies three points and preserving a 1714 Kansas lead with 6:31 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

Curly Brace has also been thrown into the Labyrinth and they cooperate to escape. Balrog helps them to move the boulder blocking the exit, revealing his kind nature. The pair find and defeat the Core, a magical creature whose power keeps the island afloat. However, the Doctor steps in to save it before the island collapses. Depending on certain conditions, the player may rescue Curly Brace, who had sacrificed her air tank to save the player character. When he returns to Mimiga Village, he finds that the Doctor has captured the Mimigas. In the Egg Corridor, Kazuma offers the player a choice to escape the island with him using a Sky Dragon, leading to an alternate ending in which the Doctor conquers the surface world while Kazuma and the player hide in the mountains. The player may instead choose to confront the Doctor and destroy the island's Core, which would return the Mimigas to normal. The player scales the outer wall of the island to reach the Plantation where the Doctor is using the Mimigas as slave laborers to grow red flowers. The Doctor's servants capture the player and place him in a jail cell with Sue. She is taken away before the player wakes up, but her letter reveals that the Doctor {{was a member of}} the research expedition that included Sue's family and Professor Booster, but he betrayed them once he found the Demon Crown.

40|$|To have {{a robust}} {{smelting}} process {{it is essential}} to be able to rely on a long refractory life. In case of Cu-smelters, life times of two and more years can be obtained. In these processes a fayalite slag is used. However, in processes operated with a PbO slag, the refractory life time is often lower. A major difference between both slags lies in the infiltration behavior of the slag; PbO slags can infiltrate the porous lining much deeper, attacking a larger part of the lining. In this paper the chemical degradation of magnesia-chromite refractory material in contact with a deeply infiltrating synthetic PbO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -“Fe 2 O 3 “ based slag is investigated. The results indicate the formation of two new phases <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> refractory sample: (1) a new spinel phase, rich in aluminum and iron, forming near the contact surface with the bath and (2) a forsterite (Mg 2 SiO 4) phase forming <b>deeper</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> sample. Unlike forsterite, the new spinel phase forms a dense protective layer, limiting the dissolution of the MgO into the liquid slag. The main dissolution of the lining does therefore not occur at the first contact area between the refractory lining and the unsaturated slag but <b>deeper</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> sample when the protective layer is no longer formed. status: publishe...|$|R
