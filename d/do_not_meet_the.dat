5|$|As of 2011, {{there were}} 335 mares and 51 stallions {{registered}} with the Irish registry, which included 59 new foals that year. Herd numbers have steadily increased since registrations began in 2005. These numbers make the Kerry Bog Pony third in population numbers among Irish breeds, behind the Connemara pony and the Irish Draught. Despite the increasing numbers, the breed is still considered to be critically endangered by the Equus Survival Trust. The horses are administered by the Kerry Bog Pony Co-Operative Society of Ireland (formerly the Kerry Bog Pony Society), {{which is based in}} Ireland with a branch in Great Britain. Inspections are required before ponies are allowed into the studbook. The book is divided into four classes: Class 1 ponies meet all requirements, Class 2 ponies <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> height requirement, Class 3 ponies <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> color requirements, and Class 4 ponies have yet to submit to an official inspection. The breed association has hosted an annual breed show and sale in Glenbeigh, County Kerry since 2007.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1960s {{and until}} 2008, the French Pureblood class defined the {{standard}} against which Limousins {{throughout the world}} were measured. Although it would seem appropriate to preserve the French Limousin Herd Book's integrity as the international Limousin breed standard by preventing the EU-mandated entry of animals that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> Full French standard, restrictions to such entries remain forbidden under EU law and subsequent interpretations by the European Court of Justice.|$|E
5|$|Often {{compared}} to San Francisco {{due to the}} hilly terrain and steep maze of residential streets, housing in St. John's is typically painted in bright colours. The city council has implemented strict heritage regulations in the downtown area, including restrictions on the height of buildings. These regulations have caused much controversy over the years. With the city experiencing an economic boom a lack of hotel rooms and office space has seen proposals put forward that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> current height regulations. Heritage advocates argue the current regulations should be enforced while others believe the regulations should be relaxed to encourage economic development.|$|E

5|$|Lem {{was awarded}} an honorary {{membership}} in the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA) in 1973. SFWA Honorary membership is given to people who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> publishing criteria for joining the regular membership, but who would be welcomed as members had their work appeared in the qualifying English-language publications. Lem, however, never had a high opinion of American science fiction, describing it as ill-thought-out, poorly written, and interested more in making money than in ideas or new literary forms. After his eventual American publication, when he became eligible for regular membership, his honorary membership was rescinded, an action {{that some of the}} SFWA members apparently intended as a rebuke, and it seems that Lem interpreted it as such. Lem was invited to stay on with the organization with a regular membership, but declined. After many members (including Ursula K. Le Guin) protested against Lem's treatment by the SFWA, a member offered to pay his dues. Lem never accepted the offer.|$|E
5|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of red-billed tropicbird numbers is difficult {{due to the}} remote locations of nesting sites and vast areas of sea they might be found. This bird {{is considered to be}} a least-concern species according to the IUCN. This is due to the fact that the range, declination, and numbers of this species, although small, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> criteria required to be considered a vulnerable species. The range of this species is believed to be , with an estimated 3,300 to 13,000 mature individuals. In the western Atlantic, a more precise number was given for the population there in 2000; about 4,000 to 5,000 pairs. The population is declining, mainly due to human exploitation of the bird's environment and predation by invasive species, such as rats. These predators have the potential to drive populations of the red-billed tropicbird into serious decline. It is estimated that this bird experienced a population bottleneck about 450 to 750 years ago, likely due to exploitation by humans. This has resulted in low genetic diversity in this tropicbird, which makes the likelihood of it adapting to sudden environmental changes low. In Mexico and Brazil, it is considered to be threatened.|$|E

25|$|Most {{people who}} present {{to mental health}} specialists develop {{agoraphobia}} after the onset of panic disorder. Agoraphobia is best understood as an adverse behavioral outcome of repeated panic attacks and subsequent anxiety and preoccupation with these attacks that leads to an avoidance of situations where a panic attack could occur. Early treatment of panic disorder can often prevent agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is typically determined when symptoms are worse than panic disorder, but also <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> criteria for other anxiety disorders such as depression. In rare cases where agoraphobics <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> criteria used to diagnose panic disorder, the formal diagnosis of agoraphobia without history of panic disorder is used (primary agoraphobia).|$|E
