40|$|PURPOSE: To {{present a}} {{maneuver}} consisting of temporary blockage of the venous {{return to the}} heart for accurate deployment of thoracic aortic <b>endoprostheses.</b> TECHNIQUE: During endovascular repairs in the thoracic aorta, an occluding balloon was introduced through the femoral vein into the right atrium under transesophageal echocardiographic control. The venous return through the inferior vena cava was temporarily blocked to reduce aortic flow during device deployment. The technique was applied in 21 patients with various lesions of the thoracic aorta. Partial inflow occlusion resulted in a mean systolic pressure of 49 +/- 6 mmHg and lasted for 52 +/- 14 seconds. Cardiac function was comparable to the preocclusion state, and no arrhythmias or ischemic events were encountered. In 7 procedures, inotropic or vasoconstrictor support was necessary after deployment. No complications related to the venous system were observed. The <b>endoprostheses</b> were precisely deployed at the target site in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The force of aortic flow often impairs precise deployment of thoracic <b>endoprostheses,</b> resulting in distal displacement.

40|$|Background/Aim. One of the {{possible}} complications after implantation of a cement hip-joint <b>endoprosthesis</b> is fracture in the <b>endoprosthesis</b> body. Fractures arise from overload or material fatigue of which an implant is made. The purpose {{of this research was}} to define the intensity of maximum stress and the positions of a critical cross-section in the <b>endoprosthesis</b> body. Methods. Unilaterally changing forces which act on the hip joint during walking as well as the loads result in flexible deformations of the <b>endoprosthesis</b> body. Biomechanical analysis of the forces acting on the hip joint determine their direction and intensity, whereas on the basis of Gruen’s classification of the <b>endoprosthesis</b> body loosening the level of fixation is established. The bodies of cement hip joint <b>endoprosthesis</b> are made of cobalt-chromiummolybdenum (CoCrMo) alloy, suitable for vacuum casting, are submitted to the analysis. Analysis of the critical stress in the <b>endoprosthesis</b> body was performed on the <b>endoprosthesis</b> body by means of the finite element method. The experimental verification of the obtained results was carried out on the physical prototype under laboratory conditions. Results. Computer analysis, by means of the finite element method, determined the stress state by calculation of the maximum Von Mises stress and critical cross-sections for different angles of the resultant force action. The results obtained by the computer and experimental method correlate and are comparable to the results of similar analyses conducted on various <b>endoprosthesis</b> types. Conclusion. The analyses described in the paper make the basis for improving the process designing of hip joint endoprostheses and their customization to each individual patient (custom made).
