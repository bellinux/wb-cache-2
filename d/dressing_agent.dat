It is found in Asia, Australia, and North America, where it grows on the ground in open woods. Its name, derived from the same Latin root as cranium, alludes to its resemblance to an animal's brain. The skull-shaped fruit body is [...] broad by [...] tall and white to tan. Initially smooth, the skin (peridium) develops wrinkles and folds as it matures, cracking and flaking with age. The peridium eventually sloughs away, exposing a powdery yellow-brown to greenish-yellow spore mass (the gleba). The puffball is edible when the gleba is still white and firm, before it matures to become yellow-brown and powdery. Mature specimens have been used in the traditional or folk medicines of China, Japan, and the Ojibwe as a hemostatic or wound <b>dressing</b> <b>agent.</b> Several bioactive compounds have been isolated and identified from the brain puffball.|$|E

40|$|Background: Preservation of pulp {{vitality}} is {{of utmost}} importance to the normal physiological functioning of tooth in situ and physiological process of exfoliation in a tooth affected by disease or trauma. Pulpotomy serves such a purpose using various medicaments applied directly on vital pulp. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate clinically and radiographically the effects of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and formocresol (FC) as a pulp dressing after coronal pulp amputation (pulpotomy) in primary molars prospectively over a period of 1 year. Materials and Methods: Thirty-three healthy children, aged between 5 and 8 years, requiring pulp therapy were selected after clinical and radiographic assessment. A total of 50 maxillary and mandibular primary molars were treated by the conventional pulpotomy technique. The teeth were divided into two equal groups. In Group A, FC was used as the pulp <b>dressing</b> <b>agent,</b> and in Group B, MTA was used before restoration with stainless steel crowns. The research employed was a prospective study. The teeth treated were assessed postoperatively after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. The observations were tabulated and statistically analyzed. Results: Clinically, both the groups showed 100 % success at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. At 3 months, the radiographic success rates of FC and MTA were 92 % and 96 %, respectively, and at 6 and 12 months, the radiographic success rates of FC and MTA were 88 % and 96 %, respectively. Conclusion: MTA showed a higher success rate than FC and may be a favorable material for pulpotomy in primary molars whose pulps have been compromised by a carious or mechanical pulp exposur...|$|E

40|$|Objective This study {{compared}} the clinical and radiographic effectiveness of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and Portland cement (PC) as pulp <b>dressing</b> <b>agents</b> in carious primary teeth. Methodology Thirty carious primary mandibular molars of children aged 5 - 9 years old {{were randomly assigned}} to MTA or PC groups, and treated by a conventional pulpotomy technique. The teeth were restored with resin modified glass ionomer cement. Clinical and radiographic successes and failures were recorded at 6, 12, 18 and 24 -month follow-up. Results All pulpotomised teeth were clinically and radiographically successful at all follow-up appointments. Six out of 15 teeth in the PC group and five out of 14 teeth in the MTA group exfoliated throughout the follow-up period. No statistically significant difference regarding dentine bridge formation was found between both groups throughout the follow-up period. As far as pulp canal obliteration is concerned, a statistically significant difference was detected at 6 -month follow-up (p < 0. 05), since the beginning of mineralised material deposition could be radiographically detected in 100 % and 57. 14 % of the teeth treated with PC and MTA, respectively.

40|$|Management of burn injury {{has always}} been the domain of burn specialists. Since ancient time, local and {{systemic}} remedies have been advised for burn wound dressing and burn scar prevention. Management of burn wound inflicted by the different physical and chemical agents require different regimes which are poles apart from the regimes used for any of the other traumatic wounds. In extensive burn, because of increased capillary permeability, there is extensive loss of plasma leading to shock while whole blood loss is the cause of shock in other acute wounds. Even though the burn wounds are sterile in the beginning in comparison to most of other wounds, yet, the death in extensive burns is mainly because of wound infection and septicemia, because of the immunocompromised status of the burn patients. Eschar and blister are specific for burn wounds requiring a specific treatment protocol. Antimicrobial creams and other <b>dressing</b> <b>agents</b> used for traumatic wounds are ineffective in deep burns with eschar. The subeschar plane harbours the micro-organisms and many of these agents are not able to penetrate the eschar. Even after complete epithelisation of burn wound, remodelling phase is prolonged. It may take years for scar maturation in burns. This article emphasizes on how the pathophysiology, healing and management of a burn wound is different from that of other wounds...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), calcium hydroxide (CH) and formocresol (FC) as pulp <b>dressing</b> <b>agents</b> in carious primary teeth. Methodology Forty-five primary mandibular molars with dental caries in 23 children [AUTHOR QUERY: How many children?] between 5 and 9 years old were treated by a conventional pulpotomy technique. The teeth {{were randomly assigned to}} the experimental (CH or MTA) or control (FC) groups. After coronal pulp removal and haemostasis, remaining pulp tissue was covered with MTA paste or CH powder in the experimental groups. In the control group, diluted FC was placed with a cotton pellet over the pulp tissue for 5 min and removed; the pulp tissue was then covered with zinc oxide-eugenol (ZOE) paste. All teeth were restored with reinforced ZOE base and resin modified glass-ionomer cement. Clinical and radiographic successes and failures were recorded at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 month follow-up. Results Forty-three teeth were available for follow-up. In the FC and MTA groups, 100 % of the available teeth were clinically and radiographically successful at all follow-up appointments; dentine bridge formation could be detected in 29 % of the teeth treated with MTA. In the CH group, 64 % of the teeth presented clinical and radiographic failures detected throughout the follow-up period, and internal resorption was a frequent radiographic finding. Conclusions Mineral trioxide aggregate was superior to CH and equally as effective as FC as a pulpotomy dressing in primary mandibular molars. Internal resorption was the most common radiographic finding up to 24 month after pulpotomies performed with CH...|$|R

40|$|External wounds such as cuts, abrasions, {{lacerations}} and {{in cases}} deep wounds like gunshot wound or even burns {{are included in}} common causes of death as they lead to heavy blood loss from human body. Prevention for these issues are use of hemostatic agent in the preliminary stage thereby impeding blood loss for 30 minutes to 1 hour at least and alleviate hypovolemic shock induced deaths in humans. Numerous wound dressing materials have been developed in last few decades which use simple, readily available biomaterials to prepare hemostatic agents either {{in the form of}} powder, or gauge or sponge material or beads etc. Almost all commercially available agents are found to have excellent desired characteristics as a wound dressing even though almost each of them lack some major characteristics. For a dressing to be ideal it should be highly hemocompatible, it should have antimicrobial properties, it should be hydrophilic, should have moisture content, should be able to remove easily, should be flexible to use in all types of wounds, not just superficial, flat wounds and lastly it should absorb all the exudates. Some of the commercially available wound <b>dressing</b> <b>agents</b> are QuickClot, Hemcon Chitogauge, Cel-X etc. QuickClot (Z-Medica) is composed of mineral zeolite powder with a 3 D honeycomb structure that allows it to sift molecules by size. When comes in contact with blood, it absorbs water molecules increasing the clotting factors and cell concentrations at the wound. This readily forms clot at the wounded site. However QuickClot was found to have a severe side effect. It appeared to be exothermic and caused local tissue burn at the wounded site. Also use of granular form QuickClot was difficult. Once clot is formed, the powder could only be extracted by surgery. Hemcon, made up of chitosan is a stiff dressing and thus is limited only to superficial wounds. For deep wounds more advanced ChitoFlex and ChitoGauge are used. ...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of dressings and topical agents on surgical wounds healing by secondary intention SEARCH STRATEGY: We sought relevant trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases in March 2002. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of dressings and topical agents for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Eligibility for inclusion was confirmed by two reviewers who independently judged the methodological quality of the trials according to the Dutch Cochrane Centre list of factors relating to internal and external validity. Two reviewers summarised data from eligible studies using a data extraction sheet, any disagreements were referred to a third reviewer. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen reports of 13 RCTs on dressings or topical agents for postoperative wounds healing by secondary intention were identified. WOUND HEALING: Whilst a single small trial of aloe vera supplementation vs gauze suggests delayed healing with aloe vera, {{the results of this}} trial are un interpretable since there was a large differential loss to follow up. A plaster cast applied to an amputation stump accelerated wound healing compared with elastic compression, WMD - 25. 60 days, 95 % CI - 49. 08 to - 2. 12 days (1 trial). There were no statistically significant differences in healing for other dressing comparisons (e. g. gauze, foam, alginate; 11 trials). PAIN: Gauze was associated with significantly more pain for patients than other dressings (4 trials). PATIENT SATISFACTION: Patients treated with gauze were less satisfied compared with those receiving alternative dressings (3 trials). COSTS: Gauze is inexpensive but its use is {{associated with the use of}} significantly more nursing time than foam (2 trials). LENGTH OF HOSPITAL STAY: Four trials showed no difference in length of hospital stay. One trial found shorter hospital stay in people after amputation when plaster casts were applied compared with elastic compression (WMD - 30. 10 days; 95 % CI - 49. 82 to - 10. 38). REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: We found only small, poor quality trials; the evidence is therefore insufficient to determine whether the choice of <b>dressing</b> or topical <b>agent</b> affects the healing of surgical wounds healing by secondary intention. Foam is best studied as an alternative for gauze and appears to be preferable as to pain reduction, patient satisfaction and nursing tim...|$|R
