Pat Nixon later stated that her rapt <b>gaze</b> <b>was</b> {{because she did}} not know exactly what he would say, and wanted to hear. Nixon detailed their assets and liabilities: the mortgaged home in Washington; the similarly mortgaged home in California, then occupied by his parents. The loans from his parents and from Riggs Bank. The borrowed-against life insurance policy on the senator; no insurance on his wife or children. The two-year-old Oldsmobile and the family furniture, and {{that he and his wife}} owned no stocks or bonds.|$|E
5|$|In June 1832 Yagan led a {{party of}} Aborigines in attacking two labourers sowing a field of wheat {{alongside}} the Canning River near Kelmscott. One of the men, John Thomas, escaped, but the other, William <b>Gaze,</b> <b>was</b> wounded and later died as a result. The settlement declared Yagan an outlaw and offered a reward of £20 for his capture. He avoided capture until early October 1832. A group of fishermen enticed Yagan and two companions into their boat, then pushed off into deep water. The fishermen took the three Noongar men to the Perth guardhouse, from which they were transferred to the Round House at Fremantle. Yagan was sentenced to death, but he was saved by the intercession of settler Robert Lyon. Arguing that Yagan was defending his land against invasion, Lyon said Yagan {{should not be considered}} a criminal but a prisoner of war and suggested he should be treated as such. At the recommendation of John Septimus Roe, the Surveyor-General of Western Australia, Yagan and his men were exiled on Carnac Island under the supervision of Lyon and two soldiers.|$|E
500|$|Although the Ross Sea party's main {{role was}} to lay supply depots, Shackleton [...] added a small {{scientific}} team to carry out biological, meteorological and magnetic research in the region. [...] The chief scientist in this group was Alexander Stevens, a Scots geologist and former theology student. John Cope, a 21-year-old Cambridge graduate, was the team's biologist; a would-be medical student, he later became ship's surgeon.

500|$|St. John and {{the writers}} {{received}} {{praise for the}} recast, and for successfully re-integrating Todd into the show's canvas. Soap Opera Weekly stated, [...] "They said it couldn't be done. One Life to Live's Todd (previously played by Roger Howarth) could not be recast. But with an appealing actor and the right pacing, One Life to Live may just have done it". The magazine stated that the writers revealed Todd's identity slowly, letting Walker develop as a character before dropping hints {{that he might be}} Todd. [...] By the time he disclosed who he really was to his daughter Starr, the audience had already suspected the truth. Soap Opera Weekly called the reveal scene between St. John and Alderson, who played Starr, [...] "one of those great (and, these days, rare) must-see moments". [...] Soap Opera Digest said that despite the recast, a difficult situation in and of itself, [...] "St. John aptly distinguished between Walker, who's really Todd, as well as Flynn, who pretended to be Walker". The magazine stated that St. John revealed glimmers of Todd to the audience: [...] "We could see Todd when Walker lowered his eyes while holding back from telling his sister, Viki; with fiancee Blair, Walker's <b>gaze</b> <b>was</b> always shifting, making sure nothing could clue her in to his secret". The article also credited St. John with maintaining [...] "the [...] relationship of Todd and Starr" [...] and for keeping their scenes touching and delightful.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{example of}} the Zapatistas' {{effective}} use of the postcolonial <b>gaze</b> <b>was</b> their use of organizations like the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) to raise of awareness for their rebellion and indigenous rights, what critics described as the Mexican government's {{lack of respect for}} the country's impoverished and marginalized populations. [...] Appealing to the ECOSOC and other traditionally Western-influenced non-governmental bodies allowed the Zapatistas, it is argued, to establish a sense of autonomy by using the postcolonial gaze to redefine their identities both as indigenous people and as citizens of Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|Another odd {{feature of}} the Selectric {{terminals}} was the [...] "keyboard lock" [...] mechanism. [...] If the computer system a user was communicating with {{was too busy to}} accept input, it could send a code to mechanically interlock the keyboard so the user could not press any keys. The keyboard was also locked when the computer was typing, to avoid damaging the mechanism or interleaving user input and computer output in a confusing manner. [...] Though done to protect the print mechanism from damage, an unexpected keyboard lock activation could cause minor injury to a typist with a heavy touch. [...] There was little obvious warning that the keyboard had locked or unlocked, other than a faint click from the interlock solenoid, easily drowned out by the printer and fan noise in many computer facilities. [...] There was a small indicator light, but this was of little help to fast touch typists whose <b>gaze</b> <b>was</b> fixed on copy they were transcribing.|$|E
50|$|Cyclodisparity due {{to images}} having been rotated inward can be {{compensated}} better when the <b>gaze</b> <b>is</b> directed downwards, and cyclodisparity {{due to an}} outward rotation can be compensated better when the <b>gaze</b> <b>is</b> directed upwards. A proposed explanation for this phenomenon is that the motor system is coordinated {{in such a way}} that the eyes perform a torsional movement to reduce the size of the search zones and thus the computational load required for solving the correspondence problem. The resulting cyclovergence at near <b>gaze</b> <b>is</b> smaller than the cyclovergence predicted by Listing's law.|$|R

40|$|Educating the <b>gaze</b> <b>is</b> easily {{understood}} as becoming conscious {{about what is}} ‘really’ {{happening in the world}} and becoming aware of the way our <b>gaze</b> <b>is</b> itself bound to a perspective and particular position. However, the paper explores a different idea. It understands educating the gaze not in the sense of ‘educare’ (teaching) but of ‘e-ducere’ as leading out, reaching out. E-ducating the <b>gaze</b> <b>is</b> not about getting at a liberated or critical view, but about liberating or displacing our view. It is not about becoming conscious or aware, but about becoming attentive, about paying attention. E-ducating the <b>gaze,</b> then, <b>is</b> not depending on method, but relying on discipline; it does not require a rich methodology, but asks for a poor pedagogy, i. e. for practices which allow to expose ourselves. One example of such practice is that of walking. Consequently e-ducating the <b>gaze</b> could <b>be</b> about an invitation to go walking. This idea is explored b way of a comment on two quotations, one by Walter Benjamin and one by Michel Foucault. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Alexanders law {{refers to}} {{spontaneous}} nystagmus that occurs after an acute unilateral vestibular loss. It was first described in 1912 and has three elements {{to explain how}} the vestibulo-ocular reflex responds to an acute vestibular insult. The first element says that spontaneous nystagmus after an acute vestibular impairment has the fast phase directed toward the healthy ear. The direction of the nystagmus, by convention, is named for the fast phase, so the spontaneous nystagmus is directed toward the healthy ear. The second element says nystagmus <b>is</b> greatest when <b>gaze</b> <b>is</b> directed toward the healthy ear, is attentuated at central <b>gaze</b> and may <b>be</b> absent when <b>gaze</b> <b>is</b> directed toward the impaired ear. The third element says that spontaneous nystagmus with central <b>gaze</b> <b>is</b> augmented when vision is denied. This became apparent with the implementation of electrographic testing.|$|R

40|$|Godfrey Reggio’s film Visitors (2013) is {{composed}} primarily of gazes. It {{begins with a}} gorilla’s direct gaze as it emerges from darkness, and this initial <b>gaze</b> <b>is</b> quickly followed {{by a series of}} human gazes. The gorilla’s gaze haunts the film, however, as it reappears {{in the middle of the}} film and also concludes it. These <b>gazes</b> <b>are</b> affective; the viewer spends almost the entire duration of the film being stared at, and thus quickly becomes sensitized to these gazes and their idiosyncrasies, as well as their effects. This paper examines these gazes and how they are experienced in the film. Focusing primarily on the gorilla’s gazes, I review theories surrounding the human gaze in regards to affect and power, and compare these theories to how the animal <b>gaze</b> has <b>been</b> examined, including concepts such as gaze sensitivity and its socioecological context and the effects of mirror neurons, arguing that this simian gaze acts as a bridge that combines, yet challenges, both. I ask: how does the gorilla’s gazes problematize how the human <b>gaze</b> has <b>been</b> theorized and its effects? How can theories of the animal <b>gaze</b> <b>be</b> incorporated in existing anthropocentric theories on the gaze...|$|R
