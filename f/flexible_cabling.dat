All <b>flexible</b> <b>cable</b> conductor surfaces, {{including those with}} rough morphology and foreign inclusions, achieved surface resistivity of ∼ 10 – 20 [*][*]MΩ/sq. at room temperature and kept charge dissipation in a wide +/- 150 [*]°C space-related temperature range.

Through ultra-clean and high purity technology or adding nanometer materials into the cross-linked AC cable insulation, the space charge problem of cross-linked DC cable has been solved. Due to the high softening point, the cable has small thermal deformation, high mechanical strength in high temperature and good thermal aging resistance of cross-linked polyethylene, thus its highest operating temperature can reach up to 90  °C, and its short-time allowable temperature can reach up to 250  °C. The XLPE insulated HVDC <b>Flexible</b> <b>cable</b> is extruded into new-style monopole cable by three lays of polymeric materials. The insulating layer is extruded simultaneously by the conductor shielding layer, the insulating layer and the insulation shielding layer.

40|$|Vortex-induced {{vibrations}} (VIV) of <b>flexible</b> <b>cables</b> are {{an example}} of flow-induced vibrations that can act as energy harvesting systems by converting energy associated with the spontaneous cable motion into electricity. This work investigates the optimal positioning of the harvesting devices along the cable, using numerical simulations with a wake oscillator model to describe the unsteady flow forcing. Using classical gradient-based optimization, the optimal harvesting strategy is determined for the generic configuration of a <b>flexible</b> <b>cable</b> fixed at both ends, including the effect of flow forces and gravity on the cable's geometry. The optimal strategy is found to consist systematically in a concentration of the harvesting devices {{at one of the}} cable's ends, relying on deformation waves along the cable to carry the energy toward this harvesting site. Furthermore, we show that the performance of systems based on VIV of <b>flexible</b> <b>cables</b> is significantly more robust to flow velocity variations, in comparison with a rigid cylinder device. This results from two passive control mechanisms inherent to the cable geometry : (i) the adaptability to the flow velocity of the fundamental frequencies of cables through the flow-induced tension and (ii) the selection of successive vibration modes by the flow velocity for cables with gravity-induced tension.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} method for {{efficient}} power control of Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) based on the estimation of the instantaneous value of the <b>flexible</b> <b>cable</b> inductance. In this method, the displacements of the graphite electrodes regulating arc voltages are controlled using instant values of inductances at the secondary side of the EAF in three phases. For on-line estimation of inductance values, an artificial neural network is trained, using a random set of data obtained from an appropriate inductance simulator. The performance of the proposed method is examined by comparing the thermal energy efficiency of a typical EAF for two control schemes, namely, constant and varying <b>flexible</b> <b>cable</b> inductances.
