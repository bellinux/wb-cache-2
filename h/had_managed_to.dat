5|$|After {{the fall}} of Diệm and the {{execution}} of Cẩn in May 1964, the VNQDD became more active in their strongholds in central Vietnam. Nevertheless, there was no coherent national leadership and groups at district and provincial level tended to operate autonomously. By 1965, their members <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> infiltrate and take over the Peoples Action Teams (PATs), irregular paramilitary counter-insurgency forces organised by Australian Army advisers to fight the communists, and used them for their own purposes. In December, one VNQDD member <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> turn his PAT colleagues towards the nationalist agenda, and the local party leadership in Quảng Nam approached the Australians {{in an attempt to}} have the 1000-man PAT outfit formally allied to the VNQDD. The overture was rejected. The politicisation of paramilitary units worked both ways; some province chiefs used the anti-communist forces to assassinate political opponents, including VNQDD members.|$|E

King George V <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} the Georgian realm {{to all of}} Transcaucasia. However, after 1346 the Kingdom began to decline, caused by George's death and the devastating spread of the plague throughout the area soon afterwards.|$|E

By August 2011, the new administration and its AMISOM allies <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> capture all of Mogadishu from the Al-Shabaab militants. Mogadishu has subsequently experienced a period of intense reconstruction spearheaded by the Somali diaspora, the municipal authorities, and Turkey, a historic ally of Somalia.|$|E

5|$|On 12 September various {{opinion polls}} showed that Folkvords {{popularity}} had increased again in Oslo which {{gave rise to}} speculation that Folkvord would win Inger Lise Husøy's seat in parliament because of this sudden rise in popularity.

5|$|A major {{complication}} in remastering {{the original}} work was having {{many of the}} critical game files go missing or on archaic formats. A large number of backup files were made on Digital Linear Tape (DLT) which Disney/LucasArts {{had been able to}} recover for Double Fine, but the company had no drives to read the tapes. Former LucasArts sound engineer Jory Prum <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> save a DLT drive and was able to extract all of the game's audio development data from the tapes.|$|E
5|$|After this, {{the units}} of I Anzac Corps {{returned}} to the Somme, to relieve units of the Fourth Army, which <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> push their lines to a position just below the Bapaume heights throughout September. The 2nd Battalion {{was not involved in}} any major actions during this time, although elements from the 1st Brigade—specifically the 1st Battalion with support from the 3rd—put in an attack on a salient that had developed in the front line north of Gueudecourt, which failed amid exceptionally muddy conditions.|$|E

5|$|Alexios {{advanced}} from Salonica {{and pitched}} {{camp on the}} river Charzanes near Dyrrhachium on October 15. He held a war council there and sought advice from his senior officers; among them was George Palaiologos, who <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> sneak out of the city. A majority of the senior officers, including Palaiologos, urged caution, noting that time was with the Emperor. Alexios, however, favoured an immediate assault, hoping to catch Guiscard's army from the rear, {{while they were still}} besieging the city. Alexios moved his army to the hills opposite the city, planning to attack the Normans the next day.|$|E
5|$|Although Mazariegos <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> {{establish}} his new provincial capital without armed conflict, excessive Spanish demands for labour and supplies soon provoked the locals into rebellion. In August 1528, Mazariegos replaced the existing encomenderos {{with his friends}} and allies; the natives, seeing the Spanish isolated and witnessing the hostility between the original and newly arrived settlers, took this opportunity to rebel and refused to supply their new masters. Zinacantán was the only indigenous settlement that remained loyal to the Spanish.|$|E

Neither ship had sustained any significant damage. In the opinion of Virginias commander Jones and her other officers, Monitor could have sunk their ship had she hit the vessel at the waterline.|$|E

5|$|As underdogs on {{the road}} against the Charlotte 49ers, the Dukes' new 10–40strategy led them to an 83–77upset victory. This {{was the first time}} of the season the team <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> win two {{consecutive}} conference games. On February 21, Duquesne again returned home for a nationally-televised game against the Dayton Flyers. Senior Jason Duty was honored in a pre-game ceremony, and the game's attendance of 5,144was only 214short of the A.J. Palumbo Center's capacity.

5|$|Despite some {{immediate}} confiscations {{after the}} siege, {{by the time}} of the Restoration of Charles II, the Somerset family <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> recover most of their possessions, including Raglan Castle. Henry Somerset, the 3rd Marquess, decided to prioritise the rebuilding of his other houses at Troy and Badminton, rather than Raglan, reusing some of the property sent away for safety before the war, or salvaged after the slighting.|$|E
5|$|Following this defeat, the Islamic Courts Union {{splintered}} {{into several}} different factions. Some {{of the more}} radical elements, including Al-Shabaab, regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government's troops.|$|E

5|$|In 1756, after over-running Saxony, Frederick campaigned in Bohemia; he {{defeated}} the Austrians on 6 May 1757 at the Battle of Prague. Learning that French forces had invaded his ally's territory of Hanover, Frederick moved west. On 5 November 1757, an infantry regiment of about 1,000 men and 1,500 of his cavalry destroyed the combined French and Austrian force of 30,000 at the Battle of Rossbach in a 90-minute battle. In his absence, though, the Austrians <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> retake Silesia: the Empresses' brother-in-law, Prince Charles, took {{the city of}} Schweidnitz and had moved on Breslau in lower Silesia.|$|E
