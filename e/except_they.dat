5|$|There are two {{varieties}} of the two-colored bolete: borealis and subreticulatus. Both varieties {{have a very}} similar habitat {{to that of the}} main species, <b>except</b> <b>they</b> appear to be limited to just the North American continent. Both varieties also have a slightly different coloration than that of the two-colored bolete, have deeper pores, and are not as often eaten or used in regional recipes.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the Punic wars of the 2nd century BC, this form of {{organisation}} was found to be inefficient. In a new Polybian system, infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth, the principes being older veterans with a greater degree of experience. Their equipment and role was very similar to the previous system, <b>except</b> <b>they</b> now carried swords, or gladii, instead of spears. Each princeps also carried two pila, heavy javelins that bent on impact to prevent them being removed from the victim or thrown back.|$|E

5|$|Player created digital walkthroughs are {{typically}} designed to assist other players in accomplishing certain feats within {{video games and}} are similar to text-based or telephony-based walkthroughs, <b>except</b> <b>they</b> can also be solely for entertainment purposes. These digital walkthroughs {{are typically}} uploaded to video sharing websites such as YouTube or live-streamed playthroughs to media streaming sites such as Twitch.tv. Let's Play videos are a special type of walkthrough generally more focused on entertaining rather than informing the viewer through humorous commentary given by the video's host as they complete the game.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{both sexes}} in both species are almost identical, with the only {{difference}} being iris colour in the lesser melampitta, the male having a red iris and the female a brown one. The plumage of juvenile lesser melampittas {{is the same as}} adults <b>except</b> <b>they</b> are brown on the lower body. Several researchers have noted that the plumage of juvenile greater melampittas resembles that of the hooded pitohui. Hooded pitohuis are unusual for birds in having a toxin, homobatrachotoxin, in their feathers and skin which can cause convulsions and death if consumed. The resemblance is probably an example of Batesian mimicry as the greater melampitta is not itself poisonous.|$|E
5|$|The story {{opens on}} Sunday May 13, 2007, {{and the next}} day at school, Kyousuke decides that the Little Busters are going to play a {{baseball}} game, <b>except</b> <b>they</b> do not have enough members to have a complete team. Kyousuke gives Riki and Rin the task of going around school to find more members to join, preferably girls so as not to leave Rin the lone girl. Riki finds five girls his age willing to help him out: Komari Kamikita, Haruka Saigusa, Kudryavka Noumi, Yuiko Kurugaya, and Mio Nishizono; three other girls Riki meets are Kanata Futaki, Sasami Sasasegawa, and Saya Tokido. Throughout the game, Riki hangs out with these girls and learns more about them.|$|E

5|$|About 30% of {{undergraduate}} men and about 40% {{of undergraduate}} women at Duke {{are members of}} fraternities and sororities. Most of the 17 Interfraternity Council recognized fraternity chapters live in sections within the residence halls. Starting in 2012, the nine Panhellenic Association sorority chapters decided to live in houses (clusters of apartments) on Central Campus. Not all sorority members live with their chapters, though, as membership exceeds house space. Eight National Pan-Hellenic Council (historically African American) fraternities and sororities also hold chapters at Duke. In addition, there are seven other fraternities and sororities that {{are a part of}} the Inter-Greek Council, the multicultural Greek umbrella organization. Duke also has Selective Living Groups, or SLGs, on campus for students seeking informal residential communities often built around themes. SLGs are residential groups similar to fraternities or sororities, <b>except</b> <b>they</b> are generally co-ed and unaffiliated with any national organizations. Fraternity chapters and SLGs frequently host social events in their residential sections, which are often open to non-members.|$|E

50|$|Their {{morphology}} {{is believed}} to facilitate moisture absorption and accumulation, via the open body sutures and the loosely joined body parts. Subtribe Trachynotina <b>excepting,</b> <b>they</b> show an almost uniform tendency to be nocturnal, crepuscular or shade-loving. Like the tribe Tentyriini, their daily rhythm {{is based on a}} strictly nocturnal ancestral disposition. Their open and non-connate body sutures suggest the enjoyment of nocturnal conditions and night moisture.|$|R
25|$|In {{the name}} of Islam, the Uyghur leader Abdullah Bughra violently {{physically}} assaulted the Yarkand-based Swedish missionaries and would have executed them, <b>except</b> <b>they</b> were only banished due to the British Aqsaqal's intercession in their favor.|$|E

25|$|Technically, {{the county}} {{government}} was abolished in 1997, and former county agencies, institutions, etc., reverted {{to the control}} of the state government of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. However, certain county government positions, such as District Attorney and Sheriff, do still function, <b>except</b> <b>they</b> are under the state government instead of a county government.|$|E

25|$|Largely {{recruited}} from the Odrysian tribe, the Thracian cavalry also acted as scouts on the march. In battle, they performed much the same function as the Prodromoi and Paeonians, <b>except</b> <b>they</b> guarded the flank of the Thessalian cavalry on the left wing of the army. The Thracians deployed in their ancestral wedge formations and were armed with javelins and swords. At Gaugamela, the Thracians fielded four ilai and were about 500 strong.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the easiest}} face vise to install is the {{self-contained}} iron vise, {{sometimes called the}} 'quick-action' vise (<b>except</b> <b>they</b> are not all quick-action). This tool comes already assembled and only has to be mounted to the bench. Usually, auxiliary wooden jaws are added. The quick-action feature makes setting it much quicker and is quickly taken for granted. Not only are these vises easy to install and use, they are also robust. Their main drawback is the relatively high cost.|$|E
25|$|During the Lesser Lenten seasons (Nativity Fast, Apostles' Fast and Dormition Fast) the Little Hours undergo changes {{similar to}} those during Great Lent, except the Lenten hymns are usually read instead of chanted, {{and there are no}} kathismata. In addition, on weekdays of the Lesser Fasts, an Inter-Hour (Greek: Mesorion) may be read {{immediately}} after each Hour (at least {{on the first day of}} the Fast). The Inter-Hours follow the same general outline as the Little Hours, <b>except</b> <b>they</b> are shorter.|$|E
