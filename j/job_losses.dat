5|$|As a major {{industrial}} city into the mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social tensions of larger cities that accompanied rapid growth and many new immigrants and migrants. By the 1950s, Omaha was {{a center for}} illegal gambling, while experiencing dramatic <b>job</b> <b>losses</b> and unemployment because of dramatic restructuring of the railroads and the meatpacking industry, {{as well as other}} sectors. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and <b>job</b> <b>losses</b> generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.|$|E
5|$|The current {{economic}} climate {{in the country}} has affected many Icelandic businesses and citizens. With the creation of Nýi Landsbanki, the new organisation which replaces the old Landsbanki, around 300 employees will lose their jobs due to a radical restructuring of the organisation which is intended to minimise the bank's international operations. Similar <b>job</b> <b>losses</b> are expected at Glitnir and Kaupthing The <b>job</b> <b>losses</b> can {{be compared with the}} 2,136 registered unemployed and 495 advertised vacancies in Iceland at the end of August 2008.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s <b>job</b> <b>losses</b> due to {{industrial}} restructuring caused New York City, including Manhattan, {{to suffer from}} economic problems and rising crime rates.

30|$|Finally, we also {{investigated}} the longer run implications of <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> {{for mental health}} by re-estimating our main specifications including a measure of <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> lagged one period. 9 In almost all cases, the substantive effect of recent <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> remains virtually unchanged {{and there is no}} evidence of long-term mental health effects of spousal and parental <b>job</b> <b>loss.</b> The exception is that the negative impact of husbands’ recent <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> with women’s mental health is statistically significant and somewhat larger in absolute magnitude, while lagged <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> is also associated with a significant reduction in women’s mental health.|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the effect of international outsourcing on <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> fears. We combine industry-level outsourcing measures with micro-level data from a large German household panel survey and estimate ordinal fixed-effects models to account for individual unobserved heterogeneity and the ordinal nature of reported <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> fears. Aggregate out-sourcing is not found to substantially or significantly affect <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> fears, but outsourcing to low-wage countries does significantly raise <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> fears whilst outsourcing to high-wage countries significantly lowers <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> fears...|$|R
30|$|To further test our {{identification}} assumption, {{we follow}} Marcus (2013) in repeating our analysis using placebo regressions {{in which we}} pretend that any observed involuntary <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> takes place either (i) 1  year or (ii) 2  years earlier than it in fact did. This effectively involves replacing the measure of recent <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> {{with a measure of}} <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> in the year ahead (and separately, 2  years ahead) allowing us to investigate any trends in mental health before <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> occurs. As expected, we find that the significant mental health penalties associated with <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> discussed above disappear when we use the placebo <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> measure. Thus, our results are driven by the actual timing of <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> rather than any prior downward trajectory in the mental health of family members.|$|R

5|$|After a brief {{slowdown}} of {{the economy}} {{at the end of}} the Depression, the country entered World War II, which renewed the importance of railroads. The rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles, so Meridian became the region's rail center again. This renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s, when the affordability of automobiles and the subsidized Interstate Highway System drew off passengers from the trains. The decline of the railroad industry, which went through considerable restructuring among freight lines as well, caused significant <b>job</b> <b>losses.</b> The city's population declined as workers left for other areas.|$|E

30|$|We {{find that}} the effects of {{unexpected}} involuntary <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> largely mirror those of involuntary <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> overall. Specifically, we find no evidence that a husband’s mental health is adversely affected by his wife’s unexpected <b>job</b> <b>loss.</b> This is true irrespective {{of whether or not the}} wife remains not employed or the couples’ degree of relationship dissatisfaction. 8 Similarly, husbands’ unexpected involuntary <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> has no significant effect on their wives’ reported mental health overall. As before, wives do have significantly poorer mental health if their husbands lose their jobs and remain out of work rather than finding new employment. Importantly, this differential is substantially larger when the <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> was unexpected. The disparity in wives’ mental health outcomes associated with experiencing financial stress and relationship dissatisfaction in combination with their husbands’ unexpected involuntary <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> is similar in magnitude to that associated with involuntary <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> overall but becomes statistically insignificant. Finally, and consistent with our previous results, we find little evidence that adolescents’ mental health is negatively affected by their parents’ involuntary <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> even when it is unexpected.|$|R
5|$|In 1989, Blyth A won a {{place in}} the Guinness Book of Records by setting the world record for total running hours in a plant of its size, when all four {{generating}} units achieved 200,000running hours. With the privatisation of the UK's electricity supply industry in 1990, the station passed into the ownership of National Power. In 1991, the two 275MW units at Blyth B (units 5 & 6) were decommissioned on the grounds of economy, despite the station having been modernised in the early 1980s. This decommissioning resulted in 260 <b>job</b> <b>losses.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 1960 the Royal Navy ceased {{operating}} the Sheerness dockyard and the Medway Port Authority {{took over the}} site for commercial use. The dockyard closure led to thousands of <b>job</b> <b>losses,</b> {{and most of the}} nearby houses and shops in the Bluetown area were eventually abandoned and demolished. By the 1961 census, the population of Sheerness had fallen to 13,691. The dockyard closure also led to the decline of the Sheerness and District Cooperative Society, as many of its members were dockyard workers. At the time, the society was the island's main retailer, but it has since been reduced to a few shops and been merged with a larger society.|$|E
5|$|For decades Salford's {{economy was}} heavily {{dependent}} on manufacturing industry, especially textiles and engineering. Since the Second World War however, Salford has experienced decades of growing unemployment as these sectors diminished and new sectors chose to locate in out of town locations with better transport links. Between 1965 and 1991 the city lost over 49,000jobs, or more than 32% of its employment base. Several factors contributed to this decline, not least changes in the national and international economies, {{the introduction of new}} technology and the concentration of investment in London and South East England. The biggest <b>job</b> <b>losses</b> were experienced in Salford's traditional industries and although the service sector expanded during this period, it was unable to compensate for the decline in manufacturing.|$|E
40|$|Although the {{importance}} of expectations is well documented in the decision-making literature, a key shortcoming of the empirical research into effects of involuntary <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> on depression is perhaps its neglect of the subjective expectations of <b>job</b> <b>loss.</b> Using data from the US Health and Retirement Study surveys we examine whether the impact of <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> on mental health is influenced by an individual's subjective expectations regarding future displacement. Our results imply that, among older workers in the age range of 55 - 65 year, subjective expectations are as significant predictors of depression as <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> itself, and ignoring them can bias the estimate {{of the impact of}} <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> on mental health. <b>Job</b> <b>loss</b> Mental health Subjective expectations Panel data USA...|$|R

This provides a more comprehensive picture of the effect of <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> in the UK than previously available. <b>Job</b> <b>loss</b> causes a long-run reduction in income which is mainly due to reductions in monthly pay rather than in employment propensity.

5|$|Peel {{worked with}} one of his weavers, James Hargreaves, to {{investigate}} new technologies. In 1762, Peel and Hargreaves set up a carding machine, but decided against using it. When Hargreaves went on to invent the spinning jenny in 1764, Peel was keen to use the technology. He set them up in his factory at Stanhill where Hargreaves worked. In the spring of 1768, the spinning jennies at Peel's factory were blamed for <b>job</b> <b>losses.</b> The factories and Hargreaves' nearby house were the targets of a riot, destroying the spinning jennies within– along with some of Peel's own inventions. In reaction, Peel moved his manufacturing away from Lancashire. He decided on Burton-upon-Trent where he built three mills, including cutting a canal for one.|$|E

5|$|The {{public sector}} {{is a major}} {{employer}} in Northern England.

All three Northern regions have public sector employment above the national average, and North East has the highest level in England with 20.2% of the workforce in the public sector as of 2016 – down from 23.4% a decade earlier. The austerity programme under the government of David Cameron saw significant cuts to public services, and the reduction in public sector employment resulted in <b>job</b> <b>losses</b> for around 3% of the Northern England workforce with significant impact on the regional economy.|$|E
30|$|First, {{and perhaps}} most critically, we have assumed that our measure of {{involuntary}} <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> is exogenous. That is, our maintained assumption is that our control variables effectively capture all of the time-varying factors simultaneously affecting individuals’ prior <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> and their family members’ current mental health. Others (notably Marcus 2013) argue that this assumption is more plausible if <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> {{is the result of}} a business closure. The HILDA Survey data, however, do not enable <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> due to business closures to be separately identified. Fortunately, employees are asked about the expected probability of losing their job through being retrenched, being fired, or not having their contract renewed during the year ahead. This allows us to identify workers for whom <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> was largely unanticipated, increasing the chances that the <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> workers experience is exogenous. We thus replicated our analysis using an alternative <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> indicator which equals one only for individuals who reported involuntarily losing their job since the previous survey and who also reported, at the previous interview, that there was a 0 % chance of <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> in the year ahead.|$|R
30|$|Our paper {{makes an}} {{important}} contribution in quantifying these effects by analysing the impact of involuntary <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> on {{the mental health of}} family members. We find no evidence that husbands’ mental health is affected by their wives’ <b>job</b> <b>loss.</b> Wives’ mental health deteriorates, however, following their husbands’ <b>job</b> <b>loss,</b> but the magnitude of this decline is only statistically significant if their husbands experience a sustained period of non-employment or if the couple experienced financial hardship or relationship strain prior to the husband losing his job. We also find that co-resident adolescent children’s mental health is unaffected by their fathers’ <b>job</b> <b>loss.</b> Adolescents’ mental health declines, however, after their mothers’ <b>job</b> <b>loss,</b> but only if they experience a period of sustained non-employment. Finally, it is adolescent girls rather than boys who are sensitive to their mothers’ <b>job</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Qualitative {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} {{the possibility of}} <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> following occupational injuries for some workers, but prospective investigations are scant. We used a sample of nursing home workers from the Work, Family and Health Network to prospectively investigate association between occupational injuries and <b>job</b> <b>loss.</b> Methods: We merged data on 1331 workers assessed 4 times over an 18 -month period with administrative data that include <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> from employers and publicly available data on their workplaces. Workers self-reported occupational injuries in surveys. Multivariable logistic regression models estimated risk ratios {{for the impact of}} occupational injuries on overall <b>job</b> <b>loss,</b> whereas multinomial models were used to estimate OR of voluntary and involuntary <b>job</b> <b>loss.</b> Use of marginal structural models allowed for adjustments of multilevel lists of confounders that may be time varying and/or on the causal pathway. Results: By 12 months, 30. 3 % of workers experienced occupational injury, whereas 24. 2 % experienced <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> by 18 months. Comparing workers who reported occupational injuries to those reporting no injuries, risk ratio of overall <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> within the subsequent 6 months was 1. 31 (95 % CI 0. 93 to 1. 86). Comparing the same groups, injured workers had higher odds of experiencing involuntary <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> (OR 2. 19; 95 % CI 1. 27 to 3. 77). Also, compared with uninjured workers, those injured more than once had higher odds of voluntary <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> (OR 1. 95; 95 % CI 1. 03 to 3. 67), while those injured once had higher odds of involuntary <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> (OR 2. 19; 95 % CI 1. 18 to 4. 05). Conclusions: Despite regulatory protections, occupational injuries were associated with increased risk of voluntary and involuntary <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> for nursing home workers...|$|R

5|$|In 1966, Whitney and Thayer {{attempted}} to organize {{what would have}} been New York's first joint operating agreement (JOA) with the Hearst-owned New York Journal American and the Scripps-owned New York World-Telegram and Sun. Under the proposed agreement, the Herald Tribune would have continued publication as the morning partner and the Journal-American and World-Telegram would merge as the World Journal, an afternoon paper. All three would publish a Sunday edition called the World Journal Tribune. The newspapers would have maintained their own editorial voices (all three of which tended to be conservative). On paper, the JOA, which would have taken effect April 25, 1966, would have led to profits of $4 million to $5 million annually, but would have also led to the loss of 1,764 out of 4,598 employees at the papers. The Newspaper Guild, concerned about the possible <b>job</b> <b>losses,</b> said the new newspaper would have to negotiate a new contract with the union; the publishers refused. The day the JOA was supposed to go into effect, the Guild struck the newly merged newspaper (the Times continued to publish).|$|E
5|$|MacMillan was in {{an awkward}} position. It was widely known that Ashton had been forced out, and many resented it. Company morale was lowered by an announcement, to which MacMillan and Field were party, that the two ballet {{companies}} would merge, with numerous <b>job</b> <b>losses.</b> The managerial side of the post was no more congenial to MacMillan {{than it had been}} in Berlin, and some felt that his creative work suffered during his seven-year term. His expansion of Anastasia into a three-act version (1971) and the other full-length work from this period, Manon (1974), divided opinion, receiving fiercely adverse reviews as well as laudatory ones. His Joplin ballet Elite Syncopations (1974) and Requiem (1976) were immediately successful and have been regularly revived. The latter was dedicated to the memory of Cranko, who had died suddenly in 1973. It was premiered at Stuttgart, because as with Song of the Earth the Royal Opera House board thought the chosen music – Fauré's Requiem – inappropriate for a ballet. The work was not given at Covent Garden until 1983.|$|E

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to fill this void in the literature by using nationally representative household panel data to assess the implications of involuntary <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> for the mental health of family members. We make an important contribution in focusing specifically on the disparity in mental health outcomes following <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> in those families experiencing (i) continued non-employment, (ii) financial stress, and (iii) relationship dissatisfaction. Although we do not estimate mediating effects directly, this focus on heterogeneity in mental health impacts sheds light on the potential pathways through which <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> affects family members. Further, while there is a small literature on the link between partners’ <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> and their spouses’ mental health, ours is the first study to also analyse the broader impact of men’s and women’s <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> on the mental health of their adolescent and young-adult children. Finally, we employ fixed effects models rich in controls in order to account for any selection on observable or time-invariant unobservable individual or family characteristics. We deal with any remaining concerns about the potential endogeneity of <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> by utilising a measure of involuntary <b>job</b> <b>loss,</b> which we argue has certain advantages over other <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> measures used previously in the literature. The robustness of our findings is then tested using an alternative measure of <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> that is both unexpected and involuntary. Together, these innovations allow us to add estimates that are more plausibly causal to what is largely a correlational literature.|$|R
5|$|Similar {{to other}} {{industrial}} {{cities in the}} U.S., Omaha suffered severe <b>job</b> <b>losses</b> in the 1950s, more than 10,000 in total, as both the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. Stockyards and packing plants were located closer to ranches, and union achievements were lost as wages declined in surviving jobs. Many workers left the area {{if they could get}} to other jobs. Poverty deepened in areas of the city whose residents had depended on those jobs, specifically North and South Omaha. At the same time, with reduced revenues, the city had less financial ability to respond to longstanding problems. Despair after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968 contributed to riots in North Omaha, including one at the Logan Fontenelle Housing Project. For some, the Civil Rights Movement in Omaha, Nebraska evolved towards black nationalism, as the Black Panther Party was involved in tensions in the late 1960s. Organizations such as the Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity became popular among the city's African-American youth. This tension culminated in the cause célèbre trial of the Rice/Poindexter Case, in which an Omaha Police Department officer was killed by a bomb while answering an emergency call.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the chairman, Lord Alexander of Weedon, {{announced}} a merger with Legal & General {{in a friendly}} £10.7billion deal, the first between a bank and an insurance company in UK history. The move was poorly received in the London financial markets and NatWest's share price fell substantially. Seen as a driver of the ill-advised investment banking expansion, Derek Wanless {{was forced to resign}} as chief executive following the appointment of Sir David Rowland (who became executive chairman). Also in 1999, in response to the much reduced NatWest market capitalisation, the much smaller Bank of Scotland made a hostile takeover bid for NatWest. The Bank of Scotland's aim was to break up the NatWest Group and dispose of its non-retail assets. NatWest was forced to abandon its merger, but refused to agree to a takeover by a rival bank. The Royal Bank of Scotland tabled another hostile offer and trumped the Bank of Scotland with a £21billion bid. The takeover of NatWest in early 2000 was the biggest in UK history. National Westminster Bank, once Britain's most profitable bank, was delisted from the London Stock Exchange and became, with its subsidiaries, component parts of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group. The outcome of this bitter struggle set the tone for a round of consolidation in the financial sector as it prepared for a new age of fierce global competition. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group became the second largest bank in the UK and Europe (after HSBC) and the fifth largest in the world by market capitalisation. According to Forbes Global 2000, it was then the 13th largest company in the world. NatWest was retained as a distinct brand with its own banking licence, but many back office functions were merged with those of the Royal Bank, leading to over 18,000 <b>job</b> <b>losses.</b>|$|E

Alternatively, it could be that, in the long run, lower-educated men adapt better to continued unemployment or downward mobility. Fixed effects regression analyses show that <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> increases distress, but over time the effect wears off and is limited to non-employed men.

40|$|Becoming {{redundant}} {{or being}} fired is a harmful experience, {{but some people}} may {{be better able to}} deal with it than others. We use the first 17 (1991 - 2007) waves of the British Household Panel Study to examine the effect of involuntary <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> on well-being. More specifically, we study whether level of educational attainment moderates the effect of involuntary <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> on the short (1 st year after <b>job</b> <b>loss)</b> and long term (4 to 6 years). We hypothesize that higher educated people suffer less from an involuntary <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> on the short term because they experience fewer direct stressful effects of <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> and they have better re-employment chances. For the impact of <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> on well-being on the longer term, two competing hypotheses are derived. The first simply extends the short term hypothesis; higher resources and better re-employment chances will cushion the negative effects of <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> for the higher educated. On the other hand, lower aspirations and higher unemployment among peers may lead lower educated individuals to better adapt to being unemployed than higher educated individuals (Clark, Georgellis, & Sanfey, 2001). Fixed effects regression analyses show that, on average, involuntary <b>job</b> <b>loss</b> hurts well-being on the short term, but only for people that left employment {{and to a lesser extent}} for people that were downwardly mobile on the long term.
