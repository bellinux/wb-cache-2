40|$|In {{this chapter}} {{we discuss the}} {{potential}} application of biosensors for the ecotoxicologal risk assessment of xenobiotics in soil environments. In the first part we introduce basic concepts of <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risk</b> assessment, ecotoxicology, environmental fate of xenobiotics, with particular focus on bioavailability processes and their importance in exposure and ecotoxicity of xenobiotics in soils. Specifically, all the main processes controlling the environmental fate of xenobiotics in soils are explained. In the second part we introduce some principles of the functioning of different classes of whole cell biosensors and chemical sensors for xenobiotics of ecotoxicological interests and present some applications and their contribution to improve the ecoxicological risk assessment of xenobiotics in soils. We show how biosensors can be applied together with chemical assessment of bioavailability of xenobiotics in soil to assess <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risk.</b> The application of biosensors to improve the classical risk assessment paradigm is presented, {{in order to show}} how this technology can be used to assess the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risk</b> of xenobiotics in soils. Examples of biosensors with potential application for <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risk</b> assessment are also presented and discussed. The relevance of these studies of environmental health is also acknowledged. We conclude that biosensors technology holds relevant potential for <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risk</b> assessment of xenobiotics in soils...|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{risk limits}} are {{concentrations}} of a substance in water, air, sediment and soil {{that are expected}} to be protective of the environment. In this report environmental risk limits (ERLs) are derived, based on a comparison of human and <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risk</b> limits. <b>Ecotoxicological</b> <b>risk</b> limits, derived previously, were compared to risk limits for human health for the following substances: 1 -butanol, n-butyl acetate, cyclohexylamine, diethylene glycol, ethylene glycol, ethyl acetate, methanol, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), tribromomethane and triethanolamine. The lowest value (human health or ecosystems) determines the final risk limit of a substance. Environmental risk limits based on ectoxicological information were calculated in part 1 of this report (RIVM report 601501016).

40|$|Some {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) and some perfluorinated fire fighting foam constituents (especially perfluorooctane sulfonate, PFOS) were found in deposited soot and in water on Bonaire due to the BOPEC oil depot fires in September 2010. The soot deposition {{did not result in}} elevated concentrations of dioxins, PCBs and heavy metals. The probability and magnitude of human health and <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risks</b> were negligible for the PAHs, {{as well as for the}} dioxins, the PCBs and the metals. For PFOS <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risks</b> cannot be excluded. PFOS-concentrations may diminish over time due to natural removal processes, however, at an unknown speed. Furthermore there is a possibility that PFOS, used in fire fighting agents, may spread into the environment via groundwater. Additional measurements of PFCs in water, sediment, soil and biota should give more information on current PFOS occurrence from all potential exposure routes. This would allow for a more comprehensive risk assessment, including an appropriate risk management strategy. Options for active risk reduction management, other than sanitation of the BOPEC grounds, may be scarce, however, due to specific PFOS characteristics and the vulnerability of the area. When ecotoxicological responses would be observed in the nature reserve in the future, it is recommended to involve a tropical ecologist to investigate an appropriate impact reduction approach. ...|$|R
40|$|Current <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risk</b> {{assessment}} for chemical substances {{is based on}} the assumption that tolerances of all species in a specified ecological community are a priori exchangeable for each new substance.

We show how to estimate parameters and adjust decision rules that are used in <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risk</b> management. Effects of parameter uncertainty are explored and our model is compared with a previously published less tractable alternative.

40|$|Current {{agricultural}} {{models have}} an increasing dependence on non-renewable resources that have significant {{implications for the}} ecosystem health. Pesticides are considered one main impact force that affects both the structure and functions of agroecosystems. In this work we presented results from the application of an environmental pesticide risk assessment of a large database of cropping systems in the Inland Pampa (Argentina) where, since 1990, the traditional mixed grazing&#x 2013;cropping systems were being replaced by permanent agriculture and the intensification of pesticide use has increased significantly. However, {{there is no clear}} awareness of the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risk</b> associated with these land use changes. The <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risk</b> on both insects and mammals were assessed using a fuzzy-logic based model that links, as input variables, the amount the pesticide dose and the lethal dose (LD 50) of each active ingredient use in a single crop field. Thresholds and membership functions were developed by means of expert opinion. A database, containing 29042 records of pesticide use in maize, soybean, sunflower and wheat from 1992 to 2005 were analyzed. Results showed that harvested yield increased significantly in all crops during the period studied (P&#x 3 c; 0. 005). However, these higher yields were associated with higher risks over both insect and mammals as in almost all crops analyzed the fuzzy-logic ecotoxicological indicators showed negative and significant time trend in the period studied (P&#x 3 c; 0. 005, Spearman rank correlation (SRC)). Summer soybean (i. e in the wheat-soybean rotation) did not show any significant tendency regarding changes in potential <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risk</b> during 1992 - 2005 interval. However, soybean (either as summer or spring crop) showed the highest <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risk</b> value in each one of the years analyzed (Kruskal-Wallis test, p &#x 3 c; 0. 05). Regarding the average number of pesticides applied, all crops showed a significant increment from 1992 to 2000 and a subsequent reduction from 2000 to 2005 (SRC, P &#x 3 c; 0. 05) and these reductions were higher in soybean, from 6. 1 to 3. 5 application/year in relation to maize, soybean and sunflower. These preliminary results indicated that higher yield in all the crops analyzed were associated to higher <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risk</b> of the pesticides used. However, further work has to be conducted to improve the fuzzy-logic ecotoxicological model by including variables such human toxicological risk or other chemical pesticide characteristics (i. e. soil persistence, solubility) ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceVery few {{tools are}} {{available}} for assessing the im- pact of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) on receiving aquat- ic environments. The main goal {{of the study was}} to assess the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risk</b> of CSOs for a surface aquatic ecosystem using a coupled “substance and bioassay” approach. Wastewater samples from the city of Longueuil, Canada CSO were collected for various rainfall events during one summer season and analyzed for a large panel of substances (n = 116). Fourbioassayswerealsoconductedonrepresenta- tive organisms of surface aquatic systems (Pimephales promelas, Ceriodaphnia dubia, Daphnia magna, and Oncorhynchus mykiss). The analytical data did not reveal any <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risk</b> for St. Lawrence River organisms, mainly due to strong effluent dilution. However, the substance approach showed that, because of their contribution to the ecotoxicological hazard posed by the effluent, total phospho- rus (Ptot), aluminum (Al), total residual chlorine, chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), pyrene, ammonia (N–NH 4 +), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) require more targeted monitoring. While chronic ecotoxicity tests revealed a potential impact of CSO dis- charges on P. promelas and C. dubia, acute toxicity tests did not show any effect on D. magna or O. mykiss, thus underscoring the importance of chronic toxicity tests as part of efforts aimed at characterizing effluent toxicity. Ultimately, the study leads to the conclusion that the coupled “substance and bioassay” approach is a reliable and robust method for assessing the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risk</b> associated with complex discharges such as CSOs...|$|E

Results showed linear sorption relationships, implying the adequacy of using Kd values to describe partitioning. Desorption measurements were then carried out to assess in-situ Kd values and relate these to soil properties The best transfer functions for solid-solution partitioning were found for Kd values relating total dissolved Cd concentration to total soil Cd concentrations, accounting for the variation in pH, SOM contents and DOC concentrations.

After having formulated a specific methodology in order to assessment <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risk</b> for such a situation, we applied it to the project to build a new hospital shared by several towns in the French Alps. This methodology is based on the ecotoxicological characterisation of the hospital wastewater using a battery of three chronic bioassays (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Heterocypris incongruens and Brachionus calyciflorus) and of genotoxicity tests (Ames fluctuation assay on Salmonella typhimurium, and a Fpg-modified comet assay on the trout liver cell line RTL-W 1). The formulated methodology highlights a moderate risk of the hospital wastewater for the organisms of the water column of the river concerned. Nevertheless, this discharge contributes significantly to the global <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risk</b> when taking into account all the releases of the watershed into the river. This leads to recommending the implementation of a specific treatment system in the urban WWTP, or upstream to it, in view to protecting the aquatic organisms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Its aim is the sustentation of appropriate physical-chemical and biotic soil functions by defining ecological soil quality standardsSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: RN 8908 (93 - 028) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit, Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R
40|$|In summer 2011, the two Russian MIR sub- mersibles {{were brought}} to Switzerland to perform deep water dives in Lake Geneva. Research teams from several {{environmental}} science institutes, both national and inter- national, participated in this interdisciplinary effort to investigate the deeper parts of Lake Geneva. Using the MIRs allowed the scientists to see and precisely select the sites where they could extract specific sediment cores and carry out detailed in situ measurements at the sediment– water boundary. One focus site was the surrounding of the outlet of the wastewater treatment plant of the City of Lausanne, which discharges into the Vidy Bay. The investigations concentrated on the pollution of the local sediments, pollution-related <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>risks,</b> micro- bial activity and spreading and removal of the effluents from the bay to the open waters of the lake. The other focus site was the Rhoˆne River delta and its subaquatic canyons, which formed {{as a result of}} the long-term interplay of the deposition of river-borne sediments and flood-triggered canyon erosion events...|$|R
