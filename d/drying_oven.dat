50|$|In the {{production}} process, {{a solution of}} Saran dissolved in an organic solvent and containing {{a small amount of}} a diazo compound was coated onto a substrate of Mylar. The film was then run through a <b>drying</b> <b>oven</b> to drive off the solvents. The film at this point was clear with a yellow cast from the diazo. In a second process called “cycling,” it was run through a tank of very hot water which created a fog of small holes in the Saran layer. This very greatly increased the photographic speed (light sensitivity) of the film. Several different formulations were in commercial use designed to optimize different photographic parameters for various customers.|$|E
50|$|In 1939 {{he signed}} with RKO Radio Pictures, in Hollywood, for whom he {{produced}} two pictures, including Dance, Girl, Dance and They Knew What They Wanted. Becoming seriously ill in 1941 (he was a chain-smoker and suffered a heart attack), his contract with RKO was not renewed. Between 1942 and 1946, Pommer worked on a few film projects, some of which eventually went into production but without him. Pommer and his wife rented a small apartment and lived off the proceeds {{from the sale of}} personal valuables. They also helped two close friends, Fred Pinkus (a former business manager from Berlin) and his wife, silent movie star Eliza La Porta, who bought chinaware and glasses and then hand-painted them to sell to the higher-class department stores. Pommer's wife helped with the painting, and Pommer alternated with Pinkus to work the <b>drying</b> <b>oven</b> in Pinkus' garage. Having resided continuously in the United States since 1939, Pommer and his wife became naturalized American citizens in 1944.|$|E
50|$|Regardless of type, all mollusk shells {{should be}} {{collected}} using a standardized stratigraphic sampling strategy. Utilizing {{this type of}} strategy avoids the problem of ignoring the collection of smaller shells, an issue that can result from hand-picking. Once samples are collected, they must be sent to a laboratory to be air-dried. A standard weight is then collected for each sample. Each standardized sample is then placed in a plastic bowl (labeled with stratigraphic information) and covered with hot water. Shells float {{to the top and}} are skimmed off into a set of sieves, which separate the shells by size. After shells are removed from the soil, the soil should be covered in a solution of 70% hot water and 30% hydrogen peroxide. Once the mixture fizzes, it is passed through a set of sieves. Both the soil and shells are then placed in the <b>drying</b> <b>oven.</b> After cooling, shells are fully prepared for analysis and can be extracted from the sieves.|$|E

50|$|Materials:Obtain {{a sample}} of mixed liquor. Transfer the sample into a {{laboratory}} in order to analyze it. Measure the volume weight of the sample. Remove two filter papers from a desiccator and record the weight of each. Place the filter holder on a vacuum flask and then place another filter {{on top of the}} filter holder by using a pair of tweezers. Stir the sample of mixed liquor {{in order to get a}} good mixture for the experiment. After sample is mixed, pour 5 mL into a graduated cylinder. Turn on the vacuum pump and pour the sample into the filter holder. After all the mixed liquor has gone through, run three portions of 10 mL distilled water through the filter holder to rinse any particles that may have stuck to the glass. Allow the vacuum pump to run an additional three minutes. This will help remove any extra water from the filter before drying. Switch the vacuum pump off and remove the filter from the filter holder and place in the corresponding weighing dish. Repeat above process for as many trials as needed. Place the filter(s) into a <b>drying</b> <b>oven,</b> which is set to 103°-105° C, for one hour. Upon drying, replace filters into a desiccator for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes in the desiccator, the filters are to be weighed.|$|E
50|$|I was, 1925-6, highly {{interested}} in {{studies on the}} blackberry rusts, short and long cycle forms (species). … I had found that I could pass the rust on the Black Diamond blackberry (dewberry) by grafting to young shoots of this species, {{and was trying to}} culture the rest on cornmeal agar in plates and flasks. So I had several plates and flasks (250 cc) standing on shelves in the Arlington Farm greenhouses. I was much concerned to find that Monila sitophila had gotten into some of the flasks as well as some plates. Practically all of them were soon bearing perithecia resembling those Dr. C. L. Shear had shown me and had asked me to try to germinate the ascospores. I was so much excited and {{interested in}} my rust studies that I could not leave those experiments to help my superior out. I did suggest trying to make those spores germinate by heating them. … Several weeks had passed when this red bread mold developed in my greenhouse flasks and plates. Just on a chance I inverted plates of corn meal agar on cultures of perithecia shooting spores so spores were shot upward and scattered about. I put some of these plates in a <b>drying</b> <b>oven</b> and heated them as I had gone many times to make ascospores of Ascobolus to germinate. By next morning a high percentage of the mold had germinated.|$|E
50|$|Decorative {{laminates}} {{were made}} by impregnating large sheets of kraft paper with phenolic resin, which was then partially cured (B-staged by passing through a long <b>drying</b> <b>oven)</b> and cut to sheet lengths at the oven exit. The dry treated sheets were stiff and somewhat brittle. A decorative sheet (solid colored, or wood-grained, or patterned), impregnated with melamine resin and B-staged and cut to length {{in a similar manner}} to the phenolic core sheets, was laid on a polished stainless steel press plate. Then several plies or layers of kraft paper impregnated with a phenolic resin were placed on top of the decorative layer. The number of plies of kraft used yielded products of varying thickness depending upon end-use requirements. Next, a sheet of release paper that would not bond to the phenolic resin was placed on top of the phenolic kraft and following this a mirror image build-up of the assembly already on the press plate. Finally, another polished stainless steel press plate was placed on top of the pack assembly. On {{the other side of this}} plate another similar assembly was built until there were several laminates in one press pack to go into a single opening in the hydraulic press. The huge hydraulic presses, perhaps 5 feet by 12 feet, had many heated openings thus many laminates could be produced in a single press cycle of about one hour duration. Great pressure (in excess of 1000 psi and heat to 150 degrees Celsius) were applied to each press pack. The B-staged melamine and phenolic resins first flowed to bond the interlaminar plies together, then the plastic resins thermoset to provide a very durable product that could tolerate much heat and abrasion.|$|E
