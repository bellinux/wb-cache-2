40|$|SUMMARY Changes in {{coronary}} arterial size due to <b>ergonovine</b> <b>maleate</b> {{are described}} and quantitated in 90 patients- 18 with typical angina pectoris, 56 with atypical chest pain, nine with variant angina pectoris, and seven heart transplant (allograft) recipients. We observed two angiographic {{changes in the}} diameter of cor-onary arteries: 1) spasm, which was characterized by occlusion or marked (> 85 %) focal or diffuse vessel narrowing, or 2) relatively mild and diffuse vessel narrowing, which was interpreted as the normal phar-macologic response to the drug. Serial bolus injections of 0. 05 mg, 0. 10 mg and 0. 25 mg of <b>ergonovine</b> <b>maleate</b> produced diffuse narrowing of the diameter of coronary arteries of 10 ± 1. 5 %, 16 ± 1. 4 % and 20 ± 1. 3 % (mean ± SEM), respectively, in the 72 patients with anginal syndromes who did not develop coronary spasm. The degree of coronary arterial narrowing was the same in heart transplant recipients and in patients with nor-mally innervated hearts who did not develop coronary spasm. We believe the normal pharmacologic response to <b>ergonovine</b> <b>maleate</b> was due to a direct vasoconstrictor action of the drug; this action was independent of neural control extrinsic to the heart. CORONARY ARTERIAL SPASM is recognized {{as a cause of}} angina pectoris. In attempts to identify patients with this condition, various pharmacologi...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Almost {{every one}} in four women {{experiences}} an incomplete abortion in her life. During the twentieth century, uterine contents were evacuated using either forceps or curettage. Re-evaluation of this treatment seems logical. This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the results of medical treatment of first trimester incomplete abortion with methyl <b>ergonovine</b> <b>maleate.</b> Methods and Materials: An observational, descriptive-analytical and cross-sectional study was designed to assess the effectiveness of a maximum of four doses of 0. 2 mg methyl <b>ergonovine</b> <b>maleate</b> in the treatment of first trimester miscarriage. Patients received serum oxytocin concurrently. A total of 100 women were selected using convenience, consecutive sampling method. If after 24 h, the interface line was seen completely and there was no bleeding, patients were discharged without medications. If not, they received oral methergine for 6 days, qid. Results were analyzed by SPSS 11. 5 software, chi-square and T-tests. Results: A total of 100 women aged between 14 and 45 years were selected. On the whole, methergine was successful in 97 % of patients (injection or orally). Only 13 % of the patients had mild side effects. Conclusion: Methergine is an effective and safe drug for the management of first trimester miscarriage...|$|E

40|$|ReviewThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] middle-aged Coloured man had a 6 -year history of chest pain induced by effort and also experienced at rest. Quite dramatic episodes of associated arrhythmias, specifically 'torsade de pointes' (atypical ventricular tachycardia) and syncope were experienced by the patient, despite the use of numerous anti-arrhythmic and anti-anginal agents. Transmural anteroseptal and non-transmural anterolateral myocardial infarctions were documented {{in the presence of}} a normal left coronary artery (LCA). Severe reversible vasospasm of the right coronary artery (RCA) was provoked with the use of <b>ergonovine</b> (ergometrine) <b>maleate</b> at cardiac catheterization. It is postulated that the cause of the previous myocardial infarctions was significant vasospasm of the LCA branches, and that he was subject to multiple coronary vasospasm, as was highlighted by the visualization of spasm superimposed on atheromatous plaque within the RCA. Furthermore, it is strongly suggested that the potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias, including 'torsade de pointes', were a direct result of coronary vasospasm, which in turn gave rise to his presyncope and syncope attacks. No evidence of sinoatrial node disease could be found. The only risk factor for ischaemic heart disease which applied in his case was heavy cigarette smoking. Control of his disabling symptoms seems to have been achieved by the use of maintenance nifedipine (a calcium-blocking agent) long-acting nitrates (isosorbide dinitrate) and quinidine gluconate, confirming the probable vasospastic aetiology of the 'torsade de pointes'. At no stage was there dangerous prolongation of the QT interval, an oft-quoted prerequisite for this arrhythmia. Some of the more important aspects of coronary vasospasm are discussed; as far as I am aware this is the first patient documented in the literature with 'torsade de pointes' associated with angiographically demonstrated coronary artery spasm.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{feasibility}} and diagnostic role of <b>ergonovine</b> <b>maleate</b> infusion under continuous two-dimensional echocardiographic monitoring for the identification of vasospastic myocardial ischaemia in patients with chest pain at rest not associated with diagnostic ECG changes. One hundred and twenty-eight consecutive patients, selected on the basis of absence of ischaemic ECG changes during angina at rest before or during hospitalization, were enrolled in the study. <b>Ergonovine</b> <b>maleate</b> was L v. administered in scaled doses (from 0025 to 0 - 2 mg at 10 min intervals) under echocardiographic, electrocardiographic and systemic blood pressure monitoring. Wall motion asynergies were observed in 33 patients, accompanied by typical chest pain in 24 patients and by ECG changes in 25 (ST elevation in 13 patients, ST depression in seven, T wave changes in five). All patients were able to complete the test. Non life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias were observed in four patients exclusively in association with ischaemia. In seven patients with a positive test, coronary artery spasm was documented at angiography. In 16 patients with a positive test, the vasospastic event was reproduced by a hyperventilation—echo test or a second ergonovine maleate-echo test performed within 3 days of the first examination. In none of the patients with a negative test was documentation of myocardial ischaemia due to a primary reduction in coronary blood flow. Thus, in patients who do not show ECG changes during chest pain at rest, the ergonovine maleate-echo test is feasible and safe; it permits the recognition of ischaemic episodes on the basis of wall motion abnormalities when conventional 12 -lead ECG-recorded chest pain is non-diagnostic...|$|E

We have recorded esophageal pressure simultaneously with ergonovine infusion during angiography in ten patients without significant arterial stenoses. In two patients their usual chest pain developed associated with esophageal spasm and without changes in coronary vessels. Simultaneous performance of angiography and manometry enhanced the diagnostic yield of provocative testing by showing esophageal motility changes.

40|$|Because an {{increase}} in coronary vascular resistance in response to <b>ergonovine</b> <b>maleate</b> has been suggested as a possible diagnostic aid for variant angina, changes were evaluated in coronary hemodynamics and serial myocardial thallium- 201 perfusion scans in 15 patients without angina and with normal coronary arteries in response to ergonovine (0. 05, 0. 10 and 0. 20 mg intravenously). For the group, heart rate-blood pressure product increased significantly (p < 0. 001) without any change in coronary sinus flow, coronary vascular resistance, myocardial oxygen extraction, arterial-coronary sinus oxygen difference and lactate extraction. In 7 of 15 patients, however, coronary vascular resistance increased (mean 39 %, range 11 to 75 %, probability [p] < 0. 001), and coronary sinus flow decreased (14 %, p < 0. 001), despite {{an increase}} in heart rate-blood pressure product (36 %, p < 0. 02).

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of intracoronary {{injections}} of SIN- 1 (0. 8 mg), the active metabolite of molsidomine, on coronary artery diameters and coronary stenoses. In nine patients with abnormal angiograms measurements were made 4 and 8 minutes after SIN- 1 administration. There was a statistically significant increase in coronary luminal diameter in proximal, medial, and distal segments {{as well as at}} the level of the stenoses. At 4 minutes after administration distal segments showed a mean increase in diameter of 50 %, compared to a mean increase of 26 % in proximal segments. In six patients with normal angiograms SIN- 1 abolished three of four coronary spasms induced by <b>ergonovine</b> <b>maleate.</b> A protective effect of SIN- 1 against the vasoconstrictor effects of ergonovine was still present at 8 minutes after administration.

Provocation of coronary vasospasm with intracoronary <b>ergonovine</b> <b>maleate</b> was performed when baseline coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis or {{there was a strong}} clinical suspicion of coronary spasm. The clinical characteristics were analyzed from 104 consecutive patients (56 ± 9 years of age; 21 females) who were diagnosed with coronary spasm.

40|$|ABSTRACT In 14 {{consecutive}} {{patients with}} variant angina we investigated the possible role of coronary a-adrenergic receptors in {{the genesis of}} coronary spasm. In eight patients, computerized, beat-by-beat analysis of the electrocardiogram recorded during continuous Holter monitoring failed to reveal any increase of heart rate and corrected QT interval (both indexes of cardiac sympathetic activation) in the period preceding the onset of ST segment changes in 197 episodes of ischemia caused by coronary spasm. In the same patients, analysis of the circadian distribution of ischemic episodes revealed a significantly higher incidence {{in the early morning}} hours, when sympathetic activity is at the lowest level. Twelve patients underwent serial provocative testing with cold pressor, phenylephrine, or norepinephrine infusion and administration of <b>ergonovine</b> <b>maleate.</b> Ergonovine consistently repro-duced coronary spasm in all 12 patients, while results of cold pressor testing were positive in only one.

Segments of canine circumflex and right coronary arteries were suspended in organ chambers filled with aerated Krebs-Henseleit solution (37 °C) for continuous isometric tension recordings. Dose-dependent contractions were obtained with norepinephrine (in presence of propranolol) and 5 -hydroxytryptamine; these contractile responses were antagonized by phentolamine and methysergide, respectively. Lidoflazine caused long-lasting, and dose-dependent inhibition of the responses to both norepinephrine and 5 -hydroxytryptamine. High K+ solution (30 mM) caused sustained contraction of the coronary segments; these responses were depressed in a dose-dependent manner by lidoflazine. Lidoflazine slightly augmented relaxations caused by adenosine. Addition of Ca++ to the bath solution partially reversed the inhibitory effect of lidoflazine, which indicates that the compounds acts by inhibiting the influx of extracellular Ca++. Segments incubated in solution containing 20 mM K+ and subjected to anoxia exhibited transient contractions which were inhibited by lidoflazine. <b>Ergonovine</b> <b>maleate</b> caused contractures of the coronary arteries which also were antagonized in a dose-dependent manner by lidoflazine.

In each ischemic attack {{at least one of}} the following transient alterations was observed by 2 DE during ST elevation: (1) Regional hypokinesia, akinesia, or dyskinesia; (2) "step sign," that is, a sharp demarcation between an akinetic or dyskinetic area and an adjacent normal or hypercontracting region; and (3) geometric changes in left ventricular shape, that is, globular appearance in diastole and hourglass silhouette in systole. Regional myocardial asynergy was detected earlier than onset of pain (which was not present in 21 [38 %] ischemic episodes) or ST segment elevation on ECG, as documented in 40 ischemic episodes (16 induced and 24 spontaneous) in which echocardiographic monitoring was performed from basal state and carried on up to the appearance of ischemia. All described mechanical changes were fully reversible after pain subsided and ST segment was back to isoelectric, either spontaneously or with nitrates; furthermore, a contractile "rebound phenomenon" of the previously ischemic wall was observed in some episodes.

Fourteen consecutive patients with single vessel coronary artery disease who had undergone successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty were studied. All patients were given ergometrine maleate (<b>ergonovine</b> <b>maleate)</b> intravenously during repeat cardiac catheterisation six weeks to three months after angioplasty. Five patients demonstrated excessive luminal reduction (spasm) at the site of previous angioplasty that led to luminal stenoses ranging from 50 % to 79 %. Two of these patients developed chest pain and ST segment changes during ergometrine maleate provocation and they also showed maximal vasoconstriction.

Ultrasonic monitoring was performed during the appearance of ST-segment elevation, from onset of pain, during an <b>ergonovine</b> <b>maleate</b> test, hemodynamic monitoring, radioisotopic studies and, occasionally, during routine examinations, when spontaneous episodes occurred. Reliability of findings was supported by two important conditions: each patient acted as his own control, since recording was carried out from basal state to basal state, throughout ischemia, or from ischemia to basal state; behaviour of ischemic walls was {{compared with that of}} non-ischemic ones. Echocardiographic findings in acute myocardial ischemia were similar both in spontaneous and in induced episodes and were mainly characterized by: decrease in contractility indices of the ischemic segment, such as wall motion and percent systolic thickening; increase in left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic diameter, with a decrease in percent fractional shortening; distorted shape of ventricular cavity, transiently deformed as in a "functional" aneurysm; a sharp demarcation between ischemic and non-ischemic adjacent segment, "step sign", was present only in severe cases.

This diagnossis was confirmed on cardiac catheterization, left ventricular cine angiography showing mild mitral insufficiency. M-mode and cross-sectional echocardiograms failed to show the MVP, although phonocardiography documented the intermittent non-ejection click and mid-systolic apical murmur. Ambulatory Holter monitoring showed symptomatic inferolateral myocardial ischaemia, and maximal stress-testing elicited asymptomatic ischaemia in the same zone. Selective coronary angiography delinated a normal left coronary artery and an insignificant fixed obstructive lesion {{in the second part}} of the dominent right coronary artery (RCA).

ST-segment elevation was augmented by 11 (33 %) of the 33 right coronary injections (ACh: 6 / 11 [55 %]; EM: 5 / 22 [23 %]), without coronary spasm, but not by any of the left coronary injections in patients with Brugada syndrome. Ventricular fibrillation was induced by 3 (9 %) of the 33 right coronary injections (ACh: 2 / 11 [18 %]; EM: 1 / 22 [5 %]), but not by any of the left coronary injections. In contrast, neither ST-segment elevation nor VF was observed in any of the control subjects. ConclusionsOur results support the hypothesis that mild ischemia and vagal influences act additively or synergistically with the substrate responsible for the Brugada syndrome to elevate the ST- segment and precipitate VF. These observations suggest that Brugada patients may be at a higher risk for ischemia-related sudden death...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] Black employee exposed to industrial nitroglycerin (NG) in an explosives factory presented with severe precordial pain. The clinical presentation was that of significant transient anteroseptal and anterolateral transmural myocardial ischaemia which responded promptly to sublingual isosorbide dinitrate. Despite being removed from exposure to industrial NG and receiving therapy with long-acting oral nitrates and calcium antagonists, the patient continued to experience repeated attacks of severe retrosternal pain, although transient myocardial ischemia was not demonstrated electrocardiographically during these episodes. Cardiac catheterization revealed a normal myocardial haemodynamic system and selective coronary arteriography delineated coronary arteries free from any obstructive lesions. An ergonovine (ergometrine) maleate provocative test failed to elicit coronary artery spasm, although this was undertaken while the patient was on nitrate and calcium-blocker therapy. Clinical records of previous significant constrictive pericarditis (probably due to tuberculosis) with resultant abnormalities on the ECG complicated the diagnosis. Evaluation was further hindered by the known 'variant pattern' seen on the ECGs {{of members of the}} Black population. We postulate that this patient's clinical features were a direct result of severe vasospasm affecting the left coronary artery; it is also strongly suggested that withdrawal from contact with industrial NG precipitated this potentially lethal coronary vasospasm. The role played by industrial NG in ischaemic heart disease is reviewed, as well as the importance of the 'normal variant pattern' in the assessment of cardiac disease in Black patients. As far as we are aware {{this is the first time}} that the use of the <b>ergonovine</b> <b>maleate</b> provocative test has been documented in the industrial NG withdrawal syndrome.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to use {{intravascular}} ultrasound imaging to examine the presence of occult atherosclerosis at the site of focal vasospasm in angiographically normal or minimally narrowed segments, testing the role of atherosclerosis in the development of vasospasm. Background. Previous clinical and experimental studies have suggested that early atherosclerosis is present at the site of focal vasospasm. However, no clinical data exist demonstrating occult disease at the site of vasospasm at angiographically insignificant stenoses. Methods. Twenty-two patients with chest pain at rest or during exertion, or both, were studied. Vasospasm was provoked by intracoronary administration of <b>ergonovine</b> <b>maleate</b> (0. 01 to 0. 04 mg). After relief of vasospasm by nitroglycerin administration, intravascular ultrasound imaging was performed with a 32 - or 64 -element, 20 -MHz, synthetic aperture array ultrasound device. Results. Focal vasospasm (arterial diameter reduction ≥ 90 %) with ST-T segment elevation was provoked in 15 patients: in the left anterior descending coronary artery in 8 patients and in the right coronary artery in 7. The remaining seven patients (control group) showed diffuse narrowing, 22 ± 12 % (mean ± SD) in diameter from the baseline angiograms after ergonovine administration. Atherosclerosis, defined as a significantly thickened intimal leading edge (0. 42 ± 0. 07 mm) associated with an increased sonolucent zone (0. 57 ± 0. 30 mm), was detected by ultrasound at all 15 sites with focal vasospasm, although these sites were normal or minimally narrowed by angiography. In contrast, seven segments from the control group exhibited a thin intimal leading edge (0. 14 ± 0. 04 mm, p < 0. 01) and sonolucent zone (0. 10 ± 0. 07 mm, p < 0. 01), indicating the absence of localized atherosclerotic lesions. Conclusions. These results indicate that atherosclerosis is present at the site of focal vasospasm, even in the absence of angiographically significant coronary disease. We suggest that the existence of such atherosclerotic lesions is related to the occurrence of focal vasospasm in the clinical settings...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. In {{patients}} with chest pain suggestive of variant angina, we performed this prospective study {{to test the}} specificity and diagnostic validity of ergonovine echocardiography (detection of regional wall motion abnormality during bedside ergonovine challenge) as a screening procedure before coronary angiography. Background. Spasm provocation test outside the catheterization room has generally not been accepted as a safe diagnostic method. Methods. Ergonovine echocardiography was performed in 80 consecutive {{patients with}} chest pain syndrome after confirmation of negative treadmill or normal stress myocardial perfusion scan results using thallium- 201. A bolus of <b>ergonovine</b> <b>maleate</b> was injected at 5 -min intervals up to a total cumulative dosage of 0. 35 mg with echocardiographic monitoring of left ventricular wall motion. A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was also recorded every 3 min after each ergonovine injection. Positive test results were development of regional wall motion abnormalities or transient ST segment elevation or depression > 0. 1 mV in any single lead of the 12 -lead ECG. Coronary angiography was undertaken within 2 ± 4 days (mean ± SD) after ergonovine echocardiography, and the spasm provocation test with acetylcholine or ergonovine was performed in patients with normal angiographic findings or lumen diameter narrowing < 70 %. Results. On the basis of angiographic criteria, 56 patients had coronary vasospasm; this finding was later ruled out in 19 patients with near-normal angiographic results by a negative response on the spasm provocation test. In the remaining five patients, coronary spasm provocation was not performed because they revealed {{a high degree of}} fixed stenosis (lumen diameter narrowing 97 ± 4 %). Ergonovine echocardiography could diagnose coronary vasospasm before angiography, with a sensitivity of 91 % (51 of 56 patients, 95 % confidence interval [ci] 84 % to 98 %) and specificity of 88 % (21 of 24 patients, 95 % CI 75 % to 100 %). Of 53 patients showing regional wall motion abnormalities during ergonovine echocardiography, characteristic ST segment elevation in the simultaneously recorded ECG was observed in only 20 (38 %). There were no complications, including myocardial infarction or fatal arrhythmia, during the test. Conclusions. Ergonovine echocardiography before coronary angiography is safe and {{can be used as a}} reliable diagnostic screening test for coronary vasospasm in patients with negative treadmill or normal stress myocardial perfusion scan results. These findings suggest that invasive coronary angiography can be avoided in selected patients for the diagnosis of vasospastic angina...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of diagnosing vasospastic angina based on coronary artery tone as assessed by M-mode echocardiographic measurement of the dilation response of the left main coronary artery to nitroglycerin. Background. The definite diagnosis of vasospastic angina is done by a coronary spasm provocative test using <b>ergonovine</b> <b>maleate</b> or acetylcholine during cardiac catherization. Current noninvasive, nonpharmacologic diagnostic methods are not sensitive enough for the diagnosis of vasospastic angina. Methods. Thirty-eight patients who had an angiographically normal left main trunk were studied. These patients were classified into four groups based on the presence or absence of more than 50 % stenosis in the coronary arteries except for the left main trunk and the results of the acetylcholine or ergonovine provocative test. At 7 a. m. and at noon on the same day, the left main trunk diameter was measured by M-mode echocardiography before and after sublingual administration of nitroglycerin (0. 3 mg), and its percent dilation was calculated to assess coronary artery tone. Results. The percent dilation of the left main trunk diameter induced by sublingual nitroglycerin at 7 a. m. and at noon was 22. 4 ± 4. 7 % (mean ± SD) and 18. 1 ± 4. 0 % in 11 patients with vasospastic angina and without coronary stenosis, 14. 9 ± 7. 1 % and 11. 2 ± 6. 9 % in 9 patients with vasospastic angina and coronary stenosis, 6. 1 ± 3. 5 % and 7. 0 ± 5. 1 % in 8 patients without vasospastic angina but with coronary stenosis and 8. 1 ± 5. 6 % and 7. 8 ± 5. 7 % in 10 control subjects. The percent dilation at 7 a. m. was significantly greater in the vasospastic angina without coronary stenosis group than in the remaining three groups, and in the vasospastic angina groups, the percent dilation at 7 a. m. was significantly greater than that at noon. When percent dilation at 7 a. m. exceeding 15 % was defined as positive for the diagnosis of vasospastic angina, the sensitivity was 80 % and the specificity 94 %. Conclusions. Basal tone of the left main trunk is elevated in the early morning in vasospastic angina. Dilation of the left main trunk diameter exceeding 15 % induced by sublingual nitroglycerin in the early morning as measured by M-mode echocardiography is a highly sensitive and specific criterion for the diagnosis of vasospastic angina...|$|E
