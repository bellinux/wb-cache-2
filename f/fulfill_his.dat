5|$|A tantric {{interpretation}} sees Shiva as {{consciousness and}} Kali as power or energy. Consciousness and energy are dependent upon each other, since Shiva depends on Shakti, or energy, {{in order to}} <b>fulfill</b> <b>his</b> role in creation, preservation, and destruction. In this view, without Shakti, Shiva is a corpse — unable to act.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} the next city, the player {{is asked to}} deliver a parcel to Professor Oak.

5|$|Sherman's {{greatest}} {{contribution to}} the war, the strategy of total warfare—endorsed by General Grant and President Lincoln—has {{been the subject of}} controversy. Sherman himself downplayed his role in conducting total war, often saying that he was simply carrying out orders as best he could in order to <b>fulfill</b> <b>his</b> part of Grant's master plan for ending the war.|$|E
5|$|Action {{was taken}} against Landy's {{professional}} {{practice as a}} result of the Beach Boys' and Wilson family's struggles for control. A former nurse and girlfriend of Wilson's brought Landy to the state's attention in 1984, and they were then aided by journals written by songwriter Gary Usher during a ten-month collaboration with Wilson. These journals depicted Wilson as a virtual captive dominated by Landy, who was determined to <b>fulfill</b> <b>his</b> show business ambitions through Wilson. By this time, Wilson had become Landy's only patient.|$|E
5|$|In November 2004, Ledonne {{discovered}} {{a program called}} RPG Maker, which allows a developer to add images, text, story and objectives to design a game; RPG Maker creates the necessary programming automatically. Ledonne had always conceptualized video games throughout his childhood but never produced one due to his lack of technical knowledge; with RPG Maker {{he was able to}} <b>fulfill</b> <b>his</b> ambition. Ledonne decided to make a game that would explore why the Columbine shootings occurred, as well as refuting pervasive myths about the shooters and the alleged role video games played in the massacre.|$|E

5|$|On {{his arrival}} at Alexandria, Cleomenes {{was greeted by}} Ptolemy, who welcomed him with smiles and promises. At first Ptolemy was guarded towards Cleomenes, but soon came to respect him and promised to send him back to Greece with an army and a fleet. He also promised to provide Cleomenes with an annual income of twenty-four talents. However, before he could <b>fulfill</b> <b>his</b> promise, Ptolemy died—and with him any hope for Cleomenes to return to Greece, as the weak Ptolemy IV ascended the throne.|$|E
5|$|The {{private sector}} {{was not the}} only source of racism: under President Wilson, the plight of African Americans in {{government}} jobs suffered. Many federal agencies adopted whites-only employment practices, the Army excluded blacks from officer ranks, and the immigration service prohibited the immigration of persons of African ancestry. Du Bois wrote an editorial in 1914 deploring the dismissal of blacks from federal posts, and he supported William Monroe Trotter when Trotter brusquely confronted Wilson about Wilson's failure to <b>fulfill</b> <b>his</b> campaign promise of justice for blacks.|$|E
5|$|A demon {{comes to}} steal the ring from Thalaba, but he is stopped by the young boy. This allows Thalaba to demand {{information}} about the sorcerers and why his family was killed. Time passes and Thalaba settles into a pastoral life at Irem and plans to marry Moath's daughter, Oneiza. However, Thalaba decides that his duty prohibits him from such actions, and he leaves to <b>fulfill</b> <b>his</b> destiny. However, the sorcerer Lobaba tricks Thalaba and tries {{to steal the}} ring. After many failed attempts, Lobaba tries to convince Thalaba to harness the ring's magic power, which would bring Thalaba harm. Instead, Thalaba argues {{against the use of}} magic in general and realises that Lobaba is evil. Although Thalaba attempts to kill Lobaba and fails by the sorcerer's magic, a storm comes and destroys the sorcerer.|$|E

5|$|After the referendum, Chrétien {{attempted}} to pursue constitutional recognition of distinct society, but {{was stopped by}} the blunt refusal of Ontario Premier Mike Harris to discuss any constitutional matters. Not wanting to engage the same negotiations with provincial governments that had dominated the Trudeau and Mulroney governments, Chrétien opted to pursue unilateral Federal changes to <b>fulfill</b> <b>his</b> government's commitments. This included the Act respecting constitutional amendments, which required permission from the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia for Federal approval to be granted to any Constitutional amendment, granting Quebec a de facto veto. The Federal parliament also officially recognized Quebec as a distinct society. Both changes, not being constitutional amendments, are theoretically reversible by future parliaments.|$|E
5|$|As the Muslim {{forces were}} {{geographically}} divided, Heraclius sought to exploit this situation {{and planned to}} attack. He {{did not wish to}} engage in a single pitched battle but rather to employ central position and fight the enemy in detail by concentrating large forces against each of the Muslim corps before they could consolidate their troops. By forcing the Muslims to retreat, or by destroying Muslim forces separately, he would <b>fulfill</b> <b>his</b> strategy of recapturing lost territory. Reinforcements were sent to Caesarea under Heraclius' son Constantine III probably to tie down Yazid's forces which were besieging the town. The Byzantine imperial army moved out from Antioch and Northern Syria sometime in the middle of June 636.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} June 1860, Rossier was in Shanghai, and it {{is likely}} that he visited the city in an attempt to gain {{permission}} to accompany the Anglo-French military expedition that had already arrived in northern China and thereby <b>fulfill</b> <b>his</b> commission to document the Second Opium War. If so, he was unsuccessful; both forces had already hired photographers to document the mission. The British forces were accompanied by the photographers Felice Beato and John Papillon, and the French by Antoine Fauchery, Lieutenant-Colonel Du Pin, and possibly also by Louis Legrand. Although Rossier failed even to embark on the mission he had been hired to document, he remained in East Asia for some time longer.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the maximum}} calibre of naval gun allowed under the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was 40.6cm (16inch), Hitler soon had second {{thoughts}} about the guns {{to be used for}} the new ships and ordered that they be armed with 38cm (15inch) weapons. However, the 28.3cm turrets were readily available; 38cm turrets would take years to develop, and Hitler wanted capital ships as soon as possible to <b>fulfill</b> <b>his</b> political ideals. He was also reminded that, despite the allowances of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the British had historically been sensitive about increases in main gun calibers aboard German capital ships. He therefore acquiesced to the ships' being armed with 28.3cm guns, with the provision that they be upgunned to 38cm at the earliest opportunity. The 38cm turret was eventually used in the s.|$|E
5|$|Bowie renounced his American {{citizenship}} {{and became a}} Mexican citizen on September 30, 1830, after promising to establish textile mills {{in the state of}} Coahuila y Tejas. To <b>fulfill</b> <b>his</b> promise, Bowie entered into partnership with Veramendi to build cotton and wool mills in Saltillo. With his citizenship assured, Bowie now had the right to buy up to 11leagues of public land. He convinced 14 or 15 other citizens to apply for land in order to turn it over to him, giving him 700,000acres (280,000ha) for speculation. Bowie may have been the first to induce settlers to apply for empresario grants, which could then be sold in bulk to speculators as Bowie had. The Mexican government passed laws in 1834 and 1835 that stopped much of the land speculation.|$|E
5|$|Del Potro {{played in}} the Davis Cup Final, with the title {{on the line and}} looking to <b>fulfill</b> <b>his</b> {{childhood}} dream. He lost in the second rubber to David Ferrer, despite being two sets to one up, eventually losing in a pulsating five-set contest in a match lasting over five hours. With his country down 2–1, del Potro needed to beat Rafael Nadal in the reverse singles to keep the tie going. Del Potro dominated the first set, but could not keep his level up and lost in four sets. For the third time in six years, Argentina lost in the finals of the Davis Cup World Group, this time 3–1.|$|E

5|$|In July 1216, {{the newly}} elected Pope Honorius III once again called upon Andrew to <b>fulfill</b> <b>his</b> father's vow to lead a crusade. Andrew, who had {{postponed}} the crusade {{at least three times}} (in 1201, 1209 and 1213), finally agreed. Steven Runciman, Tibor Almási and other modern historians say that Andrew hoped that his decision would increase his likelihood of being elected as Latin Emperor of Constantinople, because his wife's uncle, Emperor Henry, had died in June. According to a letter written by Pope Honorius in 1217, envoys from the Latin Empire had actually informed Andrew that they planned to elect either him or his father-in-law, Peter of Courtenay, as emperor. The barons of the Latin Empire elected Peter of Courtenay in the summer of 1216.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} level, Conan has {{retrieved}} {{all of his}} armor and returns to Parad Isle to rescue A'kanna from her father. After a long boss fight and several button-pressing sequences, Conan slays the wizard {{at the bottom of}} the ocean. Graven's defeat frees the gods he had imprisoned, and they bring him back to life for eternal punishment. The story ends with the separation of the barbarian and the warrior queen. Conan goes on to <b>fulfill</b> <b>his</b> destiny to be a king as written in Howard's stories. A'kanna, however, grows old in a village, telling stories to children and never forgetting Conan.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, the Nasution {{siblings}} {{formed a}} band; Chrisye and Joris watched them play songs by Uriah Heep and Blood, Sweat & Tears. In 1968 Chrisye registered at the Christian University of Indonesia (UKI) to <b>fulfill</b> <b>his</b> father's wish that he become an engineer. Around 1969, however, Gauri {{invited him to}} join the Nasutions' band, Sabda Nada, {{as a replacement for}} their bassist Eddi Odek who was ill. Pleased with his performance, the Nasutions asked him to stay as a permanent member. The group had a regular gig at Mini Disko on Juanda Street and freelanced at birthday and wedding parties. When Chrisye had a chance to sing while performing covers, he attempted to sound as much like the original artist as he could.|$|E
