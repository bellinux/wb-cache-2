In {{the first few}} years of operation, interest rates were well above market rates. <b>Interest</b> <b>expense</b> stood at around NT$1.3billion per month in April 2008, when THSRC first achieved break-even cash flow, with revenue and cash expenses (which exclude depreciation) both around NT$2.1billion. Interest rates fell in the first half of 2009, reducing interest expenses and contributing to a reduced net loss.|$|E
25|$|CBO {{reported}} that net {{interest on the}} public debt was approximately $240 billion in FY2016 (6% of spending), an increase of $17 billion or 8% versus FY2015. A higher level of debt coincided with higher interest rates. During FY2012, the GAO reported a figure of $245 billion, down from $251 billion. Government also accrued a non-cash <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> of $187 billion for intra-governmental debt, primarily the Social Security Trust Fund, for a total <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> of $432 billion. GAO {{reported that}} even though the national debt rose in FY2012, the interest rate paid declined. Should interest rates rise to historical averages, the interest cost would increase dramatically.|$|E

Cameron said that doing things differently would not have saved the taxpayer any money, as he was paying more on mortgage interest than he was able to reclaim as expenses anyway He also spoke out in favour of laws giving voters the power to [...] "recall" [...] or [...] "sack" [...] MPs accused of wrongdoing. In April 2014, he was criticised for his handling of the expenses row surrounding Culture Secretary Maria Miller, when he rejected calls from fellow Conservative MPs to sack her from the front bench.|$|E

40|$|Using bank-level {{data from}} 84 countries, {{we find that}} {{a higher degree of}} bank {{internationalization}} is associated with higher <b>interest</b> <b>expenses.</b> Internationalization is proxied by a bank's share of foreign liabilities in total liabilities or a Herfindahl index of international liability concentration. Bank <b>interest</b> <b>expenses</b> rise relatively more with internationalization if the bank is underperforming or headquartered in a country with weak public finances, and especially at times of weak world output growth.
