5|$|In 1911 A.R. Angus, an Australian inventor, brought two {{locomotives}} {{onto the}} lower {{section of the}} line to test and demonstrate an automatic signal warning device. The demonstration of the system took place at Kentsford on 5 July 1912, which turned into something of a gala for local people, watching two hired GWR tender locos, the only tender locos to work this line, being brought safely to a halt rather than the anticipated <b>head-on</b> <b>collision.</b> <b>Testing</b> of this system continued intermittently until the outbreak of war.|$|R
50|$|In 1911 A.R. Angus, an Australian inventor, leased the Watchet-Washford {{section of}} the line to test and {{demonstrate}} an automatic signal warning device. He put the stretch into good order and installed a telephone line between the two stations. The demonstration of the system took place at Kentsford on 5 July 1912, which turned into something of a gala for local people, watching two hired GWR tender locos, the only tender locos to work this line, being brought safely to a halt rather than the anticipated <b>head-on</b> <b>collision.</b> <b>Testing</b> of this system continued intermittently until the outbreak of war.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{development}} of the chassis, Ford learned that its initial design caused smaller vehicles (such as a Ford Taurus) to become severely overridden in a <b>head-on</b> <b>collision.</b> In the <b>test,</b> the tire of the Excursion drove up to the windshield of the Taurus, reducing the chance of survival for the Taurus driver. [...] As a response, Ford modified the chassis to include an under-bumper [...] "blocker beam"; the device was initially tested by the French transportation ministry in 1971. [...] For the rear of the chassis, Ford chose to include a trailer hitch as standard equipment in production to reduce underriding in rear-end collisions by smaller vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) {{gave the}} 1997 Chevrolet Venture {{a rating of}} four stars out of five in a <b>head-on</b> <b>collision,</b> and five stars in the side-impact <b>collision.</b> <b>Tests</b> on {{subsequent}} model years yielded results of four stars in most categories, and three or five stars in others. The NHTSA does not conduct offset frontal crash tests.|$|R

50|$|The {{railroad}} {{reached the}} town in 1859-1860. Railroad accidents were not uncommon. On November 9, 1909, a crew member {{was killed in a}} <b>head-on</b> <b>collision</b> between two locomotives, just north of the rail intersection with Main Street. Near the same place, on March 12, 1913, another <b>head-on</b> <b>collision</b> killed one of the crew.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the <b>head-on</b> <b>collision</b> of two opposite-charged point particles moving {{at the speed}} of light. Starting from the field of a single charge we derive in a first step the field generated by uniformly accelerated charge in the limit of infinite acceleration. From this we then calculate explicitly the burst of radiation emitted from the <b>head-on</b> <b>collision</b> of two charges and discuss its distributional structure. The motivation for our investigation comes from the corresponding gravitational situation where the <b>head-on</b> <b>collision</b> of two ultrarelativistic particles (black holes) has recently aroused renewed interest.

50|$|On 10 July 1932, {{during the}} second {{operating}} season of the line, a <b>head-on</b> <b>collision</b> took place at Beach station, in which the engine driver, Herbert Carr, aged 25, was killed and 31 passengers were injured. A second <b>head-on</b> <b>collision</b> took place on Monday 23 August 1948 and although 9 people were injured, this time there were no fatalities.|$|R
50|$|<b>Head-on</b> <b>collisions</b> {{often have}} poor {{outcomes}} {{because of the}} speed involved when the collision takes place. The typical cause of <b>head-on</b> <b>collisions</b> is when one vehicle inadvertently strays {{into the path of}} an oncoming vehicle. However, the root cause sometimes lies in a steering overcorrection after veering {{to the side of the}} road as opposed to the centre.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} conjectured that in <b>head-on</b> <b>collisions</b> of neutron stars (NSs), the merged object would not {{collapse}} promptly {{even if the}} total mass {{is higher than the}} maximum stable mass of a cold NS. In this paper, we show that the reverse is true: even if the total mass is less than the maximum stable mass, the merged object can collapse promptly. We demonstrate this for the case of NSs with a realistic equation of state (the Lattimer-Swesty EOS) in head-on and near <b>head-on</b> <b>collisions.</b> We propose a "Prompt Collapse Conjecture" for a generic NS EOS for head on and near <b>head-on</b> <b>collisions.</b> Comment: 5 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Phy.
