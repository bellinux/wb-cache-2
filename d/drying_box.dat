40|$|The {{disposal}} of fine-grained mining and industrial waste by formation of hydraulic-fill tailings dams {{is becoming a}} design and construction activity of increasing scale. In light of the increasing pressure on the mining industry to sustain stringent safety and environmental standards it is becoming more important to gain technical knowledge of the waste problem. The upper layers of the tailings residue dams are in the unsaturated state with the matric suction component contributing to the overall shear strength. The ability to incorporate the matric suction component in shear strength calculations is important to safe design. This research project investigates {{the use of the}} mid-plane suction probe to measure matric suction. The results obtained from the probe is used along with various tests to construct a complete soil-water characteristic curve for Mispah gold tailings as well as to investigate suction induced shear strength of drying tailings with depth. The tests were conducted on gold tailings from Vaal Operation’s Mispah tailings dam. The laboratory tests consisted of a trough test, to determine the soil-water characteristics of the gold tailing and also a <b>drying</b> <b>box</b> test that simulated the drying and desiccation of the gold tailings in the daywall. The project concluded that the mid-plane suction probe could be used with acceptable accuracy to determine soil suctions. The model for the prediction of the soil water characteristic curve, derived by Fredlund and Xing (1992), was used successfully to predict the complete soil water characteristics curve for Mispah gold tailings. The equation derived by Vanapalli et al. (1996) was successfully used to calculate both the normal and suction induced shear strength of gold mine tailings using either the volumetric water content from the extracted samples or from the soil water characteristic curve.

40|$|South Africa, {{with its}} world {{leadership}} in the mining sector, and well-developed industrial sector, understandably has many tailings dams of various types. South Africa’s tailings dams are among {{the largest in the}} world in terms of delivered tailings tonnages, plan size and height. Obviously tailings disposal from the mining and industrial sectors in South Africa can have a major impact on the environment and the safety of human life if the dam design and tailings deposition process are not properly controlled. In South Africa there is a growing awareness of the importance of the environment and of the safety of the tailings dams. Catastrophes like the Merriespruit Gold Tailings dam failure in February 1994, where 17 people died and widespread devastation and environmental damage was caused, has sparked the renewal of research into tailings dam stability and safety. The rate of rise of tailings dams has an influence on the safety and stability of a tailings dam. If rate at which a tailings dam is built is too high, the dam may become unstable and be at risk of failure. There are many factors that control the rate of rise of tailings dams that are not very well understood. This research deals with sedimentation and desiccation of gold mine tailings. Sedimentation and desiccation are factors that influence the rate of rise. This research looked at how the gold mine tailings behave when sedimentation and desiccation occur. This was achieved through laboratory experiments, which consisted of column settling tests and <b>drying</b> <b>box</b> tests, and field tests. A model that predicts the behaviour of sedimentation and desiccation of tailings was also analysed. It was found that tailings sedimentation occurs very quickly. It was also found that suctions play an important role during the desiccation of the tailings. Dissertation (MEng (Geotechnical Engineering)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) is {{a widespread}} pathogen that can lay dormant in healthy individuals and establish lifelong latent infection. This successful co-existence is facilitated {{by a number of}} viral gene products that manipulate host cellular functions and immune responses. Among these immunomodulatory genes are four G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) encoded by HCMV, designated US 27, US 28, UL 33, and UL 78. Studies have shown the US 28 gene product to be a functional chemokine receptor that signals both constitutively and in a ligand-dependent manner, resulting {{in a wide range of}} cellular effects. In previous work, we have found that US 27 expression results in at least two biological effects: enhanced CXCR 4 signaling and increased in cellular proliferation in HEK 293 cells. Here, we examined the involvement of two protein domains, the <b>DRY</b> <b>box</b> and the C-terminal intracellular domain (CTD) of US 27, in mediating both cell proliferation and survival. While both domains were required for a proliferative effect, loss of either domain only moderately impacted cell survival, suggesting that US 27 may interact with cell survival pathways through protein regions other than the <b>DRY</b> <b>box</b> and CTD. Quantitative RT-PCR arrays were used to profile changes in cellular gene expression in the HEK 293 -US 27 cell line, and down-regulation of cell cycle regulators CDKN 1 A/p 21 /CIP 1 (cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A) and SESN (Sestrin 2 or Hi 95) was observed.
