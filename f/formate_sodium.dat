50|$|The {{phenomenon}} of freezing-point depression has many practical uses. The radiator fluid {{in an automobile}} {{is a mixture of}} water and ethylene glycol. As a result of freezing-point depression, radiators do not freeze in winter (unless it is extremely cold, e.g. -30 to -40 C). Road salting takes advantage of this effect to lower the freezing point of the ice it is placed on. Lowering the freezing point allows the street ice to melt at lower temperatures, preventing the accumulation of dangerous, slippery ice. Commonly used sodium chloride can depress the freezing point of water to about -21 C. If the road surface temperature is lower NaCl becomes ineffective and other salts are used, such as calcium chloride, magnesium chloride or a mixture of many. These salts are somewhat aggressive to metals, especially iron, so in airports safer media such as sodium formate, potassium <b>formate,</b> <b>sodium</b> acetate, potassium acetate are used instead.|$|E

Sodium <b>formate,</b> <b>sodium</b> acetate, sodium succinate, sodium pyruvate and sodium methanesulfonate (Na-MSA) particles crystallize as the relative humidity (RH) decreases and they deliquesce as the RH increases. Sodium oxalate and ammonium oxalate form supersaturated particles at low RH before crystallization {{but they do}} not deliquesce even at RH = 90 %. Sodium malonate and sodium maleate particles neither crystallize nor deliquesce. These two salts absorb and evaporate water reversibly without hysteresis. In most cases, the solid states of single particles resulting from the crystallization of supersaturated droplets do not form the most thermodynamically stable state found in bulk studies. Sodium <b>formate,</b> <b>sodium</b> oxalate, ammonium oxalate, sodium succinate, sodium pyruvate and Na-MSA form anhydrous particles after crystallization. Sodium acetate forms particles with a water/salt molar ratio of 0. 5 after crystallization. In salts with several hydrated states including sodium formate and sodium acetate, the particles deliquesce at the lowest deliquescence relative humidity (DRH) of the hydrates. Except sodium oxalate and ammonium oxalate, all the salts studied here are as hygroscopic as typical inorganic hygroscopic aerosols. The hygroscopic organic salts have a growth factor of 1. 76 - 2. 18 from RH = 10 - 90 %, comparable to that of typical hygroscopic inorganic salts such as NaCl and (NH 4) (2) SO 4. Further study of other atmospheric water-soluble organic compounds and their mixtures with inorganic salts is needed to explain the field observations of the hygroscopic growth of ambient aerosols.

One effective {{way to do this is}} to precipitate the radioactive elements with manganese solids, produced by permanganate oxidation. When added to tank waste, the permanganate reacts quickly producing manganese (IV) dioxide precipitate. Because of the speed of the reaction it is difficult to tell what exactly is happening. Individual reactions using non-radioactive reductants found in the tanks were done to determine reaction kinetics, what permanganate was reduced to, and what oxidation products were formed. In this project sodium <b>formate,</b> <b>sodium</b> nitrite, glycolic acid, glycine, and sodium oxalate were studied using various concentrations of reductant in alkaline sodium hydroxide solutions. It was determined that formate reacted the quickest, followed by glycine and glycolic acid. Oxalate and nitrite did not appear to react with the permanganate solutions. The products of the oxidation reaction were examined. Formate was oxidized to carbonate and water. Glycolic acid was oxidized slower producing oxalate and water.

The purified enzyme was determined to consist of six subunits (65, 33, 28, 23, 21 and 18 kDa), similar to hydrogenase- 3 from Escherichia coli, and therefore it was named Hyd 3. The enzyme displayed remarkable oxygen tolerance. For the purified enzyme, 50 % maximal activity was maintained following incubation for 24 h in air at room temperature. The hydrogenase gene cluster (hyc) was cloned and found to consist of hycD, hycE, hycF, hycdG, hycH and hycI genes. hycE and hycG genes encode for the large and small subunit of the hydrogenase, respectively. A hycE gene deletion mutant, Delta hycE, was constructed for elucidating the function of the hyc-operon in hydrogen metabolism. Compared with the wild type strain HP 1, the mutant strain showed a dramatic decrease in hydrogen production in the presence of <b>formate,</b> <b>sodium</b> pyruvate and glucose under O(2) -stressed conditions, while substantial activity was detected under anaerobic conditions. This strongly suggests that K. oxytoca HP 1 carries a number of hydrogenases or hydrogen metabolic pathways independently of Hyd 3.

There were four replicates per treatment and the silos were stored for 132 days. DIFF silage made without additive was poorly fermented. All additives increased the extent and improved the direction of DIFF silage fermentation, and reduced in-silo losses. However, MIX did not reduce butyric acid concentration and increased the extent of aerobic deterioration. LAB had a smaller effect on fermentation and in-silo losses than FA. With EASI silages, all additives restricted the extent of fermentation and improved fermentation quality, with the latter effect being smaller than for DIFF silages. LAB promoted a particularly homolactic fermentation but subsequently increased aerobic deterioration. In both DIFF and EASI silages additive treatment improved in vitro digestibility. It is concluded that only ATF 1, ATF 2 and MIX were as effective as FA at improving silage preservation and reducing in-silo losses with both DIFF and EASI herbages. However, ATF 1 and ATF 2 were superior in reducing the apparent extent of proteolysis and MIX was slightly less effective at reducing the activity of saccharolytic Clostridia. peer-reviewe...|$|E

The position of the ions in the Hofmeister series and their free energy of hydration (ΔGhyd) were used to explain the ability of the ions to induce PEG salting-out.

40|$|The {{hygroscopicity}} {{of water}} soluble organic compounds (WSOCs) {{plays an important}} role in many applications such as pharmaceutical and food industries and atmospheric science. Unfortunately, most work on hygroscopicity has been focused only on inorganics. In this project, the equilibrium water sorption and desorption characteristics (i. e., the water cycle) of a series of WSOCs using an electrodynamic balance (EDB) was studied. In the EDB, a combination of AC and DC fields is used to trap and levitate a charged particle. The mass of the particle undergoing evaporation or condensation is proportional to the DC voltage required to balance the particle stagnant. The WSOCs studied include four respiratory drugs (atropine sulfate (AS), isoproterenol hydrochloride (IPHC) and isoproterenol hemisulfate (IPHS) and disodium cromoglycate (DSCG)), three model additives in pharmaceutical formulations (glucose, citric acid and sorbitol) and nine atmospheric WSOCs. Measurements of the drugs were made at 37 ℃ and those of the model additives and atmospheric WSOCs were made at 25 ℃. Combining the bulk water activity (aw) measurements with the EDB measurements, the equilibrium relationship between particle composition and aw of each species was obtained. The growth ratios of the WSOCs were also estimated. Compared with typical inorganic species which exhibit efflorescence and deliquescence in the water cycle, most of the WSOCs studied (all the pharmaceuticals, additives and some atmospheric species (sodium malonate and sodium maleate) studied) do not effloresce nor deliquesce. They sorb and desorb water reversibly in the water cycle. The other atmospheric WSOCs (sodium <b>formate,</b> <b>sodium</b> acetate, sodium succinate, sodium pyruvate and sodium methanesulfonate (Na-MSA)) demonstrated similar behaviors as typical inorganic salts. Residual water exists in the particles of some species when RH is very low. In most cases, the solid states of single particles resulted from crystallization of supersaturated droplets do not form the most thermodynamically stable state found in bulk studies. The findings of this project clearly show that many WSOCs can be as hygroscopic as typical inorganic species but they also have hygroscopic characteristics very different from those of inorganic deliquescent species...|$|E
