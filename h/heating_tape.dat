In a second experiment, that of flow and heat transfer around a simulated drift, a low, constant heat flux boundary condition on the heater has been used. Two different admitted water quantities, 200 ml and 300 ml, have been used as before. The response of temperatures and relative humidity in the porous medium and annulus are very similar to the results of the high constant heat flux on the case of 300 ml water experiments.

40|$|For years, {{additives}} {{have been}} used to tailor solid propellant behavior for specific applications. The propellant is often exposed to harsh environments during combustion such as extreme temperatures and high pressures. While the burning rates of AP/HTPB-based solid rocket propellants up to pressures of 2000 psi are well documented, relatively little data at higher pressures exists. Therefore, a new high-pressure, constant-volume strand burner facility has been installed and characterized at Texas A&M University to test pressures up to 10, 000 psi. The design is primarily based on the current test vessel, strand burner II or SB-II and includes a cylindrical main body, two endcaps, and a bolt which is used to hold the test specimen. In addition to high-pressure testing, the new strand burner will be used to determine the temperature sensitivity of AP/HTPB-based solid propellants at high and low temperatures. For low-temperature tests, the strand burner will be placed horizontally into a freezer and cooled to - 65 ?F; whereas for the high-temperature tests, the strand burner will be heated to 194 ?F using resistance <b>heating</b> <b>tape</b> and mounted vertically. Two 80 % monomodal AP/HTPB composite baseline propellant formulations were used to verify the new strand burner?s design, one with an average AP particle size of 200 ?m and the other, 138 ?m.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to test the MoP {{catalysts}} which were made during autumn 2012, in a HDO reaction of phenol to benzene at a HDO rig. The catalysts were supported by Al 2 O 3, SiO 2, TiO 2 and ZrO 2, and they were prepared by impregnation, followed by calcination, reduction and passivation. New samples of the 2 catalysts which showed the highest activity, MoP/Al 2 O 3 and MoP/TiO 2, were prepared. They were characterized with N 2 -adsorption, chemisorption, TPR and XRD, and they were further tested at the HDO rig with varying temperature, flow rate, pressure and H 2 /oil ratio. The results from the N 2 -adsorption showed that the surface area of the supports decreased during impregnation, and increased slightly during reduction. The TPR analyses confirmed the 3 stage reduction of MoO 3 to MoP. The low calculated particle size from the chemisorption was confirmed by the XRD analyses, where no peaks indicating formation of MoP was found. The activity of the catalysts increased in the order: MoP/SiO 2 < MoP/ZrO 2 < MoP/Al 2 O 3 < MoP/TiO 2, which was the opposite trend of the metal dispersion. The activity of the MoP/TiO 2 catalyst decreased over time due to catalyst deactivation, and the activity varied not significantly with different pressure and H 2 /oil ratio. The high activation energy indicated that the rate determining step is the surface reaction. However, the varying results from the repeatability measurement of the MoP/TiO 2 catalyst showed that there are large uncertainties in the results. Small variations in the stirring and drying rate during catalyst preparation changed the catalyst properties significantly. Replacement of the thermocouple and <b>heating</b> <b>tape</b> may also have influenced the results. More research is therefore needed to verify the results. </p...|$|E

40|$|Core {{flooding}} is {{a commonly}} used experimental procedure in the petroleum industry. It involves pressurizing a reservoir rock and flowing fluid through {{it in the}} laboratory. The cylindrical rock, called a core, can be cut from the reservoir during a separate core drilling operation or a formation outcrop. A core flooding apparatus suitable for matrix acidizing was designed and assembled. Matrix acidizing is a stimulation technique in which hydrochloric acid (HCl) is injected down the wellbore below formation fracture pressure to dissolve carbonate (CaCO 3) rock creating high permeability streaks called wormholes. The main components of the apparatus include a continuous flow syringe pump, three core holders, a hydraulic hand pump, two accumulators, a back pressure regulator, and two pressure transducers connected {{through a series of}} tubing and valves. Due to the corrosive nature of the acid, the apparatus features Hastelloy which is a corrosion resistant metal alloy. Another substantial feature of the apparatus is the ability to apply 3000 psi back pressure. This is the pressure necessary to keep CO 2, a product of the CaCO 3 and HCl reaction, in solution at elevated temperatures. To perform experiments at temperature, the core holder is wrapped with <b>heating</b> <b>tape</b> and surrounded by insulation. Tubing is wrapped around a heating band with insulation to heat the fluid before it enters the core. A LabVIEW graphical programming code was written to control heaters as well as record temperature and pressure drop across the core. Other considerations for the design include minimizing footprint, operational ease by the user, vertical placement of the accumulators and core holders to minimize gravity effects, and air release valves. Core floods can be performed at varying injection rates, temperatures and pressures up to 5000 psi and 250 degF. The apparatus can handle small core plugs, 1 ?? diameter X 1 ?? length, up to 4 ?? X 20 ?? cores. The equipment description includes the purpose, relevant features, and connections to the system for each component.

Der Austreiber, der direkt in einen doppelt verglasten Flachkollektor integriert ist, stellt das zentrale Bauteil dieser Kältemaschine dar. Er ist gleichzeitig die Thermosiphonpumpe des Kälteprozesses. Üblicherweise wird diese im unteren Bereich des Rohres von Heizbändern mit einer hohen Wärmestromdichte beheizt. In einem kombinierten Kollektoraustreiber limitieren die Solarstrahlung und der Kollektorwirkungsgrad die {{maximale}} Wärmestromdichte. Zusätzlich muss die Thermosiphonpumpe aufgrund der Kollektorneigung entlang einer geneigten Ebene fördern. Diese Randbedingungen erfordern umfangreiche Untersuchungen zum Förderverhalten der Thermosiphonpumpe. Neben der Thermosiphonpumpe ist der Hilfsgaskreislauf, sowohl für die Kälteleistung als auch für den Wirkungsgrad des Diffusions-Absorptionskälteprozesses, von besonderer Bedeutung. Ein Schwerpunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit ist die detaillierte Untersuchung des Hilfsgaskreislaufs. Mittels Clamp-On-Ultraschallsensoren gelingt es erstmalig den Ammoniakmolanteil sowie den Gasvolumenstrom kontinuierlich und ohne Eingriffe in den Prozess zu erfassen. Ein magnetgekoppelter Edelstahlpropeller ermöglicht, statt der üblichen Naturzirkulation, eine Zwangsumwälzung des Hilfsgaskreislaufs. Somit kann der Einfluss der Strömungsgeschwindigkeit auf die Stoffübertragung im Absorber und Verdunster nachgewiesen und bewertet werden. Mit den Messergebnissen wird ein neu erstelltes Simulationsmodell, welches die Stoffübertragung im Hilfsgaskreislauf abbildet, validiert.

Durch einen anschließenden, erfolgreichen Test in einem Freiluftprüfstand wird die Funktionsfähigkeit des Anlagenkonzepts nachgewiesen. This work {{demonstrates that}} it is possible to operate a diffusion absorption chiller directly heated by a solar collector. The generator, as the main component of the chiller, is directly integrated into a double glazed flat plate collector. The generator also acts as the bubble pump of the refrigeration process. Normally the bubble pump is heated at the bottom of the tube by a <b>heating</b> <b>tape</b> with a high heat flux. In a combined generator/collector the maximum heat flux is limited by the solar radiation and the efficiency of the solar collector. Due to the inclination angle of the collector the bubble pump has to pump the solution upwards. These boundary conditions require extensive investigations of the performance of the bubble pump. In addition to the bubble pump the auxiliary gas circuit has a big influence on the coefficient of performance as well as the cooling capacity of the diffusion absorption chiller. A focus of this work is the detailed investigation of the auxiliary gas circuit. By means of clamp on ultrasonic detectors, it is possible for the first time to measure the ammonia molar fraction and the volume flow of the gas circuit continuously without influencing the process. A stainless steel propeller connected with a magnetic clutch offers measuring the influence of forced circulation of the auxiliary gas circuit instead of natural circulation. Thus, the influence of the flow rate on the mass transfer in the absorber and the evaporator can be demonstrated and evaluated. The measurement data are used to validate a new simulation model, which calculates the mass transfer in the auxiliary gas circuit. Based on the measurement results of the electrically heated chiller in the lab, the investigations of the bubble pump and the results of the generator/collector measured in the solar simulator, the solar heated diffusion absorption refrigeration system is designed and built up. Finally, the concept of a direct solar driven diffusion absorption chiller is demonstrated in an outdoor test facility...|$|E
