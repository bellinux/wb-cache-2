40|$|Abstract. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study heat transfer rate of impinging <b>flame</b> <b>jet</b> and cutting quality of steel plate using <b>flame</b> <b>jet.</b> The cutting torch was used for heating on the impingement surface, and it was used for cutting the steel plate samples. LPG at constant flow rate of 0. 14 kg/s was mixed with pure oxygen at varied flow rate corresponding to equivalence ratio, Φ = 0. 78, 0. 93 and 1. 16. The nozzle-to-plate distance was examined at h= 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 mm. Heat transfer rate on the impingement surface was measured using water cooled heat flux sensor. In order to investigate cutting quality, steel plate with 6 mm in thickness was cut <b>by</b> this <b>flame</b> <b>jet</b> with cutting speed at 260 mm/min. The surface roughness, slag quantity and kerf characteristics were considered for cutting quality. The results show that the <b>flame</b> <b>jet</b> for condition of Φ = 0. 78 at h= 4 mm gives the highest heat transfer rate. The <b>flame</b> <b>jet</b> for condition of Φ = 0. 93 at h= 6 mm is optimal for using cutting steel plate in this study...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} {{increase}} understanding of subsonic <b>jet</b> <b>ﬂame</b> blow-off phenomena, through experimental studies {{that include the}} controlled introduction of air into the fuel jet. As the molar concentration of air in the <b>jet</b> <b>ﬂame</b> gas, Aj, is increased the reaction zone becomes leaner, and the ﬂame lift-off distance increases. Eventually, ﬂame oscillations develop and are followed <b>by</b> <b>ﬂame</b> blow-off. A <b>jet</b> mixing analysis enables {{the extent of the}} leaning-off of the mixture to be estimated. From this, the reduced mean ﬂamelet burning velocity, ua, is found at the location of the pure fuel <b>jet</b> <b>ﬂame.</b> The conditions for blow-off are correlated with the last measured stable values of the dimensionless ﬂow number, Ub⁄, for methane and propane <b>jet</b> <b>ﬂames,</b> with and without added air. Values of Ub⁄ decline as the proportion of added air increases, more markedly so with methane. This is attributed to the leaning-off of the ﬂame, and the associated decrease in the ﬂame extinction stretch rate. As Ub⁄ declines in value, with increasing air dilution, the emissions of unburned hydrocarbons just prior to blow-off increase. An underlying generality of the ﬁndings is revealed when ua is introduced into the expression for Ub⁄, and Aj is normalised by the moles of air required to burn a mole of fuel...|$|R

40|$|The jet {{impingement}} heat transfer is a well-established technique for obtaining high heat transfer rates for many cooling and heating applications. Impingement heat transfer methods {{are widely used}} in domestic and industrial appliances. The impinging isothermal gas jets are used for both heating and cooling. However, premixed <b>flame</b> <b>jets</b> are used for heating the target surface. Present study {{is an attempt to}} compare the heat transfer characteristics of the isothermal air <b>jets</b> and premixed <b>flame</b> <b>jets.</b> The isothermal air jet having jet temperature of 30 degrees C (cold jet or ambient temperature jet), 100 degrees C (hot jet), and premixed methane air <b>flame</b> <b>jet</b> (stoichiometric mixture) with Reynolds numbers of 500, 750, 1000, 1250 and 1500 and nozzle or burner to plate spacings of 2 d, 4 d and 6 d are experimentally investigated for heat transfer characterisation.

For a fixed jet Reynolds number, the Nusselt number of isothermal air jet is found independent of the temperature difference between jet and surrounding fluid. A steady state technique is proposed for characterisation of premixed <b>flame</b> <b>jets.</b> The outcome of the present study reveals that the heat transfer characteristics of isothermal air jet and the premixed <b>flame</b> <b>jet</b> are almost same.

40|$|Thermal {{spallation}} of rock may {{be defined}} as a type of progressive rock failure caused by the creation of thermal stresses induced by a sudden application of heat from a high temperature source. This technology is applicable to only certain types of hard rock, such as dolomite, taconite, and granite. In 1981 and 1982, the deepest holes ever drilled by this process were drilled in granite to depths of 1086 feet and 425 feet respectively. Penetration rates {{at the bottom of the}} deeper hole reached a maximum of 100 ft/hr. Because of these high rates, considerable interest was generated concerning the use of this technology for the drilling of deep holes. Based on this interest, this study was undertaken to evaluate the technical and economic aspects of the technology in general. This methodology has been used for blasthole drilling, the cutting of chambers at the bottom of drilled holes, and the cutting of narrow grooves in rock. However, because of the very high temperatures generated <b>by</b> the <b>flame</b> <b>jet</b> and the application of the technology to only certain types of rock, other areas of use have been very limited. In this report, evaluation of the technology was performed by conceptually designing and costing a theoretical <b>flame</b> <b>jet</b> drilling rig. The design process reviews a number of different concepts of the various components needed, and then chooses those pieces of equipment that best suit the needs of the system and have the best chance of being properly developed. The final concept consists of a flexible umbilical hose containing several internal hoses for carrying the various required fluids. An evaluation of this system was then made to determine its operational characteristics. The drilling capabilities and the economics of this rig were then compared to a conventional rotary drilling rig by theoretically drilling two holes of approximately 15, 000 feet in depth. This comparison was done by use of a spread sheet type computer program. The results of this study indicate that <b>flame</b> <b>jet</b> drilling performs significantly better in both time and cost. These results are due primarily to the high penetration rates, the reduced number of trips, and the decreased trip time due to the use of the umbilical. However, this significant time and cost advantage must be tempered by the fact that they are based on the assumption that the main components of the <b>flame</b> <b>jet</b> rig can be realistically and reliably built. Unfortunately, the use of an umbilical system presents very realistic and difficult design problems as hole depth extends beyond 7000 feet. Thus, unless a significant market for the use of this equipment can be found, further development of an umbilical type system is very questionable. An alternate system suggests by LASL may circumvent many of the problems stated. This concept consists of using concentric pipes and a down hole fluid separation system. Concentric pipe built by the Walker-Neer Manufacturing Company, Wichita Falls, Texas, has been used successfully in the drilling industry for years. Fluid separators have also been developed and used. Although this concept also presents problems, it may be worth investigating...|$|R

Comparison of impinging annular jet and round <b>jet</b> <b>flames</b> under identical fuel/air flow rates shows that at low H, the annular <b>jet</b> <b>flame</b> has higher heat fluxes in the region near to the jet axis because a cool core {{is present in the}} round <b>jet</b> <b>flame.</b> Compared to the round <b>jet</b> <b>flame,</b> the annular <b>jet</b> <b>flame</b> achieves the highest heat transfer rate at smaller H and the maximum value is slightly lower, indicating that the annular <b>jet</b> <b>flame</b> is favorable for uniform heating.

40|$|Advanced {{particle}} diagnostic {{technology has}} been applied to establish process parameters to deposit high quality nickel based carbide cermet coatings for marine hydraulic applications. The cermet coatings are produced via the kerosene fuelled high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spray process, which uses a hypersonic <b>flame</b> <b>jet</b> to melt and accelerate feedstock particles onto the component surfaces. The traditional ‘trial and error’ procedure is not technically robust, as well as being costly and time consuming. Instead, a superior method is implemented in the current study that performs real time monitoring of the process parameters associated with the HVOF <b>flame</b> <b>jets.</b> Subsequently, coatings can be produced with the knowledge of the inflight particle size, temperature and velocity profiles. The analytical results allow identification of suitable coating process parameters, which translate to coatings of lower porosity and enhanced mechanical performance...|$|R
5000|$|In Spore Creatures {{there are}} a {{multitude}} of parts to collect. Certain parts grant the creature special abilities called [...] "bio-powers". However, these bio-powers induce several catches (i.e. stun causes poor eyesight). The bio-powers are: <b>Flame</b> <b>Jet,</b> Leaf Flurry, Quick Healing, Stun, and Force Field. <b>Flame</b> <b>Jet</b> and Leaf Flurry are both offensive bio-powers that damage enemies in combat; Stun momentarily paralyzes the enemy, disabling it from attacking; Quick Healing and Force Field are defensive bio-powers that heals the creature and its friends, and creates an invulnerable bubble around the player's creature, respectively.Some legs also grant terrain walking abilities. There are six types hazardous terrains: Poison, lava, thorny, icy, deep water and hot sand. There is no leg part that allows the creature to walk in poison, {{but there is a}} cheat available on the cheat menu that enables users this ability.|$|R

The <b>flame</b> <b>jet</b> kills the headcrab but also detonates a fuel canister, which creates a chain reaction.|$|R
