5000|$|On 30 November 2012, Nobel Peace Prize winners Desmond Tutu, Mairead Maguire and Adolfo Pérez Esquivel {{publicly}} {{opposed the}} awarding of the prize to the European Union. The 1984, 1976 and 1980 laureates stated in {{an open letter to}} the Nobel Foundation, based in Sweden, that in their view the EU stood for [...] "... security based on military force and waging wars rather than insisting on the need for an alternative approach" [...] and that [...] "... the Norwegian Nobel Committee has redefined and reshaped the prize {{in a way that is}} not in accordance with the law". The International Peace Bureau, which won the prize in 1910, and several peace activists, writers and lawyers also signed the letter. The signatories demanded that the Nobel <b>Foundation</b> <b>stop</b> the payment of the SEK 8 million prize money.|$|E
50|$|From 1998 to October 2005 Van Heijningen was {{coordinator}} of the XminY Solidarity Fund.

He was joint initiator of ATTAC Nederland, which was for several years an active participant in the movement against neoliberal globalisation. It was during this period that he joined the SP, standing as the 13th placed candidate on the party’s list for the parliamentary elections of 2003. Following a disappointing result which saw him fail to be elected, Van Heijningen joined the SP’s parliamentary staff as an advisor on foreign policy. In his capacity as founder of the Comité Grondwet Nee (Committee for a No to the Constitution), in the referendum of 2005 he {{played a significant role in}} the successful campaign against the European Constitution.

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the National Science <b>Foundation</b> <b>stopped</b> {{supporting}} his research, calling the outcome [...] "routine". Despite {{this lack of}} interest, the Foundation used Keeling's research in its warning in 1963 of rapidly increasing amounts of heat-trapping gases. A 1965 report from President Johnson's Science Advisory Committee similarly warned {{of the dangers of}} extra heat-trapping gases, which cause the temperature of the Earth to rise.|$|R

40|$|An advanced-level {{treatment}} of the basics of set theory, this text offers students a firm <b>foundation,</b> <b>stopping</b> {{just short of the}} areas employing model-theoretic methods. Geared toward upper-level undergraduate and graduate students, it consists of two parts: the first covers pure set theory, including the basic motions, order and well-foundedness, cardinal numbers, the ordinals, and the axiom of choice and some of it consequences; the second deals with applications and advanced topics such as point set topology, real spaces, Boolean algebras, and infinite combinatorics and large cardinals.

50|$|Like other provinces, Santa Fe Province {{incurred}} {{a significant}} fiscal deficit in 2011, {{which was an}} election year. In May 2012 the new governor, Antonio Bonfatti, announced that although the legal blocks for the Puerto de la Música had been lifted, the project {{would have to wait}} until the provincial finances improved and there was no fixed schedule for the beginning of the works. Soon after, the Puerto de la Música <b>Foundation</b> <b>stopped</b> soliciting donations for the project, citing the uncertainty about the date and the effect of inflation as reasons.|$|R
50|$|The American Theater Organ Society (ATOS) {{has been}} {{instrumental}} in programs to preserve the instruments originally installed in theatres for accompaniment of silent movies. In addition to local chapter events they hold an annual convention each year, highlighting performers and instruments in a specific locale. These instruments feature the Tibia pipe family as their <b>foundation</b> <b>stops</b> and regular use of tremulants. They were usually equipped with mechanical percussion accessories, pianos, and other imitative sounds useful in creating movie sound accompaniments such as auto horns, doorbells, and bird whistles.|$|R
50|$|In February 2012 the Susan G. Komen <b>Foundation</b> {{decided to}} <b>stop</b> funding {{for breast cancer}} {{screenings}} at Planned Parenthood. UltraViolet, which {{had been scheduled to}} debut in the summer, spearheaded a campaign against Komen with the assistance of MoveOn.org and CREDO SuperPac. They collected nearly one million signatures on a petition that was delivered to the foundation. The foundation reversed its decision and reinstated Planned Parenthood's funding within a week of receiving the petition.My understanding is that Susan G. Komen <b>Foundation</b> <b>stopped</b> funding Planned Parenthood because Planned Parenthood performed abortions, not for breast cancer screenings, but was pressured into resuming funding because of UltraViolet's misinformation.Following their victory, UltraViolet campaigned for the resignation of Karen Handel, the Komen Foundation vice president that orchestrated the effort to defund Planned Parenthood. Handel resigned shortly after.|$|R

50|$|It was Doğançay’s plan {{to commit}} a {{considerable}} amount of time and energy to provide a home that would showcase a mini-retrospective, spanning over five decades of his prolific and rich artistic production. Even the elevator car provides exhibition space for a small display of photographs from photographic “The Ironworkers Project”. Since 2010, the Doğançay Museum has been operated {{under the auspices of the}} Burhan-Angela Doğançay Foundation for Art and Culture. When Burhan Dogancay died in 2013, the <b>foundation</b> <b>stopped</b> collecting his works of art and began to concentrate on presenting what it already owned. Far beyond its material worth, the true value of the museum and its collection lies in the pleasure and passion for art it ignited in thousands of visitors from all over the world. A full-time director takes care of its day-to-day business, educational programs and special events. Upon entering the museum, visitors are amazed how one instantly leaves behind the hustle and bustle of the city.|$|R

50|$|Additional {{financial}} support for NMC resulted after the 1993 Copyright Duration Directive (93/98/EEC), which extended the copyright term from 50 to 70 years. As a result, the music of Gustav Holst came back into copyright, and NMC obtained increased funding. However, it has fallen out of copyright again, and the Holst <b>Foundation</b> will <b>stop</b> its activities in 2015, leaving NMC with a significant gap in funding.|$|R

This {{was in response to}} a 3% reduction in activity commissioned by NHS Dorset.|$|R
5000|$|The organ {{has some}} special characteristics: the {{principal}} pipes have generally a narrow scaling, which {{gives them a}} restrained dry tone. It has long been puzzling as to why Gabler found it acceptable to scale the pipes considerably narrower than could have been with such a great space to be filled. At times {{it was thought that}} Gabler was actually inept as an organ builder as the design had been called into question in his own lifetime, whereas his skills as a carpenter are unanimously considered superior ("... in which he is a paragon master ..."). Today, by contrast, it is assumed that Gabler's designs often favored aesthetics, while scaling of the ranks, he had wanted a more subdued, intimate and gentle sound. In order to give the organ a certain sonorous power and wealth despite the close scaling, Gabler populated the organ with many multi-rank voices, even in the <b>foundation</b> <b>stops.</b> In this way the multi-rank registers (as mixtures) received an unusually high number of pipes. Nevertheless, the organ known for its mild, chamber musical sound that maintains in its fullness a certain introversion.|$|R
50|$|As {{many people}} started to visit the new racetrack, the Hipic Society saw itself obligated to create a Railway stop on the current Roca Railway (Ferrocarril General Roca); the <b>stop's</b> <b>{{foundation}}</b> date is also used as the foundation date of the city: August 10, 1910.|$|R
5000|$|As Yorba <b>Foundation</b> had <b>stopped</b> its {{activities}} and GNOME had not revealed its plans about this project at that time, {{the future of}} Geary was unclear. As a result, to these incertitudes and due to previous design disagreements with the old Geary team and because elementary OS was actually using Geary as the default mail client but as a version heavily patched, Daniel Foré, the leader of Elementary OS, decided to fork the project on [...] and continue with the development; the project was renamed Pantheon Mail during the process. Pantheon Mail replaced Geary in elementary OS 0.4, which is codenamed Loki.|$|R

5000|$|Following Fahrenthold's reporting, the New York {{attorney}} general opened {{an inquiry into}} Trump Foundation fundraising practices, and ultimately issued a [...] "notice of violation" [...] ordering the <b>foundation</b> to <b>stop</b> raising money in New York. The Poynter Institute described Fahrenthold as [...] "one of the journalism stars of the 2016 campaign due to a string of revelations about Donald Trump's charitable giving (or lack of same)". CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter said: [...] "Some have dubbed work Pulitzer worthy. Its impact was reinforced on Tuesday 13, 2016 when President Obama cited the reporting while stumping for Hillary Clinton."

50|$|Kitt Peak was {{selected}} by its first director, Aden B. Meinel, in 1958 as the site for a national observatory under contract with the National Science Foundation (NSF) and was administered by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy. The land was leased from the Tohono O'odham under a perpetual agreement. The second director (1960 to 1971) was Nicholas U. Mayall. In 1982 NOAO was formed to consolidate the management of three optical observatories — Kitt Peak; the National Solar Observatory facilities at Kitt Peak and Sacramento Peak, New Mexico; and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. The observatory sites are under lease from the Tohono O'odham Nation {{at the amount of}} a quarter dollar per acre yearly, which was overwhelmingly approved by the Council in the 1950s.
