40|$|International audienceThe {{prediction}} of the parameters characterising the negative lightning discharge {{and the return}} stroke {{is of a great}} interest for the protection of populations and structures in temperate regions where most cloud to ground lightning discharges (80 to 90 % of lightning shots) are of negative polarity. Disposing of a model enabling to predict the impact points and the distance of striking down by lightning should permit to prevent the dangerous effects on engineering systems. Contrary to the positive lightning for which many theoretical models are available, researches to derive models for the negative lightning are still at their earlier stages, due to the complexity of the mechanisms involved in the negative lightning propagation process. This contribution is in the continuity of our previous work related to the positive long <b>discharge</b> <b>in</b> <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> and positive lightning. A self-consistent dynamic model of negative lightning discharge taking into account the different phases of the propagation (i. e., the initiation of the first corona, the negative and space leaders and the junction of leaders) and return stroke is presented. This model uses LCR line electrical network parameters derived from electromagnetic field, physical laws and gas discharge theories. It enables to determine the main macroscopic parameters of the negative discharge (current and corresponding charge, propagation velocities, potential drop along its channel, power and energy injected into the gap and a trajectory of the <b>discharge</b> plotted <b>in</b> 3 D in real time obtained from a probabilistic distribution) and the associated return stroke (current and charge, velocity [...] .).

40|$|It {{is shown}} that ac {{discharges}} propagating at an air / dielectric interface, though of planar structure, behave, till a critical voltage Vcrit, as corona <b>discharges</b> <b>in</b> an <b>air</b> <b>gap,</b> with similar propagation fields for the filamentary discharge components and similar glow components. This leads {{to consider the}} surface discharges as gas discharges propagating above the dielectric surface. Beyond Vcrit, the retention of charges by the dielectric surface becomes ineffective, due to the gas heating in the filamentary channels and to the heat subsequently transferred from these channels to the surface. In return, the surface gives its energy excess back to the discharge, so opening the way, on the surface, to leader-like discharges of higher conductivity, needing about 10 times lower fields to propagate.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{simulations of}} an atmospheric pressure <b>air</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>in</b> a point-to-plane geometry with a dielectric layer {{parallel to the}} cathode plane. Experimentally, a <b>discharge</b> reignition <b>in</b> the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> below the dielectrics has been observed. With a 2 D fluid model, it is shown that due to the fast rise of the high voltage applied and the sharp point used, a first positive spherical discharge forms around the point. Then this discharge propagates axially and impacts the dielectrics. As the first discharge starts spreading on the upper dielectric surface, <b>in</b> the second <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> with a low preionization density of 10 ^ 4 ^- 3, the 2 D fluid model predicts a rapid reignition of a positive <b>discharge.</b> As <b>in</b> experiments, the <b>discharge</b> reignition is much slower, a discussion on physical processes {{to be considered in}} the model to increase the reignition delay is presented. The limit case with no initial seed charges <b>in</b> the second <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> has been studied. First, we have calculated the time to release an electron from the cathode surface by thermionic and field emission processes for a work function φ ∈ ≤ft[3, 4] eV and an amplification factor β ∈ ≤ft[100, 220]. Then a 3 D Monte Carlo model has been used to follow the dynamics of formation of an avalanche starting from a single electron emitted at the cathode. Due to the high electric field <b>in</b> the second <b>air</b> <b>gap,</b> we have shown that in a few nanoseconds, a Gaussian cloud of seed charges is formed at a small distance from the cathode plane.

40|$|Abstract – The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the discharge phenomenon for a point-plane air in-terval using an original fuzzy logic system. Firstly, a physical model based on streamer theory with consideration of the space charge fields due to electrons and positive ions is proposed. To test this model we have calculated the breakdown threshold voltage for a point-plane air interval. The same model is used to determine the discharge steps for different configurations as an inference data base. Secondly, using results obtained by the numerical simulation of the previous model, we have intro-duced the fuzzy logic technique to predict the breakdown threshold voltage of the same configurations used in the numerical model and make estimation on the insulating state of the air interval. From the comparison of obtained results, we can conclude that they are in accordance with the experimental ones obtained for breakdown <b>discharges</b> <b>in</b> different point-plane <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> collected from the literature. The proposed study using fuzzy logic technique shows a good performance in the analysis of different discharge steps of the air interval...|$|R

The non-equilibrium state of plasma is maintained by using a cathode with a weakly conducting liquid like tap water. The anode is formed with a cooled metal ring-shaped inserted in a dielectric barrel. This assembly is fixed at ~ 1 cm above the water surface. The velocity of the air flow through the anode hole may be changed from 0 m/s up to ~ 10 m/s.

Five coupled two-dimensional transient partial differential equations describing the <b>discharge</b> evolution <b>in</b> the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> have been solved using a finite difference algorithm developed earlier. Temporal development of the charged particle number densities, electrostatic potential, electric field, and current at both the electrodes is presented when the wire is negatively biased at 2500 V. The impact of negative ions on gap breakdown has been assessed by comparing the results of analyses with and without negative ions. It is concluded that the negative ions have negligible effect during {{the early stages of the}} discharge development. However, as the discharge evolves, the negative ions cause a net loss of electrons from the discharge. The effect is most pronounced away from the discharge axis, where peaks in the electron density occur as breakdown proceeds. Radial spread of discharge and current growth rate are relatively unaffected by the presence of negative ions, but the magnitude of total current at the electrodes has been found to decrease by a decade when the negative ions are present...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} {{research on the}} numerical modelling of electrical <b>discharges</b> <b>in</b> laboratory long <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> excited with positive switching impulses. It begins with the preliminary work of several scientists during the last decades, making {{a detailed analysis of}} different approaches for modelling all the stages <b>in</b> a full <b>discharge.</b> The relations between these models are identified as well as the effect on the outcome when modifying some important input parameters. The general concept describing the discharge phenomenon usually includes three main elements: the streamer inception, the streamer-to-leader transition and the stable leader propagation. These elements are present in many of the analysed models and the main differences between them are the assumptions and simplifications made by each author at a specific point in their methodologies. The models are usually simplified by assigning experimentally determined values to physical constants pertinent to different stages of the full discharge. These constants are the potential gradient in the leader-corona region to sustain the leader propagation, the charge per unit length along the leader channel which depends on the atmospheric conditions and the voltage impulse wave shape; and the leader propagation velocity, which is closely related to the discharge current. The dissertation includes the results of laboratory work related the study of leaders <b>in</b> long gap <b>discharges,</b> electrical parameters and optical records. By reconstructing the three-dimensional leader propagation for the rod-to-plane configuration, it was possible to study the random tortuous path followed by the leader as it propagates. One important element included <b>in</b> the <b>discharge</b> modelling is the representation of the leader-corona region in front of the leader tip as it propagates towards the grounded electrode. For the calculation of the net charge available in the leader-corona region, two new methodologies were pro-posed based on the electrostatic potential distribution obtained from a finite element method solver. This allowed the inclusion of more elements representing different parts of the <b>discharge</b> <b>in</b> the simulation domain. In the final part, all the analysed elements and the new proposed ones were included in a new methodology for the modelling of electrical dis-charges <b>in</b> long <b>air</b> laboratory <b>gaps.</b> The results obtained from this methodology were compared to experimental data.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the novel idea of {{controlling}} the electric stress or field distribution <b>in</b> a hybrid <b>air</b> - solid-dielectric high voltage insulation by promoting accumulation of surface charges on the internal interfacial layers in the combined (hybrid) dielectric structure. Primarily, applications {{are expected to be}} found in high voltage dc systems and as a method to improve the resistance against insulation failure by overvoltages, e. g. lightning or switching surges. The unexploited concept introduced in this report is {{based on the fact that}} the insulation ability of an air-insulated high voltage system can be increased if the metal conductors are covered with dielectric coatings. The origin is a conditioning effect due to accumulation of charges on the coatings that significantly alters the internal electric stress distribution. A part of the electric stress across the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> is transferred to and absorbed in the (thick) solid coatings. The outcome is an increase in the integrated breakdown strength of the hybrid system, which authorizes a further extended loading of it. The system conditioning is primarily accomplished by allowing a strictly limited <b>discharge</b> activity <b>in</b> the <b>air</b> <b>gap.</b> The charge formation and its effect on insulation ability of the hybrid insulation was experimentally investigated and also analysed in terms of electrostatic field models and (quasi) two- and three-dimensional numerical discharge computations. The analysed arrangement consisted of two flat dielectric-coated metal electrodes and was separated by an adjustable <b>air</b> <b>gap.</b> The received improvements in insulation ability during dc and impulse voltage applications were substantial and remarkable. Compared to the equivalent bare (uncoated) electrode system, the measured boost in dielectric performance was, for different <b>air</b> <b>gaps,</b> larger than between 40 % and 130 % for positive dc stress and larger than between 50 % and 220 % and positive impulse stress. Correspondingly, a significant transfer of the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> electric stress was also recognized. Juxtaposed to the pure capacitive electric field distribution, electric stress transfers of up to at least 70 % for positive dc (92 kV, <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> 6 mm) and 95 % for positive impulse (52 kV, <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> 6 mm) load were established. <b>Air</b> <b>gap</b> stress off-loads of roughly the same magnitudes were obtained <b>in</b> the numerical <b>discharge</b> analyses. Thus, the predicted redistribution of the internal electric stress was effectively demonstrated by both experimental and computational means. Several dynamic features of the charge conditioning process were identified. It was e. g. recognized that the insulation concept presents an adaptive property of adjusting the insulation level to the encountered <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> electric stress...|$|R
