It debuted at number four on the UK Albums Chart after a band-led campaign to get the album to number one, and appeared on several album-of-the-year lists.

5|$|Construction of I-380 took 12 {{years to}} complete, ending in 1985. After the interstate opened, US218 was moved onto the new freeway. In the 1990s, the I-380 {{corridor}} {{was selected as}} part of the Avenue of the Saints corridor, which Iowa designated as Iowa Highway 27 in 2001. I-380 has been affected by two major floods, the Great <b>Flood</b> <b>of</b> 1993 and the Iowa <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> 2008, both of which closed the road at the Iowa River for two weeks.|$|E

40|$|Ljubljansko barje is {{the largest}} {{floodplain}} in Slovenia. Heavy rainfall in predominantly karst catchment area of Ljubljanica river instigate <b>flooding</b> <b>of</b> Ljubljansko barje, caused by river Ljubljanica and its torrential tributaries such as Iška at the south side and Gradaščica at {{the north side of}} Ljubljansko barje. On the one hand, <b>flooding</b> <b>of</b> Ljubljansko barje is beneficial to the city of Ljubljana as it lowers the risk <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> in the city, while on the other hand, it poses danger to the inhabitants of settlements of Ljubljansko barje. This thesis analyses hydrology <b>of</b> the largest <b>floods</b> <b>of</b> Ljubljansko barje {{since the beginning of the}} 20 th century, such as floods in 1926, 1933 and 2010. Analysis results indicate that <b>flooding</b> <b>of</b> Ljubljansko barje occurs in combination with highintensity precipitation that lasts for couple <b>of</b> days. <b>Flooding</b> <b>of</b> this area can also occur after longer periods of lower-intensity precipitation followed by precipitation of higher intensity due to lower water retention capability of catchment area <b>of</b> Ljubljanica. <b>Flooding</b> <b>of</b> river Ljubljanica on Ljubljansko barje initiate gradually and last for several days or even few weeks. On the contrary, flash <b>floods</b> are characteristic <b>of</b> torrential tributaries Gradaščica and Iška. Main causes <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> <b>of</b> Ljubljansko barje are quantity and duration of precipitation and high antecedent precipitation index. Results show that floodings of Ljubljansko barje usually occur in autumn. Trends in seasonal precipitation and continuous settlement of the ground of Ljubljansko barje indicate severer effects <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> in this area in the future...|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of the North Pine Dam and the <b>flooding</b> <b>of</b> Lake Samsonvale in the 1970s caused a series of forced resumptions of family farms. The <b>flooding</b> <b>of</b> the Lake also closed the Presbyterian Church, community hall, and post office.|$|R
5|$|Behind the sea wall, {{the marshes}} were drained after the war, and reverted to farmland, but {{the bank was}} {{breached}} in the North Sea <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> 1953, returning the whole area to tidal saltmarsh dominated by sea aster. The {{construction of a new}} sea wall across the reserve created a shallow freshwater lagoon, with a reed bed on its northern side and a vegetation-free brackish marsh.|$|E
5|$|Big Wapwallopen Creek {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{flooding}} in Rice Township and Wright Township. It is also a primary flooding source in Conyngham Township, Dorrance Township, Fairview Township, Hollenback Township, and Nescopeck Township. However, in Conyngham Township, a 100 year <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> the creek would only inundate a small and undeveloped area.|$|E
5|$|CCC Camp S-95, {{which opened}} on May 29, 1933 {{on the site}} of an old lumber camp, was able to {{distinguish}} itself over the years it operated in Sullivan County. Two floods swept through the area in 1933 and 1936. The August <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> 1933 caused extensive damage and largely destroyed the newly built camp. During the course of the flooding two young men from Camp S-95 saved the lives of two drowning children at Worlds End State Park. The <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> 1936 covered a large area within the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. The young men of the CCC camp were among the leaders in the cleaning up after the flood and rebuilding many destroyed bridges and roads. In 1936 the park was officially expanded beyond the original small picnic area. Camp S-95 closed in 1941.|$|E
50|$|With {{the regular}} <b>flooding</b> <b>of</b> {{settlements}} in the UK, a rethink on flood risk management was initiated. One of the proposals put forward was containing flood waters at source to prevent large volumes of water flowing downstream causing soil erosion and <b>flooding</b> <b>of</b> properties.|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamentals}} <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> danger formulation is defining space classification <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> characteristics, e. g. overflow {{borders and}} water depths in flood plains and subsequent {{analysis of these}} data {{in the form of}} so called maps <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> danger. The diploma thesis deals with characteristics of a selected part of Smědá river and with simulation <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> flows in order to create a map <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> risks which could be used as a possible design <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> precautions and protection of urban areas. The thesis is divided into two parts. The first part explains the terms <b>of</b> <b>flood,</b> types <b>of</b> <b>floods,</b> objects on the flow, degrees <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> activity, management <b>of</b> protection against <b>floods</b> in the Czech Republic, types <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> precautions, outline <b>of</b> models of flows in open watercourses and metodology <b>of</b> preparation <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> maps. The second part concerns the mentioned river. After a brief introduction of the river, the paper gives a detailed description of water management buildings and respective simulation <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> flows and flood lines in the area concerned...|$|R

5|$|Little Wapwallopen Creek {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{flooding}} in Conyngham Township, along with the Susquehanna River. The creek is also the main source of flooding in Dorrance Township and one of the main sources in Rice Township. A 100 year <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> the creek would flood substantial areas. Such flooding would also be exacerbated by backwater flooding from the Susquehanna River.|$|E

5|$|One such {{community}} was Linn City (originally named Robin’s Nest). Settled in 1843 by Robert Moore, Robert himself built four flour and lumber mills {{along the banks}} of the Willamette. Warehouses, homes, and mills were steadily added until 1861, when a fire destroyed several of the buildings. Efforts at rebuilding the small town entirely ceased when the Great <b>Flood</b> <b>of</b> 1862 struck, wiping out the remaining buildings.|$|E

5|$|A {{prophylactic}} method introduced {{after the}} North Sea <b>Flood</b> <b>of</b> 1953 is {{the construction of}} dams and storm-surge barriers (flood barriers). They are open and allow free passage, but close when the land is under threat of a storm surge. Major storm surge barriers are the Oosterscheldekering and Maeslantkering in the Netherlands, which {{are part of the}} Delta Works project; the Thames Barrier protecting London; and the Saint Petersburg Dam in Russia.|$|E
