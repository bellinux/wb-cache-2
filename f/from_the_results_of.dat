25|$|The role of OSM as an {{inflammatory}} mediator was clear {{as early as}} 1986. Its precise effect on the immune system, as with any cytokine, is far from clear.

It {{is important to note}} that before 1997 differences in human and murine OSM receptor usage were unknown.

25|$|The first {{published}} causal {{explanation of the}} motions of planets was Johannes Kepler's Astronomia nova published in 1609. He concluded, based on Tycho Brahe's observations of the orbit of Mars, that the orbits were ellipses. This break with ancient thought was happening {{around the same time}} that Galileo was proposing abstract mathematical laws for the motion of objects. He may (or may not) have performed the famous experiment of dropping two cannonballs of different weights from the tower of Pisa, showing that they both hit the ground at the same time. The reality of this experiment is disputed, but, more importantly, he did carry out quantitative experiments by rolling balls on an inclined plane.

The degree to which this dissociation occurred depended above all {{on the nature of}} the substance and its concentration in the solution, being more developed the greater the dilution. The ions were supposed to be the carriers of not only the electric current, as in electrolysis, but also of the chemical activity. The relation between the actual number of ions and their number at great dilution (when all the molecules were dissociated) gave a quantity of special interest ("activity constant").|$|E
