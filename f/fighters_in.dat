5|$|At these speeds, it was {{expected}} that the B-70 would be almost immune to interceptor aircraft, the only effective weapon against bomber aircraft at the time. The bomber would spend only a few minutes over a particular radar station, flying out of its range before the controllers could position their <b>fighters</b> <b>in</b> a suitable location for an interception. High speed also made the aircraft difficult to see on radar displays and its high-altitude flight could not be matched by any contemporary Soviet fighter.|$|E
5|$|During his reign, Hughes {{was widely}} {{considered}} the #1 pound-for-pound mixed martial {{artist in the}} world. Hughes was also regarded by many analysts and several media outlets {{as one of the}} greatest welterweight fighters of all time, as well {{as one of the greatest}} pound-for-pound <b>fighters</b> <b>in</b> the sport's history.|$|E
5|$|Generally for {{usage of}} 12-6 elbows, {{the fight is}} stopped and fighters are given a warning. However, there have been {{occasions}} where points have been deducted or the fighter using that strike in competition has been disqualified due to the move incapacitating <b>fighters.</b> <b>In</b> 2009, Matt Hamill defeated Jon Jones by disqualification due to Jones using 12-6 elbows. Hamill {{said that he was}} unable to defend against the elbows.|$|E

5|$|In the end, {{despite all}} the efforts, most Home Army forces had {{inadequate}} weaponry. In 1944, when the Home Army was at its peak strength (200,000–600,000, according to various estimates), the Home Army had enough weaponry for only some 32,000 soldiers. On 1 August 1944, when the Warsaw Uprising began, only a sixth of Home Army <b>fighters</b> <b>in</b> Warsaw were armed.|$|E
5|$|Initially given a blue color scheme, the TIE fighter {{models for}} the first film were grey to better film against a bluescreen; TIE <b>fighters</b> <b>in</b> The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) shifted {{back to being a}} muted blue. Sound {{designer}} Ben Burtt created the distinctive TIE fighter sound effect by combining an elephant call with a car driving on wet pavement. Combat scenes between TIE fighters and the Millennium Falcon and Rebel Alliance X-wing <b>fighters</b> <b>in</b> Star Wars were meant to be reminiscent of World War II dogfight footage; editors used World War II air combat clips as placeholders while Industrial Light & Magic completed the movie's special effects. Darth Vader's distinct TIE advanced X1 in Star Wars was designed to make it instantly recognizable, and the TIE interceptors developed for Jedi were designed to look fast, deadly, and frightening.|$|E

5|$|On 2 December 1943, {{orders for}} 100 {{production}} FR-1s were placed, with a follow-up order of 1,000 additional <b>fighters</b> <b>in</b> January 1945.

Only 66 Fireballs were completed by November 1945 as orders for 1,044 FR-1s were canceled on VJ Day.|$|E
5|$|Saville succeeded Claire L. Chennault as America's leading fighter {{aircraft}} tactician. With Benjamin S. Kelsey, Saville co-wrote {{the technical}} specifications {{which led to}} the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and the Bell P-39 Airacobra <b>fighters.</b> <b>In</b> 1949 he selected the North American F-86 Sabre as America's main defense fighter, and in 1950 he approved a guided air-to-air missile system that would be carried aboard the proposed supersonic 1954 interceptor; the missile produced was the AIM-4 Falcon.|$|E
5|$|The British {{correctly}} {{estimated the}} German strength as 250 aircraft. To meet the threat the Fighter Controllers at 11 Group's Uxbridge centre scrambled 13 Squadrons; No. 12 Group at Watnall passed on ordered to four more. Soon, a combined total of 47 Spitfires and 97 Hurricanes {{were in the}} air. Ten of the RAF <b>fighters</b> <b>in</b> the air (nine Spitfires from No. 19 Squadron and one Hurricane from No. 151 Squadron) were armed with 20mm cannon.|$|E

5|$|The E-1s {{came off}} the {{production}} line in February 1938, {{in time for a}} number of these aircraft to serve in the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War in March 1938. The RLM thought that because the E variant could outrun enemy <b>fighters</b> <b>in</b> Spain, {{there was no need to}} upgrade the defensive weaponry, which would prove to be a mistake in later years.|$|E
5|$|The four F-80 {{aircraft}} {{were able}} to attack the North Koreans from a greater distance. With a minimal amount of maneuvering, the US aircraft rushed the North Korean formation and quickly shot four of them down; two by Lieutenant Robert E. Wayne, one by Lieutenant Robert H. Dewald, and one by Schillereff. These victories were the first for US Air Force jet-powered <b>fighters</b> <b>in</b> history.|$|E
5|$|Almost every fighter {{project in}} the postwar era {{immediately}} applied the concept, which started appearing on production <b>fighters</b> <b>in</b> the late 1940s. Avro engineers explored swept-wing and tail modifications to the CF-100 known as the CF-103, which had proceeded to wooden mock-up stage. The CF-103 offered improved transonic performance with supersonic abilities in a dive. However, the basic CF-100 continued to improve through this period, and the advantages were continually eroded. When a CF-100 broke the sound barrier on 18 December 1952, interest in the CF-103 waned.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in July 1943, No. 450 Squadron {{took part}} in the Allied {{invasion}} of Sicily and the Italian campaign, primarily in the close support role. Its aircraft attacked targets in Yugoslavia as well as in Sicily and Italy. The squadron began converting from Kittyhawks to North American P-51 Mustang <b>fighters</b> <b>in</b> May 1945, but never saw action with its new aircraft. It was disbanded in August 1945 following the conclusion of hostilities, having suffered 63 fatal casualties during the war. Today, by agreement with the RAAF, the squadron's number is carried by a Royal Canadian Air Force unit, 450 Tactical Helicopter Squadron.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1943, {{following}} {{the capture of}} southern Italy, Allied aircraft started to appear over the Balkans. NDH military command was aware of this danger {{and was trying to}} persuade the Germans to provide at least two squadrons of Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters to the ZNDH. However, instead of Bf 109s, the only reinforcement fighters that came from Germany were the first of a batch of 36 overhauled captured French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 <b>fighters</b> <b>in</b> October, plus another dozen which arrived in December. The Germans also supplied 25 Beneš-Mráz Beta-Minor sporting two seater monoplanes, which were dispatched between the squadrons for liaison duty, as the lack of radio communications equipment at squadron level was still evident.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of Japanese air {{opposition}} to the American bomber raids, VIIFighter Command was solely tasked with ground attack missions from July. These raids were frequently made against airfields to destroy aircraft being held in reserve to attack the expected Allied invasion fleet. While the P-51 pilots only occasionally encountered Japanese <b>fighters</b> <b>in</b> the air, the airfields were protected by anti-aircraft batteries and barrage balloons. By the end of the war, VIIFighter Command had conducted 51 ground attack raids, of which 41 were considered successful. The fighter pilots claimed to have destroyed or damaged 1,062 aircraft and 254 ships along with large numbers of buildings and railway rolling stock. American losses were 91 pilots killed and 157 Mustangs destroyed.|$|E
