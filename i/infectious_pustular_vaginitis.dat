40|$|By using a {{monoclonal}} antibody directed against an epitope located on glycoprotein B of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV 1), a simple, convenient blocking {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) which combines a high sensitivity with a low false-positive rate has been developed. The test can be performed at low variance on undiluted bovine serum samples. The epitope on glycoprotein B appears to be conserved, because it could be detected by immunostaining in all of 160 BHV 1 isolates originating from 10 countries. In testing 215 anti-BHV 1 antibody-negative and 179 anti-BHV 1 antibody-positive serum samples, specificity and sensitivity were 0. 96 and 0. 99, respectively. This blocking ELISA is superior to a commercially available indirect ELISA and to the 24 -h virus neutralization test in detecting low antibody levels in serum. In addition, this blocking ELISA is able to detect specific antibodies in serum as early as 7 days postinfection. To minimize any risk of introducing latent BHV 1 carriers among noninfected cattle, this blocking ELISA would be, in our opinion, the test of choice.

Bovine herpesvirus 1 causes infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and <b>infectious</b> <b>pustular</b> vulvovaginitis in cattle, as well as abortion and weak calves. Serological evidence of alphaherpesvirus infection has been reported for wild and semidomesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Norway. To address the possibility that reindeer alphaherpesvirus (cervid herpesvirus 2 [CvHV- 2]) infection might affect the respiratory system and in part explain the relatively high mortality of reindeer calves during their first year, tissue samples were obtained from reindeer and reindeer fetuses at slaughterhouses in Finnmark County, Norway. A nested pan-alphaherpesvirus PCR amplification targeting the highly conserved UL 27 gene (encoding glycoprotein B) was used. Sequencing of amplicons revealed the presence of CvHV- 2 DNA. The detection of CvHV- 2 DNA in trigeminal ganglia (27 of 143 samples), nasal swabs (5 of 75 samples), and fetal tissues (12 of 48 samples) indicates that CvHV- 2 infection is endemic in this reindeer population.

40|$|Abstract In general, {{members of}} the Alphaherpesvirinae use the {{epithelium}} of the upper respiratory and/or genital tract as a preferential site for primary replication. Bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV- 1) may replicate at both sites and cause two major clinical entities designated as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and <b>infectious</b> <b>pustular</b> vulvovaginitis/balanoposthitis (IPV/IPB) in cattle. It has been hypothesized that subtype 1. 1 invades preferentially the upper respiratory mucosa whereas subtype 1. 2 favors replication at the peripheral genital tract. However, some studies are in contrast with this hypothesis. A thorough study of primary replication at both mucosae could elucidate whether or not different BoHV- 1 subtypes show differences in mucosa tropism. We established bovine respiratory and genital organ cultures with emphasis on maintenance of tissue morphology and viability during in vitro culture. In a next step, bovine respiratory and genital mucosa explants of the same animals were inoculated with several BoHV- 1 subtypes. A quantitative analysis of viral invasion in the mucosa was performed at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h post inoculation (pi) by measuring plaque latitude and penetration depth underneath the basement membrane. All BoHV- 1 subtypes exhibited a more profound invasion capacity in respiratory tissue compared to that in genital tissue at 24 h pi.

BoHV- 1 may replicate at both sites and causes two major clinical entities designated infectious bovine rhinotracheïtis (IBR) and <b>infectious</b> <b>pustular</b> vulvovaginitis/balanoposthitis (IPV/IPB) in cattle. It has been hypothesized that subtype 1. 1 invades preferentially the upper respiratory mucosa where subtype 1. 2 favors replication at the peripheral genital tract. However, some in vivo data are in contrast with that hypothesis. A thorough study of primary replication at both mucosae could elucidate this question. In the present study, we established a bovine respiratory and genital organ culture. Bovine respiratory and genital mucosal explants of the same animal were inoculated with several BoHV- 1 subtypes. A quantitative analysis of viral mucosal invasion was performed at 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours post inoculation (pi) by measuring plaque latitude and penetration depth underneath the basement membrane (BM). BoHV- 1 spreads plaquewise in the epithelium and penetrates the BM. Viral plaques could be observed at 24 hpi for all isolates in both respiratory and genital mucosa explants with the plaque latitude increasing over time. At 24 hpi, all the different subtypes spread more efficiently lateral in the epithelium of the genital tract compared to the respiratory tract. On the contrary, all BoHV- 1 subtypes exhibit a more profound invasion capacity in the respiratory tract at 24 h pi compared to the genital tract.

40|$|Bovine {{herpesvirus}} 1 (BoHV- 1), {{the cause}} of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and <b>infectious</b> <b>pustular</b> vulvovaginitis in cattle, establishes a lifelong infection, {{despite the presence of}} antiviral immunity in the host. BoHV- 1 has been shown to elude the host immune system, but the viral gene products responsible for this interference have not yet been identified. Studies aiming at the identification of BoHV- 1 -encoded immune evasion genes have been hampered by the lack of bovine-specific immunological reagents. Some of the immune evasion molecules identified for other herpesviruses are host species specific; others can act across the species barrier. In this study, experiments were performed to investigate whether BoHV- 1 can infect human cells and interfere with antigen processing and presentation in these cells. A human melanoma cell line, Mel JuSo, appeared to be permissive for BoHV- 1 infection. BoHV- 1 induced expression of major viral glycoproteins at the surface of these cells and produced progeny virus up to 105 plaque forming units per ml. BoHV- 1 infection resulted in impaired intracellular transport of human MHC class I molecules and inhibition of human TAP. These data indicate that the BoHV- 1 -encoded molecule(s) that block antigen presentation in bovine cells are able to interact with homologous components of the human MHC class I presentation pathway. The fact that immune evasion by BoHV- 1 can be studied in human cells will facilitate the identification of the BoHV- 1 gene products involved in this process. Moreover, the data presented here suggest that the BoHV- 1 encoded inhibitors of antigen presentation represent potential immune suppressive agents for use in humans...|$|R
40|$|Dioxin- 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is {{a common}} {{environmental}} toxin of current interest. In the last years, higher levels of TCDD than those permitted in UE [European Commission. 2002. European Commission Recommendation 2002 / 201 /CE. Official Gazette, L 67 / 69] were detected in milk samples from cow, water buffalo, goat, and sheep raised on some areas of Campania Region (South Italy). Dioxin often causes immunosuppression and might render the animal liable to viral infections. In addition, viral infections are able to alter the pattern of dioxin distribution in different organs of the exposed animals. Bovine Herpesvirus type- 1 (BHV- 1) is a widespread pathogen, which causes infectious rhinotracheitis and <b>infectious</b> <b>pustular</b> vulvovaginitis in cattle. Herein, we have studied the effects of TCDD and BHV- 1 infection, in Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cells, alone {{as well as in}} association, so as cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and virus replication. We have observed an increase in cell viability of confluent monolayers at low TCDD concentrations. TCDD treated cells demonstrated increased viability compared to controls as evaluated by MTT test. TCDD exposure increased cell proliferation but induced no changes on apoptosis. Cells exposed to TCDD along with BHV- 1 showed a dose-dependent increase in cytopathy, represented by ample syncytia formation with the elimination of the cellular sheets and increased viral titer. These results suggest that TCDD increases viral replication in MDBK cells while BHV- 1 further decreases viability of TCDD exposed cells. Since very low concentrations (0. 01 pg/ml) are sufficient to augment BHV- 1 titer, TCDD may contribute to reactivate BHV- 1 from latency, leading to recurrent disease and increase virus transmission...|$|R

The two vaccine strains were indistinguishable from one another, but were neutralized far more rapidly than the other four strains when either anti-IBR or anti-IPV 19 S AB was used. The two IPV strains were indistinguishable from one another, but were neutralized significantly more rapidly than the two IBR strains when anti-IBR 19 S AB was used. The 2 IBR strains were neutralized at a similar rate with the latter globulin preparation. Almost identical results were obtained with anti-IPV 19 S AB, except that one IPV strain was neutralized at a rate similar to the IBR strains. However, when early and late rabbit 7 S AB were used, IBR strains could not be distinguished from IPV strains by neutralization kinetics. Preliminary experiments indicated that both early and late 19 S rabbit antibodies neutralized the homologous strain more rapidly than the heterologous strain, but the difference was more noticeable with late 19 S AB. It was also determined that neutralization of IBR-IPV virus by specific early and late 19 S rabbit AB and early 7 S rabbit AB was markedly enhanced by guinea pig complement. Neutralization of this virus by late 7 S AB, however, was only slightly enhanced by complement. These results suggest that vaccine strains of IBR-IPV virus may be distinguished by neutralization kinetics with late 19 S rabbit AB, and that genital and respiratory strains may possibly also be distinguishable with some 19 S AB preparations...|$|R

Viral DNA was extracted from semen using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit and was then subjected to PCR. In gB gene based PCR, 47 (46. 53 %) semen samples were found to be positive, producing an amplified PCR product of size 478 bp. While in gC gene based PCR, 43 (42. 57 %) were found to be positive for presence of viral genome, producing an amplified PCR product of size 173 bp. In comparison of the efficacy of the primers, the results of these two primers were in agreement for 95 samples out of the 101 tested samples.

BoHV- 1 control programs have been initiated in several European countries including Germany. One of the major components is the vaccination with inactivated or attenuated glycoprotein E (gE) -deleted live marker vaccines. The {{aim of this study}} was the development of a triplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay for the sensitive, specific and reliable BoHV- 1 detection. A BoHV- 1 -specific glycoprotein D (gD) assay was combined with a gE-specific qPCR system for differentiation between wild-type strains and gE-negative vaccine virus strains. Finally, an internal control based on amplification of the bovine beta-actin gene was introduced to verify efficient DNA extraction and PCR amplification. The analytical sensitivity of the triplex BoHV- 1 qPCR enables the detection of 10 genome copies per reaction. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the newly developed qPCR assay was compared to an OIE-validated qPCR and the “gold standard” method of virus isolation in cell culture using 10 -fold dilution series of BoHV- 1 in extended semen as well as in cell culture medium. For all preparations, the tested qPCR assays showed comparable results and the sensitivity of the triplex qPCR was equal or even greater than that of virus isolation. A broad spectrum of reference strains and field isolates was detected reliably. The specificity of the test was confirmed using nasal swabs, semen and different organ materials of BoHV- 1 -negative cattle. Bovine herpesviruses type 2, 4 and 5 and further ruminant herpesviruses, namely bubaline herpesvirus (BuHV- 1), caprine herpesvirus type 1 and cervine herpesvirus type 1 and 2 (CvHV- 1, - 2) were tested as well. The close genetic and serological relationship between these viruses combined with their ability to infect bovines may interfere with diagnostics resulting in false-positive results. All non-BoHV- 1 herpesviruses were negative in the gD-specific assay, while BuHV- 1, CvHV- 1 and - 2 were tested positive by the gE-specific qPCR.

In addition to the cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis over disease and treatment, the animal welfare aspect is also involved. The purpose of this work is to review, describe and assess the available control measures against selected viral infections or diseases of domestic ruminants. The selected infections or diseases are bovine viral diarrhoea / mucosal disease (BVD), infectious bovine rhinotracheitis / <b>infectious</b> <b>pustular</b> vulvovaginitis (IBR), enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) and maedi–visna (MV) of sheep. Each is recognized as a signifi cant disease of domestic animals. Decisive control and eradication measures are necessarily based on the biological, veterinary and diagnostic characteristics of the affl ictions, {{as well as on}} their epidemiology in terms of the intrinsic determinants of the hosts, host–agent relationships and sources and transmission of the infection, and occurrence of these infections or diseases. This information is compiled and presented in the fi rst part of the thesis with special reference to available or possible control and eradication measures. These measures and programmes against the four affl ictions employed in major cattle and sheep producing countries in individuals and herds and on national and international levels are outlined and assessed briefl y. In the descriptive part of the thesis the domestic and EU legislation that forms the offi cial framework for disease control and eradication are outlined. The development in the situation concerning these four infections or diseases is described from the early records to date. The fi rst recorded entries of the occurrence of BVD and EBL in Finland date back to the 1960 s, those of IBR {{to the beginning of the}} 1970 s and of MV to the beginning of the 1980 s. Large-scale surveillance and health monitoring among dairy, suckler-cow and beef herds and sheep fl ocks, starting during the fi rst half of the 1990 s, enabled the estimation of actual prevalences of these infections and diseases. A common feature of the occurrence of these infections or diseases is that none has had a prevalence of more than an estimated few percent before 1990, and a maximum of 1 % since then. This has formed a very favourable starting point for the nation-wide control and eradication measures. The voluntary control programmes or schemes, as well as the offi cial control and eradication measures are described. The successful eradication of IBR and EBL in 1994 and 1996, respectively, and the signifi cant reduction in the occurrences of BVD and MV from 1990 to date, are reported in detail. The effi cacies of the offi cial control and eradication measures and of the actions of the voluntary control programmes or schemes are analyzed further, making use of a heuristic formulation for the infection reproduction number (R), i. e. the number of secondary cases produced by one infective animal. The infl uence of the measures is resolved into the three components of R: the probability of transmission, frequency of infectious contacts and length of the infectious period, and the impact of the measures on each component is graded on a three-step scale. 9 The conclusion is drawn that the offi cial measures complemented by voluntary actions for control and eradication have for the most part been adequate. The signifi cance of fi nancial compensation from the state for the costs incurred in the control of notifi able diseases is noted. In the case of BVD the decisive measures for fi nal eradication have only been available since 2004 and their impact will be seen in the next few years. The role of continued surveillance and health moni toring for both overseeing the situation with BVD and MV, and maintaining an IBR and EBLfree status is emphasized...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Infectious</b> bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious <b>pustular</b> {{vulvovaginitis}} (IBR/IPV) is {{a significant}} disease among domestic and wild cattle. The BHV- 1 infection was first detected in Finland in 1970; presumably it was imported in 1968. The infection reappeared in the large-scale bulk-tank milk surveillances which started in 1990, and was eradicated in 1994. Our aim is to describe the epidemiology of this infection in Finland, and its eradication. Materials and methods: The official sources of pertinent information, the legal basis for the disease control and the serological methods {{for the detection of}} the infection are described. Results and conclusion: Ten AI bulls were found to be seropositive in 1970 – 1971. The total number of herds with BHV- 1 antibody positive animals in the large-scale surveillance in 1990 and subsequent epidemiological investigations in 1991 was five, and the total number of seropositive animals was 90. The five herds formed three epidemiological units; semen of at least one bull seropositive in 1971 had been used in each unit. This remained the only plausible route of infection {{in each of the three}} units. Using the 'test and slaughter' approach and total stamping out in one herd the infection was eradicated in 1994...|$|R
40|$|<b>Infectious</b> bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious <b>pustular</b> {{vulvovaginitis}} (IBR/IPV) are {{diseases that}} affect cattle population of all breeds, categories and age. Both diseases, especially {{infectious bovine rhinotracheitis}} (IBR), poses severe health threat and causes major economic losses and {{is considered one of}} the “most costly” disease in cattle industry. The causal agent of the disease is a virus and any detection of IBR/IPV specific antibodies in non-vaccinated cattle, either in blood or milk, indicates that animal is infected and represents the source of infection. Countries with developed and intensive cattle breeding have been developed and implemented their national eradication programs to control IBR/IPV in accordance with international regulations. In this article, we outlined the needs and program for the eradication of IBR/IPV in the Republic of Serbia. The eradication program for IBR/IPV is an extensive process that requires systematic strategy involving different phases and activities. The eradication process from the moment of implementation until obtaining IBR/IPV-free status can last over several years and requires joint work and considerable financial resources that will be compansated with the elimination of IBR/IPV from the herd. This article gives an overview of all stages and activities regarding eradication of the disease and certification and maintaining of IBR/IPV-free herd status...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Infectious</b> bovine rhinotracheitis-Infectious <b>pustular</b> {{vulvovaginitis}} (IBR/IPV) {{virus was}} isolated and identified from {{a herd of}} cattle and buffaloes, suffering from respiratory and genital disorders during May 2007. These animals were located at Giza Governorate with a total number of 350, (200 in open farms and 150 in closed farms). Vaginal, nasal and ocular swabs were collected (136 samples were collected from the open farm and 55 samples were collected from the closed farm). By inoculation on MDBK, 23 suspected viral isolates gave clear cytopathic effect (CPE) and by fluorescent antibody technique (FAT) ten IBR viral isolates were identified, showing clear intranuclear inclusion bodies. Serologically, a total number of 86 serum samples were collected from cattle, buffalo calves aged from 3 – 12 months and adult dairy cattle and buffaloes and were tested for IBR / IPV antibodies by ELISA. ELISA demonstrated all types of antibodies to the virus. The highest percentage of positive reactors was reported for acute convalescent cattle (85. 7 %) in closed farms followed by acute convalescent adult cattle (66 %) in open farms. While the incidence in apparently healthy cattle in closed farms was 80 % and in open farms were 62. 5 %. The percent of positive reactors in buffaloes were 40 %, which is less than percent of cattle present in contact {{with them in the}} same open farm. The positive reactors in cattle and buffaloe calves were 62. 5 and 40 %, in 3 - 6 months of age and 50 and 33 % in 6 - 13 months of age, respectively. ELISA is considered the most rapid, reliable, inexpensive and simple test and is particularly well suited to the analysis {{of a large number of}} samples.

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of hybridoma cells by Kohler and Milstein, the uses of monoclonal antibody (mAb), the protein produced by such cells are in vogue. Such antibodies with single isotype have higher specificity, and the serological tests employed in show higher reproducibility compared to those with use of polyclonal antisera. There are several procedures of mAb production which vary considerably but the principle remains the same which states that antigens introduced into animals generally result in the stimulation of lymphocytes, some of which produce antibody of only one type, although the isotype may change. The developments {{in the field of}} cell culture and transfection technology have lead to the production of im proved qualities of mAbs. In general, monoclonal antibodies are important reagents used in biomedical research, such as, in the field of diagnostics and therapeutics as well as targeted drug delivery systems. They have got importance not only for infectious diseases caused by microbes and parasites, but also for cancer, metabolic and hormonal disorders, in the diagnosis of lymphoid and myeloid malignancies and tissue typing, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (especially blocking ELISA), radio immunoassay (RIA), serotyping of pathogens and their immunological intervention with passive antibody, anti-idiotype inhibition or magic bullet therapy with cytotoxic agents coupled with antimouse specific antibody. The application of mAbs in diagnosis of vari ous livestock diseases is an important area of concern as these diseases are a major and increasingly important factor reducing livestock productivity {{in various parts of the}} world. In this context, the application of mAbs for diagnosis of important bacterial diseases viz., Anthrax, Brucellosis, Paratuberculosis, Leptospirosis, Listeriosis, Clostridial infections and Mycoplasmosis (CBPP), fungal diseases viz., Zygomycosis, Cryptococcosis, Histoplasmosis and Paracoccidiodomycosis, viral diseases viz., Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), <b>Infectious</b> bovine rhinotracheitis/Infectious <b>pustular</b> vulvovaginitis (IBR/IPV), Rota viral diarrhoea, Blue tongue, Rabies, Classical swine fever and re-emerging viral diseases like Hendra and Nipah v iral infections and parasitic diseases viz., dirofilariosis, and Trichinellosis and haemportozoan diseases (including Trypanosomiasis, Leishmaniasis, Anaplasmosis, infections caused by Plasmodium spp. as well as tick borne diseases) have been discussed thoroughly along with the specifications of the diagnostic assays for each disease for the convenience of the diagnosticians, researchers, scientists and students to employ such assays, both in field and laboratories to strengthen the disease control programme. </p...|$|R
