5|$|Nevertheless, it {{was mainly}} food that the {{inhabitants}} of Jerusalem needed. Starting 5 June, the Israeli engineers started to fix the road so that <b>it</b> <b>let</b> civil transport trucks pass to supply the city. 150 workers, working in four teams, installed a pipeline to supply the city with water, because the other pipeline, crossing Latrun, had been cut by the Jordanians. In O Jerusalem, Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins talked about heroic action, when during the night of 6–7 June, in fear of the critical situation of Jerusalem and to improve {{the morale of the}} population, 300 inhabitants of Tel Aviv were requisitioned to carry on their backs, for the few kilometers not yet ready for the trucks, what would be needed to feed {{the inhabitants of}} Jerusalem one more day.|$|E

25|$|On July 2, 1871, a Hyōgo prefectural {{police officer}} brought a woman {{suspected}} of prostitution {{in to the}} station from within the foreign settlement. Once the investigation determined {{that she was a}} servant of the Englishman Mr. Walters, who lived within the settlement, she was released. However, Walters was angry over the affair, and on the next day, July 3, he trapped two police officers he believed to have been involved in her arrest within his estate. The case fell under consular jurisdiction and was judged by the English consul Abel Gower, who judged that the Japanese officers were unable to exercise police power in the settlement—not even to patrol <b>it,</b> <b>let</b> alone arrest anyone. Thus, Walters was not found guilty of obstruction of justice against the officers, but only of false imprisonment. This judgment clarified that only the settlement police, under the authority of the executive committee, was allowed to undertake police action in the settlement. Hyōgo Prefecture remained unable to exercise these powers in the settlement until its return in 1899.|$|E

Several existing tenants also said they would spend another $3 million on remodeling and expansion. MM Cohn updated their store and added a mall entrance on their second floor. The J.C.

It was referred to as the skylight because <b>it</b> <b>let</b> so much light in. The skylight reached nine stories high and a height variance had to be sought for its construction. The concourse was expanded to two levels connected by escalators and an elevator. The new upper level had a cantilevered walkway overlooking the bottom level and a [...] food court.

500|$|Generally, {{the party}} wants a stricter {{immigration}} policy, {{so that only}} {{those who are in}} need of protection according to the UN Refugee Convention are allowed to stay in Norway. In a speech in the 2007 election campaign, Siv Jensen claimed that the immigration policy was a failure because <b>it</b> <b>let</b> criminals stay in Norway, while throwing out people who worked hard and followed the law. The party claims the immigration and integration policy to be naïve. In 2009, the party proposed an official goal of reducing accepted asylum seekers by about 90%, from 1,000 to 100 a month, the standards then said to be used in Denmark and Finland, although less than 100 a year was proposed in 2008. In 2008, the party wanted to [...] "avoid illiterates and other poorly resourced groups who we see are not able to adapt in Norway"; which included countries as Somalia, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The party opposes that asylum seekers are allowed stay in Norway on humanitarian grounds or due to health issues, and seeks to substantially limit the number of family reunifications. The party has also called for a referendum on the general immigration policy.|$|E

Smith, known for his segregationist views and eager to embarrass and possibly destroy the FEPC, quickly scheduled a hearing.

[...] The hearing in front of Smith's committee took place on January 11, 1944.

500|$|Zinta was {{the female}} lead in India's three highest-grossing films of 2003: , Koi... Mil Gaya and Kal Ho Naa Ho. The Hero, co-starring Sunny Deol and Priyanka Chopra, is a {{patriotic}} {{drama about a}} spy network involving terrorists and an Indian army officer. Zinta played the part of Reshma, a villager {{who falls in love}} with the officer and becomes part of this network. The film, involving stunts never seen before in the cinematic history of Bollywood, became the most expensive Hindi film ever produced at the time. Despite being the third highest-grossing film of that year, it failed to recover its production costs at the box office. She next starred in Honey Irani's directorial debut, Armaan, alongside Amitabh Bachchan and Anil Kapoor. This drama is set in a hospital and follows the travails of its personnel and its principal, Dr. Akash, who struggles arduously to sustain the institution financially. Zinta played Akash's schizophrenic wife Sonia Kapoor, a role written specially for her and which she liked because <b>it</b> <b>let</b> her [...] "give vent to all [...] frustrations". The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Zinta was particularly praised. Khalid Mohamed called her a [...] "peppy scene-stealer, achieving her manic mood swings dexterously." [...] For her performance, she received nominations for Best Performance in a Negative Role at different award ceremonies, including Filmfare.|$|E

It's a film whose influence is hard to overstate, one that proves for not {{the last time that}} it's easier to break into a safe than fathom the mysteries of the human heart." [...] Lucia Bozzola of the online database Allmovie gave the film the highest possible rating of five stars, calling it [...] "The pinnacle of heist movies" [...] and [...] "not only one of the best French noirs, but one of the top movies in the genre." [...] In 2002, critic Roger Ebert added the film to his list of [...] "Great Movies" [...] stating [...] "echoes of [...] can be found from Kubrick's [...] "The Killing" [...] to Tarantino's [...] "Reservoir Dogs." [...] They both owe something to John Huston's [...] "The Asphalt Jungle" [...] (1950), which has the general idea but not the attention to detail." [...] Among negative reviews of the film, Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader felt that [...] "the film turns moralistic and sour in the last half, when the thieves fall out." [...] Rififi placed at number 90 on Empires list of The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema. Critic and director Jean-Luc Godard regarded the film negatively in comparison to other French crime films of the era, noting in 1986 that [...] "today it can't hold a candle to Touchez pas au grisbi which paved the way for <b>it,</b> <b>let</b> alone Bob le flambeur which it paved the way for." ...|$|E

500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's {{one of my}} {{favorite}} songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands out to me cause I vividly remember the day of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, where a lot of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone in the room that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck <b>it,</b> <b>let</b> me just play y'all a piece of the song so you could see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E
