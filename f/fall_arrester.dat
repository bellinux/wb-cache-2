This is supplemented in most models by a restraining point, designed {{to secure a}} harness or <b>fall</b> <b>arrester.</b> Some work platforms also have a lip around {{the floor of the}} platform itself to avoid tools or supplies being accidentally kicked off the platform. Some protocols require all equipment to be attached to the structure by individual lanyards.|$|E

These devices are used under different atmospheric conditions {{and in the}} presence of various types of industrial pollution. For this reason appropriate locking after conditioning simulating extreme conditions of a worksite is one of the essential characteristics of retractable type <b>fall</b> <b>arresters.</b> This article presents the requirements for locking of the devices. A previously used locking test method and its disadvantages are discussed. The article suggests an improved test method and test equipment. Measurement of the test mass acceleration is the most important improvement introduced into the test method. The article shows laboratory tests used to verify the method, {{which turned out to be}} a valuable source of information concerning the performance of retractable type <b>fall</b> <b>arresters.</b> personal protective equipment against falls from a height retractable type <b>fall</b> <b>arresters</b> locking test method measurement of acceleration signals 1...|$|R

It uses a static line and <b>fall</b> <b>arresters</b> attached to the demolition harness. It is designed for use during ramping, decking and positioning kerbs.|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} arresting a {{fall from a height}} by {{protective}} equipment is characterised by {{two most important}} values: the arrest force and the distance over which the fall arrest oc-curs. The time course of these values is determined primarily by the mechanical parameters of the connecting and shock-absorbing components of the fall arrest system, such as textile energy absorbers, retractable type <b>fall</b> <b>arresters</b> and guided type <b>fall</b> <b>arresters.</b> The paper presents the methods of testing used up till now to determine the properties of connect-ing and shock-absorbing components. Their disadvantages are demonstrated and a new method allowing to determine the load-elongation characteristics of connecting and shock-absorbing components containing textile elements is described. The method presented and test stand are based on simultaneous measurements of the force acting in the object inves-tigated and its elongation. For measurements of elongation under dynamic conditions, an extensometer equipped with a high speed camera was used. The results of tests performed under static and dynamic conditions on objects made of fibre rope and webbing used in equipment protecting against falls from a height are presented. The results obtained demon...|$|R
