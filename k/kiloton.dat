5|$|Nike Zeus was an {{anti-ballistic missile}} (ABM) system {{developed}} by the US Army during the late 1950s and early 1960s, designed to destroy Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile warheads before they could hit targets in the United States. It was designed by Bell's Nike team, and was initially based on the earlier Nike Hercules anti-aircraft missile. The original Zeus A, given the tri-service identifier XLIM-49, was designed to intercept warheads in the upper atmosphere, mounting a 25 <b>kiloton</b> W31 nuclear warhead. During development, the concept changed to protect a much larger area and intercept the warheads at higher altitudes. This required the missile to be greatly enlarged into the totally new design, Zeus B, mounting a 400 <b>kiloton</b> W50 warhead. In several successful tests, the B model proved itself able to intercept warheads, and even satellites.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{initially}} considered using {{a hydrogen}} bomb for the project, but the United States Air Force vetoed this idea {{due to the}} weight of such a device, {{as it would be}} too heavy to be propelled by the missile which would have been used. It was then decided to use a W25 warhead, a small, lightweight warhead with a relatively low 1.7 <b>kiloton</b> yield. By contrast, the Little Boy bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945 had a yield of some 13–18 kilotons. The W25 would be carried by a rocket toward the hidden side of the Moon, near the terminator, where it would detonate on impact. The dust cloud resulting from the explosion would be lit by the Sun and therefore visible from Earth. According to Reiffel, the Air Force's progress in the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles would have made such a launch feasible by 1959.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1990s, {{progress}} accelerated {{towards a}} {{comprehensive test ban}} treaty (CTBT). Following a series of international meetings on the subject, the UN General Assembly approved resolution 50/64, which appealed for states to follow the PTBT and called for conclusion of the CTBT talks. In September 1996, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was signed and superseded the PTBT, though the PTBT is still in effect for states not party to the CTBT. The CTBT has yet to enter into force, as 8 required states have not ratified the treaty, including the US and China. France, Russia, and the UK have ratified the CTBT. The technology for detecting underground tests has significantly improved since the 1950s and 1960s, with monitors detecting tests down to 1 <b>kiloton</b> {{with a high degree of}} confidence.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} fishing areas of the rose fish is the Irminger Sea between Iceland and southeastern Greenland.While annual catches during the 1980s and 90s were less than 20 <b>kilotons,</b> this has {{increased}} dramatically since 1999, to between 40 and 60 <b>kilotons.</b> In 2000, almost 80 <b>kilotons</b> were caught. Since then, annual catch has declined back to between 40 and 60 <b>kilotons.</b> The meat of this fish is almost always sold filleted, often frozen.|$|R
50|$|After {{connection}} to the rail network, coupled with expansion of the port, and wider industrial development the tonnage handled through the port increased from around 160 <b>kilotons</b> in 1854, to nearly 3,800 <b>kilotons</b> in 1911. The opening and growth of Immingham Dock coupled with a wider decline in exports reduced tonnage to around 620 <b>kilotons</b> by 1938. After the Second World War the tonnage peaked at 1,500 <b>kilotons</b> in 1956, and declined to 640 kilotones by 1962.|$|R
50|$|The Korea Institute of Geosciences and Mineral Resources {{estimated}} the yield as 7.7-7.8 <b>kilotons</b> while the Japanese put the estimation between 8 and 10 <b>kilotons.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{office of}} John Negroponte, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence {{confirmed}} {{that the size of}} the explosion was less than 1 <b>kiloton.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first {{underground}} {{nuclear test}} {{was conducted on}} 29 November 1951. This was the 1.2 <b>kiloton</b> Buster-Jangle Uncle, which detonated 5.2m (17ft) beneath ground level. The test {{was designed as a}} scaled-down investigation of the effects of a 23 <b>kiloton</b> ground penetrating gun-type device that was then being considered for use as a cratering and bunker-buster weapon. The explosion resulted in a cloud that rose to 3,500 m (11,500ft), and deposited fallout to the north and north-northeast. The resulting crater was 79m (260ft) wide and 16m (53ft) deep.|$|E
25|$|On October 3, 2006, North Korea {{announced}} {{its intention to}} conduct a nuclear test. The blast is generally estimated to have had an explosive force of less than one <b>kiloton,</b> and some radioactive output was detected. United States officials suggested the device {{may have been a}} nuclear explosive that misfired.|$|E
50|$|Finally, the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty limits all {{civilian}} purpose nuclear explosions to a {{yield of}} 150 <b>kilotons</b> and an aggregate group yield of 1,500 <b>kilotons.</b>|$|R
25|$|However 7 years later, {{after the}} 2013 nuclear test, the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources, a state-run geology {{research}} institute in Germany, estimated the yield ranging at minimum of 700 tons {{to the max}} of 2 <b>kilotons</b> and the 2009 test ranges from minimum of 5 <b>kilotons</b> to the max of 12 <b>kilotons</b> instead with relevant statistics.|$|R
50|$|Growth of the Grimsby {{fishing fleet}} caused the tonnage of fish landed to {{increase}} from 0.188 <b>kilotons</b> in 1855; to 30 <b>kilotons</b> in 1871, with 302 vessels operating from the port. Steam fishing began , and this, coupled with diminishing North Sea fish stocks caused fishing {{to take place}} increasingly further afield - in 1911 landings from UK boats at the port were 190 <b>kilotons.</b> Demand was reduced in the interwar period, though recovered to 198 <b>kilotons</b> in 1951. Grimsby landed approximately 20% of UK fish in this period.|$|R
25|$|On October 9, 2006, North Korea {{announced}} it had successfully conducted its first nuclear test. An {{underground nuclear explosion}} was detected, its yield was estimated as less than a <b>kiloton,</b> and some radioactive output was detected. On January 6, 2007, the North Korean government further confirmed that it had nuclear weapons.|$|E
25|$|By comparison, {{the first}} {{plutonium}} core nuclear device {{tested by the}} United States (Trinity test) had a yield of 20 kilotons of TNT, and the first nuclear device detonated by India in 1974, though of primitive design, had a yield {{in the region of}} 8 kilotons of TNT. If the North Korean nuclear test is less than even a <b>kiloton</b> in yield, it would be a historically small inaugural nuclear test. Even if it were as many as the reported intentional yield of 4 kt it would be the smallest nuclear test ever conducted by a state as a first test. Some advanced nuclear powers have produced very small tactical nuclear weapons in the low-kiloton range, but their development is far more technologically challenging than that of weapons in the 15–20 <b>kiloton</b> range, requiring advanced weapons materials and core geometries.|$|E
25|$|On October 9, 2006, North Korea {{demonstrated}} {{its nuclear}} capabilities with its first underground nuclear test, detonating a plutonium based device and the estimated yield was 0.2–1 <b>kiloton.</b> The test {{was conducted at}} P'unggye-yok, and U.S. intelligence officials later announced that analysis of radioactive debris in air samples collected {{a few days after}} the test confirmed that the blast had taken place. The UN Security Council condemned the test in Resolution 1874.|$|E
50|$|South Korea's defense {{ministry}} {{said the}} event reading indicated {{a blast of}} 6-7 <b>kilotons,</b> later revised to 6-9 <b>kilotons</b> using the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization's calculation method.|$|R
50|$|Russia {{placed the}} yield {{of the test}} {{significantly}} higher at 10 to 20 <b>kilotons.</b> This was approximately the yield of the Fat Man and Trinity bombs developed by the United States during World War II. However, the Russians had also previously estimated a far higher yield of 5 to 10 <b>kilotons</b> when other sources estimated a yield of 0.5 to 0.9 <b>kilotons</b> in the 2006 test as well.|$|R
5|$|Among {{the nine}} {{underground}} tests, which were carried between 1962 and 1969 and codenamed Anacostia (5.2 <b>kilotons,</b> 1962), Kennebec (<5 <b>kilotons,</b> 1963), Par (38, <b>kilotons,</b> 1964), Barbel (<20 <b>kilotons,</b> 1964), Tweed (<20 <b>kilotons,</b> 1965), Cyclamen (13 <b>kilotons,</b> 1966), Kankakee (20-200 <b>kilotons,</b> 1966), Vulcan (25 <b>kilotons,</b> 1966) and Hutch (20-200 <b>kilotons,</b> 1969), {{the last one}} was most powerful and had the highest yield of transuranium elements. In the dependence on the atomic mass number, the yield showed a saw-tooth behavior with the lower values for odd isotopes, due to their higher fission rates. The major practical problem of the entire proposal was however collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4 of the total amount and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 10−7 of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4 kg rock picked up 7 days after the test. This observation demonstrated the highly nonlinear dependence of the transuranium elements yield {{on the amount of}} retrieved radioactive rock. In order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, shafts were drilled at the site not after but before the test, so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter, through the shafts, to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in the Anacostia and Kennebec tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material, but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling; whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.|$|R
25|$|ERWs {{are more}} {{accurately}} described as suppressed yield weapons. When the yield {{of a nuclear}} weapon is less than one <b>kiloton,</b> its lethal radius from blast, , is less than that from its neutron radiation. However, the blast is more than potent enough to destroy most structures, which are less resistant to blast effects than even unprotected human beings. Blast pressures of upwards of 20 PSI are survivable, whereas most buildings will collapse with a pressure of only 5 PSI.|$|E
25|$|A {{neutron bomb}} is only {{feasible}} if the yield is sufficiently high that efficient fusion stage ignition is possible, {{and if the}} yield is low enough that the case thickness will not absorb too many neutrons. This means that neutron bombs have a yield range of 1–10 kilotons, with fission proportion varying from 50% at 1-kiloton to 25% at 10-kilotons (all of which comes from the primary stage). The neutron output per <b>kiloton</b> is then 10–15 times greater than for a pure fission implosion weapon or for a strategic warhead like a W87 or W88.|$|E
25|$|The {{public records}} for devices that {{produced}} the highest proportion of their yield via fusion-only reactions are the peaceful nuclear explosions of the 1970s, with the 3 detonations that excavated part of Pechora–Kama Canal being cited as 98% fusion each in the Taiga test's 15 <b>kiloton</b> explosive yield devices; that is, a total fission fraction of 0.3 kilotons in a 15 kt device. Others include the 50 megaton Tsar Bomba at 97% fusion, the 9.3 megaton Hardtack Poplar test at 95.2%, and the 4.5 megaton Redwing Navajo test at 95% fusion.|$|E
5|$|After {{hostilities}} ended, {{a survey}} {{team from the}} Manhattan Project that included William Penney, Robert Serber, and George T. Reynolds was sent to Hiroshima to evaluate {{the effects of the}} blast. From evaluating the effects on objects and structures, Penney concluded that the yield was 12 ± 1 <b>kilotons.</b> Later calculations based on charring pointed to a yield of 13 to 14 <b>kilotons.</b> In 1953, Frederick Reines calculated the yield as 13 <b>kilotons.</b> This figure became the official yield.|$|R
50|$|He {{said his}} work {{contributed to the}} {{creation}} of bombs 30 times smaller and 30 times more powerful than those used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki—an increase from 15 <b>kilotons</b> to 475 <b>kilotons</b> in a nuclear package the size of a bowling ball.|$|R
50|$|The W76 has a {{yield of}} 100 <b>kilotons.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1960, while Sweden was {{deciding}} on its stance toward nuclear weapons, Swedish representatives, through their {{contacts with the}} American Department of Defense gained access to some secret information in the late 1960s. This information included nuclear weapons tactics, reconnaissance requirements, ideas regarding the necessity of quick decision-making, and nuclear physics data. Swedish representatives also looked at the MGR-1 Honest John weapons system that could utilize W7 or W31 nuclear warheads. For artillery purposes, the US developed a W48 projectile for 155mm artillery with 0.072 <b>kiloton</b> effect. Any plans for such a small Swedish nuclear device have never been recovered.|$|E
25|$|After {{establishment}} {{of its own}} deterrent force, the Force de Dissuassion, more {{commonly known as the}} Force de frappe, France withdrew from the military command structure of NATO in 1966. French President Charles de Gaulle viewed the operational {{establishment of}} the Mirage IV fleet, a critical component of the independent Force de frappe, as highly influential to his decision to withdraw France from NATO, and that an independent French nuclear deterrent was necessary to ensure independence as a nation. From 1964 to 1971, the Mirage IV was France's sole means of delivering nuclear ordnance, at this point they were armed with a single 60 <b>kiloton</b> nuclear bomb each.|$|E
25|$|For each goal {{overpressure}} {{there is}} a certain optimum burst height at which the blast range is maximized over ground targets. In a typical air burst, where the blast range is maximized to produce the greatest range of severe damage, i.e. the greatest range that ~ of pressure is extended over, is a GR/ground range of 0.4km for 1 <b>kiloton</b> (kt) of TNT yield; 1.9km for 100 kt; and 8.6km for 10 megatons (Mt) of TNT. The optimum height of burst to maximize this desired severe ground range destruction for a 1 kt bomb is 0.22km; for 100 kt, 1km; and for 10 Mt, 4.7km.|$|E
25|$|Pure fission or fusion-boosted fission weapons {{can be made}} {{to yield}} {{hundreds}} of <b>kilotons,</b> at great expense in fissile material and tritium, but by far {{the most efficient way to}} increase nuclear weapon yield beyond ten or so <b>kilotons</b> is to add a second independent stage, called a secondary.|$|R
50|$|The {{earthquake}} {{caused by}} the 2016 nuclear test was 5.1 magnitude, similar to the 5.1-magnitude earthquake that accompanied North Korea's previous 2013 nuclear test (which was estimated by South Korea to have a yield of 6-9 <b>kilotons</b> of TNT and Russian estimates of more than 7 <b>kilotons</b> of TNT).|$|R
50|$|The W68 had {{a design}} yield of 40-50 <b>kilotons.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1974, the United States and the Soviet Union {{signed the}} Threshold Test Ban Treaty, which banned {{underground}} tests with yields greater than 150 kilotons. By the 1990s, technologies {{to monitor and}} detect underground tests had matured {{to the point that}} tests of one <b>kiloton</b> or over could be detected with high probability, and in 1996 negotiations began {{under the auspices of the}} United Nations to develop a comprehensive test ban. The resulting Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was signed in 1996 by the United States, Russia, United Kingdom, France, and China. However, following the United States Senate decision not to ratify the treaty in 1999, it is still yet to be ratified by 8 of the required 44 'Annex 2' states and so has not entered into force as United Nations law.|$|E
25|$|The Plowshare project {{developed}} the Sedan test {{in order to}} determine the feasibility of using nuclear detonations to quickly and economically excavate large amounts of earth and rock. Proposed applications included the creation of harbors, canals, open pit mines, railroad and highway cuts through mountainous terrain and the construction of dams. Assessment of the full effects of the Sedan shot showed that the radioactive fallout from such uses would be extensive. Public concerns about the health effects and a lack of political support eventually led to abandonment of the concept. No such nuclear excavation has since been undertaken by the United States, though the Soviet Union continued to pursue the concept through their program Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy, particularly with their 140 <b>kiloton</b> Chagan (nuclear test), which created an artificial lake reservoir (see Lake Chagan).|$|E
25|$|By {{investing}} {{heavily in}} breeding plutonium in early nuclear reactors {{and in the}} electromagnetic and gaseous diffusion enrichment processes {{for the production of}} uranium-235, the United States was able to develop three usable weapons by mid-1945. The Trinity test was a plutonium implosion-design weapon tested on 16 July 1945, with around a 20 <b>kiloton</b> yield. Faced with an imminent invasion of the Japanese home islands and with Japan not surrendering, President Harry S. Truman ordered the atomic raids on enemy cities. On 6 August, a uranium-gun design bomb, Little Boy, was detonated over the Japanese city of Hiroshima with an energy of about 15 kilotons of TNT, destroying nearly 50,000 buildings (including the 2nd General Army and Fifth Division headquarters) and killing approximately 70,000 people, among them 20,000 Japanese combatants and 20,000 Korean slave laborers. On 9 August, a plutonium implosion-design bomb, Fat Man, was used against the Japanese city of Nagasaki with the explosion equivalent to about 20 kilotons of TNT, destroying 60% of the city and killing approximately 35,000 people, among them 23,200–28,200 Japanese munitions workers, 2,000 Korean slave laborers, and 150 Japanese combatants.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{yield of}} the W87 was 300 <b>kilotons</b> of TNT, {{but has the}} announced ability to be upgraded to a yield of 475 <b>kilotons,</b> presumably by using more HEU in the fusion secondary stage tamper. It is not known if that upgrade was completely tested or merely designed and ready to implement.|$|R
50|$|The {{initial mass}} of the meteor has been {{estimated}} at between 1,000 and 25,000 tons. Estimates for the energy released have varied from 9 <b>kilotons,</b> 100 <b>kilotons,</b> and 5 megatons, though most estimates place the energy at below 1 megaton. Regardless, the event was significantly smaller than the 10-15 megaton Tunguska event.|$|R
