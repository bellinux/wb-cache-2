50|$|The {{introduction}} of polymer-modified bitumen and <b>emulsion</b> <b>binder</b> has increased chipseal's ability to prevent crack reflection and improve stone retention by improving {{the properties of}} the bitumen binder. Newer techniques use asphalt emulsion (a mixture of liquid asphalt, surfactant, and water) instead of asphalt. This has been shown to help reduce aggregate loss and reduce cost of installation, but can increase stripping. It reduces emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) due to the lower solvent content. New methods also utilize cross linking styrene acrylic polymers which also provide quality water resistance. Chips precoated with about one percent bitumen have been used successfully to minimize aggregate loss and to give the surface a black look. It can keep good pavement in good condition by sealing out water, but provides no structural strength and will repair only minor cracks. While the small stones used as surface yield a relatively even surface without the edges of patches, it also results in a very rough surface that leads to louder rolling noise from automobile wheels.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{process of}} fine coal {{agglomeration}} is a beneficiation technique that uses an organic liquid, such as, diesel, to agglomerate fine coal from an aqueous suspension of coal and mineral particles. The organic binding liquid is dispersed in the aqueous suspension {{through the application}} of agitation and selectively wets and agglomerates the hydrophobic coal particles. The hydrophilic mineral particles remain finely dispersed and, thus, the product coal agglomerates can be easily retrieved by passing the suspension over a screen. Fine coal agglomeration can achieve high quality beneficiation and allows for more effective dewatering of a fine coal feed. Regardless of these excellent capabilities, however, there are no industrial applications of this process. This is because the high cost of the oil makes the process economically unfeasible. Therefore, in this study a modified fine coal agglomeration process has been investigated in which the aim is {{to reduce the amount of}} organic liquid required in the process. The modification involves the use of a water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion as the immiscible binding liquid, replacing the conventional pure oil approach. A high internal phase (HIP) emulsion is used as it provides the interfacial functionality of the oil, while the space filling functionality is provided by the stabilised internal water droplets. In this study, an investigation into the kinetics of agglomeration of the modified process was undertaken. It was found that complete agglomeration of the carbonaceous material in the feed could be achieved by the <b>emulsion</b> <b>binder</b> in one third of the time required for a pure diesel binder. In addition, the improved kinetics were achieved by the <b>emulsion</b> <b>binder</b> at an organic liquid dosage of five-times less than required by a pure diesel binder...|$|E

40|$|Fine coal may be {{separated}} from an aqueous suspension of coal and mineral particles {{through the application of}} a pure oil. The pure oil preferentially wets and agglomerates only the coal, forming a high quality, granular product. However, the use of the pure oil also comes at a relatively high cost and this cost prohibits commercial implementation of this process. In this work a new, economic binder, was introduced. This binder consisted of a high internal phase water-in-oil emulsion which was 95. vol% water and 5. vol% organic. This type of binder was selected as it possessed the hydrophobic surface functionality of oil while the space filling functionality of the binder was primarily satisfied by the dispersed water droplets within the emulsion. The application of this emulsion in the agglomeration process led to a 10 -fold reduction in the organic liquid dosage required to achieve agglomeration as compared a pure oil binder.

40|$|Polymer-modified bitumen {{emulsions}} {{present a}} {{safer and more}} environmentally friendly binder for enhancing the properties of roads. Cationic bitumen emulsion binders containing polymer latex were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The latex was incorporated into the bitumen emulsion by using four different addition methods and all emulsions were processed with a conventional colloid mill. The <b>emulsion</b> <b>binder</b> films were studied after evaporation of the emulsion aqueous phase. We show how the microstructure and distribution of the polymer varies within the bitumen binder depending on latex addition method, and that the microstructure of the binder remains intact when exposed to elevated temperature. It was found that a distinctly fine dispersion of polymer results when the polymer is blended into the bitumen before the emulsifying process (a monophase emulsion). In contrast, bi-phase emulsion binders produced by either post-adding the latex to the bitumen emulsion, or by adding the latex into the emulsifier solution phase before processing, or by comilling the latex with the bitumen, water and emulsifier all resulted in a network formation of bitumen particles surrounded by a continuous polymer film. The use of emulsified binders appears {{to result in a}} more evenly distributed polymer network compared to the use of hot polymer-modified binders, and they therefore have greater potential for consistent binder cohesion strength, stone retention and therefore improved pavement performance...|$|E
40|$|Selective {{agglomeration}} {{using an}} oil binder {{has been considered}} for the processing of fine coal {{many times in the}} past. However, the cost of the oil binder has always proven to be too high for commercial applications. This work revisited the technique of fine coal agglomeration in an effort to create an economically viable process and, thus, increase the overall utilisation of the coal resource. A novel and economic binder which consisted of a water-in-oil emulsion (95 vol% water and 5 vol% oil) was introduced. This emulsion was considered to be an economic alternative to pure oil as it had the potential to drastically reduce the amount of oil required in the process. A reduction was possible as the dispersed water droplets within the emulsion occupied the majority of the void space within the agglomerate; a space which would otherwise have to be filled with oil. In other words, the emulsion possessed an enhanced space-filling functionality. The use of oil as the continuous phase also meant that the necessary hydrophobic surface functionality of the binder was maintained. In this study the selectivity of the new <b>emulsion</b> <b>binder</b> was investigated and compared to the selectivity of a pure kerosene binder. The coal feed used in the study contained particles in the size range of 0 – 2 mm which also afforded the opportunity to study the ability of the emulsion to agglomerate and recover coal over a broad size range. It was found that the selectivity of the emulsion matched that of pure kerosene and consistently resulted in a low, < 15 (%ad), ash product.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with improving this process of selective agglomeration using an immiscible binding liquid by maximising the functionality of the binder. In the past, research into the area of selective agglomeration has focussed {{on the use of}} only pure oils as binders. Pure oils are highly suitable, in a technical sense, as they are hydrophobic, immiscible with water and will preferentially wet hydrophobic particles in a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic particles. However, pure oils are equally highly unsuitable due to their cost when combined with the dosages required in the agglomeration process. Therefore, to address this issue and thus reduce the costs associated with the organic binder, a high internal phase water-in-oil emulsion was introduced as the binder. This type of emulsion was selected as it possessed the hydrophobic surface functionality of oil while the space filling functionality of the binder was primarily satisfied by the dispersed water droplets within the emulsion. In other words, it was considered that by replacing the majority of the oil with water within the binder and subsequently the agglomerate structure, the overall organic liquid requirement would be substantially reduced. The solid feed material used throughout all of the work was a naturally occurring mixture of coal and mineral particles, coal being naturally hydrophobic and minerals such as clays, being generally hydrophilic. Initial experiments indicated that the emulsion could selectively agglomerate coal {{in the same manner as}} pure diesel. Moreover, by comparing the organic liquid dosage required to achieve agglomeration when using the emulsion with the dosage required when using pure diesel it was established that a 2 -fold reduction in the organic liquid requirement was achieved. A series of investigations was then carried out which examined the influence of the composition of the emulsion and process parameters on the performance of the emulsion. It was found that the initial result could be improved by reducing the level of degradation the emulsion experienced during the agglomeration process. The highlight of this work was the result for a 3 wt% aqueous NaCl-in-kerosene emulsion which achieved a 10 -fold reduction as compared to the benchmark diesel case. This emulsion achieved agglomeration in only 7 s and thus experienced the lowest level of degradation which resulted from mixing in the turbulent, aqueous environment of the agglomeration process. Moreover, it was shown that if the emulsion was pre-dispersed in water prior to the combination of the emulsion with the coal slurry the mixing time required to achieve agglomeration was only 3 s. Following on from the development of the <b>emulsion</b> <b>binder,</b> a fundamental investigation into binder functionality was carried out. It was found that the organic liquid requirement to achieve agglomeration was a function of the specific surface area of the material to be agglomerated and the voidage within the agglomerate material. Moreover, it appeared that the dispersed, water droplets within the emulsion played a space filling role within the void spaces, as hypothesised, however the thin film which formed around the particles comprised only of organic liquid and thus the water droplets did not play a space-filling role. That being said, the results indicated that the film formed when using the emulsion was 178 nm which was approximately 4 -times thinner than the film formed when using pure kerosene. Therefore, the results from this investigation indicated that the reduction which may be achieved is a function not only of the dispersed phase of the emulsion but also of the surface area of the feed. Due to the successful development of the agglomeration process using the emulsion a final investigation was carried out to study the potential application of this work in an industrial coal processing setting. It was found that the ash% and moisture content of the agglomerated product was sufficiently low to meet market requirements. In particular it was found that the <b>emulsion</b> <b>binder</b> consistently produced a product with an ash of 10 – 11 % leaving behind reject with an ash of 80 % from a feed with an ash of 61 %, providing that the emulsion dosage was sufficient. Overall, the work in this study has resulted in the development of a rapid agglomeration process with reduced organic reagent requirements.

50|$|Amylose {{is also an}} {{important}} thickener, water <b>binder,</b> <b>emulsion</b> stabilizer, and gelling agent in both industrial and food-based contexts. Loose helical amylose chains have a hydrophobic interior that can bind to hydrophobic molecules such as lipids and aromatic compounds. The one problem with this is that, when it crystallizes or associates, it can lose some stability, often releasing water in the process (syneresis). When amylose concentration is increased, gel stickiness decreases but gel firmness increases. When other things including amylopectin bind to amylose, the viscosity can be affected, but incorporating κ-carrageenan, alginate, xanthan gum, or low-molecular-weight sugars can reduce the loss in stability. The ability to bind water can add substance to food, possibly serving as a fat replacement. For example, amylose is responsible for causing white sauce to thicken, but, upon cooling, some separation between the solid and the water will occur.|$|R

The sweep tests was intended to investigate the change of bonding properties between emulsion asphalt and aggregate with curing time. The Vialit Plate Shock test was used to evaluate the bonding properties of chip seal materials at low temperatures. RESULTS:Results from sweep tests showed that polymer modified emulsion asphalt can reduce the curing time by 1. 5 hour comparing with typical emulsion asphalt. It is also found that the Flakiness Index of aggregates and absorption rate of binder are the major factors affecting the bonding properties of chip seal materials. The Vialit Plate Shock test results showed that the average aggregate loss of CRS- 2 is ten times higher than CRS- 2 P No. 2 indicating that the use of polymer additives in emulsion asphalt can improve the performance of chip seal materials in low temperature region.

Cold recycling technologies utilizing <b>emulsion</b> as <b>binder</b> demonstrates a number of high environmental advantages and thus it is widely applied worldwide. There are many factors influencing the performance of emulsion recycled asphalt mixture, such as components, curing, aging etc. This study investigates the influence of proportion of virgin aggregate and curing time {{on the performance of}} recycled mixture. The mixture formulation design at three levels of virgin aggregate addition (0 %, 10 % and 20 %) and one dosage of cement (1. 5 %) has been conducted. The performance of emulsion recycled asphalt mixture including splitting failure load, splitting failure strength and Freeze-thaw splitting strength has been measured at four curing times (0 day, 7 days, 14 days and 28 days). The effect of proportion of virgin aggregate and curing time on the performance of recycled mixture has been quantified accordingly. The research has manifested that the increment of the proportion of virgin aggregate and the curing time will enhance the performance of the emulsified asphalt cold recycled mixture up to 26 %.

The poorer performance of the materials associated with expensive cold mixes will results in greater overall cost for patching due to increased cost of labour, equipment and traffic control. The main objective of this study was to evaluate performance of proprietary cold mix asphalts available in South Africa. Five products were used in this study, which are Roadfix, Tarfix, Much- Asphalt mix, Asphalt King and Glenpatch. Engineering properties of products were investigated, including volumetric properties, permeability and Indirect Tensile Strength. In addition, for performance properties, accelerated pavement testing using Model Mobil Load Simulator (MMLS 3) was carried out. The testing was done dry at 50 o C up 20, 000 load repetitions. It was found out that all five products have high void contents which range between 15. 1 % and 23. 5 %. This makes these cold mix asphalts to be highly permeable.

40|$|The {{interlayer}} bonding {{of modern}} multi-layered pavement system {{plays an important}} role to achieve long term performance of a flexible pavement. It has been observed that poor bonding between bituminous pavement layers contributes to major pavement overlay distresses such as premature fatigue, top down cracking, potholes, and surface layer delamination. One of the most common distresses due to poor bonding between bituminous layers is a slippage failure, which usually occurs where heavy vehicles are often accelerating, decelerating, or turning. To enhance the bonding between layers, a tack coat is sprayed in between the bituminous pavement layers. A tack coat is an application of a bituminous <b>emulsion</b> or bituminous <b>binder</b> between an existing bituminous / concrete surface and a newly constructed bituminous overlay. Normally, hot bituminous binders, cutback bitumens or bituminous emulsions are used as tack coat materials. This study is aimed to evaluate the bond strength at the interface between pavement layers by performing laboratory tests. To carry out this objective, three special attachments are fabricated for use in Marshall Loading Frame for finding the performance of tack coat laid at the interface between Bituminous Concrete (BC) and Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM) layers in the laboratory. In this study, the results of the specimens prepared with 100 mm and 150 mm diameter specimens using two types of normally used emulsions, namely CMS- 2 and CRS- 1 as tack coat at application rates varying at 0. 20 kg/m 2, 0. 25 kg/m 2 and 0. 30 kg/m 2 made at 250 C temperature are presented. It is observed that CRS- 1 as tack coat provides higher interface bond strength value compared to CMS- 2. Similarly, irrespective of the types of emulsions used as tack coat, the optimum rate of application is found to be 0. 25 kg/m 2 as recommended in MORT&H’s specifications.

40|$|Cold Bituminous Emulsion Mixtures (BEMs) means {{manufacturing}} {{of asphalt}} {{at ambient temperature}} using bitumen <b>emulsion</b> as the <b>binder.</b> It has been widely utilised in many countries such as the USA and France. The use and development of BEMs were not brought forward in the UK due to the country’s relatively wet/cold climatic conditions, which are not favourable to the application of cold BEM {{in terms of the}} long curing process and low early strength. Decreasing wastes from aggregate production processes, reducing land-filling and reducing CO 2 emissions during hot bituminous mixture production and laying are the main target schemes for the environmentally friendly processes. Cold BEM is one of the attractive methods of producing bituminous mixtures to tackle the mentioned disadvantages when incorporating some waste and/or by-product materials individually or collectively into these mixtures. Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in incorporating supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) in production of BEMs in the UK and around the world. Three benefits can be stated when using SCM in BEMs; these are upgraded mechanical properties, gaining economic advantage and the ecological advantage factor. Mainly due to some inherent problems associated with the performance of the pavement produced by the BEMs process, they are regarded as “inferior” to conventional HMA. The major problems with this kind of application are the long curing time (evaporation of trapped water) required to achieve the required performance, the weak early life strength (because of the existence of water) and high air voids content. The full curing in the field of these mixtures may occur between 2 − 24 months depending on the mixture’s ingredients and weather conditions. Considering the above disadvantages, this study investigated the possible ways of developing a new BEM/s with gap graded mixtures similar to the conventional Hot Rolled Asphalt (HRA) gradation. HRA is extensively used for surfacing major roads in the UK because it provides a dense, impervious layer, resulting in a weather-resistant durable surface able to endure the demands of today’s traffic loads and providing good resistance to fatigue cracking. The mentioned new product is termed Cold Rolled Asphalt (CRA). The main aim {{of this study was to}} investigate producing high strength, fast curing and sustainable CRA mixtures for heavily trafficked road and highway surfacing layers by using different waste and by-product materials (normally used as SCM) individually and/or collectively as a replacement for conventional mineral filler. To achieve the above aim, four SCMs have been used which were: Waste Paper Sludge Ash (WPSA), which has high lime and gelenite content, Poultry Litter Fly Ash (PLFA), which has high alkali components, Silica Fume (SF), and Rice Husk Ash (RHA), which is high silica content and cost-plus material, collectively instead of conventional mineral filler. In addition, besides the production of the new high-quality CRA mixtures, the research includes a detailed comparison study of conventional HRA mixtures, CRA mixtures containing conventional mineral filler and CRA mixtures containing hydraulic filler, i. e. Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC). This laboratory study was conducted by utilising different types of testing and curing and conditioning methods to characterise the mechanical properties and durability of the produced CRA mixtures. Indirect Tensile Stiffness Modulus (ITSM), Uniaxial Compression Cyclic Test (UCCT), Four Point Bending fatigue test on prismatic shaped specimens (4 PB) and Semi-Circular Bending monotonic test (SCB) were used to assess the mechanical properties of these mixtures while Stiffness Modulus Ratio (SMR) and Long Term Oven Aging (LTOA) were used to investigate the main durability features, i. e. water sensitivity and long-term aging, respectively. Furthermore, Scan Electron Microscopy (SEM) technique and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis have been used to investigate the reasons behind the improvement in the mechanical properties of the novel mixtures. By means of ITSM results, four high-qualities CRA mixtures have been optimised which are: CRA-WPSA (containing 6...|$|R
