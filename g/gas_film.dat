We studied tolerance of complete submergence in saline water for Melilotus siculus, an annual legume with superhydrophobic leaf surfaces that retain <b>gas</b> <b>films</b> when under water. M. siculus survived complete submergence of 1 week at low salinity (up to 50 molm- 3 NaCl), {{but did not}} recover following de-submergence from 100 molm- 3 NaCl. The leaf <b>gas</b> <b>films</b> protected against direct salt ingress into the leaves when submerged in saline water, enabling underwater photosynthesis even after 3 d of complete submergence. By contrast, leaves with the <b>gas</b> <b>films</b> experimentally removed suffered from substantial Na+ and Cl- intrusion and lost the capacity for underwater photosynthesis. Similarly, plants in saline water and without <b>gas</b> <b>films</b> lost more K+ than those with intact <b>gas</b> <b>films.</b> This study has demonstrated that leaf <b>gas</b> <b>films</b> reduce Na+ and Cl- ingress into leaves when submerged by saline water - the thin gas layer physically separates the floodwater from the leaf surface.

The ceramics would have allowed temperatures of over 3000 °F (1650 °C).

The expected increase of fuel efficiency of the engine (caused by the higher temperature, as shown by Carnot's theorem) could not be verified experimentally; {{it was found that}} the heat transfer on the hot ceramic cylinder walls was higher than the transfer to a cooler metal wall as the cooler <b>gas</b> <b>film</b> on the metal surface works as a thermal insulator. Thus, despite all of these desirable properties, such engines have not succeeded in production because of costs for the ceramic components and the limited advantages. (Small imperfections in the ceramic material with its low fracture toughness lead to cracks, which can lead to potentially dangerous equipment failure.) Such engines are possible in laboratory settings, but mass production is not feasible with current technology.|$|E

Further development and improvement of the different applications of electrochemical discharges require a better understanding of this process. Beyond the critical voltage, an insulating <b>gas</b> <b>film</b> forms around the electrode and discharges take place through the <b>gas</b> <b>film.</b> The stability of the <b>gas</b> <b>film</b> affects the quality of the discharges. The <b>gas</b> <b>film</b> formation is therefore investigated in the present thesis. The main objective of the current project is to attain a better insight into the <b>gas</b> <b>film</b> dynamics. This goal is achieved through the following approaches: 1. The current-voltage characteristics are studied prior to the <b>gas</b> <b>film</b> formation and then compared with a model developed based on the percolation theory. 2.

40|$|Mechanical face seals are {{designed}} {{to benefit from the}} relative Downloaded Frotation between the faces allowed by the flexibility in the stator mounting. Relative rotation between the faces results in self-actuating hydrodynamic pressure, which creates a stiff barrier be-tween the seal faces that actively deters face contact. Furthermore, the <b>gas</b> <b>film</b> dissipates energy by internal friction and viscous shearing, which helps to reduce vibrations that result from exter-nal disturbances. When designed properly, the <b>gas</b> <b>film</b> dynamic stiffness and damping properties can be beneficial, but they can also be detrimental if the seal is designed improperly. An example of an improperly designed seal is one where the <b>gas</b> <b>film</b> stiffness and damping contribute to a natural resonance close to an operat-ing frequency.

40|$|Abstract Submergence impedes plant gas {{exchange}} with the environment. Survival depends upon internal aeration to provide O 2 throughout the plant body, although short-term anoxia can be tolerated. During nights, plants rely on O 2 entry from the floodwater and pO 2 in roots declines {{so that some}} tissues become severely hypoxic or even anoxic. Underwater photosynthesis is the main daytime O 2 source and also provides sugars. Capacity for photosynthesis under water, like in air, is determined by available CO 2 and light; however, slow diffusion in water often limits CO 2 supply. Underwater photosynthesis in some wetland species is enhanced by <b>gas</b> <b>films</b> on superhydrophobic leaf surfaces. Leaf <b>gas</b> <b>films</b> also increase night-time O 2 uptake by submerged plants. Flooding events are forecast to increase and understanding of plant submergence tolerance should enable predictions of possible impacts on vegetation communities and also aid breeding of improved submergence tolerance in rice. 1 The Submergence Environment The slow diffusion of gases in water compared with in air presents a challenge to submerged terrestrial plants (Armstrong 1979) as oxygen (O 2) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) uptake are greatly impeded. Diffusion of gases in water is approximately 10, 000 -fold slower than in air, so that since the diffusive boundary layers (DBLs...|$|R
