40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} to determine anionic surfactants in river water using Teflon (PTFE) <b>filter</b> <b>tube</b> preconcentration. PTFE adsorbs hydrophobic and electrically neutral chemical species on its surface. This allows the surface of PTFE <b>filter</b> <b>tube</b> to adsorb and concentrate an ion pair formed between a cationic detecting agent and an anionic surfactant in aqueous solution. The detecting agent and the model anionic surfactant used were Co- 5 -Cl-PADAP, a highly sensitive detecting agent, and sodium dodecyl sulfate, respectively. After the ion pair was concentrated at a flow rate of 1. 5 mL/min for 5 min on a 7 cm long <b>filter</b> <b>tube</b> (inner diameter: 1. 5 mm), the ion pair was eluted with ethanol at a flow rate of 2. 0 mL/min.

This method and the Ethyl Violet method (EV method, JIS) gave somewhat different analytical results for a standard solution containing various anionic surfactants because the sensitivities of the methods are different for each surfactant, while they yielded the same analytical results for river water samples...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the lateral}} size {{reduction}} of stored bits {{on a hard}} disk, the head-to-med ia spacing has to be reduced {{as well as the}} thickness of the protecting carbon overcoats. In order to obtain a thickness in the 2 nm region a new process technology is needed. In the present paper, a high current pulsed arc (HCA) technique is presented as an innovative source for ultra thin carbon coating for industrial disk production. The hardness and scratching resistance of these films are remarkably higher than conventional magnetron sputtered films. With the HCA-Source we are able to produce pinhole-free carbon films with thicknesses down to 1. 7 nm. The thickness profile and uniformity on disk is adjustable by a magnetic field array. The deposition rate is 0. 070. 3 nm per pulse, therefore the coating time is below 2 s per disk. The magnetic layer is left undamaged during the HCA depo sition process. These aspects are very important for industrial disk production efficiency. Strong particle reduction due to a magnetic <b>filter</b> <b>tube</b> is confirmed by repeatable glide tests. Particles are confined in the magnetic <b>filter</b> <b>tube</b> and do not reach the substrate.

40|$|The {{investigations}} {{described in}} this thesis were aimed at developing or laying the foundation of novel techniques of liquid/solid and liquid/liquid separation by utilising the capillary effect. In Part I the studies related to the extraction of water from an agglomerate of particulate solids and water (i. e. dewatering) by means of ceramic elements are described. These studies clearly showed that although water can be extracted from the agglomerate by ceramic elements and evaporated to atmosphere, the rate of extraction is generally too low for commercial application of the technique. Part II of this thesis deals with the separation of two immiscible liquids (i. e. water and oil) using a ceramic <b>filter</b> <b>tube</b> either as a 'threshold pressure' separator or a coalescer.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that mammographic {{equipment}} is generally provided with a molybdenum (Mo) anode and a molybdenum <b>filter</b> <b>tube.</b> The thickness of the Mo added filtration is about 30 μm; this value was most likely chosen in an empirical way as an acceptable compromise in order to avoid high dose, tube overloading and poor image quality. The improvement of the X-ray tube output due to the introduction of new Mo rotating anode and high frequency voltage generator, together with a faster screen-film system, prompted us to investigate the effect of increasing Mo filtration on dose and image quality. In this paper we analyzed the energy spectra distribution for various kV(p) settings with Mo filtration ranging from 0 to 75 μm. The analysis was performed on either an incident or transmitted beam. The entrance dose, the mean dose, the mean glandular dose and the image quality were also evaluated. The results show that at increasing filter thickness the entrance and the mean dose decrease without losing image quality. In addition, the mean glandular dose appears to be dependent on the kV(p) settings, but is almost independent on Mo filtration...|$|E

40|$|Distinct {{layers of}} iron(III) and manganese(IV) (Fe/Mn) oxides are found buried within the {{reducing}} {{part of the}} sediments in Lake Baikal and cause considerable complexity and steep vertical gradients {{with respect to the}} redox sequence. For the on-site investigation of the responsible biogeochemical processes, we applied <b>filter</b> <b>tube</b> samplers for the extraction of sediment porewater combined with a portable capillary electrophoresis instrument for the analyses of inorganic cations and anions. On the basis of the new results, the sequence of diagenetic processes leading to the formation, transformation, and dissolution of the Fe/Mn layers was investigated. With two exemplary cores we demonstrate that the dissolution of particulate Fe and Mn is coupled to the anaerobic oxidation of CH 4 (AOM) either via the reduction of sulphate (SO 42 -) and the subsequent generation of Fe(II) by S(-II) oxidation, or directly coupled to Fe reduction. Dissolved Fe(II) diffuses upwards to reduce particulate Mn(IV) thus forming a sharp mineral boundary. An alternative dissolution pathway is indicated by the occurrence of anaerobic nitrification of NH 4 + observed at locations with Mn(IV). Furthermore, the reasons and consequences of the non-steady-state sediment pattern and the resulting redox discontinuities are discussed and a suggestion for the burial of active Fe/Mn layers is presented...|$|E

Materials and Methods. We used an anthropomorphic chest phantom with eight artificial GGNs with two different CT attenuations and four different volumes. CT scans were obtained with four models of CT scanner at 120 kVp and 25 mAs with a soft and a sharp reconstruction filter. On the 256 -MDCT scanner, the tube current-exposure time product and tube voltage settings were varied. GGNs were measured with software that automatically segmented the nodules. Absolute percentage error (APE) was calculated for volume, mass, and density. Wilcoxon signed rank, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for analysis. Results. Volume and mass did not differ significantly from the true values. Whe n measurements were expressed as A PE, the error range was 2 - 36 % for volume and 5 - 46 % rom no error.

40|$|The projectional {{nature of}} {{radiogram}} limits its {{amount of information}} about the instrumented spine. MRI and CT imaging can be more helpful, using cross-sectional view. However, the presence of metal-related artifacts at both conventional CT and MRI imaging can obscure relevant anatomy and disease. We reviewed the literature about overcoming artifacts from metallic orthopaedic implants at high-field strength MRI imaging and multi-detector CT. The evolution of multichannel CT has made available new techniques that can help minimizing the severe beam-hardening artifacts. The presence of artifacts at CT from metal hardware is related to image reconstruction algorithm (<b>filter),</b> <b>tube</b> current (in mA), X-ray kilovolt peak, pitch, hardware composition, geometry (shape), and location. MRI imaging has been used safely in patients with orthopaedic metallic implants because most of these implants do not have ferromagnetic properties and have been fixed into position. However, on MRI imaging metallic implants may produce geometric distortion, the so-called susceptibility artifact. In conclusion, although 140  kV and high milliamperage second exposures are recommended for imaging patients with hardware, caution should always be exercised, particularly in children, young adults, and patients undergoing multiple examinations. MRI artifacts can be minimized by positioning optimally and correctly the examined anatomy part with metallic implants in the magnet and by choosing fast spin-echo sequences, and in some cases also STIR sequences, with an anterior to posterior frequency-encoding direction and the smallest voxel size...|$|E

Ribosomal RNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes (muD 1, puD 1 and deD 1) specifically reacted to P. multiseries, P. pungens and P. delicatissima, respectively, whereas auD 1, frD 1 and amD 1 probes did not bind to P. multiseries, P. pungens, P. cuspidata, P. multistriata, P. subpacifica, P. subfraudulenta and P. delicatissima. In particular, fluorescent FITC-conjugated WGA specifically bound to P. multiseries {{but not to}} P. pungens, indicating {{that this is a}} desirable method for their rapid and easy discrimination.

The oligonucleotide probe and fluorescent WGA bound specifically to P. multiseries and these labelled cells were correlated to label cell abundance. These results imply that DNA and lectin probes are apporopriate tools for counting P. multiseries and distinguishing morphologically similar Pseudo-nitzschia species in natural samples, therefore, these methods are especially pertinent since rapid separation and quantitative estimation of cell abundance of P. multiseries are now important for a routine harmful algae monitoring program in Korean waters...|$|E

Despite detailed knowledge on the composition and amount of the emitted volatiles in many plant-herbivore systems, it remains largely unknown which compounds are essential for the attraction of natural enemies. In this study, we used a combination of different fractionation methods and olfactometer bioassays {{in order to examine}} the attractiveness of different compositions of volatile blends to females of the parasitoid Cotesia marginiventris. In a first step, we passed a volatile blend emitted by Spodoptera littoralis infested maize seedlings over a silica-containing <b>filter</b> <b>tube</b> and subsequently desorbed the volatiles that were retained by the silica filter (silica extract). The volatiles that broke through the silica filter were collected on and subsequently desorbed from a SuperQ filter (breakthrough). The silica extract was highly attractive to the wasps, whereas the breakthrough volatiles were not attractive. The silica extract was even more attractive than the extract that contained all herbivore-induced maize volatiles. Subsequently, we fractioned the silica extract by preparative gas-chromatography (GC) and by separating more polar from less polar compounds. In general, C. marginiventris preferred polar over non-polar compounds, but several fractions were attractive to the wasp, including one that contained compounds emitted in quantities below the detection threshold of the GC analysis. These results imply that the attractiveness of the volatile blend emitted by Spodoptera -infested maize seedlings to C. marginiventris females is determined by a specific combination of attractive and repellent/masking compounds, including some that are emitted in very small amounts. Manipulating the emission of such minor compounds has the potential to greatly improve the attraction of certain parasitoids and enhance biological control of specific insect pests...|$|E
