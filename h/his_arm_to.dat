5|$|Lavelli {{initially}} {{planned to}} retire in 1955 but came back for a final year in 1956, when the Browns posted a 5–7 record, the team's first-ever losing season. In his 11-year career, Lavelli caught 386 passes for 6,488 yards and 62 touchdowns. He was a confident receiver, former teammates said in later years. He could often be heard calling for Graham to throw him the ball while running routes. He was also known {{for his ability to}} improvise on the field. In a 1955 game against the Eagles in slippery conditions, he caught the winning touchdown with less than a minute left by swinging around the goalpost with <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>to</b> get open.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Dana Scully finds black oil in de la Cruz's skull {{during an}} autopsy—the oil {{is dead and}} {{seems to have been}} irradiated. She concludes that he may have had some {{immunity}} to the black oil because he is a Huecha Indian, or an indigenous Mexican national. Doggett and Mulder find proof of black oil on the platform and quarantine it, but de la Cruz's friend Diego Garza is missing. Ortega threatens to bring back the crew unless the agents can provide proof of an infection. Doggett and Mulder search for Garza who, like de la Cruz, also has Native American heritage. Mulder and Doggett later discover that somebody has set fire to the communications room. As the agents tackle the fire, Garza attacks Doggett and renders him unconscious. When he awakens, Garza, now mentally unstable, cuts <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>to</b> check for the presence of black oil.|$|E

5|$|Mullum Malarum {{is based}} on a novel of the same name by Umachandran which was {{published}} in the Tamil magazine, Kalki. The story, about the love between a brother and sister, won the first prize in Kalkis Novel Short Story Competition celebrating the magazine's 1966 silver jubilee. Screenplay and dialogue writer J. Mahendran read only a part of Umachandran's novel, but was particularly impressed by the winch operator Kali and his affection for his sister, as well as the loss of his arm. He outlined Mullum Malarum to producer Venu Chettiar, who was impressed. Adapting Umachandran's novel for the screen, Mahendran made his directing debut and wrote the film's dialogue. His screenplay diverged from the novel's plot, and he decided to make a minimalist, visually-rich film without melodrama, overacting, excessive dialogue or duets. A significant difference is that in the novel, Kali loses <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>to</b> a tiger while in the film, he loses it due to it being run over by a lorry.|$|E
5|$|The two armies met on {{the large}} plain of al-Mudiq (cf. Qalaat al-Madiq), {{surrounded}} by mountains and located near the Lake of Apamea, on 19 July 998. According to Ibn al-Qalanisi, the Fatimid army's left wing was commanded by Maysur the Slav, governor of Tripoli; the centre, where the Daylamite infantry and the army baggage train were located, was {{under the command of}} Badr al-Attar; the right was commanded by Jaysh ibn Samsama and Wahid al-Hilali. According to all accounts, the Byzantines charged the Fatimid army and drove it to flight, killing some 2,000 and capturing the baggage train. Only 500 ghilman under Bishara the Ikhshidid remained steadfast and held firm against the assault, while the Banu Kilab simply abandoned the fight and began looting the battlefield. At that point, a Kurdish rider, named Abu'l-Hajar Ahmad ibn al-Dahhak al-Salil by Ibn al-Athir and Ibn al-Qalanisi and Bar Kefa by the Byzantine sources and Abu'l-Faraj, rode towards Dalassenos, who was near his battle standard on top of a height and was accompanied only by two of his sons and ten men of his retinue. Believing the battle won and that the Kurd wanted to surrender, Dalassenos took no precautions. As he approached the Byzantine general, Ibn al-Dahhak suddenly charged. Dalassenos lifted <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>to</b> shield himself, but the Kurd launched his spear at him. The general wore no cuirass, and the blow killed him.|$|E

25|$|During the off-season, Marquis tweaked his {{delivery}} {{to improve his}} release point by staying over the rubber longer in his balance point, allowing <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>to</b> catch up, resulting in a 2 to 3inches longer stride, and leaving him {{on top of the}} ball and throwing downhill. Reporters attributed his first-half success to his new delivery and his high ground ball ratio.|$|E
25|$|Ever a student, Biederwolf was a {{firm believer}} in serious reading and {{regularly}} carried a book under <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>to</b> make use of otherwise wasted moments. His sermons were written out word-for-word and memorized, but his delivery was so fluent that listeners were unaware of his preparation. Biederwolf enjoyed athletics (in later life, tennis and golf), and he was a collector of small gemstones, which he prized for their color and light rather than for their intrinsic value. Biederwolf died at his home in Monticello in 1939.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} {{engages in}} the behavior because it produces a decrease in aversive stimulation. Put another way, something aversive is occurring in some location on the organism's body, and engaging {{in the behavior}} decreases the level of discomfort. For example, a child bangs {{his head against the}} wall to decrease the pain experienced from a toothache. Another example includes a child scratching <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>to</b> decrease the level of itchiness experienced from a bug bite. Common forms of aversive stimulation abated by engaging in specific behaviors include sinus pain, itching, hunger, etc.|$|E

25|$|A coroner's inquest was {{conducted}} which {{concluded that the}} IWW strike leadership had caused the riot {{which led to the}} death of District Attorney Manwell. Arrest warrants were hastily issued for Ford and Suhr on charges of murder. The pair were soon detained, as were their fellow workers Walter Bagan and William Beck, all of whom were held over for trial. The physical pressure was so severe that Nels Nelson, the picker who lost <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>to</b> a gunshot wound, hanged himself to death in his cell. Another prisoner unsuccessfully attempted to do the same. A third prisoner suffered a breakdown and had to be committed to a mental hospital.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, British {{obstetrician}} Dr. James Blundell made efforts to treat hemorrhage by transfusion of human blood using a syringe. In 1818 following experiments with animals, he performed {{the first successful}} transfusion of human blood to treat postpartum hemorrhage. Blundell used the patient's husband as a donor, and extracted four ounces of blood from <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>to</b> transfuse into his wife. During the years 1825 and 1830, Blundell performed 10 transfusions, five of which were beneficial, and published his results. He also invented a number of instruments for the transfusion of blood. He made {{a substantial amount of}} money from this endeavour, roughly $2 million ($50 million real dollars).|$|E
25|$|Han-Pashi (also {{known as}} 'Khan'), an avid scholar of the Koran, was the elder of Nur-Pashi's two brothers. He was {{drafted into the}} Russian Army in 1991 and served the {{standard}} two-year term. He later fought in the First Chechen War {{on the side of}} the Chechen rebels. During the Second Chechen War, Han-Pashi once again joined the ranks of the Chechen militants. In August 2001, he was shot in his right arm during a confrontation at an army checkpoint, and claims to have been tortured afterwards. The gunshot wound required <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>to</b> be amputated. He was convicted of being a member of the Chechen militants, but was granted amnesty on 18 December 2001, after which he moved into an Ingush apartment with Nur-Pashi.|$|E

25|$|The MCC had a {{more enjoyable}} time at Lismore, New South Wales, near the border with Queensland. Unlike Newcastle {{this was in the}} open {{countryside}} and the players took advantage of the town's generous hospitality and the free membership of the local golf courses. David Sheppard (52), Reg Simpson (66) and John Dewes (50) made some easy runs in the MCC's 274 on the first day. One of the umpires so forgot himself that he led the appeals against the MCC captain when he was rapped on the pads then raised <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>to</b> give him out lbw. The English bowlers shared the wickets in the Northern NSW's reply of 156. A hundred runs ahead Freddie Brown enforced the follow on, but the last afternoon was played easily and they did not press for victory after having the local team made 21/2 and they finished a happily played game on 55/2.|$|E
25|$|Parma's next {{engagement}} was {{the weekend}} opener against league leaders Milan {{in front of}} a crowd approaching 20,000. The away side had a host of absentees, including Robinho, Mark van Bommel, Ignazio Abate, Kevin-Prince Boateng and Alessandro Nesta, while Parma were still without Galloppa, although Mirante returned in goal. Early on, Giovinco was lively, incorrectly offside in a good position, before blasting over following a Christian Abbiati error, but it was Milan that opened the scoring after winning a penalty when Cristian Zaccardo inexplicably raised <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>to</b> block Urby Emanuelson’s half-volley shot. Zlatan Ibrahimović scored the penalty after 17 minutes. Parma continued to press and look Milan's equal before and after half-time, but Emanuelson doubled Milan's advantage after his fantastic dribble ended with an easy finish beyond the rounded Mirante. Undeterred, Parma looked for a consolation goal, but it was not forthcoming, which left the Ducali without a win in seven.|$|E
25|$|On January 2, 1972, Gacy {{picked up}} 16-year-old Timothy Jack McCoy from Chicago's Greyhound bus terminal. Gacy took McCoy—who was {{traveling}} from Michigan to Omaha—on a sightseeing tour of Chicago, and then {{drove him to}} his home with the promise that he could spend the night and be driven back to the station {{in time to catch}} his bus. According to Gacy's later account of the murder, he awoke the following morning to find McCoy standing in his bedroom doorway with a kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy leapt from his bed and McCoy raised both arms in a gesture of surrender, tilting the knife upwards and accidentally cutting Gacy's forearm (Gacy had a scar on <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>to</b> support this account). He then twisted the knife from McCoy's wrist, banged his head against his bedroom wall, kicked him against his wardrobe and walked towards him. McCoy then kicked him in the stomach and Gacy grabbed the youth, wrestled him to the floor, then stabbed him repeatedly in the chest as he straddled him with his body. Gacy claimed he then went to his kitchen and saw an opened carton of eggs and a slab of unsliced bacon on his kitchen table. McCoy had also set the table for two; he had walked into Gacy's room to wake him while absentmindedly carrying the kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy subsequently buried McCoy in his crawl space and later covered the youth's grave with a layer of concrete.|$|E

500|$|Large organs {{such as the}} one {{installed}} in 1361 in Halberstadt, Germany, the first documented permanent organ installation, likely prompted Guillaume de Machaut to describe the organ as [...] "the king of instruments", a characterization still frequently applied. The Halberstadt organ was the first instrument to use a chromatic key layout across its three manuals and pedalboard, although the keys were wider than on modern instruments. It had twenty bellows operated by ten men, and the wind pressure was so high that the player had to use the full strength of <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>to</b> hold down a key.|$|E
500|$|Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles {{realize they}} must work as one unit to defeat Adam. They are {{captured}} sneaking into the Initiative, but Adam trips the power, releasing all the demons and a fight breaks {{out all over}} the facility. Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles get themselves into a room adjacent to 314 as Willow starts to cast the spell to join them all temporarily. Riley distracts Adam's demonoid minions while Buffy confronts Adam. However, Adam, after modulating <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>to</b> dispense a minigun, is able to overpower her. Suddenly, the spell begins to work: to function as one unit, Willow becomes the spirit, Giles the mind, Xander the heart, and Buffy the hand, or strength of their ensemble. They work through Buffy to neutralize Adam, telling him [...] "You could never hope to grasp the source of our power". Adam, alone but intrigued, shoots at them to no avail. Adam then shoots a missile, which is changed into doves, and his gun is reverted into his arm. They are able, through Buffy, to punch inside Adam's chest, remove his uranium core, destroying him.|$|E
500|$|The {{video is}} set in a forest; Jackson, in scruffy clothes, sings [...] "Childhood" [...] while sitting on a tree stump. The camera moves up the trees into the night sky and flying {{airships}} travel overhead. On board the ships, children are seen playing a variety of games as they travel further away from Jackson, towards the moon. Other children appear in the forest undergrowth before floating up towards the airships, but Jackson remains seated on the tree stump. Although the concept of the video had little in common with the corresponding film, Free Willy 2, two of its actors-Jason James Richter and Francis Capra-appear in the video. Richter appears halfway through, leading the armada of airships. Capra appears {{near the end of the}} video alongside Jackson as he watches the airships above. Richter looks down and sees him and extends <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>to</b> bring him up to the airship as Capra floats upward toward it. Erika Christensen and Jena Malone also appeared in the video playing baseball. The video for [...] "Childhood" [...] is 4:27 minutes long. In the publication, Doug Pratt's DVD: Movies, Television, Music, Art, Adult, and More!, Pratt describes the video as [...] "outstanding, a Chris Van Allsburg-style vision of children in flying airships, crusading through a forest at night".|$|E
