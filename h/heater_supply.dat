40|$|A hollow cathode-based plasma {{contactor}} is baselined on International Space Station Alpha (ISSA) for spacecraft charge control. The plasma contactor system {{consists of}} a hollow cathode assembly (HCA), a power electronics unit (PEU), and an expellant management unit (EMU). The plasma contactor has recently been required to operate in a cyclic mode to conserve xenon expellant and extend system life. Originally, a DC cathode heater converter was baselined for a continuous operation mode because only a few ignitions of the hollow cathode were expected. However, for cyclic operation, a DC <b>heater</b> <b>supply</b> can potentially result in hollow cathode heater component failure due to the DC electrostatic field. This can prevent the heater from attaining the proper cathode tip temperature for reliable ignition of the hollow cathode.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a part of the CLEMPS (Closed Loop Embedded MEMS-based Precision Stage) project. Within this project a MEMS-stage should be {{positioned}} using a feedback (displacement) signal with 10 -nm accuracy over a 100 ?m range. This thesis investigates if thermal sensing can be used as a reliable sensing mechanism within the CLEMPS project. Lantz et al demonstrated a promising thermal displacement sensor that achieves nanometre resolution on a 100 ?m range [1]. Using this sensor as a basis, five conceptual designs for thermal displacement sensors are introduced, of which one concept operates in vacuum and four concepts operate in a normal environment. Basic analysis showed that each conceptual design is feasible, except for thermal sensing in vacuum. The designs have large variety in fabrication complexity and estimated performance. The behaviour of the sensors is strongly nonlinear due to dependencies of the material properties on temperature. Different thermo electrical models are introduced that quantify the performance of the designs. Those models are used to gain extensive insight in the behaviour of the sensors and to provide comparison between the performances of the different sensor designs. The models are also applied as design tool for investigating the influence of geometric variations on the sensing performance. Only two of the designs are compatible with the available SOI-wafer based processing. These sensor designs were actually fabricated and integrated within an actuated MEMS stage. For experimental evaluation of the general feasibility of thermal displacement sensing, the thesis focuses on the simplest design. An electronic measurement circuit is designed and fabricated that provides the actuator voltages and performs the differential current-to-voltage amplification for the measurement signal. The mechanical behaviour of the stage is experimentally characterized to determine the relation between the actuator voltage and stage displacement. Now, the (quasi-) static measurement performance of the fabricated sensor can be experimentally characterized by actuating the stage at a low frequency, while recording the applied actuator voltage, the resulting individual heater currents and the differential measurement current in xPC. This data is analysed to obtain the sensor performance in terms of offset, sensitivity, nonlinearity, noise and power consumption. The static measurements are repeated on many sensors to investigate the repeatability and influence of geometric variations. The influence of varying conditions in terms of <b>heater</b> <b>supply</b> voltage, environmental temperature and humidity is determined by performing many characterizations on one device using controlled measurement conditions. Also, the dynamic performance is evaluated in terms of sensor drift, frequency behaviour and hysteresis of the device by using supplementary measurements The feasibility of thermal displacement sensing within the CLEMPS is evaluated using the results on the sensor performance for design IV. Using acquired insight, the performance limiting effects are identified and recommendations for improvements are presented.

At the time of the test, the desired adhesive for gluing the two halves of the channel together was not available. Therefore, 5 -minute epoxy was used on the inner and outer diameters of the halves. Tape was used to set the gap between the two halves. This form of attachment does not make a strong bond between the two halves so the differential pressure between the inside and the outside of the channel was limited to a couple of psi.

Process heater is used in Baking, Drying, Laminating, Metal Working, Packaging, Plastic Welding, Preheating, Sealing, Soldering, Shrink Fitting, Synthetic Fabric Sewing and in other industries.

On the other hand, thermal baseboards with integrated ventilation air supply showed better ability to neutralize cold downdraught at the same height and conditions. Calculations also showed that the heat output from the integrated system with one ventilation inlet was approximately twiceas high as that of the conventional one.
