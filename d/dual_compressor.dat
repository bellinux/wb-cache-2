Beforehand we have proposed {{the reduction of the}} power consumption used in “actual” air-conditioner operating load is low, and we have produced Dual rotary compressor can make only one of two compression units run (in the following, refer as “Dual system”) and provide high efficiency since 2004 and have made still better of it 1). This time we developed another Dual rotary compressor with a new mechanism. To put Dual system in practice, the compression units have one of two vanes pushed into and pulled apart its roller depending on conditions. As compared with the conventional <b>dual</b> <b>compressor</b> has the way of controlling pressure in the cylinder in order to balance pressure of the compression unit inside with that of the case inside and rear of the vane, the new one has the different method of doing so.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} generic equipment {{models that}} capture {{the performance of}} families of similar heat pumps equipment {{and that can be}} used in building simulation programs. Mapping has been carried out for families of single and <b>dual</b> <b>compressor</b> speed ducted split systems and the correlations are being implemented as components for building simulation. The units mapped ranged in nominal capacity from 1 to 5 tons (3. 5 - 17. 6 kW) and 2 tons to 5 tons (7. 0 - 17. 6 kW) for the single and dual speed units, respectively. Equipment models for building simulation were generated based on the ASHRAE secondary toolkit direct expansion model. Single sets of correction factor equations were found for each family in heating mode and cooling mode by first aggregating normalized performance data of all the units in each family and then mapping the normalized performance characteristics using the ASHRAE toolkit model (Brandemuehl, 1993). The dual speed unit model was split into two parts; one set of coefficients for low speed and another for high compressor speed. These models are based on modern equipment currently on the market and provide a useful update to the currently available standard direct expansion air conditioner models in building simulation programs. The generalized models generated in this study were compared to established performance models based on the ASHRAE toolkit model for cooling and the DOE 2. 1 RESYS routine for heating mode operation...|$|E
40|$|Space {{conditioning}} {{accounts for}} {{a large portion of}} the energy usage in residential buildings. The use of reversible heat pumps has been increasing recently as an efficient method of meeting both heating and cooling loads. With more stringent energy efficiency standards on the horizon and the introduction of ductless heat pumps into the North American market as higher efficiency alternatives to conventional ducted split systems, there is a need for accurate and representative heat pump models to aid in equipment selection and LEED certification. ^ This thesis presents generic equipment models that capture the performance of families of similar heat pump equipment and that can be used in building simulation programs. Mapping has been carried out for families of single and <b>dual</b> <b>compressor</b> speed ducted split systems and the correlations have been implemented as components for building simulation. The units mapped ranged in nominal cooling capacity from 1 to 5 tons (3. 5 – 17. 6 kW) and 2 tons to 5 tons (7. 0 – 17. 6 kW) for the single and dual speed units, respectively. A family of ducted variable speed heat pumps was also mapped ranging in nominal cooling capacity from 3 to 5 tons (10. 6 – 17. 7 kW). ^ Ducted equipment models for building simulation were generated based on the ASHRAE secondary toolkit direct expansion model. All ducted heat pump models were generated using data from a detailed component based simulation. ^ The generalized ducted single speed heat pump models generated in this study were first compared to established performance models based on the ASHRAE toolkit model for cooling and the DOE- 2. 1 RESYS routine for heating mode. It was found that using default coefficients can lead to large performance prediction errors, particularly at conditions away from the equipment rating conditions. ^ Finally, a decoupled model of a ductless heat pump with two indoor units was developed from experimental data for both heating and cooling operation. The ductless heat pump had a nominal cooling capacity of 2 tons (7. 0 kW). The decoupled modeling approach models each of the major components of the system, namely the heat exchangers and the compressor. This approach reduces the number of tests required to characterize the system since component models from tested combinations of indoor and outdoor units can be used to predict performance of untested combinations. ...|$|E

An {{inexpensive}} {{drive circuit}} {{to operate a}} moving magnet type linear motor compressor up to 100 W power is described. It is a Pulse-Width Modulated (PWM-based) circuit with provisions to adjust the frequency, modulation index of the sine wave, frequency of the carrier wave, etc. It is a simple circuit without any need for software development, as discrete electronic components {{are used in the}} circuit, and no microcontroller is used. Power MOSFETs are used in the H bridge circuit for driving the linear motor with opto-coupler isolation to eliminate any EMI interference from the motor to the gate circuit.

40|$|Subsea {{processing}} {{has grown}} into a common vision for the industry known as All subsea. Process solutions presented take a big step towards this vision, and will be a significant extension from today s solutions. The systems developed are able to process hydrocarbons from the wells into products with acceptable specification for transportation and further processing in a downstream system. The processes solutions includes liquid stabilisation, gas cricondenbar/cricondenterm control, and gas dehydration. In addition there is a brief evaluation of subsea heat and power production. Earlier research shows that partial stabilisation provides a significant simplification of the system, and a reduction in power consumption. This is confirmed by analysis presented in of this master thesis. The majority of process solutions presented in this study are therefore based on partial stabilisation. Further development of process solutions is done based on conventional topside processing and the two-stage subsea solution developed by Kraabøl (2015). The configuration of the recompression system for flash gas from the stabilisation process, is found to have significant impact on system complexity, and has been in centre of design. An assessment of equipment is presented, where ejectors and screw compressors where found suitable for flash gas recompression. Centrifugal compressors and pumps are found suitable for export of products. Use of absorption, adsorption, selective membrane, and expansion/cooling is evaluated for gas dehydration. The recommended solution is to use a glycol absorption system. The system has two co-current contactors with downstream separators. This system is robust and provides the lowest glycol circulation rate of the systems analysed. Lean glycol is imported from a host, and exported back as rich glycol for regeneration, to reduce complexity and power consumption subsea. In the end a system using <b>dual</b> screw <b>compressors,</b> with high operational flexibility is recommended. This system is able to operate with both lean and rich feeds, and can be also be used on an unmanned topside installation. For lean feeds, having a relatively low flash gas rate, a very simple, robust, and compact system, including a high pressure separator and dual ejectors can be used. The drawback is that this system cannot operate with rich well streams...|$|R

Cryocoolers are used for various {{applications}} like, cooling of infra red detectors, cryo surgical knife, cryogen recondenser etc. In this thesis the design development and testing of Twin Pulse Tube Cryocooler (TPTC) are discussed. TPTC consists of two pulse tubes driven by dual piston head linear <b>compressor.</b> This <b>dual</b> piston linear <b>compressor</b> is operated using single linear motor. Using this configuration, cooling power is doubled with reduced cost of compressor. The design, fabrication and testing of Linear Moving Magnet Synchronous Motor (LMMSM) based dual piston head linear compressor are carried out indigenously. Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis is used for estimating eddy current loss and flux distribution pattern in various mover configurations of the linear motor. The developed fabrication and assembly procedure of linear motor are discussed in detail. The mover of linear motor is supported by using a pair of cross armed C – type flexures. These flexures are designed using FEM and are fabricated indigenously. The flexure pairs are tested for 108 cycles with ± 3 mm stroke length of linear motor before assembling compressor. Linear motor is usually required to be operated at different frequencies. Thus, a variable frequency and variable voltage Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) based power supply is designed using analog circuits like Op-Amps. This cost effective power supply is capable of delivering 27 A at 100 V with frequency range of 25 Hz to 80 Hz continuously. Sage software was used to carry out 1 -D simulation and obtain dimensions of various Pulse Tube Cryocooler (PTC) components. Various pulse tube configurations like Joint Twin PTC, Twin PTC with buffer volume and single PTC with buffer volume were carried out. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Fluent 2 -D analysis was carried out for single PTC with buffer volume. The fabrication and assembly procedure of PTC is discussed in detail. A novel method of heat exchanger fabrication was developed and analyzed using FEM and its performance is tested experimentally. The twin PTC is operated at 34 bar and 48 Hz. A light weight High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) based level sensor is developed to monitor the cryogen level.
