500|$|Mahoney says {{language}} {{serves as}} [...] "a vehicle for corruption", as Dussander tells Bowden horrific {{stories of his}} service at the fictional Death Camp of Patin. Bowden, in listening to the stories, becomes [...] "a vampiric extension of the evil" [...] that Dussander exhibits. The sharing of stories lead both Dussander and Bowden to <b>have</b> <b>nightmares,</b> and for Bowden, the nightmares are [...] "a past that is becoming ever more present". One of the key motifs {{of the film is}} that [...] "a door was opened that could not be shut", referring to Dussander's confession about following orders and being unable to hold back. The motif is also conveyed in the scene in which Bowden forces Dussander to put on a Schutzstaffel uniform and to march to Bowden's commands. Dussander continues marching despite Bowden's insistences to stop, emulating the premise of the poem The Sorcerer's Apprentice in which the untrained apprentice uses magic to enchant brooms and lacks the skill to stop them. The scene is [...] "the figurative and literal turning point in the film".|$|E

Keighley jumped in and asked [...] "What {{do you want to do}} with Silent Hill?" [...] Kojima responded: [...] "A guy [...] that is such a chicken and is so easily scared – making a scary game – I'm very confident that something horrifying would come out from that.

2500|$|Significant {{speculation}} arose {{regarding a}} potential 2012 presidential bid by Thune.

[...] One Wall Street Journal article stated that Thune possesses [...] "name ID in {{the parts of the}} first caucus state of Iowa that get neighboring South Dakota media, a $6.9 million bank account he could use for a presidential run, and a national fundraising list of 100,000 names from his race against [...] Daschle." [...] DNC Executive Director Jennifer O'Malley Dillon publicly stated that [...] "among a field of generally flawed (in one way or another) Republican presidential candidates, there is one who genuinely scares her. [...] 'This is personal but John Thune is somebody that I <b>have</b> <b>nightmares</b> about,' she said. [...] 'I've worked for Tim Johnson and Tom Daschle and he is just a guy you can't ever count out.'" [...] According to multiple commentators, a Thune candidacy could be helped by his personal appearance (he [...] "looks like a president"). On February 22, 2011, however, Thune announced he would not run in the presidential election in 2012. During the summer of 2012, the USA Today reported that [...] "South Dakota's Thune is on short list for vice president," [...] but Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan was instead selected. Thune engendered some speculation that he might run in the 2016 presidential election, but he declined to run, stating that his [...] "window...might have closed in 2012." ...|$|E
