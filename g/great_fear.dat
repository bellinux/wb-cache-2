5|$|In 1789, the bailliage (bailiwick) of Metz elected Custine to the Estates-General; {{upon his}} election, he {{resigned}} his military commission, judging that his responsibilities {{in the national}} assembly required his full attention. In July 1789, as the French Revolution gained momentum, he remained in the National Constituent Assembly. There, he supported {{the creation of a}} constitution espousing the principles of representative government and often voted with such liberal (constitutional) nobility as the Marquis de Lafayette. Although he supported the abolition of some seigniorial rights, he strongly defended royal prerogative and the rights of the nobility who fled during the <b>Great</b> <b>Fear,</b> especially their rights of property. He offered limited support of the nineteen decrees that abolished game-laws, seigniorial courts, the purchase and sale of posts in the magistracy, pecuniary immunities, favoritism in taxation, surplice money, first-fruits, pluralities, and unmerited pensions.|$|E

25|$|Research {{has found}} that sleep {{paralysis}} is associated with <b>great</b> <b>fear</b> and fear of impending death in 50% of sufferers in Egypt. A study comparing rates and characteristics of sleep paralysis in Egypt and Denmark, found that the phenomenon is three times more common in Egypt versus Denmark. In Denmark, unlike Egypt, there are no elaborate supernatural beliefs about sleep paralysis, and the experience is often interpreted as an odd physiological event, with overall shorter sleep paralysis episodes and fewer people (17%) fearing that they could die from it.|$|E
25|$|Because of this, volunteers had {{to travel}} across Yugoslavia, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Norway and Sweden {{to make their way}} to Finland. They {{travelled}} without any weapons by a special train, officially classified as “tourists going to ski-camp”. The battalion was embarked at Edinburgh to Bergen {{as a part of a}} convoy. This convoy had to be protected by air and naval cover because the United Kingdom and the German Reich were in a state of war and there was <b>great</b> <b>fear</b> of German attacks (“Phony War”). Finally the battalion arrived in Finland on 2 March after three weeks' travelling.|$|E

25|$|As the {{magnitude}} of the disaster became more fully known, Philip reluctantly cancelled the enterprise on 13 November. The disaster was ruinous in terms of finance as the ships La Capitana de Levante and Santiago, each transporting the paychests of 30,000 ducats, were lost. The Armada was to winter in Spain and to depart the following spring without further diversions or postponements. A <b>great</b> <b>fear</b> then gripped Galicia in January 1597 in that the English navy would possibly show up at any moment, a situation similar to that in 1589. The Armada was rebuilt in El Ferrol with the help of replacement artillery and monies recovered from the shipwrecks. The Spanish authorities however were more concerned with defending the peninsula at this time.|$|E
25|$|The joint army of France and the United Provinces, then {{numbering}} 50,000 men, {{composed by}} French, Dutch, German and English soldiers, marched to Tienen, defended {{by a small}} garrison under Captain Martín de los Alarcos. The town was taken by assault, looted for three days, and finally razed. The Spanish garrison {{and most of its}} inhabitants were massacred. This event gave Ferdinand time to improve the fortifications of Leuven and to camp his army in a fortified position next to the city. The Franco-Dutch army made its appearance soon after and camped two leagues from Ferdinand's headquarters. Nevertheless, they remained inactive for eight days, which allowed the populace of all the country, but specially of Brussels, where the news of the sack of Tienen had caused <b>great</b> <b>fear,</b> to escape to safer places.|$|E
25|$|After the {{convening}} of the Estates-General, agitation {{and anxiety}} grew until the storming of the Bastille, news of which reached the region around 20 July, causing hope but also increasing concerns of a reactionary plot of aristocrats. The <b>Great</b> <b>Fear</b> {{arose in the}} region of a rumor, and spread by degrees, at a blistering pace according to local networks, putting all the villages in motion for their defence. Once the peak of fear passed, a latent anxiety remained, the village communities realised that in an emergency, they were in fact isolated and practically reduced to their own devices. National guards were formed quickly, including in Valence, but communities found it insufficient, and they constituted local federations of mutual assistance, bypassing the old provincial divisions. In the region, it was Largentière which called for a Fête de la Fédération on 23 August, Romans-sur-Isère in September, La Voulte gathered 12,000 National Guardsmen to the Champs de l'Étoile on 29 November. Valence invited the surrounding communities on 31 January and brought together 16,000 guards of 293 communes. The region had other celebrations of federation in the winter and spring, culminating in the Fête de la Fédération of 14 July 1790, celebrated in Paris and simultaneously in 250 cities in France, including Valence.|$|E

Rowling imagined him as a [...] "scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard", and says she transferred part of her pain about losing her mother to him. During the book, Harry makes two close friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend, [...] "always there when you need him".

The stunt was dangerous, since the sudden rope jerk at the bottom could be fatal. Special effects supervisor Derek Meddings developed a system that would dampen the stop, but Sylvester recalled that his nerves nearly got the better of him: [...] "From where we were , you could see the local cemetery; and the box [...] looked like a casket. You didn't need to be an English major to connect the dots." [...] The stunt went off without a problem.|$|E

40|$|Experiences {{of obesity}} stigmatization {{and fear of}} fat, body image, and self-esteem, were {{examined}} in relation to weight loss and weight maintenance. Participants in obesity treatment (n= 185) with more stigmatizing experiences had poorer body image and <b>greater</b> <b>fear</b> of fat. Higher initial BMI, more stigmatizing experiences, lower body dissatisfaction, and <b>greater</b> <b>fear</b> of fat predicted greater weight loss. Higher initial BMI and more stigmatizing experiences predicted greater weight maintenance after 6 months in treatment. These findings suggest that despite the negative psychological correlates of stigmatization, experience and fear of obesity’s negative consequences may also be associated with improved treatment outcome...|$|R

Strachwitz then moved into a villa in Luzern where he was visited by his mother and sister. He had a <b>great</b> <b>fear</b> of being returned to France, and together {{they came up with}} a plan to avoid his extradition. He would [...] "sit out the war" [...] in a mental asylum in Switzerland. The plan worked, although Strachwitz's mental health genuinely deteriorated in the process. The war ended and Strachwitz was released to return to Germany. For his service during the war while imprisoned by the French he was awarded the Iron Cross (...) Second and First Class.|$|E
500|$|The Cimbrian War (113–101 BC) was a {{far more}} serious affair than the earlier clashes of 121 BC. [...] The Germanic tribes of the Cimbri and the Teutons or Teutones {{migrated}} from northern Europe into Rome's northern territories, where they clashed with Rome and her allies. The Cimbrian War {{was the first time}} since the Second Punic War that Italia and Rome itself had been seriously threatened, and caused <b>great</b> <b>fear</b> in Rome. The opening action of the Cimbrian War, the Battle of Noreia in 112 BC, ended in defeat and near disaster for the Romans. In 105 BC the Romans were defeated at the Battle of Arausio and was the costliest Rome had suffered since the Battle of Cannae. After the Cimbri inadvertently granted the Romans a reprieve by diverting to plunder Iberia, Rome was given the opportunity to carefully prepare for and successfully meet the Cimbri and Teutons in the Battle of Aquae Sextiae (102 BC) and the Battle of Vercellae (101 BC) where both tribes were virtually annihilated, ending the threat.|$|E
500|$|In 1955, von Neumann was {{diagnosed}} with what was either bone or pancreatic cancer. He {{was not able to}} well accept the proximity of his own demise, and the shadow of impending death instilled <b>great</b> <b>fear</b> in him. He invited a Roman Catholic priest, Father Anselm Strittmatter, O.S.B., to visit him for consultation. Von Neumann reportedly said, [...] "So long as there is the possibility of eternal damnation for nonbelievers it is more logical to be a believer at the end," [...] essentially saying that Pascal had a point, referring to Pascal's Wager. He had earlier confided to his mother, [...] "There probably has to be a God. Many things are easier to explain if there is than if there isn't." [...] Father Strittmatter administered the last rites to him. Some of von Neumann's friends (such as Abraham Pais and Oskar Morgenstern) said they had always believed him to be [...] "completely agnostic." [...] Of this deathbed conversion, Morgenstern told Heims, [...] "He was of course completely agnostic all his life, and then he suddenly turned Catholic—it doesn't agree with anything whatsoever in his attitude, outlook and thinking when he was healthy." [...] Father Strittmatter recalled that even after his conversion, von Neumann did not receive much peace or comfort from it, as he still remained terrified of death.|$|E
