40|$|Folic {{acid and}} <b>folates</b> have an {{important}} role in prevention of neural tube defect that appears in the first weeks of pregnancy, when women are still not aware of their pregnancy, especially when pregnancy is not planned. Since ensuring sufficient quantities of <b>folates</b> and folic acid in this period is essential, dietary habits of childbearing age women are very important. In line with that the intake of <b>folates</b> and folic acid in nutrition of women age group 20 – 30 years is examined, as well as the frequency of consumption of foodstuffs rich in vitamins and folic acid supplements. Values of <b>folates</b> in serum are presented, dependent on their nutritional habits. Obtained results indicate that in spite of inadequate intake of <b>folates</b> and folic acid from foodstuffs, clinical deficit is not recorded, which is the result of frequent consumption of dietary supplements. In accordance with these dietary habits, differences in the <b>folates</b> status of examinees were observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{structures of the}} two modified <b>folates</b> present in Thermococcus litoralis were established. These compounds, each containing a core structure of 1 -[4 -[[1 -(2 -amino- 7 -methyl- 4 -oxo- 6 -pteridinyl) -ethyllami-nolphenyl]- 1 -deoxy-[1 -c-D-ribofuranosylJ-ribitol, were characterized. The five position of the ribose in this core structure was, 8 -linked to the C- 1 of a poly- 13 (1 [...] . 4) N-acetylglucosamine having a chain length {{of four or five}} N-acetylglucosamine residues. Thus, these compounds are N-acetylglucosamine homologs of the modified <b>folates</b> found in Pyrococcusfuriosus. Recent work on the analysis of the modified <b>folates</b> present in thermophilic archaea has shown that species from both genera of the order Thermococcales (i. e., Pyrococcus and Thermococcus) contain different modified <b>folates</b> (5). Structural characterization of the modified <b>folates</b> in Pyro-coccus furosus show them to consist of the three similar structures shown in Fig. 1 (6).

40|$|Context <b>Folates</b> are B-vitamins that {{cannot be}} {{generated}} de novo {{and are therefore}} obtained from the diet. In the brain, these vitamins are involved in nucleotide synthesis, DNA repair, lipid metabolism, methylation and neurotransmitter synthesis. It is well established that adequate levels of maternal <b>folates</b> are required for closure of the neural tube within {{the first month of}} pregnancy, however, {{it is not clear whether}} maternal <b>folates</b> are needed throughout pregnancy for brain development and whether they influence offspring neurological function after birth. The aim of this review is to outline current literature from epidemiological and animal model studies that shows maternal supplementation of <b>folates</b> throughout pregnancy does indeed affect offspring neurological function after birth. Evidence Acquisition A Medline search was performed using the following mesh terms, maternal-fetal exchange, folic acid, offspring neurologic manifestations, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), embryology, and behavior. Results The studies described in the present review have reported that maternal deficiencies in <b>folates</b> during pregnancy result in changes in behavior as well as in blood and brain tissue in offspring, including altered methylation, including reduced levels of the global methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and increased levels of oxidative stress. Conclusions The data summarized here outlines the importance of adequate levels of <b>folates</b> throughout pregnancy to facilitate appropriate neurological development of offspring after birth...|$|R

5|$|Special {{investigations}} may be {{indicated to}} rule out other causes of oral ulceration. These include blood tests to exclude anemia, deficiencies of iron, <b>folate</b> or vitamin B12 or celiac disease. However, the nutritional deficiencies may be latent and the peripheral blood picture may appear relatively normal. Some suggest that screening for celiac disease should form part of the routine work up for individuals complaining of recurrent oral ulceration. Many of the systemic diseases cause other symptoms apart from oral ulceration, which {{is in contrast to}} aphthous stomatitis where there is isolated oral ulceration. Patch testing may be indicated if allergies are suspected (e.g. a strong relationship between certain foods and episodes of ulceration). Several drugs can cause oral ulceration (e.g. nicorandil), and a trial substitution to an alternative drug may highlight a causal relationship.|$|E
5|$|Water {{and carbon}} dioxide from the {{interstitial}} fluid diffuse into the epithelial cells. Within these cells, carbonic anhydrase converts the substances into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the interstitium. Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen. This creates osmotic pressure and draws water into the CSF, facilitated by aquaporins. Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium, to maintain electroneutrality. Potassium and bicarbonate are also transported out of the CSF. As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein. Choroid plexuses also secrete growth factors, vitamins B1, 12 C, <b>folate,</b> beta-2 microglobulin, arginine vasopressin and nitrous oxide into the CSF. A Na-K-Cl cotransporter and Na/K ATPase found {{on the surface of}} the choroid endothelium, appears to play a role in regulating CSF secretion and composition.|$|E

40|$|Elevation of {{homocysteine}} {{is associated}} with an increased risk for bone fractures. Whether the risk is due to homocysteine or to the reduced levels of cofactors necessary for its metabolisation, such as <b>folates</b> or vitamin B 12, is not completely clear. In this study we wanted to determine whether in postmenopausal women, levels of <b>folates,</b> homocysteine or vitamin B 12 are predictive of the rate of vertebral bone mineral density (BMD) change. The study was conducted at the centre for the menopause of our university hospital. Between September 2001 and March 2002, 161 healthy postmenopausal women volunteered for a cross-sectional evaluation of BMD and levels of serum <b>folates,</b> homocysteine and vitamin B 12. Women were recalled for a second evaluation of vertebral BMD after about 5 years. Women having used anti-resorptive therapies for more than 1 year were excluded. The analysis was possible in 117 postmenopausal women. The annual rate of vertebral BMD change was independently related to levels of <b>folates</b> (coefficient of regression (CR) : 2. 040; 95 %CI: 0. 483, 3. 596; p= 0. 011), and initial BMD values (CR: - 0. 060; 95 %CI: - 0. 117, - 0. 003; p= 0. 040). No significant relation was found between the change of vertebral BMD and homocysteine or vitamin B 12. BMD values at the first (r= 0. 225; p= 0. 016) and the second (r= 0. 206; p= 0. 027) evaluation were related to levels of <b>folates,</b> but not of homocysteine or of vitamin B 12. These data suggest an important role for <b>folates</b> deficiency in the vertebral BMD decline of postmenopausal women...|$|R
25|$|Concentrations {{of blood}} plasma <b>folate</b> and {{homocysteine}} concentrations are inversely related, such that {{an increase in}} dietary <b>folate</b> decreases homocysteine concentration.

25|$|The {{link between}} levels of <b>folate</b> and altered mental {{function}} is not large, but is sufficient enough {{to suggest a}} causal association.

Methods The stability {{of vitamins}} was studied in whole blood at room temperature after light exposure up to 24 h (vitamin C), 48 h (vitamins A, E, B 1, B 2, B 6 and carotenoids) and 72 h (vitamins K, B 12, red blood cell (RBC) and serum <b>folates).</b> Vitamin C stability after baseline acidification was analysed up to 48 h. Changes observed were compared to a clinical cut-off defined as total change limit based {{on a combination of}} analytical performance and within-subject variation. Results Clinically and statistically significant changes occurred only in vitamins C (- 22. 5 %), B 6 (+ 9. 9 %) and serum <b>folates</b> (- 16. 8 %) concentrations after 6, 24 and 48 h, respectively. Vitamins A, E, K, B 1, B 2, B 12, RBC <b>folates</b> and carotenoids showed good stability up to 48 or 72 h. Vitamin C in acidified serum conserved at room temperature appeared unstable. The optimal condition for acidified vitamin C conservation was at less than - 20 ?. Conclusion The majority of vitamins remain stable for up to 48 h.

Accurate determination of <b>folates</b> in rice seeds required the optimisation of an extraction procedure encompassing homogenisation, heat treatment, tri-enzyme treatment (alpha-amylase, protease and deconjugase), centrifugation and Ultrafiltration. The resulting extract was loaded onto a Polaris C 18 -A column, followed by gradient elution and detection by tandem mass spectrometry. The validated method is sensitive, reproducible, accurate, and linear between 1 and 400 mu g/ 100 g rice (dry weight). The limit of detection and limit Of quantification in diluted rice matrix ranged between 0. 2 and 1. 2 mu g/ 100 g and between 0. 6 and 4 mu g/ 100 g, respectively, depending on the Compound. Intra- and inter-day precision varied, respectively, from 1. 0 to 9. 1 % RSD, and from 3. 4 to 13. 5 % RSD, except for one Compound (19. 1 % at low concern rations).

Quantitation of <b>folates</b> after separation from the milk matrix was accomplished by post-column pH adjustment to pH 2. 5, and fluorescence detection. Milk was found to contain significant levels of 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate. Both thermal processing and fermentation reduced the level of 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate in milk.
