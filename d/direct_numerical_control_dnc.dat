However, the recent demand for more precision, faster feeds, exotic sensors, and branching execution have existing computer <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> (CNC) and distributed <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> (<b>DNC)</b> systems running at maximum controller capacity.

50|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> (<b>DNC),</b> {{also known}} as {{distributed}} numerical control (also DNC), is a common manufacturing term for networking CNC machine tools. On some CNC machine controllers, the available memory {{is too small to}} contain the machining program (for example machining complex surfaces), so in this case the program is stored in a separate computer and sent directly to the machine, one block at a time. If the computer is connected to a number of machines it can distribute programs to different machines as required. Usually, the manufacturer of the control provides suitable DNC software. However, if this provision is not possible, some software companies provide DNC applications that fulfill the purpose. DNC networking or DNC communication is always required when CAM programs are to run on some CNC machine control.|$|E

Lately, it has been adopted as a multi-platform 3 -D product life cycle management solution and is used widely as a design platform in several industries, including the automobile, aerospace, ship-building, and consumer electronics industries. It supports multiple phases of product development, including design (i. e., computer-aided design—CAD), analysis (computer-aided engineering —CAE), and manufacturing (computer-aided manufacturing—CAM). It includes, among others, the following capabilities. 3 -D Modeling CATIA uses three methods to create 3 -D objects: (1) Wireframe modeling uses parametric/mathematical data to produce visual presentations of physical objects. For instance, CATIA can draw a circle by specifying {{the location of the}} center in space and the length of its diameter, or specify the edge of an object by connecting its constituent vertices using straight lines or curves. As shown in Figure A 1, wireframe modeling allows visualization of the underlying design “structure ” of a 3 -D model. The wireframe format is widely used in programming tool paths for <b>direct</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> (<b>DNC)</b> machine tools. (2) Surface modeling describes freeform surfaces of a 3 -D object. Since freeform surfaces do not have rigid radial dimensions, CATIA describes the shape using non-uniform rational basis splines (NURBS) and Bézier splines. As shown in Figure A 2, the freeform surfaces are defined by manipulating the surface control points, degree, and number of segments of curves. As a result, free forms, such as buildin...|$|E

The spanwise wall velocity variations introduce streamwise vortex braids in the wake that are responsible for reducing the drag induced by the primary spanwise vortices shed by the cylinder.

40|$|Magnetic {{fields of}} low-mass {{stars and planets}} are thought to {{originate}} from self-excited dynamo action in their convective interiors. Observations reveal a variety of field topologies ranging from large-scale, axial dipole to more structured magnetic fields. In this article, we investigate more than 70 three-dimensional, self-consistent dynamo models obtained by <b>direct</b> <b>numerical</b> simulations. The <b>control</b> parameters, the aspect ratio and the mechanical boundary conditions have been varied to build up this sample of models. Both, strongly dipolar and multipolar models have been obtained. We show that these dynamo regimes can in general be distinguished by the ratio of a typical convective length scale to the Rossby radius. Models with a predominantly dipolar magnetic field were obtained, if the convective length scale is at least {{an order of magnitude}} larger than the Rossby radius. Moreover, we highlight the role of the strong shear associated with the geostrophic zonal flow for models with stress-free boundary conditions. In this case, the above transition disappears and is replaced by a region of bistability for which dipolar and multipolar dynamos co-exist. We interpret our results in terms of dynamo eigenmodes using the so-called test-field method. We can thus show that models in the dipolar regime are characterized by an isolated 'single mode'. Competing overtones become significant as the boundary to multipolar dynamos is approached. We discuss how these findings relate to previous models and to observations.
