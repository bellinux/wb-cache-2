Several apects are necessary to consider for proper <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> utilization by the cattle, as follows: climatic conditions, proper field operations for each crop, optimal harvest date, and farm technical and economical resources. With a high degree of succulence, <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> and derived products (silage, haylage), present addvantages as compared to hay, having superior indices of nutritive value and palatability. A <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> supply scheme was applied on an area of 188 ha taking into account dairy cattle biological traits. Crop structure was as follows: forage maize, Sudan grass, Italian ryegrass, new lucern and old lucerne, and orchardgrass. Insuring the required superior <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> for the dairy cattle according to forage rations, represents one of the main techniques to maximize milk production and to minimize milk production cost...|$|R

40|$|Ten alfalfa {{varieties}} {{were tested}} at the Rimski Sancevi Experiment Field {{in the period}} 1991 - 1994. The following characteristics were analyzed: yield of dry matter, yield of <b>green</b> <b>forage,</b> stem length and diameter, lamina length and width, regeneration rate, number of intemodes, proportion of leaves {{and the content of}} crude proteins. Stem length, yield of <b>green</b> <b>forage,</b> regeneration rate and the proportion of leaves exhibited direct positive effects on dry matter yield. Number of internodes, lamina length and the content of crude proteins exhibited negative direct effects. Yield of <b>green</b> <b>forage,</b> stein length and regeneration rate exhibited also indirect positive effects, via other characteristics. They may be used as selection criteria in alfalfa breeding for increased yield of dry matter. In addition to the significant positive direct effect, the portion of leaves had negative indirect effects, via <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> yield, stem length, growth rate and the content of crude proteins.

Application of Chromolaena odorata on latosol as mulch material is expected to improve corn production by contributing organic nutrition. The objectives of this research were to recognize the effect of Chromolaena odorata on production and quality of <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> of high density corn, and to observe the contribution of phosphorous mineral from decomposition of Chromolaena odorata in the ground. This research was divided into two steps of experiment. The first experiment, consisted of two levels of treatments, i. e. : with and without Chromolaena odorata (12 ton/ha). The plants were fertilized with 60 kg K/ha and 225 kg N/ha. Plant was harvested at 40 days after planting. In the second experiment, corns were cultivated {{in the same area}} and the application of mulch (12 ton/ha) and P (60 kg/ha). Mulch increased significantly vertical height but there was no effect on production of <b>green</b> <b>forage,</b> mineral content in crop and uptake of P and N.

40|$|Forage sorghum {{is one of}} {{the most}} heat and drought {{resistant}} cereal forage having the potential to yield nutritious forage even during the months of extreme heat for dairy animals. It yields considerably higher biomass production with less use of fertilizers and irrigations. It can be grown in almost all types of soils and has the potential to tolerate soil toxicities without considerable reduction in <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> yield. But in Pakistan, per hectare <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> yield of sorghum is much less (about 13 tons per hectare in irrigated tracts) than the potential. Rainfed areas are producing even less <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> yield than irrigated tracts. A variety of factors reduce forage sorghum yield including selection of unsuitable forage sorghum cultivars, poor seed bed preparation, weeds and fewer use of fertilizers. Appropriate agronomic management strategies hold the key in bridging the gap between forage sorghum yield and potential. Appropriate variety selection, pre-sowing seed priming and seed treatment with fungicide, fine seed bed preparation, line sowing, balanced use of fertilizers at optimum time, irrigation management, insect-pest management and harvesting at 50 % flowering stage are few of the strategies which can increase the forage sorghum yield to a great extent. Appropriate agronomic management strategies are bound to increase the forage sorghum yield as well as its quality attributes particularly protein contents. In this way, sustainable supply of <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> during summer reduces the drastic effects of forage shortage and ultimately milk production on sustainable basis can be ensured to cater the needs of rising population...|$|R
