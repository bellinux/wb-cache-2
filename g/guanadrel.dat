50|$|<b>Guanadrel</b> is a postganglionic {{adrenergic}} blocking agent. Uptake of <b>guanadrel</b> {{and storage}} in sympathetic neurons occurs via the norepinephrine pump; <b>guanadrel</b> slowly displaces norepinephrine from its storage in nerve endings and thereby blocks {{the release of}} norepinephrine normally produced by nerve stimulation. The reduction in neurotransmitter release in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation, {{as a result of}} catecholamine depletion, leads to reduced arteriolar vasoconstriction, especially the reflex increase in sympathetic tone that occurs with a change in position. <b>Guanadrel</b> is rapidly and well absorbed from gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
50|$|<b>Guanadrel</b> can be {{synthesized}} when cyclohexanone undergoes ketalization by 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol, forming 2-chloromethyl-1,4-dioxyspiro4,5decane, {{which is}} further reacted with sodium phthalimide. After alkaline hydrazinolysis, the resulting phthalimide derivative {{is transformed into}} 2-aminomethyl-1,4-dioxyspiro4,5decane, which is reacted with S-methylthiourea, giving the desired <b>guanadrel.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{guanidine}} part of {{the molecule}} also appears in guanoxan and <b>guanadrel.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Guanadrel</b> is an {{antihypertensive}} agent. It {{is used in}} {{the form}} of its sulfate.|$|E
50|$|In 1981 the JAMA {{reported}} <b>guanadrel</b> as {{an effective}} step II or step III treatment of hypertension.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that there is homologous upregulation of arterial alpha-adrenergic responsiveness during suppression of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity in humans. 10 subjects (19 - 28 yr) were studied during placebo and when SNS activity was suppressed by <b>guanadrel.</b> Changes in forearm blood flow (FABF) mediated by the intraarterial infusion of norepinephrine (NE), angiotensin II (AII), and phentolamine were measured by plethysmography. During <b>guanadrel</b> compared with placebo, plasma NE levels (1. 28 +/- 0. 09 - 0. 85 +/- 0. 06 nM; P = 0. 0001) and the extra vascular NE release rate derived from [3 H]NE kinetics were lower (7. 1 +/- 0. 7 - 4. 0 +/- 0. 2 nmol/min per m 2; P = 0. 0004), suggesting suppression of SNS activity. During <b>guanadrel,</b> there was increased sensitivity in the FABF response to NE (analysis of variance P = 0. 03). In contrast, there was no difference in the FABF response to AII (analysis of variance P = 0. 81), suggesting that the upregulation observed to NE was homologous. The increase in FABF during phentolamine was similar during <b>guanadrel</b> compared with placebo (guanadrel: 141 +/- 37 vs. placebo; 187 +/- 27 % increase; P = 0. 33), suggesting that there was at least partial compensation to maintain constant endogenous arterial alpha-adrenergic tone. We conclude that there is homologous upregulation of arterial alpha-adrenergic responsiveness in humans when SNS activity is suppressed by <b>guanadrel...</b>|$|E
