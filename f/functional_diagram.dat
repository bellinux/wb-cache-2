40|$|Purpose {{and method}} : The {{purpose of this}} paper is to clarify the {{validity}} of the analytical method using a <b>functional</b> <b>diagram</b> in broad sense which was elaborated and clarified in the last paper, through an analysis of 11 examples of housing plans collected from the viewpoint of two pairs of coordinate axis, namely : 1. East and West, and 2. modernity and tradition. A <b>functional</b> <b>diagram</b> in broad sense, in this case, means one which express a combination-unit-space of parts-unit-space which is the minimum-unit-space for living activities and whole-unit-space which is an abstract and formless space. Whole-unit-space is also used to recognize and understand a plan of a house itself as a single-unit-space. Conclusion : In the case of space analysis of housing space, particularly for a housing space in Japan, analysis from the standpoint of <b>functional</b> <b>diagram</b> on broad sense is considered to be valid. Furthermore an entity of the combination-unit-space is characteristic of a spatial structure of Japanese housing...|$|E
