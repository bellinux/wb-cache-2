5|$|At {{a remote}} {{industrial}} site, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), and Jeremiah Smith (Roy Thinnes) are approached by the Alien Bounty <b>Hunter</b> (Brian Thompson). Mulder and Smith flee with both Scully and the Bounty <b>Hunter</b> in pursuit, eventually reaching a waterfront. Mulder sneaks {{up on the}} Bounty <b>Hunter</b> and stabs him in the neck with the alien stiletto. Both he and Jeremiah escape on a boat, leaving Scully alone with the seemingly dead Bounty <b>Hunter.</b> When she approaches the body, the Bounty <b>Hunter</b> wakes up and chokes her, demanding to know where Mulder and Smith are heading. He releases her after realizing she has no such knowledge.|$|E

50|$|Market <b>hunters,</b> or {{commercial}} <b>hunters,</b> hunt wild land animals. (Their counterparts at sea are called commercial fishermen and whalers.) They are distinguished from subsistence <b>hunters</b> and recreational <b>hunters</b> by {{their use of}} the animals they kill: Market <b>hunters</b> sell or trade the flesh, bones, and/or skins and feathers of slain animals as a source of income; subsistence <b>hunters</b> and their families and local tribes use these materials directly as food, clothing, tools, and/or shelter; recreational <b>hunters</b> often consume the flesh of their kills and/or use the skins for decoration or clothing.|$|R
5|$|A {{traditional}} {{game called}} kitsune-ken (fox-fist) references the kitsune's powers over human beings. The game {{is similar to}} rock, paper, scissors, but the three hand positions signify a fox, a <b>hunter,</b> and a village headman. The headman beats the <b>hunter,</b> whom he outranks; the <b>hunter</b> beats the fox, whom he shoots; the fox beats the headman, whom he bewitches.|$|E
5|$|By 1975, {{plans were}} laid {{to replace the}} <b>Hunter</b> in the air-to-air role with a more modern fighter aircraft, the Northrop F-5E Tiger II. The <b>Hunter</b> {{remained}} in a key role within the Swiss Air Force; like the RAF's <b>Hunter</b> fleet, the type transitioned to become the country's primary ground attack platform, replacing the Venom. While the Swiss Hunters already had more armament options than the RAF aircraft, being cleared to carry Oerlikon 80mm rockets instead of the elderly 3-inch rockets used by the RAF, to carry bombs from both inner and outer pylons and to launch AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, the change to a primary air-to-ground role resulted in the <b>Hunter</b> 80 upgrade, adding chaff/flare dispensers, BL755 cluster bombs {{and the ability to}} carry AGM-65 Maverick missiles.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hunters</b> {{position}} themselves in blinds near rivers, lakes, ponds or in agriculture fields planted with corn, barley, wheat or millet. <b>Hunters</b> build blinds to conceal themselves from waterfowl, as waterfowl have sharp eyes and can see colors. That is why <b>hunters</b> use camouflage. Waterfowl <b>hunters</b> also often use dogs to retrieve dead or injured {{birds in the}} water. There are many retriever breeds, such as Labrador Retrievers and Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, specifically bred for the task. <b>Hunters</b> also may use a boat to get downed birds.Some <b>hunters</b> use boats as blinds or float rivers in search of waterfowl. When the ducks see the <b>hunters</b> in the boat, ducks flush off the water and <b>hunters</b> shoot. Then birds are collected {{and placed in the}} boat.|$|R
50|$|On July 1, 1915, the US {{government}} hired {{its first}} government wolf <b>hunters.</b> Unlike the civilian bounty <b>hunters</b> of the prior century, the government <b>hunters</b> approached their work methodically and soberly.

5|$|Episode Two {{featured}} a new <b>Hunter</b> enemy, which {{had just been}} seen briefly in a recorded message in Episode One. The <b>Hunter</b> serves {{as one of the}} most dangerous enemies within the game and as means of emotional development for Alyx Vance. The <b>Hunter</b> is a powerful and resilient enemy which players must often run from while seeking a means to fight back; Episode Twos environments are designed with this in mind.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hunters</b> {{that have}} options to hunt in {{different}} areas should evaluate their previous hunting success when they decide where to hunt. Following optimal foraging theory for non-human predators we investigated if hunting success and density of other <b>hunters</b> on the hunting area will affect the probability of return to the same area, and if such behavioural changes {{will result in a}} higher hunting success compared to <b>hunters</b> that change to a new area. For this purpose we used detailed information about willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus) <b>hunters</b> on state owned land in Sweden. We found support for the optimal foraging theory application on grouse huntersâ€™ behavioural changes according to hunting success. The return rate increased with increasing hunting success and <b>hunters</b> that returned to the same area also increased their success compared to <b>hunters</b> that changed to a new area. Only one third of the <b>hunters</b> returned to the same area the subsequent year. We also found a negative effect of density of <b>hunters</b> in an area on <b>hunters</b> return rates and their hunting success, suggesting crowding among Swedish grouse <b>hunters...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{hypotheses}} that marginal utility from killing game animals in New Zealand big game hunts diminishes with number of kills, and that hunt motivations affect marginal satisfaction. In addition to comparison of mean satisfaction scores for <b>hunters</b> experiencing different measures of success, {{and measures of}} association based on correlations and analysis of variance, a random parameters ordered-logit model utilises panel data from {{a large number of}} <b>hunters</b> to model effects of success on satisfaction. Motivations are important determinants of satisfaction, with harvest-oriented <b>hunters</b> generally less satisfied than were other <b>hunters,</b> unless the harvest-oriented <b>hunters</b> made a kill. Sighting game significantly enhanced satisfaction, which increased more if the <b>hunters</b> killed a game animal. Making a kill had a smaller effect on satisfaction for high-avidity <b>hunters.</b> Results confirm diminishing marginal utility of kills, suggesting potential gains from management responses that spread the game harvest over a larger number of <b>hunters...</b>|$|R
