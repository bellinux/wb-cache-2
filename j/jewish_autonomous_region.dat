500|$|Koval {{was born}} to Russian Jewish {{immigrants}} in Sioux City, Iowa, US. Shortly after reaching adulthood he traveled with his parents to the Soviet Union to settle in the <b>Jewish</b> <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Region</b> near the Chinese border. Koval was recruited by the Soviet Main Intelligence Directorate, trained, and assigned the code name DELMAR. [...] He returned to the United States in 1940 and was drafted into the US Army in early 1943. [...] Koval worked at atomic research laboratories and, according to the Russian government, relayed back to the Soviet Union information about the production processes and volumes of the polonium, plutonium, and uranium used in American atomic weaponry, and descriptions of the weapon production sites. [...] In 1948, Koval left on a European vacation but never returned to the United States. [...] In 2007 Russian President Vladimir Putin posthumously awarded Koval the Hero of the Russian Federation decoration for [...] "his courage and heroism while carrying out special missions".|$|E

2500|$|Stalin's {{increasing}} {{tolerance of}} anti-Semitism may have stemmed from his increasing Russian nationalism {{or from the}} recognition that anti-Semitism had proved a useful mobilising tool for Hitler {{and that he could}} do the same; he may have increasingly viewed the Jewish people as a [...] "counter-revolutionary" [...] nation whose members were loyal to the U.S. There were rumours, although they have never been substantiated, that Stalin was planning on deporting all Soviet Jews to the <b>Jewish</b> <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Region</b> in Birobidzhan, eastern Siberia.|$|E

50|$|In 1939, Inuzuka, {{along with}} Colonel Yasue and Ishiguro Shiro of the Foreign Ministry, {{recommended}} that Japan {{set up an}} <b>autonomous</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>region</b> near Shanghai; by providing {{a safe place for}} Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany to settle, and granting them the political and economic autonomy to live as they desired.

50|$|There was {{a slight}} revival in the Birobidzhan idea after the war as a {{potential}} home for Jewish refugees. During that time, the Jewish population of the region peaked at almost one-third of the total. But efforts in this direction ended, with the Doctors' plot, the establishment of Israel as a Jewish state, and Stalin's second wave of purges shortly before his death. Again the Jewish leadership was arrested and {{efforts were made to}} stamp out Yiddish culture—even the Judaica collection in the local library was burned. In the ensuing years, the idea of an <b>autonomous</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>region</b> in the Soviet Union was all but forgotten.|$|R
5000|$|The Russian Federation {{has made}} few {{changes in the}} Soviet pattern of {{regional}} jurisdictions. The 1993 constitution establishes a federal government and enumerates eighty-nine subnational jurisdictions, including twenty-one ethnic enclaves with the status of republics. There are ten <b>autonomous</b> <b>regions,</b> or okruga (sing., okrug [...] ), and the <b>Jewish</b> <b>Autonomous</b> Oblast (Yevreyskaya avtonomnaya oblast', also known as Birobidzhan). Besides the ethnically identified jurisdictions, there are six territories (kraya sing., kray [...] ) and forty-nine oblasts (provinces). The cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg are independent of surrounding jurisdictions; termed [...] "cities of federal significance," [...] {{they have the same}} status as the oblasts. The ten <b>autonomous</b> <b>regions</b> and Birobidzhan are part of larger jurisdictions, either an oblast or a territory. As the power and influence of the central government have become diluted, governors and mayors have become the only relevant government authorities in many jurisdictions.|$|R
