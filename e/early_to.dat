5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Bermuda on August 25, and ultimately discontinued {{about three days}} later. Two cruise ships left Bermuda <b>early</b> <b>to</b> avoid the storm, and another two postponed their scheduled stops there.

Cristobal ultimately passed well to the northwest of the island, producing breezy conditions and heightened surf.|$|E

Kemp announced his intention to steal 40 bases this season and Lopes hoped they would be high percentage steals. At {{the end of the}} season, Kemp had the 40 steals and was only caught 11 times, a significant improvement in percentage from the previous year, and his work with Lopes was credited for much of the improvement.|$|E

In 1746, the position of Master Carpenter to the Board of Ordnance became vacant, and Adam was quick to put forward his son John's name for consideration, although he was unsuccessful in securing him the post. His three eldest sons were all involved in the family business by 1746, James and John both leaving Edinburgh University <b>early</b> <b>to</b> join their father.|$|E

5|$|Among other factors, {{the growth}} of {{low-cost}} airline flights to Bratislava, led by Ryanair, has led to conspicuous stag parties, primarily from the UK. While these are a boom to the city's tourism industry, cultural differences and vandalism have led to concern by local officials. Reflecting the popularity of rowdy parties in Bratislava in the <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid-2000s, the city was a setting in the 2004 comedy film Eurotrip, which was actually filmed {{in the city and}} suburbs of Prague, the Czech Republic.|$|E
5|$|Ann Arbor {{was founded}} in 1824, named for wives of the village's founders and the stands of Bur Oak trees. The University of Michigan moved from Detroit to Ann Arbor in 1837, and the city grew at a rapid rate in the <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid-20th century. During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a {{reputation}} as a center for left-wing politics. Ann Arbor became a focal point for political activism and anti-Vietnam War movement, as well as various student movements.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{relatively}} mild temperate climate with ample precipitation, the areas around Image Lake boast rich natural habitats with many species of plants, insects, rodents, and large mammals. Native Americans took advantage of these resources, and may have inhabited the area seasonally. However, human activity such as hunting, fishing, and mining, and recreational overuse increased after the arrival of Europeans. As a result, some areas experienced significant environmental degradation {{near the end of the}} nineteenth century and the early twentieth century, including the eradication of large predatory animals. Recreational overuse and the presence of livestock were especially problematic in the <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid-twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|Beauregard {{continued}} {{commanding the}} defenses of Petersburg {{in the early}} days of the siege, but with the loss of the Weldon Railroad in the Battle of Globe Tavern (August 18–21), he was criticized for not attacking more forcefully and he became dissatisfied with the command arrangements under Lee. He hoped for an independent command, but his desires were thwarted in two instances: Lee chose Lt. Gen. Jubal <b>Early</b> <b>to</b> lead an expedition north through the Shenandoah Valley and threaten Washington, and Davis chose Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood to replace the faltering Joseph E. Johnston in the Atlanta Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1877, {{residents}} of Ridgefield have remembered {{the battle with}} some form of anniversary ceremony every twenty-five years. A full day tribute was hosted at former Connecticut Governor Phineas C. Lounsbury's Town Street mansion {{in conjunction with the}} town's bicentennial celebration in 1908. The 150th anniversary affair in 1927 featured the publication of George Lounsbury Rockwell's History of Ridgefield, and the 200th anniversary was held a year <b>early</b> <b>to</b> tie in with America's bicentennial celebration in 1976. The bicentennial and 225th anniversary celebrations included re-enactments of the battle, for which portions of Town Street (now Main Street) were covered with dirt for sake of authenticity.|$|E

5|$|By the 15th {{century the}} reach and {{influence}} of the Burgundian princes meant that the Low Countries' merchant and banker classes were in the ascendancy. The <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid-century saw great rises in international trade and domestic wealth, leading to an enormous increase in the demand for art. Artists from the area attracted patronage from the Baltic coast, the north German and Polish regions, the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and the powerful families of England and Scotland. At first, masters had acted as their own dealers, attending fairs where they could also buy frames, panels and pigments. The mid-century saw the development of art dealership as a profession; the activity became purely commercially driven, dominated by the mercantile class.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{arose in}} Cappadocia {{relatively}} late with {{no evidence of}} a Christian community before the late second century AD. Alexander of Jerusalem was the first bishop of the province in the <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid third century, a period in which Christians suffered persecution from the local Roman authorities. The community remained very small throughout the third century: when Gregory Thaumaturgus acceded to the bishopric in c. 250, according to his namesake, the Nyssen, there were only seventeen members of the Church in Caesarea.|$|E
