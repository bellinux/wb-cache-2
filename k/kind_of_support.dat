25|$|Although Poets Follies earned Kees much notoriety, {{his other}} {{projects}} {{did not find}} the same <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> A film company ended in a lawsuit. His collaborations with Helm, Ketty Lester, and other musicians, although professionally satisfying, did not produce any hit records. A permanent home for the Poets Follies, the Showplace, a large building on Fulton Street in the Mission District, was closed in late May 1955, {{just days before the}} premiere of a serious one-act play, The Waiting Room, which Kees had written for three actress friends. During much of July, Kees spent time with a woman he had met while working at Langley Porter, a Jungian psychiatrist named Virginia Patterson. Like other relationships Kees had following his divorce, this ended abruptly. Kees, too, had been taking barbiturates for the past two years, which also had intensified his episodes of manic depression. After visiting his parents in Santa Barbara, California, one last time in early July, as well as his friend, the literary critic Hugh Kenner, Kees returned to San Francisco and had dinner with various friends, including Pauline Kael, who appeared as a guest on Kees’s film review program on KPFA-FM, Behind the Movie Camera. She noticed the disturbing changes in Kees’s demeanor. For several days in mid-July, Kees drank and commiserated with his friend and business partner, the San Francisco newspaperman and novelist Michael Grieg. He even confessed to have tried jumping over the rail of the Golden Gate Bridge, but he could not physically manage it. He talked of going to Mexico as an alternative, a country that fascinated him up until then in books such as Malcolm Lowry’s Under the Volcano. Then Kees returned to his home in the Marina District on the evening of July 17, 1955. What he did the following day is a mystery. He took a call from Michael Grieg, who told Kees of a possible job offer. Kees also telephoned a friend, the memoirist Janet Richards, seeking her company.|$|E

The group went further and claimed that the Venezuelan government was a [...] "protector and enforcer of the Yankee imperialist plans to expand their grip in the Caribbean and Central America" [...] and claimed that Venezuelan Army was receiving modern weapons in exchange.|$|E

Central Bank of Iceland governor Davíð Oddsson later clarified that the loan was still being negotiated.

What <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> are available for school librarians in Sweden? What are {{the similarities and differences}} between the support to school librarians in Japan and Sweden? The methodology used was semi-structured interviews. Three interviews with school librarians were conducted in each country. The theoretical framework used is David V. Loertscher’s Library media specialist taxonomy and Cristina Sacco Judge’s model for school libraries in Scotland. The results of the study are that the possibility to supplement the collection in the school library by extern loans is good in both countries. Regarding the school librarian’s need for professional information and support, conferences and courses seem to play a bigger role in Japan. Advice and help from experienced colleagues in the vicinity to the school seems to be important in Sweden but more or less non-existing in Japan...|$|R

It's not the weight loss per se—you know, Deborah Voigt has {{lost a lot of}} weight and still sounds glorious. But if one uses the weight for support, and then it's suddenly gone and one doesn't develop another musculature for support, it can be very hard on the voice.

[...] In discussing their report, Walter B. Slocombe said that while in the popular imagination, the U.S.-Israel relationship is only good for Israel, Israel provides enormous assistance to the United States, including military expertise which has saved American lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. [...] Robert D. Blackwill countered {{the claim that the}} U.S.-Israel relationship significantly damages the relationship between the United States and the Arab world. [...] He asked rhetorically: [...] "Would Saudi Arabia's policies toward the United States be markedly different in practice if Washington entered into a sustained crisis with Israel over the Palestine issue during which the bilateral relationship between the United States and Israel went into steep, systemic decline? In that instance, would Riyadh lower the price of oil? Would it stop hedging its regional bets concerning U.S. attempts to coerce Iran into freezing its nuclear weapons program? Would it regard U.S. policy toward Afghanistan any less critically? Would it view American democracy promotion in the Middle East more favorably? Would it be more inclined to reform its internal governmental processes to be more in line with U.S. preferences? Walt [...] and I judge the answer to all these questions [...] 'No.'" [...] When asked how this report could so flatly contradict the Walt and Mearsheimer thesis, Slocombe responded, [...] "There is so much error in the world," [...] and added, [...] "I think {{it would be interesting to}} ask them whether they make the same contrary argument about the other countries to whom we also provide something like this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> [...] There are obviously differences, but the principle is the same." ...|$|E

Apart from that common infirmity which leads people after they have discovered an analogy between two things, to argue from the properties of the one to those of the other, as if, instead of being analogous, they were identical, De Maistre was particularly fond of inferring moral truths from etymologies.

60|$|If {{anything}} were {{wanting to}} this necessary {{operation of the}} form of government, religion would have given it a complete effect. Religion, always a principle of energy, in this new people is no way worn out or impaired; and their mode of professing {{it is also one}} main cause of this free spirit. The people are Protestants; and of that kind which is the most adverse to all implicit submission of mind and opinion. This is a persuasion not only favourable to liberty, but built upon it. I do not think, Sir, that the reason of this averseness in the dissenting churches, from all that looks like absolute government, is so much to be sought in their religious tenets, as in their history. Every one knows that the Roman Catholic religion is at least coeval with most of the governments where it prevails; that it has generally gone hand in hand with them, and received great favour and every <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> from authority. The Church of England, too, was formed from her cradle, under the nursing care of regular government. But the dissenting interests have sprung up in direct opposition to all the ordinary powers of the world; and could justify that opposition only on a strong claim to natural liberty. Their very existence depended on the powerful and unremitted assertion of that claim. All Protestantism, even the most cold and passive, is a sort of dissent. But the religion most prevalent in our northern colonies is a refinement on the principle of resistance; it is the dissidence of dissent, and the Protestantism of the Protestant religion.|$|E
