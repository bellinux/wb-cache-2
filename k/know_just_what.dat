25|$|In 1974, author Stephen Cosgrove's children's book Wheedle on the Needle {{postulated}} a furry creature {{called a}} Wheedle {{who lived on}} top of the Space Needle and caused its light to flash. Its closing quatrain is: There's a Wheedle on the Needle/ I <b>know</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> you're thinking/ But if you look up late at night/ You'll see his red nose blinking. The Wheedle has since become a fixture of Seattle. It even became the mascot of the Seattle SuperSonics National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise, who played in nearby KeyArena (originally known as the Seattle Center Coliseum). The SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City on July 3, 2008.|$|E

2500|$|... ust {{as in the}} {{sciences}} {{we have learned that}} we are too ignorant to safely pronounce anything impossible, so for the individual, since we cannot <b>know</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> are his limitations, we can hardly say with certainty that anything is necessarily within or beyond his grasp. Each must remember that no one can predict to what heights of wealth, fame, or usefulness he may rise until he has honestly endeavored, and he should derive courage from the fact that all sciences have been, at some time, in the same condition as he, and that it has often proved true that the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow.|$|E
60|$|Peter {{looked a}} little shamefaced. He didn't <b>know</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> to say, so he said nothing and just nodded his head.|$|E

60|$|Neale did {{not want}} to show his reluctance, yet he did hot <b>know</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> to say. After all, he was drifting. So he went.|$|E

60|$|Larson {{stepped to}} the mark with the air of one who <b>knows</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> he is doing. Up went the hammer with a long swing--to land in the very spot where Tom had thrown it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid {{this storm}} will {{interfere}} with the art critics who were {{to look at those}} miniatures," [...] put in Ben. [...] "Oh, dear! I wish we <b>knew</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> those little paintings were worth." ...|$|R
