50|$|With {{the use of}} precast shapes, crew sizing can be minimized. Speed of {{installation}} {{is another}} obvious benefit to both the installer and the owner, resulting in reduced costs due to shorter job duration. Material usage is also reduced, {{when compared to other}} installation methods such as <b>guniting,</b> where as much as 45% of extra material is required to compensate for rebound and other job losses. Environmental hazards such as dusting and tripping hazards associated with equipment and hoses are also reduced substantially, if not eliminated. Future repairs also become much more economical and quicker to accomplish. Repair areas can be isolated to just the immediate wear area within the boundaries of a shape. Anchor attachment points can typically be reused. Replacement shapes, purchased early and kept as spare parts on site, can be easily installed in a fraction of the time required for conventional repair methods. The initial bake-out of a new refractory lining on site can be a very expensive and time-consuming component of a refractory repair project. The use of precast and prefired refractory shapes can sometimes reduce or even eliminate the need for an extensive initial bake-out. If an entire repair is made with a prefired system, then normal furnace start up schedules can be used, without the fear of steam spalls or other damage during the initial heating. Bake-out of multi-component linings, which may include a combination of precast shapes and other materials placed in the field, can often be reduced by the pre-firing of the castable shapes, particularly if that material would have been the critical item determining the bake out schedule. This can {{have a positive impact on}} not only job costs, but in reducing down time as well.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of field monitoring of repair patches in two reinforced concrete highway bridges, Lawns Lane Bridge on the M 1 and Gunthorpe Bridge across the River Trent. The repairs were applied by spraying (<b>guniting)</b> repair materials to compression members of the bridges. The structural members were unpropped during repair and throughout the 60 week monitoring period. The strains in the repair patches were monitored with vibrating-wire gauges. Four different repair materials were investigated whose elastic modulus was greater than that of the substrate concrete (E-rm > E-sub). The results show that efficient repairs are achieved with E-rm> E-sub, the optimum relationship being E-rm > 1. 3 E(sub). This enables the repair material to shed a significant proportion of its shrinkage strain to the substrate, thereby reducing restrained-shrinkage tension. It also enables the repair to attract externally applied load from the substrate in the long term. The effect of creep and shrinkage on the performance of the repair patch is also determined. Overall, the results show that current repair standards have limitations with respect to repair material specifications...|$|E

40|$|In {{this case}} study, {{a number of}} <b>gunite</b> {{swimming}} pools exhibited extensive map or alligator cracking that caused rough and uneven surfaces. The nature of the cracking pointed to alkali-silica reaction (ASR) {{as the cause of}} the cracking. Four test methods, the uranyl acetate method, petrographic examination, chemical analysis by electron microprobe, and X-ray diffraction, were used to investigate the presence of ASR within the <b>gunite.</b> Results showed (1) some evidence of ASR gel within the <b>gunite</b> using uranyl acetate; (2) the potential existence of alkali silica gel throughout the cement and within the fractures of the sand grains based on petrographic examination; (3) elevated levels of total alkali, indicating a potential for ASR to occur based on chemical analysis; and (4) tiny inclusions of thermonatrite (commonly found in ASR gel) based on X-ray diffraction. Results from each of the four test methods suggest, albeit inconclusively, the existence of ASR in the <b>gunite.</b> Additionally, the results of all of the four test methods did not contradict each other.

Between 1904-1909 this method was modified to spray sand and cement using a machine known as a Cement- Gun. <b>Gunite</b> was copyrighted in 1912 and continued as a proprietary trademark until 1967, when it became a generic term. The process involves a mixture of sand and cement which is loaded into one chamber, a stream of the dry mixture is forced along a delivery pipe to the gun, and on discharge is mixed with an annular jet of water. It was only in the 1920s that the process spread internationally, {{and it is difficult to}} ascertain whether other examples of bridges using the <b>Gunite</b> process, beside the St Paul Minnesota bridge, exist.

40|$|The Modified Light Duty Utility Arm (MLDUA) is a {{selectable}} {{seven or}} eight degree-of-freedom robot arm with a 16. 5 ft (5. 03 m) reach and a payload capacity of 200 lb. (90. 72 kg). The utility arm is controlled in either joystick-based telerobotic mode or auto sequence robotics mode. The MLDUA deployment system deploys the utility arm vertically into underground radioactive waste storage tanks located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. These tanks are constructed of <b>gunite</b> material and consist of two 25 ft (7. 62 m) diameter tanks in the North Tank Farm and six 50 ft (15. 24 m) diameter tanks in the South Tank Farm. After deployment inside a tank, the utility arm reaches and grasps the confined sluicing end effecter (CSEE) which {{is attached to the}} hose management arm (HMA). The utility arm positions the CSEE within the tank to allow the HMA to sluice the tank's liquid and solid waste from the tank. The MLDUA is used to deploy the characterization end effecter (CEE) and <b>gunite</b> scarifying end effecter (GSEE) into the tank. The CEE is used to survey the tank wall's radiation levels and the physical condition of the walls. The GSEE is used to scarify the tank walls with high-pressure water to remove the wall scale buildup and a thin layer of <b>gunite</b> which reduces the radioactive contamination that is embedded into the <b>gunite</b> walls. The MLDUA is also used to support waste sampling and wall core-sampling operations. Other tools that have been developed for use by the MLDUA include a pipe-plugging end effecter, pipe-cutting end effecter, and pipe-cleaning end effecter.

The thickness of both the sidewall and the domed roof increases to 30 in. near their juncture. The tank floor is nominally 3 -in. thick, except at the juncture with the wall where the thickness increases to 9 in. The tanks are constructed of <b>gunite</b> (a mixture of Portland cement, sand, and water in the form of a mortar) sprayed from the nozzle of a cement gun against a form or a solid surface.

In FY 1998 pulsating mixer pump technology, a jet mixer powered by a reciprocating air supply, was selected for FY 1999 deployment {{in one of the}} GAAT tanks to mobilize settled solids. Pulsating mixer pump technology was identified in FY 1996 during technical exchanges between the US Department of Energy (DOE) Tanks Focus Area Retrieval and Closure program, the DOE Environmental Management International Programs, and delegates from Russia as a promising technology that could be implemented in the US. The pulsating mixer pump technology, provided by the Russian Integrated Mining Chemical Company, was tested at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to observe its ability to mobilize settled solids.

The deployment of this device is expected to significantly reduce the costs of operation and maintenance of more expensive retrieval systems.
