50|$|Increases in the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> labour {{will move}} the economy along the demand curve, {{increasing}} wages and employment. The <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> labour {{in an economy}} {{is derived from the}} <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> goods and services.

50|$|In {{economics}} derived <b>demand</b> is <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> {{a factor}} of production or intermediate good that {{occurs as a result}} of the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> another intermediate or Economics help - Derived In essence, the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> one is dependent on that whose demand its demand is derived from. For example, if the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> a good such as wheat increases, then this leads to an increase in the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> labour. <b>For</b> another example, <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> steel leads to derived <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> steel workers, as steel workers are necessary for the production of steel. As the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> steel increases, so does its price. The increase in price means manufacturers of steel can gain more in revenue if they produce more steel, thus leading to a higher <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> the resources involved in producing steel.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contains}} a micro econometric analysis of household electricity {{and natural gas}} <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> {{a cross section of}} 2, 885 Danish households observed in 1996. The sample includes fulltime employed couples in single family houses. The specification of the model is guided by an explorative nonparametric data analysis. The analysis reveals, among other things, the fairly surprising result that <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> heating is unaffected by the number of children in the household. The dependence between <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> gas and <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> electricity is examined in the paper. This is done by testing <b>for</b> separability of <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> gas from <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> electricity, and vice versa. Separability of electricity (gas) from gas (electricity) is tested by estimating <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> electricity (gas) conditional on <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> gas (electricity). The model allows for endogeneity of the conditional variable. Building regulations and individual time variation, that is panel data, identify the test. The test indicates that <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> electricity is separable from <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> natural gas, and that <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> natural gas is separable from <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> electricity. The result of the test is evidence in favour of single equation modelling of household energy demand in this context. ...|$|R

In this paper, an AIDS model is used to analyse the responsiveness of China’s <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> wool imports and preferred sources of imports of wool. The results indicate that, in general, China’s <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> wool imports is not very responsive to changes in prices and expenditures. When <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> wool imports increases, China {{has a tendency to}} initially obtain imports from countries other than Australia. In the foreseeable future, it is unlikely that China’s <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> wool imports will experience significant increase.

50|$|One example {{involves}} spillovers {{from the}} labor market to the goods market. If there is labour market disequilibrium such that individuals cannot supply all the labor they want to supply, then the amount {{that they are able}} to supply will influence their <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> goods; the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> goods, contingent on the constraint on the amount of labor that can be supplied, is their effective <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> goods.
