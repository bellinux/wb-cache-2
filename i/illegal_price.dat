By September this had increased to three, and tickets were selling {{as low as}} NOK500. SAS responded with a 22-percent cut in ticket prices. Coast Air lost NOK11 million on the price war during 2003, and was ultimately forced {{to withdraw from the}} route in May 2004. The case was investigated by the Norwegian Competition Authority based on accusations of SAS carrying out <b>illegal</b> <b>price</b> dumping on the route. They issued a fine of NOK20 million, but the case ended in Oslo District Court, where Scandinavian Airlines was acquitted. Though initially appealed by the authority, the matter was settled out-of-court in December 2007, in which the airline agreed that they had broken the law, but that since it took place immediately the act came into power, they would not have to pay the fine.|$|E
25|$|On 2 June 2003, Coast Air {{started its}} first head-on {{competition}} with Scandinavian Airlines. Using the ATR planes, Coast Air started with two daily round services between Haugesund and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. By September, Coast Air increased to three daily round trips, and reduced prices to NOK500. From 9 October, Scandinavian Airlines reduced their prices by 22% {{on the route}}. On 16 February, Coast Air also started competing with Braathens and Widerøe on the route between Stavanger and Bergen, marketing it as a low-fare service and ticket prices as low as NOK199. The Haugesund–Oslo route cost Coast Air NOK11 million in 2003. In March 2004, Coast Air was forced to close the Stord to Oslo route, after several reductions in frequency during the past year. To create more inertia on the Bergen–Stavanger route, Coast Air also started a cooperation with DAT, where the latter flew an extra daily round trip. Following the losses of the Haugesund–Oslo and Bergen–Stavanger routes, they were terminated in May 2004. In December, the Norwegian Competition Authority started investigating Scandinavian Airlines for <b>illegal</b> <b>price</b> dumping on the Oslo–Haugesund route. The authority suspected that SAS had illegally cross-subsidized the route {{to fend off the}} competition, and announced the company would be fined NOK20 million. The case ended in Oslo District Court, where Scandinavian Airlines was found not guilty. Though initially appealed by the authority, the matter was settled out-of-court in December 2007, in which the airline agreed that they had broken the law, but that since it happened just after the act came into power, they would not have to pay the fine.|$|E

However, the jury ultimately found {{in favor of the}} Guardian and awarded it $6.4 million in damages, an amount that ballooned to $15.6 million after partial trebling.

40|$|In recent years, {{economists have}} paid much {{attention}} to the demand for alcohol and the negative externalities associated with excessive drinking. Largely ignored in the literature is the link between alcohol use and domestic violence. Given the established positive relationship between alcohol consumption and acts of violence, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to examine the role that changes in the determinants of the demand for alcohol may play in reducing the incidence of violence aimed at children. Data on violence come from the 1976 Physical Violence in American Families survey. We estimate a model in which violent outcomes are affected by the state excise tax rate on beer; <b>illegal</b> drug <b>prices,</b> and other regulatory variables such as availability measures and laws restricting the advertising of alcohol. Results show that increasing the tax on beer can be an effective policy tool in reducing violence. Laws designed to make obtaining beer more difficult also may be effective in reducing violence, while restrictions on advertising and increases in <b>illegal</b> drug <b>prices</b> have no effects.

40|$|Fierce {{competition}} abounds, extreme {{market segmentation}} is prevalent, and occupancy levels and profits are down throughout the hotel industry. As a partial {{response to these}} problems, the hotel industry has made significant changes in methods used to quote room prices and {{in the sale of}} its rooms through central or local reservation systems. To maximize revenue, many hotels have implemented yield management systems that adjust "room rates in response to the level of rooms booked for future arrival dates " (Relihan, 1989). Computer systems, sales incentive programs, and the retraining of reservation personnel and others are necessary in order to produce "the best possible return, or yield, from the space available " (Relihan, 1989). While the hotel management is attempting to boost revenues, they may be simultaneously and actively promoting discount programs to attract weekend guests, seniorcitizens, corporate accounts, government contracts, and families. Potential guests often respond to advertisements for reduced rate rooms and discount packages by calling the hotel reservation system. Seeking the advertised discount rate, they may come up against a newly installed yield management system whose purpose is to maximize revenue. This article will focus on yield management systems, {{some of the problems that}} have been recognized in the sale of advertised rooms at discount prices, and existing federal and state statutes regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. It will also examine how some in hotel management may be unknowingly violating these statutes.

We used international drug surveillance databases to assess the relationship between multiple long-term estimates of <b>illegal</b> drug <b>price</b> and purity.

Setting: Data from identified illegal drug surveillance systems were analysed using an a priori defined protocol in which we sought to present annual estimates beginning in 1990. Data were then subjected to trend analyses. Main outcome measures: Data were obtained from government surveillance systems assessing price, purity and/or seizure quantities of illegal drugs; systems with at least 10 years of longitudinal data assessing price, purity/potency or seizures were included. Results: We identified seven regional/international metasurveillance systems with longitudinal measures of price or purity/potency that met eligibility criteria.

5000|$|After {{his return}} to Harvard from {{government}} he teamed with Professor Areeda to author {{an important contribution to}} the jurisprudence of [...] "attempt to monopolize" [...] by predatory pricing under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The goal was to develop a bright line test (which became known as the Areeda-Turner test) to separate <b>illegal</b> <b>price</b> cutting designed to drive a competitor from the market, which would harm consumers once the monopolist was free to raise prices in the future, from healthy price competition, which is inherently pro-competitive and beneficial to the consumer. The point their test settled on is when the price set is below short term average variable cost, which is a more easily ascertained substitute for marginal cost. By this measure, a court can determine when a monopolist is deliberately setting a price which does not profit-maximizing (except for the profits to be achieved once a competitor is forced from the market).|$|E

Price was therefore not charged with infanticide, but was instead tried in a Cardiff courtroom for performing cremation rather than burial, which the police believed to be <b>illegal.</b> <b>Price</b> argued that while the law did not state that cremation was legal, it also did not state that it was illegal. The judge, Mr Justice Stephen (1829-1894), agreed. Price was freed, and returned to Llantrisant to find a crowd of supporters cheering for his victory. On 14 March, he was finally able to give his son a cremation involving his own personal Druidic prayers. The case set a precedent which, together with the activities of the newly founded Cremation Society of Great Britain, led to the Cremation Act of 1902.

This is consistent with our second finding that violence by females increases with alcohol consumption while violence by males is not sensitive to changes in consumption. ...|$|R
