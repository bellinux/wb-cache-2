5|$|After a punitive {{operation}} {{was conducted in}} the surrounding villages, during which 422males were shot and four villages burned <b>down,</b> <b>another</b> 70male Jews and communists who had been arrested in Kragujevac were shot. Simultaneously, males {{between the ages of}} 16and 60, including high school students, were assembled by German troops and local collaborators, and the victims were selected from amongst them. The selected males were then marched to fields outside the city, shot with heavy machine guns, and their bodies buried in mass graves. Contemporary German military records indicate that 2,300hostages were shot. After the war, inflated estimates ranged as high as 7,000deaths, but German and Serbian scholars have now agreed on the figure of nearly 2,800killed, including 144high school students. As well as Serbs, other massacre victims included Jews, Romani people, Muslims, Macedonians, Slovenes and members of other nationalities.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to her unit, Alaska continued to screen for the aircraft carriers off Okinawa. On 27 March she was detached to conduct a bombardment of Minamidaitō. She was joined by Guam, two light cruisers, and Destroyer Squadron 47. On the night of 2728 March, she fired forty-five 12-inch shells and three hundred and fifty-two 5-inch rounds at the island. The ships rejoined TG 58.4 at a refueling point, after which they returned to Okinawa to support the landings when they began on 1 April. On the evening of 11 April, Alaska shot down one Japanese plane, assisted {{in the destruction of}} another, and claimed what might have been an Ohka piloted rocket-bomb. On 16 April, the ship shot <b>down</b> <b>another</b> three aircraft and assisted with three others. Throughout the rest of the month, her heavy anti-aircraft fire succeeded in driving off Japanese bombers.|$|E
5|$|Between 1985 and 2007, only {{an average}} of 18 sockeye salmon {{returned}} to Idaho each year. Serious conservation efforts by wildlife biologists and fish hatcheries have captured the few remaining wild sockeye salmon, collected their sperm and eggs, and in a laboratory, have them spawn. Instead of spawning naturally, these sockeye begin their lives in an incubator in a fishery biologist's laboratory. These baby salmon then are transported by ship, bypassing the dams. (The dams can hurt juvenile baby sockeye salmon with their powerful tides and currents, which suck the baby salmon <b>down.)</b> <b>Another</b> conservation effort that has helped the salmon recover, is the destruction of old, outdated dams, such as the Lewiston Dam on the Clearwater River, {{a tributary of the}} Snake. After destroying the dam, salmon populations noticeably recovered.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Dunkirk the Command's {{aircraft}} flew bombing missions against enemy {{ports and}} covered the evacuation effort. On 31 May 1940, Pilot Officer P. Peters and his gunner LAC Pepper of No. 500 Squadron possibly shot down Coastal Command's first air-to-air victories of the war by dispatching two Messerschmitt Bf 109s trying to intercept them. No. 220 Squadron shot down four Junkers Ju 87 Stukas on 1 June, while Hudsons of No. 206 managed to shoot <b>down</b> <b>another</b> two Bf 109s. However, air-to-air combat was rare for Coastal Command. No. 22, 812 and 815 Squadrons engaged in mining operations off Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium. By {{the end of the}} Dunkirk evacuation on 4 June 1940, Coastal Command's No. 16 Group RAF had flown 327 sorties in direct and indirect support of the Army and Navy.|$|E
50|$|In September 1942, Robbins was {{assigned}} to 80th Fighter Squadron, 8th Fighter Group of the Fifth Air Force in the Southwest Pacific area.

5|$|Following Air Force's post-score kickoff {{and a short}} return by the Hokies, Virginia Tech's offense began a {{drive at}} its 28-yard line. A five-yard false-start penalty pushed the Tech offense back five yards, but a long run by quarterback Mark Cox made up the penalty and earned Tech a first <b>down.</b> <b>Another</b> first down followed, and Tech {{penetrated}} into the Air Force side of the field. Once there, Eddie Hunter evaded Falcon defenders for a 33-yard run that took the Hokies inside Air Force's 20-yard line. Three more plays pushed Tech forward, inside Air Force's five-yard line, for a first down. On the next play, Maurice Williams ran forward, into the end zone. The touchdown and extra point gave Virginia Tech a 73 lead with 1:42 left in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Marseille had {{a narrow}} escape on 13 May 1942, when his Bf 109 was damaged during a dogfight with 12 Kittyhawks (Mk I) from No. 3 Squadron RAAF, {{southeast}} of Gazala {{and over the}} Gulf of Bomba ("Gazala Bay"). With a wingman, Marseille bounced the Kittyhawks. After he downed one of the Australian pilots, Flying Officer Graham Pace in AL172, Marseille's Bf 109 took hits in the oil tank and propeller, likely from Flying Officer Geoff Chinchen, who reported damaging one of the Messerschmitts. Marseille nevertheless managed to shoot <b>down</b> <b>another</b> Kittyhawk (Sergeant Colin McDiarmid; AK855), before nursing his overheating aircraft back to base. The repairs to Marseille's Bf 109 took two days. The aerial victories were recorded as numbers 57–58.|$|E

In the Gjirokastër area, Pattle shot down an IMAM Ro.37bis from 42a Squadriglia, 72o Gruppo, and Sergente Luigi Del Manno and his observer, Tenente Michele Milano, were both killed. In the afternoon, Pattle shot <b>down</b> <b>another</b> Ro.37bis from 72oGruppo near Permet, killing Capitano Fuchs and Sergente Vescia. On 4 December 1940, the RAF claimed nine Fiat CR.42s destroyed and two probables. Pattle — whose own aircraft {{was hit in}} the main fuel tank and a wing strut — claimed three CR.42s plus another and a Fiat CR.42 as probable victories — he had seen two of his victims bail out. According to Italian combat records, 150° Gruppo, involved in that combat, lost just two CR.42s. Tenente Alberto Triolo and Sottotenente Paolo Penna were killed in action.|$|E

Feldwebels Hans Troitzsch and Alfred Held each claimed a victory and Leutnant Metz another. These {{aircraft}} from No. 9 Squadron were the first RAF aircraft to have been shot down by enemy fighters {{during the war and}} Troitzsch was most likely to have been the first enemy pilot to shoot one <b>down.</b> <b>Another</b> four Blenheims of No. 107 Squadron were shot down by anti-aircraft artillery fire. The Germans believed their air defences had established an effective defence from Allied attack. Use of the early Freya radar had given the German fighters eight minutes warning of their approach.|$|E
5|$|The first {{engagement}} of Hull's command, on 2 September, resulted {{in three of}} the squadron's Hurricanes being shot down in return for two Messerschmitt Bf109s. On 4 September, Hull led a group of Hurricanes in a decisive aerial victory over coastal Sussex against a large group of Bf110s from ZGs2 and76. Flight Lieutenant Thomas Dalton-Morgan destroyed a Bf110 north of Worthing and chased another until it crashed near Shoreham-by-Sea, while Sergeant Jeffreys shot <b>down</b> <b>another</b> Bf110 in a field. Pilot Officer AEA van den Hove d'Ertsenrijck, from Belgium, pursued a fourth back out to sea and sent it crashing into the English Channel, but was hit himself and compelled to make an emergency landing at RAF Ford. Hull and Flight Officer Hamilton Upton together seriously damaged two more Bf110s.|$|E
5|$|Cordyline australis is a light-demanding pioneer species, and {{seedlings}} die when overtopped {{by other}} trees. To grow well, young plants require open space {{so they are}} not shaded out by other vegetation. Another requirement is water during the seedling stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply of water to survive. This stops the species from growing in sand dunes unless there are wet depressions present, and from hillsides {{unless there is a}} seepage area. The fertility of the soil is another factor—settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The fallen leaves of the tree also help to raise the fertility of the soil when they break <b>down.</b> <b>Another</b> factor is temperature, especially the degree of frost. Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut back. This is why C.australis is absent from upland areas and from very frosty inland areas.|$|E
