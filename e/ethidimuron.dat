40|$|AbstractThe {{fate of the}} 14 C-labeled {{herbicides}} <b>ethidimuron</b> (ETD), methabenzthiazuron (MBT), and the fungicide anilazine (ANI) in soils {{was evaluated}} after long-term aging (9 – 17 years) in field based lysimeters subject to crop rotation. Analysis of residual 14 C activity in the soils revealed 19 % (ETD soil; 0 – 10  cm depth), 35 % (MBT soil; 0 – 30), and 43 % (ANI soil; 0 – 30) of the total initially applied. Accelerated solvent extraction yielded 90 % (ETD soil), 26 % (MBT soil), and 41 % (ANI soil) of residual pesticide 14 C activity in the samples. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed the parent compounds ETD and MBT, accounting for 3 % and 2 % of applied active ingredient in the soil layer, as well as dihydroxy-anilazine as the primary ANI metabolite. The results for ETD and MBT were matching with values obtained from samples of a 12 year old field plot experiment. The data demonstrate the long-term persistence of these pesticides in soils based on outdoor trials...|$|E

A laboratory experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of soil drying and wetting on the release of pesticide residues. Soil containing environmentally long-term aged (9 - 17 years) (14) C-labeled residues of the herbicides <b>ethidimuron</b> (ETD) and methabenzthiazuron (MBT) and the fungicide anilazine (ANI) showed a significantly higher release of (14) C activity in water extracts of previously dried soil compared to constantly moistened soil throughout all samples (ETD: p < 0. 1, MBT and ANI: p < 0. 01). The extracted (14) C activity accounted for 44 % (ETD), 15 % (MBT), and 20 % (ANI) of total residual (14) C activity in the samples after 20 successive dry-wet cycles, in contrast to 15 % (ETD), 5 % (MBT), and 6 % (ANI) in extracts of constantly moistened soils. In the dry-wet soils, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content correlated with the measured (14) C activity in the aqueous liquids and indicated a potential association of DOC with the pesticide molecules. Liquid chromatography MS/MS analyses of the water extracts of dry-wet soils revealed ETD and MBT in detectable amounts, accounting for 1. 83 and 0. 01 %, respectively, of total applied water-extractable parent compound per soil layer.

40|$|How can {{leaching}} risk {{be assessed}} if the chemical flux and/or the toxicity is highly uncertain? For many strongly sorbing pesticides {{it is known}} that their transport through the unsaturated zone occurs intermittently through preferential flow, triggered by significant rainfall events. In these circumstances the timing and frequency of these rainfall events may allow quantification of leaching risk to overcome the limitations of flux prediction. In this paper we analyze the leaching behavior of bromide and two herbicides, methabenzthiazuron and <b>ethidimuron,</b> using data from twelve uncropped lysimeters, with high-resolution climate data, in order to identify the rainfall controls on rapid solute leaching. A regression tree analysis suggested that a coarse-scale fortnightly to monthly water balance was a good predictor of short-term increases in drainage and bromide transport. Significant short-term herbicide leaching, however, was better predicted by the occurrence of a single storm with a depth greater than a 19 mm threshold. Sampling periods where rain events exceeded this threshold accounted for between 38 % and 56 % of the total mass of herbicides leached during the experiment. The same threshold only accounted for between 1 % and 10 % of the total mass of bromide leached. On the basis of these results, we conclude that in this system, the leaching risks of strongly sorbing chemicals can be quantified by the timing and frequency of these large rainfall events. Empirical and modeling approaches are suggested to apply this frequentist approach to leaching risk assessment to other soil-climate systems...|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} method {{has been developed}} for the quantification of two herbicides (<b>ethidimuron</b> and methabenzthiazuron) and their two main soil derivatives. This method involves fluidized-bed extraction (FBE) prior to cleanup and analysis by reverse-phase liquid chromatography with UV detection at 282 nm. FBE conditions were established to provide efficient extraction without degradation of the four analytes. (14) C-labeled compounds {{were used for the}} optimization of extraction and purification steps and for the determination of related efficiencies. Extraction was optimal using a fexIKA extractor operating at 110 degrees C for three cycles (total time = 95 min) with 75 g of soil and 150 mL of a 60 : 40 v/v acetone/water mixture. Extracts were further purified on a 500 mg silica SPE cartridge. Separation was performed on a C 18 Purosphere column (250 mm x 4 mm i. d.), at 0. 8 mL min(- 1) and 30 degrees C with an elution gradient made up of phosphoric acid aqueous solution (pH 2. 2) and acetonitrile. Calibration curves were found to be linear in the 0. 5 - 50 mg L(- 1) concentration range. Besides freshly spiked soil samples, method validation included the analysis of samples with aged residues. Recovery values, determined from spiked samples, were close to 100 %. Limits of detection ranged between 2 and 3 microg kg(- 1) of dry soil and limits of quantification between 8 and 10 microg kg(- 1) of dry soil. An attempt to improve these performances by using fluorescence detection following postcolumn derivatization by orthophthalaldehyde-mercaptoethanol reagent was unsuccessful...|$|E
40|$|In Germany, zero-tension lysimeters {{are used}} as parr of the {{registration}} requirements in case pesticides pose a potential threat to conrtaminate the groundwater However, the water regime and the method of pesticide sampling differ between the lysimeters and the field We monitored the transport of the two herbicides <b>ethidimuron</b> [1 -(5 - erhylsulfonyl- 1, 3, 4 -thiadiazol- 1 - 2 -yl) - 1, 3 -dimethylurea] (ETD) and methabenzthiazuron [1 -benzothiazol- 2 -yl- 1, 3 -dimethyl-urea] (MBT) and their main metabolite, accompanied with bromide as conservative tracer, in zero-tension lysimeters filled with undisturbed soil and in the field The herbicides were applied as a short pulse to the bare soil surface Herbicide concentrations were analyzed in the drainage water of the 1 2 -m-deep lysimeters and from soil cores taken from the field during six campaigns Soil coring in the field emphasized matrix flow and allowed us to estimate the field-based dissipation and sorption parameters Based on mass recovery calculations, the field fine was 870 d for ETD compared with 389 d for its main metabolite The initially fast field-based dissipation of MBT with a half-life value of approximately 1 mo {{was followed by a}} much slower dissipation The retardation factor was estimated from the concentration profiles by Inversely solving the convection dispersion equation and yielded 18 2 +/- 1. 3 for ETD and 36 9 +/- 17 5 for MBT For the lysimeters, a leaching period of 2 1 / 2 yr was too short to monitor bulk herbicide mass through the sod matrix Only 1. 7 % of the applied EDT and 1 4 % of the applied MBT were sampled in the drainage water at 1. 2 m depth. Despite contrasting sorption and dissipation properties. both herbicides appeared fast {{and at the same time}} in the drainage water, hinting at preferential flow phenomena. Compared with field fare of herbicides measured by soil coring, zero-potential lysimeters emphasize the transport of small amounts of herbicides triggered by preferential flow events. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2 Increased {{amounts of}} {{pesticide}} production {{and application of}} pesticides for agriculture, plant protection and animal health has resulted in soil, water and air pollution, consequently relating a serious risk {{to the environment and}} also to human health. Pesticides include several groups of compounds, herbicides, insecticides, rodenticides and fumigants consisting of several hundred individual chemicals. Herbicides are an integral pan of modem agriculture and for industries requiring total vegetation control. Most herbicides are soil applied and more and more concern is raised that herbicides not only affect target organisms but also the microbial community present in soil. The ESKOM sub-station Zeus, in Mpumalanga (South Africa) used to apply an industrial weed control program for the eradication of vegetation, which led to the contamination of soil by several herbicides. These herbicides consisted of Bromacil, Tebuthiuron and <b>Ethidimuron</b> which are all photosynthesis inhibitors, more specifically, they disrupt the plastoquinone protein during electron transport at photosystem I 1 (PSII). In this study the effect of biostimulation and bio-augmentation of a specific bioremediation agent (B 350) as prescribed by ESKOM, on residual herbicides, Bromacil, Tebuthiuron and <b>Ethidimuron</b> was evaluated by monitoring the soil physical and chemical properties, microbial attributes, including potential microbial activity and community structure, as well as the physiological effect experienced by plants (Cynodoh dactylon and Zea mays). Results from soil physical and chemical analyses were correlated with results obtained for the functional and structural diversity of microbial communities. All results were investigated through statistical and multivariate analysis and the most prominent soil physical and chemical parameters that influence the biological and biochemical properties of the soil were identified. Results obtained from this study indicated that there were no significant difference (p < 0. 05) between the treatments, with bioremediation agent, irradiated agent and without the agent based on results obtained from soil microbial properties and plant physiology. Before the trial started the uncontaminated soil showed an active microbial function, characterised by dehydrogenase, urease and arylsulphatase activity, but community structure was not very diverse. The contaminated soil, irradiated contaminated soil and silica sand showed less enzymatic function and was characterised by phospholipid fatty acid groups, mid-branched saturated fatty acids, terminally branched saturated fatty acids, normal saturated fatty acids and monosaturated fatty acids which are indicative of microorganisms that survive better in harsh environments. Three weeks after the addition of the specific bioremediation took place, the uncontaminated soil showed an increase in P-glucosidase activity and percentage organic carbon (%C), which could be a result of the presence of available plant material. Furthermore, an increase in major PLFA groups were seen, suggesting that an increase in diversity within the soil community occurred. The contaminated soil, irradiated contaminated soil and silica sand once again was characterised by a low microbial function and diversity, showing no improvement. Fluorescence data clearly show a decline in PS 11 function that result in the decline of the rate of photosynthesis, which was seen from COz gas exchange rates. Furthermore, the decrease in photosynthetic activity after three weeks was too severe to supply additional information about the mechanism within photosynthesis or the photoprotective mechanisms. A detailed study was conducted in which a 3 : 1 dilution of contaminated soil with silica sand, was also monitored for changes within plant physiology. Results revealed that inhibition of PS I 1 function already takes place within a few days time and the decline in photosynthesis is as a result of electron transport that does not supply adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and P-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADPH) to the Calvin cycle (or Reductive Pentose Phosphate pathway). It does not appear that rubulose- 1,sbisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) is affected within the Calvin cycle. As a result of PS I 1 function failure, reaction centres are damaged by the production of harmful singlet oxygen and photoprotective mechanisms (xanthophyll cycle) can not be activated. Thus, except for dealing with ineffective electron transport, additional damage is caused to physiological functions. After six weeks a decrease in the estimated viable biomass for all growth mediums was found. Results of the of trans- to cis- monoenoic fatty acids and cyclopropyl fatty acids to their monoenoic precursors ratios indicated that the soil microbial community for the contaminated growth mediums, all experienced nutritional stress throughout this trail. The specific bioremediation agent (B 350) used, seemed to have no effect on the microbial function and community structure within soil and as agent had no effect on the residual herbicides or the plant physiology which experienced an extreme decline in major metabolic functions.
