5|$|On 28 September 1990, the Division Support Command {{deployed}} to the Middle East {{in support of}} Operation Desert Shield. In January 1991, Division Support Command provided support to the 1st Cavalry Division throughout Operation Desert Storm, leading to a quick liberation of Kuwait. On 16 December 1991, the 215th <b>Forward</b> <b>Support</b> Battalion was activated at Fort Hood bringing the number of active duty <b>forward</b> <b>support</b> battalions to three.

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, the DISCOM {{consisted}} of a Headquarters Company, a Division Materiel Management Center, a Division Data Center, the 15th Medical Battalion, 15th Adjutant General Battalion, 15th Finance Company, 15th Supply and Transport Battalion, 27th Maintenance Battalion and the 68th Chemical Company. In October 1984, the 1st and 2nd <b>Forward</b> <b>Support</b> Battalions were activated from elements of the three functional battalions attached to the unit. The following year saw the Army of Excellence Reorganization (AOE) transform the remaining elements of the three functional battalions (maintenance, medical, and supply and transport) into the 4th Main Support Battalion. The AOE reorganization also added the 493rd Transportation Company (Aircraft Maintenance) to the Division Support Command. The forward and main support battalions, along with the Aviation Maintenance Company, were redesignated in 1987, becoming the 15th and 115th <b>Forward</b> <b>Support</b> Battalions, 27th Main Support Battalion, and 227th Transportation Company (Aviation Maintenance).|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the DISCOM was {{deployed}} to Turkey {{in support of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom I. The DISCOM simultaneously supported peacekeeping operations in the Balkans and deployed a logistics task force to support Operation Iraqi Freedom I throughout Iraq. In 2004, the DISCOM re{{deployed to}} Southwest Asia in Support of Operation Iraqi Freedom II. In addition to the organic DISCOM units, the 225th <b>Forward</b> <b>Support</b> Battalion from Hawaii and the 230th Support Battalion from North Carolina deployed to support logistical operations for Task Force Danger. Finally, in 2005, the DISCOM redeployed to Germany to reconstitute and prepare for future contingency operations.

5|$|The brigade was {{reactivated}} in 1986 at Fort Drum, New York, {{as part of}} {{the third}} Light Infantry Division in the new Army of Excellence force structure. The 1st Brigade consisted of three organic battalions: 1–32nd Infantry, 1–87th Infantry, and 2–22nd Infantry.

This complex is then used in Novikov theory, to obtain a geometric realization of the Novikov Complex as a complex of currents and a new characterization of Novikov Homology as cohomology with compact <b>forward</b> <b>supports.</b> Two natural “backward-forward ” dualities are also established: a Lambda duality over the Novikov Ring and a Topological Vector Space duality over the reals...|$|R

25|$|The V-1 was {{transformed}} into the Reichenberg by adding a small, cramped cockpit {{at the point of}} the fuselage that was immediately ahead of the pulsejet's intake, where the standard V-1's compressed-air cylinders were fitted. The cockpit had basic flight instruments and a plywood bucket seat. The single-piece canopy incorporated an armoured front panel and opened to the side to allow entry. The two displaced compressed-air cylinders were replaced by a single one, fitted in the rear in the space which normally accommodated the V-1's autopilot. The wings were fitted with hardened edges to cut the cables of barrage balloons.

25|$|MTU-20 (Ob'yekt 602) (Tankoviy Mostoukladchik) - T-54 {{converted}} into a bridge-layer tank. It has a twin-treadway superstructure mounted on a modified chassis. Each treadway {{is made up of}} a box-type aluminum girder with a folding ramp attached to both ends to save space while the bridge is in the travel position. The vehicle with the bridge in the traveling position is 11.6 m long. When set up, the bridge is 20 m long. This is an increase of about 62% over that of the older MTU-1. The bridge is launched using the cantilever method. First, the ramps are lowered and fully extended before the treadways are forward with the full load of the bridge resting on the <b>forward</b> <b>support</b> plate during launch. The span is moved out over the launching girder until the far end reaches the far bank. Next, the near end is lowered onto the near bank. This method of launching gives the bridgelayer a low silhouette, which makes it less vulnerable to detection and destruction.|$|E

On June 18, 1968, Burge volunteered for duty in Vietnam a second time, and was assigned to the Ninth Military Police Company of the Ninth Infantry Division. He reported to division headquarters, where he was assigned to provide security as a sergeant at his division base camp, which was named Đồng Tâm by William Westmoreland.

The brigade served mainly in Kirkuk for the next year. During its service, the brigade was involved in what later {{became known as the}} [...] "Hood Event", arresting Turkish special forces soldiers, believing them to be plotting attacks against local civilian officials in northern Iraq. The Turkish forces were eventually released. The brigade also participated in Operation Bayonet Lightning in 2003, capturing weapons and materials that the Department of Defense claimed were possibly for use against coalition forces.
