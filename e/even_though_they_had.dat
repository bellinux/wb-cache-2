5|$|All the {{structures}} in Old Yosemite Village, {{except for the}} chapel, were either moved to the Pioneer Yosemite History center in Wawona or demolished during the 1950s and 1960s. Other structures in the park were also moved to the history center. Cedar Cottage, the oldest building in Yosemite Valley, was demolished in 1941 along with others, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> not been flooded. Little regard was given to historic preservation, as the priority {{was thought to be}} the preservation and restoration of natural scenery.|$|E
5|$|Initially Boutonnat and Dahan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to find a record company who would release the track, either because labels were worried about the song being censored due to the sexual nature of its lyrics or because they did not see any commercial potential in the track. In order to get a second appointment with RCA records the pair claimed they had remixed the song, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> not. Only after a third appointment with RCA did the label's Francis Dacla give them a contract.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{indirect}} and intangible {{costs of the}} eruption. Unemployment in the immediate region of Mount St. Helens rose tenfold in the weeks immediately following the eruption, {{and then returned to}} near-normal levels once timber-salvaging and ash-cleanup operations were underway. Only a small percentage of residents left the region because of lost jobs owing to the eruption. Several months after May 18, a few residents reported suffering stress and emotional problems, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> coped successfully during the crisis. Counties in the region requested funding for mental health programs to assist such people.|$|E

5|$|After {{watching}} Greg for hours, Leslie and Dave {{decide to}} go to Ann's party. They stop at the parks department to get Leslie's costume, {{only to find the}} office has been toilet papered and vandalized. Leslie immediately suspects Greg, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been watching him all night. Dave reluctantly agrees to bring Greg in for questioning, but Greg insists he is innocent. Andy comes in and questions Greg, pretending to be an FBI agent named Burt Macklin, but Greg is so mean to him Andy soon starts crying. Greg's mother eventually arrives and takes him away after threatening to report the trio for holding her son without proof of his guilt.|$|E
5|$|From the Permian, {{numerous}} stem group {{representatives of}} mayflies are known, {{which are often}} lumped into a separate taxon Permoplectoptera (e.g. including Protereisma permianum in the Protereismatidae, and Misthodotidae). The larvae of Permoplectoptera still had 9 pairs of abdominal gills, and the adults still had long hindwings. Maybe the fossil family Cretereismatidae from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil also belongs as the last offshoot to Permoplectoptera. The Crato outcrops otherwise yielded fossil specimens of modern mayfly families or the extinct (but modern) family Hexagenitidae. However, from the same locality the strange larvae and adults of the extinct family Mickoleitiidae (order Coxoplectoptera) have been described, which represents the fossil sister group of modern mayflies, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> very peculiar adaptations such as raptorial forelegs.|$|E

Lawyers have notified competitors using the name to surrender their websites and Facebook accounts marketing under the trademark, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been using these names for many years. The Desborough Ritz, which had been using the name since the 1930s, changed its name in 2012 after being advised by solicitors to do so. That same year, a Northamptonshire wedding location named The Ritz {{changed its name to}} the Banqueting & Conference Suites at the Kettering Ritz after another notification. The Brighouse Ritz, which has operated under the name since 1938, was notified in 2017 to change its name or face legal action.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, the Daily Mirror {{newspaper}} printed {{pictures of}} Arsenal fans {{alleged to have}} been part of the violence. It later arose that the majority of the people in the photos were either not involved or had been acting in self-defence. The photos led to some postmen working for Royal Mail losing their jobs because they had been seen in the photos and in television coverage, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> not been arrested. Michael Doherty, the chairman of the Communication Workers Union, and his brother Tom took Royal Mail to an Employment Tribunal for unfair dismissal claiming they had been acting in self-defence. In 2001, the tribunal ruled in their favour, and ordered Royal Mail to reinstate them. In 2012, the editor of the Daily Mirror at the time, Piers Morgan apologised for printing the pictures.|$|E
5|$|Sahajanand Swami {{was later}} known as Swaminarayan after the mantra he taught at a gathering, in Faneni, a {{fortnight}} {{after the death}} of Ramanand Swami. He gave his followers a new mantra, known as the Swaminarayan mantra, to repeat in their rituals: Swaminarayan. When chanting this mantra, some devotees went into samadhi (a form of meditation) This act is also called maha-samadhi ("great samadhi") and claimed that they could see their personal gods, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> no knowledge of Astanga Yoga. Swaminarayan also became known by the names Ghanshyam Maharaj, Shreeji Maharaj, Hari Krishna Maharaj and Shri Hari. As early as 1804, Swaminarayan, who was reported to have performed miracles, was described as a manifestation of God in the first work written by a disciple and paramhansa, Nishkulanand Swami. This work, the Yama Danda, was the first piece of literature written within the Swaminarayan sect.|$|E
5|$|While at Princeton, she got {{involved}} with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group that supported minority students, running their day care center, which also included after school tutoring. She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt {{that it should be}} more conversational. As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a thesis titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community. She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African American graduates, requesting they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded, and her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African American community, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> attended an elite university with all of the advantages that accrues to its graduates. She majored in sociology and minored in African American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985.|$|E

5|$|Sir John Neville {{was from}} the branch of the Neville family based at Middleham Castle in Yorkshire, rather than that of Westmorland. It has been claimed that he, as a 'landless younger son' was {{partially}} to blame for his family's long-running feud with the Lancastrian Percy family of Northumberland. The first outburst of violence that took place {{was a result of}} the 1 May 1453 royal licence for John Neville's brother, Thomas Neville to marry Maud Stanhope being issued. News of this must have reached the north within the fortnight, for by the twelfth, one of the Earl of Northumberland's younger sons, Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont, began recruiting men. In August 1453, John Neville raided the Percy castle of Topcliffe, possibly with the intention of seizing Egremont. Failing to find him, Neville resorted to threatening the Percy tenantry who were in residence. He and Egremont were subsequently summoned to appear before the Royal Council, a summons which was ignored by both. Feuding continued through summer 1453, and <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been instructed to keep the peace, by the 27 July, the council was issuing letters to Northumberland and Salisbury regarding their sons. This was followed by more letters to the sons. In Knaresborough, the locals generally aligned themselves with John Neville due to the unpopularity of Sir William Plumpton (the king's man), from whom they began stealing with impunity, which resulted in severe injuries when the Neville brothers demonstrated a 'show of force' in January 1454.|$|E
25|$|In 197, Yu Jin {{accompanied}} Cao Cao on {{a campaign}} against the warlord Zhang Xiu in Wan (宛; or Wancheng, in present-day Wancheng District, Nanyang, Henan). Zhang Xiu initially surrendered and pledged allegiance to Cao Cao, but rebelled later and defeated Cao in a surprise attack. There was chaos and disorder in Cao Cao's forces as they retreated to Wuyin (舞陰; northwest of present-day Qinyang, Henan). Only Yu Jin led his unit to continue fighting the pursuing enemy while maintaining an orderly retreat to Wuyin. They managed to stay together <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> sustained many casualties and losses. When Zhang Xiu's forces slowed down on their pursuit, Yu Jin reorganised his men and led them towards Wuyin in a dignified manner <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> lost the battle.|$|E

25|$|The Isaurians were {{a people}} who lived inland from the Mediterranean coast of Anatolia, {{in the core of}} the Taurus Mountains (generally what is now the Konya/Bozkir area of Turkey).

25|$|The Toronto Blue Jays took {{a chance}} by signing Burnett to a five-year deal despite his being prone to injuries, and the 2006 season began with him going on the {{disabled}} list when a piece of scar tissue—remnants of his Tommy John surgery—broke off in his pitching arm. However, some baseball commentators like RotoWorld and Tim Dierkes still considered the signing worthwhile, since many of the other free agent pitchers that year, like Matt Morris and Paul Byrd had less impressive career stats, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> fewer health risks.|$|E
