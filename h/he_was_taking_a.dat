5|$|To {{promote the}} album, Miguel {{launched}} his Tour America 1996 where he toured in South American countries including: Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil. According to his promoter Irma Laura Lopez, Miguel would not {{tour in the}} United States as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> break from his previous tour in the country. His set list consisted of pop tunes and ballads from Nada Es Igual.. and his previous recordings as well as boleros from the Romance albums.|$|E
5|$|Citing his {{disappointment}} at failing to gain promotion, Stimson resigned {{from his post}} at Grays on 16 May 2006. He stated {{that at the time}} he had received no firm job offers from other clubs, and acknowledged that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> gamble with his career, but said that if he was unable to find a new job as a manager he would move into youth coaching or open his own football school. He was linked with the managerial vacancy at League Two Peterborough United, but eventually took over as manager of Stevenage Borough on 28 May, and led the club to an eighth-place finish in the Conference National in his first season in charge. Stevenage also defeated Stimson's former club Grays to reach the FA Trophy final, and beat Kidderminster Harriers 3–2 at the new Wembley Stadium in the final, giving Stimson a third consecutive Trophy win as a manager.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Bolton {{finished}} {{sixth in}} the league, thus earning qualification for the UEFA Cup {{for the first time}} in their history. The following season, they reached the last 32 but were eliminated by French team Marseille as they lost 2–1 on aggregate. Between 2003–04 and 2006–07, Bolton recorded consecutive top-eight finishes, a record of consistency bettered only by the big four of Chelsea, Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal. Towards the end of the 06–07 season, long-serving manager Sam Allardyce departed the club, stating that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> sabbatical; he would be hired shortly thereafter as manager of Newcastle United. Allardyce later cited a lack of ambition on the part of the club's board for his departure; he had sought financial backing in January 2007 to push the club towards Champions League qualification, which he had not received.|$|E

25|$|During {{his time}} in the U.S. Senate, Feingold gained a {{reputation}} as a political maverick with an independent streak. When he broke with his own party, it was often because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> more liberal or populist position than other Democrats. Throughout his congressional tenure, several ranking systems placed Feingold among the nation's most liberal or progressive senators.|$|E
25|$|According to Lazar Fleishman, Pasternak {{was aware}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> huge risk. No Soviet author had {{attempted}} to deal with Western publishers since the 1920s, when such behavior led the Soviet State to declare war on Boris Pilnyak and Evgeny Zamyatin. Pasternak, however, believed that Feltrinelli's Communist affiliation would not only guarantee publication, but might even force the Soviet State to publish the novel in Russia.|$|E

25|$|Isaac Woodard, Jr. (March 18, 1919 – September 23, 1992) was an African American World War II veteran.

25|$|MacDonald at Meaux {{was unable}} {{to carry out his}} orders to advance because he had {{destroyed}} the Trilport bridge. His subordinate Horace François Bastien Sébastiani de La Porta {{was unable to}} move because Sacken had broken the La Ferté-sous-Jouarre bridge. MacDonald sent his cavalry under Antoine Louis Decrest de Saint-Germain to join Napoleon via Coulommiers. Napoleon again ordered MacDonald to seize Château-Thierry, so that the Allied retreat would be blocked. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> gamble. Napoleon intended to pursue Sacken and Yorck with maximum forces, hoping to trap them against the Marne. He also needed to consider that Blücher was positioned to the east with 20,000 men and 80 guns. Though the emperor began getting calls for help from Victor, he calculated that the unaggressive Schwarzenberg would move slowly while he dealt with Blücher's army. The Battle of Château-Thierry would be fought on 12 February.|$|E

25|$|As {{with so many}} late Elizabethan {{conspiracy}} theories Spanish calculations may have been of less importance {{than those of the}} queen's councillors. At the outset in 1599 Essex had realised <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> risk in departing the court and leaving the field open to Cecil, a risk that would pay off only if he defeated O'Neill. The Irish campaign proved far more difficult than anticipated - Essex was the last English commander of the age to underestimate rebel capability - and the situation at court deteriorated rapidly, with Cecil gaining an overwhelming influence over the queen. The private parley with O'Neill was especially significant at a time when Cecil was preparing the succession of the Scots king, James VI, to Elizabeth's throne. Essex's flight from Ireland was a desperate attempt to interfere with those preparations, and once this had failed his subsequent treason was down to his refusal to accept that it was Cecil, and not he, who would determine the succession.|$|E
25|$|Strauss {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut in 1998, and his One Day International (ODI) debut in Sri Lanka in 2003. He quickly rose to fame on his Test match debut replacing the injured Michael Vaughan at Lord's against New Zealand in 2004. With scores of 112 and 83 (run out) in an England victory, {{and the man}} of the match award, he became only the fourth batsman to score a century at Lord's on his debut and was close to becoming the first Englishman to score centuries in both innings of his debut. Strauss again nearly scored two centuries (126 and 94 not out) and was named man of the match in his first overseas Test match, in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in December 2004. Strauss suffered a drop in form during 2007, and as a result he was left out of the Test squad for England's tour of Sri Lanka, and announced that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> break from cricket. After a poor tour for England, Strauss was recalled into the squad for the 2008 tour of New Zealand and subsequently re-established himself in the side with a career-best 177 in the third and final Test of that series, and a further three centuries in 2008.|$|E

500|$|The {{same year}} saw the {{controversial}} {{transfer of the}} Barcelona vice-captain Luís Figo to arch-rivals Real Madrid. When Figo returned to the Camp Nou with his new club in November 2002, the Boixos responded to Figo's perceived treachery by whistling and jeering whenever he went near the ball. The abuse peaked when the Boixos threw a severed pig's head at him, while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> corner. The match has since been known in Spain as the [...] "Partido de la Vergüenza" [...] (...) [...] It was suspended for 13 minutes by the referee, who took the players off the pitch because of fears for their safety. It ended in a 0–0 draw.|$|E

In a further twist of synchronicity, in the same week Stevens announced <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> break from race riding due to the need for a total knee replacement. [...] Ritvo explained that Mucho Macho Man was sound, but [...] "fter five seasons of training and racing, he shows signs of some minor wear and tear.
