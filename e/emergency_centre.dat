5|$|Portions of {{the country}} faced {{shortages}} of rice due to crop damage from Ernest, {{as well as from}} Cyclone Gafilo in the previous year. This caused prices to increase, resulting in street protests. As a result, the World Food Programme provided 45tons of rice to affected residents, although persistent flooding disrupted relief work. In general, damage from Ernest and Felapi were less than that from Gafilo in the previous year. Madagascar's National <b>Emergency</b> <b>Centre</b> deployed workers to do search and rescue missions and provide water to storm victims.|$|E

The building had been inspected by the fire department, first in February 1976, {{and later in the}} beginning of 1977, after which the hotel's management was notified in writing that there were severe fire safety defects.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the case mix and workload of patients presenting to three private <b>emergency</b> <b>centres</b> in Cape Town Design: A Prospective cross sectional observational study was undertaken Setting and subjects: A {{convenience sample of}} all prospective patients that presented to three private <b>emergency</b> <b>centres</b> namely Melomed Gatesville, Melomed Bellville and Melomed Mitchell's plain {{during the month of}} September 2013 The outcome measures included the following:- ● Determining basic metrics across all three units over study time ● Determining the triage parameters for patients sampled across three units ● Direct time study of patients through unit ● Determining Doctor to patient workloads ● Determining Nurse to patient workloads ● Determining average number of patients receiving special investigations Results: Third party funding was responsible for 91 % of patients seen. The patient profiles consisted primarily of lower acuity presentations. There were clear peaks of attendance with lower acuity presentations decreasing after 10 pm. The majority of patients were discharged and very few required specialist follow up. Conclusions: This study provides valuable information with regards to private <b>emergency</b> <b>centres</b> in the predominantly low income and low socio economic sectors of the Western Cape, Cape town thus allowing a greater focus on the operational aspects of <b>Emergency</b> <b>Centres</b> In these areas and to assist with future planning of the management and running of similar <b>Emergency</b> <b>Centres...</b>|$|R

25|$|Within {{one week}} of the crash, cash {{payments}} ranging from $1,000 to $3,700 (all figures in this article in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated) were given to passengers for interim emergency use. These funds were given to passengers through an <b>emergency</b> <b>centre</b> {{set up in the}} Novotel Hotel in Mississauga, near the airport. These payments were independent of the claims process, which has been started for passengers who have not retained counsel. It is expected that the insurers of Air France will pay for all damages as well as extra compensation for having passengers go through the ordeal; however, only amounts of €6,000 to €9,000 have been offered, prompting passengers to turn to the lawsuit to seek legal action. The insurance is handled by the Societé de Gestion & D'Expertises D'Assurances in France. All passengers have also been offered a free round-trip ticket to any Air France destination in the world in the same fare class in which they were originally booked on AF358.|$|E

2500|$|The Central Gippsland bushfires {{began in}} a pine {{plantation}} [...] southeast of Churchill at about 1:30pm {{on the afternoon of}} 7February. Within 30 minutes it had spread to the southeast, threatening Hazelwood South, Jeeralang, and Budgeree East, and by late afternoon the fire was approaching Yarram and Woodside on the south Gippsland coast. The cool change came through the area about 6:00pm, but the southwesterly winds it brought pushed the fire northeast through Callignee, destroying 57 of its 61 homes. The fire continued on to Koornalla and Traralgon South, and towards Gormandale and Willung South on the Hyland Highway. About 500 evacuees from the area sheltered at an <b>emergency</b> <b>centre</b> established in a theatre in Traralgon.|$|E
2500|$|On January 26, 2011 (Australia Day), Buffett was {{performing}} {{a concert in}} Australia at Sydney's Hordern Pavilion and fell off the stage after an encore. A concert-goer said, [...] "He just {{went over to the}} edge of the stage, like he had numerous times through the night, just to wave, and people were throwing stuffed toys and things at him. And he just took one step too many and just disappeared in a flash. He didn't have time to put his arms out to save himself or anything, he just dropped." [...] Coincidentally, one of Australia's leading trauma surgeons was at the concert and close to the stage; Dr. Gordian Fulde treated Buffett at the scene. Fulde said, [...] "I thought he'd broken his neck.... I heard the clunk of his head on a metal ledge, he has a deep gash on his scalp, which is all right now.... But at first I thought: this guy is going to be a spinal injury." [...] Dr Fulde turned him on his side so he could breathe and administered first aid. Buffett regained consciousness within a few minutes. He was then transported to St Vincent's Hospital <b>Emergency</b> <b>centre</b> for treatment and was released the next day. Buffett returned to Australia in 2012 for two shows in Brisbane and Melbourne, and made much fun of the incident during those shows. In the Melbourne show in the historic Palais Theatre in the Melbourne beachside suburb of St. Kilda he presented additional verses of [...] "Margaritaville" [...] in which he made humorous references to the accident, much to the audience's delight.|$|E
