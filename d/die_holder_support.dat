40|$|Brittle {{fracture}} of large forging equipment usually leads to catastrophic consequences. To avoid {{this kind of}} accident, the brittle fracture behaviors of a large <b>die</b> <b>holder</b> were studied by simulating the practical application. The <b>die</b> <b>holder</b> is used on the large die forging press, and it is made of 55 NiCrMoV 7 hot-work tool steel. Detailed investigations including mechanical properties analysis, metallographic observation, fractography, transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis and {{selected area electron diffraction}} (SAED) were conducted. The results reveal that the material generated a large quantity of large size polyhedral M 23 C 6 (M: Fe and Cr mainly) and elongated M 3 C (M: Fe mainly) carbides along the martensitic lath boundaries when the <b>die</b> <b>holder</b> was recurrently tempered and water-cooled at 250 °C during the service. The large size carbides lead to the material embrittlement and impact toughness degradation, and further resulted in the brittle {{fracture of}} the <b>die</b> <b>holder.</b> Therefore, the operation specification must be emphasized to avoid the <b>die</b> <b>holder</b> being cooled by using water, which is aimed at accelerating the cooling...|$|R
40|$|Embodiments of {{the present}} {{invention}} are directed to a simple apparatus and a convenient and accurate method of mounting the components to form an off-axis reflective optical apparatus such as a collimator. In one embodiment, an off-axis reflective optical apparatus comprises a mounting block having a ferrule <b>holder</b> <b>support</b> surface and an off-axis reflector support surface which is generally perpendicular to the ferrule <b>holder</b> <b>support</b> surface. An optical reflector is mounted on the off-axis reflector support surface and has a reflected beam centerline. The optical reflector has a conic reflective surface and a conic center. A ferrule holder is mounted on the ferrule <b>holder</b> <b>support</b> surface. The ferrule holder provides a ferrule for coupling to an optical fiber and orienting a fiber tip of the optical fiber along a fiber axis toward the optical reflector. The fiber axis is nonparallel to the reflected beam centerline. Prior to mounting the optical reflector to the off-axis reflector support surface and prior to mounting the ferrule holder to the ferrule <b>holder</b> <b>support</b> surface, the optical reflector is movable on the off-axis reflector surface and the ferrule holder is movable on the ferrule <b>holder</b> <b>support</b> surface to align the conic center of the optical reflector {{with respect to the}} fiber tip of the optical fiber, and the apparatus has {{at least one of the}} following features: (1) the optical reflector is movable on the off-axis reflector support surface to adjust a focus of the fiber tip with respect to the optical reflector, and (2) the ferrule holder is movable on the ferrule <b>holder</b> <b>support</b> surface to adjust the focus of the fiber tip with respect to the optical reflector...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This review {{presents}} a portable head instrument, using a hybrid laser generation/aircoupled detection system for ultrasonic non-destructive inspection. The equipment {{is made of}} a low-cost Nd:YAG pulsed laser linked to a multimode optic fiber to generate Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW). Instead of a long-pulse detection laser coupled to an interferometer, a small aircoupled ultrasonic transducer is used to perform the detection. A compact probe <b>holder</b> <b>supporting</b> the optical assembly and the air-coupled transducer has been designed, and integrated with an XY scanner system to move the probe above the sample. Inspection tests are carried-out on representative samples, and the performances of the portable head are evaluated for surface and subsurface defect detection in aeronautic composite materials. Introduction: Conventional ultrasonic techniques for Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) of materials manufactured by the aeronautic industry have traditionally relied on systems using contact piezoelectric transducers for both generation and detection. These standard inspection systems, including pulse-echo, through transmission and tandem mode require an immersion medium (usually water), or a coupling agent (gel, mineral oil…) between the sample to b...|$|R

40|$|In this report, {{we focus}} on two {{different}} array-based technologies that enable large-scale screening of protein interactions. First, protein arrays focus on the identification of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Second, DNA arrays have also evolved to explore the identification of protein-DNA interactions (PDIs), offering novel tools to control key biological processes. Such a tool is termed protein-binding DNA arrays (also protein-DNA arrays or protein-binding microarrays). These two array-based technologies share unrivaled screening capabilities and constitute valid approaches to address biological questions {{at the molecular level}} and, eventually, may be used in biomedical applications. Outstanding achievements of these technologies and their eventual application in biomedicine are discussed here, including the identification and characterization of biomarkers, screening of PPIs, detection of protein posttranslational modifications and biofluid profiling. Advantages and limitations of protein arrays, protein-binding arrays, and other proteomic technologies are also discussed here. Finally, we built a list of dedicated databases and on-line resources comprising updated information on human PPIs and PDIs that can serve as a toolbox for researchers in the field. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

30|$|It {{has been}} shown before that liquids can slip at a solid boundary, which {{prompted}} the idea that parallel-surfaces bearings can be achieved just by alternating slip and non-slip regions {{in the direction of}} fluid flow. The amount of slip at the wall depends on the surface tension at the liquid–solid interface, which in turn depends on the chemical state of the surface and its roughness. In the present study a heterogeneous surface was obtained by coating half of a circular glass disc with a coating repellant to glycerol. A rotating glass disc was placed at a known/calibrated distance and the gap was filled with glycerol. With the mobile surface moving from the direction of slip to non-slip region it can be theoretically shown that a pressure build up can be achieved. The pressure gradient in the two regions is constant, similar to that in a Rayleigh step bearing, with the maximum pressure at the separation line. The heterogeneous disc was placed on a <b>holder</b> <b>supported</b> by a load cell thus the force generated by this pressure increase can be measured accurately. Tests were carried out at different sliding speeds and gaps and the load carried was measured and subsequently compared with theoretical calculations. This allowed the slip coefficient to be evaluated.|$|R
