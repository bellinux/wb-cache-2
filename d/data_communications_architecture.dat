This architecture provides a finite security precision of network communication within the defense network like C 4 I System. In this proposed network communication architecture where security is being prioritized, we propose three security mechanism levels, the authentication level, the Business Rules Repository level & Security Rules Repository level and available techniques facilitating the functionality of the levels. Security can be coerced at every stage of the data transit.

In Section I 1 I we provide some theoretical results dealing with the performance of a packet broadcasting network when the users of the network have a variety of data rates. In Section IV we deal with packet broadcasting networks distributed in space, and in Section V we derive some properties of power-limited packet broadcasting channels, showing that the throughput of such channels can approach that of equivalent point-to-point channels...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigation features {{guidelines for}} planning, designing, and integrating a distributed wireless mobile LAN (local area network) and WAN (wide area network) intranet at the School of Computer and Information Sciences (SCIS) at Nova Southeastern University (NSU). This wireless intranet integrates with the SCIS wired intranet and enables ubiquitous wireless computing access from anywhere and at anytime. This paradigm solves {{a problem that}} is currently inherent in the set-up of the SCIS computer system. Currently, users are bound by where {{and when they are}} able to use the cabled system. Access to information and network resources is presently known to be limited. The proposed <b>data</b> <b>communications</b> <b>architecture</b> features a wireless LAN (WLAN) for on-campus coverage and a wireless wide area network (WW AN) for enabling remote access from anywhere in the United States where AT 2 ̆ 6 T Wireless Data Services exist. The wireless LAN is radio-based and the WW AN uses AT 2 ̆ 6 T 2 ̆ 7 s cellular digital packet data (CDPD) technology. The WLAN system is based on Lucent Technologies 2 ̆ 7 WaveLAN equipment that is compliant with the 802. 11 industry standard set by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and is designed to provide graceful scalability. The WW AN network utilizes the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) to provide access to the SCIS intranet and facilitate network connectivity to any other available network (i. e. corporate intranets). Both WLAN and WW AN designs are integrated with the present SCIS wired computer architecture and called Wireless Nova after the university’s original name, Nova University. The process and methodology by which the systems planning, design, and integration take place follow the Modem Systems Development Life Cycle (MSDLC) model published by Whitten et al (1994).

The Nascom IP transition protocol distributes data encapsulated in the legacy Nascom block data structure using an IP infrastructure and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Multicast). Nascom block is a NASA unique fixed length data format which is an artifact of the days when <b>data</b> <b>communications</b> consisted of point-to-point communications interfaces.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{described a}} <b>communications</b> <b>architecture</b> that facilitated higher performance and better responsiveness in wireless environments where data transmission failures can be frequent. This <b>communications</b> <b>architecture</b> enabled efficient and cost -effective incorporation of legacy mainframe data access into today 2 ̆ 7 s wireless data network environments {{without the need}} for costly rewrites of legacy applications code. <b>Data</b> <b>communications</b> over radio frequencies represent the final frontier in computer-based connectivity. Wireless <b>data</b> <b>communications</b> allow users to access enterprise-based information from virtually any location without the constraints imposed by traditional telephone or data network connections. However, legacy applications do not operate efficiently when run over wireless transmissions. Nonetheless, wireless access to enterprise data has become a high priority issue for mobile users within corporations that require 2 ̆ 2 go-anywhere and do-anything 2 ̆ 2 computing. The <b>communications</b> <b>architecture</b> proposed allows mobile users to access legacy mainframe data more efficiently and cost-effectively. The <b>communications</b> <b>architecture</b> described is a layered architecture which eliminated unnecessary legacy mainframe connection-oriented overhead and reduced the amount of data sent to and from the mainframe. It described the layers of the architecture that were responsible for these tasks. The layers in the proposed architecture were designed with built-in intelligence because of the high likelihood of corrupt and incomplete data transmissions in wireless environments. Intelligent analysis {{of the state of the}} communications was performed at all times within each layer. The proposed architecture presented various types of intelligent analysis, actions, and the appropriate layers in which the analysis and actions resided. The proposed <b>communications</b> <b>architecture</b> was based upon a simple OSI-like layered protocol with enhancements designed to reduce unnecessary data flow and maximize compression of data to be transferred. Communications was allowed between non-adjacent layers. This inter-intelligent layer <b>communications</b> <b>architecture</b> supported dynamic tuning of communications to minimize cost and maximize network efficiency. A simulation model was implemented to illustrate a performance analysis comparison between SNA <b>communications</b> <b>architecture</b> and the proposed architecture, both in a wireless environment scenario. It simulated the communications between two machines running concurrently. The implementation of the system was in the C computer language using an IBM compatible personal computer. The dissertation proved and demonstrated that the <b>communications</b> <b>architecture</b> and layered protocol proposed, Wireless Communication (WCOM), significantly reduced the overall user wait time (response time), especially in cases where communication failures were high. It also reduced communication costs (air time). These improvements were accomplished without having to change the legacy mainframe applications, a requirement and key benefit of this architecture...|$|R

30|$|The Sensor Proxy Mobile IPv 6 (SPMIPv 6) {{has been}} {{designed}} for IP-based wireless sensor networks mobility to potentially save energy consumption by relieving the sensor nodes from participating in the handoff process. However, SPMIPv 6 is dependent on a single and central Local Mobility Anchor (LMA), and thus, it inherited {{most of the problems}} observed in the Proxy Mobile IPv 6 (PMIPv 6) protocol, including long handoff latency, non-optimized communication path, and bottleneck issues. In addition, SPMIPv 6 extends the single point of failure to include both the authentication and network information. This study presents an enhanced architecture for SPMIPv 6 called Clustered SPMIPv 6 (CSPMIPv 6) to overcome the problems above. In the proposed architecture, the Mobility Access Gateways (MAGs) are grouped into clusters, each with a distinguished cluster Head MAG (HMAG). The HMAG is mainly designed to reduce the load on LMA by performing intra-cluster handoff signaling and providing an optimized path for <b>data</b> <b>communications.</b> The proposed <b>architecture</b> is evaluated analytically, and the numerical results show that the proposed CSPMIPv 6 outperforms both SPMIPv 6 and PMIPv 6 protocols in terms of LMA load, local handoff delay, and transmission cost performance metrics.|$|R

Advancements in wireless communications networks like Long Term Evolution (LTE) and 5 G networks indicate a trend towards higher speed mobile networks accessed by users with increasingly sophisticated mobile devices. These advancements do not include the means for users to leverage increased wireless network transmission rates by disseminating heterogeneous data. The ability to share heterogeneous data entirely through mobile networks illustrates a communications methodology where end users determine what data will be shared with no limitations based on content. Advances in this domain have introduced many aspects of this methodology on a global scale but have not addressed how heterogeneous data can be defined and distributed by end users.
