5|$|Before World War II, Poland's Jewish {{community}} had numbered between 3,300,000 and 3,500,000 persons– about 10 {{percent of the}} country's total population. During World War II, Germany's Nazi regime sent millions of deportees from every European country to the concentration camps it {{set up in the}} General Government in occupied Poland. Soon after war <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>out,</b> the Germans began their extermination of Polish Jews, ethnic Polish, Romani, Russians, Czech, and others minorities of Poland. Most were quickly rounded up and imprisoned in ghettos, which they were forbidden to leave.|$|E
5|$|By now, the War of the Spanish Succession <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>out,</b> {{and news}} of its {{declaration}} reached Benbow on 7 July. He detached Whetstone and six ships to search off Port St Louis in Hispaniola for a French squadron under Admiral Jean du Casse, which he believed would {{call at the}} port on his voyage to Cartagena, and from there he might raid English and Dutch shipping. After Whetstone had left, Benbow took his squadron and sailed for Cartagena, anticipating that either he or Whetstone would find Du Casse and bring him to battle.|$|E
5|$|By then, {{violence}} <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>out</b> {{between the}} two sides; {{less than three months}} after it had been agreed, John and the loyalist barons firmly repudiated the failed charter: the First Barons' War erupted. The rebel barons concluded that peace with John was impossible, and turned to Philip II's son, the future Louis VIII, for help, offering him the English throne. The war soon settled into a stalemate. The King became ill and died on the night of 18 October, leaving the nine-year-old Henry III as his heir.|$|E

Spezza and Brashear were assessed for the most penalty minutes in the game, receiving 35 and 34, respectively.

5|$|Although Gascoigne {{had always}} {{intended}} to study mathematics at Cambridge, an event occurred that significantly shaped his career. In 1931, an earthquake in New Zealand killed Michael Hiatt Baker, a young traveller from Bristol, {{and his parents}} established a postgraduate scholarship in his memory, for study at the University of Bristol, which Gascoigne won and took up in 1938. During his thesis studies at Bristol, Gascoigne developed a diffraction theory of the Foucault test that is used for evaluating the shape of large telescope mirrors. He completed his doctorate in physics in 1941, but by then war <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>out</b> in Europe, and he had already returned to New Zealand on the last available ship.|$|E
5|$|As {{the combat}} raged {{at the head}} of the line, the {{remainder}} of both squadrons strained to join the battle. The British eastern division under Louis reached the battling Alexandre and Spencer at 10:35, the two ships locked together to the south of the main engagement. As they passed, Canopus, Donegal and Atlas all raked the French ship, bringing down all of her masts and leaving her in a crippled state. Canopus then steered directly towards the battle around Impérial, as Donegal and Atlas turned northwest to intercept Brave and Jupiter respectively. At 11:00, Spencer followed Canopus while Alexandres crew were preoccupied with extinguishing a fire that <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>out</b> on board. Alexandre was so badly damaged that she was unable to either escape or continue the action; she formally surrendered ten minutes later.|$|E
5|$|Concorde {{was bought}} into the navy and {{commissioned}} in the West Indies {{for a return to}} Britain later in the year, though her commander for this voyage is unknown. She arrived in Britain and was paid off in September at Chatham. With the end of the American War of Independence and the draw-down in the navy, Concorde was not brought into immediate service but remained laid up at Chatham until November 1790, when a great repair was begun by Wilson, of Frindsbury. The work, which cost a total of £18,259, was completed by April 1793, by which time the French Revolutionary Wars <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>out.</b> She was fitted for service at Chatham between April and May 1793, at a cost of £6,600, and was commissioned in April under Captain Thomas Wells.|$|E

5|$|Discovering on 24 December {{that the}} French squadrons <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>out</b> of Brest, Barham {{despatched}} two squadrons in pursuit, led by Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Strachan and Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren. A third squadron {{detached from the}} blockade of Cadiz without orders, under its commander Rear-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth, all three British forces cruising the mid-Atlantic {{in search of the}} French. Following a brief encounter with Willaumez, Duckworth sailed to the Caribbean and there discovered and destroyed Leissegues' squadron at the Battle of San Domingo in February 1806. With one of the French squadrons eliminated, Strachan and Warren remained in the mid-Atlantic anticipating Willaumez's return from his operations to the south. Warren's squadron was ordered to cruise in the Eastern Atlantic, in the region of the island of Madeira, directly across Linois's line of advance.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} ships' careers, {{they were}} {{assigned}} to the main Italian fleet, where they were frequently occupied with conducting training exercises. These exercises frequently gamed attacks by the French fleet, such as the maneuvers conducted in 1893, which simulated a French attack on Naples. In 1895, Partenope joined a squadron that visited Great Britain, and later that year took part in an international naval demonstration off Crete in an attempt to defuse tensions between Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Euridice took part in a similar demonstration, again off Crete, in 1897; this was a reaction to the Greco-Turkish War that <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>out</b> that year. Between 1906 and 1908, Partenope was converted into a minelayer, and Minerva underwent a similar conversion in 19091910. Two ships, Calatafimi and Euridice, were discarded in early 1907.|$|E

Clouzot also studied the fragile nature {{of the other people}} in the sanatorium. Clouzot had little money during this period, and was provided with financial and moral support by his family and friends. By the time Clouzot left the sanatorium and returned to Paris, World War II <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>out.</b> French cinema had changed because many of the producers he had known had fled France to escape Nazism.|$|E

Stephen formed an army to besiege Bedford Castle but Miles gained advance warning of the attack and took in considerable supplies, preparing for a long siege. Stephen was unable to storm the castle and left a force under the command of Hugh to starve it into submission whilst he marched north to tackle the Scots invasion.|$|E
