40|$|The {{feedstock}} {{characteristics of}} the conversion platform will influence the optimal harvest and post harvest management practices for switchgrass. However, many of the harvest management practices are tied to plant phenology and will be similar across platforms. Proper harvest and storage of switchgrass will help provide a consistent and high-quality feedstock to the biorefinery. Bioenergyspecific switchgrass strains are high-yielding {{and in most cases}} can be harvested and baled with commercially available <b>haying</b> <b>equipment.</b> Many options are available for packaging switchgrass for storage and transportation, but large round bales or large rectangular bales are the most readily available and are in use on farms. Large round bales tend to have less storage losses than large rectangular bales when stored outside, but rectangular bales tend to be easier to handle and load a truck for transport without road width restrictions. Although there is limited large-scale experience with harvesting and storing switchgrass for bioenergy, extensive research, as well as a history of harvesting hay crops for livestock in many agroecoregions, makes harvesting and preserving switchgrass for bioenergy feasible at the landscape scale...|$|E
40|$|Rotary disc mowers {{are capable}} of much higher {{throughput}} than traditional mowers, {{and as a result}} have much higher power demands. With the recent increasing popularity of rotary mowers and the ever-increasing size of high-capacity forage and <b>haying</b> <b>equipment,</b> manufacturers are offering larger mowers with higher power demands. A disc mower cutterbar requires a significant amount of the total implement power, and little research has been performed relating to the study of power requirements and material movement. The objectives of this research were to develop a means of measuring cutterbar power requirements and material flow, and to perform a statistical design of the mower in operation. Using these results, {{it may be possible to}} offer insight into changes that could be considered in the design of rotary mower cutterbars. Two types of experiments were performed on a prototype disc mower. Both experiments were performed in both alfalfa and light grass, at three different ground speeds, and at three different disc rotational velocities. The first experiment consisted of measuring the power requirements and specific energy of three individual discs on the prototype cutterbar. The rotational direction of the three adjacent discs investigated produce converging and diverging cutting zones. Measurements were made by means of instrumented drive hubs, each with individual onboard data acquisition systems. Average power measurements recorded by each instrumented hub were found to be approximately 2. 45 and 3. 31 kW for alfalfa and grass, respectively. Likewise, average specific energy measurements for alfalfa and grass ranged from 1. 83 to 5. 74 kW•h/t, respectively. The second experiment involved the optical flow field calculation from high-speed videos captured of the cutterbar in operation. A phase-based optical flow algorithm was applied to videos captured to study material flow across the cutterbar. An analytical model and two regression models were developed to describe and predict the cutterbar specific energy at the converging and diverging zones. The analytical model was based on the cutting and transport processes as performed by the rotating discs, as well as the zero-load power. The model included the results of the averaged material flow vector angles. The regression models were fitted to the experimental specific energy results as a function of the different combinations of effects in the experimental design. All three models, which were produced for both the converging and diverging cutting zones, were found with coefficient of determination values between 0. 79 and 0. 96...|$|E

50|$|Crystal Spring Farm {{is located}} in a rural area of southwestern Brunswick, its {{building}} complex set southeast of the junction of Pleasant Hill and Woodside Roads. The associated farmland consists of two large parcels south of Pleasant Hill Road and on either side of Woodside. The land is predominantly open fields, with some woodlots. The farm complex includes ten buildings, organized roughly in a U shape, with the main house at the eastern end. The house is a 19th-century agglomeration of several residential structures that have been stitched together. To its northwest stands an early 20th-century slaughterhouse. The remaining buildings all date to a building program prompted by a fire in 1946 that destroyed the rest of the original complex.

50|$|As is {{the case}} with most jockeys, Don Howard {{experienced}} several serious injuries. In 1993, he suffered a nearly fatal accident while racing at Louisiana Downs. In the final stretch riding Police Cat, the horse broke its leg resulting in the horse falling into a somersault. Don was able to untangle himself from his horse only to be trampled by an apprentice's horse that was several lengths behind. Don was unconscious for nearly an hour and initially was not expected to survive. He suffered his fourth severe concussion in six months and had a compound fracture of his right humerus, the same arm that was nearly amputed when he was 14 due to a <b>hay</b> <b>equipment</b> accident. In 1994, Don Howard attempted to return to horse racing, only to discover that the fractured humerus had not healed. The non-union fracture required several additional surgeries.|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that preprocessing procedure {{can reduce the}} transportation and storage costs of biomass feedstock for biofuel production by condensing the feedstock’s size. However, the capital costs of preprocessing facilities could be significant in the feedstock logistics system.

40|$|Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida on the {{conservation}} of forages as round bale silage. Grasses and legumes have been harvested using conventional <b>hay</b> making <b>equipment</b> and ensiled as large, round bales of high moisture forage sealed in plastic. When compared to hay, round bale silage offers an alternative forage conservation system that decreases {{the amount of time}} spent drying the forage prior to storage. The benefits of this system include reduced rain damage and field losses, and increased flexibility in scheduling harvesting (allowing producers to harvest for optimum forage quality and yield). When compared with chopped silage, the benefits of round bale silage include excellent dry matter recovery, decreased energy costs and lowered initial capital investment. Main disadvantages are increased capital investment and costs for expendable supplies (when the system is compared to hay), and the susceptibility of plastic used to store round bale silage to rodent damage and deterioration under intense sunlight. Field wilting (to increase dry matter at time of storage to 40 to 50 %) improves the quality of round bale silage made under Florida conditions. Three to four hours usually is required to accomplish this degree of wilt with bermudagrass. Adding ammonia to round bale silage prevents external molding but may result in undesirable fermentation characteristics, especially when high moisture, tropical forages are ensiled. Microbial inoculation (to promote lactic acid production) temporarily improves the quality of direct-cut, high moisture (< 30 % dry matter) round bale silage made with bermudagrass, but pH of inoculated silage generally is not lowered enough to stabilize such silage in a high-quality state. The combination of cellulase-enzyme treatment and inoculation, however, has shown potential to improve the quality of bermudagrass round bale silage...|$|R
40|$|The {{educational}} program of agricultural extension {{was conducted in}} Cherry County during 1940 by the Cherry County Extension Service. 329 families and business firms subscribed 1529. 15 for support of the work. The county commissioners provided office quarters {{at a cost of}} 258. 00 for the year. Other income provided 80. 00 additional funds making a total operating fund of 1867. 15. Expenditures for the year were 255. 00 for office quarters, heat and light, 89. 60 finance committee expense, and 1824. 14 for conducting the general program. The program of work directed special emphasis to F-F-L, Beef Cattle, 4 -H and Project club work. Test plats of sorghum varieties showed Leoti as superior to other varieties with a green weight yield of 9. 5 tons. This compares with 8 tons for black amber, 7. 2 tons for early sumac with other varieties scaling considerably lower. Grain sorghums were again unsuccessful because of early freezing weather. Results obtained by the Valentine Experiment station do not show enough superiority of hybrid corn over local varieties to justify the added expense. One good stand of Hardistan alfalfa has survived dry weather and is a profitable seed crop. Experimental seedings of strawberry clover in alkali spots; red top, timothy, red and alsike clovers, reed canary grass in wet meadows; and crested wheat grass for dry abandoned cropland areas are being conducted. Greater success with the vegetable garden has been reported by 150 farm and ranch homes due to this year 2 ̆ 7 s Extension program. Timely help for all gardeners in the county has been given. Yard beautification improvements were made in not less than 400 yards at the homes of Cherry County ranchers, farmers, and townspeople, {{as a result of the}} attention given to this phase of the Extension program during 1940. Records were made of some of these improvements. 89 homes followed recommendations for planting shrubs and trees. 98 homes planted new lawns or improved existing lawns according to recommendations made. 69 homes corrected walks, drives, and fences to improve the appearance of their home yards. 80 new yard fences were constructed. 50 yard fences were changed. 88 unsightly views were screened with hedges or constructed screens. 286 homes reported a general clean-up on their yards. These records were obtained as a part of the yard beautification demonstration for project clubs. In addition it is known that many other improvements were made of which no records were taken. 52 cooperators planted 23, 700 Clarke-McNary seedlings to form windbreaks. 113 farmers planted trees as a part of their compliance with the Agricultural Conservation cropland program on 335 acres of windbreak. 81 homemakers reported planting trees for erosion control as a part of the home demonstration program for women 2 ̆ 7 s project clubs. 75 homes in the town of Valentine cooperated with a plan developed by the Junior Chamber of Commerce to stimulate interest in tree planting. There is some duplication in these reports obtained through the above mentioned sources. It is conservatively estimated that 265 different plantings of trees were made during 1940. This number compares with 140 for 1939 when estimated on the same basis. 108 homes were repaired. Major repairs were made in 8 homes; 1 water system was installed; 2 light plants placed; 2 poultry houses constructed; 1 complete new barn constructed; built-in kitchen cabinets were installed in 2 homes; 1 house was remodeled; copies were made of a feature of 40 <b>hay</b> <b>equipment</b> machines; 21 chicken feeders and mail boxes were completed as 4 -H projects. 4 meadows were drained; 1 meadow and 5 garden irrigation systems were installed. These reports of accomplishments are listed as those definitely assisted by the Extension program during 1940. Help with poultry rations was extended to 68 turkey growers and a few chicken growers. Regular monthly turkey bulletins prepared at the state office in Lincoln were forwarded by this office to the turkey growers in the county. 38 farm security clients were given assistance to increase production and improve the quality of milk and cream. The county fair, a spring and fall show sponsored by the Northwest Hereford Breeders 2 ̆ 7 Association, a district calf show at Mullen serving the south part of Cherry County, were exhibits for competitive quality improvement. These were the methods employed to bring to the attention of ranchers in the county the possibilities for beef cattle herd improvement. Nearly every rancher in the county was given information concerning control of Bang 2 ̆ 7 s Disease, hemorrhagic, and such specific troubles as calf diptheria, foul foot, retention of urine, grass tetany, white scours, and blackleg. Office interviews, discussion meetings, and circular mailings were the methods used. Assistance to the Sandhills Feeder Cattle Producers 2 ̆ 7 Association and other livestock organizations in the county was given both by the state office and the county Extension office. With over 42, 000 head of feeder cattle, and the offerings of purebred breeders, it is estimated that the total value of livestock sold by individuals participating in these organizations is in excess of 3, 500, 000. 00 for 1940. Rations and feeding practices came under discussion in office interviews, at meetings, and at farm and ranch visits. Soybean cake vs. cottonseed cake as a source of protein was given particular attention. Our recommendations were that soybean cake should be fed in preference to cottonseed cake when the latter is 4. 00 or more per ton higher in price than the former. When soybean cake is fed, phosphorus mineral should be offered ad lib. Sheep feed requirements for wintering, care of the ewe at lambing time, stomach worm control, and wool marketing information was given to 90 sheep growers in the county. 77 farmers and ranchers cooperated in the 1940 Pasture-Forage-Livestock program. Each contributed an outline of his methods. This program was conducted as a research or study of management methods as found on the ranches when visited. 243 weekly news stories concerning the Extension program in Cherry County were submitted to all or a part of 5 newspapers published in the county, and 6 published at stations outside the county borders. 55 circular letters announcing events or discussing subject matter were mailed. 1926 personal letters were written from the county office. 409 ladies enrolled in 31 project clubs for the year 1939 - 1940. Training centers for leaders were conducted at Valentine, Merriman, Gordon, Hyannis, Mullen, and Thedford. 15 clubs were represented at the Valentine Center, 7 at Merriman, 4 at Gordon, 3 at Hyannis, and 3 at Mullen. At Thedford, members from Cherry County enrolled in Thomas County clubs. The demonstrations given this year were Read for Facts and Sing for Fun, Company Dinners, Merry Christmas for the Home, Table Service, Care and Repair of Walls and Floors, and The Livable Home. 21 4 -H clubs were organized. 104 boys and 70 girls enrolled for 196 projects. In addition 29 associate members enrolled for as many projects. Of these associate members enrolled 13 were boys and 16 were girls. 62 boys and 39 girls finished their projects as achievement members. In addition 13 associate members earned achievement certificates. The county Extension office was given charge of the 4 -H, handicraft, floral, project club, foods and needlework divisions of the exhibit section of the county fair. Assistance was given by the Extension leaders in the crops and poultry divisions and in a general livestock exhibit. 22 communities participated in programs of entertainment, recreation, and discussion of timely economic topics. A series of 16 such community gatherings in 14 communities was conducted during the fall. The title 2 ̆ 2 Community Roundups 2 ̆ 2 was coined to designate a type of these special community events. A total attendance of 3700 was recorded for the events both spring and fall. In addition 4 project club achievement days with an attendance of 727; 2 rural youth meetings with an attendance of 300, and 1 recreation meeting sponsored by the Kennedy community with an attendance of over 100, were conducted. The question of 2 ̆ 2 Shall an appropriation be made annually from the general fund of the county for the support of Agricultural Extension work? 2 ̆ 2 received approval at the November 5 election. The final canvass of ballots totaled 2399 for and 1655 against. This method of financing will be much simpler than the method followed heretofore of soliciting for volunteer subscriptions. It will remove much of the difficulties which have confronted the directors and called for a great deal of their attention. This change will also eliminate the need for constant attention to finances by the office personnel...|$|R
