5|$|A Titan's {{durability}} <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> size; larger Titans {{will take}} more effort to defeat than others and a few are immune to Crash's attacks. To defeat them, Crash has to jack a smaller Titan to fight them. On defeating the larger Titan, he can dismount the Titan he previously jacked and directly jack the larger Titan. The dismounted Titan will then be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Diamond {{hardness}} <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> purity, crystalline perfection and orientation: hardness {{is higher}} for flawless, pure crystals oriented to the <111> direction (along the longest diagonal of the cubic diamond lattice).

5|$|The known {{expansion}} {{rate of the}} Homunculus Nebula provides an unusual geometric method for measuring its distance. Assuming that the two lobes of the nebula are symmetrical, the projection of the nebula onto the sky <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> distance. Values of 2,300, 2,250 and 2,300parsecs have been derived for the Homunculus, and Eta Carinae is clearly at the same distance.|$|E
5|$|X-rays show lucency of the {{ossification}} {{front in}} juveniles.

Harding described the lateral X-ray as a method to identify the site of an OCD lesion.|$|E

5|$|Design {{management}} {{is not a}} standard model that can be projected onto every enterprise, nor is there a specific way of applying it that leads to guaranteed success. Design management processes are carried out by humans with different responsibilities and backgrounds, who work in different industries and enterprises with different sizes and traditions, whilst having different target groups and markets to serve. Design {{management is}} multifaceted, {{and so are the}} different applications of and views on design management. The function of design management in an organisation <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> tasks, authority, and practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleolus}} is {{a discrete}} densely stained structure {{found in the}} nucleus. It is not surrounded by a membrane, and is sometimes called a suborganelle. It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions (NOR). The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes. The structural cohesion of the nucleolus <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association. This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} any {{pathogen}} <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> ability to elude host immune responses. Therefore, pathogens evolved several methods {{that allow them}} to successfully infect a host, while evading detection or destruction by the immune system. Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier, for example, by using a type II secretion system. Alternatively, using a type III secretion system, they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell, providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host. These proteins are often used to shut down host defenses.|$|E

5|$|With {{the average}} {{concentration}} of about 8 {{parts per million}} (ppm), samarium is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth's crust. It is the fifth most abundant lanthanide and is more common than elements such as tin. Samarium concentration in soils varies between 2 and 23ppm, and oceans contain about 0.5–0.8parts per trillion. Distribution of samarium in soils strongly <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> chemical state and is very inhomogeneous: in sandy soils, samarium concentration is about 200 times higher at the surface of soil particles than in the water trapped between them, and this ratio can exceed 1,000 in clays.|$|E
5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E

5|$|The {{geometry}} of a back country ski <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> purpose—skis suited for forested areas where loose powder can predominate may be shorter and wider than those selected for open, exposed areas where compacted snow may prevail. Sidecut on Telemark skis promotes turning in forest and rugged terrain. Width and short length aid turning in loose and deep snow. Longer, narrower and more rigid skis with sharp edges are suited for snow {{that has been}} compacted by wind or freeze-thaw. Touring ski design may represent a general-purpose compromise among these different ski conditions, plus being acceptable for use in groomed tracks. Traction may come from a textured or waxed grip zone, as with classic skis, or from ski skins, which are applied to the ski bottom for long, steep ascents and have hairs or mechanical texture that prevents sliding backwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of bold skin markings {{does not in}} itself prove that an animal relies on camouflage, as that <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> behaviour. For example, although giraffes have a high contrast pattern that could be disruptive coloration, the adults are extremely conspicuous when in the open. Some authors have argued that adult giraffes are cryptic, since when standing among trees and bushes they are hard to see at even a few metres' distance. However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves, even from lions, rather than on camouflage. A different explanation is implied {{by the fact that}} young giraffes are far more vulnerable to predation than adults: {{more than half of all}} giraffe calves die within a year, and giraffe mothers hide their calves, which spend much of the time lying down in cover while their mothers are away feeding. Since the {{presence of}} a mother nearby does not affect survival, it is argued that young giraffes must be extremely well camouflaged; this is supported by the fact that coat markings are strongly inherited.|$|E
