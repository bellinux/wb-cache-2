Coaxial stacking is the tendency of nucleic acid blunt ends to bind to each other, by interactions between the exposed bases. There are three possible stacking conformers: an unstacked form and two stacked forms. The unstacked form dominates in the absence of divalent cations such as Mg2+, because of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>repulsion</b> between the negatively charged backbones of the strands. In the presence of at least about 0.1 mM Mg2+, the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>repulsion</b> is counteracted and the stacked structures predominate.

40|$|International audienceThe {{stabilization}} of o/w Pickering emulsions {{in cases of}} weak adsorption of solid particles at the surface of oil droplets is addressed. Though the adsorption is usually very strong and irreversible when partial wetting conditions are fulfilled, <b>electrostatic</b> <b>repulsions</b> between charged solid particles act against the adsorption. The regime of weak adsorption was reached using charged silica nanoparticles at high pH and low ionic strength. O/w Pickering emulsions of the diisopropyl adipate oil were stabilized by colloidal nanoparticles of Ludox® AS 40 consisting of non-aggregated particles of bare silica (hydrophilic). The combination of stability assessment, droplet size and electrokinetic potential measurements at various pH values, adsorption isotherms and cryo-SEM observations of the adsorbed layers disclosed the specificities of the {{stabilization of}} Pickering emulsions by adsorption of solid nanoparticles against strong <b>electrostatic</b> <b>repulsions.</b> Not only the long-term stability of emulsions was poor under strong <b>electrostatic</b> <b>repulsions</b> at high pH, but emulsification failed since full dispersion of oil could not be achieved. Emulsion stability was ensured by decreasing <b>electrostatic</b> <b>repulsions</b> by lowering the pH from 9 to 3.

25|$|The {{variation}} in specific binding energy with atomic number {{is due to}} the interplay of the two fundamental forces acting on the component nucleons (protons and neutrons) that make up the nucleus. Nuclei are bound by an attractive nuclear force between nucleons, which overcomes the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>repulsion</b> between protons. However, the nuclear force acts only over relatively short ranges (a few nucleon diameters), since it follows an exponentially decaying Yukawa potential which makes it insignificant at longer distances. The <b>electrostatic</b> <b>repulsion</b> is of longer range, since it decays by an inverse-square rule, so that nuclei larger than about 12nucleons in diameter reach a point that the total <b>electrostatic</b> <b>repulsion</b> overcomes the nuclear force and causes them to be spontaneously unstable. For the same reason, larger nuclei (more than about eight nucleons in diameter) are less tightly bound per unit mass than are smaller nuclei; breaking a large nucleus into two or more intermediate-sized nuclei releases energy. The origin of this energy is the nuclear force, which intermediate-sized nuclei allows to act more efficiently, because each nucleon has more neighbors which are within the short range attraction of this force. Thus less energy is needed in the smaller nuclei and the difference to the state before is set free.|$|E
25|$|The {{electrostatic}} force, on {{the other}} hand, is an inverse-square force, so a proton added to a nucleus will feel an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>repulsion</b> {{from all the other}} protons in the nucleus.

25|$|The {{decrease}} in stability {{is due to}} the fact that sharing edges and faces places cations in closer proximity to each other, so that cation-cation <b>electrostatic</b> <b>repulsion</b> is increased.

The spokes appear dark in backscattered light, and bright in forward-scattered light (see images in Gallery); the transition occurs at a phase angle near 60°. The leading theory regarding the spokes' composition is that they consist of microscopic dust particles suspended away from the main ring by <b>electrostatic</b> <b>repulsion,</b> as they rotate almost synchronously with the magnetosphere of Saturn.

25|$|Electrospinning is {{a highly}} {{versatile}} technique {{that can be used}} to produce continuous fibers from submicrometer to nanometer diameters. In a typical electrospinning set-up, a solution is fed through a spinneret and a high voltage is applied to the tip.

A mounted collector plate or rod with an opposite or grounded charge draws in the continuous fibers, which arrive to form a highly porous network. The primary advantages of this technique are its simplicity and ease of variation. At a laboratory level, a typical electrospinning set-up only requires a high voltage power supply (up to 30 kV), a syringe, a flat tip needle and a conducting collector. For these reasons, electrospinning has become a common method of scaffold manufacture in many labs.

40|$|International audienceThe {{adenylate cyclase}} toxin (CyaA) {{is one of}} the major {{virulence}} factors of Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough. Its C-terminal region, the receptor-binding domain (RD), contains ∼ 40 calcium-binding Repeat in ToXin (RTX) motifs, which are characteristic of many virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria. We previously showed that RD is intrinsically disordered in the absence of calcium and acquires its functional three-dimensional structure upon calcium binding. To gain further insight into the physicochemical properties of RD, we characterized its calcium-induced conformational and stability changes by combining spectroscopic approaches. We show that RD, in the absence of calcium, adopts premolten globule conformations, due in part to the strong internal <b>electrostatic</b> <b>repulsions</b> between the negative charges of the aspartate-rich polypeptide sequence. Accordingly, sodium is able to screen these <b>electrostatic</b> <b>repulsions,</b> allowing a partial compaction of the polypeptide, whereas calcium triggers a strong compaction as well as the acquisition of secondary and tertiary structures in a highly cooperative manner. The differential sensitivity of the calcium-loaded state to guanidinium- and urea-induced denaturations provides further evidence that electrostatic interactions play a critical role in the folding and stability of RD.

25|$|A decade later, Davson and Danielli {{proposed}} a modification to this concept. In their model, the lipid bilayer was coated {{on either side}} {{with a layer of}} globular proteins. According to their view, this protein coat had no particular structure and was simply formed by adsorption from solution. Their theory was also incorrect in that it ascribed the barrier properties of the membrane to <b>electrostatic</b> <b>repulsion</b> from the protein layer rather than the energetic cost of crossing the hydrophobic core. A more direct investigation of the membrane was made possible through the use of electron microscopy in the late 1950s. After staining with heavy metal labels, Sjöstrand et al. noted two thin dark bands separated by a light region, which they incorrectly interpreted as a single molecular layer of protein. A more accurate interpretation was made by J. David Robertson, who determined that the dark electron-dense bands were the headgroups and associated proteins of two apposed lipid monolayers. In this body of work, Robertson put forward the concept of the “unit membrane.” This {{was the first time the}} bilayer structure had been universally assigned to all cell membranes as well as organelle membranes.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{mechanisms}} {{behind this}} complex {{sequence of events}} are still a matter of debate. To simplify the system and allow more definitive study, many experiments have been performed in vitro with synthetic lipid vesicles. These {{studies have shown that}} divalent cations {{play a critical role in}} the fusion process by binding to negatively charged lipids such as phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. One role on these ions in the fusion process is to shield the negative charge on the surface of the bilayer, diminishing <b>electrostatic</b> <b>repulsion</b> and allowing the membranes to approach each other. This is clearly not the only role, however, since there is an extensively documented difference in the ability of Mg2+ versus Ca2+ to induce fusion. Although Mg2+ will induce extensive aggregation it will not induce fusion, while Ca2+ induces both. It has been proposed that this discrepancy is due to a difference in extent of dehydration. Under this theory, calcium ions bind more strongly to charged lipids, but less strongly to water. The resulting displacement of calcium for water destabilizes the lipid-water interface and promotes intimate interbilayer contact. A recently proposed alternative hypothesis is that the binding of calcium induces a destabilizing lateral tension. Whatever the mechanism of calcium-induced fusion, the initial interaction is clearly electrostatic, since zwitterionic lipids are not susceptible to this effect.|$|E
25|$|Overton (a {{distant cousin}} of Charles Darwin) first {{proposed}} {{the concept of}} a lipid (oil) plasma membrane in 1899. The major weakness of the lipid membrane was the lack of an explanation of the high permeability to water, so Nathansohn (1904) proposed the mosaic theory. In this view, the membrane is not a pure lipid layer, but a mosaic of areas with lipid and areas with semipermeable gel. Ruhland refined the mosaic theory to include pores to allow additional passage of small molecules. Since membranes are generally less permeable to anions, Leonor Michaelis concluded that ions are adsorbed to the walls of the pores, changing the permeability of the pores to ions by <b>electrostatic</b> <b>repulsion.</b> Michaelis demonstrated the membrane potential (1926) and proposed that it was related to the distribution of ions across the membrane. Harvey and Danielli (1939) proposed a lipid bilayer membrane covered on each side with a layer of protein to account for measurements of surface tension. In 1941 Boyle & Conway showed that the membrane of resting frog muscle was permeable to both K+ and Cl-, but apparently not to Na+, so the idea of electrical charges in the pores was unnecessary since a single critical pore size would explain the permeability to K+ , H+, and Cl- as well as the impermeability to Na+, Ca+, and Mg++.|$|E
