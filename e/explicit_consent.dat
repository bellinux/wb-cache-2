5|$|The incessant warfare of the 1290s put a great {{financial}} {{demand on}} Edward's subjects. Whereas the King had only levied three lay subsidies until 1294, four such taxes were granted {{in the years}} 1294–97, raising over £200,000. Along with this came the burden of prises (appropriation of food), seizure of wool and hides, and the unpopular additional duty on wool, dubbed the maltolt. The fiscal demands on the King's subjects caused resentment, and this resentment eventually led to serious political opposition. The initial resistance was not caused by the lay taxes, however, but by clerical subsidies. In 1294, Edward made a demand of a grant of one half of all clerical revenues. There was some resistance, but the King responded by threatening with outlawry, and the grant was eventually made. At the time, the archbishopric of Canterbury was vacant, since Robert Winchelsey was in Italy to receive consecration. Winchelsey returned in January 1295 and had to consent to another grant in November of that year. In 1296, however, his position changed when he received the papal bull Clericis laicos. This bull prohibited the clergy from paying taxes to lay authorities without <b>explicit</b> <b>consent</b> from the Pope. When the clergy, {{with reference to the}} bull, refused to pay, Edward responded with outlawry. Winchelsey was presented with a dilemma between loyalty to the King and upholding the papal bull, and he responded by leaving it to every individual clergyman to pay as he saw fit. By the end of the year, a solution was offered by the new papal bull Etsi de statu, which allowed clerical taxation in cases of pressing urgency.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two ways}} to give consent: <b>explicit</b> <b>consent</b> or implied consent. <b>Explicit</b> <b>consent</b> is when a patient clearly {{communicates}} to a healthcare worker, verbally or in writing or in some other way, that relevant confidential information can be shared. Implied consent, means that a patient's consent to share personal confidential information is assumed. When personal confidential information is shared between healthcare workers, consent is taken as implied.|$|E
25|$|The term consent is {{typically}} {{defined as a}} subject adhering to an agreement of principals and regulations; however, the definition becomes difficult to execute concerning the topic of organ donation, mainly because the subject is incapable of consent due to death or mental impairment. There {{are two types of}} consent being reviewed; <b>explicit</b> <b>consent</b> and presumed consent. <b>Explicit</b> <b>consent</b> consists of the donor giving direct consent through proper registration depending on the country. The second consent process is presumed consent, which does not need direct consent from the donor or the next of kin. Presumed consent assumes that donation would have been permitted by the potential donor if permission was pursued. Of possible donors an estimated twenty-five percent of families refuse to donate a loved one's organs. Consent is defined as adhering to an agreement of principals. However, this definition is hard to enforce in accordance with organ donation because, in most cases, organs are donated from the deceased, and can no longer provide consent for themselves.|$|E

25|$|The {{method of}} {{recruiting}} participants was also initially controversial. Participants were sent letters of invitation based on names, addresses, and dates of birth {{provided by the}} NHS to the UK Biobank organisers.

25|$|In May 2001, Vitter {{authored}} {{an amendment}} to the No Child Left Behind Act, a reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which required all secondary schools receiving federal funding to permit US military recruitment on school grounds and to provide the name, home phone number and address of every student enrolled to military recruiters, unless the student or the student's parent specifically opts out. In February 2007, Democratic Representative Michael M. Honda proposed the Student Privacy Protection Act of 2007 to change Vitter's amendment from requiring high schools to provide military recruiters with students' personal information unless they explicitly opt-out to requiring the student's <b>explicit</b> <b>consent</b> first. According to the Congressional Quarterly, Vitter stands behind the current provision. He stated that if it is changed, families who supported military recruiting may miss out if required to opt in.|$|E
25|$|Though Knoop {{of course}} {{had been only}} four {{at the time of}} the battle, so he had no {{personal}} knowledge, he could avail himself of the recollections of many Dutch veterans who had been there, and as a general-staff member he had access to the after-battle reports the Dutch units had made within two days after the battle ended. (These archived reports could have been made available to Siborne, and in one case he appears to have been in actual possession of one, but he never bothered to consult them). As a trained historian, Knoop now started to research these sources and wrote a detailed repudiation of Siborne's book based on all these sources. This book (published with the <b>explicit</b> <b>consent</b> of King William II as a semi-official rebuttal), was received with much enthusiasm in Dutch military circles. When soon thereafter there was a false rumor in the Dutch press that captain Siborne was on his way to demand satisfaction, no less than six officers of horse-artillery spontaneoulsy offered to act as Knoop's seconds, if necessary. But Siborne stayed safely in England.|$|E

40|$|The Rotterdam Convention {{that was}} signed in Rotterdam on 10 September 1998 and entered into force on 24 February 2004 regroups {{currently}} 154 Parties. It introduced the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in International trade. The convention aims to promote shared responsibility and cooperative effort among Parties {{in order to protect}} {{human health and the environment}} from potential harm and to contribute to their environmentally sound use, by facilitating information exchange about their characteristics, by providing for a national decision-making process on their import and export and by disseminating these decisions to Parties. The European Union adopted the Rotterdam Convention by Council Decision 2006 / 730 /EC of 25 September 2006. Furthermore, Regulation (EC) No 689 / 2008 of the European Parliament and the Council of 17 June 2008 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals is the latest in a series of measures over the years that seek to address international trade with dangerous chemicals. This Regulation reaffirms the EU commitment towards ensuring proper control in the trade and use of dangerous chemicals at the global level, based on the principle that it should help to protect human health and the environment beyond its borders as well as within. Two linked processes were identified as characterising the PIC content management activities. They are analysed separately: the export notifications process and the <b>explicit</b> <b>consents</b> process. The export notifications process aims to identify uniquely the single administrative document clearing customs. The <b>explicit</b> <b>consents</b> process aims to explicitly exchange risk management information, between an exporting designated national authority and an importing one, prior to export of chemicals. Each process is first described. The functionalities supporting the process are listed and explained. The specific implication of the administrator in the process is then identified. Finally the liaison between both processes is analysed. Several working documents are annexed in order to transparently manage the hand over of the PIC content management activities to the European Chemicals Agency - ECHA. JRC.

25|$|Under Emperor Guangwu, Du Shi was {{appointed}} {{as an officer}} in the Censorate and was in charge of monitoring affairs and upholding law and order within the new capital at Luoyang. When the undisciplined troops of the military officer Xiao Guang (d. 26) ran rampant in the capital city and terrorized its inhabitants without any perceivable action on Xiao's part to prevent it, Du Shi had him arrested. Du had Xiao summarily executed without <b>explicit</b> <b>consent</b> from the throne, sending in a report of the event only after the execution. Guangwu was not displeased with this, as he called him into court to grant him an insignia which justified his actions. Shortly after this event, the bandit leader Yang Yi (d. 26) caused a major disturbance in Hedong Commandery, which Du Shi was sent to quell. When word of the arrival of Du Shi's forces in the region, Yang Yi planned to flee across the Yellow River. However, Du Shi anticipated this, sending a raiding party to burn the boats Yang Yi intended to use for his escape. After conscripting troops from Hedong Commandery, Du Shi led a surprise ambush with a cavalry unit that dispersed Yang's bandits and annihilated them.|$|E

Two days later, the JNA garrison in Vukovar increased its combat readiness to the maximum level. In early spring, the Croats and Serbs reached an agreement whereby Croatian police would not enter Borovo Selo without <b>explicit</b> <b>consent</b> from local Serb authorities. A political rally was held in Borovo Selo on 14 April, {{and by the end of}} the month the situation had become more volatile. Speakers at the rally—Serbian Radical Party (Srpska radikalna stranka – SRS) leader Vojislav Šešelj, Serbian National Assembly member Milan Paroški and Serbian Minister of Diaspora Stanko Cvijan—promoted the creation of Greater Serbia, a state which would unite all Serbs within a single country. They all repeated their speeches, together with an open call for dissenting Croats to be killed, a week later in Jagodnjak, north of Osijek.|$|E

500|$|For a long time, R v Clarence {{was taken}} as an {{authority}} {{on the meaning of}} [...] "inflict", which the court took to mean [...] "an assault or battery of which a wound or grievous bodily harm is the manifest immediate and obvious result". This narrow definition was extended in R v Martin and R v Halliday to include, for example, injuries sustained during an attempt of the victim to flee. An injury is said to be [...] "inflicted" [...] if it is the result of an impact or percussion set in motion by the defendant; the injury must relate directly to the impact or percussion, but the impact or percussion may be an indirect effect of the defendant's actions. R v Burstow established that [...] "inflict" [...] was a near synonym of cause: in Lord Hope's view, they were synonymous, except that the outcome of the former must be unpleasant. This was applied in R v Dica and R v Konzani, two cases of knowingly risking passing on HIV without <b>explicit</b> <b>consent.</b>|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two major}} {{functional}} distinctions when considering warlords vis-à-vis {{their relationship with the}} state. The first is one in which the warlord functions within the political framework through a degree of bargaining with the state regime so the warlord, sometimes individually and sometimes in a coalition with other warlords, is acting with the <b>explicit</b> <b>consent</b> or at least in accord with the regime. This can be viewed as [...] "cooperative warlord politics". The other is one in which the warlord is operating independently of the state and is viewed as a rebel, insurgent or strategic political competitor of the regime. This is commonly viewed as [...] "ungoverned warlordism." [...] Warlords can also fall into a hybrid category, temporarily joining a warlord coalition in collusion with the regime or defecting for political expedience--transitioning from one paradigm to the other based upon strategic interests.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} a number of Supreme Court cases {{concerning}} what constitutes valid congressional consent to an interstate compact. [...] In Virginia v.

(One example the court gave was a state moving some goods from a distant state to itself, it would not require Congressional approval to contract with another state to use its canals for transport.) According to the Court, the Compact Clause requires congressional consent only if the agreement among the states is [...] "directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States". The congressional consent issue is at the center of the current debate over the constitutionality of the not yet effective National Popular Vote Interstate Compact entered into by several states plus the District of Columbia.|$|E

2500|$|As {{medical science}} advances, {{the number of}} people who could be helped by organ donors {{increases}} continuously. As opportunities to save lives increase with new technologies and procedures, {{the number of people}} willing to donate organs needs to increase as well. In order to respect individual autonomy, voluntary consent must be determined for the individual's disposition of their remains following death. There are two main methods for determining voluntary consent: [...] "opt in" [...] (only those who have given <b>explicit</b> <b>consent</b> are donors) and [...] "opt out" [...] (anyone who has not refused consent to donate is a donor). In terms of an opt-out or presumed consent system, it is assumed that individuals do intend to donate their organs to medical use when they expire. Opt-out legislative systems dramatically increase effective rates of consent for donation (the so-called default effect). For example, Germany, which uses an opt-in system, has an organ donation consent rate of 12% among its population, while Austria, a country with a very similar culture and economic development, but which uses an opt-out system, has a consent rate of 99.98%.|$|E
