Several groups of ants cultivate fungi {{in the order}} Agaricales as their primary food source, while ambrosia beetles cultivate various species of fungi in the bark of trees that they infest.

At least one species of stingless bee has a relationship with a fungus in the genus Monascus, where the larvae consume and depend on fungus transferred from old to new nests. Termites on the African savannah are also known to cultivate fungi, and yeasts of the genera Candida and Lachancea inhabit the gut of a wide range of insects, including neuropterans, beetles, and cockroaches; it is not known whether these fungi benefit their hosts. Fungi ingrowing dead wood are essential for xylophagous insects (e.g. woodboring beetles). They deliver nutrients needed by xylophages to nutritionally scarce dead wood. [...] Thanks to this nutritional enrichment the larvae of woodboring insect is able to grow and develop to adulthood.

50|$|An M.Sc. {{course in}} {{mycology}} was developed, and much productive research was undertaken, both into aquatic ascomycetes and hyphomycetes, and {{in studies of}} the processes of spore production, release and dispersal.

Spore Liberation (1965), not a revision of the former, summarized fields of recent research to reveal how spore liberation was fundamental to understanding the structure of <b>fungal</b> <b>fruiting</b> <b>bodies</b> and bryophyte sporogonia. A full revision combining both works in the light of much further research appeared as Fungal Spores, Their Liberation and Dispersal in 1971. His textbook The Biology of Fungi, for those commencing formal study of fungi, was first published in 1961 and was fully revised in later editions.

5000|$|Cherry {{leaf spot}} {{is caused by}} the ascomycete fungus Blumeriella jaapii (formerly known as Coccomyces hiemalis)Phloeosporella padi. This fungus overwinters in dead leaves on the ground as its main form of survival. In the spring, apothecia develop on these leaves. Ascospores are {{produced}} in these <b>fungal</b> <b>fruiting</b> <b>bodies</b> and are forcibly ejected during rainy periods for about 6-8 weeks, starting at petal fall. This is the telemorph or sexual stage and results in new genetic recombination and variation for the disease.This pathogen mainly affects and is most noticeable on the leaves of cherry trees. The most obvious symptom of this disease is the yellowing of leaves before they drop in the early spring. Infected leaves are filled with numerous black lesions that cover an obvious portion of the leaf. [...] These lesions first appear as small purple spots which turn red to brown and then black. Most spots are circular but can amalgamate to form large, irregular dead patches. [...] These spots tend to enlarge and separate from healthy tissue. Lastly, they drop out of the leaf giving a “shot-hole” appearance. This shot hole effect is more common on sour than on sweet cherries. In more severe and advanced cases, lesions are found on the fruit, petioles, and stems. Leaves with lesions present typically fall off early in the growing season and it is common for seriously affected trees to be defoliated by midsummer. Leaves severely infected by the disease turn very yellow before falling off.|$|E

5000|$|A bolete {{is a type}} of <b>fungal</b> <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> {{characterized}} by the presence of a pileus that is clearly differentiated from the stipe, with a spongy surface of pores (rather than gills) {{on the underside of the}} pileus. [...] "Bolete" [...] is also the English common name for fungal species having this kind of morphology.|$|R
50|$|The pileus is the {{technical}} {{name for the}} cap, or cap-like part, of a basidiocarp or ascocarp (<b>fungal</b> <b>fruiting</b> <b>body)</b> that supports a spore-bearing surface, the hymenium. The hymenium (hymenophore) may consist of lamellae, tubes, or teeth, {{on the underside of}} the pileus. A pileus is characteristic of agarics, boletes, some polypores, tooth fungi, and some ascomycetes.|$|R
5000|$|This fungus overwinters in {{dead leaves}} on the ground. In early spring (about petal fall), <b>fungal</b> <b>fruiting</b> <b>bodies</b> called apothecia develop in these leaves. Spores (ascospores) are {{produced}} in the apothecia and are forcibly discharged starting at petal fall. These ascospores are spread by wind or rain to the healthy, new, green leaves and thus serve as the primary inoculum in a new growing season. The ascospores can stick to the leaf and if a film of water and optimal temperature is present, germinate within hours of adhesion. Upon germination, the ascospores can enter the leaf through the stomata (natural openings) {{on the underside of}} the leaf. [...] Ascospores cannot enter immature stomata very effectively. [...] These ascospores grow in the intercellular spaces in the leaf. Incubation time will vary depending on the amount of available moisture and temperatures. The small purple lesions can appear within 5 days if there are damp conditions and the temperature remains steady between 60 and 68 degrees F. This incubation period could take as long as 15 days though if lower temperatures and drier conditions occur. Generally leaves become less susceptible to the disease as they grow older during the course of the growing season. [...] The first sign of disease may be on the suckers close to the ground. This is considered to be the primary reproduction cycle of cherry leaf spot. [...] However, infection from this primary cycle is fairly low but is essential for the pathogen to be able to produce secondary spores.|$|E

40|$|Hydrophobins are {{abundant}} small hydrophobic proteins that are {{present on the}} surfaces of many filamentous fungi. The chestnut blight pathogen Cryphonectria parasitica was shown to produce a class II hydrophobin, cryparin. Cryparin is the most abundant protein produced by this fungus when grown in liquid culture. When the fungus is growing on chestnut trees, cryparin is found only in the fungal fruiting body walls. Deletion of the gene encoding cryparin resulted in a culture phenotype typical of hydrophobin deletion mutants of other fungi, i. e., easily wettable (nonhydrophobic) hyphae. When grown on the natural substrate of the fungus, however, cryparin-null mutation strains were unable to normally produce its <b>fungal</b> <b>fruiting</b> <b>bodies.</b> Although the stromal pustules showed normal development initially, {{they were unable to}} erupt through the bark of the tree.

40|$|Despite the {{critical}} importance of fungi as symbionts with plants, resources for animals, and drivers of ecosystem function, the spatiotemporal distributions of fungi remain poorly understood. The belowground {{life cycle of}} fungi {{makes it difficult to}} assess spatial patterns and dynamic processes even with recent molecular techniques. Here we offer an explicit spatiotemporal Bayesian inference of the drivers behind spatial distributions from investigation of a Swiss inventory of <b>fungal</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>bodies.</b> The unique inventory includes three temperate forest sites in which a total of 73 952 <b>fungal</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>bodies</b> were recorded systematically in a spatially explicit design between 1992 and 2006. Our motivation is to understand how broad-scale climate factors may influence spatiotemporal dynamics of <b>fungal</b> <b>fruiting</b> within forests, and if any such effects vary between two functional groups, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and saprotrophic fungi. For both groups we asked: 1) how consistent are the locations of fruiting patches, the sizes of patches, the quantities of <b>fruit</b> <b>bodies,</b> and of prevalence (occupancy) ? 2) Do the annual spatial characteristics of <b>fungal</b> <b>fruiting</b> change systematically over time? 3) Are spatial characteristics of <b>fungal</b> <b>fruiting</b> driven by climatic variation? We found high inter-annual continuity in fruiting for both functional groups. The saprotrophic species were characterised by small patches with variable <b>fruit</b> <b>body</b> counts. In contrast, ECM species were present in larger, but more distinctly delimited patches. The spatial characteristics of the fungal community were only indirectly influenced by climate. However, climate variability influenced overall yields and prevalence, which again links to spatial structure of <b>fruit</b> <b>bodies.</b> Both yield and prevalence were correlated with the amplitudes of occurrence and of <b>fruit</b> <b>body</b> counts, but only prevalence influenced the spatial range.
