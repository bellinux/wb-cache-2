40|$|International audienceThe <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> {{choice is}} rarely {{analysed}} {{in the literature}} as {{the start of a}} firm's international development whereas retail companies enter foreign markets with few locations before expanding over time by adding new ones. This contrast suggests that research works use a static concept, an <b>entry</b> <b>mode,</b> within a dynamic process, the one of internationalisation. This paradox suggests an interesting distinction, one which differentiates the <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> from the expansion mode.

To answer this question, we review empirical studies in international <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> research between the years 1980 and 2006.

AuthorsJesper Mårtensson, Joep van den BrinkSubjectMaster Thesis in International Marketing KeywordsInternationalization, <b>Entry</b> <b>Mode,</b> BRIC-markets, Internal & External Factors, Effectuation & Causation. Question(s) How do {{internal and external}} factors influence the <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> {{decision for}} Swedish business-to-businessfirms internationalizing to India?How can the <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> decision process be characterized for Swedish business-to-businessfirms when internationalizing to India?How does the <b>entry</b> <b>mode,</b> used by Swedish business-to-business firms in India, follows the Transaction Cost Approach to <b>entry</b> <b>modes</b> and the Resource Based Approach to entry modes?PurposeThe {{purpose of this study}} is to get a deeper understanding of how internal and external factors influence the <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> decision forSwedish business-to-business firms that internationalize to India. Furthermore, the study aims at bringing in a process-based view of the <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> decision literature. The study also aims to investigate <b>entry</b> <b>modes</b> used in India to see how it followsthe recommendations of the transaction cost and the Resource Based explanation to <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> choice. MethodQualitative multiple case study consisting of three cases. The data was collected through personal interviews. The cases have been analyzed using a within-case analysis and a cross-case analysis. ConclusionThe findings of our study show that firms evaluate just a few internal and external factors when internationalizing to India. As can be derived from our study, the product has an importantinfluence on the <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> decision for the investigated firms. The more standardized a product is, the easier it is to penetrate the Indian market using low-control <b>entry</b> <b>modes.</b> The higher the complexity of the product, the more knowledge is required from the firm and thus, the higher the likelihood for a firm to internationalize to the Indian market using high-control <b>entry</b> <b>modes.</b> It is also shown that firms tend to rely on earlier experiences when internationalizing to India, whereas this could limit the firms for choosing the right <b>entry</b> <b>mode.</b> Furthermore, the specific market barriers for the Indian market have an influence on the <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> decision as well. It is also found that firms that have a causational approach to foreign <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> will not allow for a rapid switch in the level of foreign involvement before they have reliable information as a base for the decision. The firms with an effectual approach made their <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> decision based on selecting an <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> with low resource commitment, seeing their achieved turnovers in India as a bonus.

40|$|Topic:When an MNC {{seeks to}} enter a foreign country, it must choose the most {{appropriate}} <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> for that specific market, such as exporting, licensing, a turnkey project, franchising, joint ventures or wholly-owned subsidiaries. There are many factors which affect the choice of <b>entry</b> <b>modes.</b> Influential factors contributing to the <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> decision can have different degrees of impact for each particular country. As a consequence, an MNC has to use different <b>entry</b> <b>modes</b> in order {{to adapt to the}} specific situations it faces in its international expansion strategy. Research Problem: Our research problem is to find the answer to two specific research questions while investigating in a particular MNC: Starbucks. The relevant questions are: (1.) What factors affected Starbucks’ <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> decisions? (2.) Which <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> strategies did Starbucks use foreign markets and why? Method: We collected data through a qualitative method. We regarded that a qualitative research method would provide us the necessary data to understand <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> decisions. We collected data through literature, books, journals, and Internet resources. We have decided to focus our qualitative research on exploring Starbucks’ <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> decision in some specific markets. In particular, we have concentrated on Spain, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Conclusions: The choice of <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> is a critical decision made by MNCs. The choice is influenced by several factors; we have divided these into internal and external factors. We have found both groups are important in the decisions made by Starbucks. However, the degree of influence is different in each case. Moreover, it is possible that some influential factors in the choice of <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> can differ by case. Finally, we have found external factors have been critical in affecting Starbucks’ choice of <b>entry</b> <b>modes.</b> Starbucks has sought to adapt to those external factors and local needs and requirements by using different <b>entry</b> <b>modes...</b>|$|R

After incorporating various global strategic variables into an electric framework of the factors influencing the <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> choice, this paper tests both {{the validity of the}} overall framework and the importance of each <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> determinant in differentiating among <b>entry</b> <b>modes.</b> This is done based on ninety-six multinational managers' responses to a survey questionnaire concerning their <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> decision experiences.

40|$|Expanding {{to foreign}} markets is {{increasingly}} popular for companies. The company {{has to decide}} which organisational structure, <b>entry</b> <b>mode,</b> {{to use in the}} new market. Factors affecting the change from one <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> to another have obtained little attention. This thesis concerns Swedish companies’ changes of <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> in Taiwan. The purpose is to investigate which factors that serve as triggers respectively barriers for the change of <b>entry</b> <b>modes,</b> to be able to examine which theories {{that can be used to}} explain and support mode changes. Different theories concerning choice and change of <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> have been investigated. Based on the theories, a model including factors influencing <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> changes was established. The model has contributed a foundation for the empirical findings as well as the analysis of the companies. As a method, a qualitative approach was conducted through interviews with five Swedish companies having a subsidiary in Taiwan. The criterion for the companies was that they should have a subsidiary in Taiwan, but entered the market with another <b>entry</b> <b>mode.</b> Considering the small number of companies and to obtain an understanding about the <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> changes, a qualitative investigation was the most suitable. Conclusions that could be drawn were that the competitive Taiwanese market had triggered some of the companies to change their <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> to a subsidiary in order to be present in the market. Increased sales volume did also have evident affect on why the companies changed their <b>entry</b> <b>mode.</b> The investigation also gives indications that barriers tend to be of internal and firm specific character.

30|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} a phenomenal {{growth in the}} number of Chinese enterprises “going global.” Drawing on three leading theoretical perspectives including the transaction cost theory, organizational capability theory and eclectic theory, this paper develops hypotheses to test how country risk and cultural distance are associated with <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> choices of enterprises from China. Based on a sample of 167 Chinese companies, an empirical investigation has been conducted employing logistic regression and hierarchical regression analyses. Our results show that country risk and cultural distance have significant impact on <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> choice. With the increase of country risk or cultural distance, businesses prefer non-ownership-based <b>entry</b> <b>modes</b> such as trade and licensing. However, <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> choice is also noticeably influenced by the interaction between country risk and cultural distance, which is a new finding of international <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> research. Furthermore, private enterprises are more likely to adopt high-involvement <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> than the state-owned enterprises, and service enterprises are less likely to use high-involvement <b>entry</b> <b>mode,</b> which suggests that different approaches are used to deal with country risk and cultural distance by various types of enterprises.|$|R

In {{the area of}} services, {{it can be found}} that there are soft and hard services, and knowledge-intensive and not-knowledge-intensive services. This study is focusing on the internationalization process in knowledge-intensive soft-service companies. According to previous studies {{there is a lack of}} research on this part of the service industry concerning the foreign market <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> decision and the factors influencing the choice of foreign market <b>entry</b> <b>mode.</b> When entering a foreign market there are several different factors influencing the choice of <b>entry</b> <b>mode.</b> The purpose of this study is to provide a better understanding of which <b>entry</b> <b>modes</b> are used by knowledge-intensive soft-service companies and what the <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> decision is based on. In this study two research questions were designed to reach the research purpose. Based on the research questions a frame of reference was created, this was the base for the layout of the data collection. The research approach in this study is qualitative. The companies selected for this study are four staffing and recruitment companies, two from Norway and two from Sweden. The study shows and explains which <b>entry</b> <b>modes</b> these four companies adopt and what factors are influencing their choice of foreign market <b>entry</b> <b>mode.</b> The collected data from the four companies is presented, discussed and analyzed first case-by-case and then by a cross-case comparison, which then leads to the findings and conclusions of the study.

One of the key decisions {{in the process of}} foreign market entry is selecting market <b>entry</b> <b>modes</b> since selection of <b>entry</b> <b>modes</b> is a significant determiner in the success of company. <b>Entry</b> <b>mode</b> selection is influenced by external and internal factors. Therefore, company has to consider external and internal factors and choose the most appropriate <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> which will maximize its chance to succeed in the chosen foreign market. The purpose of this thesis is to identify the factors that influence <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> decisions of Swedish MNCs when entering the Chinese market. A research question regarding influencing factors in <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> decisions is formulated. Root’s theory and Hollensen’s work on <b>entry</b> <b>modes</b> are presented in theoretical framework which is followed by conceptual framework where the theory and literatures used are summarized to provide clearer picture to the readers. This research is a qualitative one and uses case study approach. Data regarding to <b>entry</b> <b>modes</b> and influencing factors is collected from three Swedish MNCs Electrolux, Sandvik and Ericsson through interviews.

Despite many years of interest from researchers, the entry choice strategy area is still considered a frontier issue. Researchers have suggested that managing risk is one of the major strategic objectives for managers of multinational firms. Furthermore, risk is regarded as a key determinant in relation to <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> choice. Research has found that the various risk variables should be regarded as an integrated measure in relation to <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> choice and not single measures. By looking at a single risk variable, the firm might analyse the situation incorrectly, which may lead to an incorrect <b>entry</b> <b>mode.</b> This study investigates the relationship between <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> choice, perceived risk and risk tolerance for Danish firms entering Central and Eastern Europe by using a probabilistic model.

The preferred model for predicting <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> included years of CEE experience, number of competitors, cultural difference, consumer taste and future market potential. In addition, the analysis showed that Danish firms generally are relatively risk averse.

40|$|A firm can deploy {{a variety}} of {{arrangements}} (<b>entry</b> <b>modes)</b> like wholly owned subsidiaries, joint ventures, contracts, and export modes to implement its product market strategies in foreign countries. Each of these arrangements entails decisions about the location of production facilities and/or marketing operations, {{and the type of}} ownership of these operations. The choice of an <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> is of strategic importance to a firm because it can involve investment of substantial amount of resources and has a strong bearing on the firm's marketing mix. Due to its strategic importance, the <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> choice phenomenon has been extensively researched. In the past, seven major theories have been proposed but none is able to explain the choice from the complete set of <b>entry</b> <b>modes.</b> Thus, there exists a gap between the theory and practice of <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> choice. This study provides breakthrough on two fronts. First, it develops a new theory of <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> choice grounded in the resource-based perspective of the firm. The theory posits that the decision to locate its production and/or marketing operations in a country is related to the actualizability of the firm's competitive advantage in that country. However, the ownership decision is related to the sustainability of that advantage. Second, based on this theory, a model is developed which explains <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> choices from the complete set of <b>entry</b> <b>modes.</b> Mail survey responses of Presidents/CEOs of 163 American firms with international operations support the model. The proposed framework is an effort to fill the gap between theory and practice of <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> choice. It is expected to make a substantial contribution toward developing a sound theory of international operations of the firm. The framework is broader in scope than the extant theories because it transcends across industries and nationalities of firms...|$|R

Why {{did they}} select those <b>entry</b> <b>modes?</b> And {{how did they}} manage their {{internal}} and external network structure during the <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> evolution process?    Purpose: We describe and explain how Toyota conquered the European market {{from the perspective of}} <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> and network. And we also intend to provide some useful information to the companies that want to gain experience before entering into the European market.   Method: We design this thesis as a case study about the <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> of Toyota in the European market. In order to get an in-depth understanding of the research problem, the qualitative research approach is chosen. During the analysis part, all the information is derived from the secondary documents, such as website, articles and so on. Conclusion: After the analysis the process of Toyota developed in the European market, we found that after careful consideration about both internal and external factors, Toyota usually prefers to conquer a new market with a relevant low risk <b>entry</b> <b>mode,</b> such as exporting or licensing, in the beginning. Then, with the increase of their experience as well as the growth of network, they began to change to a higher risk level <b>entry</b> <b>mode,</b> like joint venture or wholly owned subsidiaries. During the evolution process, in order to provide an effective way of interaction between headquarters and subsidiaries, Toyota’s structure changed from time to time.

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the factors that enhance <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> choice {{in the context of}} international new ventures (INVs). In this paper, we hypothesize that the characteristics of INVs’ products or services can explain their preference for equity <b>entry</b> <b>modes.</b> We also hypothesize that the inter-firm networks in which INVs are embedded play a deciding role in their choice of non-equity <b>entry</b> <b>modes.</b> When INVs are in inter-firm networks in which activities are developed to manage them, non-equity <b>entry</b> <b>modes</b> are preferred. We have adopted an effectuation approach to study the influence of different inter-firm network management activities on <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> choice. In short, we have studied the effect of developing inter-firm network knowledge exchange, coordination, adaptation, conflict resolution and resource sharing management activities. In this paper we attempt to contribute to international entrepreneurship studies by reconciling the most widely accepted approaches to <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> choice (Transactional Cost Economics, Organizational Capabilities-based and Network perspective) and international new ventures. Our findings show that the technological complexity of INVs’ products/services explain their preference for equity <b>entry</b> <b>modes.</b> Additionally, the development of network management activities among the networked firms determines the INVs’ preference for non-equity <b>entry</b> <b>modes.</b> Our results draw a decision model that differs from the ones derived from previous perspectives, which highlight the role of different characteristics of international new ventures.

40|$|Purpose This paper {{examines}} international decision-making, {{information processing}} and related performance implications. We explore {{the relationship between}} international decision-making and problem-solving dissensions related to <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> decisions. In addition, we investigate the effects of dissension on <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> performance, and the moderating effect of the foreign direct investment (FDI) vs. non-FDI decision {{as it relates to}} dissension-mode performance. Despite their significance from an information processing perspective, these issues have not been sufficiently explored in international <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> research. Design/methodology/approach This research presents data collected from 233 privately owned internationalized Chinese firms. The analysis in this investigation includes hierarchical ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Findings The findings suggest an inverse U-shaped relationship between dissension and <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> performance, as opposed to a linear one, and a moderating effect of FDI vs. non-FDI decisions on this curvilinear dissension–performance association. These findings support and refine the rationale of the information processing perspective. Originality/value These findings add realistic elements to the alleged “rational” international decision-making doctrine assumed in previous <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> literature. Our findings show the importance of the heterogeneity of information processing in <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> strategic decision-making processes (SDMPs), and its effects on specific decision types. We believe {{that this is the first}} empirical study to use an information processing perspective to examine the effects of SDMPs on <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> performance...|$|R

To this end, a survey was conducted to investigate the linkage between <b>entry</b> <b>modes</b> and characteristics of franchising firms. The logit model and regression analysis were {{used to test the}} hypotheses. Findings reveal four factors that significantly influence international franchisors’ <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> choices including cultural and geographic distance, international market experience, risk spreading, and maturity of the franchising system.|$|R
40|$|So far the {{critical}} {{choice of the}} <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> for a target country has been examined ignoring the special features of firms. Particularly, {{the impact of the}} wide variation of business models of software firms has been ignored. This multi case study investigates the relation between the business model and the <b>entry</b> <b>mode,</b> of eight software firms. The results imply that the product strategy and the service and implementation model of a software firm are closely connected to the <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> choice, while the distribution model of intangible software products {{does not seem to have}} an impact on the operation mode.
