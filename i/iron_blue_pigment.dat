30|$|XRF {{analysis}} revealed that {{in the majority of}} blues used in the Flora Graeca paintings copper and cobalt were present, suggesting the use of either smalt or a copper blue (such as blue bice, verditer or azurite) (Fig.  4 i). It is likely however, that the source of the cobalt in this instance was from the paper substrate itself. Under in situ microscopic examination at ×  400, {{it was clear that the}} particle morphology of Bauer’s <b>blue</b> <b>pigments</b> was not consistent with smalt, while that of the <b>blue</b> <b>pigment</b> within the paper structure was. Bauer’s <b>blue</b> <b>pigment</b> appears as small, finely divided, rounded and semi-opaque particles, in contrast with smalt (amorphous, conchoidally-fractured, angular and transparent particles). As noted above, particles matching this description and containing cobalt were clearly visible within the fibres in all instances of Bauer’s papers examined under microscopy, suggesting that the source of the cobalt was likely the paper itself, rather than the <b>blue</b> <b>pigment.</b>|$|R

40|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>pigment</b> {{produced}} by several genetically closely related strains {{belonging to the}} Pseudomonas fluorescens group {{was the cause of}} the blue mozzarella cases. From such spoilage events derived considerable economic losses and recently also lawsuits for several dairy factories in Italy. The identification of the chemical nature and a certain molecular trait related to the <b>blue</b> <b>pigment</b> production could be useful to identify the blue spoiler strains (i. e. the source of the contamination). Additionally, gain understanding the conditions of its production could help to prevent the spoilage event. For these reasons, 4 genetically closely related strains (2 producing and 2 not producing the <b>blue</b> <b>pigment)</b> were studied. The growth curves of the strains demonstrated that the growth trends were similar between the 4 strains and the pigment production was visible when the blue strains reached 107 UFC/ml. The growth of the strains and the pigment production demonstrated that the ability to produce the <b>blue</b> <b>pigment</b> is related to the bacterial cell density and to the presence of oxygen. Therefore, the four strains were analyzed by the complete sequencing of the genomes and the trascriptomes to identify the metabolic pathways probably involved in the production of the <b>blue</b> <b>pigment.</b> The completely sequenced genome of the Pseudomonas fluorescens strains A 506, closely related to the four strains, was used as a template for the analysis. These results clearly indicate that the <b>blue</b> <b>pigment</b> is related to iron metabolism and suggest a role as siderophore for iron uptake as several others pigments {{produced by}} strains belonging to Pseudomonas genus.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{production}} of pigments by adding different amount of Co and calcination at different temperatures were undertaken. Co-willemite <b>blue</b> <b>pigments</b> were produced by using ZnO powders produced from metal slags. To determine {{the effect of}} the Co concentration and calcination temperature on the colour, The resulting pigments were used in double and single firing transparent glazes and porselainised stoneware. Their colour properties were characterised by using UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The colours obtained after glazing were defined by L*a*b * measurements. Inroduction Industrially available <b>blue</b> ceramic <b>pigments,</b> with the exception of vanadium-zircon blue, contain Co. Co-olivin (Co 2 SiO 4) and Co-Al spinel (CoAl 2 O 4) pigments are prepared using a high amount of cobalt oxide (about 30 - 50 wt%) which is considered to be toxic, hazardous and very expensive [1]. Therefore, the synthesis of cobalt-based <b>blue</b> <b>pigments</b> must be optimised in order to minimise the production costs as well as the negative environmental impact due to the high Co content.
