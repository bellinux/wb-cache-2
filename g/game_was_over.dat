5|$|A season {{highlight}} was {{the final}} game against Stanford's arch-rival California at California Memorial Stadium, the last game of the regular season. Before the game, both teams were undefeated and Stanford had not beaten California since 1905. Nevers did not play due to a broken ankle. Late in the game, California was leading 20–3; California coach Andy Smith, sure the <b>game</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> began substituting regular players. Warner {{seized the opportunity to}} combine passing with the trick plays for which he was known (a fake reverse and a full spinner), and Stanford made a comeback. The game ended in a 20–20 tie.|$|E
5|$|Despite Germany's {{comparatively}} {{low expectations}} when for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the team {{advanced to the}} finals; Kahn conceded only three goals {{in the course of}} the competition, two of which were in the Final. Playing the final match with torn ligaments in his right ring finger, Kahn conceded the first goal by fumbling a rebounded shot from Rivaldo to the feet of striker Ronaldo in the 67th minute. Once the <b>game</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> with Brazil as the new champion, he stood alone and disappointed in his goal; nevertheless he refused to blame his injury for his mistake.|$|E
5|$|Mississippi scored another {{touchdown}} before halftime, and the Hokies {{clung to}} a 17–14 lead {{at the beginning}} of the second half. That three-point lead quickly evaporated, however, as 21seconds into the third quarter, Mississippi's Steve Hindman ran for 79yards and a touchdown to give Mississippi a 21–17 lead. Ole Miss added 13 more points before the <b>game</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> and earned the victory, 34–17. The Virginia Tech offense was stymied by repeated turnovers. Tech fumbled the ball threetimes and Tech quarterback Humphries threw twointerceptions. Tech committed 120yards in penalties and was held to just twopassing yards for the entire game.|$|E

5|$|From {{that point}} on, the Colts {{took over the}} game. Four plays after the ensuing kickoff, Colts {{defensive}} back Bob Sanders intercepted Grossman's pass and returned it 38 yards to the Bears 41-yard line. Chicago's defense eventually forced a punt, but Smith's 32-yard kick pinned the Bears back at their own 8-yard line. The Bears drove to their own 47, but on a fourth down conversion attempt, tight end Desmond Clark dropped a potential first down reception after being leveled by defensive back Matt Giordano. The Colts subsequently called eight consecutive Dominic Rhodes runs before turning the ball over on downs themselves, leaving only 1:42 remaining in regulation. Five plays later, the <b>game</b> <b>was</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E
5|$|Oral history {{provides}} {{two different}} accounts of Andrianjaka's succession {{to the throne}} of the Kingdom of Imerina. According to popular legend, Ralambo devised a test to determine which of his two sons was most fit to rule: he would summon them both to join him at his capital in Ambohidrabiby, and whichever of his two sons reached him soonest would inherit his kingdom. In one account of this legend, Andrianjaka was reportedly engrossed in strategizing a win in a difficult game of fanorona and so refused to admit audience to the royal messenger until after the <b>game</b> <b>was</b> <b>over.</b> During this delay, his older brother Andriantompokoindrindra received his father's message and rushed home; he was thus awarded Ralambo's title and kingdom. However, this tale continues, Andriantompokoindrindra's claim to power {{was rejected by the}} public, and he was soon forced to cede the throne to Andrianjaka. In an alternate account of the succession tale, it is Andriantompokoindrindra (not Andrianjaka) who was said to be preoccupied with the fanorona game—a version in keeping with the oral tradition that credits him with the game's invention and popularization at court—and his refusal to return to his father until after the game had finished led Ralambo to choose Andrianjaka as his successor. One source states that the summons was not a test, but rather occurred during the aforementioned incident when Ralambo was besieged in his capital by the Antsihanaka warriors and was genuinely in need of his sons' assistance.|$|E
5|$|A {{standard}} adult football match {{consists of}} two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most {{commonly referred to as}} stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, {{towards the end of the}} half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90minutes had elapsed and the <b>game</b> <b>was</b> <b>over.</b> The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.|$|E

25|$|Garner ran {{straight}} ahead for five yards, but {{was surrounded by}} five Stanford players. However, while being tackled, he managed to pitch the ball back to Rodgers. It was at this moment, believing that Garner had been tackled and the <b>game</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> that several Stanford players on the sideline and the entire Stanford band (which had been waiting behind the south end zone) ran onto the field in celebration.|$|E

25|$|But as it {{was pointed}} out by Todorov and by Logunov, Mestvirishvili, and Petrov, even in his {{mutilated}} form, the page proofs of Hilbert contain the correct Lagrange density of the gravitational field, which in conjunction with Hilbert action results in the correct gravitational field equations. To derive the gravitational field equations from his action was not more than a minor exercise for Hilbert. Therefore, the <b>game</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> with Hilbert's action.|$|E
25|$|The World XI {{never looked}} like {{challenging}} this total. They lost five of their top six batsmen — Sehwag, Kallis, Lara, Dravid and Pietersen — for single figures, to collapse to 5 for 82 inside 22 overs. Only Sangakkara's innings gave any hope, {{but when he}} was out for 65 to leave the World XI on 6 for 101, needing 7 runs an over off the last 22 overs, the <b>game</b> <b>was</b> <b>over.</b> Australia eventually wrapped up the World XI's innings for 162 to record a comprehensive 93-run victory.|$|E
25|$|On Oakland's first {{offensive}} play, Ray Nitschke {{shot through}} a gap and literally upended fullback Hewritt Dixon {{in what was}} one of Nitschke's signature plays of his entire career. The hit was so vicious, it prompted Jerry Green, a Detroit News columnist sitting in the press box with fellow journalists, to say in a deadpan, that the <b>game</b> <b>was</b> <b>over.</b> The Packers opened up the scoring with Don Chandler's 39-yard field goal after marching 34 yards on their first drive of the game. Meanwhile, the Raiders were forced to punt on their first two possessions.|$|E

25|$|But even so, it {{was clear}} by now the <b>game</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> as the Jaguars held a {{commanding}} 41–7 lead. Marino was benched in the second half, and his replacement, Damon Huard, completed just five of 16 passes for 46 yards {{in the rest of}} the game. Meanwhile, Jacksonville continued to increase their lead. On the third play of the second half, Fiedler threw a 70-yard touchdown pass to Smith. Later on in the third quarter, he threw a 38-yard touchdown pass to Alvis Whitted. And in the final quarter, another fumble from Johnson set up the final points of the game, a 5-yard touchdown run by Howard.|$|E
25|$|Half an hour {{into the}} final day, Warne finally turned the tide back in favour of the Australians and {{effectively}} sealed the victory. Thorpe pushed forward to a fuller delivery and missed it, then Hick was caught {{off the back of}} his bat after the ball ricocheted off his arm. Gooch added 30 with Gatting and another 30 with wicketkeeper Steve Rhodes, but both managed to nick the new ball to Healy off McDermott's bowling. Warne cleaned up the tail to finish with match figures of 11–108 and pick up the man-of-the-match award, and the <b>game</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> before tea on the final day, England mustering 323.|$|E

Once {{when the}} two of them were playing Liubo a message came that the beacons on the northern border had been lit; King Anxi wanted to stop the game and discuss the situation with his ministers, but his brother told him not to worry as it was only the king of Zhao on a hunting trip, and so they continued playing. The king was worried and could not concentrate on the game, but after the <b>game</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> news came that it was indeed the king of Zhao out hunting.|$|E

25|$|The First Test {{was played}} in Mumbai on 27 February-1 March 2001. The <b>game</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> in {{only three days}} as Australia {{dominated}} from the beginning, putting India in to bat and then dismissing them for only 176 runs. Glenn McGrath took 3–19 and Shane Warne 4–47, Sachin Tendulkar top scoring for India with 76. Australia responded with 349 {{on the backs of}} centuries by Matthew Hayden (119) and Adam Gilchrist (122). Harbhajan Singh took 4–121. India's second innings was barely better than their first, Tendulkar again top scoring with 65 in a total of 219. Needing only 47 runs to win, Australia's openers knocked them off in 7 overs, taking Australia to a 10 wicket victory and a 1–0 lead in the series.|$|E
25|$|Wisconsin {{opened the}} second half with the ball and once again marched right down the field and Melvin Gordon scored his third {{touchdown}} of the game on a 15-yard run. Wisconsin put some more points on the board late {{in the third quarter}} with a 27-yard field goal by Kyle French. On the first play of the fourth quarter, RB Corey Clement scored on a 5-yard touchdown run. With Purdue unable to move the ball and Wisconsin just running the clock down, the <b>game</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> by a score of 41–10. Wisconsin stuffed the stats sheet as they out gained Purdue 546 yards to 180 yards. Wisconsin out rushed Purdue by a clip of 388 yards to 45 yards. Wisconsin had 22 first downs, 10 more than Purdue.|$|E
25|$|Tottenham ended October with a North London derby against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, Spurs {{entered the}} game without Luka Modrić, Aaron Lennon and the {{suspended}} Jermain Defoe and the absences meant that David Bentley {{made his first}} {{start of the season}} against his former club. The first half played out on level pegging until late in the half when a cross let Robin van Persie poke the ball home to give Arsenal the lead. Immediately following, Poor defending from Spurs allowed Cesc Fàbregas to double Arsenal's lead, just 50 seconds later. Tottenham entered the second half with a mountain to climb, however the <b>game</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> when more poor defending allowed Van Persie to score his second and Arsenal's third. The game ended 3–0 and Spurs ended the month in fifth place in the table.|$|E
