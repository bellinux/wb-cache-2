5|$|The World Fantasy Awards {{are split}} into ten categories, {{including}} both awards for written works and for {{professionals in the}} field. <b>Eligibility</b> <b>requirements</b> are loosely defined: works must {{have been published in}} the prior calendar year, and professionals must still be living. All types of fantasy works are accepted, regardless of subgenre or style, though whether a given work is considered to be fantasy is left up to the discretion of the nominators and judges.|$|E
5|$|After {{determining}} which <b>eligibility</b> <b>requirements</b> {{participation in a}} program requires, the recipient must also assure that individual program participant or group eligibility was correctly determined by keeping evidence of such compliance, such as maintaining documentation in participant files (e.g., copies of HIV/Aids diagnosis, copies of federal income tax returns, etc.). Furthermore, the recipient must assure that only eligible individuals or groups participated in the program by establishing strict controls of program funds to avoid non-eligible persons from receiving the specific assistance.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} a family’s monthly benefit payment depends on that family's {{specific}} characteristics and financial circumstances, {{as well as}} the overall amount of program funds available for distribution. The latest statistics show that benefits average $103 each month (2003, see table below right). It is the Puerto Rico government's responsibility to establish the <b>eligibility</b> <b>requirements</b> and benefit levels for participation in the program. The benefits are revised annually every October 1 to consider the nutritional needs of Puerto Rico's impoverished population, analyze the impact of inflation in Puerto Rico, and plan the distribution of available funds accordingly.|$|E
30|$|The only <b>eligibility</b> <b>requirement</b> for CRCD {{services}} {{is an active}} cancer diagnosis.|$|R
50|$|Reserves or National Guard {{members with}} active duty for {{training}} purposes only {{do not meet}} the basic <b>eligibility</b> <b>requirement.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{top ranked}} NPC (not {{otherwise}} qualified) at the 2014 World Championships directly qualifies, {{subject to the}} <b>eligibility</b> <b>requirement.</b>|$|R
5|$|The NHL Entry Draft, {{originally}} {{known as}} the NHL Amateur Draft, is a collective meeting in which the franchises of the National Hockey League (NHL) systematically select the exclusive rights to available amateur players who meet the <b>eligibility</b> <b>requirements</b> to play professional hockey in the NHL. First held in 1963, the draft prior to 1969 was a shorter affair. Any amateur player who was 17 {{years of age and}} older and was not already sponsored by an NHL club was eligible to be drafted. In 1969 the rules were changed so that any amateur player between the ages of 17 and 20 was eligible to be drafted. The draft has grown, and in 2010, 210 players were selected over seven rounds.|$|E
5|$|Works by {{winners and}} nominees of the Campbell Award were {{collected}} in the New Voices series of anthologies, edited by George R. R. Martin, which had five volumes covering the awards from 1973 through 1977 and which were published between 1977 and 1984. Campbell nominees and winners, such as Michael A. Burstein, who was nominated in 1996 and won in 1997, have commented that the largest effect of winning or being nominated for a Campbell is not on sales but instead that it gives credibility with established authors and publishers. Criticism has been raised about the Campbell that due to the <b>eligibility</b> <b>requirements</b> it honors writers who become well-known quickly, rather than necessarily the best or most influential authors from a historical perspective.|$|E
5|$|The {{syndicated}} version's potential contestants, {{depending on}} tryouts, {{are required to}} pass an electronically scored test comprising a set of thirty questions which must be answered within a 10-minute time limit. Contestants who fail the test are eliminated, while those who pass are interviewed for an audition by the production staff, and those who impress the staff the most are then notified by postal mail {{that they have been}} placed into a pool for possible selection as contestants. At the producers' discretion, contestants from said pool are selected to appear on actual episodes of the syndicated program; these contestants are given a phone call from staff and asked to confirm the information on their initial application form and verify that they meet all <b>eligibility</b> <b>requirements.</b> Afterwards, they are given a date to travel to the show's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show. Unlike its ABC counterpart, the syndicated version does not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company's expense; that version's contestants are instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own.|$|E
50|$|The only <b>eligibility</b> <b>requirement</b> for a head {{of state}} under the McGarvie Model would be Australian {{citizenship}} because the process for selecting {{the head of state}} is designed to ensure a non-political head of state.|$|R
50|$|The text opens declaring {{its target}} and stating ethics as the <b>eligibility</b> <b>requirement</b> for yogin, calling him as Yati. Yati {{is synonymous with}} Sanyasis, Bhiksu, Pravrajita/Pravrajitā, Sramana and Parivrajaka in ancient and medieval Hindu texts.|$|R

5|$|During the campaign, Bevin {{criticized the}} Affordable Care Act {{and called for}} {{repealing}} it in its entirety. His proposed alternatives included allowing insurance providers to compete across state lines, capping damages awarded for pain and suffering, allowing individuals to purchase health insurance with pre-tax earnings, and providing federal block grants to states {{to allow them to}} cover individuals with pre-existing conditions. He opposed tax increases and the allocation of federal earmarks. He called for massive spending cuts in the federal bureaucracy, specifically the Department of Education and the Veterans Administration, and for reforming <b>eligibility</b> <b>requirements</b> for entitlement programs, including raising age requirements, imposing means tests, and ending federal benefits to illegal immigrants. He opposed U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War and the disbursement of foreign aid to countries that deny basic freedoms to their citizens or are guilty of human rights violations. He opposed federal agribusiness subsidies and warantless federal surveillance and called for simplifying the child adoption process. Endorsed by Gun Owners of America, he pledged to resist any restrictions on the types of guns or ammunition that citizens could purchase. A supporter of congressional term limits, Bevin signed a pledge authored by the non-profit U.S. Term Limits stating that, if elected, he would co-sponsor and vote for a bill restricting individuals to three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and two terms in the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|To be {{eligible}} for the award, a player cannot have played any more than 25 regular season games previously in any single season, nor have played in more than six regular season games in each of two separate preceding seasons in any major professional league. The latter fact was perhaps most prominent when in the 1979–80 season, first-year phenom Wayne Gretzky was not eligible to win the Calder Trophy despite scoring 137 points (the previous rookie record at the time being 95), because he had played a full season the previous year in the World Hockey Association. In 1991, goaltender Ed Belfour won the Calder having previously appeared in 32 games with the Chicago Blackhawks over the 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons. Belfour was eligible for the award because nine of those appearances came during the 1990 Stanley Cup playoffs, and the other 23 appearances were made during the 1988-89 season. The nine playoff games did not count towards the regular season <b>eligibility</b> <b>requirements.</b> In 2010–11, Logan Couture was eligible for the Calder Trophy despite having played in 40 previous games (25 in the regular season and 15 in the playoffs, both in 2009–10), while Alex Pietrangelo was ineligible despite having played only 17 previous games (eight in 2008–09 and nine in 2009–10, both times sent back to juniors).|$|E
