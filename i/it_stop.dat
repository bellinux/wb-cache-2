5|$|Margaery Tyrell {{is brought}} to meet the High Sparrow, who warns her {{to stay away from}} her life of riches and sin, and recounts his past of how, as a proud cobbler, he learned his wealth-guided pursuits were lies and that the shoeless poor were closer to the truth than anyone. He then takes Margaery to see Loras, who is {{breaking}} under the Sparrows' torture, and is willing to do anything to make <b>it</b> <b>stop.</b> Margaery realises that the High Sparrow is trying to use Loras to break her, and tells him to remain strong.|$|E
25|$|This {{did not do}} much to {{stop the}} squabbling, nor did it solve the {{problems}} {{that led to the}} issues in the first place – the fight over Hercules and BOMARC and related anti-missile developments. Nor did <b>it</b> <b>stop</b> the fighting in the press. Army Colonel John Nickerson Jr. publicly denounced Wilson, while leaking details of their latest missile design, the Pershing missile. The resulting flap led to calls for Nickerson to be court-martialed and was compared to the Billy Mitchell court-martial in the 1920s.|$|E

25|$|In February 1423, a shaky truce was {{brokered}} between Zaccaria, Tocco and the Byzantines by the Venetians, {{who were}} eager to establish a common front against the Ottomans, but this did not prevent a major Ottoman raid into the peninsula by Turahan Bey in summer 1423, nor did <b>it</b> <b>stop</b> the aggressive Byzantine despot, Theodore II Palaiologos, from raiding Venetian territory and even capturing Centurione Zaccaria in June 1424. The Byzantines initially seemed content to let Tocco alone, as he too had open scores with Zaccaria, but war between the two powers was provoked in late 1426, when Tocco's forces seized the animals of Albanian herders during the latter's annual migration from the Byzantine-controlled central uplands to the plain of Elis.|$|E
25|$|The WTUL {{played a}} similar {{role in the}} strike of mostly male cloakmakers in New York City and men {{clothing}} workers in Chicago in 1910, in the 1911 garment workers strike in Cleveland and in many other actions in Iowa, Massachusetts, Missouri and Wisconsin. By 1912, however, the WTUL began to distance itself from the labor movement, supporting strike action selectively when it approved of the leadership's strategy and criticizing the male-dominated leadership of the ILGWU that it saw as unrepresentative of women workers. The WTUL's semi-official relationship with the American Federation of Labor was also strained when the United Textile Workers, an AFL affiliate, insisted that <b>it</b> <b>stop</b> providing relief for Lawrence, Massachusetts textile workers who refused {{to return to work}} during the strike led by the Industrial Workers of the World; some WTUL leaders complied, while others refused, denouncing both the AFL and the WTUL for its acquiescence in strikebreaking activities.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings to the [...] "sexual teasing" [...] lyrics, which are {{addressed}} to the men looking at her: [...] "I can be a tease, but I really wanna please you [...] Oohhh you watchin me shake it, [...] Ya can't take it, it’s blazin ...". The chorus lines; [...] "Dip it, pop it, twerk <b>it,</b> <b>stop</b> it, check on me tonight" [...] are sung in a very quick and breathless manner by Beyoncé. Bret McCabe noted that her pace could be {{compared to that of}} American singer Donna Summer. Slim Thug appears again after the second verse to perform another different verse rap: [...] "I’m checking on you boo, do what’chu do / And while you dance I’ma glance at this beautiful view / I’m keep my hands in my pants, I need to glue ’em with glue ...". Before the song ends, Beyoncé repeats the chorus lines four times as additional vocals of hers are played in the background.|$|E

500|$|Julie Emery from Heat criticised Fatboy's fashion sense, {{especially}} from the episode broadcast on 12 May 2011, saying [...] "We know clashing prints are soooooo this season, but really, Fatboy, they do nothing for you. And while we're at <b>it,</b> <b>stop</b> wearing that tinny 'F' round your neck, for flip's sake. You're not a gangster rapper, and anyway your real name's Arthur." [...] Emery also said the storyline where Fatboy asks Mercy to marry him so she {{can stay in the}} country sounded [...] "somewhat familiar", as Coronation Street was featuring a similar storyline at the same time. Amy Duncan from the Metro said Fatboy was one of her favourite young characters in EastEnders and said that, with Poppy, he [...] "bring some much-needed light into the soap". Vicky Prior from the Metro said that Fatboy [...] "is easily one of the best characters in EastEnders, able to interact seamlessly with other characters, both young and old." ...|$|E
500|$|Ruth {{continued}} with her studies at Harper Adams {{and she and}} David eventually established [...] "a good working relationship". Ruth was given the responsibility of looking after the dairy herd, before becoming {{a partner in the}} farm. Ruth and David's first child, Philippa Rose, or Pip (Helen Monks), was born in February 1993. Joanna Toye and Adrian Flynn, authors of The Archers Encyclopaedia, said Ruth took to motherhood well and did not let <b>it</b> <b>stop</b> her from playing an active part in Brookfield. The couple's second child, Joshua, was born in 1997. Ruth and David later purchased some Hereford cattle and began to establish themselves as suppliers of traditional beef. Toye and Flynn observed that Ruth and David's marriage had to be strong when the Archer siblings began arguing over who would inherit Brookfield Farm. Ruth told David that [...] "time was too precious to spend in argument" [...] and suggested they moved away. However, David's father, Phil, decided that the farm should go to the couple.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, {{the song}} was {{included}} on the Parents Music Resource Center's (PMRC) [...] "Filthy Fifteen" [...] list, for the sexual content of its lyrics. The Center's founder Tipper Gore had heard her daughter listening to the song, and considered the line [...] "Gonna dress you up in my love" [...] as exemplifying 'vulgar music'. The PMRC called upon the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) to give parents a consumer-friendly means of identifying rock records unsuitable for minors– a rating system based on lyrical content. [...] "Dress You Up" [...] received a rating of 'S', for [...] "sex and obscenity", from the RIAA. Gore commented on the song: [...] "Popular culture is morally bankrupt, flagrantly licentious and utterly materialistic—and Madonna is the worst of all." [...] According to Bruce David Forbes and H. Mahan in their book Religion and Popular Culture in America, Madonna's fans took the attitude [...] "Can't you cultural conservatives see what {{she is trying to}} do—to annoy people like you! If you don't like it, don't listen to <b>it.</b> <b>Stop</b> trying to police my morality!" [...] The campaign was successful and {{led to the creation of}} the Parental Advisory sticker.|$|E

500|$|Musically, Title {{comprises}} throwback style sound, 1950s doo wop-inspired {{songs that}} straddle {{the line between}} modern R and melodic pop. The EP's opening track, [...] "All About That Bass" [...] is a bubblegum pop, doo-wop song {{which serves as a}} throwback to 1950s and 1960s music, and contains elements from a complex mix of several genres; R, hip hop, tropical, country and rock and roll. Sonically, [...] "All About That Bass" [...] comprises an earworm hook, early 1960s soul-pop groove, scatting tempo and shimmying melody. Lyrically, [...] "All About That Bass" [...] serves as a callout to embrace one's appearance and promote a positive body image. The song metaphorically refers to the appearance of a woman's bottom. Larger women are described as [...] "bass" [...] and thinner women as [...] "treble", which Trainor implies as a joke about [...] "thick and thin". The lyric [...] "I'm bringing booty back" [...] references Justin Timberlake's [...] "SexyBack" [...] (2006). In the song, she also calls out the fashion industry for creating unreachable standards of beauty: [...] "I see the magazines working that Photoshop / We know that shit ain't real, c'mon make <b>it</b> <b>stop</b> / You know I won't be no stick-figure Barbie doll." ...|$|E
500|$|On 31 July 2009, Digital Spy {{conducted}} a poll asking {{if it was}} [...] "time to move on" [...] from Ianto. However, a week later the website did not immediately publish the results, announcing [...] "unfortunately it seems that this particular Poll {{was the subject of}} a campaign by diehard fans to distort the outcome". Neil Wilkes opined that this action by the fans [...] "suggests the answer to the question 'Have people overreacted to Ianto's death?' is quite obvious". Later, a footnote amendment noted that 31.4% said it was time to move on, [...] "while the remainder demanded RTD's head on a plate", a reference to his own wording of the original poll, which gave readers the option of moving on from Ianto, or the executive producer's head on a plate. James McCarthy of Wales Online described the reaction from some fans as [...] "sickening" [...] and quoted [...] "crazed" [...] fans on DeviantArt and Facebook who made explicit death threats against the Children of Earth writers. Gareth David-Lloyd stated he was very disappointed in those fans, whose message board conduct he does not support at all and called [...] "completely unacceptable". David-Lloyd added that he [...] "would hope the writers would be able to ignore comments like that". A number of fans were upset by the tone of the first Wales Online article, and their response prompted a follow up from McCarthy. In their comments, fans pointed out that his article disproportionately highlights what they called the [...] "ill-conceived, knee-jerk reactions" [...] of a few individuals, and stressed that these reactions in no way represent the movement to bring Ianto Jones back, which they hold as fundamentally respectful towards the show's actors and writers. Fans have distanced themselves from the small minority of extremists, and have been keen to stress their peaceful activism, described as [...] "thousands of fans who are raising money for charity, sending polite letters, and doing what we can to be supportive of the character and actor". In 2010, Doctor Who executive producer Steven Moffat told fans who contacted him that he wouldn't want to resurrect Ianto even if he could: [...] "Not reversing <b>it.</b> <b>Stop</b> asking." [...] In a 2011 poll published by the Liverpool Daily Post as part of a live Interview with writer John Fay, 70% of respondents replied that the decision to kill Ianto had been the right one, with 19% responding [...] "indifferent" [...] and only 11% stating that it had been the wrong decision, contrasting with the initial fan response. In response to a question, Fay also stated that he had not been affected by the [...] "scary" [...] fan reaction, maintaining that [...] "a universe in which fictional characters aren't 'allowed' to die is ridiculous and limiting".|$|E
