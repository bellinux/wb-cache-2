5|$|In some countries, {{fears about}} the spread of STDs have {{prompted}} the closing of bathhouseswith their private roomsin favour of sex clubs, in which all sexual activity {{takes place in the}} open, and can be observed by monitors whose <b>job</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> enforce safe-sex practices. However, proponents of bathhouses point out that closing these facilities does not prevent people from engaging in unsafe sex.|$|E

Most hunts {{where the}} object is to kill the fox will employ a terrier man, whose <b>job</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> control the terriers which may be used {{underground}} to corner or flush the fox. Often voluntary terrier men will follow the hunt as well. In the UK and Ireland, they often ride quadbikes with their terriers in boxes on their bikes.|$|E
25|$|Each {{participating}} broadcaster nominates a Head of Delegation, whose <b>job</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> co-ordinate {{the movements}} of the delegate members, and who acts as that country's representative to the EBU in the host city. Members of the delegations include performers, lyricists, composers, official press officers and—in the years where songs were performed with a live orchestra—a conductor. Also present if desired is a commentator: each broadcaster may supply their own commentary for their TV and/or radio feed, to be broadcast in each country. The commentators are given dedicated commentary booths situated {{around the back of the}} arena behind the audience.|$|E

500|$|Reznor called Year Zero a [...] "shift in direction" [...] {{in that it}} [...] "doesn't {{sound like}} With Teeth".

500|$|As Travolta did {{not attend}} to collect his trophies, an action figure of Terl, his character, {{accepted}} them in his place. Travolta responded a week later to the awards: [...] "I didn't even know there were such awards. I have people around me whose <b>job</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> not tell me about such things. They're obviously doing their job. Not every film can be a critical and box office success. It would have been awful only if Battlefield Earth was neither. That's not the case. It is edging toward the $100m mark which means it has found an audience even if it didn't impress critics. I'd rather my films connect with audiences than with critics because it gives you more longevity as a performer." [...] He later insisted that he still felt [...] "really good about it. Here I was taking big chances, breaking a new genre." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{possibility}} {{to eradicate the}} HSV-1 variant is being pursued by a team at Duke University. By {{figuring out how to}} switch all copies of the virus in the host from latency to their active stage at the same time, rather than the way the virus copies normally stagger their activity stage, leaving some dormant somewhere at all times, [...] conventional antiviral drugs might kill the entire virus population, since they can no longer hide in the nerve cells. One class of drugs called antagomir could serve this purpose. These are chemically engineered oligonucleotides or short segments of RNA that can be made to mirror their target genetic material, namely herpes microRNAs. They could be engineered to attach and thus 'silence' the microRNA, thus rendering the virus incapable of remaining latent in its host. Professor Cullen believes a drug could be developed to block the microRNA whose <b>job</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> suppress HSV-1 into latency.|$|E
2500|$|Due to a law {{dating from}} 1872, the French Republic prohibits {{performing}} census by making distinction between its citizens regarding their race or their beliefs.

2500|$|From {{the mid-1980s}} there was {{lobbying}} against gay bathhouses blaming {{them for the}} spread of STIs, in particular HIV, and this forced their closure in some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States. Sociologist Stephen O. Murray, writes that, [...] "there was never any evidence presented that going to bathhouses was a risk-factor for contracting AIDS." [...] In other countries, fears about the spread of STIs have prompted the closing of bathhouses—with their private rooms—in favour of sex clubs, in which all sexual activity {{takes place in the}} open, and can be observed by monitors whose <b>job</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> enforce safer sex practices.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the rule}} to allow QBs to simply kneel didn't take effect until 1987, Pisarcik took the snap on first down [...] and rolled {{on the ground}} (a common play for QBs in the pre-kneel era). Eagles middle linebacker Bill Bergey charged into Giants' center Jim Clack, {{knocking}} him backward into Pisarcik {{in a desperate attempt}} to force a fumble. Since defensive players usually are not blocked in this situation, they usually in turn do not rush. Offensive players consider any breach of this tacit agreement as a provocation, particularly linemen whose <b>job</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> protect the quarterback, and fights between angry linemen and the opposition were not uncommon.|$|E
2500|$|The Accidental Magic Reversal Squad is a {{squad of}} wizards whose <b>job</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> reverse [...] "accidental magic." [...] These {{accidents}} are normally caused by young witches and wizards who have not learned to control their magic. They may also be caused by older wizards out of control, or severe, unintentional effects of charms or spells, such as splinching (in Apparition when a wizard or witch is split with one part remaining {{at the point of}} origin, {{and the rest of the}} wizard at the destination). For instance, two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad were sent out in the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban book and movie when Harry Potter inflated Aunt Marge; they [...] "deflated" [...] her and erased her memory of the inflation (the memory modification done by Obliviators).|$|E

2500|$|From the show's inception, {{the idea}} of {{providing}} the latest news headlines has been critical to {{the function of the}} program. In that vein, there has always been at least one person on set whose <b>job</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> prepare and deliver newscasts. In 1952, that person was called the [...] "news editor" [...] or (informally) [...] "news chief." [...] In modern parlance, the term [...] "newsreader" [...] or [...] "news anchor" [...] is preferred. Under the two-hour format, four newscasts were delivered, once every half-hour. Presently, there are only two newscasts, delivered at the top of each of the first two hours. Some anchors, including Jim Fleming, Lew Wood, Floyd Kalber and John Palmer, were seasoned journalists before joining the program. Others, including Ann Curry, have used the position to increase their journalistic acumen, at times leaving the newsdesk behind to venture into the field.

Lenihan retained the post of Minister for Children in 2005 when the government upgraded it to a cross-departmental role allowing all those in government whose <b>job</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> look after the interests of children to work under one aegis. Although {{not a member of the}} cabinet, the Minister was allowed to attend cabinet meetings. He was involved in a proposal to outlaw domestic spanking in June 2005. On 25 October 2005, representing the government, he expressed upset at the [...] "repeated failure and gross dereliction of duties" [...] highlighted in the Ferns Report. His senior in the Department of Health and Children Mary Harney sent him in place of her to speak at an Irish Nurses Organisation conference in May 2006. He addressed a United Nations committee on children's rights in September 2006. On 16 October 2006, Lenihan announced that legislation increasing the age of criminal responsibility by five years from 7 to 12 would come into law immediately. Before leaving office in 2007 he announced several new items, including a review of pedophilia and an increase in the number of judges and other officials working with criminal children. He received criticism from a number of nurses in a disagreement over their working hours at another conference of the Irish Nurses Organisation on 10 May 2007.|$|E
