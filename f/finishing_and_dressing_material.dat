40|$|Introduction. Circumcision is {{a common}} {{procedure}} carried out around the world. Due to religious reasons, it is routinely done in Bangladesh, by both traditional as well as medically trained circumcisers. Complications include excessive bleeding, loss of foreskin, infection, and injury to the glans penis. Myiasis complicating male circumcision appears to be very rare. Case Presentation. In 2010, a 10 -year-old boy presented to the OPD of Dhaka Medical College Hospital with severe pain in his penile region following circumcision 7 -days after. The procedure {{was carried out by}} a traditional circumciser using unsterilized instruments <b>and</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>material.</b> After examination, unhealthy granulation tissue was seen and maggots started coming out from the site of infestation, indicating presence of more maggots underneath the skin. An emergency operation was carried out to remove the maggots and reconstruction was carried out at the plastic surgery department. Conclusion. There is scarcity of literature regarding complications following circumcision in developing countries. Most dangerous complications are a result of procedure carried out by traditional circumcisers who are inadequately trained. Incidence of such complications can be prevented by establishing a link between the formal and informal sections of healthcare to improve the safety of the procedure...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the incorporation of rutin into electrospun pullulan and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanofibers to obtain ultraviolet (UV) -resistant properties. The effect of weight ratios between pullulan and PVA, {{and the addition of}} rutin on the nanofibers’ morphology and diameters were studied and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis was utilized {{to investigate the}} interaction between pullulan and PVA, as well as with rutin. The results showed that the inclusion of PVA results in the increase in the fiber’s diameter. The addition of rutin had no obvious effect on the fibers’ average diameters when the content of rutin was less than 7. 41 %. FTIR results indicated that a hydrogen bond formed between pullulan and PVA, also between these polymers and rutin. Moreover, the addition of rutin could enhance the mechanical properties due to its stiff structure and could decrease the transmittance of UVA and UVB to be fewer than 5 %; meanwhile, the value of ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) reached more than 40 and 50 when the content of rutin was 4. 46 % and 5. 67 %, respectively. Therefore, the electrospun pullulan/PVA/rutin nanofibrous mats showed excellent UV resistance and have potential applications in anti-ultraviolet packaging <b>and</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

There is now {{a better understanding of}} vascular anatomy of the lower leg and better use of improved wound care technology which has led to judicial use of flaps and delayed closures.

40|$|The {{fact that}} Major Dobrzański gave his unit {{military}} character, required it {{to live under}} permanent threat, in very difficult conditions, in strict discipline and subordination, {{as well as his}} wish to avoid unnecessary conflicts, made it impossible for women to join the unit. The soldiers themselves (with some first-aid training) provided sanitary and medical care, assisted by the local population and doctors from the region. The wounded found shelter in forest cottages (dress-ing points) and at the Rectory in Ruski Bór, from where appointed persons moved them to the hospital in Opoczno. Wounded or sick soldiers were also treated, operated and looked after in the hospital in Tomaszów Mazowiecki. For a small unit operating in fairly good living conditions this could be consid-ered sufficient medical care. Constant expansion of the unit, hunger, exhaustion, absence of permanent quarters and atmosphere of constant threat brought with itself the inability to maintain personal hygiene, disinfect clothing and get rid of insects effectively, as well as to treat diseases affecting the soldiers. Absence of a decision to enlist doctors in the unit may be considered negligence on Major Hubal’s part. Good fortune as well as the determination and commitment of two nurses arriving from Warsaw, Ludmiła Żero and Genowefa Ruban, resulted in regular supplies of uniforms, medicines <b>and</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>materials,</b> as well as professional medical care nearly till the last moments of Major Hubal’s life.

To analyse {{efficacy of the}} treatment in terms of modern therapeutic standards. Materials and methods. This retrospective study {{is based on the}} medical documentation of 139 DM 1 and DM 2 patients with DFS from different medical facilities of Moscow (2007). 72 patients were given general out-patient care by surgeons of city polyclinics, 50 ones received specialized aid in the regional Diabetic Foot Cabinet. 67 patients were hospitalized: 20 for general care in the department of purulent surgery of a military hospital, 27 for specialized care in the department of purulent surgery of a city hospital, 20 for high-technology care in the endocrinological clinic of the First Moscow State Medical University. Results. Therapeutic strategy for DFS patients used in the regional Diabetic Foot Cabinet met the current therapeutic standards. General out-patient care by surgeons of city polyclinics was at variance with the algorithms adopted in this country. Pharmacoeconomic analysis of the spectrum of pharmaceutical products used for in- and out-patient treatment of DFS patients revealed frequent and ungrounded application of drugs whose wound healing effect remains to be confirmed (pentoxifylline, thioctoic and alpha-lipoic acids). Conclusion. Additional training courses for surgeons of Moscow polyclinics are needed {{to improve the quality of}} medical aid to DFS patients. Such patients must be referred to regional Diabetic Foot Cabinets. Pentoxifylline, thioctoic and alpha-lipoic acids need to be substituted by pharmaceuticals with validated therapeutic efficacy...|$|R
