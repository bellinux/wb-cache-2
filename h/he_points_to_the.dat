5|$|Because of {{the contradictions}} within Ramesside king lists {{and the lack}} of contemporary, festive inscriptions, the exact chronological {{position}} of Khaba remains disputed. Egyptologist Nabil Swelim believes that Khaba could have been the direct successor to King Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the 2nd dynasty. He bases his assumptions on similarities between the two's names: both begin with the syllable kha. As a comparison, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> names Netjerikhet (Djoser) and Sekhemkhet (Djoserteti), which also display such similarity and are widely assumed to have ruled back-to-back.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Amir's writings were published in Poedjangga Baroe, although some earlier ones were published in Timboel and Pandji Poestaka. None of his creative works are dated, {{and there is no}} consensus regarding when individual poems were written. However, there is a consensus that the works included in Nyanyi Sunyi were written after those included in Buah Rindu, despite the latter being published last. Johns writes that the poems in the collections appear to be arranged in chronological order; <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> various degrees of maturity Amir showed as his writing developed.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{presents}} a more pancultural {{view of the}} cauldron's images; he concludes that the deities and scenes portrayed on the cauldron are not specific to one culture, but many. He compares Rhiannon, whom he thinks is the figure of plate f, with Hariti, an ogress of Bactrian mythology. In addition, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> similarity between the female figure of plate B and the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, whose depictions are often accompanied by elephants. Wheel gods are also cross-cultural with deities like Taranis and Vishnu, a god from Hinduism.|$|E

25|$|Steiner then {{argues that}} inner freedom is {{achieved}} when we {{bridge the gap}} between our sensory impressions, which reflect the outer appearance of the world, and our thoughts, which give us access to the inner nature of the world. Acknowledging the many influences on our choice, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> impact of our becoming aware of just these determinants. Outer freedom is attained by permeating our deeds with moral imagination. Steiner aims to show that these two aspects of inner and outer freedom are integral to one another, and that true freedom is only achieved when they are united.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{this theory}} {{is no longer}} accepted. In 1989, Egyptologist Nabil Swelim {{examined}} the pyramid more precisely {{and found that it}} was made of small mud bricks, with a quarter of its inner core hewn out of a natural bedrock. The rock core itself contained several rock-cut tombs dating back to the 5th and 6th dynasty. Swelim and others Egyptologists, such as Toby Wilkinson, point out that it would be surprising for a royal pyramid to have been completely destroyed less than 300 years after its construction, only to be re-used for simple rock-cut tombs. Additionally, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unusual geographic position of the pyramid: Old Kingdom pyramids were commonly built on high grounds, while the pyramid Lepsius I lies on a flat plain. Thus, the datation of this monument to the late 3rd dynasty no longer seems tenable.|$|E
25|$|Socrates then broaches {{the initial}} {{question}} of whether virtue is one or many things, himself claiming that all virtue is knowledge and therefore one. He argues that the reason people act harmfully, to others or themselves, is because they only see the short term gains while ignoring the long term losses which might outweigh them, just like one makes errors in judging the size of objects that are far away. He says that if men were taught the art of calculating these things correctly, have a more exact knowledge that is, they would not act harmfully (357c–358d). Same goes for bravery. A brave swimmer is one {{who knows how to}} swim better and therefore, in a way, all virtues are essentially knowledge and can be considered one and the same, more like parts of golden objects (as discussed above) rather than the parts of a face. While Socrates seems to have won the argument, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that if all virtue is knowledge, it can in fact be taught. He draws the conclusion that to an observer he and Protagoras would seem as crazy, having argued at great lengths only to mutually exchanged positions with Socrates now believing that virtue can be taught and Protagoras that all virtues are one instead of his initial position (361a). Protagoras acknowledges Socrates a notable opponent in dispute while being much younger than he and predicts that he could become one of the wisest men alive. Socrates departs for whatever business he claimed he had when he wanted to end the dialogue earlier.|$|E

500|$|Kroyanker {{contends that}} not only did the Clal Center fail to revitalize Jaffa Road, it [...] "actually {{accelerated}} its degeneration". In particular, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lack of anchor stores, the lack of continuity of small businesses, and the cessation of activity in the stores and banks in the Clal Center in the early afternoon for making the project [...] "a typical Jerusalem commercial failure".|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{agree that}} Skin & Bone {{is as much}} about Los Angeles and the film {{industry}} as it is about prostitution or even homosexuality. [...] Writing in Bright Lights Film Journal, critic Gary Morris suggests that the film is [...] "inevitably set in Los Angeles, amid that city's arid strip malls, newsstands, and endless dusty streets" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> significance of Ghislaine's constant movement through the city, [...] "looking glamorous and inscrutable in her opaque sunglasses".|$|E
500|$|Mention by Callixenus of the [...] "forty's" [...] thranite (the {{uppermost}} rowing {{level of}} a trireme) oars leads Casson to determine that the [...] "forty" [...] had three ranks. [...] <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> practical limit of eight rowers to an oar, giving a maximum size class of [...] "twenty-four", {{as well as to}} the need for a vastly larger deck than one ship could provide in order to accommodate the reported numbers of marines. [...] Combined with Callixenus description of the ship having two heads and two sterns, Casson suggests that the [...] "forty" [...] must have been a catamaran made up of two three-ranked [...] "twenties" [...] joined together by a deck. [...] Each column or section of the ship would be composed of twenty rowers; perhaps eight rowers on each section's top rank, seven in the middle, and five on the bottom rank.|$|E

500|$|Though Whistler himself resented {{attempts}} to analyse {{the meaning of}} his art, this has not deterred later critics from doing so. The 19th-century French art critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary saw in the painting symbols of lost innocence, a theme that has been picked up by later critics. Art historian Wayne Craven also sees the painting {{as more than a}} formalist exercise, and finds [...] "enigmatic, expressive and even erotic undercurrents" [...] in the image. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contrasts presented by the imagery, with the white lily representing innocence and virginity, and the fierce animal head on the rug symbolising the loss of innocence. Beryl Schlossman, coming from the perspective of literary criticism, sees allusions to the Madonna of religious art in the work. To Schlossman, the rug under the woman's feet is the cloud on which the Virgin is often seen standing, and the bear is the serpent, crushed under her heel.|$|E
500|$|The Kylfings {{have also}} been {{identified}} with the Votic people. Carl Christian Rafn, Edgar V. Saks, B. Briem and Sigurður Nordal have proposed Kylfings {{to have been the}} Norse name for the Votes. The reason is that the ethnonym Vadja(laiset) can be associated with the word vadja (modern Estonian vai) which means [...] "stake", [...] "wedge" [...] or [...] "staff", which corresponds to Old Norse kolfr. Vadjalaiset would consequently be translated into Old East Norse as kolfingar, which in Old West Norse (Old Icelandic) would be umlauted as kylfingar. Whereas some native names were Scandinavized, as Rostov into Ráðstofa, the Norse learned of the meaning of other names and translated them, which they did at Volkhov, {{and in the case of}} some of the Dniepr rapids. The theory that the Kylfings were Votes has been opposed by Max Vasmer and Stender-Petersen, whereas Holm finds it likely. Holm considers it apparent that the Varangians and the Finnic tribes were able to cooperate well, and <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relative ease and stability with which Finland was later integrated as a part of the Swedish kingdom. Jorma Koivulehto, a Finnish linguist, disagrees with the Vote theory and maintains that the Votic name or any other Finnic ethnonym is not etymologically connected with the name Kylfingar.|$|E
2500|$|Francis has said: [...] "The Lord has {{redeemed}} all of us, all of us, ... {{even the}} atheists. Everyone! ... We are created {{children in the}} likeness of God ... {{and we all have}} a duty to do good”. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Last Judgment scene in Gospel of Matthew as proof of how God judges: what we do for the poor, the hungry, the indigent, the outcast, those who suffer and are alone, Jesus regards as done to himself (25:37-40). And <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Beatitudes as showing what gives deep happiness, what we should strive to live up to every day: being poor in spirit and meek and humble of heart, merciful and peacemakers, hungering and thirsting for righteousness.|$|E

2500|$|He [...] {{refers to}} many {{examples}} of changes now constantly going on, and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages. He instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up, and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> growth of the Nilotic delta {{since the time of}} Homer, to the shallowing of the Palus Maeotis within sixty years from his own time... He alludes... to the upheaving of one of the Eolian islands, previous to a volcanic eruption. The changes of the earth, he says, are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives, that they are overlooked; and the migrations of people after great catastrophes, and their removal to other regions, cause the event to be forgotten.|$|E
2500|$|Over time, Egyptologists {{examined}} possible {{motives and}} reasons {{as to how}} Khufu's reputation changed over time. Closer examinations of and comparisons between contemporary documents, later documents and Greek and Coptic readings reveal that Khufu's reputation changed slowly, and that the positive views about the king still prevailed during the Greek and Ptolemaic era. Alan B. Lloyd, for example, points to documents and inscriptions from the 6th dynasty listing an important town called Menat-Khufu, meaning [...] "nurse of Khufu". This town was still held in high esteem during the Middle Kingdom period. Lloyd is convinced that such a heart-warming name wouldn't have been chosen to honour a king with a bad (or, at least, questionable) reputation. Furthermore, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> overwhelming amount of places where mortuary cults for Khufu were practiced, even outside Giza. These mortuary cults were still practiced even in Saitic and Persian periods.|$|E
2500|$|Historian Dr. Yosef Meir, a noted Iraqi Zionist {{underground}} operative, {{argues in}} a rebuttal article {{that while there}} is a direct connection, the culprits are the Iraqi government or Arab nationalists. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that the bombings in question occurred after the Citizenship relinquishment act of 1950 had already expired and therefore no Jews could register for exit. He also notes that the two zionist operatives hanged were never charged with the masouda shem-tov bombing, but rather three unrelated bombings which occurred later. On the other hand, he lists the motives of the government and the pressure it exerted on [...] "Near-East" [...] (the company performing the airlifts). Yosef Meir's criticism points to circumstantial evidence that the Zionist movement had no motive while the Iraqi government and Arab nationalists did, and accuses Giladi of withholding this information on purpose, calling it [...] "an obvious attempt to mislead readers." ...|$|E

2500|$|As had Alexander, Houk and Duthie, Miller {{believes}} {{the key to}} the debate {{is to be found in}} the subplot, as it is here where the two plays differ most. He points out that the subplot in The Shrew is based on [...] "the classical style of Latin comedy with an intricate plot involving deception, often kept in motion by a comic servant." [...] The subplot in A Shrew, however, which features an extra sister and addresses the issue of marrying above and below one's class, [...] "has many elements more associated with the romantic style of comedy popular in London in the 1590s." [...] Miller cites plays such as Robert Greene's Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay and Fair Em as evidence of the popularity of such plays. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that in The Shrew, there is only eleven lines of romance between Lucentio and Bianca, but in A Shrew, there is an entire scene between Kate's two sisters and their lovers. This, he argues, is evidence of an adaptation rather than a faulty report; ...|$|E
2500|$|After this point, {{the panels}} {{deal with the}} {{response}} of the gods. The north central panel represents the continuation of the ritual in the afterlife, and shows how the events of the game connect the society of El Tajin to the gods. At the center of the scene is a temple with the rain and wind gods seated on top and a vat of liquid within. The sacrificed player appears here, whole and with a pot under his arm. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vat and addresses the rain god. The liquid is protected by a reclining chacmool, who is speaking. [...] What is being requested is pulque, indicated by a glyph indicating the mythical origin of the drink and a split image of the god of pulque above the scene. On the south central panel is depicting a scene after the sacrificed ball player has received the pulque with the same temple, glyphs and depiction of the pulque god. The differences are a depiction of the moon as a rabbit, the rain god in front of the temple and the level of the liquid in the vat lowered. The rain god is shown in a rite of auto sacrifice running a spike through part of his penis. The blood falls into the vat and to refill it with pulque.|$|E
2500|$|In a July 1972 {{issue of}} The New York Times Vincent Canby wrote {{it was not}} an [...] "especially memorable movie", that it was typical for the genre of science fiction horror, and that it failed because the rabbits, despite {{attempts}} to make them [...] "appear huge and scary, still look like Easter bunnies". In an October 1972 issue, fellow critic Roger Greenspun panned it for not [...] "even reasonably try" [...] to make the rabbits scary, its reliance on [...] "tired clichés of monsterdom", [...] "technical laziness" [...] in its special effects, [...] "stupid story", and [...] "dumb direction that leaves the film in limbo" [...] between a horror film and a fairy tale. In the Monthly Film Bulletin, Tom Milne felt Night of the Lepus had a promising beginning before moving into a [...] "well-worn horror groove", such as the effort to trap Gerry and Amanda alone in a deserted area for a last-minute rescue. Noting that the film had [...] "a certain overall charm and several striking sequences", he felt the film would have been more successful if it [...] "had the courage of its convictions – and its realism". As an example, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scene following the attack on the Calhoun ranch, in which Roy is walking into town, and tourists refuse to stop and pick him up because he has a gun. The tourists then go to the small town where the rabbits have killed everyone and are hiding in the buildings. Rather than becoming the next victims, the family call it a ghost town and leave. In the 1977 piece Dark Dreams 2.0: A Psychological History of the Modern Horror Film, Charles Derry compared it to the earlier successful works The Birds and Willard, particularly the former, noting that both featured a [...] "loveable creature". Though he felt the special effects were poor, he felt Night of the Lepus successfully tied into ongoing fears of throwing ecology out of balance, with the rabbits serving as an appropriate metaphor for human fears about overpopulation.|$|E
