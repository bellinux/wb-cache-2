Romney's television advertisements {{in the early}} primary states prominently featured her [...] and by the close of 2007, {{she was the most}} visible of all the Republican candidates' wives in campaigning. [...] Regarding having to witness criticism of her husband, she later acknowledged that she sometimes wanted to [...] "come out of my seat and clock somebody [...] you learn to <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> deep breath."

On July 13, 1985, he {{appeared at the}} climax at the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia. Backed by Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, he performed a ragged version of [...] "Hollis Brown", his ballad of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people: [...] "I hope {{that some of the}} money... maybe they can <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> little bit of it, maybe... one or two million, maybe... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks." [...] His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but they did inspire Willie Nelson to organize a series of events, Farm Aid, to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.|$|E

2500|$|During the break, bass guitarist and {{producer}} Chris Taylor released a solo album, Dreams Come True (2011), under the pseudonym CANT, stating, [...] "I can't <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> break. For whatever reason, I'm {{the kind of}} person who needs to constantly to work on stuff. When we finished touring, I didn't want to take some time off, I just wanted to go into the studio. But, I really didn't want to book myself in with a band and go record them, so I decided I'd try and make my own record." [...] Daniel Rossen recorded and released a solo EP, Silent Hour/Golden Mile (2012), featuring tracks initially intended for Shields.|$|E

2500|$|Game Informer {{said that}} the game [...] "doesn't <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> step {{backwards}} from the first game – it performs a reverse swan dive off a balcony into a swimming pool filled with razorblades" [...] (a possible reference to [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic's song [...] "One More Minute"). Anthony Gallegos of IGN gave the game a very negative review. He felt the new combat system was actually worse than its predecessors. He reasoned the quick-time events rob the game of any suspense and disrupt the horror atmosphere, which he also criticized separately. Gallegos felt the game was poorly designed and disliked the difficult puzzles.|$|E

In a Rolling Stone (Australia) interview, Julia revealed the duo had started recording tracks for a third album, in January 2011, but shelved them indefinitely: [...] "It {{was too much to}} think we could only pick six songs each… We were both in a place where we really wanted creative space to go in whatever direction we wanted so we were like 'let’s <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> year out'". She elaborated that those songs were unlikely to be heard, but maintained the pair would reunite after their solo projects.|$|E
