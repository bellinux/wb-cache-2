The story {{takes place in}} the aftermath of the earthquake in Los Angeles in 1994.|$|E
500|$|I {{would say}} it was a directorial {{collaborative}} effort. We went to the rainforest and that was interesting. Part of the reason was [...] I love Puerto Rico one of my favorite places ever and I did one of my favorite videos, 'Honey', in Puerto Rico at the El Conquistador hotel. I was involved every step of the way... I like a lot of the shots in the video... There was a moment where I had to do an additional water sequence with no director, just myself and a camera man with an underwater camera. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> take at 5 in the morning, [...] ready to kill me. But if we didn't have those shots there wouldn't be anything to cut away to, except me.|$|E
500|$|In contrast, Australia batted with {{apparent}} ease, as the overcast skies {{cleared and}} sun came out. The debutant Watkins sent down four overs for 19 runs with his bruised shoulder {{and did not}} bowl again. He was in much pain and his limp bowling did little to trouble the Australian openers. Morris and Barnes batted comfortably and passed England's first innings total by themselves, taking {{less than an hour}} to push the Australians into the lead. O'Reilly felt the Australian openers wanted to prove [...] "the pitch itself had nothing whatever to do with the English batting debacle". Australia reached 100 at 17:30 with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The only chance came when Barnes powerfully square cut Bedser low to point, where Young spilled the catch. When Young came on to bowl, his finger spin was expected to trouble the batsmen on a rain-affected surface, but he delivered little variation in pace and trajectory and Barnes in particular hit him repeatedly through the off side field. The score had reached 117 after only 126 minutes, when Barnes was caught behind from Hollies for 61. The right-handed Australian opener stumbled forward to a fast-turning leg break that caught his outside edge. He had overbalanced and would have been stumped if he had failed to make contact with the leather. This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 18:00, late on the first day. As Bradman had already announced the tour would be his last at international level, the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat; Yardley led the Englishmen and the crowd in giving his Australian counterpart three cheers, before shaking Bradman's hand. With 6,996 Test career runs, Bradman needed only four runs to average exactly 100 in Test cricket. Bradman took guard and played the first ball from Hollies, a leg break, from the back foot. The leg spinner pitched the next ball up, bowling Bradman for a duck with a googly that went between bat and pad as the Australian skipper leaned forward. Bradman appeared stunned by what had happened and slowly turned around and walked back to the pavilion, receiving another large round of applause. It was claimed by many, including Hollies, that Bradman became emotional and had tears in his eyes at the ovation given to him by the crowd and the English players, and that this hampered his ability to see and hit the ball. Bradman admitted to being moved by the applause, but always denied shedding tears, saying [...] "to suggest I got out, as some people did, because I had tears in my eyes while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bowler was quite untrue. Eric Hollies deceived me and he deserves full credit." ...|$|E

Then, when I realized the ball was in play, I pulled my hands back… The guys played a great game. The focus shouldn't be on this.” [...] During the game, Mack Brown was furious with the penalty call and insisted that Jessee did not touch the ball. [...] After the game Brown said that Jessee stepping onto the field [...] " [...] how bad our family wanted to win the game".|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{preparation}} she did for the film, actor Aishwarya Rai {{said in an interview}} that both herself and the director Bhansali [...] ".. just like to walk randomly around the sets and [...] "feel". Sometimes I sit quietly and gaze into space or the ground and he captures all that. In fact, the poster picture with me looking away was taken like that. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ground, lost in deep thought and he clicked it and told me that he was putting it on his poster. He knows when I am ready to do a scene, when I am in character, and the like. For instance, I delayed going on the set by two days and he did not say anything. He called me on the set and said we would start shooting in five days. On the second day, I tried hair, make-up, and costume. He told me I was ready to give my first shot and indeed, I was." [...] About the script Bhansali said that he had worked on the script for 18 months and says, [...] "My film is mainstream in terms of budgets, cast and audience and I had to make sure that I did not hurt anyone but evoked a debate." [...] He points out that without star-clout, such themes will not make any impact on the audience or society. [...] "And at least till my screenplay reaches the interval point, I do not start casting my actors." ...|$|E

6000|$|He opened it, {{and read}} it through.

60|$|But I was not {{thinking}} of her. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl.

6000|$|... "Well, no; I can't {{say that}} I do," [...] he {{returned}} thoughtfully, {{without seeming to}} have noticed her withdrawal.

60|$|There {{the subject}} dropped. We were {{silent for a}} while. She <b>was</b> thinking, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her. On a sudden, she raised her head. Her eyes rested on me gravely.|$|R
