40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of EC State aid rules, focusing on recent Commission policy and recent judgments of the Court of Justice on State aids. In Part I, some general points, such as what may constitute a State aid, are considered. In Part II, the procedural aspects are dealt with in more detail, with emphasis on the notification process, and the procedure for reviewing State aids. Part III examines the recovery of <b>illegally</b> <b>granted</b> <b>aids,</b> and the defenses a beneficiary may assert. Next, Part IV sets out the remedies available for breach of the State aid rules, including the right to contest the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s decisions. The article concludes by pointing out the shortcomings of the present procedures and suggesting changes that could improve the procedures, especially from the perspective of outside investors unfamiliar with the EC rules...|$|R

40|$|We use {{regression}} discontinuity and regression kink {{designs to}} estimate the impact of need-based <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> on the borrowing and educational attainment {{of students enrolled in}} a large public university system. Pell <b>Grant</b> <b>aid</b> substantially reduces borrowing: among students who would borrow {{in the absence of a}} Pell Grant, every dollar of Pell <b>Grant</b> <b>aid</b> crowds-out over $ 1. 80 of loans. A simple model illustrates that our findings are consistent with students facing a fixed cost of incurring debt. The presence of such a fixed cost may lead to the unintended consequence of additional <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> decreasing some students’ attainment. Empirically, we rule out all but modest average impacts of Pell <b>Grant</b> <b>aid</b> on attainment, and we provide suggestive evidence of heterogeneous effects consistent with our fixed-borrowing-cost model. We estimate an augmented Tobit model with random censoring thresholds to allow for heterogeneous fixed borrowing costs, and find that eliminating the fixed cost would increase borrowing by over 250 percent...|$|R

40|$|The paper explores {{a number}} of long {{standing}} questions surrounding how foreign aid has influenced the fiscal behaviour of the PNG Government. This includes whether <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> has encouraged the PNG government to be less fiscally responsible and accumulate higher levels of foreign debt; whether <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> has tended to lower the PNG government's domestic revenue raising efforts; whether <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> has drawn government expenditures away from key service delivery sectors; and whether budget support and project and program aid have had differential effects with respect {{to any of the}} foregoing questions. The analysis reveals several important insights regarding the interplay between foreign aid and public sector fiscal behaviour including evidence that <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> has been an important source of debt reduction during this period. However, <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> has tended to erode the domestic tax base, which has limited the government's ability to increase aggregate expenditure levels. Evidence is also found that suggests a significant portion of budget support was spent on key development sectors, although it also undermined domestic revenue collection.

40|$|Foreign aid to {{the island}} economies is a major source for foreign {{exchange}} and resource needs. This paper presents an empirical analysis {{of the relationship between}} foreign aid and economic growth in the case of Fiji. A neoclassical production function is applied to estimate the aid-growth nexus. Since the data employed are time series for the period 1968 to 1996, the Autoregressive Distributed Lag approach to cointegration is utilized to estimate the models. Components of total <b>aid,</b> such as <b>grant</b> <b>aid,</b> loan aid, technical cooperation, bilateral and multilateral aid flows are also utilized to estimate a disaggregated short-run and long-run relationship between foreign aid and economic growth. The results show that total aid flows and its various forms, i. e. bilateral <b>aid,</b> <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> and technical cooperation <b>grant</b> <b>aid,</b> has a significant impact on economic growth in Fiji. As for domestic resources, only exports and private investments in two equations show positive contribution to growth. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an initial investigation into the expenditure responses of a group of local authorities in England to a loss in grant income. The Government has restricted <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> to local authorities in an attempt to secure restraint in the expenditure of these authorities, but (until recently) local authorities {{have had the opportunity to}} make good any loss in grant income by increasing local taxes. A central issue is, then, how much restraint in local authority expenditure is secured by a given reduction in <b>grant</b> <b>aid.</b> Reduction in <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> is measured in this paper in terms of its impact on the local tax rate (and the average local domestic tax bill) if a local authority is to maintain the real value of its spending. An incremental budgeting type model is developed and the empirical work is concerned with the financial years 1982 - 1983 and 1984 - 1985. It is found that in the later year local authorities have been less willing to reduce their expenditure in the face of loss of <b>grant</b> <b>aid.</b> It is also found that the response of the local authorities has become more political in the sense that a statistically significant difference has developed between the responses of Labour and those of non-Labour controlled councils. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine how}} donor {{government}} ideology influences {{the composition of}} foreign aid flows. We use data for 23 OECD countries over the period 1960 - 2009 and distinguish between multilateral and bilateral <b>aid,</b> <b>grants</b> and loans, recipient characteristics such as income and political institutions, tied and untied aid, and aid by sector. The results show that leftist governments increased the growth of bilateral <b>grant</b> <b>aid,</b> and more specifically <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> to least developed and lower middle 8 ̆ 1]income countries. Our findings confirm partisan politics hypotheses because grants are closely analogous to domestic social welfare transfer payments, and poverty and inequality are of greatest concern for less developed recipient countries...|$|R

40|$|Agroforestry has {{not been}} adopted in the UK despite the {{potential}} it has to diversify output while reducing the opportunity cost of lost agricultural production. In part this reflects the limited nature of the <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> available. This article demonstrates that the current pro rata restriction that <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> is paid {{in proportion to the}} number of stems planted means that annual incomes derived from silvoarable or silvopastoral systems compare poorly with those from agricultural enterprises alone. By facilitating a greater variety in the spatial arrangement of trees, agroforestry systems offer a potential diversity of landscape forms and wildlife habitats that are not available from conventional plantation forestry. The article argues that this contribution to environmental diversity should be reflected in the level of <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> provided for agroforestry. Silvopastoral systems based on sheep are shown to offer the greatest potential, and proposals are made for encouraging the development of such systems...|$|R
