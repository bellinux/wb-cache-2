On August 13, 1848 the United States Congress created the Oregon Territory {{out of the}} land between California and the 49th {{parallel}} (this served as the border with Britain's North American colonies) and west of the Rocky Mountains. A new bicameral territorial legislature was created with an upper chamber Council and lower chamber House. These bodies {{met for the first}} time on July 16, 1849, with some members of the provisional legislature continuing into the new government, including David Hill, Asa Lovejoy, Samuel Parker, and Absalom J. Hembree. Upon statehood in 1859, the territorial legislature would be transformed into the Oregon Legislative Assembly.|$|E

50|$|Lying about 80 km {{northwest}} of Bintulu, Malaysia on the Continental shelf of Borneo, the shoal is 80 km from the Malaysian coast and about 1800 km from the Chinese mainland.

25|$|Imia/Kardak was {{the object}} of a {{military}} crisis and subsequent <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> <b>sovereignty</b> between Greece and Turkey in 1996. The Imia/Kardak dispute is part of the larger Aegean dispute, which also comprises disputes over the continental shelf, the territorial waters, the air space, the Flight Information Regions (FIR) and the demilitarization of the Aegean islands. In the aftermath of the Imia/Kardak crisis, the dispute was also widened, as Turkey began to lay parallel claims to a larger number of other islets in the Aegean. These islands, some of them inhabited, are regarded as indisputably Greek by Greece but as grey zones of undetermined sovereignty by Turkey.|$|E
25|$|War is a {{state of}} {{organized}} armed conflict between states or non-state actors. War is characterized by the use of lethal violence against others—whether between combatants or upon non-combatants—to achieve military goals through force. Lesser, often spontaneous conflicts, such as brawls, riots, revolts, and melees, are not considered to be warfare. Revolutions can be nonviolent or an organized and armed revolution which denotes a state of war. During the 20th century, it is estimated that between 167 and 188 million people {{died as a result of}} war. A common definition defines war as a series of military campaigns between at least two opposing sides involving a <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> territory, resources, religion, or other issues. A war between internal elements of a state is a civil war. Among animals, all-out war against fellow members of the same species occurs only among large societies of humans and ants.|$|E

50|$|When the Europeans {{discovered}} the New World {{in the fifteenth}} century, the land that was new to them had been home to Native Peoples for thousands of years. The American colonial government determined a precedent of establishing the land sovereignty of North America through treaties between sovereigns. This precedent was upheld by the United States government. As a result, most Native American land was purchased by the United States government, a portion of which was designated to remain under Native sovereignty. The United States government and Native Peoples do not always agree on how land should be governed, which {{has resulted in a}} series of <b>disputes</b> <b>over</b> <b>sovereignty.</b>|$|R

50|$|Finally, it {{is argued}} that there is in fact no {{principle}} in International Law or UN doctrine that can displace the inalienable right to self-determination.

50|$|Borgholz {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in 1291 in two documents, both confirming {{that there was}} a Borcholte at this time. It has to thank for its founding - as does the main town - a <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> <b>sovereignty</b> in the area between the Archbishops of Cologne and the Bishops of Paderborn in the 13th century.

50|$|The {{cause of}} the war was a <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> the <b>sovereignty</b> of the widely {{separated}} Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh border regions.

25|$|There remains some {{uncertainty}} over the earliest mention of Zubarah in written documents. Qatar's Memorial, a 1986 Arabic history book, alleges that a functional self-governing town existed {{before the arrival}} of the Utub. It supported this claim by invoking two purported historical documents, but they were later discovered to be forgeries produced by Qatar in an attempt to gain leverage over Bahrain in their long-standing <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> the <b>sovereignty</b> of the town.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{holds that}} China's {{national}} security during its peaceful rise {{is a new}} issue on the research agenda, which requires new counter-measures and collective wisdom. The paper discusses five of China's objectives in addressing national security; namely, from highest to lowest priority, friction among big powers, the Taiwan issue, <b>disputes</b> <b>over</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> protection of interests overseas, and undertaking international responsibilities. Systematically achieving these objectives is of major importance for building up national defence and China's international image. China's state security {{in the current period}} of peaceful development is a new issue on the research agendum, for politicians, the military, scholars and researchers alike. Extensive and in-depth discussion is needed. Global security commitments made by a big power might conflict with its own security interests and objectives. Judging by any standard, China's tasks are heavy and the road ahead is long.

50|$|The {{abortive}} Kellogg-Alfaro Treaty {{involved the}} two countries in a critical incident with the League of Nations. During the fall of 1927, the League Assembly insisted that Panama could not legally participate in the proposed arrangement with the United States. The assembly argued that an automatic declaration of war would violate Panama's obligations under the League Covenant to wait three months for an arbitral decision on any dispute before resorting to war. The discussion was largely academic inasmuch as the treaty had already been effectively rejected, but Panama proposed that the <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> <b>sovereignty</b> in the Canal Zone be submitted to international arbitration. The United States denied that any issue needed arbitration.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the signing}} of the 1997 Australia-Indonesia Maritime Delimitation Treaty, most grey areas between the two countries, whose {{relations}} have at various stages ranged from cordial to downright hostile, concerning their common maritime boundary could be deemed to have been settled. This includes not only the question of <b>sovereignty</b> <b>over</b> the seabed but also the ownership of resources inhabiting the water column above the seabed. The earlier <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> the <b>sovereignty</b> of the seabed in the area known as the [...] "Timor Gap" [...] also ended with the secession and independence of East Timor.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> the <b>sovereignty</b> of Shebaa Farms {{resulted}} {{in part from}} the failure of the French Mandate administrations, and subsequently the Lebanese and Syrian governments, to demarcate the border between Lebanon and Syria.

One French official in 1939 declared that the uncertainty was sure to cause trouble in the future.|$|R
