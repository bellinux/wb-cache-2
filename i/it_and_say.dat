500|$|Critics {{agreed that}} this album {{represents}} a more [...] "mature" [...] Blink-182, hence {{the absence of}} songs with toilet humour or jokes for which the band had been known. [...] "We wanted to be different," [...] remarked DeLonge. [...] "Some of our fans were probably like, 'Fuck, maybe they should stop joking so people could hear why I like this band.' And I think this record {{is going to help}} those kids out.". In an interview with MTV Album Launch, Hoppus said that the desired effect of the album was for people to listen to <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Wait a minute...that's Blink-182?" [...] The themes for the album include growing up and dealing with the realities of adulthood including relationship woes, daily pressures, and unexpected hardships.|$|E
500|$|However, Harrington dismisses this as [...] "a younger critic's evaluation.

[...] Specifically in response to the [...] "majesty and power" [...] reading, Harrington states [...] "My opinion is that's just pure bullshit. That's a critical interpretation {{that has nothing to do}} with the original inspiration."

[...] "Caesar Barrand Hull, of the crinkly hair and the croaky voice, the laughing warrior whose idea of a lark was to change seats in the air... who had a phobia about worms or slugs, who would look under the bed 'in case there are any feenies about', then kneel beside <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> his prayers." [...] Bolitho took a similar line in his 1943 book Combat Report, attesting to Hull's [...] "bubbling, unquenchable gaiety". According to Bolitho, Hull was [...] "possessed of a magic power of creating happiness in others; making them belittle their cares, of inspiring them with confidence, not simply in him but in themselves. Of imbuing them with his own abounding love of life. Where Caesar was, laughter was." ...|$|E

500|$|In the song, Michael Stipe {{sings the}} lines [...] "That's {{me in the}} corner/That's me in the spotlight/Losing my religion". The phrase [...] "losing my religion" [...] is an {{expression}} from the southern region of the United States that means losing one's temper or civility, or [...] "being {{at the end of}} one's rope." [...] Stipe told The New York Times the song was about romantic expression. He told Q that [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] is about [...] "someone who pines for someone else. It's unrequited love, what have you." [...] Stipe compared the song's theme to [...] "Every Breath You Take" [...] by The Police, saying, [...] "It's just a classic obsession pop song. I've always felt the best kinds of songs are the ones where anybody can listen to it, put themselves in <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'Yeah, that's me.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Filmmaker Curtis Harrington, {{a friend}} and confidant of Whale's, {{dismissed}} this as [...] "a younger critic's evaluation.

500|$|Cuse {{served as}} show runner and head writer. Boam, {{who served as}} {{executive}} producer, also contributed scripts for the show. The writing staff included John Wirth, Brad Kern, Tom Chehak, David Simkins, and John McNamara. They followed Cuse's informal instruction that {{the tone of the}} show remain [...] "just under over-the-top": the series would be humorous but not too campy. Every member of the staff participated in breaking down and analyzing the stories they conceived. Worth commented, [...] "there was a very high percentage of ideas that worked in the room and got translated to paper that worked when you put them on film. That doesn't always happen." [...] Cuse described long hours writing the show, including several overnight sessions. Each episode of Brisco was filmed in seven days, so the turn-around time for scripts was one week. McNamara said that he became a [...] "student of TV history" [...] while writing for Brisco, reviewing old episodes of Maverick for inspiration on using humor in the Western genre. He said the writing team felt the television audience was ready for a [...] "trans-genre form", because much of the audience grew up with Lethal Weapon, , and The Wild Wild West. Researchers Lynnette Porter and Barry Porter acknowledge the writer's familiarity with Mark Twain's novel Pudd'nhead Wilson. Porter and Porter describe the novel as an [...] "ancestor text", because the characters of Brisco and Bly both refer to <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> that this type of literary device is used again by Cuse in Lost.|$|E

2500|$|Jones {{was also}} {{famous for his}} {{peculiar}} skill with the train whistle. His whistle was made of six thin tubes bound together, the shortest being half {{the length of the}} longest. Its unique sound involved a long-drawn-out note that began softly, rose and then died away to a whisper, a sound that became his trademark. The sound of it was variously described as [...] "a sort of whippoorwill call," [...] or [...] "like the war cry of a Viking."

2500|$|... "Orinoco Flow" [...] was {{the final}} track written for the album, {{but it was one}} that Enya {{recalled}} was difficult to work on, which involved several breaks from recording before coming back to it several weeks after. She later pointed out the absence of deadlines to complete the album, as granted in her contract with Warner, which allowed the song to be developed {{over a period of time}} until [...] "we were able at the end to listen to <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> 'this is good'". It originated from a riff she had developed after Nicky suggested to play a melody in five different octaves; they left the arrangement as it was, until they realised the album needed one more track. The song developed around the initial riff, itself becoming part of the chorus hook. An earlier version of the song contained no middle eight and had the line [...] "Sail away..." [...] after every line which Dickens later said, [...] "drove me crazy", but recognised its potential if it was worked on. Its pizzicato introduction, which has been compared to Andy Williams' 1963 single [...] "Can't Get Used to Losing You", was the genesis of Roma's inspiration for the song's lyrics after she had heard the introduction as she looked out of the studio window and saw her children skipping. Dickins and Cullum are referenced in the lyrics in the lines: [...] "We can steer, we can near with Rob Dickins at the wheel. We can sigh, say goodbye, Ross and his dependencies", the latter being a reference to the region of Antarctica known as Ross Dependency. Dickins only found out about it after the album had been pressed which embarrassed him at first and initially wanted it changed, but soon warmed to it after the single went to number one. [...] "All these years later", he said, [...] "if I hear that line ... I can't help smiling." ...|$|E
