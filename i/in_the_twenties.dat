5|$|Sainsbury batting scores {{dipped in}} county cricket during 1879; in nine {{appearances}} for Somerset during the year, his highest score was 39. He performed {{better with the}} ball, twice taking four wickets during an innings, against both Bedfordshire and the MCC. The following county season began more positively for Sainsbury, as he collected nine wickets in the match against Sussex at Lansdown's ground in Bath, claiming six wickets for 54runs in the second innings of the game. He claimed another eight wickets when Somerset travelled to Leicestershire, during which Sainsbury and Arnold Fothergill took five wickets each in Leicestershire's first innings, restricting the home side to 51runs. Somerset won the low-scoring contest by 85runs, Sainsbury having scored a valuable 28 during his side's first innings. Somerset's visit to Sussex saw Sainsbury continue his success against the county, {{this time with the}} bat rather than the ball. Sussex built on their 63 run first innings lead with a second innings total of 183, leaving Somerset the task of scoring 247 runs to win the match. Sainsbury scored his second century for Somerset, remaining 101 not out when Somerset reached the winning total. He was assisted by a half-century from Stephen Newton, and scores <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>twenties</b> by Bill Fowler and Frederick Smith. Later that month, his batting was once again instrumental in setting up a Somerset victory, when he top-scored with 87 as Somerset beat the MCC by an innings.|$|E

25|$|NAC Breda’s longest-running and deepest rivalry is {{with their}} nearest neighbour, Willem II from Tilburg, colloquially known as Stillem II (English: Quietness II). This rivalry {{originated}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>twenties</b> of the 20th century. Matches {{between the two}} {{are referred to as}} the derby of Brabant. The two cities of Breda and Tilburg are just 20 kilometres apart, leading to an intense feeling of a cross-town rivalry, heightened by a feeling that it is city against city with local pride at stake.|$|E
25|$|The Manstein Plan {{is often}} seen as either the result of or {{the cause of a}} mid-20th century Revolution in {{military}} affairs. In the former hypothesis, expounded by Fuller and Basil Liddell Hart immediately after the events, the Manstein Plan is presented as a natural outcome of the evolution of German military thinking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>twenties</b> and thirties by Hans von Seeckt and Guderian, adopting the ideas of Fuller or Liddell Hart. If true, an explicit Blitzkrieg doctrine would have been established by 1939 and been the basis of the plan for the Invasion of Poland; the Manstein Plan would have been its most spectacular implementation. The doctrine would have been reflected in the organisation and equipment of the army and the Luftwaffe and would have been radically different from those of France, Britain and the Soviet Union, except for the contributions of individuals like Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Charles de Gaulle, Fuller and Liddell Hart. That the earliest plans by Halder or Manstein and the final plan by Halder did not conform to this doctrine is an anomaly, to be explained by circumstances.|$|E
25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>twenties,</b> held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E

25|$|The {{first years}} weren’t that well for NAC, but when NAC {{moved to a}} new stadium ‘t Ploegske the results improved. NAC became one of the topteams in the highest Southern Division. In 1919 NAC became {{champion}} of this competition and was allowed to play the Dutch Champions’ Competition (a small competition in which the champions from the regional divisions would play for the Dutch title). During this competition NAC finished in the last place. In 1920, NAC {{was one of the first}} clubs to play international matches. NAC played a couple of friendly matches, including a match against Real Madrid CF. NAC won this match with 0–4 and the Spanish newspapers called NAC ‘Los muchacos del Breda, maestros del futbol’ (English: The boys from Breda, masters in football). In 1921, NAC celebrated one of its greatest achievements, when they became Dutch football champion. In the Dutch Championship competition, NAC defeated Ajax, Be Quick 1887 and Go Ahead. NAC continued to play soccer on a high level and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>twenties</b> and thirties NAC was considered to be one of the best clubs in Dutch football. During this period NAC won 6 Southern Division titles and the football was deemed technically perfect by press and public.|$|E
25|$|Having {{played for}} the Nottinghamshire Second XI since 1981, Evans made his {{first-class}} debut for Nottinghamshire against Cambridge University in 1984 at Trent Bridge. He played two further first-class matches in his debut season against the touring Sri Lankans and West Indians, as well as making his List A debut against Middlesex in the 1984 John Player Special League. First-class and List A appearances were {{few and far between}} for Evans between 1984 and 1987, but he eventually broke into the Nottinghamshire side on a regular basis in the 1988 season. An all-rounder, Evans was able to provide valuable runs down the batting order, though he had mixed seasons and struggles with consistency. His most successful season with the bat in first-class cricket came in 1990 when he scored 738 runs at an average of 46.12, including making his maiden century against Somerset, which followed on from a duck he had made earlier in the match. His batting average mostly stuck around <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>twenties</b> and he only had an average higher than thirty in three seasons. It was a similar story with the ball for Evans in his first-class career, with him not taking a five wicket haul until the 1991 season. Typically, his bowling average season-to-season fluctuated in the late twenties to mid-thirties. He took 40 wickets or more in a season on three occasions, with the 1997 season being his most successful with 45 wickets at an average of 28.37 (though he did take 48 wickets in 1992, but at a higher average), which included his career best figures of 6/40 which came against Lancashire. Evans played a total of 161 first-class matches for Nottinghamshire between 1984 and 1999, scoring 4,198 runs at an average of 23.85, with a high score of 104, one of three centuries along with 21 half centuries he made. An able fielder, he also took 111 catches. Evans along with West Indian Jimmy Adams holds the record for the 9th wicket for Nottinghamshire with a partnership of 170. With the ball, he took 364 wickets at an average of 33.23, with best figures of 6/40, one of ten five wicket hauls he took.|$|E

500|$|Hananu's {{leadership}} of the revolt gained him wide popularity in Syria. Referring to Hananu, Khoury wrote [...] "No name was more familiar to children growing up in Syria <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>twenties</b> and thirties; stories of his heroics were standard bedtime fare." [...] In Ba'athist historiography, Hananu became a hero of the Syrian Arab nationalist movement. The Hananu Revolt {{was a turning point}} in Aleppo's relationship with the Arab nationalist movement. Under the influence of Hananu, his Arab Club, and other Aleppine leaders with similar politics, the Muslim elite of Aleppo gradually embraced Arab nationalism. Hananu later became {{a founding member of the}} National Bloc in 1928, which according to Syrian historian Sami Moubayed, was [...] "created out of the defeat of the armed revolts of the 1920s". The National Bloc advocated diplomatic means to combat French rule and was the principal opposition movement against the French authorities until Syria's independence in 1946. Hananu served as the za'im (chief) of the movement until his death in 1935.|$|E
500|$|Somerset were {{stripped}} of their first-class status for three reasons: they had not organised and played enough first-class fixtures during the season, their performances were not what was expected from a first-class county, and they had not succeeded in fielding a full side of eleven players in all their matches. An emergency meeting was held in Taunton, during which a new club secretary was appointed, rules were altered, and wealthy benefactors were sought. Despite these widespread changes, Sainsbury retained the club captaincy. In Somerset's first match of 1886, Sainsbury hit his highest score for the county in almost three years, scoring 90 out of a Somerset total of 241. The bowling of Arnold Fothergill helped to restrict their opponents, Warwickshire, in the second innings; but faced with requiring 150 in their second innings for victory, Somerset were bowled out for 58. Throughout 1886, Sainsbury's batting continued to be more fruitful than his efforts in {{the previous two years}} of first-class cricket, and he regularly made scores <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>twenties</b> and thirties. He hit 94 from the middle order against the MCC in mid-August, his highest score of the season. Toward the end of the 1886 season the arrival of Sammy Woods and George Nichols vastly improved the quality of the bowling for the county, but 1887 was nevertheless marked by a slow start. A victory over Essex, in which Sainsbury scored 71, was bracketed by heavy losses to Warwickshire and Gloucestershire. Against Hampshire, Sainsbury reached his highest total for Somerset, scoring 164 {{out of a total of}} 315, to help his side on their way to a six-wicket victory. A big win over Warwickshire followed, and the county was said to be [...] "a ship heading out for an ocean of prosperity".|$|E
