25|$|Decrease of hemoglobin, with {{or without}} an {{absolute}} decrease of red blood cells, leads to symptoms of anemia. Anemia has many different causes, although iron deficiency and its resultant iron deficiency anemia {{are the most common}} causes in the Western world. As absence of iron decreases heme synthesis, red blood cells in iron deficiency anemia are <b>hypochromic</b> (lacking the red hemoglobin pigment) and microcytic (smaller than normal). Other anemias are rarer. In hemolysis (accelerated breakdown of red blood cells), associated jaundice is caused by the hemoglobin metabolite bilirubin, and the circulating hemoglobin can cause renal failure.|$|E

5000|$|In microcytic anaemia, the {{red blood}} cells (erythrocytes) are usually also <b>hypochromic,</b> meaning that the {{red blood cells}} appear paler than usual. This is {{reflected}} by a lower-than-normal mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), a measure representing the amount of hemoglobin per unit volume of fluid inside the cell; normally about 320-360 g/L or 32-36 g/dL. Typically, therefore, anemia of this category is described as [...] "microcytic, <b>hypochromic</b> anaemia".|$|E
5000|$|Microcytic <b>hypochromic</b> anaemia: iron {{deficiency}} {{caused by the}} loss of ferritin (compound used to store iron in the body). It is iron-therapy resistant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypochromic</b> anemia {{occurs in}} {{patients}} with <b>hypochromic</b> microcytic anemia with iron overload. The condition is autosomal recessive and is caused by mutations in the SLC11A2 gene. The condition prevents red blood cells from accessing iron in the blood, which causes anemia that is apparent at birth. It can lead to pallor, fatigue, and slow growth. The iron overload aspect of the disorder means that the iron accumulates in the liver and can cause liver impairment in adolescence or early adulthood.|$|E
50|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} in the medical literature in 1911. Symptoms include megalocephaly, external ear deformities, dental caries, micromelia, hypoplastic bone deformities, hypogonadism, <b>hypochromic</b> anemia with occasional tumors, and mental retardation.|$|E

50|$|In 1841, Popper {{published}} {{a treatment for}} Chlorosis (<b>Hypochromic</b> anemia) containing Vitriolum martis (sulfuric acid and iron) and Sal tartari (potassium carbonate) in Österreichische medicinische Wochenschrift which was re{{published a}}nd refined in the following years.|$|E
50|$|Benjamin Syndrome (or Benjamin anemia) {{is a type}} of {{multiple}} congenital anomaly/intellectual disability (MCA/MR) syndrome. It is characterized by <b>hypochromic</b> anemia with mental deficiency and various craniofacial and other anomalies. It can also include heart murmur, dental caries and splenic tumors.|$|E
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of delta-beta thalassemia is done via <b>hypochromic</b> microcytic red cell indices. This test {{is a part}} of a CBC, and could be employed to diagnose the reason the individual might have anemia, in this case due to thalassemia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypochromic</b> anemia was {{historically}} {{known as}} chlorosis or green sickness for the distinct skin tinge sometimes present in patients, {{in addition to}} more general symptoms such {{as a lack of}} energy, shortness of breath, dyspepsia, headaches, a capricious or scanty appetite and amenorrhea.|$|E
50|$|In 1936, Arthur J. Patek and Clark W. Heath of Harvard Medical School {{concluded}} that chlorosis was identical to <b>hypochromic</b> anemia. More recently, {{some people have}} suggested {{that it may have}} been endometriosis, but the historical descriptions cannot easily be mapped on to this condition.|$|E
5000|$|The mean corpuscular {{hemoglobin}} (MCH), or [...] "mean cell hemoglobin" [...] (MCH), is {{the average}} mass of hemoglobin per red blood cell {{in a sample of}} blood. It is reported as part of a standard complete blood count. MCH value is diminished in <b>hypochromic</b> anemias.|$|E
50|$|Ferrous {{gluconate}} {{is effectively}} {{used in the}} treatment of <b>hypochromic</b> anemia. The use of this compound compared with other iron preparations results in satisfactory reticulocyte responses, a high percentage utilization of iron, and daily increase in hemoglobin that a normal level occurs in a reasonably short time.|$|E
50|$|Microcytic anemia is {{primarily}} a result of hemoglobin synthesis failure/insufficiency, which could be caused by several etiologies:Iron deficiency anemia {{is the most common}} type of anemia overall and it has many causes. RBCs often appear <b>hypochromic</b> (paler than usual) and microcytic (smaller than usual) when viewed with a microscope.|$|E
50|$|The {{blood smear}} {{of a person}} with iron {{deficiency}} shows many <b>hypochromic</b> (pale and relatively colorless) and rather small RBCs, and may also show poikilocytosis (variation in shape) and anisocytosis (variation in size). With more severe iron-deficiency anemia, the peripheral blood smear may show <b>hypochromic</b> pencil-shaped cells, and occasionally small numbers of nucleated red blood cells. Very commonly, the platelet count is slightly above the high limit of normal in iron deficiency anemia (this is mild thrombocytosis). This effect was classically postulated {{to be due to}} high erythropoietin levels in the body as a result of anemia, cross-reacting to activate thrombopoietin receptors in the precursor cells that make platelets; however, this process has not been corroborated. Such slightly increased platelet counts present no danger, but remain valuable as an indicator even if their origin is not yet known.|$|E
50|$|The {{parasite}} also causes coagulopathies. Haematomas {{and prolonged}} bleeding {{are as a}} result of thrombocytopaenia (where clotting factors are decreased due to them binding to antigen - antibody complexes). Clotting factors V and VIII are also reduced. <b>Hypochromic</b> anaemia is another symptom, also used in diagnosis and is due to the parasite interfering with haemoglobin synthesis.|$|E
50|$|Eye color, {{specifically}} {{the color of}} the irises, is determined primarily by the concentration and distribution of melanin. The affected eye may be hyperpigmented (hyperchromic) or hypopigmented (<b>hypochromic).</b> In humans, usually, an excess of melanin indicates hyperplasia of the iris tissues, whereas a lack of melanin indicates hypoplasia. The term is from ancient Greek: ἕτερος, héteros meaning different and χρώμα, chróma meaning color.|$|E
50|$|As OPRTase {{is part of}} a bi{{function}}al complex UMP synthase in humans, {{the function}} and stability of this enzyme is not necessarily directly associated with disorders in the human body. It is however reasonable to believe that a dysfunction in one of the enzymes will cause a dysfunction of the whole enzyme.Defects in UMP synthase is associated with <b>hypochromic</b> anemia.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hypochromic</b> anemia is {{a generic}} term for {{any type of}} anemia in which the red blood cells (erythrocytes) are paler than normal. (Hypo- refers to less, and chromic means color.) A normal red blood cell will have an area of pallor {{in the center of}} it; it is biconcave disk shaped. In <b>hypochromic</b> cells, this area of central pallor is increased. This {{decrease}} in redness is due to a disproportionate reduction of red cell hemoglobin (the pigment that imparts the red color) in proportion to the volume of the cell. Clinically the color can be evaluated by the Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) or Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC). The MCHC is considered the better parameter of the two as it adjusts for effect the size of the cell has on its color. [...] Hypochromia is clinically defined as below the normal MHC reference range of 27-33 picograms/cell in adults or below the normal MCHC reference range of 33-36 g/dL in adults.|$|E
50|$|Elevations in target {{cells are}} the result of a shift in the {{exchange}} equilibrium between the red blood cells and the cholesterol. Also the surface membrane to volume ratio is increased. Target cells are more resistant to osmotic lysis, which is mostly seen in dogs. <b>Hypochromic</b> cells in iron deficiency anemias also can show a target appearance. Target cells are abnormally resistant to saline.|$|E
5000|$|Infected pups {{may present}} with pale mucus {{membranes}} and anemia, ill thrift, failure to gain weight, poor hair coat, dehydration, and dark, tarry diarrhea (melena). Puppies harboring many worms will develop an acute normocytic, normochromic anemia followed by <b>hypochromic,</b> microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency. Without immediate intervention, these animals may die of the infection. Those that survive may continue as [...] "poor doers" [...] with chronic anemia.|$|E
5000|$|Red {{blood cells}} can be characterised by their {{haemoglobin}} content {{as well as}} by their size. The haemoglobin content {{is referred to as the}} cell's colour. Therefore, there are both [...] "normochromic microcytotic red cells" [...] and [...] "hypochromic, microcytotic red cells". The normochromic cells have a normal concentration of haemoglobin, and are therefore 'red enough' while the <b>hypochromic</b> cells do not; thus the value of the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration.|$|E
5000|$|Koilonychia (from the Greek: koilos-, hollow, onikh-, nail), {{also known}} as spoon nails, is a nail disease {{that can be a}} sign of <b>hypochromic</b> anemia, {{especially}} iron-deficiency anemia. [...] " [...] It refers to abnormally thin nails (usually of the hand) which have lost their convexity, becoming flat or even concave in shape. In a sense, koilonychia is the opposite of nail clubbing. In early stages nails may be brittle and chip or breakeasily.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypochromic</b> anemia may {{be caused}} by vitamin B6 {{deficiency}} from a low iron intake, diminished iron absorption, or excessive iron loss. It can also be caused by infections (e.g. hookworms) or other diseases (i.e. anemia of chronic disease), therapeutic drugs, copper toxicity, and lead poisoning. One acquired form of anemia is also known as Faber's syndrome. It may also occur from severe stomach or intestinal bleeding caused by ulcers or medications such as aspirin or bleeding from hemorrhoids.|$|E
50|$|When adult worms {{attach to}} the villi of the small intestine, they suck on the host's blood, which may cause {{abdominal}} pain, diarrhea, cramps, and weight loss {{that can lead to}} anorexia. Heavy infections can lead to the development of iron deficiency and <b>hypochromic</b> microcytic anemia. This form of anemia in children can give rise to physical and mental retardation. Infection caused by cutaneous larvae migrans, a skin disease in humans, is characterized by skin ruptures and severe itching.|$|E
50|$|Fuchs heterochromic {{iridocyclitis}} - {{a condition}} {{characterized by a}} low grade, asymptomatic uveitis in which the iris in the affected eye becomes <b>hypochromic</b> and has a washed-out, somewhat moth eaten appearance. The heterochromia can be very subtle, especially in patients with lighter colored irides. It is often most easily seen in daylight. The prevalence of heterochromia associated with Fuchs has been estimated in various studies with results suggesting {{that there is more}} difficulty recognizing iris color changes in dark-eyed individuals.|$|E
50|$|Atransferrinemia, {{also called}} {{familial}} hypotransferrinemia, is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder {{in which there}} is an absence of transferrin, a plasma protein that transports iron through the blood.Atransferrinemia is characterized by anemia and hemosiderosis in the heart and liver. The iron damage to the heart can lead to heart failure. The anemia is typically microcytic and <b>hypochromic</b> (the red blood cells are abnormally small and pale). Atransferrinemia was first described in 1961 and is extremely rare, with only ten documented cases worldwide.|$|E
50|$|PVS sufferers often {{complain}} of a burning sensation with the tongue and oral mucosa, and atrophy of lingual papillae produces a smooth, shiny, red, dorsum of the tongue. Symptoms include:Serial contrasted gastrointestinal radiography or upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may reveal the web in the esophagus. Blood tests show a <b>hypochromic</b> microcytic anemia {{that is consistent}} with an iron-deficiency anemia. Biopsy of involved mucosa typically reveals epithelial atrophy (shrinking) and varying amounts of submucosal chronic inflammation. Epithelial atypia or dysplasia may be present.|$|E
50|$|Hephaestin has not {{yet been}} linked to a human disease. However, when the protein was ablated in murine models, both intestine-specific and whole-body hephaestin {{knockout}} (KO) strains exhibited similarly severe accumulation of iron in the duodenal enterocytes and suffered from microcytic, <b>hypochromic</b> anemia, indicative of systemic iron deficiency. The shared phenotype between the two strains suggests that intestinal hephaestin {{plays an important role in}} maintaining whole-body iron homeostasis. However, since both strains were viable, it is likely that hephaestin is not essential and other compensatory mechanisms exist to keep these mice alive.|$|E
50|$|Decrease of hemoglobin, with {{or without}} an {{absolute}} decrease of red blood cells, leads to symptoms of anemia.

50|$|The first {{official}} published {{description of the}} disease {{was made by the}} Bulgarian nephrologist Dr.Yoto Tanchev (1917 - 2000) and his team in 1956 in the Bulgarian Journal Savremenna Medizina, a priority generally acknowledged by the international nephrological community. Their study was based on a wide screening of inhabitants of the villages around the town of Vratsa, Bulgaria. Their contribution to the understanding of this unusual endemic disease of the kidneys was their description of symptoms which were not typical of common chronic nephritis, i.e., incidence only in adults (no children affected), absence of high blood pressure, xanthochromia of palms and soles (Tanchev's sign), early <b>hypochromic</b> anemia, absence of proteinuria, and slow progression of kidney failure.|$|E
5000|$|Cameron lesions {{are usually}} found in {{older adults with}} anemia {{symptoms}} such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and appearing pale. Blood tests in iron deficiency show low hemoglobin, microcytic <b>hypochromic</b> red cells, and low iron-binding saturation and ferritin levels. The lesions are visualized by esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Sometimes the lesions are found when endoscopy is done for other hernia symptoms than anemia such as heartburn, regurgitation, swallowing difficulty, pain or distention. [...] When a person with iron deficiency anemia is {{found to have a}} large hernia and Cameron lesions on endoscopy, this usually explains the blood loss. A lower gastrointestinal bleeding site such as colon cancer may be excluded by colonscopy. and other tests as clinically indicated.|$|E
5000|$|Iron {{deficiency}} anemia is classically a microcytic, <b>hypochromic</b> anemia.

[...] A 2015 Cochrane Collaboration review found that daily oral supplementation of iron during pregnancy reduces the risk of maternal anaemia and that effects on infant and on other maternal outcomes are not clear. Another review found that [...] "intermittent regimens (of oral iron supplementation) produced similar maternal and infant outcomes as daily supplementation but were associated with fewer side effects". The quality of evidence was poor, though.|$|E
