5|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> {{identified}} Bostic {{even before}} the shooting occurred, he would have faced a two-year prison sentence for violating the terms of his parole, since he was out past his curfew. After the shooting, police discovered the BMW had been stolen from the Five Towns Mitsubishi car dealership in Inwood, Long Island, where Bostic worked as a salesman. A motor vehicle theft or gun possession conviction would have been Bostic's third felony, likely resulting in a lengthy prison sentence.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 2011, Bristol East MP Kerry McCarthy {{gave her}} {{support to the}} idea of a public DNA {{screening}} process <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> found it useful. The Avon and Somerset Constabulary had conducted mass DNA screening during the 1995 investigation into the disappearance of Louise Smith. McCarthy suggested that the screening process should be extended beyond Clifton to the wider Bristol area. DNA that had been found on Yeates' body was tested for a potential profile. Detectives also began tracking the movements of several hundred registered sex offenders living within their jurisdiction to determine the individuals' whereabouts on 17 December.|$|E
5|$|After {{a horrible}} night, Quagmire {{approaches}} Lois about talking to Brenda about leaving Jeff. At lunch, Lois and Brenda begin {{talking about the}} situation, and requests that Brenda remove her sunglasses, revealing a bruise over her eye. Upon seeing this, Lois tries to convince Brenda to leave Jeff, but Brenda only makes excuses for Jeff's treatment of her, much to Lois' disapproval. Later, at the bar, Peter, Quagmire and Joe discuss the matter, asking <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> can solve the situation. Joe then suggests that the group have an intervention with Brenda, where Quagmire confesses that the sister he knew growing up no longer exists, and he wants her back. The two then embrace each other by hugging, until Jeff enters the intervention, causing an enraged Quagmire {{to tell him that}} Brenda has agreed to leave him. Pressured by Jeff, Brenda reveals that the two are engaged, and that she is pregnant.|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{legislative changes}} in the UK regarding the reclassification of cannabis from a Class B to C drug. This report discusses how cannabis reclassification was put into practice, the impact of <b>the</b> reclassification on <b>police</b> resources and their views about the change. The report concludes that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>policing</b> of cannabis possession is {{to be seen as}} equitable and fair and the justice system to be seen as transparent, then policing needs to be non-discriminatory, monitored adequately and evaluated critically at regular intervals...|$|R
5000|$|A {{person is}} [...] "seized" [...] for {{purposes}} of the Fourth Amendment when physical force or a show of authority terminates or restrains his freedom of movement. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>police's</b> intent to restrain an individual is unclear, or if an individual's submission to a show of authority {{takes the form of}} passive acquiescence, a seizure does not occur unless a reasonable person would not feel free to leave in light of all <b>the</b> circumstances. <b>If,</b> however, <b>the</b> person has no desire to leave for reasons unrelated to the traffic stop, there is no seizure.|$|R
50|$|Whilst a {{child is}} subject to <b>police</b> protection, <b>the</b> {{designated}} officer {{has a duty to}} review the case regularly for the full period the child is under <b>police</b> protection; even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> child has been accommodated elsewhere. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> designated <b>police</b> officer changes during this period, this must be endorsed on <b>the</b> <b>police</b> protection form.|$|R
5|$|If {{an offense}} is filed, the issue may be {{investigated}} by police on duty. Permission for {{search and seizure}} is issued by the police prosecutor on duty at the police district. Apprehended people are permitted a free defense counsel at the public's expense. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> wish to keep apprehended people in detention, the issue is brought to the relevant district court, a process which may be repeated several times if the custody needs to be extended. Investigations are led by a police prosecutor. During investigation, {{the case may be}} concluded as a non-criminal offense, dismissed, or transferred to another police district. Minor cases with a positive finding may be resolved by police penalty notice, settlement by a conflict resolution board and withdrawal of prosecution.|$|E
5|$|Later on {{the evening}} of 7 August, she asked Bamber whether he had done it. He said no, but that a friend of his had, whom he named; the man was a plumber the family had used in the past. Bamber {{allegedly}} said he had told this friend how he could enter and leave the farmhouse undetected, and that one of his instructions had been for the friend to telephone him from the farm on one of the phones in the house that had a memory redial facility, so that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> checked it, it would give him an alibi. Everything had gone as planned, he said, except that Nevill had put up a fight, and the friend had become angry and shot him seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Bamber said. The friend then placed the Bible on her chest so she appeared to have killed herself in a religious frenzy. The children were shot in their sleep, he said. Mugford said Bamber claimed to have paid the friend £2,000.|$|E

25|$|The {{mother of}} the Imun-dong murder victim rushed at Yoo with an {{umbrella}} when he {{was brought to the}} Prosecutor's office later in July, screaming that her daughter would still be alive <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> had captured him earlier.

25|$|The {{surveillance}} operation {{resulted in}} extensive video footage that reportedly covered the whole six weeks except {{the night of}} the raid on the hotel itself.

25|$|However, {{he never}} did. Farrakhan and newly elected congressman Charles Rangel, {{who had come}} to the scene, warned them that the crowd outside, already {{throwing}} rocks, assaulting reporters present and attempting to damage police property, was beyond their control. Seedman claimed they offered to have the mosque worshippers show up at the local precinct house <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> left the scene; Rangel has said that he could not make such a promise, and did not.|$|E
50|$|In February 2008, Mel became WPC Morton, joining {{her friend}} Abi Sharpe in <b>the</b> <b>police</b> force where she began {{training}} {{to become a}} full-time <b>Police</b> Constable.

25|$|On 4 October, counter-protesters wearing blue ribbons {{marched in}} support of the police. Patrick Ko of the Voice of Loving Hong Kong group accused the suffragists of having double standards, and said that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> had {{enforced}} the law, protesters would have already been evicted. The anti-Occupy group Caring Hong Kong Power staged their own rally, at which they announced their support for the use of fire-arms by police and the deployment of the People's Liberation Army.|$|E
25|$|The Central Labor Council, the Building Trades Council and the Teamsters Joint Council {{approached}} Mike Johannes, the Minneapolis Chief of Police, {{to propose}} a truce, under which the local would cease picketing for twenty-four hours <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> and the employers ceased trying to move trucks. The employers, the Teamsters and the building trades signed a formal truce agreement. Johannes, however, declared that the police would move trucks once the truce expired, leading the union to announce that it was resuming picketing.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} more victims than those who have applied for and been granted {{certification}}. First, certification requires that the victim be willing to cooperate with a police investigation. Following a police raid, some victims {{just want to go}} home, some victims don’t want to cooperate with police and are deported, and some victims are afraid to testify against vicious traffickers. The application for certification requires support from law enforcement. If the victim is not seen as useful for a case, or <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> don't want to pursue a case, they have no support to stay in the U.S. and will not be counted as victims of trafficking.|$|E

25|$|Around 1954, {{parties were}} held at Florance's house, {{referred}} to as 'The Hovel'. According to Peter Oyston: over those years my sister and I worked out that we had 82 callers a week, not counting those who came more than once. It was constant open house. My stepfather would start a party with his muso friends while my mother was at the theatre. And then my mother would bring back the cast and any {{people who came to}} see the shows. And the taxi drivers and, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> called to quieten us up, then the police would be invited in and they'd join the party too. It really was an extraordinary time.|$|E
25|$|Any {{police officer}} may, without warrant, arrest and detain pending {{enquiries}} any person {{in respect of}} whom he has reason to believe there are grounds which would justify the person's detention. In the 1960 case of Re Ong Yew Teck, the High Court held that since a police officer ordering an arrest {{is not required to}} disclose facts which he considers to be against the public interest to disclose, it is futile for a court to objectively decide whether there are grounds justifying detention. Therefore, a subjective test is to be applied – <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> officer honestly supposes he has reason to believe the required element, the court cannot go behind the officer's statement. However, Ong Yew Teck may no longer be good law in view of the Court of Appeal's more recent decision in Kamal Jit Singh (above).|$|E
25|$|For {{a moment}} it looked as <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> would manage to push home their attack, {{but some of the}} squatters were armed with tear-gas grenades and threw three of them into the shop. The police were {{carrying}} gas masks but it was impossible to don them without breaking their shield wall and thus exposing themselves to the incoming stones. The police attack broke. Fifteen officers were injured, and another 20-30 had to be taken to hospital to have their eyes flushed because of the tear gas. After this, the police gave up trying to storm the barricades. The order was given that nobody was to try to enter the area. The police now focused on keeping the squatters inside the barricaded area. The police commanders feared that the squatters would try to expand the barricades to cut several main roads around the house.|$|E
50|$|Provincial chief firearm {{officers}} (CFOs) {{may only}} issue an authorization {{in accordance with}} the regulations.

As such, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> relevant <b>police</b> agency determines its protection is sufficient, the CFO would have difficulty in issuing <b>the</b> ATC over <b>police</b> objections.|$|R

5000|$|As is {{provided}} by law, strikes by military police officers are illegal. A decision by the Court of Justice of Espírito Santo on February 6 determined {{the end of the}} strike and a daily fine of R$100,000 <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Military <b>Police</b> refuses to comply with the order. The situation became more extreme when Humberto Mileip, vice president of <b>the</b> state Civil <b>Police</b> Union, said that after <b>the</b> Military <b>Police's</b> strike, <b>the</b> Civil <b>Police</b> would go on strike. [...] "Our salary is one of the lowest in Brazil. In recent years, there has been no compensation for inflation", Mileip said.|$|R
500|$|If a party gives {{consent to}} a search, a warrant is not required. There are {{exceptions}} and complications to the rule, including {{the scope of}} the consent given, whether the consent is voluntarily given, and whether an individual has the right to consent to a search of another's property. [...] In Schneckloth v. Bustamonte (1973), the Court ruled that a consent search is still valid even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> do not inform a suspect of his right to refuse the search. This contrasts with Fifth Amendment rights, which cannot be relinquished without an explicit Miranda warning from police.|$|E
500|$|Jefferies {{has since}} given {{his account of}} what happened, and {{revealed}} to the press in 2014 the mental strain the investigation had on his life for over two months. Jefferies said: [...] "At the time it felt as <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> were deliberately playing a game - promising the ordeal would soon be over and then finding it necessary to prolong the wait. It {{was a form of}} psychological torture. At such times the mind plays tricks, and one starts to believe that perhaps one is a criminal without knowing it and that, as in some Kafkaesque nightmare, guilt has been pre-ordained and the sentence is inescapable." ...|$|E
500|$|Marx was {{considering}} an academic career, but this path was barred by the government's growing opposition to classical liberalism and the Young Hegelians. Marx moved to Cologne in 1842, {{where he became}} a journalist, writing for the radical newspaper Rheinische Zeitung (Rhineland News), expressing his early views on socialism and his developing interest in economics. Marx criticised both right-wing European governments as well as figures in the liberal and socialist movements whom he thought ineffective or counter-productive. The newspaper {{attracted the attention of}} the Prussian government censors, who checked every issue for seditious material before printing, as Marx lamented: [...] "Our newspaper has to be presented to the police to be sniffed at, and <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> nose smells anything un-Christian or un-Prussian, the newspaper is not allowed to appear". After the Rheinische Zeitung published an article strongly criticising the Russian monarchy, Tsar Nicholas I requested it be banned and Prussia's government complied in 1843.|$|E
