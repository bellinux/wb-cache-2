We show that entanglement oscillations can occur for both amplitude and phase damping noises. Moreover, we demonstrate that changing the coupling bandwidth can lead to crossover between dissipative and non-dissipative entanglement dynamics, while varying the <b>detuning</b> <b>controls</b> the crossover between strong and weak coupling limits.

Automated compensation of Lorentz force detuning of FLASH and European X-FEL resonators allowed to maintain cavities in resonance operation even for high acceleration gradients (in range of 30 MV/m). It should be emphasized that cavity resonance control consists of two independent subsystems. First of all the slow motor tuner based system {{can be used for}} slow, wide range mechanical tuning (range of hundreds of kHz). Additionally the piezo tuning system allows for fine, dynamic compensation in a range of ~ 1 kHz.

In combination, these two control parameters allow for a systematical adjustment of the regimes of nonlinear dynamics, which leads to an alteration of the pattern of pulse trains. Changing the resonator length on a sub-wavelength scale enables manipulation of the feedback phase, which can be used to adjust shape and bandwidth of the optical spectrum.

50|$|Features include four voltage-controlled {{oscillators}} (VCOs) with tuning, footage (16, 8, 4, 2), waveshape (triangle, saw, pulse-width, and pulse-width modulated), and amplitude. The first oscillator is {{the master}} oscillator as far as fine tuning goes. Two direct modifiers to the VCOs are a <b>detune</b> <b>control</b> that only affects oscillators 2 and 4, and a Pulse Width control that goes to cancellation either side of 50% phase symmetry of a square wave; pulse width can be routed to MG1, MG2, or voltage-controlled filter (VCF) envelope. There is one independent noise generator with an amplitude control (frequency and shape is modified by the VCF). There is one 24/db octave exponential low-pass VCF with resonance, scaling and invertible envelope control shared across all four VCOs. One voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA) envelope with triggering and dampering controls is shared across all four VCOs. There are two low frequency modulators: MG1 controls VCO Pitch/Pulse-width, 'EFFECTS' and VCF cutoff; MG2 controls the tempo of the arpeggiator, and Pulse-Width. There is one arpeggiator with on/off/latch control, up/down/up-down pitch control, and 1/2/full keyboard control (44 notes). The arpeggiator can cycle through each oscillator in POLY mode, or all four {{at a time in}} MONO. There is an 'EFFECTS' section which includes an amplitude modulator (X-MOD) with hard-sync control, and a frequency modulator with which the frequency of the modulator can be altered by the VCF envelope or MG1. For both modulators there is the option of single modulation of all oscillators, or two carriers, and two modulators (using the VCOs). Controller Interfaces are external inputs/outputs for CV/Trigger, VCF and VCO mod inputs, arpeggiator, portamento, and the pitch/MG1 mod wheels can be assigned to control VCO1 pitch, pitch or the filter. Bender goes to 2.5 octaves +/- for Pitch and full range for VCF cutoff. There are 5 different oscillator assignment modes: 'Hold' drones the oscillators until force dampered or Chord Memory is activated; 'Chord Memory (MONO)' allows 2-4 oscillators (VCOs) to be set to any arrangement across 44 keys (for example, in organ or rave chords); 'Unison (MONO)' stacks all 4 oscillators; and 'Unison/Share', which defaults to Unison with one note played, but divides the oscillators across the notes as 2 or more are played.

Three groups {{of male and female}} subjects were randomly assigned; the chiropractic group, mobilisation group and <b>detuned</b> ultrasound (<b>control</b> group). Each group consisted of 10 subjects, aged between 18 to 35 with equal numbers of males and females. All subjects were mentally and physically healthy, and were instructed to refrain from nicotine and caffeine intake at least one hour prior to the experiment, as these substances are stimulants and may influence the results.

40|$|The spin of {{a single}} hole, {{confined}} to a QD has been proposed as a solid-state qubit that can be manipulated on an ultrafast timescale. QD heavy holes {{are known to have}} a weaker hyperfine interaction with atomic nuclei than electrons [1]. A single hole may therefore be a more robust qubit since the nuclear spins are the main source of dephasing. In this talk, we present experimental results that demonstrate the complete control {{of a single}} hole spin state [2]. Related experiments have been published in [3, 4]. The hole spin is initialized via fast (10 - 100 ps) ionization of a spin-polarized electron-hole pair in an InAs/GaAs QD. Spin rotations about two orthogonal axes are then combined to give the final spin state of the hole: Larmor precession about a Voigt-geometry magnetic field and rotation about the optical axis due to a control laser pulse. Measurements are made with a photocurrent technique. A Geometric phase approach is used, as proposed in ref [5]. A circularly polarized, resonant 2 π pulse drives a Rabi rotation between the polarization-selected hole-spin and trion state, after which the hole-spin is rotated about the z-axis by an angle Δφz. Fig 1 (b, d) show experiments to control the phase and amplitude of the Larmor precession, confirming that the control pulse has the desired effect. <b>Detuning</b> the <b>control</b> pulse gives a dependence that closely matches theoretical predictions. In conclusion, we demonstrate that precession of the hole-spin, combined with the optical rotations by the control pulse can be used to perform rotations of up to π about two axes. The gate time for the optical rotation is determined by the 14 ps FWHM of the pulse, much faster than the measured coherence time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – For {{induction}} motor drives {{controlled by the}} indirect rotor flux oriented control (IRFOC), the rotor resistance variation results in an undesirable coupling between the flux and the torque of the machine, and loss of dynamic performance. This paper presents a scheme for the estimation of rotor resistance using a neural networks (NN) block. In this system the flux and torque have been estimated by using stator voltages and currents. A back-propagation NN receives the flux and torque errors and a supposed rotor resistance at the input and estimates the actual rotor resistance at the output, which {{is used in the}} control of an indirect vector-controlled drive system. The neural network has been trained off line with the mathematical model of the <b>control</b> scheme in <b>detuning</b> operations. IRFOC <b>control,</b> used with the NN estimator, has been studied in the detuning condition. The performance of the controller is good, even when the rotor time constant is increased from nominal rate to twice the nominal value, as well as torque variations.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the use of}} coherent optical fields {{as a means of}} dynamically controlling the resonant behaviour of a variety of composite metamaterials, wherein the metamaterial structures are embedded in a dispersive dielectric medium. Control and switching is implemented by coherently driving the resonant permittivity of the embedding medium by applied optical radiation. The effect of embedding Split ring resonators (SRR) in a frequency- dispersive medium with Lorentz-like dispersion or with dispersion engineered by electromagnetic induced transparency (EIT), is manifested in the splitting of the negative permeability band, the modified (frequency-dependent) filling fractions and dissipation factors. The modified material parameters are strongly linked to the resonant frequencies of the medium, while for an embedding medium exhibiting EIT, also to the strength and <b>detuning</b> of the <b>control</b> field. The robustness of control against the deleterious influence of dissipation associated with the metallic structures as well as the inhomogeneous broadening due to structural imperfections is demonstrated. Studies on plasmonic metamaterials that consist of metallic nanorods arranged in loops and exhibit a collective magnetic response at optical frequencies are presented. Control and switching in this class of plasmonic nanorod metamaterials is shown to be possible, for example, by embedding these arrays in a Raman active liquid like CS$_ 2 $ and utilizing the Inverse Raman Effect.

This thesis deals with the modeling and control of induction machine under indirect vector control with parameter estimation in order to get better field oriented performance.

A complete model of the inverter and the machine is developed to assist the approach. Hysteresis and space vector modulation switching schemes have been compared.

40|$|This {{technical}} memorandum presents {{studies on}} velocity feedback control with an electrodynamic proof-mass actuator. It is {{demonstrated that the}} stability and performance of the control unit can be substantially improved by implementing an appropriate open-loop compensation filter. In the simulations the control unit is {{described in terms of}} the open and closed-loop base impedance it presents to the structure under control. This allows for a straight-forward physical interpretation of the control system and allows a direct derivation of the expression for the proposed compensator. Studies on the sensitivity of the compensation to uncertainties in the actuator parameters show that even for considerable variations in the actuator response the compensation filter provides significant improvement over the uncompensated cases. The enhanced control stability which results from a <b>detuning</b> of the <b>control</b> actuator passive mechanical and active electromechanical response allows tuning the control unit mechanical resonance such that actuator acts as a passive vibration absorber, a configuration that would lead to poor control stability if direct uncompensated velocity feedback is applied. One draw back of the compensator is the enhancement of the feedback signal at low frequencies. This may lead to stroke/force saturation of the actuator before the optimal control gain can be implemented. This can be addressed by implementing an additional high-pass filter in the feedback loop, which attenuates the low frequency feedback signal and suppresses measurement noise. However, this has to be balanced with a loss in the control stability due to the additional phase-lead that is introduce. Experimental studies were conducted to validate the simulated control performances and it is demonstrate that the proposed compensator can be used in the design of small scale self contained multifunctional feedback control units. <br/...|$|R

Not only the volume standard manufacture in silicon foundry is promising to low-lost optical components operating at IR and mid-IR range, {{it also provides}} a robust platform for revealing new physical phenomenon. The thesis starts from comparison between photonic crystal and micro-ring resonators based on chip routers, showing photonic crystal switches have small footprint, consume low operation power, but its higher linear loss may require extra energy for signal amplification. Different designs are employed in their implementation in optical signal routing on chip. The second part of chapter 2 reviews the graphene based optoelectronic devices, such as modulators, lasers, switches and detectors, potential for group IV optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEIC). In chapter 3, the highly efficient thermal optic control could act as on-chip switches and (transmittance) tunable filters. Local temperature tuning compensates the wavelength differences between two resonances, and separate electrode is used for fine tuning of optical pathways between two resonators. In frequency domain, the two cavity system also serves as an optical analogue of Autler-Towns splitting, where the cavity-cavity resonance <b>detuning</b> is <b>controlled</b> by the length of pathway (phase) between them. The high thermal sensitivity of cavity resonance also effectively reflects the heat distribution around the nanoheaters, and thus derives the thermal conductivity in the planar porous suspended silicon membrane. Chapter 4 and 5 analyze graphene-silicon photonic crystal cavities with high Q and small mode volume. With negligible nonlinear response to the milliwatt laser excitation, the monolithic silicon PhC turns into highly nonlinear after transferring the single layer graphene with microwatt excitation, reflected by giant two photon absorption induced optical bistability, low power dynamic switching and regenerative oscillation, and coherent four-wave-mixing from high Kerr coefficient. The single layer graphene lowers the operational power 20 times without enhancing the linear propagation loss.

40|$|An {{electronic}} system adjusts {{the frequency of}} a tunable laser, eventually locking the frequency to a peak in the optical absorption spectrum of a gas (or of a Fabry-Perot cavity that has an absorption peak {{like that of a}} gas). This system was developed to enable precise locking of the frequency of a laser used in differential absorption LIDAR measurements of trace atmospheric gases. This system also has great commercial potential as a prototype of means for precise control of frequencies of lasers in future dense wavelength-division-multiplexing optical communications systems. The operation of this system is completely automatic: Unlike in the operation of some prior laser-frequency-locking systems, there is ordinarily no need for a human operator to adjust the frequency manually to an initial value close enough to the peak to enable automatic locking to take over. Instead, this system also automatically performs the initial adjustment. The system (see Figure 1) is based on a concept of (1) initially modulating the laser frequency to sweep it through a spectral range that includes the desired absorption peak, (2) determining the derivative of the absorption peak with respect to the laser frequency for use as an error signal, (3) identifying the desired frequency [at the very top (which is also the middle) of the peak] as the frequency where the derivative goes to zero, and (4) thereafter keeping the frequency within a locking range and adjusting the frequency as needed to keep the derivative (the error signal) {{as close as possible to}} zero. More specifically, the system utilizes the fact that in addition to a zero crossing at the top of the absorption peak, the error signal also closely approximates a straight line in the vicinity of the zero crossing (see Figure 2). This vicinity is the locking range because the linearity of the error signal in this range makes it useful as a source of feedback for a proportional + integral + derivative control scheme that constantly adjusts the frequency in an effort to drive the error to zero. When the laser frequency deviates from the midpeak value but remains within the locking range, the magnitude and sign of the error signal indicate the amount of <b>detuning</b> and the <b>control</b> circuitry adjusts the frequency by what it estimates to be the negative of this amount in an effort to bring the error to zero...|$|R
