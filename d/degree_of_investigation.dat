With respect to Islamic stock market indexes, this concern is more pertinent {{to the extent that}} indexes could be subject to manipulation, and because they are often used as a benchmark for Islamic mutual funds. Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model as our basis, we place the most popular Islamic index under analytical scrutiny, and ask (1) how has the Sharia selection restriction affected its performance? (2) what is the competitive risk-return tradeoff of a Sharia compliant index and (3) to what extent is a Sharia compliant index correlated with the broad stock market. Our results reveal that the most popular index is market competitive but has underperformed in relation to another morally restricted but non-Islamic index. We conclude that investors in the Muslim index are not suffering a discernible cost for complying to the Sharia restriction.

These students are both of Chinese descent, with parents who migrated from Hong Kong to Canada at different times. The first {{case study is}} a language learning kit designed by a student born in Canada and whose parents migrated in the 1970 s.

The second case study is a research and book design project on design elements of Chinese restaurants in North America. This student, who migrated with her parents in the 1980 s, has a better command of Chinese.

Because a seller generally {{will not be}} able to transfer statutory responsibility for environmental problems, it is advisable for the seller to investigate and remedy environmental problems prior to transferring the property. An environmental investigation may be required for the seller to make representations and warranties to buyers and lenders.

(2) Uncertainty of the nature, extent, and corrective action must be limited to an acceptable level of risk.

The purpose of the investigation will be to document and verify the adequacy of existing information; to affirm the decision for either clean closure, closure in place, or no further action; and to provide sufficient data to implement the corrective action. The actual corrective action selected will be based on characterization activities implemented under this SAFER Plan.

The results demonstrated that around 30 % of the sample displayed mild or worse levels of internet addiction, as measured by the IAT. Although there were differences in the purposes for which males and females used the internet, there were no differences in terms of levels of problematic usage between genders. The internet problems were strongly related to all of the other psychological variables such as depression, anxiety, social-isolation, and sleep problems. Internet addiction was also associated with reduced self-reported immune function, but not with the measure of general health (GHQ- 28). This relationship between problematic {{internet use}} and reduced immune function was found to be independent {{of the impact of the}} co-morbidities.

40|$|Monocot {{residues}} such as corn stover {{and straw}} {{are often not}} fully exploited and constitute a potential substrate for bioethanol production. However, {{a number of factors}} such as high enzyme loadings make large-scale utilization economically difficult. Addition of non-ionic surfactants and poly(ethylene glycol) to enzymatic hydrolysis of various lignocellulosic substrates has been found to increase the conversion of cellulose into soluble, fermentable sugars. We have shown that surfactants are able to increase cellulose conversion with up to 70 %. This provides an opportunity of decreasing enzyme loading while retaining the same <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> hydrolysis. <b>Investigations</b> <b>of</b> five wheat straw substrates produced with different pretreatment methods revealed that surfactants have a more pronounced effect on acid and steam treated straw than, e. g. ammonia and hydrogen peroxide treated straw. Thus, lignin content is not directly proportional with the potential surfactant effect. Studies of adsorption of cellulases support the theory that the main mechanism behind the surfactant effect is prevention of unspecific adsorption of enzyme on the substrate lignin. This is believed to be due to hydrophobic interaction between lignin and the surfactant, causing steric repulsion of enzyme from the lignin surface. More research is needed to reveal which factors influence enzyme and surfactant adsorption. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
