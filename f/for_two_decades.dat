5|$|Burnell was a {{dominant}} figure {{during the first}} part of Edward's reign, and he controlled most aspects of royal administration. He was involved not only in domestic issues but also in foreign relations, a responsibility he retained <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> after Edward's return to England in 1274. Huscroft argues that he may have been the most important royal administrator of the 13th century.|$|E

5|$|Most {{scientists}} {{of the day}} recoiled to find that Cope's feud with Marsh had become front-page news.

5|$|In 1052, Domnall's {{aforesaid}} grandfather {{conquered the}} Kingdom of Dublin from Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles (died 1064/1065), {{and soon after}} appointed Murchad as King of Dublin. About a decade later, Murchad appears to have driven Echmarcach from Mann, after which he gained the kingship of the Isles. Diarmait's deep-rooted authority in Norse-Gaelic Dublin lasted <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades,</b> and was a remarkable achievement that no other Irish king had ever accomplished. Unfortunately for the Uí Chennselaig, two of Diarmait's sonsMurchad and Glún Iairnunexpectedly predeceased their father in 1070, and Diarmait himself fell in battle two years later.|$|E
5|$|In July 1986, Peterson {{offered a}} free flattop haircut {{to anyone who}} {{attended}} the opening of his third store at 82nd and Foster. Peterson, who got his first flattop haircut in 1952, hired three barbers to give haircuts {{on the floor of}} his showrooms. They gave about 50 haircuts the first day, and Peterson decided to make the gimmick a weekly event. He continued offering the haircuts <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> and as of 2002 was still giving away about ten haircuts per week.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the days}} of the stage road {{avalanches}} and rockfalls often forced closures of the highway, partly due to the massive disturbance of the land during the road's construction.

5|$|The 400-series {{highways}} are {{a network}} of controlled-access highways throughout the southern portion of the Canadian province of Ontario, forming a special subset of the provincial highway system. They are analogous to the Interstate Highway System in the United States or the Autoroute system of neighbouring Quebec, but under provincial jurisdiction and regulated by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO). Although Ontario had been constructing divided highways <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> prior, 400-series designations were introduced in 1952. Initially only Highways400, 401 and 402 were numbered; other designations followed in the subsequent decades.|$|E
5|$|The Newport Pagnell Canal {{had opened}} in 1817 between the Grand Junction Canal at Great Linford and Newport Pagnell. The canal carried a {{reasonable}} level of traffic, but in 1845, the LNWR attempted {{to buy the}} canal, using it for a potential railway line. The offer was refused <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades,</b> until 1862, when the LNWR was able to purchase the canal for £9000. The canal closed in 1864. Despite this, the railway when built did not run on {{the line of the}} old canal.|$|E
5|$|The strike {{heightened}} public fear {{of labor}} unrest {{and the possible}} radicalism that lay behind it. It contributed to the public anxiety of the period known as the Red Scare of 1919–1920. The failure of this and other strikes {{in the years following}} World War I contributed to declining union membership in subsequent years. The American Federation of Labor responded to political pressure experienced during the strike and revoked the charters it had granted to police unions. That ended police unionism in the U.S. <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades,</b> as police would not try to organize until World War II.|$|E

5|$|Armin {{was once}} a troubled young man from Capital City, and finds himself in the Army. There, he met and befriended the real Sergeant Seymour Skinner, who became his mentor and helped him find meaning in his troubled life. Seymour told Armin that his dream was to become an {{elementary}} school principal after the war. Later, Seymour was declared missing and presumed dead. Armin took {{the news of the}} apparent death to Seymour's mother, Agnes. Upon meeting him, however, Agnes mistook him for her son, and Armin could not bear to deliver the message. He instead allowed Agnes to call him Seymour, and took over Seymour's life. Meanwhile, the real Seymour Skinner spent five years in a POW camp, then worked in a Chinese sweatshop <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> until it was shut down by the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|Extending the police's {{presence}} {{across the}} region was logistically challenging, requiring {{the creation of a}} network of new posts and the use of steamers to move supplies around the coast. It proved to be a harsh existence for the force, particularly when deliveries of supplies were delayed by bad weather. Work began on a railroad to Hudson Bay in 1908, continuing <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades,</b> which, although it required substantial police assistance, gradually eased the challenge of supplying the police outposts around the bay. The police opened temporary detachments around York Factory in 1912, and then at Port Nelson in 1913, where the police established their divisional headquarters. Patrols pushed up into Baker Lake and along the Coppermine River until, {{by the end of the}} decade, the police presence in Hudson Bay had been reduced to a bare minimum, with the force focusing on reaching out into ever more remote areas.|$|E

5|$|King's Highway 25, {{commonly}} referred to as Highway 25, was a highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. The north–south route connected several towns on its route northward from Burlington. The first section of Highway25, designated in 1925, travelled north from Highway5 to Milton. In 1928, the route was extended south into Burlington, following portions of Lower Middle Road to Highway2. The highway was extended north to Highway7 in 1937. That same year, a portion of Highway25 was made concurrent with The Middle Road, which would be renamed as the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) two years later. The route remained relatively unchanged <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades,</b> save for the southern end being truncated at the QEW in 1946. In 1963 it was extended north to Ospringe to meet Highway24. Another extension was added in 1974 to bring the route to Highway89 near Shelburne. The entire route was decommissioned in 1997 and 1998 as part of a province-wide downloading of highways deemed to be of regional importance.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for electrifying {{the line}} began {{as early as}} 1992, when the California Department of Transportation {{conducted}} an early feasibility study. <b>For</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades,</b> the project lay dormant {{due to lack of}} funding until Caltrain agreed to share its tracks with the California High-Speed Rail Authority (CHSRA), which was looking for a route for the constitutionally-mandated San Jose—San Francisco segment. The Authority agreed to partially fund the electrification project in exchange for rights to share the track. Construction contracts for electrification were awarded on July 2016 and groundbreaking was expected to occur in March 2017, but was delayed when the new United States Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao indefinitely deferred federal funding just before construction was about to begin. That same month, Caltrain removed the contractor responsible for implementing PTC for failure to perform on-budget and on-schedule. On May 2017, the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) announced its intention to sign the grant and reversed Secretary Chao's deferment. Construction formally began two months later.|$|E

She was 23 years old and pregnant when she began her doctoral studies, and the Rubins had one young child at home. She began to take classes with Francis Heyden, who recommended her to George Gamow, her eventual doctoral advisor. Her dissertation, completed in 1954, concluded that galaxies clumped together, rather than being randomly distributed through the universe, a controversial idea not pursued by others <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b> Throughout her graduate studies, she experienced discouraging sexism, including an incident where she {{was not allowed to}} meet with her advisor in his office, because women were not allowed in that area of the university.|$|E
