40|$|The Time Before That' is a partly hand-made artist's book, {{produced}} {{in a small}} edition of ten. The book was made {{in collaboration with the}} artist Bada Song to accompany Paul O'Kane's work in the Jerwood Space show 'For The Sake of the Image' (2010), curated by Suki Chan. In 'The Time Before That' O'Kane reprinted a set of photographs, taken c. 1980 during a time shortly before he learned that his father was terminally ill. He writes: "I had often thought of that particular time as one of relative innocence, before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> life and death could hurt and divert. As I have sometimes believed that photography (or my photography) can transmit psychological conditions I was interested in whether this set of poorly maintained, rather scratched and grubby (30 year-old) slides retained any real sense of who and how I was at that time. I was also interested in the way that I was able to make no evaluative judgement or selection but to simply include the contents of a little box of slide unified and valued only for their moment of coming into being. In making the book with these distressed images I was also drawn into a critique of established values about photography e. g. as clean, technically able, new, current etc. I was also struck by the impersonal distance between me and these aging images, an impersonality that photography already introduces through its mechanical means but which was here exacerbated or reinforced by the passing of time. (After Marcel Duchamp of course, impersonality in art might be as sought-after as various modes of expressionism were prior to Duchamp.) " (Source: [URL] The book is completed with two short, written reflections on these matters, referring to the work of Craigie Horsfield and John Coplans, and begins with a quote from Jean Baudrillard: “When the real is no longer what it used to be, nostalgia assumes its full meaning. ...|$|R

[...] "It was I who asked you. It was I who killed him. I went round by the far gate after hearing he was there, and, cutting across the wood, I met Montague Nevitt in the path by The Tangle. I went there to meet him; I went there to confront him; but not of malice prepense to murder him. I wanted to question him about a family matter. Why I needed to question him no one henceforth shall ever know. That secret, thank Heaven, rests now in Montague Nevitt's grave.

60|$|As Shelley sailed {{along those}} great rivers and saw or {{imagined}} the cave that associated itself with rivers in his mind, he saw half-ruined towers upon the hilltops, and once {{at any rate}} a tower is used to symbolize a meaning that is the contrary to the meaning symbolized by caves. Cythna's lover is brought through the cave {{where there is a}} polluted fountain to a high tower, for being man's far-seeing mind, when the world has cast him out he must to the 'towers of thought's crowned powers'; nor is it possible for Shelley to have forgotten this first imprisonment when he made men imprison Lionel in a tower for a like offence; and because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> it is to forget a symbolical meaning, once one has found it, I believe Shelley had more than a romantic scene in his mind when he made Prince Athanase follow his mysterious studies in a lighted tower above the sea, and when he made the old hermit watch over Laon in his sickness in a half-ruined tower, wherein the sea, here doubtless as to Cythna, 'the one mind,' threw 'spangled sands' and 'rarest sea shells.' The tower, important in Maeterlinck, as in Shelley, is, like the sea, and rivers, and caves with fountains, a very ancient symbol, and would perhaps, as years went by, have grown more important in his poetry. The contrast between it and the cave in Laon and Cythna suggests a contrast between the mind looking outward upon men and things and the mind looking inward upon itself, {{which may or may not}} have been in Shelley's mind, but certainly helps, with one knows not how many other dim meanings, to give the poem mystery and shadow. It is only by ancient symbols, by symbols that have numberless meanings beside the one or two the writer lays an emphasis upon, or the half-score he knows of, that any highly subjective art can escape from the barrenness and shallowness of a too conscious arrangement, into the abundance and depth of nature. The poet of essences and pure ideas must seek in the half-lights that glimmer from symbol to symbol as if to the ends of the earth, all that the epic and dramatic poet finds of mystery and shadow in the accidental circumstance of life.|$|E
60|$|My dearest Sarianna,--We are on {{the verge}} of {{returning}} to Florence, for a short time--only to pack up, I believe, and go further south--to 'meet the revolution,' tell the dearest Nonno, with my love. The case is that though I am really convalescent and look well (Robert has even let me take to Penini a little, which is conclusive), it is considered dangerous for me to run the risk of even a Florence winter. You see I have been very ill. The physician thought there was pressure of the lungs on the heart, and, under those circumstances, that I must avoid irritation of the lungs by any cold. Say nothing which can reach my sisters and frighten them; and after all I care very little about doctors, except that <b>I</b> do <b>know</b> myself <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> renewals of the late attack would go with me. But I mean to take care, and use God's opportunities of getting strong again. Also it seems to me that I have taken a leap within these ten days, and that the strength comes back in a fuller tide. After all, it is not a cruel punishment to us to have to go to Rome again this winter, though it will be an undesirable expense, and though we did wish to keep quiet this winter, the taste for constant wanderings having passed away as much for me as for Robert. We begin to see that by no possible means can one spend as much money to so small an end. And then we don't work so well--don't live to as much use, either for ourselves or others. Isa Blagden bids us observe that we pretend to live at Florence, and are not there much above two months in the year, what with going away for the summer and going away for the winter. It's too true. It's the drawback of Italy. To live in one place here is impossible for us almost, just as to live out of Italy at all is impossible for us. It isn't caprice--that's all I mean to say--on our part.|$|R
60|$|Remarkable indeed was the {{behaviour}} of {{the young}} priest. At his entrance on board the ship, he fell on {{his face in the}} most humble prostration to the Almighty. I thought, indeed, he had fallen into a swoon, and so ran to help him up; but he modestly told me, he was returning his thanks to the Almighty, desiring me to leave him a few moments, and that, next to his Creator, he would return me thanks also. And indeed he did so about three minutes after, with great seriousness, and affection, while the tears stood in his eyes, which convinced me of the gratitude of his soul. Nor did he less show his piety and wisdom in applying himself to his country people, and labouring to compose them, by the most powerful reasons, arguments, and persuasions. And when, indeed, these people had taken their night's repose, in such lodgings as our ship would allow, we found nothing but the best of manners, and the most civil acknowledgements, for which the French are eminently remarkable. The next day the Captain and one of the priests desired to speak with me and my nephew the commander. They told us, that they had saved some money and valuable things out of the ruined vessel, which was at our service; only that they desired to be set on shore some where in our way. At the first my nephew was for accepting the money; but <b>I</b> (who <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> my case would have been, had the Portuguese Captain served me so) persuaded him to the contrary; and therefore told them, that as we had done nothing but what we were obliged to do, by nature and humanity, and what we ourselves might expect from others in such calamity; so we took them up to save them, not to plunder them, or leave them naked upon the land, to perish for want of subsistance, and therefore would not accept their money: but as to landing them, that was a great difficulty; for being bound to the East Indies, it was impossible wilfully to change our voyage upon their particular account, nor could my nephew (who was under charter party to pursue it by was of Brazil) answer it to the freighters. All that we could do, was to put ourselves in the way of meeting some ships homeward bound from the West Indies, that, if possible, they might get a passage to France or England. Indeed, they were very thankful for our first kindness; but were under great concern, especially the passengers, at their being carried to the East Indies. They begged therefore, I would keep on the banks of Newfoundland, where, probably, they might meet with some ship, or sloop to carry them to Canada, whence they came. As this was but a reasonable request, I was inclined to grant it, since it was no breach of charter party, and that the laws of God and nature obliged us to do what good we could to our fellow-creatures; and besides the danger we ourselves should be in for want of provisions: so we consented to carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather would permit; if not, that we should carry them to Martinico in the West Indies. But, as it happened, in a week's time we made the banks of Newfoundland, where the French people hired a bark to carry them to France. But the young priest being desirous to go to the East Indies, I readily agreed to it, because I liked his conversation, and two or three of the French sailors also entered themselves on board our ship.|$|R
6000|$|Those {{who knew}} him will {{recognize}} in my third act the allusion to the patent Shorthand in which he used to write postcards, and which may be acquired from a four and six-penny manual published by the Clarendon Press. The postcards which Mrs. Higgins describes are such as I have received from Sweet. I would decipher a sound which a cockney would represent by zerr, and a Frenchman by seu, and then write demanding with some heat what on earth it meant. Sweet, with boundless contempt for my stupidity, would reply that it not only meant but obviously was the word Result, as no other Word containing that sound, and capable of making sense with the context, existed in any language spoken on earth. That less expert mortals should require fuller indications was beyond Sweet's patience. Therefore, though {{the whole point of}} his [...] "Current Shorthand" [...] is that it can express every sound in the language perfectly, vowels as well as consonants, and that your hand has to make no stroke except the easy and current ones with which you write m, n, and u, l, p, and q, scribbling them at whatever angle comes easiest to you, his unfortunate determination to make this remarkable and quite legible script serve also as a Shorthand reduced it in his own practice to the most inscrutable of cryptograms. His true objective was the provision of a full, accurate, legible script for our noble but ill-dressed language; but he was led past that by his contempt for the popular Pitman system of Shorthand, which he called the Pitfall system. The triumph of Pitman was a triumph of business organization: there was a weekly paper to persuade you to learn Pitman: there were cheap textbooks and exercise books and transcripts of speeches for you to copy, and schools where experienced teachers coached you up to the necessary proficiency. Sweet could not organize his market in that fashion. He {{might as well have been}} the Sybil who tore up the leaves of prophecy that nobody would attend to. The four and six-penny manual, mostly in his lithographed handwriting, that was never vulgarly advertized, may perhaps some day be taken up by a syndicate and pushed upon the public as The Times pushed the Encyclopaedia Britannica; but until then it will certainly not prevail against Pitman. I have bought three copies of it during my lifetime; and I am informed by the publishers that its cloistered existence is still a steady and healthy one. I actually learned the system two several times; and yet the shorthand in which I am writing these lines is Pitman's. And the reason is, that my secretary cannot transcribe Sweet, having been perforce taught in the schools of Pitman. Therefore, Sweet railed at Pitman as vainly as Thersites railed at Ajax: his raillery, however it may have eased his soul, gave no popular vogue to Current Shorthand. Pygmalion Higgins is not a portrait of Sweet, to whom the adventure of Eliza Doolittle would have been impossible; still, as will be seen, there are touches of Sweet in the play. With Higgins's physique and temperament Sweet might have set the Thames on fire. As it was, he impressed himself professionally on Europe to an extent that made his comparative personal obscurity, and the failure of Oxford to do justice to his eminence, a puzzle to foreign specialists in his subject. I do not blame Oxford, because I think Oxford is quite right in demanding a certain social amenity from its nurslings (heaven knows it is not exorbitant in its requirements!); for although <b>I</b> well <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> it is for a man of genius with a seriously underrated subject to maintain serene and kindly relations with the men who underrate it, and who keep all the best places for less important subjects which they profess without originality and sometimes without much capacity for them, still, if he overwhelms them with wrath and disdain, he cannot expect them to heap honors on him.|$|R

6000|$|With the Poem called The Election, here alluded to, {{which had}} been more than once revised and reconsidered, he was still under some hesitations; but at last had well-nigh resolved, as from the first it was clear he would do, on {{publishing}} it. This occupied some occasional portion of his thoughts. But his grand private affair, I believe, was now Strafford; to which, or to its adjuncts, all working hours were devoted. Sterling's notions of Tragedy are high enough. This is what he writes once, in reference to his own task in these weeks: [...] "Few, <b>I</b> fancy, <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much <b>harder</b> it is to write a Tragedy than to realize or be one. Every man has in his heart and lot, if he pleases, and too many whether they please or no, all the woes of OEdipus and Antigone. But it takes the One, the Sophocles of a thousand years, to utter these in the full depth and harmony of creative song. Curious, by the way, how that Dramatic Form of the old Greek, with only some superficial changes, remains a law not only for the stage, but for the thoughts of all Poets; and what a charm it has even for the reader who never saw a theatre. The Greek Plays and Shakspeare have interested a hundred as books, for one who has seen their writings acted. How lightly does the mere clown, the idle school-girl, build a private theatre in the fancy, and laugh or weep with Falstaff and Macbeth: with how entire an oblivion of the artificial nature of the whole contrivance, which thus compels them to be their own architects, machinists, scene-painters, and actors! In fact, the artifice succeeds,--becomes grounded in the substance of the soul: and every one loves to feel how he is thus brought {{face to face with the}} brave, the fair, the woful and the great of all past ages; looks into their eyes, and feels the beatings of their hearts; and reads, over the shoulder, the secret written tablets of the busiest and the largest brains; while the Juggler, by whose cunning the whole strange beautiful absurdity is set in motion, keeps himself hidden; sings loud with a mouth unmoving as that of a statue, and makes the human race cheat itself unanimously and delightfully by the illusion that he preordains; while as an obscure Fate, he sits invisible, and hardly lets his being be divined by those who cannot flee him. The Lyric Art is childish, and the Epic barbarous, compared to this. But of the true and perfect Drama it may be said, as of even higher mysteries, Who is sufficient for these things?"--On this Tragedy of Strafford, writing it and again writing it, studying for it, and bending himself with his whole strength to do his best on it, he expended many strenuous months,--"above a year of his life," [...] he computes, in all.|$|R

I have said this both publicly and privately, but it has been hard to tell people that they ought to leave their homes, to go out into strange and new surroundings, to endure discomforts and danger—perhaps to face death—it has been hard to tell people that this was their duty and then to remain comfortably at home myself. So that is why I have left you for an indefinite period.I am proud, very proud of what Frittenden has done. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> it has been for many of the soldiers to leave their homes and their families and occupations; but the harder it has been, the greater the credit and the greater the reward.I need not tell you that Frittenden will be constantly in my thoughts and that it will make things easier for me here if I hear that everything is going on well in the Parish.I ask for your prayers. I ask you to pray that I may be a help to those to whom I have to minister out here. That God will bless and keep you all, is the prayer ofYour Affectionate Rector,(Signed) Rupert E. Inglis.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, Herring {{left the}} series {{in order to}} {{permanently}} migrate the character of Lucy to ABC Daytime's new soap opera Port Charles, which was a spin-off to General Hospital. Herring was assisted by two other characters, Kevin Collins and Scott Baldwin, in their move to the new soap. Initially, Herring was doubtful about starring in a new spin-off. She said: [...] "I {{was a part of}} the decision. I got a phone call from a friend who said, 'I think they’re going to spin General Hospital off,' and I thought it was a prank, like an April Fool’s. Because I thought it really wasn’t possible to separate core characters out of a show. And then Wendy Riche who was the producer at the time called pretty quickly after that, and said, 'We have this great idea, and it’s your character, we’re bringing Kin back, and we’ll have GH people flopping back and forth. And Doc Kevin will be there and we’ll create this whole other world.'" [...] Herring explained, [...] "part of me was so fearful because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> it is to be successful in daytime, and also I fought hard to stay viable all those years before we did that. So it was really scary". She remained on Port Charles, which experienced low ratings, until its 2003 cancellation.|$|E
