25|$|The HPI (Human Poverty Index) {{is used to}} {{calculate}} the percentage of people in a country who live in relative poverty. In order to better differentiate {{the number of people in}} abnormally poor living conditions the HPI-1 is used in developing countries, and the HPI-2 is used in developed countries. The HPI-1 is calculated based on the percentage of people not expected to survive to 40, the adult illiteracy rate, the percentage of people without access to safe water, health services and the percentage of children under 5 who are underweight. The HPI-2 is calculated based on the percentage of people who do not survive to 60, the adult <b>functional</b> <b>illiteracy</b> rate and the percentage of people living below 50% of median personal disposable income.|$|E
50|$|The {{characteristics}} of <b>functional</b> <b>illiteracy</b> vary from one culture to another, as some cultures require better {{reading and writing}} skills than others. A reading level that might be sufficient to make a farmer functionally literate {{in a rural area}} of a developing country might qualify as <b>functional</b> <b>illiteracy</b> in an urban area of a technologically advanced country. In languages with regular spelling, <b>functional</b> <b>illiteracy</b> is usually defined simply as reading too slow for practical use, inability to effectively use dictionaries and written manuals, etc.|$|E

In contrast, functionally illiterate persons can read and possibly write simple sentences with a limited vocabulary, but cannot read or write well {{enough to deal with}} the everyday requirements of life in their own society.|$|E

5000|$|The Institute of Education Sciences has {{conducted}} large scale assessments of adult proficiency in 1992 and 2003 using a common methodology from which trends could be measured.

There was no significant change in Prose or Document skills and {{a slight increase in}} Quantitative attributes. As in 2008, roughly 15% of the sample could function at the highest levels in all three categories. Roughly 50% were at either basic or below basic levels of proficiency in all three categories. The study identifies a class of adults who, although not meeting criteria for <b>functional</b> <b>illiteracy,</b> face reduced job opportunities and life prospects due to inadequate literacy levels relative to the requirements released in April 2002 and reapplied in 2003 giving trend data. It involved lengthy interviews of over -4.7% adults statistically balanced for age, gender, ethnicity, education level, and location (urban, suburban, or rural) in 12 states across the U.S. and was designed to represent the U.S. population as a whole. This government study showed that 21% to 23% of adult Americans were not [...] "able to locate information in text", could not [...] "make low-level inferences using printed materials", and were unable to [...] "integrate easily identifiable pieces of information." [...] Further, this study showed that 41% to 44% of U.S. adults in the lowest level on the literacy scale (literacy rate of 35 or below) were living in poverty.|$|E

40|$|Formally, {{availability}} {{of education for}} children has increased around the world over the last decades. However, despite having a successful formal education career, adults can become functional illiterates. <b>Functional</b> <b>illiteracy</b> means that a person cannot use reading, writing and calculation skills for his/her own and the community’s development. <b>Functional</b> <b>illiteracy</b> has considerable negative effects not only on personal development, but also in economic and social terms. Although <b>functional</b> <b>illiteracy</b> has been highly publicized in mass media in the recent years, there is limited scientific knowledge about the people termed functional illiterates; definition, assessment and differential diagnoses with respect to related numerical and linguistic impairments are rarely studied and controversial. The first goal of our review is to give a comprehensive overview {{of the research on}} <b>functional</b> <b>illiteracy</b> by describing gaps in knowledge within the field and to outline and address the basic questions concerning who can be considered as functional illiterates: (1) Do they possess basic skills? (2) In which abilities do they have the largest deficits? (3) Are numerical and linguistic deficits related? (4) What is the fundamental reason for their difficulties? (5) Are there main differences between functional illiterates, illiterates and dyslexics? We will see that despite partial evidence, there is still much research needed to answer these questions. Secondly, we emphasize the timeliness for a new and more precise definition that results in uniform sampling, better diagnosis, conclusion and intervention. We propose the following working definition {{as the result of the}} review: <b>functional</b> <b>illiteracy</b> is the incapability to understand complex texts despite adequate schooling, age, language skills, elementary reading skills and IQ. These inabilities must also not be fully explained by sensory, domain-general cognitive, neurological or mental disorders. In sum, we suggest that <b>functional</b> <b>illiteracy</b> must be more thoroughly understood and assessed from a theoretical, empirical and diagnostic perspective...|$|E
40|$|<b>Functional</b> <b>illiteracy</b> {{comprises}} {{citizens with}} limited ability to read, write and perform basic calculations inherent {{to social and}} professional life, despite having access to the formal education system. Considering the present scenario of judgment about the essence of form arising from the convergence to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the present study aimed to investigate whether <b>functional</b> <b>illiteracy</b> is a relevant phenomenon using a sample of students from an undergraduate course in Accounting. Using a questionnaire with items from the 1993 National Assessment of Adult Literacy – NAAL, a model was derived using the True Score from Item Response Theory as the dependent variable, and applying Cluster Analysis and Logistic Regression techniques. As a result, {{it was noted that}} <b>functional</b> <b>illiteracy</b> is relevant to senior’s undergraduate Accounting students, given that 40 % showed evidence of the phenomenon. The seniors presented a percentage of overall accuracy of approximately 45 % in document skills, quantitative skills and verbal skills. This deficit evaluated the ability to apply new information to make inferences, the ability of decision-making and, ultimately, quantitative and computational capacity. Given these results, we can conclude that the minimizing <b>functional</b> <b>illiteracy</b> negatively impacts, minimizing the learning and, in second time when students are in the labor market, deteriorating the quality of the information generated...|$|E
