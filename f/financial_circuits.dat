While microfinance institutions (MFIs) act under the flag of “serving the common good,” there are still the interests of institutional investors behind them, who are looking to profit through international <b>financial</b> <b>circuits.</b> On one hand, microfinance is part of financial innovation in the global <b>financial</b> <b>circuits.</b> On the other hand, women’s bancarization inserts them into the labor market, hence into the <b>financial</b> <b>circuits.</b> MFIs become part of the shadow financial system. When debating microcredit’s profitability from a gender perspective, I note both the financial effectiveness of microcredits and the role of women as highly profitable economic agents. Is there a relation between financialization and microcredit? Is microcredit an achievement that will improve the economic, political, and social environment for women? Why is it that women’s bancarization has been a priority of international financial organizations? Microcredit with a woman’s face confirms the suggested hypotheses. Their empowerment through microcredit is a new way for financial investors to obtain higher profits through MFIs. The highest interest rates that MFIs charges are an expression of financialization by institutional investors...|$|E

Based on Shari'a Law, IFS firms provide banking, finance and insurance respecting faith-based prohibitions on interest, speculation and risk taking. Although IFS firms operate across a variety of scales and involve a range of actors, this paper focuses on the transnational capacities of Shari'a experts employed by IFS firms. These scholars use their extensive knowledge of Shari'a Law to assess the 'Islamic' character of a firm's operations, and assist the development of Shari'a-compliant products. As they embody necessary entry-points into Islamic circuits of knowledge and authority, members of what we dub the 'global Shari'a elite' can be regarded as 'gatekeepers' of Islamic <b>financial</b> <b>circuits.</b> Drawing on a comprehensive data source we present a geographical analysis of Shari'a board membership, nationality and educational background of 253 Shari'a scholars.

When calling for a broadening of the existing analytical remit of cultural economy scholarship, however, emphasis is also placed on both regulation and governance and monetary valuations as constitutive and relational forces in the assembly of markets in the making. Regulation and governance are shown to deploy sovereign powers and techniques to territorialize, legitimize, and bolster the <b>financial</b> market <b>circuits</b> of crowdfunding. Money, meanwhile, is shown to play a dual role. While it certainly enables calculative and marketized valuations, money simultaneously creates scope for a multiplicity of values to be inscribed into its circulations such that the diversity of the crowdfunding economy persists and proliferates amidst financial marketization...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present research is to propose a debate about the violations perpetrated over credit money due to the rupture of Bretton Woods’s agreements {{and the emergence of}} a shadow financial system. These changes distorted credit money as one of the fundamental pillars for stability and development of international economic system, causing the current crisis. Our research is mainly based on the post-keynesian theoretical approach about credit money developed by Parguez (2010), Gnos and Rochon (2004), Secareccia and Parguez (2000), etc. The other theoretical grounds are the analysis made by Tobias and Hyun Song over the shadow financial system and the valuable contributions of Parguez (2010), Guttman (2010), Girón and Chapoy (2009) about financial crisis in Europe, United States and Latin America.

40|$|African Studies Seminar series. Paper {{presented}} 22 Febraury, 1993 The {{period of}} the Rhodesian Front party's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) is sometimes described as providing a "hot-house" atmosphere for economic development, a characterisation which stems from extraordinary rates of growth from 1966 - 1974 {{as well as from}} the various barriers to free financial flows erected by the state. 1 These barriers imposed a condition of semi-autarchy on the <b>financial</b> <b>circuit</b> of capital, which in turn had implications for accumulation and uneven geographical and sectoral development. The most significant of these may be that the hot-house financial environment exacerbated capitalist boom-bust tendencies, in an economic context which was already deteriorating due largely to overproduction in relation to the small size of the local market, as well as to exogenous factors. When a classic crisis of "overaccumulation" 2 of capital emerged in the mid 1970 s, the effect on the social and political formation was formidable, and indeed has not been resolved to this date. One reason why different attempts to deal with the crisis have not been successful is that economic development has generally been viewed in static and aspatial terms, with scant regard for the complex roles of space and of time. This, then, is a key challenge to the paper: while constructing an empirically- and theoreticallyinformed argument about the Rhodesian UDI period, I attempt to analyze spatial and temporal features that shed brighter light on limits to the economy's development...|$|R

Developing a competitive banking system allows to avoid monopoly situations creating the possibility for each bank to be oriented to a certain range of services and products provided willing to increase continuously their quality and attractiveness. The dynamic analysis of effective competition in the domestic banking system would allow determination of factors with negative influence on the rate of participation of each bank in the total bank portfolio items, and also the possibility of reviewing the financial policies pursued in the banking sector. Study of bank system competition is a topic of interest both for financial analysts, and for authorities, given the opportunities arising: qualitative assessment of competition in the banking sector, verifying in which way the regulations in force have influenced the dynamics of competition, measuring the intensity of competition in the banking sector, detection, based on statistical analysis of competitive situation, of the main qualitative types (categories) of financial institutions active in the financial market.

40|$|Money {{laundering}} is the disguising of {{the illegal}} origin of money by bringing {{it back into the}} legal <b>financial</b> <b>circuit.</b> Therefore, in this dissertation I try to establish a theoretical framework to understand the role of social networks, and the link between criminals and legal actors in the money laundering process. I focus on the money laundering method called smurfing; the splitting of large criminal proceeds into small inconspicuous amounts, and since this technique typically requires a network, it requires potential criminals to form links with other people and to construct a money laundering network to launder their money. The research questions are focused on how the networks are formed when criminals strategically form links to launder their money and what the shape of the network is at the macro-level. Moreover, focus is also on optimal policies to fight crime and money laundering, both at the national and the international level. Towards this end, I introduce social network and game theory into the field of money laundering. The study also includes some simulations in order to find the optimal budget for anti-money laundering policy. InChapter 2, I analyze a typical drug-crime scenario by presenting a simple model to study the formation of a money laundering network in this context. I assume that there are three types of actors: criminal bosses, foot soldiers, and dishonest workers. I show that the money laundering network at the macro level has an extended inter-linked star structure in which the talented criminal bosses are fully interconnected. I also show that agents’ willingness to become criminals is endogenously dependent on the wage of workers. In Chapters 3 and 4, I consider only two groups of agents in the network, potential criminals and workers. After characterizing the network I analyze the national and international policy to combat money laundering. The crucial focus of Chapter 3 is the analysis of the optimal mixture of anti-crime and anti-money laundering policies. Which policies should a law enforcement agency focus on to combat either crime or money laundering in order to minimize total criminal activity in a society? In the present model, this is expressed in terms of an optimal budget sharing rule. I also empirically implement the model using real world data and calculate the optimal policy response numerically with a macro-level “sufficient statistics’’ approach. The aim of Chapter 4 is to theoretically assess different options for transnational policy cooperation to fight crime and money laundering. I consider four regimes to combat money laundering: a decentral regime without an international information exchange; a decentral regime with an information exchange; a central regime with an evenly split budget among the two countries; a central regime with a tailor-made budget. I determined the best option from the viewpoint of each country and from the overall viewpoint, considering countries that differ in average income and country sizes. My findings show that the first-best regime is to implement a central authority which allocates tailor-made budgets...|$|R
