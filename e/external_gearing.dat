2500|$|<b>External</b> <b>gearing</b> is {{so called}} {{because all the}} {{sprockets}} involved are readily visible. There may be up to 4 chainrings attached to the crankset and pedals, and typically between 5 and 11 sprockets making up the cogset attached to the rear wheel. Modern front and rear derailleurs typically consist of a moveable chain-guide that is operated remotely by a Bowden cable attached to a shifter mounted on the down tube, handlebar stem, or handlebar. A shifter may be a single lever, or a pair of levers, or a twist grip; some shifters may be incorporated with brake levers into a single unit. When a rider operates the shifter while pedalling, the change in cable tension moves the chain-guide from side to side, [...] "derailing" [...] the chain onto different sprockets. The rear derailleur also has spring-mounted jockey wheels which take up any slack in the chain.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{to the development of}} a new type of actuator for use in robotic toy automation. The work covers an incremental series of experiments that examine, analyze, prototype, and test various ideas for converting the vibration of a voice coil into rotational motion. In its final form, it is believed that this actuator will provide a lowspeed, high-torque output using a single unit, eliminating the need for <b>external</b> <b>gearing.</b> Currently, such motion is actuated by direct current motors equipped with gear boxes that are both noisy and bulky. This new type of actuator will function more quietly, using a frequency lower than humans' sensory threshold for sound while making the movement of robotic toys more life-like when used to imitate animals. Furthermore, by using relatively inexpensive voice coils, this new type of actuator will potentially be less expensive to manufacture than currently used motors, and bring toys one step closer to accurately representing real life forms. The current prototype has some of the characteristics desired in a DC motor replacement, exhibiting a relatively high output torque and low angular velocity. However, the power output is much smaller that what would be useful. Also, the current prototype is larger than what would be useful in most animatronic toys. Future testing will need to address these issues in order to make the actuator into a viable product. by Jacob M. Muhleman. Thesis (S. B.)

There are two main variations; <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> pumps which use two <b>external</b> spur <b>gears,</b> and internal gear pumps which use an external and an internal spur gears (internal spur gear teeth face inwards, see below).

40|$|<b>External</b> spur <b>gear</b> {{pumps are}} {{exceedingly}} useful components in common hydraulic systems. The main issue with <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> pumps {{is that all}} current models are limited to only fixed-displacement. This means that for every revolution of the gears inside the pump, a set amount of fluid will always be displaced. Consequently, <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> pumps are limited in their use because they can only operate at full throttle causing inefficiencies when reduced displacement is needed. The successful procurement of a variable displacement gear pump will allow a more efficient use of hydraulic systems, {{such as in the}} displacement controlled systems used in some heavy construction equipment. In this research approach, the displacement is varied by changing the timing of the gears inside the pump. More specifically, changing the timing of the gears’ connections with the inlet and outlet grooves alters the available volume in the gears’ spaces, subsequently varying the displacement. With this in mind, additional research was conducted to develop an actuation system for the aforementioned process. This includes the design of new gears, bearing blocks, and additional hydraulics for use in a modified existing commercial pump. Simulations have shown the implementation of the design allowed for a 67 % reduction in displacement, and thus successful introduction of variable displacement into an <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> pump.

Nondimensional flowrates and fluctuation coefficients of gear pumps are discussed. By using the formula, flowrates can be calculated accurately and efficiently. Results indicate that: {{in the case of}} the same displacement (except teeth number and tooth width, other parameters of the gear pump are the same) the gear pump flow pulsation decreases with the increasing of the teeth number.

40|$|<b>External</b> <b>gear</b> {{pumps and}} motors are robust and low cost {{components}} and {{are widely used}} in industrial and mobile applications; nowadays however, optimal global efficiency represents a more crucial aspect to be considered when designing a hydraulic machine. For this reason, it becomes a primary necessity to investigate the phenomena which determine and affect the hydraulic machine total efficiency. In this work, the volumetric efficiency of <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> pumps is investigated {{by means of a}} mathematical model already presented in a previous paper and the results obtained are compared with experimental data. First of all, the mathematical model is briefly presented; then the predicted results are discussed considering the influence of the pump operating conditions. Moreover, the influence on the volumetric efficiency of the behaviour of the hydraulically balanced bearing blocks, and hence of the pump axial balance, is exposed. In particular, it is shown that the tilted position of the bearing blocks and the height of the lateral clearance can greatly affect the volumetric efficiency. The data coming from an experimental investigation carried out on commercial <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> pump units are then presented; both the volumetric and the mechanical efficiency have been measured.
