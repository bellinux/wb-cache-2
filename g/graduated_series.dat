60|$|From these several {{considerations}} it {{cannot be}} doubted that the geological record, {{viewed as a}} whole, is extremely imperfect; but if we confine our attention to any one formation, it becomes {{much more difficult to}} understand why we do not therein find closely graduated varieties between the allied species which lived at its commencement and at its close. Several cases are on record of the same species presenting varieties in the upper and lower parts of the same formation. Thus Trautschold gives a number of instances with Ammonites, and Hilgendorf has described a most curious case of ten graduated forms of Planorbis multiformis in the successive beds of a fresh-water formation in Switzerland.

60|$|A <b>graduated</b> <b>series</b> can be {{followed}} from violent to moderate laughter, {{to a broad}} smile, to a gentle smile, and to the expression of mere cheerfulness. During excessive laughter the whole body is often thrown backward and shakes, or is almost convulsed; the respiration is much disturbed; the head and face become gorged with blood, with the veins distended; and the orbicular muscles are spasmodically contracted {{in order to protect}} the eyes. Tears are freely shed. Hence, as formerly remarked, it is scarcely possible to point out any difference between the tear-stained face of a person after a paroxysm of excessive laughter and after a bitter crying-fit.[15] It is probably due to the close similarity of the spasmodic movements caused by these widely different emotions that hysteric patients alternately cry and laugh with violence, and that young children sometimes pass suddenly from the one to the other state. Mr. Swinhoe informs me that he has often seen the Chinese, when suffering from deep grief, burst out into hysterical fits of laughter.|$|E
60|$|The {{first and}} most {{important}} character of clouds, is dependent on the different altitudes at which they are formed. The atmosphere may be conveniently considered as divided into three spaces, each inhabited by clouds of specific character altogether different, though, in reality there is no distinct limit fixed between them by nature, clouds being formed at every altitude, and partaking according to their altitude, more or less of the characters of the upper or lower regions. The scenery of the sky is thus formed of an infinitely <b>graduated</b> <b>series</b> of systematic forms of cloud, each of which has its own region in which alone it is formed, and each of which has specific characters which can only be properly determined by comparing them as they are found clearly distinguished by intervals of considerable space. I shall therefore consider the sky as divided into three regions--the upper region, or region of the cirrus; the central region, or region of the stratus; the lower region, or the region of the rain-cloud.|$|E

60|$|So, also, {{the broad}} {{distinction}} between reproduction by seeds or ova and propagation by buds, though perfect {{in some of}} the lowest forms of life, becomes evanescent in others; and even the most absolute law we know in the physiology of genuine reproduction--that of sexual cooperation--has its exceptions in both kingdoms in parthenogenesis, to which in the vegetable kingdom a most curious and intimate series of gradations leads. In plants, likewise, a long and finely <b>graduated</b> <b>series</b> of transitions leads from bisexual to unisexual blossoms; and so in various other respects. Everywhere we may perceive that Nature secures her ends, and makes her distinctions on the whole manifest and real but everywhere without abrupt breaks We need not wonder therefore that gradations between species and varieties should occur; the more so, since genera, tribes, and other groups into which the naturalist collocates species, are far from being always absolutely limited in Nature, though they are necessarily represented to be so in systems. From the necessity of the case, the classifications of the naturalist abruptly define where Nature more or less blends. Our systems are nothing, if not definite. They express differences, and some of the coarser gradations. But this evinces not their perfection, but their imperfection. Even the best of them are to the system of Nature what consecutive patches of the seven colors are to the rainbow.|$|E
6000|$|In endeavouring {{to explain}} these {{phenomena}} {{as having been}} brought about by variation and natural selection, {{we start with the}} fact that white varieties frequently occur, and when protected from enemies show no incapacity for continued existence and increase. We know, further, that varieties of many other tints occasionally occur; and as [...] "the survival of the fittest" [...] must inevitably weed out those whose colours are prejudicial and preserve those whose colours are a safeguard, we require no other mode of accounting for the protective tints of arctic and desert animals. But this being granted, there is such a perfectly continuous and <b>graduated</b> <b>series</b> of examples of every kind of protective imitation, up to the most wonderful cases of what is termed [...] "mimicry," [...] that we can find no place at which to draw the line, and say,--so far variation and natural selection will account for the phenomena, but for all the rest we require a more potent cause. The counter theories that have been proposed, that of the [...] "special creation" [...] of each imitative form, that of the action of [...] "similar conditions of existence" [...] for some of the cases, and of the laws of [...] "hereditary descent and the reversion to ancestral forms" [...] for others,--have all been shown to be beset with difficulties, and the two latter to be directly contradicted by some of the most constant and most remarkable of the facts to be accounted for.|$|E
6000|$|Another {{and more}} serious {{difficulty}} {{in determining the}} rank of the several forms is that, according to Gallesio (10/16. 'Teoria della Riproduzione' page 53.) they largely intercross without artificial aid; thus he positively states that seeds taken from lemon-trees (C. lemonum) growing mingled with the citron (C. medica), which is generally considered as a distinct species, produced a <b>graduated</b> <b>series</b> of varieties between these two forms. Again, an Adam's apple was produced from the seed of a sweet orange, which grew close to lemons and citrons. But such facts hardly aid us in determining whether to rank these forms as species or varieties; for it is now known that undoubted species of Verbascum, Cistus, Primula, Salix, etc., frequently cross {{in a state of}} nature. If indeed it were proved that plants of the orange tribe raised from these crosses were even partially sterile, it would be a strong argument in favour of their rank as species. Gallesio asserts that this is the case; but he does not distinguish between sterility from hybridism and from the effects of culture; and he almost destroys the force of this statement by another (10/17. Gallesio 'Teoria della Riproduzione' page 69.) namely, that when he impregnated the flowers of the common orange with the pollen taken from undoubted VARIETIES of the orange, monstrous fruits were produced, which included [...] "little pulp, and had no seeds, or imperfect seeds." ...|$|E

60|$|From {{a broken}} stair-like base, washed, as {{the steps of}} a water-palace, by the waves, the tower rose in entablatures of strata to a shaven summit. These uniform layers, which compose the mass, form its most {{peculiar}} feature. For at their lines of junction they project flatly into encircling shelves, from top to bottom, rising one above another in <b>graduated</b> <b>series.</b> And as the eaves of any old barn or abbey are alive with swallows, so were all these rocky ledges with unnumbered sea-fowl. Eaves upon eaves, and nests upon nests. Here and there were long birdlime streaks of a ghostly white staining the tower from sea to air, readily accounting for its sail-like look afar. All would have been bewitchingly quiescent, {{were it not for}} the demoniac din created by the birds. Not only were the eaves rustling with them, but they flew densely overhead, spreading themselves into a winged and continually shifting canopy. The tower is the resort of aquatic birds for hundreds of leagues around. To the north, to the east, to the west, stretches nothing but eternal ocean; so that the man-of-war hawk coming from the coasts of North America, Polynesia, or Peru, makes his first land at Rodondo. And yet though Rodondo be terra-firma, no land-bird ever lighted on it. Fancy a red-robin or a canary there! What a falling into the hands of the Philistines, when the poor warbler should be surrounded by such locust-flights of strong bandit birds, with long bills cruel as daggers.|$|E
6000|$|The {{other two}} {{supposed}} explanations, {{which may be}} shortly expressed as the theories of [...] "similar conditions" [...] and of [...] "heredity," [...] agree in making mimicry, where it exists, an adventitious circumstance not necessarily connected with {{the well-being of the}} mimicking species. But several of the most striking and most constant facts which have been adduced, directly contradict both those hypotheses. The law that mimicry is confined to a few groups only is one of these, for [...] "similar conditions" [...] must act more or less on all groups in a limited region, and [...] "heredity" [...] must influence all groups related to each other in an equal degree. Again, the general fact that those species which mimic others are rare, while those which are imitated are abundant, is in no way explained by either of these theories, any more than is the frequent occurrence of some palpable mode of protection in the imitated species. [...] "Reversion to an ancestral type" [...] no way explains why the imitator and the imitated always inhabit the very same district, whereas allied forms of every degree of nearness and remoteness generally inhabit different countries, and often different quarters of the globe; and neither it, nor [...] "similar conditions," [...] will account for the likeness between species of distinct groups being superficial only--a disguise, not a true resemblance; for the imitation of bark, of leaves, of sticks, of dung; for the resemblance between species in different orders, and even different classes and sub-kingdoms; and finally, for the <b>graduated</b> <b>series</b> of the phenomena, beginning with a general harmony and adaptation of tint in autumn and winter moths and in arctic and desert animals, and ending with those complete cases of detailed mimicry which not only deceive predacious animals, but puzzle the most experienced insect collectors and the most learned entomologists.|$|E
60|$|Turning to the sheath-horned ruminants: with antelopes a <b>graduated</b> <b>series</b> can be formed, {{beginning}} with species, the females {{of which are}} completely destitute of horns--passing on to those which have horns so small as to be almost rudimentary (as with the Antilocapra americana, in which species they are present in {{only one out of}} four or five females (11. I am indebted to Dr. Canfield for this information; see also his paper in the 'Proceedings of the Zoological Society,' 1866, p. 105.))--to those which have fairly developed horns, but manifestly smaller and thinner than in the male and sometimes of a different shape (12. For instance the horns of the female Ant. euchore resemble those of a distinct species, viz. the Ant. dorcas var. Corine, see Desmarest, 'Mammalogie,' p. 455.),--and ending with those in which both sexes have horns of equal size. As with the reindeer, so with antelopes, there exists, as previously shewn, a relation between the period of the development of the horns and their transmission to one or both sexes; it is therefore probable that their presence or absence in the females of some species, and their more or less perfect condition in the females of other species, depends, not on their being of any special use, but simply on inheritance. It accords with this view that even in the same restricted genus both sexes of some species, and the males alone of others, are thus provided. It is also a remarkable fact that, although the females of Antilope bezoartica are normally destitute of horns, Mr. Blyth has seen no less than three females thus furnished; and {{there was no reason to}} suppose that they were old or diseased.|$|E

60|$|It is {{interesting}} to observe in the above several cases the <b>graduated</b> <b>series</b> from plants which, when fertilised by their own pollen, yield the full number of seeds, but with the seedlings a little dwarfed in stature--to plants which when self-fertilised yield few seeds--to those which yield none, but have their ovaria somewhat developed--and, lastly, to those in which the plant's own pollen and stigma mutually act on one another like poison. It is also interesting to observe on how slight {{a difference in the}} nature of the pollen or of the ovules complete self-sterility or complete self-fertility must depend in some of the above cases. Every individual of the self-sterile species appears to be capable of producing the full complement of seed when fertilised by the pollen of any other individual (though judging from the facts given with respect to Abutilon the nearest kin must be excepted); but not one individual can be fertilised by its own pollen. As every organism differs in some slight degree from every other individual of the same species, so no doubt it is with their pollen and ovules; and in the above cases we must believe that complete self-sterility and complete self-fertility depend on such slight differences in the ovules and pollen, and not their having been differentiated in some special manner in relation to one another; for it is impossible that the sexual elements of many thousand individuals should have been specialised in relation to every other individual. In some, however, of the above cases, as with certain Passifloras, an amount of differentiation between the pollen and ovules sufficient for fertilisation is gained only by employing pollen from a distinct species; but this is probably the result of such plants having been rendered somewhat sterile from the unnatural conditions to which they have been exposed.|$|E
60|$|These hybrids are {{interesting}} under several points of view. First, {{from the number}} found {{in various parts of}} the same moderately-sized field. That they owed their origin to insects flying from flower to flower, whilst collecting pollen, there can be no doubt. Although insects thus rob the flowers of a most precious substance, yet they do great good; for, as I have elsewhere shown, the seedlings of V. thapsus raised from flowers fertilised with pollen from another plant, are more vigorous than those raised from self-fertilised flowers. (2/26. 'The Effects of Cross and Self-fertilisation' 1876 page 89.) But in this particular instance the insects did great harm, as they led to the production of utterly barren plants. Secondly, these hybrids are remarkable from differing much from one another in many of their characters; for hybrids of the first generation, if raised from uncultivated plants, are generally uniform in character. That these hybrids belonged to the first generation we may safely conclude, from the absolute sterility of all those observed by me in a state of nature and of the one plant in my garden, excepting when artificially and repeatedly fertilised with pure pollen, and then the number of seeds produced was extremely small. As these hybrids varied so much, an almost perfectly <b>graduated</b> <b>series</b> of forms, connecting together the two widely distinct parent-species, could easily have been selected. This case, like that of the common oxlip, shows that botanists ought to be cautious in inferring the specific identity of two forms from the presence of intermediate gradations; nor would it be easy in the many cases in which hybrids are moderately fertile to detect a slight degree of sterility in such plants growing in a state of nature and liable to be fertilised by either parent-species. Thirdly and lastly, these hybrids offer an excellent illustration of a statement made by that admirable observer Gartner, namely, that although plants which can be crossed with ease generally produce fairly fertile offspring, yet well-pronounced exceptions to this rule occur; and here we have two species of Verbascum which evidently cross with the greatest ease, but produce hybrids which are excessively sterile.|$|E
60|$|Turning to the sheath-horned ruminants: with antelopes a <b>graduated</b> <b>series</b> can be formed, {{beginning}} with the species, the females of which are completely destitute of horns—passing to those which have horns so small as to be almost rudimentary, as in Antilocapra Americana—to those which have fairly well-developed horns, but manifestly smaller and thinner than in the male, and sometimes of a different shape,[298] and ending with those in which both sexes have horns of equal size. As with the reindeer, so with antelopes there exists a relation between {{the period of the}} development of the horns and their transmission to one or both sexes; it is therefore probable that their presence or absence in the females of some species, and their more or less perfect condition in the females of other species, depend, not on their being of some special use, but simply on the form of inheritance which has prevailed. It accords with this view that even in the same restricted genus both sexes of some species, and the males alone of other species, are thus provided. It is a remarkable fact that, although the females of Antilope bezoartica are normally destitute of horns, Mr. Blyth has seen no less than three females thus furnished; and {{there was no reason to}} suppose that they were old or diseased. The males of this species have long straight spirated horns, nearly parallel to each other, and directed backwards. Those of the female, when present, are very different in shape, for they are not spirated, and spreading widely bend round, so that their points are directed forwards. It is a still more remarkable fact that in the castrated male, as Mr. Blyth informs me, the horns are of the same peculiar shape as in the female, but longer and thicker. In all cases the differences between the horns of the males and females, and of castrated and entire males, probably depend on various causes,—on the more or less complete transference of male characters to the females,—on the former state of the progenitors of the species,—and partly perhaps on the horns being differently nourished, in nearly the same manner as the spurs of the domestic cock, when inserted into the comb or other parts of the body, assume various abnormal forms from being differently nourished.|$|E
