50|$|Implantations of {{the signal}} {{crayfish}} were {{the reason for the}} spread of the disease to United Kingdom and Ireland. Transport of signal crayfish, red swamp crayfish and infected native European freshwater crayfish between waters is the main cause for contamination. Transmission of the disease through items that has been in contact with contaminated water, for example a <b>fishing</b> <b>tool</b> or footwear is also possible. The spores are also sensitive to high or low temperatures. Most authorities have local rules and regulations that the amount of water moved between different waters (in for example a boat) is minimised. It is usually also recommended to only use fishing bait from the same lake when fishing, alternatively freeze it to at least -10 C for one day before use, if risk for contamination exists. The spores of crayfish plague disappear from an infected water system (connected lakes and rivers) in {{a few weeks after the}} last infected crayfish is gone. Reintroduction is then possible, as long as no infected waters are in contact with the lake.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a general three dimensional hydro-elastic {{tool for the}} analysis of different types of fishing nets and aquaculture facilities. Flexible net strands are modeled by non-linear truss elements having two nodes. Hydrodynamic loads due to relative motion of the net with the surrounding fluid are computed using the Morison equation. The coupled hydrodynamic-elastodynamic equations are solved using finite element (FE) approximations. Furthermore, experimental data are presented for the drag resistance of a purse seine net, commonly used as <b>fishing</b> <b>tool</b> in the Mediterranean sea. The measurements were conducted in the towing tank of NTUA on a sample of a net. The net was tested in three configurations: vertical, horizontal and inclined at 451. The derived drag coefficients are compared to predictions of the FEM developed model. The vertical submergence behavior of the seine in calm water is also examined, both experimentally and theoretically. Moreover, the shooting phase of the purse-seine fishing is simulated with the aim to investigate the diving behavior of the net. The flow shading effect of neighboring strands is identified as a critical parameter for the consistent predictions of the diving behavior...|$|E

40|$|Tuna fishing has {{historically}} been based on a complex network of socio-labor interactions involving {{a significant number of}} fishers having a variety of specific functions. Tasks have been divided into three main stages: preparation and deployment of the fishing gear; harvesting activities inside the trap, and dismantling of this impressive <b>fishing</b> <b>tool.</b> The captain emerges as the key figure watching over this wide range of activities, since all the technical tasks necessary for the different stages of the fishing to be properly executed depend on the captain (as well as others, as an intermediary between the company and the crew). His sensorial and intellectual skills and practical learning ability continue to underpin the operation of this centuries-old fishing mode, although the latest changes in the technical and economic organization of blue fin tuna fishing have changed the socio-cultural landscape of the traps. A theoretical reflection is given of the concept of vernacular expertise based on a description of these skills and their historical evolution (18 th century onwards). The analysis focuses on tuna traps on the Andalusian Atlantic coast (SW Spain), and reviews the history of the fishery from the late 18 th century to the present day; i. e., the historical period during which the previous fishing gear, the so-called " mobile " tuna trap (the almadraba de tiro or almadraba de vista (alternative names)) has been replaced by the " static " tuna trap (the almadraba fija or almadraba de buche (alternative names)) ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{observations}} of fishing, the ethnohistoric literature, the archaeological <b>fishing</b> <b>tool</b> kit, marine environments {{adjacent to the}} site, and the fish bone assemblage were considered to understand fishing strategies on the makatea island of Rurutu, Austral Islands, French Polynesia. Excavations totalling 53. 5 m(2) at the Peva dune site (ONI) were conducted in 2003. The sandy, calcareous deposits from Area 2 (33 m(2)) were dry sieved through 3. 2 mm mesh and 5, 011 fish bones weighing 2, 229. 7 g were retained for analysis. Two distinct cultural layers were identified. Archaic period layer D had 20 fish families inventoried from a total of 141 minimum numbers of individuals (MNI) and 1, 081 numbers of identified specimens (NISP). Average bone weight was 0. 42 g and median vertebra width between 5 - 6 mm (n= 747). The Classic period layer A, associated with a marae complex, contained only seven fish families, a MNI of 24 and NISP of 403. Average bone weight was 0. 63 g and median vertebra width between 10 - 11 mm (n= 107). While a broad spectrum fish capture strategy is inferred for the Archaic, selective larger fish, including {{an order of magnitude}} increase in shark, were likely prestige items used in ritual offerings during the Classic period. Comparisons of the archaeological assemblages from five makatea islands show that in all but one case, sites are dominated by groupers, unlike many other Pacific island sites where parrotfish are most frequent. This, alone, might be the unique signature of makatea assemblages...|$|E
40|$|A common {{fear for}} all ice drillers is a stuck drill. A less severe but {{important}} concern is a foreign object in a borehole, deflected borehole or slush formation in a borehole {{filled with an}} ethanol-water solution (EWS). Prevention is {{the most efficient way}} to avoid troublesome situations. However, should these problems arise it is important to be equipped with safe and efficient tools. A stuck drill occurs rather frequently but it is rarely serious. Electro-mechanical (EM) drills usually become stuck due to inefficient chip removal from the kerf. When the drill gets stuck there are several possible actions. The simplest initial approach should be sharp jerks with a reverse rotating core barrel. Many times the Byrd Polar Research Center (BPRC) dry hole EM drill has been successfully recover using this technique. When this technique fails, another solution to the problem is to pour a few liters of auto-antifreeze into the hole using a rubber hose to bypass the upper firn. This usually frees the drill in less than one hour. In 1999 the cable on the BPRC EM drill broke, but we successfully recovered the drill from 110 m depth using 2 ̆ 7 <b>fishing</b> <b>tool</b> 2 ̆ 7. Ethanol thermal drills also experience complications. In order to free a thermal drill when the main heating element has failed, a second heating element can be turned-on by switching the polarity of the power. There are a number of reasons why slush can form and clog a borehole. This paper presents a field proven technique for the EWS concentration correction at any depth in the borehole. Directional drilling (DD) techniques can be used to resume drilling if the drill or foreign object cannot be removed from the borehole. This paper discusses how to recover a drill with a broken cable and describes techniques that may be used to prevent cable suspended drills similar to the BPRC dry hole EM drill from becoming stuck. The paper discusses how to maintain the correct EWS concentration and general drill design safety options...|$|E
