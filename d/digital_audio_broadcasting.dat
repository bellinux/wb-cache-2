2500|$|It {{can explain}} how a sharp clap {{of the hands}} might seem painfully loud in a quiet library, but is hardly {{noticeable}} after a car backfires on a busy, urban street. [...] This provides great benefit to the overall compression ratio, and psychoacoustic analysis routinely leads to compressed music files that are 1/10th to 1/12th the size of high quality masters, but with discernibly less proportional quality loss. Such compression is a feature of nearly all modern lossy audio compression formats. Some of these formats include Dolby Digital (AC-3), MP3, Opus, Ogg Vorbis, AAC, WMA, MPEG-1 Layer II (used for <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>broadcasting</b> in several countries) and ATRAC, the compression used in MiniDisc and some Walkman models.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{increased}} rollout of <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> (DAB) between 1995 and 2002, BBC Radio launched several new digital-only stations BBC 1Xtra, BBC 6 Music and BBC 7 in 2002 on 16 August, 11 March and 15 December respectively — the first for [...] "new black British music", the second {{as a source}} of performance-based [...] "alternative" [...] music, the latter specialising in archive classic comedy shows, drama and children's programmes. BBC Asian Network joined the national DAB network on 28 October 2002. The stations have since been renamed to include the BBC Radio brand, to BBC Radio 1Xtra, BBC Radio 6 Music, and BBC Radio 7. In 2011, BBC Radio 7 was renamed BBC Radio 4 Extra as the service was brought more into line with BBC Radio 4.|$|E
30|$|Due to {{its high}} data rate {{transmission}} capability and its robustness to multipath delay spread, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been adopted {{in most parts of}} modern wireless communication systems, such as wireless local area networks [1], <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> and video <b>broadcasting</b> [2], and so is OFDM being standardized for the future wireless communication systems, such as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access [3] and 3 GPP’s Long-Term Evolution [4]. However, OFDM is known to be very sensitive to radio frequency front-end imperfections such as carrier frequency offset (CFO), in-phase and quadrature-phase (IQ) imbalance and phase noise. These imperfections, if not properly estimated and compensated, will severely degrade the performance of OFDM systems. CFO and IQ imbalance are constant over an OFDM symbol period and have widely been investigated and well solved in the literature [5 – 8]. However, unlike the constant CFO and IQ imbalance, phase noise is a stochastic process during an OFDM symbol period and therefore causes a greater challenging problem. This is because each OFDM sample in an OFDM symbol period suffers from different phase noise.|$|R

On the other hand, with high-speed railway construction worldwide, the moving speed of high-speed train has been reported to be able to operate as high as more than 400 km/h, or, even higher on-board high-speed vehicles such as aircraft. Consequently, mobility support is widely {{regarded as one of the}} key features in the above-mentioned OFDM systems. Meanwhile, for coherent detection in a wireless communication system, channel state information is indispensable. Therefore, to ensure effective communication of OFDM systems operating in high speed scenarios or alternatively very fast time-varying wireless channels, channel estimation method applicable to such high-speed environments has remained largely an open issue.|$|R

Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a powerful technique for high data-rate transmission over fading channels. However, to deploy OFDM in a WLAN environment, precise frequency synchronization must be maintained and tricky frequency offsets must be handled. In this thesis, various techniques to improve the data throughput of OFDM WLAN are investigated. A simulation tool was developed in Matlab to evaluate the performance of the IEEE 802. 11 a physical layer. We proposed a rapid time and frequency synchronization algorithm using only the short training sequence of the IEEE 802. 11 a standard, thus reducing the training overhead to 50 %. Particular attention was paid to channel coding, block interleaving and antenna diversity. Computer simulation showed that drastic improvement in error rate performance is achievable when these techniques are deployed. Lieutenant, Hellenic Nav...|$|R

40|$|Several {{factors have}} to be {{analyzed}} before designing an appropriate communication system for in-theatre IR multi-channel <b>audio</b> <b>broadcasting.</b> The infrared channel characteristics for the in-theatre propagation environment are examined and a suitable IR transmission configuration is suggested. The free-space IR transmission has a simple channel model which simplifies the analysis. The CD <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> technology which provides advanced digital signal processing techniques at a relatively low cost is a strong candidate {{for use in the}} system. However, the channel coding used in the CD system (known as EFM) has a high redundancy which results in a performance degradation. A more suitable channel coding scheme (which is a version of 8 B 10 B channel modulation) is designed and simple implementations for the corresponding coder and decoder are given. The receiver design for an indoor non-directional IR communication system requires an approach different from that commonly employed in optical fibre communications. A signal-to-noise ratio analysis is carried out and a simple strategy for the receiver design is proposed. A link power budget calculation is performed to find the required transmitted optical power. Also, it is shown analog FM requires much higher transmitted optical power to provide the performance achieved by the CD-based <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> system in the in-theatre IR <b>audio</b> <b>broadcasting.</b> Finally, a simulation is carried out to investigate the effects of the multipath dispersion on the performance of the system...|$|R

40|$|Multi-carrier direct-sequence code {{division}} multiple access (MC-DS-CDMA) technique, which is a combination of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and {{code division}} multiple accesses (CDMA), has been considered as an important technique for the future generation wireless systems due to its bandwidth efficiency, frequency diversity, and immunity to channel dispersion. OFDM has already been employed in many areas, such as <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> and video <b>broadcasting,</b> wireless local/metropolitan area networks, and asynchronous digital subscriber lines (ADSL). Leveraging the multiple access capability of CDMA, the MC-DS-CDMA technique is an important enhancement to OFDM. Nevertheless, a major disadvantage of the MC-DS-CDMA systems is their high sensitivity to timing errors between transmitter and receiver due to the use {{of a large number of}} carriers and the superposition of signals of multiple users. In this thesis, we study the bit error rate (BER) performance of MC-DS-CDMA system under the effects of timing jitter in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and multi-path Rayleigh fading channel, respectively. In particular, we have derived the analytical BER expressions for the MC-DS-CDMA signals in presence of white or colored timing jitters and verified the results via computer simulations...|$|R
