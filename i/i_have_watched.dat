25|$|At {{three o'clock}} p.m. on Monday at St. George's Mortuary, Dr. Blackwell and I made a post mortem examination. Rigor mortis was still {{thoroughly}} marked. There was mud {{on the left}} side of the face and it was matted in the head. The body was fairly nourished. Over both shoulders, especially the right, and under the collarbone and in front of the chest there was a bluish discoloration, which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> and have seen on two occasions since.|$|E
500|$|His second {{defense was}} against Neil Sinclair in Yorkshire, Great Britain. In {{the first round}} Sinclair's {{offensive}} was effective and he scored a knockdown on the defending champion. On the second round Santos responded to Sinclair's strategy and won the fight by knockout. Prior to the fight Sinclair noted that a fight between Santos and him was supposed to happen eight years before, [...] "We were both in the 1992 World junior championships in Montreal. We were {{both at the same}} weight and were at other side of the draw from each other and ended up with bronze medals. So <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> him fight in person and shook hands on the podium. If we had both won our semi-finals we would have faced each other." [...] Sinclair also stated that he expected to win based on his training, he said that all of his sparring partners were southpaws since Santos is one, this preparation also included contracting a new trainer.|$|E
500|$|He was {{pitted against}} Bill O'Reilly, the leg spinner {{regarded}} as the best bowler in the world, and Ray Lindwall, an emerging bowler of express pace, the fastest in Australia. Miller accumulated slowly and was on 74 as Services limped to 9/171. Services had no batsmen left with one man injured and retired hurt, so O'Reilly allowed the twelfth man to bat, {{in order to give}} Miller a chance of making a century. Miller attacked and scored 31 of the last 33 runs, ending with an unbeaten 105, with 11 fours in 172 minutes. He earned plaudits among cricket pundits on Australian soil. Former leading Test batsman Alan Kippax opined that [...] "Australia has unearthed a new champion", claiming that he was finer than Jack Gregory and saying that [...] "few batsmen <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> have had his ability to blend beauty and power". O'Reilly said that Miller's century was [...] "one of the best hundreds ever got against me". Miller compiled 46 in the second innings before being bowled by O'Reilly as the Servicemen fell to another innings defeat. Miller finished the season with 2/74 and 4/49 in a drawn match against Queensland and a pair of fifties in a drawn match against Tasmania. Miller ended the season with 463 runs at 57.88 and six wickets at 31.83.|$|E
50|$|Modern Afrikaans also lacks a pluperfect (e.g. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>watched).</b> Instead, the pluperfect, {{like the}} preterite, is {{expressed}} using the perfect.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{noticed that}} delicious rhythmic, breathing. Each morning <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>watched</b> the sea-breeze {{begin at the}} shore and slowly extend seaward as it blew the mildest, softest whiff of ozone to the land. It played over the sea, just faintly darkening its surface, with {{here and there and}} {{everywhere}} long lanes of calm, shifting, changing, drifting, according to the capricious kisses of the breeze. And each evening <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>watched</b> the sea breath die away to heavenly calm, and heard the land breath softly make its way through the coffee trees and monkey-pods.|$|R
60|$|Briefly I {{told her}} what <b>had</b> {{happened}} before <b>I</b> entered her room, not omitting a terse word as {{to the character of}} the men <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>watched.</b>|$|R
2500|$|After the game, the umpire, Allen of Chicago, {{was asked}} {{what he thought of}} the Michigan team and responded: [...] "Why, {{it goes without saying that}} Michigan is a wonder. It is the {{greatest}} team I ever saw, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> a lot of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Haye then {{confirmed}} {{that he would}} meet the WBA champion Nikolay Valuev (50-1, 34 KOs) on 7 November 2009 in the Nuremberg Arena, Nuremberg, Germany. Haye's former trainer Adam Booth claimed it was a fight that Valuev wanted; it was billed as David and Goliath. Haye weighed in at 217pounds, almost 100pounds less than his opponent. Haye said about Valuev: [...] "He is the ugliest thing I have ever seen. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> Lord of the Rings and films with strange-looking people, but for a human being to look like he does is pretty shocking." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{military}} men had another difficult time against New South Wales, as their opponents made 7/551 declared, with Test batsman Sid Barnes scoring a century. Apart from Miller, the Services batsmen struggled. Miller reached 74 as Services limped to 9/171. Services had no batsmen left with Pettiford injured and retired hurt, so O'Reilly allowed the twelfth man to Workman to be substituted in {{and allowed to}} bat, {{in order to give}} Miller a chance of making a century. Miller attacked and scored 31 of the last 33 runs, ending with an unbeaten 105, with 11 fours in 172 minutes. He earned plaudits among cricket pundits on Australian soil. Former leading Test batsman Alan Kippax opined that [...] "Australia has unearthed a new champion", claiming that he was finer than Jack Gregory and saying that [...] "few batsmen <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> have had his ability to blend beauty and power". O'Reilly said that Miller's century was [...] "one of the best hundreds ever got against me". The Services were forced to follow on and were bowled out for 339 to fall to another innings defeat. The Services struggled against the leg spin of Colin McCool, who took 11 wickets in a drawn match against Queensland. The hosts were 5/186 in pursuit of 190 for victory when time ran out and saved Hassett's team. In the final match against Tasmania, the Services came as close as they would to a victory on Australian soil. After taking a 97-run first innings lead, they set Tasmania 292 [...] for victory and the hosts held on for a draw with only wicket in hand. They were 9/166 when time ran out.|$|E
60|$|In {{the end we}} {{went back}} to Stephano's. We sat at the table at which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> so often <b>watched</b> Eve and her father sitting alone, and by her side I listened to the music <b>I</b> <b>had</b> so often heard while <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>watched</b> her from what had {{seemed to me to be}} an {{impossible}} distance.|$|R
6000|$|... "At first <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>watched</b> {{these men}} with a mere curiosity, but when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen they meant {{to come to the}} temple I was moved to forbid them. I shouted to the officer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not? She is {{my flesh}} and blood. She is more dear {{to me than}} {{anything}} else. Perhaps if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>watched</b> over her more closely, things would have been different." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} been {{watching}} him so long for nothing,' returned Nadgett. 'I never watched a man so close as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not {{even though}} the mem-log--the white women of thy own blood--love thee? And remember, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> them driving in the evening; they are very fair.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do I not know?" [...] he asked. [...] "The gods always win. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> men {{play for}} years {{what seemed a}} winning game. In the end they lost." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Please forgive me! Indeed, I {{could not}} help it. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>watched</b> and watched, and nothing happened; and somehow my {{vigilance}} relaxed when I found nothing was likely {{to take place in}} the star.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{look like}} all happy men, very ridiculous," [...] said Mrs. Tristram. [...] "It's the usual thing, neither better nor worse. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been <b>watching</b> {{you for the}} last ten minutes, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been <b>watching</b> M. de Bellegarde. He doesn't like it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> stepped {{underneath}} the open hatchway so that I could see him. The lack of {{expression on his}} face, so different from when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>watched</b> him unseen, was enhanced by the unblinking, staring eyes. It was not a pleasant face to look upon.|$|R
6000|$|... “You {{are cool}} when my lord is drunk,” Harry continued; “your lordship gets {{the better of}} my patron. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> you as I looked up from my books.” ...|$|E
60|$|Adrian. I am true as Heaven to thee, poor lady. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> above thee and can save. Here, here is {{the ring}} thou knowest; ah, do not doubt me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are cool}} when my lord is drunk," [...] Harry continued; [...] "your lordship gets {{the better of}} my patron. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> you as I looked up from my books." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} when I went back, my fears were realised: the door was refused to me--my Lady was not at home. This I knew to be false: <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>watched</b> the door the whole morning from a lodging I took at a house opposite.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Darling Henrietta,' lowly breathed the enraptured lover, 'best, and sweetest, and loveliest of women, your Ferdinand, at that moment, was {{not less}} moved than you were. Speechless and pale <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>watched</b> my Henrietta, and I felt that I beheld the being to whom I must {{dedicate}} my existence.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>HAVE</b> been <b>watching</b> {{machinery}} in repose {{after reading}} about machinery in action.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{understand}} {{it in the}} least," [...] said the policeman, [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> carefully, and I know Jim Crow has never dared to come near to your trees." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have eaten}} your bread and salt, [...] I have drunk your water and wine, The deaths ye died <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> beside, [...] And the lives that ye led were mine.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite true; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> him {{content with}} the level my impertinent {{children}} assign him here, but now trying to be manly for Essie's sake. You have not told me of Sydney." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} {{plotting}} {{to take away}} from me the lady Heddana who to me is as mother and sister and child. It is useless to lie to me, for the Master has told me all; moreover, I knew it for myself, both through my Spirit and because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>watched</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could hardly}} have ventured on taking those two girls to town unless you had broken them in a little. I would say nothing last night till <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>watched</b> Susan; for my mother is particular, and if my wife was to be always {{worrying}} herself about their manners, they had better be at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, rather, <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> <b>watched,</b> but my treacherous eyes betrayed me; twice <b>have</b> <b>I</b> proved myself {{unfit for}} the trust I bear." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have eaten}} your bread and salt, [...] I have drunk your water and wine, [...] The deaths ye died <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> beside, [...] And the lives that ye led were mine.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know," [...] said Torfrida. [...] "I {{have read}} {{of such things}} in books of the ancients, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> them making continually,--I little knew why, or that I should ever turn engineer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not comely, at least, {{to confess}} their love to men. But {{she has never}} done that, Amyas; not even by a look or a tone of voice, though <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> her for months." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! you'll get through. You {{have a way}} {{of going}} on. But <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> to <b>watch</b> over you. I see <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> to <b>watch</b> over you. Tell me of the things you mean to do. Where are you standing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|There was {{something}} unusually {{still in the}} evening ... a stillness as of waiting. It set me thinking of the last time Mr. Lawrence had been ill ... nearly {{a year ago in}} August. One night during his convalescence <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>watched</b> by him to relieve the nurse. He had been sleepless and talkative, telling me many things about his life. Finally he told me of Margaret.|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>watched</b> {{the noble}} fight which the great warrior {{had put up}} against such {{enormous}} odds my heart had swelled in admiration for him, and acting as I am wont to do, more upon impulse than after mature deliberation, I instantly sprang from my sheltering rock and bounded quickly toward {{the bodies of the}} dead green Martians, a well-defined plan of action already formed.|$|R
