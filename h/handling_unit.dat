25|$|By late April 1945, {{a number}} of AA units were deemed surplus to requirements. The {{regiment}} was ordered to concentrate at Hoogerheide on 23 April and come {{under the command of}} 76th AA Bde, which was <b>handling</b> <b>unit</b> disbandments and conversions to other roles. 103rd HAA Rgt was converted into a driver training unit, for which it was joined by 64th HAA Rgt's REME workshop. The first intake of potential drivers arrived just before VE Day. The regiment passed to 50th AA Bde shortly afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Olson, {{who had an}} {{extensive}} criminal history, was arrested on August 12, 1981, on suspicion of attempts to abduct two girls. By August 25, Olson {{had been charged with}} the murder of Judy Kozma. He reached a controversial deal with authorities, agreeing to confess to the 11 murders and show the RCMP the location of the bodies of those not yet recovered. In return, authorities agreed that $10,000 for each victim was paid into a trust for his wife, Joan, and then-infant son, Clifford III. His wife received $100,000 after Olson cooperated with the RCMP, the 11th body being a 'freebie'. In January 1982, Olson pleaded guilty to 11 counts of murder and was given as many concurrent life sentences to be served in Canada's super-maximum security Special <b>Handling</b> <b>Unit</b> in Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec, which houses many of the country's most dangerous criminals. Olson was a dangerous offender, meaning it was very unlikely he would ever have been released from prison.|$|E
500|$|The next {{task was}} to remove and replace the telescope's Science Instrument Command and Data <b>Handling</b> <b>Unit,</b> or SIC, a {{computer}} that sends commands to Hubble's science instruments, and formats science data for transmission to the ground. This was the item that failed in September 2008, delaying STS-125 while engineers prepared a replacement part for the mission, and the crew trained for the new task. While {{the failure of the}} SIC did not disable the telescope, replacing the unit restores the redundancies. The final major {{task was to}} install the Soft-Capture Mechanism (SCM), which includes the [...] Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) that will allow spacecraft in the future to dock with the telescope, and to safely de-orbit the telescope {{at the end of its}} life. Feustel also installed two of four Latch Over Center Kits, or LOCKs, that make opening and closing Hubble's large access doors easier for the remaining spacewalks. The spacewalk officially ended at 20:12 UTC, for a time of seven hours and twenty minutes. It was the nineteenth spacewalk devoted to servicing the telescope, and brought the total time in servicing Hubble to one hundred thirty-six hours, thirty minutes. Due to the length of the spacewalk, and the delay in beginning, the crew was over an hour behind their scheduled timeline for the day, but worked through the post-EVA activities and evening activities without problems, and got to sleep only slightly behind their scheduled time. During the mission status briefing, David Leckrone, Hubble Project Senior Scientist, noted he was very relieved that the camera was replaced successfully, and noted that the problems with the bolt caused some concern, [...] "I don't normally reveal my age and I'm not going to here, but I can tell you I'm five years older now than I was when I came to work this morning, we can sleep pretty well tonight, knowing that's been accomplished." ...|$|E

The paper will be summarizing the measurements of configuration for air <b>handling</b> <b>units</b> with air-to-air heat exchangers. The research carried out analytical studies analyzing an optimum variant of the energy savings with regard to different type of the air-to-air heat exchangers and their technical performances. The results show that basic methods of air <b>handling</b> <b>unit’s</b> optimization should be encouraged due to the potential of energy savings in Latvia’s residential area. Reduction of energy consumption, improvement of energy efficiency and optimization of air <b>handling</b> <b>units</b> for the residential area are important issues to address the improvement of indoor air quality...|$|R

40|$|The European Union (EU) energy {{consumption}} is growing each year, {{and along with}} their dependencies on external oil and gas suppliers. EU buildings consume 40 % of the total {{energy consumption}} in Europe. Predicts {{that by the year}} 2020, two times increase in energy consumption of air handling systems, and it should be limited to the higher standards for air <b>handling</b> <b>units.</b> Using counter flow heat exchanger in the ventilation system, it will reduce considerably heat energy consumption of ventilation, but the same time create pressure loses. The paper presents analysis of using double by-pass in the air <b>handling</b> <b>units.</b> In the article will be represented possible air flows and pressure reduction models of air <b>handling</b> <b>units</b> with double by-pass of counter flow heat exchangers.

50|$|It is very {{important}} to design the interface between the MES and the MRP\ERP properly: the reporting of the consumed quantities has to be processed consistently, in the right order, in other words all the recorded/reported consumptions from a <b>handling</b> <b>unit</b> should be issued in the ERP before issuing the <b>handling</b> <b>unit</b> as empty. Otherwise a large number of false errors would get into the error-backlog because the book inventory is already zero as a consequence of issuing the <b>handling</b> <b>unit</b> as being empty before issuing all the consumption which refer to that specific <b>handling</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
