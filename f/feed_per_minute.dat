40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} four deferral periods for pastures of Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk, {{and the implications}} on the ingestive behavior of crossbred heifers. Animals were distributed in a completely randomized design with four periods (63, 84, 105 and 126 days), each with three replications. The time spent daily by animals on grazing, idle, rumination and in the trough was not affected by periods of sealing the pastures, with mean values of 566. 6; 422. 29; 426. 9 and 24. 1 minutes, respectively. The number of feeding stations, the {{time spent in the}} stations and the number of <b>feeding</b> stations <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> were not different between periods of sealing the pastures, averaging 106. 4; 34. 6 and 3. 0, respectively. The number of bites and the number of bites <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> showed a quadratic effect, with a point of maximum equal to 1, 098 bites and 31 bites <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> observed on days 93 and 88, respectively. Feed efficiency was linearly decreasing influenced by periods of sealing the pastures. Periods of grazing and idle, the number of bites, the number of bites <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> and <b>feed</b> efficiency are influenced by different deferral periods of pastures under the conditions of this study...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePopulation {{parameters}} and behaviour of the herbivorous fish Sarpa salpa, present differences between protected and non-protected seagrass meadows of the north-western Mediterranean Sea. Larger individuals are more abundant inside protected areas, where their grazing pressure on seagrass is disproportionately {{greater than that}} of smaller fish feeding on algae and seagrass in unprotected areas. The <b>feeding</b> rate (bites <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> <b>per</b> individual) of smaller fish in unprotected areas is relatively high; however, the denser populations of larger fish in protected areas consume more forage because individual mouth gape is greater and larger fish remove more forage per bite. All these differences suggest a higher impact on seagrass meadows inside protected areas...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate behavior patterns of heifers grazing on black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb.) and ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), fed supplementation with brown rice meal and/or protected fat. A total of 28 Charolais × Nellore crossbred heifers at average initial age of 18 months and with initial live weight of 274. 9 ± 4. 97 kg were used in the experiment. Animals were kept in oat + ryegrass pastures and distributed in the following treatments: no supplementation; Megalac (MEG) : protected fat supplementation; supplementation with brown rice meal (BRM); and supplementation with BRM + MEG. The neutral detergent fiber (NDF) intake of pasture either in kg or in percentage of live weight was not changed by supply of supplement, but increased linearly (0. 045 kg per day) over grazing periods. Supplementation with BRM and BRM + MEG reduced grazing time, 49. 63 %, in relation to non-supplemented animals and animals supplemented with MEG, 63. 13 %. <b>Feeding</b> seasons <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> increased over the experimental period with reduction in time spent in each feeding station. The number of bites <b>per</b> <b>feeding</b> station decreased linearly, with a variation of 34. 48 % in the late grazing period. Heifers supplemented with BRM and BRM + MEG require less time for grazing and increase their idle time, with no modification in displacement patterns within the paddocks and pasture ingestion. Grazing and idle time does not change in the distinct periods of pasture use, but rumination time increases with days of pasture use and with increase in NDF intake...|$|R

40|$|It was {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} two rest intervals between grazing occupations in rotational grazing; 375 and 750 DD (degree-days); based on the cumulative thermal sum necessary for leaf expansion of native grasses of two functional groups over the grazing behavior variables from beef heifers with 12 months old. The experiment was conducted as a completely randomized block design, with two treatments, three replications and measures repeated over time. Grazing behavior was assessed in three occasions (Nov 2011, Jan and Mar 2012), with 24 h each. The herbage intake was estimated using an external marker (Cr 2 O 3). The leaf mass was similar among the rest intervals, {{with a mean of}} 1261 kg DM ha- 1. The average grazing time was 627. 4 min day- 1 and bite rate was 37. 1 bites min- 1. The average number of daily meals was 5. 9 with an average of 118. 5 minutes.

40|$|The Quartz Melt Rate Furnace (QMRF) was {{developed}} to study the melt rate and offgas composition of simulated Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) melter feed. The objective of this testing was to evaluate whether the apparatus {{could be used to}} study the offgas chemistry of melting batches and perform small-scale slurry-fed melt rate tests. The furnace was tested in three different configurations: a dry-fed test with offgas analysis, a slurry-fed test without offgas analysis, and a slurry-fed test with offgas analysis. During the dry-fed test, offgas composition was successfully measured throughout the run and total offgas flow was calculated from the helium tracer concentration. During the slurry-feeding tests without offgas analysis, the furnace exhibited stable feeding behavior with no problems with feed tube pluggage. Feeding behavior was used to measure the melt rate of Sludge Batch 3 with Frit 320 and with Frit 418. Both frits had approximately the same melt rate during the tests based on amount of melter <b>feed</b> added <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> During the slurry-fed test with offgas analysis, spikes in the data prevented overall offgas flow analysis from the helium tracer, but the ratio of different offgas species allowed the composition data to be compared between runs. Minor improvements were identified that would enhance the performance of the furnace and further testing should be performed to optimize the performance of the apparatus. These tests should focus on increasing the stability of offgas composition data by providing more surge capacity in the offgas system, determining the sensitivity of the furnace to melt rate during slurry-fed tests and refining the lid heat power to optimize melt rate measurements, and to develop the capability to utilize the system with radioactive feeds...|$|R
