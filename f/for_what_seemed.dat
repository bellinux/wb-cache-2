25|$|During {{this time}} Nur ad-Din was {{busy in the}} north, {{fighting}} the Ortoqids, and in 1170 he had to settle a dispute between his nephews when his brother Qutb ad-Din died. After conquering Egypt, Nur ad-Din believed that he had accomplished his goal of uniting the Muslim states, but Saladin {{did not wish to}} be subject to his authority. He did not participate in the invasions led by Nur ad-Din against Jerusalem in 1171 and 1173, hoping that the crusader kingdom would act as a buffer state between Egypt and Syria. Nur ad-Din realized that he had created a dangerous opponent in Saladin, and the two rulers assembled their armies <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> to be the inevitable war.|$|E
25|$|Word {{had spread}} through the East Side, by some magic of terror, that the plant of the Triangle Waist Company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped. Horrified and helpless, the crowds — I among them — {{looked up at the}} burning building, saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows, pause for a terrified moment, and then leap to the {{pavement}} below, to land as mangled, bloody pulp. This went on <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> a ghastly eternity. Occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and, screaming with clothing and hair ablaze, plunged like a living torch to the street. Life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies.|$|E

25|$|The D.C. United {{goal was}} under a nearly-constant, {{withering}} assault almost the entire match, but Hamid made one spectacular save after another to keep the match scoreless until the 69th minute. That's when referee {] showed Hamid a straight red card, after the goalie had come out to defend a breakaway by Red Bulls' striker Kenny Cooper and either {{did or did not}} initiate contact with Cooper. An irate Hamid was replaced by back-up 'keeper Joe Willis, who would carve his name into the team's annals and the hearts of United fans forever. Cooper beat Willis on the spot kick, beat referee Geiger ordered a retake because of encroachment by two Red Bulls players. Willis confidently dove left and blocked Cooper's second attempt. United was forced to play short-handed for a short time, but a reckless tackle against Pontius by the Red Bulls' Rafa Marquez earned a second yellow card and ejection. Shortly before stoppage time, D.C. went ahead, as a deft pass by defender Robbie Russell found Nick DeLeon. who slipped the ball over the sliding New York goalkeeper <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> to be the series winning goal. However, the Red Bulls had an excellent opportunity to force extra-time as they lined up a free kick {{on the edge of the}} penalty area during stoppage time. Despite having one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, Thierry Henry, who was also one of the great set-piece takers, the Red Bulls players decided to let Miller take the kick, and he sent it over the net. United left New Jersey with a 2-1 aggregate score series victory.|$|E
500|$|Critic Paul Henry Lang, among others, lamented Copland's [...] "yield to the conformism of 12-tone music." [...] As serial and serial-inspired {{music was}} {{considered}} more academically viable than music utilizing common practice tonality (especially in Europe), some contemporary critics felt that Copland {{was trying to}} retain his place {{at the apex of}} the American classical music scene by conforming to [...] "academic standards." [...] Taruskin suggests that it might have appeared to these critics that Copland [...] "had sacrificed his hard-won, well-nigh unique public appeal <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>seemed...</b> an 'alienated' modernist stance." [...] As the composer {{had been one of the}} first American composers to import the style from Europe—in the mid twenties—these critics may have overlooked the possibility that his [...] "populist period" [...] may have represented the more jarring deviation in his compositional style.|$|E

2500|$|Chad made {{military}} preparations <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> to be {{an attempt}} to retake Aouzou. Instead, encouraged by the United States, which supplied satellite intelligence, the FANT attacked Maaten al-Sarra on September 5, taking the Libyans by surprise, and apparently the French as well, who reacted by refusing to provide intelligence or logistic support. [...] Djamous's troops were careful to follow the wadis, thus not exposing themselves, and they also took advantage of careless Libyan patrolling and security, intending to take the airbase's garrison and its defenders by surprise. To confuse the Libyans, the FANT forces first proceeded north and northwest in Libyan territory, then turned east and descended upon Maaten al-Sarra; as a result, the Libyan officers took them for reinforcements and attempted to join them.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to submit {{two of his}} compositions to Spector: [...] "Don't Worry Baby" [...] and [...] "Don't Hurt My Little Sister"; both written with the Ronettes in mind.

Harry Nilsson wrote [...] "This Could Be the Night" [...] (1966) {{as a tribute to}} Wilson, with production helmed by Spector. Modern Folk Quartet's Henry Diltz recalled Wilson at the studio during the sessions: [...] "we could see him in the recording booth, in his robe and slippers, sitting there playing our song over and over, <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> like hours". Wilson deemed it one of Nilsson's very best compositions and one of Spector's best productions, explaining [...] "Well, the idea they've been dating and waiting and finally they made love… I love that message." ...|$|E
2500|$|Significantly, {{the foreign}} companies, despite the large {{value of their}} contracts, are only {{required}} to recycle 20 percent of the waste that they collect; the remaining 80 percent are placed into landfills. In contrast, the Zabbaleen recycle up to 80 {{percent of all the}} MSW that they collect. The foreign companies collected the trash from garbage bins placed at central collection points on the streets. However, many inhabitants of Cairo preferred the door-to-door garbage pick-up done by the Zabbaleen, especially because the bins were not plentifully located or located in inconvenient places. Thus, residents expressed their discontent with the new system, especially because they were being charged more <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> to be a more inconvenient system. Under the new system, residents were required to pay a monthly bill for garbage collection that accompanies their electricity bill. The garbage collection fee was based upon the percentage of each electricity bill so that the garbage collection fee increases proportionately to electricity consumption. Two years after the new system was imposed, Rashed writes in the Al-Ahram Weekly, [...] "residents of the governorate have been voicing increasingly vociferous complaints that the companies are working well below full capacity. The streets are not as clean as they were during the first days of the privatisation. Both company workers, and garbage receptacles, appear to be increasingly thin on the ground." ...|$|E
