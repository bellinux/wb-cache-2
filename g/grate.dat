5|$|In August 1649 {{a wooden}} {{staircase}} {{was built to}} the outside wall of the tower and an open iron fire <b>grate</b> affixed to the top. Originally it was planned to burn coal in the lighthouse, but due to high transport costs of coal, wood was used instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} plant uses Babcock & Wilcox Volund boilers {{to provide}} steam {{for a single}} Ansaldo turbo generator rated at 19.2MW. The third line uses a Von Roll Inova reciprocating <b>grate</b> to burn the waste, and generates electricity using a single Von Roll Inova three-pass steam generator, rated at 10MW.|$|E

5|$|The {{final two}} {{locomotives}} Nos. 6256 and 46257 Sir William A. Stanier, F.R.S and City of Salford were given many new features. In order {{to raise the}} mileage between general overhauls from 70,000 to 100,000, measures were taken to decrease wear to the axle bearings and hornguides {{through the use of}} roller bearings and manganese steel linings. Other modifications included further superheating area, a redesigned rear frame and cast steel trailing truck, rocking <b>grate,</b> hopper ashpan and redesigned cab-sides.|$|E
5|$|From the hoppers, {{the waste}} falls onto the furnace-charging chute {{and from there}} onto the incinerating <b>grate.</b> Here it is burned at a {{temperature}} in excess of 1,200°C. This heat is then converted into super heated steam through the plant's boilers. This in turn powers steam turbines, much {{in the same way}} as a conventional thermal power station. Electricity is generated at 11 kilovolts. After exiting the turbines, the steam is condensed back to water. For the original two incinerating lines use river water from the Tees as a cooling medium, whereas in the third line, water is condensed through air cooled condenser. The cooled water is treated and reused in the boilers.|$|E
5|$|In September 1954, Monroe began filming Billy Wilder's comedy The Seven Year Itch, {{in which}} she starred {{opposite}} Tom Ewell {{as a woman who}} becomes the object of her married neighbor's sexual fantasies. Although the film was shot in Hollywood, the studio decided to generate advance publicity by staging the filming of a scene on Lexington Avenue in New York. In the shoot, Monroe is standing on a subway <b>grate</b> with the air blowing up the skirt of her white dress, which {{became one of the most}} famous scenes of her career. The shoot lasted for several hours and attracted a crowd of nearly 2,000 spectators, including professional photographers.|$|E

50|$|To clean a <b>grated</b> trench drain, the <b>grates</b> on top must be removed. This can be {{difficult}} or frustrating if the <b>grates</b> are stuck, or tools are needed to pull them up. If {{it is a long}} run trench drain, it is time consuming to remove the trench drain <b>grates</b> and put them back after cleaning. Slot drain can be cleaned by moving along a cleaning paddle to move the sediment into a catch basin.|$|R

5|$|On August 19, 1953, a burned crewman {{talks to}} three {{government}} agents about his {{experience on the}} submarine Zeus Faber, completing the story told in the previous episode. He explains that he and other crew members were locked in with their captain, who was infected by the black oil. After being knocked out from behind, the black oil leaves the captain's body and exits via a <b>grate</b> into the sea. It is revealed that Bill Mulder and the Smoking Man {{are two of the}} agents who are interviewing the crewman.|$|E
5|$|The M7 tank {{locomotive}} was {{the first}} design by Dugald Drummond upon replacing William Adams as Locomotive Superintendent of the LSWR in 1895. It was an enlargement of the T1 with a sloping <b>grate</b> of increased area giving greater power. Drummond drew upon his previous experience with the successful London Brighton and South Coast Railway D1 class, whilst he was works manager at Brighton in the early 1870s, and his own 157 class of 1877, on the North British Railway in Scotland. It was the heaviest 0-4-4 type ever to run in Britain.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} unusual {{features}} of the design: {{the first of which}} was the setting of the crank axles at 135°, rather than the standard 90° of other locomotive types. This design necessitated four sets of valve gear, and gave rise to eight beats per revolution, rather than the usual four, designed to give a more even draw on the fire and less chance of wheelslip when starting. The second difference was that fire <b>grate</b> was in two sections, the rear portion was horizontal and the front sloped away sharply.|$|E
50|$|Adding {{chromium}} <b>grates</b> with sub-wavelength spacings bent incoming red {{or green}} light waves enough that they could enter and propagate inside the block. On {{the opposite side of}} the block, another set of <b>grates</b> allowed light to exit, angled away from its original direction. The spacing of the exit <b>grates</b> was different from that of the entrance <b>grates,</b> bending incident light so that external light could not enter the block from that side. Around 30 times more light passed through in the forward direction than in reverse. The intervening blocks reduced the need for precise alignment of the two <b>grates</b> with respect to each other.|$|R
5000|$|If the <b>grates</b> on {{the drain}} deteriorate, {{accidents}} could happen when a forklift or other heavy vehicle drives on it. The <b>grates</b> would break and may cause injury. There {{are very strong}} <b>grates</b> can sustain heavy weights but they could be very expensive. The slot concept was first introduced to solve such problems. If there is no <b>grates,</b> there is no concern about breaking. The concrete sustains most of the weight and the slot opening is usually only 0.5" [...] to 1.5".|$|R
50|$|Gremolata usually {{includes}} <b>grated</b> lemon peel, {{although the}} zest from other citrus fruits (lime, orange, grapefruit, etc.) may be used. There are also other variations, such as leaving out the herbs (parsley, cilantro/coriander, mint, sage) or the feature (garlic, finely <b>grated</b> fresh horseradish, minced shallot) or adding another item (Pecorino Romano cheese, anchovy, toasted pine nuts, <b>grated</b> bottarga).|$|R

5|$|A {{storm in}} June 2011 caused public {{utilities}} including the Briarcliff library and Law Memorial Park's public pool and playing fields to be flooded. When Trump had renovated the course, his workers made unauthorized changes to its drainage system, {{which made the}} course look and play better for golfers. The alterations lowered the system's water capacity and thus raised water levels by about six feet. The Trump Organization met with the village over the issue, though {{it did not take}} corrective actions. After negotiations ended, the village billed the club $238,353. The Trump Organization blamed the flooding on a village drainage pipe which lacked a <b>grate,</b> and blamed the conflict on then-Briarcliff mayor William Vescio, who owns a company that previously came into conflict with Trump. Vescio denied the relation to the previous conflict and claimed that the flooding was caused by rocks and trees at washed down the hill from the golf club.|$|E
5|$|After {{they started}} to break apart, further orders were placed for {{additional}} suits and all the suits used eventually fell apart during the four days they were used on set. In order to film one scene, McChesney wore the suit open-backed due to the damage. No optical effects were used in creating Armus. For the scene where Riker is pulled into the oil, a stuntman {{was used as a}} stand in for Jonathan Frakes. Where Riker's face emerges from the oil, it was actually a plaster cast of Frakes' face painted black. It was placed on the same <b>grate</b> used to lift McChesney, and filmed lifting out of the liquid. The twitching effect in Yar's death was due to a wire tied around Crosby's waist being pulled on.|$|E
50|$|To {{prevent future}} floods, PUB spent $25,000 to install five debris-trapping <b>grates</b> at Stamford Canal. These zig-zag <b>grates</b> {{are meant to}} catch debris without {{stopping}} the flow of water, thus preventing the canal from being choked again. The new <b>grates</b> are installed at Camp Road, Napier Road near Minden Road, Nassim Road, Grange Road and Tanglin Road.|$|R

5|$|Gases {{from the}} furnace are cleaned using {{selective}} non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and active carbon injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, dioxins and heavy metals from the plants emissions. The remaining gases are passed through fine-fabric bag filters to remove and solid particles, {{before it is}} released from the chimney. Each incineration line has its own independent stack in the chimney, and the flue gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room. The remaining fly ash from the filters contains particles from the incineration, lime from the spray absorbers, salt and carbon dust, and so is stored in a sealed silo until it is taken from the site for disposal. Incinerator bottom ash left on the incineration <b>grate</b> after the burning is moved by converyor to a bunker. Whilst on the conveyor, a magnet removes ferrous metal from the ash for recycling. The remaining ash is then used as an aggregate in the construction industry.|$|E
5|$|Kiedis had {{remained}} sober the entire tour and maintained positive disposition during shows. Navarro, however, was growing tired of touring, {{and that was}} beginning to <b>grate</b> on his fellow band-mates. Kiedis suffered an additional injury in Prague after falling off the stage while attempting to execute a back flip. He was forced to wear a back brace {{for the next few}} shows, which restricted his actions to the area around his microphone. After shows in Paris and London, the band returned home to Los Angeles. Kiedis began taking drugs once again, though he forced himself to discontinue after several weeks. The band was then asked to play in the North Pole for roughly 100 contest winners of a concert set up by Molson, a Canadian beer company. While the show was mildly motivating to the band, they returned home after two days.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{decide to}} split up and {{interrogate}} the doppelgangers. Betty tells Mulder that Lulu is causing {{all of the problems}} and forcing her to leave, while Lulu tells Scully the same thing. Later, the two look-alikes pass each other and a sewer <b>grate</b> blows open, sucking Mulder into the storm drain and sealing him in. Scully finds that the girls share the same father, a {{man by the name of}} Bob Damphouse, who is in prison. Damphouse is revealed to be mentally insane, and is always in a fit of rage. Eventually, Mulder finds his way out of the storm drain. At the prison, Scully meets a man that looks exactly like Bert Zupanic. Lulu and Betty meet at a stadium and everyone in the audience breaks into a fight. The other Bert Zupanic shows up and everyone stops fighting. The two Zupanics see each other and a fight breaks out again. The episode ends with Mulder and Scully shown bruised and beaten.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{failure modes}} of foam core {{sandwich}} composites are investigated by using embedded Fiber Bragg <b>Grating</b> sensors. Sandwich specimens with Fiber Bragg <b>Grating</b> sensors, embedded inside the face sheet, are manufactured using vacuum infusion process and then {{subjected to a}} static and a cyclic loading under the three-point bending mode. Different failure modes are monitored utilizing the wavelength shift and the spectrum of Fiber Bragg <b>Grating</b> sensors.

He fights to the end in the colony's operation room, where the survivors of the party make their final stand, and is pulled through a floor <b>grate</b> by an Alien while providing cover fire. In Aliens: Colonial Marines, Hudson's corpse was discovered in the sewers with a large hole in his chest, revealing that Hudson was impregnated by a Facehugger after he was dragged beneath the grates and later died when a chestburster erupted from his chest.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Street Bridge was a {{double-leaf}} deck-girder {{bascule bridge}} in Bridgeport, Connecticut, United States, that spanned the Pequonnock River and connected Grand Street and Artic Street. It {{was one of}} three movable bridges planned by the City of Bridgeport in 1916 {{at the request of the}} War Department during World War I. Construction was completed in 1919, but the delays surrounding the construction went to the Connecticut Supreme Court in case of Edward DeV. Tompkins, Inc. vs. City of Bridgeport, Connecticut. The court ruled in favor of Tompkins and awarded damages equal to the contract. In 1936, the bridge had excessive settling and required the replacement of its southeast pier. As part of the repairs, a new floor and electrical system were installed. In 1965, the floor was replaced with a steel <b>grate</b> on I-beam floor. In 1984, the eastern approach span was replaced and the northwest trunnion post was reconstructed. The bridge was closed in the 1990s and dismantled in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{about the}} gameplay, Famitsu was {{slightly}} mixed about some aspects; one critic praised the added tutorial for allowing new players to be eased {{in the series}} gameplay, while another compared the tutorial to a nagging mother and said it and the unseen Tactician representing the player might <b>grate</b> with series fans. Bramwell praised the integration of RPG elements and tactical gameplay, in addition to finding the permanent death of characters a suitable fit for the game's world. Dingo was positive about the level design and controls, but warned that it was quite short and lacking in depth when compared to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Massimilla found the gameplay both accessible and challenging {{as she made her}} way through the game, while Nutt was skeptical about the permanent death system and critical of the in-game economy despite generally enjoying the experience. Harris again compared it to Advance Wars, but said that Fire Emblem had enough unique elements to make it its own product, and generally praised the title's accomplishments. Burns, who had experience of earlier Fire Emblem titles, praised the game as a worthy entry in the series and a good entry for the West to experience.|$|E
