50|$|A {{total of}} four tunnels have been {{discovered}} so far, but there {{are believed to be}} up to twenty more. The South Korean military still devotes specialist resources to finding <b>infiltration</b> <b>tunnels,</b> though tunnels are much less significant now that North Korean long-range artillery and missiles have become more effective.|$|R
50|$|In South Korea, many of North Korean {{small arms}} are showcased in many war museums, such as War Memorial of Korea, tourist sites of North Korean <b>infiltration</b> <b>tunnels,</b> {{or for the}} purpose of inspiring patriotism to citizens. The Korean Defense Intelligence Command (KDIC) {{displays}} North Korean equipment (most of them used by Special Forces) on an exhibition van in various military-related events place such as military units or public establishments.|$|R
50|$|During Operation Protective Edge (July-August 2014) Combat Engineers {{played a}} major role in {{destroying}} Hamas' cross-border underground <b>infiltration</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The tunnels were exposed and cleared by armored bulldozers and excavators, and then detonated by Yahalom's Samoor unit. In total, about 32 tunnels were destroyed. In addition, combat engineers participated in the battles, neutralized Hamas-planted improvised explosive devices, cleared booby-traps, opened routes for armor and infantry, and destroyed terrorist infrastructure. Six combat engineers were killed during the battles in the Gaza Strip.|$|R
50|$|The tunnel, {{generally}} {{called the}} Third <b>Infiltration</b> <b>Tunnel</b> or 3rd Tunnel, {{is now a}} tourist site, though still well guarded.|$|E
50|$|The Third Tunnel of Aggression (Korean: 제3땅굴), or Third <b>Infiltration</b> <b>Tunnel,</b> {{is one of}} four known tunnels {{under the}} border between North Korea and South Korea, {{extending}} south of Panmunjom.|$|E
50|$|The 25th Infantry Division (제25보병사단), {{also known}} as Biryong (비룡), {{was one of three}} {{infantry}} divisions founded {{near the end of the}} Korean War. One of the regiment's reconnaissance companies from the 25th infantry division found the North Korean-made 1st <b>infiltration</b> <b>tunnel</b> on November 15, 1974.|$|E
50|$|The {{buffer zone}} that falls {{south of the}} Southern Limit Line is called the Civilian Control Zone. Barbed wire fences and manned {{military}} guard posts mark the Civilian Control Line. The Civilian Control Zone {{is necessary for the}} military to monitor civilian travel to tourist destinations close to the Southern Limit Line of the DMZ like the discovered <b>infiltration</b> <b>tunnels</b> and tourist observatories. Usually when traveling within the Civilian Control Zone South Korean soldiers accompany tourist buses and cars as armed guards to monitor the civilians as well as to protect them from North Korean intruders.|$|R
5000|$|On 8 July 2014 Israel {{launched}} Operation Protective Edge {{to counter}} increased Hamas rocket fire from Gaza. The conflict {{ended with a}} permanent cease-fire after 7 weeks, and more than 2,200 dead. 64 of the dead were Israeli soldiers, 7 were civilians in Israel (from rocket attacks), and 2,101 were killed in Gaza, of which according to UN OCHA at least 1,460 were civilians. Israel says 1,000 of the dead were militants. Following the conflict, Mahmoud Abbas president of the Palestinian Authority, accused Hamas of needlessly extending the fighting in the Gaza Strip, contributing to the high death toll, of running a [...] "shadow government" [...] in Gaza, and of illegally executing scores of Palestinians. Hamas has complained about the slow delivery of reconstruction materials after the conflict and announced that they were diverting these materials from civilian uses to build more <b>infiltration</b> <b>tunnels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Israeli {{government}} ministers Naftali Bennett and Danny Danon {{have repeatedly}} rejected {{the creation of}} a Palestinian state, with Bennett stating [...] "I will do everything in my power to make sure they never get a state." [...] Bennett stated that [...] "relinquishing control of the West Bank would expose Israel's home front to <b>infiltration</b> <b>tunnels</b> leading into the heartland of Israel," [...] citing the case of Gaza as a scenario that could repeat itself. In an August 2011 interview with Teymoor Nabili on Al Jazeera English, Danny Danon said [...] "There is place only for one state on the land of Israel.... I do not believe in a two-state solution.", reaffirming his stance in June 2013: “Oy vey! Is it such a criminal offense to oppose a two-state solution?” In June 2016 a poll showed that only 4 out of 20 Israeli ministers accepted the state of Palestine's right to exist [...] A poll carried out in 2011 by the Hebrew University indicated that 58% of Israelis and 50% of Palestinians support a two-state solution based on the Clinton Parameters.|$|R
50|$|Despite the ceasefire, Palestinians {{continued}} to launch missiles into Israel. Around 7 pm, a Grad rocket fired at Beersheba was intercepted by Iron Dome. A second rocket landed {{in an empty}} field. Neither projectile caused injuries or damage. Following the attack, local authorities announced that schools in Ashdod, Ashkelon, Beersheba, Kiryat Gat, Kiryat Malachi, Gan Yavne and the Bnei Shimon Regional Council would be closed for March 15. Some schools had been open on March 14 after the recent escalation was perceived as having ended. Israel responded to the attack with air strikes on an <b>infiltration</b> <b>tunnel</b> and a rocket launching site.|$|E
50|$|Dora Observatory {{is on the}} South Korean side of the 38th parallel. Situated on top of Dorasan (Mount Dora), the {{observatory}} looks across the Demilitarized Zone. It {{is the part of}} South Korea closest to the North. Visitors can catch a rare glimpse of the reclusive North Korean state through binoculars from the 304 square feet, 500-person capacity observatory. They {{will be able to see}} the North Korean propaganda village situated in the DMZ, a remnant of the old prosperity of the North, and can see as far as the city of Kaesong. The observatory is very close to the Third Tunnel (Third North Korean <b>Infiltration</b> <b>Tunnel),</b> a massive North Korean-dug tunnel which was planned as a pathway for invasion to the South if war had re-erupted and it had not been discovered. The Dorasan Station, also nearby, is designed to be the station that connects the railroads of the South and North one day in the future.|$|E
5000|$|The Boston Globe has {{characterized}} Jacobs as “the primary {{critic of the}} Roxbury mosque.” Jacobs has claimed, on behalf of APT, that “we think the Society of Boston leadership are hiding behind the general Muslim population” and asserted that those funding the project were associated with extremists. United States Attorney Carmen Ortiz characterized APT’s view in this connection as “incredibly racist and unfair.” Jacobs has noted that his group held a rally at the mosque’s opening attended by Frank Gaffney, director of the Center for Security Policy. (According to public IRS filings, APT received over $121,457 from Gaffney’s organization in 2009.) As late as 2014, Jacobs and another APT official claimed that the Islamic Society of Boston “constitutes a vast <b>infiltration</b> <b>tunnel</b> beneath our feet” (in an apparent reference to tunnels dug between Israel and the Gaza Strip). In 2010, Jacobs was condemned in an open letter by over 70 Boston-area rabbis for his critique of one rabbi in a June 4, 2010 column, where he claimed that the rabbi had “refused to acknowledge” a number of allegations Jacobs had made {{in relation to the}} Islamic Society of Boston and other local Muslim organizations. In addition, the rabbis requested that Jacobs “discontinue his destructive campaign against Boston’s Muslim community, which,” they argued, “is based on innuendo, half-truths and unproven conspiracy theories.” ...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the high}} {{incidence}} of CTS, there are no precise diagnostic criteria. The history is useful, but the value of so-called provocative tests is questionable. Electrophysiology is required in the atypical cases; however, it has no prognostic value. There is no good correlation between electrophysiology and symptoms. The outcome seems to be favorable in patients without workmen's compensation, with a mild to moderate impairment preoperatively, and with a favorable response to carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>infiltration.</b> Postoperatively the electrophysiologic parameters ameliorate symptoms, but this is not correlated to the patient's satisfaction. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Termites can {{be major}} {{agricultural}} pests, particularly in East Africa and North Asia, where crop losses can be severe (3–100% in crop loss in Africa). Counterbalancing {{this is the}} greatly improved water <b>infiltration</b> where termite <b>tunnels</b> in the soil allow rainwater to soak in deeply, which helps reduce runoff and consequent soil erosion through bioturbation. In South America, cultivated plants such as eucalyptus, upland rice and sugarcane can be severely damaged by termite infestations, with attacks on leaves, roots and woody tissue. Termites can also attack other plants, including cassava, coffee, cotton, fruit trees, maize, peanuts, soybeans and vegetables. Mounds can disrupt farming activities, {{making it difficult for}} farmers to operate farming machinery; however, despite farmers' dislike of the mounds, it is often the case that no net loss of production occurs. Termites can be beneficial to agriculture, such as by boosting crop yields and enriching the soil. Termites and ants can re-colonise untilled land that contains crop stubble, which colonies use for nourishment when they establish their nests. The presence of nests in fields enables larger amounts of rainwater to soak into the ground and increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil, both essential for the growth of crops.|$|R
40|$|Widgets {{are small}} {{standalone}} Web applications usually {{designed for a}} single specific function and quick instant access to Web 2. 0 services, Internet content, native resources or device functionality, packaged {{in a way to}} allow a single download and installation on a user's computer or mobile device. The Widget concept has been embraced by large players both in the mobile phone and operating system industry; Nokia, Microsoft and Apple have all announced the support for widgets in their products. Furthermore, Gartner states that widgets will be an important mobile application delivery technology by 2009. Widgets are implemented using standard client-side Web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and XML. The technologies are exactly those who are incorporated in the AJAX development approach. Typical examples of widgets are clocks, weather forecasters, news readers and photo albums. They can be both fun and useful, and float on the desktop for quick and easy access to information or services. The different application areas can be summarized as: accessory widgets (e. g., clocks, calendars etc.), application widgets (e. g., games, SMS, address book etc.), or information widgets (e. g., weather, stocks, news etc.). Widgets may run as standalone applications, meaning outside of a Web browser, or may be embedded into a Web document. The first type of widget mentioned is categorized as a desktop widget or mobile widget depending on the device, and the second type is categorized as a Web widget. Desktop and mobile widgets are executed within a special runtime environment, commonly referred to as widget engine. Since widgets are based on Web technology the widget engines need the same core functionality as a Web browser. Most widget engines utilize a Web browser core, consisting of all functionality needed to render content and execute scripts, as part of their architecture to be able to instantiate and run widgets. This Web runtime renders HTML and CSS instructions, interprets JavaScript code and handles user interaction. The key benefit of widgets is Web technology. The number of developers that master Web development is much larger than the ones mastering native programming languages or Java. In addition, since widgets build on Web technology it is easy to utilize existing Web services provided by Web 2. 0 giants like Facebook, YouTube, Google, etc. Furthermore, single purpose applications like widgets encourage the creation of long tail applications and are generally not that complex to develop because of their size. Their user interface can be kept simple, which allows easy and intuitive interaction though the limited input capabilities of mobile devices. Widgets also have the advantage of less data traffic compared to browsing, which result in lower costs for mobile users. The security aspects of widgets are the most alarming, as discussed in the author s paper (An Analysis of Widget Security) currently submitted to the NordSec 2009 conference. The current security model is not satisfactory and does not protect the user properly from malicious content or attacks. At its worst attackers may use widgets as an <b>infiltration</b> <b>tunnel</b> to seize control over the user s device. There is a strong need for a security framework that secures the user s device. The OMTP BONDI initiative is currently working on such a framework, but there are still lots of aspects that need elaboration. Research of market-leading widget engines has shown that there are many interoperability problems between the widget platforms. This makes it more difficult to port widgets from one platform to another. Experimentation on porting widgets has revealed that the effort for porting depends on the widget type: widgets which do not access native functions can be ported easily, whereas the effort for porting other widgets is much higher or porting is not possible at all. In addition, widgets that make use of proprietary ways of describing the user interface are the most demanding to port, since creating the user interface is {{a major part of the}} widget development process. W 3 C is currently working on recommended standards for all the different aspects of widgets: packaging format, configuration document language, API, security model/policies, and language to declare the user interface in. To avoid fragmentation, standardisation of widgets has to be progressed. Most of the widget vendors have chosen to follow these guidelines and are currently modifying their platforms to conform to it. </p...|$|E
