500|$|With little silver coined in {{the second}} half of the 18th century, the burden of small change fell on the copper coinage, of which the highest {{denomination}} before 1797 was the halfpenny. Many official halfpennies were melted down clandestinely and lightweight counterfeits made with the copper. The Mint found in 1787 that at most 8 percent of [...] "halfpennies" [...] in circulation were real. A withdrawal of the existing copper coinage was deemed impractical due to transport difficulties. The Government would not accept copper coinage for taxes, and the small merchants who accumulated large stocks of real and dubious copper coin sought relief. Areas not near London were sometimes short of coppers, since new issues could only be purchased at the Mint's office at the Tower, <b>in</b> <b>packets</b> of 5 or 10 shillings. The small change shortage made it difficult, by the late 1780s, for employers to pay workers.|$|E
500|$|The general {{function}} of the Assay Commission {{was to examine the}} gold and silver coins of the Mint and ensure they met the proper specifications. [...] Assay commissioners were placed on one of three committees in most years: [...] the Counting, Weighing, and Assaying Committees. The Counting Committee verified that the number of each type of coin <b>in</b> <b>packets</b> selected from the pyx matched what Mint records said should be there. The Weighing Committee measured the weight of coins from the pyx, checking them against the weight required by law. The Assaying Committee worked with the Philadelphia Mint's assayer as he measured the precious metal content of some of the coins. [...] In some years there was a Committee on Resolutions—in 1912, it urged that a leaflet be published for visitors to [...] the Mint's coin collection, and that a medal be struck to commemorate the collection. The full Assay Commission adopted that committee's report.|$|E

[...] It is then possible for multiple players to go over the winning score, yet if none has taken a bid and met the resulting contract, a win has not happened and play continues. [...] It is also possible for a person to lose with the high score if they do not take a winning bid.|$|E

However, existing literature lacks studies on improving green performance of geocast routings for the Internet of Vehicles.

We introduce energy efficiency <b>in</b> <b>packet</b> forwarding as a more appropriate indicator than energy consumption.

40|$|As {{applications}} {{scale to}} increasingly large processor counts, the interconnection network is frequently the limiting factor in application performance.
