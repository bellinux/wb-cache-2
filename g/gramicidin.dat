5|$|D-isomers are {{uncommon}} in live organisms. For instance, <b>gramicidin</b> is a polypeptide made up from mixture of D- and L-amino acids. Other compounds containing D-amino acid are tyrocidine and valinomycin. These compounds disrupt bacterial cell walls, particularly in Gram-positive bacteria. Only 837 D-amino acids {{were found in}} Swiss-Prot database (187 million amino acids analysed).|$|E
25|$|<b>Gramicidin</b> S {{differs from}} other <b>gramicidin</b> types {{in that it}} is a {{cationic}} cyclic decapeptide and has a structure of an anti-parallel beta-sheet. <b>Gramicidin</b> S molecule is amphiphilic, with hydrophobic amino acids (D-Phe, Val, Leu side chains) and charged aminoacid (L-Orn). It exhibits strong antibiotic activity towards Gram-negative and Gram-positive and even several pathogenic fungi. The mode of action is not entirely agreed upon, but it is generally accepted that it is disruption of the lipid membrane and enhancement of the permeability of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Unfortunately, being hemolytic at even low concentrations, <b>gramicidin</b> S is only used as topical applications at present. Additionally, <b>Gramicidin</b> S has been employed as a spermicide and therapeutic for genital ulcers caused by sexually transmitted disease.|$|E
25|$|X and Y {{depend upon}} the <b>gramicidin</b> molecule. There exist valine and {{isoleucine}} variants of all three <b>gramicidin</b> species, and 'X' can be either. Y determines which is which; as Y <b>gramicidin</b> A contains tryptophan, B phenylalanine, and C tyrosine. Also note the alternating stereochemical configurations (in the form of D and L) of the amino acids; this {{is vital to the}} formation of the β-helix.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{derivative}} of <b>gramicidin,</b> {{produced by the}} gram-positive bacterium Bacillus brevis. <b>Gramicidin</b> S is a cyclodecapeptide, constructed as two identical pentapeptides joined head to tail, formally written as cyclo(-Val-Orn-Leu-D-Phe-Pro-)2. That is to say, it forms a ring structure composed of five different amino acids, each one used twice within the structure. Another interesting point is that it utilizes two amino acids uncommon in peptides: ornithine {{as well as the}} atypical stereoisomer of phenylalanine. It is synthesized by <b>gramicidin</b> S synthetase.|$|E

25|$|In 1939, the French {{microbiologist}} René Dubos {{isolated the}} substance tyrothricin and later showed it {{was composed of}} two substances, <b>gramicidin</b> (20%) and tyrocidine (80%). These were the first antibiotics to be manufactured commercially.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the <b>gramicidin</b> head-to-head dimer in micelles and lipid bilayers was determined by solution and solid-state NMR. The structure was first proposed by D. W. Urry in 1971. In organic solvents and crystals, this peptide forms different types of non-native double helices.|$|E
25|$|A set of multienzymes (peptide synthase CepA, CepB, and CepC) are {{responsible}} for assembling the heptapeptide. (Figure 2). The organization of CepA, CepB, and Cep C closely resembles other peptide synthases such as those for surfactin (SrfA1, SrfA2, and SrfA3) and <b>gramicidin</b> (GrsA and GrsB). Each peptide synthase activates codes for various amino acids to activate each domain. CepA codes for modules 1, 2, and 3. CepB codes for modules 4, 5, and 6, and CepC codes for module 7. The three peptide synthases are located {{at the start of}} the region of the bacterial genome linked with antibiotic biosynthesis, and span 27 kb.|$|E
25|$|This {{variation}} of the patch clamp method {{is very similar to}} the whole-cell configuration. The main difference {{lies in the fact that}} when the experimenter forms the gigaohm seal, suction is not used to rupture the patch membrane. Instead, the electrode solution contains small amounts of an antifungal or antibiotic agent, such as amphothericin-B, nystatin, or <b>gramicidin,</b> which diffuses into the membrane patch and forms small pores in the membrane, providing electrical access to the cell interior. When comparing the whole-cell and perforated patch methods, one can think of the whole-cell patch as an open door, in which there is complete exchange between molecules in the pipette solution and the cytoplasm. The perforated patch can be likened to a screen door that only allows the exchange of certain molecules from the pipette solution to the cytoplasm of the cell.|$|E

Her dissertation was on the structure of the antibiotic <b>gramicidin.</b> Thatcher did not devote herself entirely to studying chemistry as she only intended to be a chemist {{for a short period of}} time. Even when working on chemistry, she was already thinking towards law and politics.

2500|$|<b>Gramicidin</b> S biosynthetic pathway {{consists}} of two-enzyme of nonribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs), <b>gramicidin</b> S synthetase I (GrsA) and <b>gramicidin</b> S synthetase II (GrsB), {{to give a}} product as a cyclic decapeptide. Within the biosynthetic pathway, there are total of five modules that specifically recognize, activate, and condense the amino acids to <b>gramicidin</b> S. Starting module GrsA {{consists of}} three domains: [...] Adenylation (A) domain where it incorporates the amino acid and activates it by adenylation using ATP, Thiolation (T) domain or peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) in which the adenylated amino acid gets covalently attached to the 4´-phosphopantetheine group and this gets loaded onto the conserved serine in the T domain, Epimerization (E) domain where it epimerizes L-amino acid to D-amino acid. Starting module GrsA loads D-Phe onto the system.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Gramicidin</b> S was {{discovered}} by Russian microbiologist Georgyi Frantsevitch Gause and his wife Maria Brazhnikova in 1942. Within the year <b>Gramicidin</b> S was being used in Soviet military hospitals to treat infection and eventually found usage at {{the front lines of}} combat by 1946. Gause was awarded the Stalin Prize for Medicine for his discovery in 1946. In 1944, <b>Gramicidin</b> S was sent by the Ministry of Health of the USSR to Great Britain via the International Red Cross in a collaborative effort to establish the exact structure. English chemist Richard Synge proved that the compound was an original antibiotic and a polypeptide using paper chromatography. He would later go on to receive the Nobel Prize for his work in chromatography. The crystal structure was finally established by Dorothy Hodgkin and Gerhard Schmidt; Margaret Thatcher worked for a term in 1947 with Gerhard Schmidt on the antibiotic <b>Gramicidin</b> S, as an undergraduate research project. [...] The importance of <b>Gramicidin</b> S and antibiotic research in general was so great that Gause was not persecuted during the period of Lysenkoism in the USSR, while many of his colleagues were being executed. Indeed, it was his need for developing new strains to mass-produce antibiotics that allowed politically sanctioned collaborations with geneticists like Joseph Rapoport and Alexander Malinovsky, who would both actively participate in the downfall of Lysenkoism.|$|E

2500|$|That <b>gramicidin</b> D {{functions}} as a channel was demonstrated by Hladky and Haydon, who investigated the unitary conductance of the channel. In general, <b>gramicidin</b> channels are completely selective for monovalent cations and the single-channel conductances for the alkali cations are ranked {{in the same order}} as the aqueous mobilities of these ions. Divalent cations like [...] block the channel by binding near its mouth so [...] it is essentially impermeable to divalent cations and also excludes anions. [...] in particular is excluded from the channel because its hydration shell is thermodynamically stronger than that of most monovalent cations. The channel is permeable to most monovalent cations, which move through the channel in single file. The channel is filled with about six water molecules, almost all of which must be displaced when an ion is transported. Thus, ions moving through the <b>gramicidin</b> pore carry along a single file of water molecules. Such a flux of ion and water molecules is known as flux coupling. In the presence of a second type of permeable ion, the two ions couple their flux, as well. Like valinomycin and nonactin, the <b>gramicidin</b> channel is selective for potassium over sodium, but only slightly so. It has a permeability ratio of 2.9. Though it is impermeable to anions, conditions exist under which some anion permeation may be observed. Its ability to bind and transport cations is due to the presence of cation-binding sites, one strong and the other weak, in the channel.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Gramicidin</b> {{is active}} against Gram-positive bacteria, {{except for the}} Gram-positive bacilli, and against select Gram-negative organisms, such as Neisseria bacteria. [...] Its {{therapeutic}} use is limited to topical application, as it induces hemolysis in lower concentrations than bacteria cell death, so it cannot be administered internally. Since the exterior epidermis is composed of dead cells, applying it {{to the surface of}} the skin will not cause harm.|$|E
2500|$|VMD was {{equipped}} with the option of loading BioMOCA structures. This is a very useful feature as one could load both the protein [...] structure (i.e. PDB or PQR file) along with the structures generated by BioMOCA to make comparisons. Figure at the right shows how BioMOCA has generated a structure for <b>Gramicidin</b> channel with a membrane wrapped around it. Furthermore, BioMOCA also dumps the ion trajectories in standard formats {{so they could be}} later loaded to molecular visualization tools such as VMD and watched frame by frame in a movie format.|$|E
2500|$|... {{divalent}} ions such as Ca2+ and signaling molecules such as cAMP. Consequently, one {{can have}} {{recordings of the}} entire cell, as in whole-cell patch clamping, while retaining most intracellular signaling mechanisms, as in cell-attached recordings. As a result, there is reduced current rundown, and stable perforated patch recordings can last longer than one hour. Disadvantages include a higher access resistance, relative to whole-cell, due to the partial membrane occupying {{the tip of the}} electrode. This may decrease current resolution and increase recording noise. It can also take a significant amount of time for the antibiotic to perforate the membrane (about 15 minutes for amphothericin-B, and even longer for <b>gramicidin</b> and nystatin). The membrane under the electrode tip is weakened by the perforations formed by the antibiotic and can rupture. If the patch ruptures, the recording is then in whole-cell mode, with antibiotic contaminating the inside of the cell.|$|E
2500|$|In 1932, Bayer sought medical {{applications}} of its dyes. Gerhard Domagk {{identified as an}} antibacterial a red azo dye, introduced in 1935 as the first antibacterial drug, prontosil, soon found at Pasteur Institute to be a prodrug degraded in vivo into sulfanilamide – a colorless intermediate for many, highly colorfast azo dyes – already with an expired patent, synthesized in 1908 in Vienna by the researcher Paul Gelmo for his doctoral research. [...] By the 1940s, over 500 related sulfa drugs were produced. Medications in high demand during World War II (1939–45), these first miracle drugs, chemotherapy of wide effectiveness, propelled the American pharmaceutics industry. [...] In 1939, at Oxford University, seeking an alternative to sulfa drugs, Howard Florey developed Fleming's penicillin into the first systemic antibiotic drug, penicillin G. (<b>Gramicidin,</b> developed by René Dubos at Rockefeller Institute in 1939, was the first antibiotic, yet its toxicity restricted it to topical use.) [...] After World War II, Cornelius P.
