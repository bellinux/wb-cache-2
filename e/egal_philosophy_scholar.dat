50|$|In {{addition}} to being used to describe, predict, and explain behavior, game theory has also been used to develop theories of ethical or normative behavior and to prescribe such behavior.

Game-theoretic arguments of this type can be found as far back as Plato.|$|R

[...] Rather than creating a philosophical model that reflects the Chinese spirit, what has been created is an exaltation of the Western model by imitation.|$|R

The exhibit {{has been on}} show in Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim, Maastricht, Genova and in Stockholm (in the last as [...] "Rainbow Animals"). It has, however, been criticized by <b>philosophy</b> <b>scholars,</b> as missing {{the point of the}} traditional terminology attributed to homosexual activity as [...] "against nature." [...] Such activity was most properly said to be against nature because it was using the reproductive power for essentially un-reproductive acts.|$|R

25|$|Hegel's {{influence}} was immense both within philosophy {{and in the}} other sciences. Throughout the 19th century many chairs of philosophy around Europe were held by Hegelians, and Søren Kierkegaard, Ludwig Feuerbach, Marx, and Friedrich Engels—among many others—were all deeply influenced by, but also strongly opposed to, many of the central themes of Hegel's <b>philosophy.</b> <b>Scholars</b> continue to find and point out Hegelian influences and approaches {{in a wide range of}} theoretical and/or learned works, such as Carl von Clausewitz's magnum opus on strategic thought, On War (1831).

50|$|Some authors, such as N.N Vasu, have {{depicted}} Odia Vaishnavism as 'Buddhist-Vaishnavism', {{since it}} does not accept Ramanuja's Viśiṣṭādvaita philosophy (11th century), nor does it adhere to orthodox Gaudiya Vaishnavism created in the 16th century. Other scholars, such as Prabhat Mukerjee, have denied these claims supporting the different varieties of Vaishnava <b>philosophy.</b> <b>Scholars</b> debate {{the influence of the}} Panchasakha from the original Vaishnava Agama (Pancharatras) while others source their ideas in Sahajayana Buddhism, and the Natha sampradaya. Both the Sahajayana Buddhists and the Panchasakha worshipped the image of Jagannatha as the Buddha, though the Panchasakhas saw Jagannatha as an incarnation of Vishnu as seen in the Dasāvatara image on the main mantel of the Jagannatha Temple.|$|R

Then came the flood of Greek literature which the new art of printing carried swiftly to every school in Europe, revealing a new world of poetry and <b>philosophy.</b> <b>Scholars</b> flocked to the universities, as adventurers {{to the new world}} of America, and there the old authority received a deathblow.

50|$|<b>Philosophy</b> <b>scholar</b> Arthur Burks, who {{had worked}} with von Neumann (and indeed, {{organized}} his papers after Neumann's death), headed the Logic of Computers Group at the University of Michigan. He brought the overlooked views of 19th century American thinker Charles Sanders Peirce into the modern age. Peirce was a strong believer that all of nature's workings were based on logic (though not always deductive logic). The Michigan group {{was one of the few}} groups still interested in alife and CAs in the early 1970s; one of its students, Tommaso Toffoli argued in his PhD thesis that the field was important because its results explain the simple rules that underlay complex effects in nature. Toffoli later provided a key proof that CAs were reversible, just as the true universe is considered to be.|$|R
5000|$|In literature, {{the use of}} {{masculine}} language to refer to men, women, intersex people, and nonbinary people may indicate a male or androcentic bias in society where men are seen as the 'norm' and women, intersex people, as well as nonbinary people are seen as the 'other'. Some examples are forms of address (such as [...] "Hey guys" [...] or [...] "Dear Sirs") and masculine nouns and pronouns (such as 'mankind', 'man' or 'he') to refer to men, women, intersex people, and nonbinary people. <b>Philosophy</b> <b>scholar</b> Jennifer Saul argued {{that the use of}} male generic language marginalizes women in society. In recent years, some writers have started to use more gender-inclusive language (for instance, using the pronouns they/them, and using gender-inclusive words like humankind, person, partner, spouse, businessperson, fire-fighter, chairperson and police-officer).|$|R

5000|$|In 1934, on the {{recommendation}} of treaty port journalist H.G.E. Woodhead, Lattimore was appointed editor of Pacific Affairs, published by the Institute of Pacific Relations, which he edited from Beijing.

As he later recalled, he was [...] "continually in hot water, especially with the Japan Council, which thought I was too anti-imperialist, and the Soviet Council, which thought that its own anti-imperialist line was the only permissible one...." [...] As explained below, others later accused him of motives which were less scholarly than political. Lattimore sought articles {{from a wide range of}} perspectives and made the journal a forum for new ideas, especially from the social sciences and social <b>philosophy.</b> <b>Scholars</b> and writers of all persuasions were contributors, including Pearl S.

40|$|How could a web {{navigation}} enlighten or {{affect a}} <b>philosophy</b> <b>scholar?</b> Especially within an educational scenario, is the constantly {{increasing number of}} philosophical web materials a source of confusion, or an advan-tage? In our work we have been investigating the requirements and features of the possible navigation mechanisms a philosophy student could benefit from. In particular, {{in the context of}} the Semantic Web (Berners-Lee, Hend-ler, & Lassila, 2001), we have identified some of the “learning pathways” which can be used for dynamically presenting these materials within a meaningful context. For example, imagine that from the paragraph 7 of Wittgenstein’s Trac-tatus, by selecting an interpretative navigation path, you could easily jump to Max Black’s detailed commentary on it. And from there, being interested in Black’s interpretation and wanting to gather information on its possible origins, you were able to query the web using a comparative navigation path, aimed at highlighting what Wittgenstein and Black had in common...|$|R
