5|$|The division's {{commanding}} officer, General Lafontaine, {{put more}} faith into fortifications than training, as <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> would {{compensate for the}} weakness of the division.

5|$|Thirdly, Hays faced {{opposition}} to {{his choice of}} Prince Rupert, on Kaien Island, B.C., for the western terminal, because {{there was not much}} traffic there. Hays preferred the location as <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> would provide a shorter route for transshipment to destinations in Asia.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{supports}} expanding solar, wind, {{and nuclear}} power, and offshore drilling exploration {{as a means}} to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil. But, when faced with the controversial issue of whether an offshore wind farm should be allowed in the waters off the Cape Cod coast in Massachusetts, a major tourist destination and boating location, he expressed opposition, saying <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> would hinder tourism and boating in the area.|$|E

5|$|In 1970, the {{proposed}} visit of a South African team to England was subject of widespread public opposition. The MCC {{was no longer}} solely responsible for any decisions, being {{only a part of}} the Cricket Council, but Allen pressed the government to intervene and decide whether the tour should go ahead. <b>He</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> was a political matter outside the scope of cricket authorities; the government eventually became involved and the tour was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Oscar Arias, President of Costa Rica, {{contacted}} Louisville mayor Jerry Abramson {{to inquire}} about buying the bridge to dismantle it and reassemble in Costa Rica, as <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> would be cheaper to import the bridge than build a new one. At the time the city did not actually own the bridge, and the plan never went through.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} his {{relatively}} small stature, , he excelled in the air, due to his heading accuracy and elevation.

5|$|In week nine, the Bulldogs {{played the}} Buffalo All-Americans, who were undefeated at the time. Thorpe started the game but came out at halftime because <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> would {{end in a}} tie. Both teams were slowed by a muddy field, and the {{football}} became soggy after three quarters. The lone score of the game came with under four minutes to play: a field goal from the Bulldogs' Feeney. The game was the only loss of the season for the All-Americans.|$|E
5|$|Smith's early musical {{influences}} {{were his}} mother, and his father, who played guitar. At {{the age of}} four years, Buster was playing the organ with his brother, pianist Boston Smith; Buster played the keys and Boston stepped on the pedals. Soon thereafter, his grandfather gave away the family organ because <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> would only direct Buster {{to a life of}} sin.|$|E
5|$|Balch's {{investigations}} into geomorphology and hydrology {{led to his}} decision {{to try to find}} the origins of the water that rose to the surface at Wookey Hole Caves, the source of the River Axe. In 1901, he led a team of miners and cavers to dig into Swildon's Hole, where he found the 'Forty Foot Pot' as well as chambers full of stalagmites. Despite the publicity around the find, Balch refused to disclose the location of the cave as <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> was too dangerous for amateur explorers. The farmer who owned the land denied them entrance the following year, turning the valley into a fish farm, so the team headed upstream where they discovered Eastwater Cavern, one of Balch's personal favourites.|$|E

5|$|Because of his father's background, Thakkar's {{early years}} in India were spent around actors. During these initial years, Thakkar worked with his father for some time in Mumbai, {{contributing}} to a 1971 Films Division of India documentary, and playing parts in television and radio shows. Thakkar also worked as a voice-over artist for television advertisements. At the same time, Thakkar's interest in mathematics and science remained predominant. Later on, {{he moved to the}} United States as <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> was easier to make visual effects movies in Hollywood. Currently, Thakkar stays with his wife and family in Virginia.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Vincent Demoulin {{described}} the species Lycoperdon americanum {{on the basis}} of a specimen found in North Carolina. Although <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> to be a unique species, several authors consider it synonymous with L.echinatum. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence and secondary structure of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes coding for the internal transcribed spacer units suggests that Lycoperdon echinatum forms a clade with the puffball genus Handkea, separate from the type species of Lycoperdon, Lycoperdon perlatum. In previous analyses that used only the rRNA sequences for phylogenetic comparison, L.echinatum formed a clade with L.mammiforme, L.foetidum, and Bovistella radicata (now known as Lycoperdon radicatum), but separate from L.pyriforme.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Morrissey and Mark Billingham {{launched}} the production company Sleepyhead, which produced the Thorne television series. The company {{was a part}} of Stagereel, a production house previously set up by Morrissey's brother Paul. The company bought the rights to adapt the Thorne novels and Morrissey was already developing it to pitch to television channels when Sky made an offer to broadcast it. As of 2010, Morrissey and Tubedale Films were developing two feature films with financing from the UK Film Council. Morrissey was critical of the Coalition government's decision to close the UK Film Council, as <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> was an asset to first-time filmmakers. The organisation's funding role was taken over by the British Film Institute in 2011.|$|E

5|$|In week nine, the All-Americans {{played the}} Bulldogs. Jim Thorpe, who was later {{inducted}} into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, started the game for the Bulldogs, but he came out at halftime because <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> would end in a tie. Both teams were slowed by a muddy field, and the football became soggy after three quarters. Neither the All-Americans nor the Bulldogs could gain a lot of yards during the game. The lone score of the game came with under four minutes to play: a field goal from the Bulldogs' Al Feeney. He never missed a field goal the entire 1920 season, and the final score of the game was 3–0.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} next {{considered}} in the Senate, where it faced stronger opposition from key Democrats led by Arthur Pue Gorman of Maryland, who insisted on more protection for their states' industries than the Wilson bill allowed. The bill passed the Senate with more than 600 amendments attached that nullified most of the reforms. The Sugar Trust in particular lobbied for changes that favored it {{at the expense of}} the consumer. Cleveland was outraged with the final bill, and denounced it as a disgraceful product of the control of the Senate by trusts and business interests. Even so, <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> was an improvement over the McKinley tariff and allowed it to become law without his signature.|$|E
5|$|The next {{significant}} {{manager of}} Bristol Rovers was Albert Prince-Cox, who introduced blue-and-white quarters as the team's kit because <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> made the players look {{larger and more}} intimidating. He also became the first manager {{to win a major}} cup competition with the club when they won the Division 3 (South) Cup in 1935. More success followed in the 1952–53 season when Bristol Rovers' longest serving post-war manager, Bert Tann, won a league title {{for the first time since}} 1905 and won promotion for the first time ever when the club won Division 3 (South). Tann remained in charge for eighteen years from 1950 to 1968.|$|E

5|$|Biographer Stephen Henderson {{maintains}} that Macdonald {{played a key}} role in the wartime conscription crises that beset the federal government in 1942, and again in 1944, as Prime Minister Mackenzie King tried to avoid imposing compulsory military service overseas. Macdonald himself strongly favoured conscription rather than relying solely on voluntary enlistment. A committed internationalist, <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> unfair that some bore the sacrifices of overseas service while others escaped what he saw as their military obligations. Macdonald realized however, that conscription was highly unpopular in French-speaking Quebec and that enforcing it would split the country at a time when national unity was crucial. He also recognized that in the early years of the war, voluntary enlistment was producing enough recruits to meet the needs of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Despite McDonald's close involvement, the xx {{had been}} {{encouraged}} to self-produce their album by Russell; <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> would remain faithful to both the band's distinctive live sound and the DIY ethic practiced at XL since its beginnings as a rave label. Smith was chosen {{by the rest of}} the group to produce xx. He used Logic 8 recording software on his Mac Pro and often worked late nights in a nearby conference room while they recorded in the studio with drafts of his beats. Smith produced rhythm tracks with an Akai MPC sampler, which he occasionally processed through a Roland RE-201 and other effects units. He also created click tracks for the rest of the band to keep timing when they recorded their individual parts. After those parts had been recorded, he refined and incorporated his beats into the songs for three to four weeks. Croft trusted that Smith, who did not want to conceal any imperfections by overproducing xx, would make it practical for them to perform live rather than layer the songs with several guitar or vocal elements.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's {{approach}} to government was less subtle {{than his father}} and brother. Once Emperor, he quickly dispensed with the Republican facade and transformed his government more or less formally into the divine monarchy <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> to be. By moving the centre of power to the imperial court, Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. He became personally involved in all branches of the administration: edicts were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced. Nevertheless, Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had virtually excluded non-Flavians from public office, Domitian rarely favoured his own family members {{in the distribution of}} strategic posts, admitting a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, and assigning men of the equestrian order to run the imperial bureaucracy.|$|E
