50|$|Depending on the {{required}} coal fineness, {{there are two}} types of classifier that may be selected for a vertical roller mill. The dynamic classifier, which consists of a stationary angled <b>inlet</b> <b>vane</b> assembly surrounding a rotating vane assembly or cage, is capable of producing micrometer-fine pulverized coal with a narrow particle size distribution. In addition, adjusting the speed of the rotating cage can easily change the intensity of the centrifugal force field in the classification zone to achieve coal fineness control real-time to make immediate accommodation for a change in fuel or boiler load conditions. For the applications where a micrometer-fine pulverized coal is not necessary, the static classifier, which consists of a cone equipped with adjustable vanes, is an option at a lower cost since it contains no moving parts. With adequate mill grinding capacity, a vertical mill equipped with a static classifier is capable of producing a coal fineness up to 99.5% or higher <50 mesh and 80% or higher <200 mesh, while one equipped with a dynamic classifier produces coal fineness levels of 100% <100 mesh and 95% <200 mesh, or better.|$|E

The measurements performed at elevated pressures were performed at 20, 50 and 85 bars for a N 2 /Exxsol system {{as well as a}} synthetic natural gas mix. The mesh pads studied varied in height, specific surface area, wire packing density, wire diameter as well as porosity. Liquid holdup measurements were made at five vertical positions and in addition pressure drop and separation efficiency were measured. The results show variations in holdup profile depending on liquid load, pad geometry, running time, measuring position and interfacial properties. Droplet size measurements were also made for all wire mesh pads below and at flooding of the wire mesh pads. A new equation was developed that qualitatively describes aspects of wire mesh pad design and was used for developing correlations. A novel method for measuring flooding point was developed and flooding points for several inlet pipe liquid volume fractions were made. A correlation predicting flooding points in wire mesh pads at both low and high pressure was developed. Dry pressure drop for all wire mesh pads was also determined. A correlation predicting dry pressure drop for spiral wound pads was developed. A novel method for measuring scrubber efficiency above a <b>inlet</b> <b>vane</b> at varying vertical positions was developed. The separation efficiency was measured at five different vertical positions in a scrubber column with an inner diameter of 252 mm. In addition a column of 150 mm was investigated at one position.

The condition monitoring of centrifugal pumps is highly regarded by many researchers and users to minimize unexpected break-downs.

This paper investigates {{a new approach to}} monitoring the conditions of impellers using surface vibration with advanced signal analysis. As overall vibration respons-es contain high level of broadband noises due to cavities and turbulences, noise reduction is critical to develop reliable and effective features. However, considering the modulation effect between rotating shaft and blade passing components, a modulation signal bispectrum (MSB) method is employed to extract these deterministic characteristics of modulations, which is different from previous researches in that broadband random sources are often used.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the electric power requirements necessary for ice protection of <b>inlet</b> guide <b>vanes</b> by continuous heating and by cyclical de-icing. Data are presented to show the effect of ambient-air temperature, liquid-water content, air velocity, heat-on period, and cycle times on the power requirements for these two methods of ice protection. The results showed that for a hypothetical engine using 28 <b>inlet</b> guide <b>vanes</b> under similar icing conditions, cyclical de-icing can provide a total power saving as high as 79 percent over that required for continuous heating.

The freestream turbulence intensity at the vane cascade inlet plane is 11 (2) percent, as measured by a single hot-wire placed perpendicular to the mean flow. The transient thermochromic liquid crystal technique is used to measure the convective heat transfer coefficient at the hub endwall for the baseline case (without air injection through the slots), and the heat transfer coefficient and cooling effectiveness at the same endwall for the cases with air injection at two blowing ratios.

The effects of <b>inlet</b> guide <b>vanes</b> on pump hydraulic performance and cavitation are investigated, where the total vapor fraction of impeller zone (Ftv) is calculated to predict the critical net positive suction head, which is compared with that predicted by efficiency criterion for different flow rates. The influences {{of the development of}} cavitation on internal flow in impeller zone are also investigated. The results obtained show that the cavitation performance of axial flow pump can be improved at off-design flow conditions by adjusting angles of <b>inlet</b> guide <b>vanes</b> to positive values at low flow rates and by regulating angles of <b>inlet</b> guide <b>vanes</b> to negative values at high flow rates. As the net positive suction head decreases, the vapor fraction first increases slowly and then increases greatly, clearly presenting cavitation process from inception to full development, which can be used to predict the required net positive suction head. When net positive suction head decreases to the value around required net positive suction head, the cavitation zone from tip of blade suction side close to leading edge and the cavitation zone from hub part of the blade suction side connect together. After the connection, the cavitation zones have great influence on the velocity flow, leading to the decrease in pump performance...|$|R

This technique, along {{with the effects of}} steady blade loading, were studied by means of experiments performed in a two-stage low-speed research turbine. With the second vane row fixed, the <b>inlet</b> <b>vane</b> row was indexed to six positions over one vane-pitch cycle for a range of stage loadings. The aerodynamic forcing function to the first-stage rotor was measured in the rotating reference frame, with the resulting rotor blade unsteady aerodynamic response quantified by rotor blades instrumented with dynamic pressure transducers. Reductions in the unsteady lift magnitude were achieved at all turbine operating conditions, with attenuation ranging from 37 % to 74 % of the maximum unsteady lift. Additionally, in complementary experiments, the effects of stator indexing and steady blade loading on the unsteady heat transfer of the first- and second-stage rotors was studied for the design and highest blade loading conditions using platinum-film heat gages. The attenuation of unsteady heat transfer coefficient was blade-loading dependent and location dependent along the chord and span, ranging 10 % to 90 % of maximum. Due to the high degree of location dependence of attenuation, stator indexing is therefore best suited to minimize unsteady heat transfer in local hot spots of the blade rather than the blade as a whole. ...|$|E

Even though the main objective of the power plant is to meet the increasing power demand at low cost, still it is behind the expectations due to low reliability of the power plant. Failures in the boiler side equipment have been considerably responsible for this with a huge financial loss to the country. This project studies the suitable designs for design faults and shortcomings of LVPS to improve {{the reliability of the}} power plant related to the boiler side. By analyzing the past data until the first overhaul of the power plant, it is revealed that the main failures are arisen in the primary air system, coal pulverizing system, secondary air and flue gas systems related to the boiler side. In addition to the low reliability of primary air system, it is not supplying the required total amount of primary air to the system to run the pulverizers within the safe margins. Installing a new primary air fan in the system not only meets the deficiency, but also improves the reliability. Failures related to the pitch controllers of forced draft fans and induced draft fans resulting to high vibrations and high bearing temperatures directly affect to the low reliability in the secondary air and flue gas system. Variable speed drivers to control the air flow instead of fan pitch controlling or <b>inlet</b> <b>vane</b> controlling methods are discussed in this paper. According to the past data of the plant, 53 % of failures arose in the pulverizing system have been recovered within ten hours.
