5|$|Even though peasant {{households}} {{were significantly}} smaller than aristocratic ones, the wealthiest of these would also employ servants. Service {{was a natural}} part of the cycle of life, and it was common <b>for</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> to spend some years away from home in the service of another household. This way they would learn the skills needed later in life, {{and at the same time}} earn a wage. This was particularly useful for girls, who could put the earnings towards their dowry.|$|E
5|$|Expanding {{access to}} parks was {{a feature of}} many {{initiatives}} Jewell undertook as Secretary.

Jewell led the kickoff of the Every Kid Every Park program by leading fourth graders on a hike through Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. The Every Kid initiative made every fourth grade student, and their families, eligible for a free one-year pass to every national park. Jewell also backed a 2016 initiative to expedite permitting for youth organizations to explore public wild lands on overnight or multi-day trips, particularly in less popular parks.|$|E
5|$|His {{social and}} {{political}} activities resulted in a diminished literary output. He wrote a new historical novel, Na polu chwały (On the Field of Glory), that was meant {{as the beginning of}} a new trilogy; it was, however, criticized as being a lesser version of his original Trilogy, and was never continued. Similarly, his contemporary novel Wiry Whirlpool (novel), 1910, which sought to criticize some of Sienkiewicz's political opponents, received a mostly polemical and politicized response. His 1910 novel <b>for</b> <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> W pustyni i w puszczy (In Desert and Wilderness), serialized in Kurier Warszawski (The Warsaw Courier), finishing in 1911, was much better received and became widely popular among children and young adults.|$|E
