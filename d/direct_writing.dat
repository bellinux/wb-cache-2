25|$|The book {{created a}} {{reaction}} in China, sparking follow-up essays by Chinese writers who were {{taken aback by}} the Phan's description of Vietnamese life under French colonial rule. It generated gloomy pieces by Chinese writers who predicted that their nation would suffer a similar fate if they failed to modernize. One such Chinese response later became a teaching text at the Tonkin Free School in Hanoi, a school run by Phan's contemporaries to promote the independence movement. However, Phan did not receive much of a reaction in terms of aid towards his independence efforts, since the book made Chinese readers worry about their own future. The book had a much better reception among Vietnamese readers. Phan and a colleague, Đặng Tử Kính, left Japan {{for the first time in}} August 1905, carrying 50 copies of the book that were to distributed throughout Vietnam, of which further copies were made inside the country. Phan's <b>direct</b> <b>writing</b> style, without the use of allegories, upset traditionalists but made the book more accessible to literate people who had not been trained in classical literature.|$|E

[...] The other Pythons have said that Chapman's biggest contribution in the writing room was an intuition for what was funny. Gilliam later recalled that [...] "Graham would do the nudge that would push it into something extraordinary." [...] The show was an immediate success, and Chapman was delighted to learn that medical students at St Bartholomew's crowded round the television in the bar to watch it. Chapman was frequently late for rehearsing or recording, leading to the other Pythons calling him [...] "the late Graham Chapman".|$|E

Besides that, it also looked into how teacher <b>direct</b> <b>written</b> corrective feedback affecting students’ usage of grammatical forms in their writing. Furthermore, the study also aimed at finding the students’ perception towards teacher <b>direct</b> <b>written</b> corrective feedback in their writing. The study employed quasi-experimental research design and the data was obtained from a set of pre-test and posttest and also interview. As indicated from the findings from twenty semester one Diploma in Hospitality and Management students from SEGi University, {{the results of the}} study showed that the students of this study bene fitted from teacher <b>direct</b> <b>written</b> corrective feedback and showed improvement in the usage of some grammatical forms which were articles, conjunction and pronoun.

The findings were hoped to shed light in the importance of the practice of giving feedback to students’ writing...|$|R

To me the so-called revelations of Buddha, Gautama, Christ, were the vague dreams of the heart-sick, the stricken mourners of the earth--not one of them brought a beam of hope--but in this modern spirit of experimentation, in the work of Crookes and his like, I see a ray of light. Your mother's impersonations of my wife, her messages--Voices--may be due to mind-reading, to clairvoyance, but the method of their delivery certainly lies beyond any known law.

40|$|A new {{and highly}} {{versatile}} domain patterning method-ultraviolet <b>direct</b> <b>write</b> metal enhanced redox (UV <b>direct</b> <b>write</b> MER) -achieves deep domains with practically no thermally-induced {{damage on the}} surface of lithium niobate crystals. In UV <b>direct</b> <b>write</b> MER, after coating with a thin layer of chromium, the domain inversion is generated by a redox process induced in the crystal by illumination with high intensity UV in an ambient dry nitrogen atmosphere. This new technique enables the fabrication of practical piezoelectric acoustic superlattice structures on 128 ° YX-cut LiNbO 3, the most widely used crystal cut for surface acoustic wave applications. For example, UV <b>direct</b> <b>write</b> MER was used to form an acoustic superlattice 128 ° YX structure that in turn enabled the generation of surface acoustic waves of sufficient strength to develop fluid flow within a droplet of water, demonstrating its potential in practical microfluidic manipulation. This is the first demonstration of a UV <b>direct</b> <b>write</b> surface acoustic wave transducer reported to date, made possible only due to the unique qualities of the MER domain engineering process...|$|R

He forgot the marvels of the <b>direct</b> <b>writing,</b> the mighty murmuring wind, the dream-face of Altair; all these insubstantial and evanescent perceptions were lost, submerged by the returning sea of his doubt. He saw, too, that Leo's faith was shaken. He felt it beneath her brave-spoken words. The whole question of the process, {{as well as the}} content of the messages, was reopened for her. His situation grew ever darker. His way was again blocked. He could not leave his mother to her fate, and yet he could not see his way to earning a cent of money while this horrible accusation was hanging over her. He acknowledged, too, a very definite feeling of sympathy with those who had been defrauded. There was moral indignation in Miss Aiken's tremulous eagerness to punish. [...] "She's not to blame," [...] he said. [...] "I'd do exactly as she is doing if I were in her place." ...|$|E
60|$|Whilst these proofs were in {{the press}} a second very marked case of a Polter-geist came within my knowledge. I cannot without breach of {{confidence}} reveal the details and the phenomena are still going on. Curiously enough, it was {{because one of the}} sufferers from the invasion read some remarks of mine upon the Cheriton dugout that this other case came to my knowledge, for the lady wrote to me at once for advice and assistance. The place is remote and I have not yet been able to visit it, but from the full accounts which I have now received it seems to present all the familiar features, with the phenomenon of <b>direct</b> <b>writing</b> superadded. Some specimens of this script have reached me. Two clergymen have endeavoured to mitigate the phenomena, which are occasionally very violent, but so far without result. It may be some consolation to any others who may be suffering from this strange infliction, to know that in the many cases which have been carefully recorded there is none in which any physical harm has been inflicted upon man or beast.|$|E

I cannot for a single instant accept what {{happened}} last night as the manifestation of the disembodied. I cannot think that the phenomena exist. I must rather think they were performed by Clarke, or my sister, or Weissmann, in joke." [...] She looked at him with an expression of horror, of incredulity, and he went on, quickly: [...] "Even if I admitted the fact of <b>direct</b> <b>writing</b> or the movement of the horn, I should not by any means be driven to accept your spirit-hypothesis. There are men, and very great investigators, who would say that your daughter's trances and all phenomena connected therewith were pathologic, explainable on the grounds of some obscure neural derangement. I do not say this is the case, but I do say that if she persists in these practices she will lose control of her mental faculties. I have had a consultation to-day with Dr. Tolman, a man who makes a specialty of such cases, and when I had laid the whole matter before him, he and Dr. Weissmann both advised the immediate stopping of these trances." ...|$|E
