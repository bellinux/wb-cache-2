5|$|At {{least one}} of the hazard maps {{published}} in the prominent El Espectador newspaper in Bogotá included glaring errors. Without proper graphic scaling, it was unclear how big the map's hazard zones really were. The lahars on the map did not have a distinct ending point, and the main threat seemed to be from pyroclastic flows, not from mudflows. Though the map was colored blue, green, red, and yellow, there was no key to indicate what each color represented, and Armero was located in the <b>green</b> <b>zone</b> (believed to indicate the safest area.|$|E
5|$|Saddam Hussein {{claimed that}} Aflaq had {{converted}} to Islam {{prior to his}} death – according to nameless Western diplomats. This claim was later disputed by nameless members of Aflaq's own family - although Aflaq's son Iyad confirmed that his father thought about conversion already in 1980. Upon his disputed conversion {{he had taken the}} first name of Ahmad. According to the German orientalists Martin Robbe and Gerhard Höpp the conversion happened before 1988. Even so, Aflaq was given an Islamic funeral. For the Berkley Center, Aflaq's disputed conversion is considered by anonymous members of his family as a tool used by Saddam Hussein to disassociate Ba'athism from Christianity. The tomb constructed on the orders of Hussein was later used by American soldiers after the 2003 American invasion of Iraq as a military barracks for troops stationed within the <b>Green</b> <b>Zone.</b>|$|E

25|$|On {{the same}} day, a joint U.S. and Iraqi {{military}} force (Iraqi elements {{drawn from the}} 11th Division) moved into the southern suburbs of Sadr City, provoking heavy street fighting as militiamen opened fire with RPGs and automatic weapons. Two Iraqi Army armored vehicles and two trucks were destroyed and one U.S. Stryker armored personnel carrier was damaged. U.S. Apache helicopters provided air support during the battle, launching Hellfire missiles at militiamen and their vehicles. The U.S. military reported nine militiamen were killed in one such air strike around 8 a.m. after militiamen attacked Iraqi troops with RPGs. The raid {{was a part of}} an attempt to stop mortar and rocket fire on the <b>Green</b> <b>Zone</b> by seizing neighborhoods in Sadr City used as launching points by the Mahdi Army, Rockets and mortar fire continued to fall on the <b>Green</b> <b>Zone</b> and U.S. military bases around the capital.

25|$|Search and {{recovery}} operations {{were conducted by}} federal, state, and local agencies, as well as government contractors. An HH-60 helicopter of the New York Air National Guard saw the explosion from approximately eight miles away, and arrived on scene so quickly that debris was still raining down, and the aircraft had to pull away. They reported their sighting to the tower at Suffolk County Airport (now Gabreski ANG Base). Remote-operated vehicles (ROVs), side-scan sonar, and laser line-scanning equipment were used to search for and investigate underwater debris fields. Victims and wreckage were recovered by scuba divers and ROVs; later scallop trawlers were used to recover wreckage embedded in the ocean floor. In {{one of the largest}} diver-assisted salvage operations ever conducted, often working in very difficult and dangerous conditions, over 95% of the airplane wreckage was eventually recovered. The search {{and recovery}} effort identified three main areas of wreckage underwater. The yellow zone, red zone, and <b>green</b> <b>zone</b> contained wreckage from front, center, and rear sections of the airplane, respectively. The <b>green</b> <b>zone</b> with the aft portion of the aircraft was located the furthest along the flight path.|$|E
25|$|On March 25, an Iraqi {{military}} {{assault was}} launched against {{the port city}} of Basra, which was held by a number of militia groups, but primarily by the Mahdi Army. This led to the collapse of the cease-fire and the continuation of the fighting in Sadr City. Beginning early in the morning of March 25, Mahdi Army militia launched a number of rocket and mortar attacks from Sadr City at US forward operating bases throughout Baghdad, as well as the <b>Green</b> <b>Zone.</b>|$|E

25|$|On May 11, a {{cease-fire}} {{went into effect}} and on May 12 a 14-point agreement was signed between the Iraqi government and representatives of Muqtada al-Sadr, granting Iraqi military forces permission by the Mahdi Army to enter the district to establish security checkpoints and to hunt for rogue militiamen. Under the agreement, the U.S. military would not enter areas of Sadr City north of al-Quds street, but the Mahdi Army promised to stop rocket attacks on U.S. military bases and the <b>Green</b> <b>Zone.</b>|$|E
25|$|In April–June 2008, two brigades of the Iraqi Army 11th Division, {{supported}} by US forces, {{moved into the}} southern third of Sadr City. They were tasked to stop rocket and mortar attacks on US bases and the <b>Green</b> <b>Zone.</b> Following the Siege of Sadr City—a month of fighting—the Mahdi Army agreed to let Iraqi forces into the remaining portion of the city. On May 20, troops from the Iraqi Army 3rd Brigade of the 1st (Iraqi Reaction Force) Division and a brigade from the 9th Division moved into the northern districts of Sadr City and began clearing operations.|$|E
25|$|On March 31 {{the curfew}} {{announced}} by the Iraqi prime minister was lifted {{in most parts of}} the Baghdad following another unilateral ceasefire called by Muqtada al-Sadr. However the curfew remained in effect in Sadr City into April and the ceasefire only lasted until April 6, when US forces, for the first time, started a push into Sadr City, trying to hold the ground gained in an attempt to get the militia mortar teams further away from the <b>Green</b> <b>Zone.</b> The U.S. and Iraqi units were coming under heavy fire as they moved deeper into the neighborhood, engaging anyone that faced them.|$|E
