The {{suitability}} of the sewage effluent from Soba (Khartoum State, Sudan) {{wastewater treatment plant}} for random land disposal and irrigation reuse was assessed during six consecutive years by considering some of its physicochemical and microbiological characteristics. Processing of the available raw data and thereafter comparing them with the locally, regionally and internationally acceptable wastewater quality standards for land disposal, unrestricted and restricted irrigation reuse revealed that: 1 - the design capacity of the plant i. e. the design average flow was established at 31420 m 3 /day. 2 - the effluent under study is well above and violating the allowable recommended standards for random land disposal and irrigation reuse with respect to its mean BOD level (range: 42 - 66 mg/L) and mean total suspended solids level (range: 65 - 87 mg/L). The mean level of the TDS (range 1008 - 1621 mg/L) indicates that the effluent water quality is unsuitable for sustainable irrigation or random <b>disposal</b> <b>on</b> <b>land</b> to avoid secondary salinization. 3 - the pH value of the effluent (range 7. 5 - 8. 3) is within the acceptable quality limits and {{is not expected to}} cause severe problems. 4 - high coliform count (54. 7 x 102 – 7 x 103 MPN / 100 ml 1) was evident in spite of achieving between 92. 4 - 99. 5 % mean removal efficiency which renders the effluent unacceptable for unrestricted irrigation reuse and random <b>disposal</b> <b>on</b> <b>land</b> because of public health hazards aspects.

40|$|Sewage sludge (municipal, or industrial) {{treatment}} {{is still a}} problem in so far {{that it is not}} satisfactorily resolved in terms of cost and final disposal. Two common forms of sludge disposal are possible; the first being direct <b>disposal</b> <b>on</b> <b>land</b> (including agriculture) and the second being incineration (ash production), although neither of these methods are universally applied. Simplifying the issue, direct sludge <b>disposal</b> <b>on</b> <b>land</b> is seldom applied for sanitary and environmental reasons, while incineration is not popular for financial (high costs) reasons. Very often medium and large wastewater treatment plants apply anaerobic digestion for sludge hygiene principles, reducing the amount to be disposed and for biogas (energy) production. With the progress in sewage biological treatment aiming at nutrient removal, primary sludge has been omitted in the working processes and only surplus activated sludge requires handling. Anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge (WAS) is more difficult due to the presence of microorganisms, the decomposition of which requires a relatively long time for hydrolysis. In order to upgrade the hydrolysis effects, several different pre-treatment processes have already been developed and introduced. The additional pre-treatment processes applied are aimed at residual sludge bulk mass minimization, shortening of the anaerobic digestion process or higher biogas production, and therefore require additional energy. The water-energy-waste Nexus (treads of) of the benefits and operational difficulties, including energy costs are discussed in this paper. The intensity of pre-treatment processes to upgrade the microorganism’s hydrolysis has crucial implications. Here a low intensity pre-treatment process, alkalisation and hydrodynamic disintegration - hybrid process - were presented in order to achieve sufficient effects of WAS anaerobic digestion.

In parallel, ecotoxicity of sediment leachates was assessed using standardized bioassays. The results reflected an initial oxidation of sulphides (first year) followed by changes explained by a reversible binding of metals to organic matter in winter and to Fe oxihydroxides in summer. The water-leachable fraction represented less than 2 % of the total metal and its ecotoxicity was higher for deposited sediments than for the fresh one.

Research shows that triclocarban and triclosan have been detected in sewage effluents and sludge (biosolids) due to their incomplete removal during wastewater treatment.

The volume of triclocarban reentering the environment in sewage sludge after initial successful capture from wastewater is s 127,000 ± 194,000 kg/yr. This is equivalent to a 4.8 - 48.2% of its total U.S consumption volume. Crops shown to take up antimicrobials from soil include barley, meadow fescue, carrots and pinto beans.

Digestate from anaerobic digestion plants competes with manure for nutrient <b>disposal</b> <b>on</b> arable <b>land,</b> which forms a serious hinder for the biogas sector {{to develop in}} these regions. Hence, one of its biggest challenges is to find cost-effective and sustainable ways for digestate processing or disposal. Furthermore, primary phosphorus resources are becoming scarce and expensive and will be depleted within a certain time. This urges the need to recycle P from secondary sources, like digestate or manure. From a sustainability point of view, it seems therefore no more than logical that digestate processing techniques switched their focus to nutrient recovery rather than nutrient removal. This paper gives an overview of digestate processing techniques, with a special focus on nutrient recovery techniques. In this paper nutrient recovery techniques are delineated as techniques that (1) create an end-product with higher nutrient concentrations than the raw digestate or (2) separate the envisaged nutrients from organic compounds that are undesirable in the end-product, with the aim to produce an end-product that is fit for use in chemical or fertiliser industry or as a mineral fertiliser replacement.

It also examines which parameters contributed the most to the total emission uncertainty and identified areas of high priority for the further improvement of the accuracy and quality of the inventory. The Monte Carlo analysis resulted in an uncertainty range in total GHG emissions of 4. 1 % in 2004 and 5. 4 % in 1990 (with LUCF) and 5. 3 % (in 1990) and 3. 9 % (in 2004) for GHG emissions without LUCF. Uncertainty in the trend was estimated at 4. 5 %. The values are in the same order of magnitude as those estimated in the Tier 1. The results show that accounting for correlation among parameters is important, and for the Netherlands inventory it has a larger impact on the uncertainty in the trend than on the uncertainty in the total GHG emissions. The main contributors to overall uncertainty are found to be related to N 2 O emissions from agricultural soils, the N 2 O implied emission factors of Nitric Acid Production, CH 4 from managed solid waste <b>disposal</b> <b>on</b> <b>land,</b> and the implied emission factor of CH 4 from manure management from cattle...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decades, {{large amounts of}} {{contaminated}} sediments have been dredged and spread out along rivers. The understanding of the fate and the behaviour of contaminants in dredged sediments is essential {{to deal with the}} management of contaminated sediments. Heavy metal leaching behaviour in dredged sediments of different ages since disposal, varying from 10 to 70 years, was assessed by pH(stat) leaching test and potentiometric titrations. Based on the pH(stat) titration results, two operationally defined pools of heavy metals, i. e., a labile and a slowly labile pool of heavy metals, were distinguished and quantified by mathematical description of leaching behaviour. The mathematical description of leaching behaviour during pH(stat) and potentiometric titrations allowed deduction of four groups of elements with a different type of leaching behaviour. Considering heavy metals, Zn, Cd and Ni displayed a leaching behaviour similar to acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), whereas the release of Cu, Pb and Cr was slower than ANC. However, no significant differences with regard to heavy metal leaching behaviour were found between sediments with different time since <b>disposal</b> <b>on</b> <b>land.</b> The elevated acid neutralizing capacity of the dredged sediments analysed in this study strongly decrease the risk of soil acidification with associated heavy metal leaching.

40|$|Regular {{dredging}} {{is necessary}} for the development of coastal regions and the maintenance of shipping channels. The dredging process dislodges sediments from the seabed, and the removed materials, termed dredged marine soils, are generally considered a geowaste for dumping. However, disposal of the dredged soils offshores can lead to severe and irreversible impact on the marine ecosystem, while <b>disposal</b> <b>on</b> <b>land</b> often incurs exorbitant costs with no guarantee of zero-contamination. It is therefore desirable to reuse the material, and one option is solidification with another industrial waste, that is, steel slag. This paper describes the exploratory work of admixing dredged marine soil with activated steel slag for improvement of the mechanical properties. An optimum activation concentration of NaOH was introduced to the soil-slag mixture for uniform blending. Specimens were prepared at different mix ratios then left to cure for up to 4 weeks. The unconfined compressive strength test was conducted to monitor the changes in strength at predetermined intervals. It was found that the strength does not necessarily increase with higher steel slag content, indicating an optimum slag content required for the maximum solidification effect to take place. Also, regardless of the slag content, longer curing time produces greater strength gain. In conclusion, steel slag addition to dredged sediments can effectively strengthen the originally weak soil structure by both the “cementation” and “filler” effects, though the combined effects were not distinguished in the present study...|$|E

Similarly, water use efficiency of sapling leaves subjected to direct leachate exposure dropped an average of 70 %, while transpiration rates were similar to, and leaf temperatures were 20 % higher than, those found in unirrigated leaves. Spectral patterns of understorey leaves, distorted because of the accumulation of leachate precipitate residues on the adaxial surface, demonstrated increased absorbance in the near infrared waveband and reduced reflection in visible wave-bands compared to abaxial surfaces.

40|$|Processed {{municipal}} sewage sludges (MSS) are an abundant, unwanted by-product of wastewater treatment, increasingly applied to {{agriculture and forestry}} for inexpensive disposal and soil conditioning. Due to their high organic carbon and lipid contents, MSS not only is rich in carbon and nutrients but also represents a “sink” for recalcitrant, hydrophobic, and potentially bioaccumulative compounds. Indeed, many organics sequestered and concentrated in MSS meet the US Environmental Protection Agency’s definition of being persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT). In a strategic effort, our research team at the Biodesign Institute has created the National Sewage Sludge Repository (NSSR), a large repository of digested MSSs from 164 wastewater treatment plants from across the USA, {{as part of the}} Human Health Observatory (H 2 O) at Arizona State University (ASU). The NSSR likely represents the largest archive of digested MSS specimens in the USA. The present study summarizes key findings gleaned thus far from analysis of NSSR samples. For example, we evaluated the content of toxicants in MSS and computed estimates of nationwide inventories of mass produced chemicals that become sequestrated in sludge and later are released into the environment during sludge <b>disposal</b> <b>on</b> <b>land.</b> Ongoing efforts document co-occurrence of a variety of PBT compounds in both MSS and human samples, while also identifying a large number of potentially harmful MSS constituents for which human exposure data are still lacking. Finally, we summarize future opportunities and invite collaborative use of the NSSR by the research community. The H 2 O at ASU represents a new resource and research tool for environmental scientists and the larger research community. As illustrated in this work, this repository can serve to (i) identify and prioritize emerging contaminants, (ii) provide spatial and temporal trends of contaminants, (iii) inform and evaluate the effectiveness of environmental policy-making and regulations, and (iv) approximate, ongoing exposures and body burdens of mass-produced chemicals in human society.

[...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2000 The {{discharge}} of waste into a water resource and its <b>disposal</b> <b>on</b> <b>land</b> can easily cause pollution, {{especially of the}} water resource. However, {{it has long been}} accepted that these activities also form an integral part of a holistic waste management strategy aimed at achieving sustainability. The South African Constitution ensures a basic right to an environment that is not harmful to human health and wellbeing, and states that pollution must be prevented, the environment must be protected, and sustainable use of resources must be promoted, through "reasonable legislative and other measures" [...] The other measures that are currently used by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry to determine whether a waste disposal or discharge action is allowable, are contained in the documents "Procedures to Assess Effluent Discharge Impacts" and "Minimum Requirements for the Handling, Classification, and Disposal of Hazardous Waste". These measures are evaluated to determine whether they are reasonable and effective in distinguishing between sustainable use and pollution in terms of newly promulgated legislation aimed at managing the environment and the water resource. The criteria used for this evaluation are based on the principles of sustainability, the components of risk analysis, and the scientific concepts and principles of waste discharge and disposal management. Based on this evaluation, the shortcomings of current mechanisms are highlighted, and their advantages are incorporated into a proposed integrated regulatory framework for an assessment and decision-making approach based on risk harmonisation, which has various advantageous applications, including: • The identification of cleaner production alternatives; • The identification of an appropriate medium of disposal or discharge (water or land); • The selection of the Best Practical Environmental Option (BPEO) for treatment, disposal or discharge methods; • The licensing of sustainable waste disposal or discharge actions; • The setting of charges for waste discharge activities; • The prioritisation of regulatory intervention; and • The rehabilitation of contaminated areas. The findings of this investigation comprise the first step taken in South Africa towards the harmonisation of assessment and decision-making approaches, which could have important implications for integrated waste and environmental management in the future.

The highest gas production amount of 1, 970 mL as well as the highest TVS-reduction of 38. 4 % was observed over a period of 30 days for a F/M-ratio of 1. 5. The later value was then also used in the subsequent batch reactor experiments. Here the maximum gas production rate increased up to 1, 930 ml/d on the initial days and reached a constant methane gas generation level until day 60. SCOD- and VFA- concentration increases also initially, but decreased after day 10 and continued to do so until day 60. At the very end, the cumulative methane gas production (with the optimal F/M-ratio) of the batch experiment was fitted successfully by a three parameter Gompertz kinetics model...|$|R
40|$|Management of {{municipal}} waste, such as biosolids and greenwaste, {{is becoming increasingly}} problematic with the increase and spread of urban populations. Traditionally such urban resources were viewed as wastes and were often discarded to landfill. More recently these waste resources have been combined, composted and returned to land as a soil conditioner. However, several issues including land availability primarily due to concerns of odour {{as well as the}} emission of gases such as ammonia, nitrous oxide and methane limits large scale <b>disposal</b> <b>on</b> <b>land.</b> An alternative way to manage these wastes is to convert them to biochar at a centrally located urban location {{and use it as a}} growing media or as a soil amendment. Biochar is a carbon rich porous solid material, produced as a by-product during thermo-chemical conversion of biomass under anaerobic conditions, at temperatures above 300 °C. Biochar resembles charcoal but is produced from a wider range of feedstocks such as biosolids and manure and unlike charcoal biochar is not aimed for energy applications. Properties of biochar mainly depend on the pyrolysis temperature and choice of feedstock. The biochar used in this study was slow pyrolysis high temperature (650 °C) biochar produced using biosolids and greenwaste in a 2 : 1 ratio on dry mass basis, called as urban biochar (UB) Although many studies have been conducted to investigate the short term effects of biochar in soils, long term impact of biochar on soil properties remains under studied. Furthermore, the studies conducted to date lack a whole system approach, as they have not investigated the soil - plant system, so do not consider major nutrient loss and use pathways such as: leachate, gaseous loss, storage by soil and plant uptake. Considering, the high cost of biochar production, commercial application of biochar is feasible only if the biochar is used for high value production systems, such as the growing media industry. However, there are very limited studies investigating the effects of biochar on physical and chemical properties of growing media. To fill this knowledge gap, in our study, I performed detailed characterization of UB and compared with published values for standard growing media to assess the potential of UB to be used as a growing media substrate. Growing media was then formulated according to the standard industry practice using different rates of UB. To understand the effect of UB on physical and chemical properties of growing media, two laboratory incubation and two glasshouse experiments were conducted. Some key physical and chemical properties tested in the incubation studies were water retention capacity at different matric potential under wetting - drying cycles, air filled porosity, change in bulk density over time, physical breakdown of media particles and nutrient release from UB amended unfertilized growing media mixes. Silverbeet plants were grown in the glasshouse experiment where major nitrogen and phosphorus loss pathways were measured using custom made chambers. Co-composting of UB with food waste was performed to artificially age UB in order to predict long term changes in UB. Suites of chemical and surface analysis were performed to identify the difference between the fresh and aged UB. The fresh and aged UB were then applied to a sandy acidic horticultural soil (Semiaquic Podosol) where important chemical and physical properties were tested to understand nutrient use efficiency and plant growth. The results of comprehensive characterization of urban biochar and comparison of those results with the published data for growing media substrates indicated that urban biochar has potential to be used as growing media substrate. Incubation studies using different rates of UB in growing media showed UB can completely replace peat from growing media and can be used up to 60 % on a volume basis. UB amended media performed better than industry standard media in terms of pH, capacity to supply nutrients, particle size distribution and greater water holding capacity particularly at lower suction when media dries out. Furthermore, UB amended media proved to be more stable than industry standard media in terms of physical and chemical stability even after being exposed to periodic wetting and drying cycles. UB also reduced the loss of both nitrate and phosphate from growing media. For example 60 % UB amended media had 95 % less loss of nitrate and 51 % less loss of phosphate than the media without UB. Co-composting biochar with food waste showed that co-composting can be used as a tool for artificial ageing of UB as it increases biochar surface oxidation (CEC of UB increased by 37 %) and increases the nutrient load of biochar. Addition of 10 % UB in composting also accelerated the composting process and improved the germination index. However, application of co-composted/aged UB to soil resulted in lower plant growth (plant growth in fresh UB amended soil was 74 % higher than co-composted UB amended soil), lower nutrient use efficiency, greater N 2 O emission and lower water holding capacity as compared to soil amended with fresh UB. In conclusion, the present research suggests that i) UB can replace peat and can be used as a growing media substrate when used up to 60 % on volume basis; ii) UB improves physical and chemical properties of growing media; iii) Plants grown in UB amended growing media have better growth and greater nutrient use efficiency than industry standard growing media; iv) Co-composting UB with food waste ages the UB, however, it does not have agronomical benefit when applied to sandy acidic horticultural soils. embarg...|$|E

The fate of sludge-associated viruses was followed during detention of sludge in the lagoon and after application of sludge to land for disposal. While digested sludge was being added to the lagoon, enteroviruses were readily detected in grab samples of sludge from the lagoon. Sludge-associated viruses dropped to low or undetectable levels after <b>disposal</b> of sludge <b>on</b> <b>land</b> and during periods when addition of digested sludge to the lagoon was suspended. Changes in the levels of fecal coliforms in the lagooned sludge paralleled changes in the numbers of enteroviruses. Enteroviruses were not detected in water from deep wells located <b>on</b> the sludge <b>disposal</b> site or near the lagoon. During the initial part of the study, poliovirus serotypes accounted for greater than 90 % of the viruses identified. Later, poliovirus serotypes comprised less than 40 % of the virus isolates, and echoviruses and Coxsackieviruses were the most common enteroviruses identified...|$|R

Environmenal and socio-economic aspects of industrial effluent irrigation have not been studied as extensively as domesticsewage based irrigation practices, at least for developing countries like India. Disposal of treated and untreated industrial effluents <b>on</b> <b>land</b> has become a regular practice for some industries. Industries located in Mettupalayam taluk, Tamilnadu dispose their effluents <b>on</b> <b>land,</b> and the farmers of the adjacen farmlands have complained that their shallow open wells get polluted and also the salt content of soil has started building up slowly. This study attempts to capure the environmental and socio-economic impacts of industrial effluent irrigation in different industrial locations at Mettupalayam taluk through primary surveys and secondary information. This study found that coninuous disposal of industrial effluents <b>on</b> <b>land,</b> which has limited capacity to assimilate the pollution load, has led to groundwater pollution. Ground water quality of shallow open wells surrounding the industrial locations has deteriorated, and the application of polluted groundwater fo irrigation has resulted in increased salt conent of soils. In some locations drinking water wells (deep bore wells) also have high concentration of salts. Since the farmers had already shifted their cropping pattern to salt toleran crops (like jasmine, curry leaf, tobacco etc.) and substituted their irrigation source from shallow open wells to deep bore wells and/or river water the impact of pollution on livelihood was minimised. Since the local administration is supplying drinking water to households the impact in the domestic secor has been minimised. It has also been noticed that in some locations industries are supplying drinking water to the affected households. However, if the pollution continues unabated it could pose serious problems in the future. effluents, groundwater, pollution, salt conent of soils, Mettupalayam, Tamilnadu, India...|$|R
40|$|Apple pomace (AP) is {{the main}} {{by-product}} of apple juice production. It is a residue after pressing of apples for juice extraction. AP is an organic material, with high moisture and sugar content, therefore its direct <b>disposal</b> <b>on</b> landfills or <b>land</b> spreading causes serious environmental pollution. One of the solutions for further exploitation of AP could be its utilization as animal feed. However, fresh AP is quite perishable, {{and it must be}} preserved in order to be stored and used {{over a long period of}} time. The aim of this research was to investigate the possibility to transform AP to a stabile form which would be acceptable for feed manufacturers in terms of stability, storage and handling. For this purpose, pelleting process was used and pelleting properties of AP were evaluated. Before pelleting, dried AP was divided into three batches, which were conditioned only by water addition in order to achieve different moisture contents of the material: 10 % of moisture for the first batch, 13 % for the second batch and 16 % for the third batch. According to the obtained values for Pellet Durability Index (PDI) and pellet hardness, pellet quality for all examined AP batches was very high. Increased moisture content of AP led to the reduction in energy consumption of the pellet press, thus providing energy saving in the pelleting process. Pelleting process also caused strong increase of AP bulk density which is positive in terms of transportation and storage...|$|R
