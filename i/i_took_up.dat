2500|$|After the {{assassination}} of newspaper editor Pedro Chamorro in 1978, Astorga decided {{to take up arms}} against the Somoza regime. [...] "I finally understood that armed struggle was the only solution, that a rifle cannot be met with a flower, that we were in the streets, but if that force didn't get organized we wouldn't achieve much", she said. [...] "For me, it was the moment of conviction: either <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>up</b> arms and made a total commitment or I wasn't going to change anything." ...|$|E

In addition to being an outstanding long jumper, sprinter and high jumper, Fry was also a talented hurdler, once competing against Godfrey Shaw the champion hurdler of the time, who beat him but told him, as Fry later recalled: [...] "He was sure if <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>up</b> hurdling seriously I might win the championship."

2500|$|In late 1969 Clapton {{made the}} switch to the Fender Stratocaster. [...] "I {{had a lot of}} {{influences}} when <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>up</b> the Strat. First there was Buddy Holly, and Buddy Guy. Hank Marvin was the first well known person over here in England who was using one, but that wasn't really my kind of music. Steve Winwood had so much credibility, and when he started playing one, I thought, oh, if he can do it, I can do it". The first—used during the recording of Eric Clapton—was [...] "Brownie", which in 1973 became the backup to the most famous of all Clapton's guitars, [...] "Blackie". In November 1970 Eric bought six Fender Stratocasters from the Sho-bud guitar shop in Nashville, Tennessee while on tour with the Dominos. He gave one each to George Harrison, Steve Winwood, and Pete Townshend.|$|E
2500|$|In news {{interview}}s, Richter {{talked about}} her love of cooking, sewing and raising children, but she also spoke to her yearning to create art. In an April 1960 interview with Jean Reeves in the Buffalo Evening News titled [...] "Amid Houseful of Distractions, Woman Artist Paints on," [...] Richter said, [...] "All my life I {{wanted to be an}} artist. But I fought against it. I'd stand in front of Dad's paintings and I'd think Why try? But they inspired me, too. But it was a lost cause, and I decided that all I really wanted to do was paint, so why fight it? Painting isn't something <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>up</b> as a means of escape from dishes and diapers. The urge to paint was there before any frustration with housework. A serious artist paints because he has to; it's an inborn drive." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wesseltoft {{was born}} in Porsgrunn. After high school in Skien, where he was {{involved}} in the school brass band and dance orchestras, he became a professional musician in 1983 only 19 years old. By the age of 16, he joined a punk rock band, but the influence of the jazz guitarist father, stalked on him. After moving to his father in Oslo (1984), it was mostly music with roots in jazz that mattered, although he also worked as a back-up musician and producer for the pop and rock elite in Norway. He had originally intended to study music, but the gigs were too many, and therefore he never got any further formal musical education. Towards the end of the 1980s Bugge Wesseltoft was involved in a variety of pop, rock and jazz bands like the [...] "U and Z", [...] "Et Cetera" [...] and most important the Oslo Groove Company, and he was recognised as a coming musical genius with a great talent for the piano. This led to collaborations within the Knut Riisnæs Quartet in 1989, and he was soon after contacted by Arild Andersen to join in on the commissioned work for Vossajazz - released on the album Sagn (1990) - and the follow up Arv (1993), and Jan Garbarek for his Molde Canticle (1990), a commission from the Moldejazz, released on the album <b>I</b> <b>Took</b> <b>Up</b> the Runes (1990).|$|E
