5|$|The eSATA {{connector}} is a {{more robust}} SATA connector, intended for connection to external <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> and SSDs. eSATA's transfer rate (up to 6Gbit/s) {{is similar to that}} of USB3.0 (up to 5Gbit/s on current devices; 10Gbit/s speeds via USB3.1, announced on 31 July 2013). A device connected by eSATA appears as an ordinary SATA device, giving both full performance and full compatibility associated with internal drives.|$|E
5|$|According to routine testing {{performed}} by CNet, write operations to typical Hi-Speed <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> can sustain rates of 25–30MB/s, while read operations are at 30–42MB/s; this is 70% {{of the total}} available bus bandwidth. For USB3.0, typical write speed is 70–90MB/s, while read speed is 90–110MB/s. Mask tests, also known as eye diagram tests, are {{used to determine the}} quality of a signal in the time domain. They are defined in the referenced document as part of the electrical test description for the high-speed (HS) mode at 480Mbit/s.|$|E
5|$|The {{boron nitride}} nanomesh {{is not only}} stable to {{decomposition}} under vacuum, air and some liquids, but also up to temperatures of 800°C. In addition, it shows the extraordinary ability to trap molecules and metallic clusters which have similar sizes to the nanomesh pores, forming a well-ordered array. These characteristics promise interesting applications of the nanomesh in areas like catalysis, surface functionalisation, spintronics, quantum computing and data storage media like <b>hard</b> <b>drives.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hot swapping: using a {{computer}} to change the data on the <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> This requires having the Xbox unlock the <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> when it is turned on, then swapping the powered <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> into a running computer. By using a Linux-based Live CD, data on the <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> can be read, altered, and deleted. In most cases, an automated script will automatically install the softmod files directly to the Xbox <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> This technique has been used extensively to harbor cheating on many online games. Disassembly of the console is required to perform a hot swap.|$|R

5|$|These {{and other}} {{differences}} reflect the differing design {{goals of the}} two buses: USB was designed for simplicity and low cost, while FireWire was designed for high performance, particularly in time-sensitive applications such as audio and video. Although similar in theoretical maximum transfer rate, FireWire400 is faster than USB2.0 high-bandwidth in real-use, especially in high-bandwidth use such as external <b>hard</b> <b>drives.</b> The newer FireWire800 standard is {{twice as fast as}} FireWire400 and faster than USB2.0 high-bandwidth both theoretically and practically. However, FireWire's speed advantages rely on low-level techniques such as direct memory access (DMA), which in turn have created opportunities for security exploits such as the DMA attack.|$|E
5|$|Hirst {{received}} little coaching as a batsman. Physically brave, {{he was often}} at his best on pitches which were difficult for batting, and when his team faced a crisis. His usual approach was to bat aggressively. Although he could play defensively if required, he preferred to attack when his team were in difficulties. He played a variety of strokes, but he favoured the on drive and particularly the pull and hook shots. He was able to pull and hook almost any ball delivered to him, {{making it difficult to}} place fielders effectively while he was batting. Only in Australia did this approach prove less successful. He also established a reputation as an outstanding fielder at mid off. In this position, he took many catches, often from <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> in an era when batsmen played this shot very well.|$|E
5|$|The {{magneto-optical}} drive manufactured by Canon Inc. {{was used as}} the primary mass storage device. These drives were relatively new to the market, and the NeXT was the first computer to use them. They were cheaper than <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> (blank media especially so: though each had a cost of $150 to Canon, Jobs's typically forthright negotiations saw Canon agree to a retail of only $50 apiece) but slower (with an average seek time of 96 ms). The design made it impossible to move files between computers without a network, since each NeXT Computer had only one MO drive and the disk could not be removed without shutting down the system. Storage options proved challenging for the first NeXT Computers. The magneto-optical media was relatively expensive and had performance and reliability problems despite being faster than a floppy drive. The drive was not sufficient to run as the primary medium running the NeXTSTEP operating system both in terms of speed and capacity.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} season, Nikita gains some allies {{to aid in}} her fight against Division, {{including}} Owen Elliot (Devon Sawa), a guardian to one of Division's several black boxes; <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> contain files of Division's missions, until Percy tried to have him killed, CIA analyst Ryan Fletcher (Noah Bean) who was investigating black operations invisible to the United States government, and eventually her trainer Michael, after he learns Percy {{was responsible for the}} deaths of his wife and daughter. The two would be in a relationship for the rest of the series' run. By the first-season finale, Alex learns that Nikita killed her father and leaves her to become a free agent for Amanda (Melinda Clarke), Division's psychologist who overthrew Percy to lead Division with the help of Oversight, a group of American politicians who ensure that Division's existence remains secret from the public (Alex would later return to fight alongside with Nikita again midway through season two). Michael is discovered to be working with Nikita and the two end up on the run together with a black box.|$|E

25|$|One {{more recent}} {{application}} for flash memory is {{as a replacement}} for hard disks. Flash memory does not have the mechanical limitations and latencies of <b>hard</b> <b>drives,</b> so a solid-state drive (SSD) is attractive when considering speed, noise, power consumption, and reliability. Flash drives are gaining traction as mobile device secondary storage devices; they are also used as substitutes for <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> in high-performance desktop computers and some servers with RAID and SAN architectures.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{solid-state}} memory, <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> {{are susceptible}} to damage by shock (e.g., a short fall) and vibration, have limitations on use at high altitude, and although they are shielded by their casings, they are vulnerable when exposed to strong magnetic fields. In terms of overall mass, <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> are usually larger and heavier than flash drives; however, hard disks sometimes weigh less per unit of storage. Like flash drives, hard disks also suffer from file fragmentation, which can reduce access speed.|$|E
50|$|Some {{computer}} appliances use {{solid state}} storage, while others use a <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> to load an operating system. Again, the two methods might be mixed—an ASIC print server might allow an optional <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> for job queueing, or a Linux-based device may encode Linux in firmware, {{so that a}} <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> is not needed to load the operating system.|$|R

25|$|Win32/FakeSysdef manifests as {{one or more}} of {{an array}} of {{programs}} that purport to scan one's computer for hardware failures related to system memory, <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> and system functionality as a whole. They scan the computer, show false hardware issues, and present a remedy to defrag the <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> and fine-tune the system performance. They then request the user to make a payment in order to activate the program so the user can download the new updates and to repair the hardware issues.|$|E
25|$|Particularly {{with the}} advent of USB, {{external}} hard disks have become widely available and inexpensive. External hard disk drives currently cost less per gigabyte than flash drives and are available in larger capacities. Some <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> support alternative and faster interfaces than USB 2.0 (e.g., IEEE 1394 and eSATA). For consecutive sector writes and reads (for example, from an unfragmented file), most <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> can provide a much higher sustained data rate than current NAND flash memory, though mechanical latencies seriously impact hard drive performance.|$|E
25|$|The core idea of ReadyBoost {{is that a}} {{flash memory}} (e.g. a USB flash drive or an SSD) have a much faster seek time than a typical {{magnetic}} hard disk (less than 1ms), allowing it to satisfy requests faster than reading files from the hard disk. It also leverages the inherent advantage of two parallel sources from which to read data, whereas Windows 7 {{enables the use of}} up to eight flash drives at once, allowing up to nine parallel sources. USB 2.0 flash drives are slower for sequential reads and writes than modern desktop <b>hard</b> <b>drives.</b> Desktop <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> can sustain anywhere from 2 to 10 times the transfer speed of USB 2.0 flash drives but are equal to or slower than USB 3.0 and Firewire (IEEE 1394) for sequential data. USB 2.0 and faster flash drives have faster random access times: typically around 1ms, compared to 12ms for mainstream desktop <b>hard</b> <b>drives.</b>|$|E
