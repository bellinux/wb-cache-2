However, over the past 20 years, research has revealed an extraordinary array of endothelial functions, including control over coagulation, fibrinolysis, arterial tone and vascular growth. Importantly, endothelial dysfunction has been implicated as a key event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, coronary vasoconstriction and, probably, myocardial ischemia. The recent demonstration that endothelial dysfunction may be reversible raises the possibility of slowing the progression of atherosclerosis or modifying arterial function, or both, to decrease the risk of acute cardiovascular events...|$|E
40|$|Progesterone {{released}} from the cumulus cells of the oocyte causes a number of physiological responses in human sperm cells including hyperactivation, acrosome reaction and chemotaxis. We employed a validated sperm mobility assay, which involves measuring the ability of sperm to penetrate an <b>inert</b> <b>cell</b> separation solution over time, to assess the ability of progesterone to enhance the mobility of boar spermatozoa. Cells maximally penetrate the solution over 50 minutes. 100 nM progesterone significantly (P = 0. 01) increased the mobility of non-capacitated sperm cells causing a doubling in {{the rate at which}} the cells penetrated through the cell separation solution (control half maximal penetration rate [Km] = 18. 0 ± 2. 2; + 100 nM progesterone Km = 8. 8 ± 0. 8 min). Similarly, capacitated cells penetrated at a rate (Km = 19. 2 ± 3. 0 min) not significantly different from non-capacitated cells and 100 nM progesterone also significantly increased the rate of penetration of capacitated cells (Km = 9. 5 ± 1. 0 min, P< 0. 05). The T-type voltage gated calcium channel blocker mibefradil (30 mM) significantly inhibited both the control and progesterone enhanced mobility in non-capacitated and capacitated sperm. Only capacitated cells showed a significant increase in the acrosome reaction in response to 100 nM progesterone (control non-reacted = 75 ± 4 %, + 100 nM progesterone non-reacted = 47 ± 10 %). Western blot analysis confirmed that there was an increase in the total protein tyrosine phosphorylation levels in capacitated cells. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that 100 nM progesterone accelerates the mobility of boar sperm cells through an <b>inert</b> <b>cell</b> separation solution in an extracellular calcium dependent manner...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} cytochemical changes were {{revealed}} by microscopic observations of Aerobacter aerogenes populations starving for Mg++. During {{the first few}} hours, while the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was paralleled {{by an increase in}} viable bacteria, the cells became progressively smaller. Subsequently, the number of viable cells in the culture remained constant in spite of continuing DNA synthesis, and the cells progressively elongated into filamentous forms. During this time, a second population of very small bacteria could be identified. These cells, whose number increased progressively, were inert with respect to (i) growth or reproduction when returned to a complete medium and (ii) biosynthetic activity as judged by autoradiographic estimation of uracil-H 3 incorporation into nucleic acids. When observed by electron microscopy, many thin sections from bacteria that had been starved of Mg++ for 20 hr appeared to be almost devoid of ribosomal particles. Thionine staining indicated that the <b>inert</b> <b>cells</b> contain DNA.

40|$|Adipose {{tissue is}} not an <b>inert</b> <b>cell</b> mass {{contributing}} only to the storage of fat, but a sophisticated ensemble of cellular components with highly specialized and complex functions. In addition to managing the most important energy reserve of the body, it secretes a multitude of soluble proteins called adipokines, which have beneficial or, alternatively, deleterious effects on the homeostasis of the whole body. The expression of these adipokines is an integrated response to various signals received from many organs, which depends heavily on the integrity and physiological status of the adipose tissue. One of the main regulators of gene expression in fat is the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), which is a fatty acid- and eicosanoid-dependent nuclear receptor that plays key roles {{in the development and}} maintenance of the adipose tissue. Furthermore, synthetic PPARgamma agonists are therapeutic agents used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. This review discusses recent knowledge on the link between fat physiology and metabolic diseases, and the roles of PPARgamma in this interplay via the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. Finally, we assess the putative benefits of targeting this nuclear receptor with still-to-be-identified highly selective PPARgamma modulators...|$|E

In whole plant labeling experiments, allocation of photosynthate from a pulse of 14 CO 2 into polymeric compounds was: 25 % to proteins in 4 days, 20 % to metabolically <b>inert</b> <b>cell</b> wall products in 1 to 2 days, 10 % to lipids in 4 days, and 4 % to starch in 1 day. The amount of 14 C labeled photosynthate that an actively growing leaf (leaf 4) used {{for its own}} lipid synthesis immediately following pulse labeling was about 25 %. The 14 C of labeled proteins turned over with half-lives of 3. 8, 3. 3, and 4. 1 days in leaves 1, 2, and 3, respectively; and turnover of 14 C in total shoot protein proceeded with a half-life of 5. 2 days.

40|$|Background-—Microparticles (MPs) are {{circulating}} membrane {{particles of}} less than a micrometer in diameter shed from endothelial and blood cells. Recent literature suggests that MPs are not just functionally <b>inert</b> <b>cell</b> debris but may possess biological functions and mediate the communication between vascular cells. As {{a significant proportion of}} MPs originate from platelets and endothelial cells, we hypothesized that MPs may harbor functional enzymes including an endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Methods and Results-—Using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis, we found that human circulating MPs carry an eNOS. Ca 2 + and L-arginine-dependent NOS activity of crude enzyme extract from MPs was determined by measuring the conversion of [3 H]-L-arginine to [3 H]-citrulline and NOS-dependent nitrite production. NOS-dependent NO production in intact MPs was assessed by the NO-specific fluorescent probe MNIP-Cu. In patients with cardiovascular disease, endothelial dysfunction was associated with an increase in the total number of circulating MPs as well as a significant decrease in the expression and activity of eNOS in MPs. No difference in reactive oxygen species was noted in MPs isolated from either group. Conclusions-—Our data further support the concept that circulating MPs may not only retain phenotypic markers but also preserve the functionality of enzymes of the cells they originate from, including eNOS.

LAF not only enhances the mitotic responses of the less dense thymus subpopulations (A, B, and C) separable on discontinuous bovine serum albumin (BSA) gradients but also gives substantial responses in the otherwise <b>inert</b> <b>cells</b> of the denser fractions D and P. LAF does not exert a potentiating stimulatory effect on the responses of unfractionated mouse spleen cells, but does act synergistically with PHA on nonadherent spleen cells and on spleen cells of mice of several strains 5 days after irradiation and injection of thymocytes. Similarly LAF, which has no visible effect on unfractionated human peripheral blood cells, strongly potentiates the PHA response of column-purified lymphocytes, when these are cultured at low concentration.

40|$|Abstract—Cells {{of various}} types release small {{membrane}} vesicles called microparticles (MP) on their activation, as well as {{during the process of}} apoptosis. The properties and roles of MP generated in different contexts are diverse and are determined by their parent cell and the pathway of their generation, which affects their content. MP are involved in multiple cellular functions, including immunomodulation, inflammation, coagulation, and intercellular communication. MP are able to deliver molecular signals in the form of lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, or functional transmembrane proteins from the parent cell to distantly located targets. In this review, we summarize some of the current knowledge regarding MP and their functional roles in transfer of proteins, nucleic acids, and signal transduction stimulators between cells of different origins in different settings. We will focus on the ability of MP to mediate angiogenesis-related signals and their effect on cell development. The investigation of MP could elucidate new cellular communication pathways and may lead to better understanding of pathophysiological processes. From a clinical point of view, MP may serve as biomarkers for disease status and may be found useful for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting angiogenesis-related conditions.

Viral vectors, based on the Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) type 2, have {{emerged as one of the}} most promising types of vectors for therapeutic applications due to excellent transduction efficiencies of a broad variety of dividing and mitotically <b>inert</b> <b>cell</b> types and due to their unique safety features. Results We designed recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors for the regulated expression of transgenes in different configurations. We integrated the macrolide-responsive E. REX systems (E ON and E OFF) into rAAV backbones and investigated the delivery and expression of intracellular as well as secreted transgenes for binary set-ups and for self- and auto-regulated one-vector configurations. Extensive quantitative analysis of an array of vectors revealed a high level of adjustability as well as tight transgene regulation with low levels of leaky expression, both crucial for therapeutical applications. We tested the performance of the different vectors in selected biotechnologically and therapeutically relevant cell types (CHO-K 1, HT- 1080, NHDF, MCF- 7). Moreover, we investigated key characteristics of the systems, such as reversibility and adjustability to the regulating agent, to determine promising candidates for in vivo studies. To validate the functionality of delivery and regulation we performed in vivo studies by injecting particles, coding for compact self-regulated expression units, into mice and adjusting trans{{gene expression}}.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that anergic T cells may not be only <b>inert</b> <b>cells</b> but may rather play an active role, for example by regulating immune responses. We have previously reported the existence of “anergic” IL- 10 -producing CD 4 + T cells generated in vivo by continuous antigenic stimulation. Using a gene transfer system where the antigen recognized by such T cells is expressed in skeletal muscle by two different DNA viral vectors, we show that these cells not only remain tolerant toward their cognate antigen but also can suppress the immune response of naïve T cells against the immunogenic adenoviral proteins. Furthermore, they can completely inhibit tissue destruction that takes place {{as a result of an}} immune response. The system presented here is unique in that the T cells have been anergized in vivo, their antigen specificity and functional status are known, and the amount, form, and timing of antigen expression can be manipulated. This model will therefore permit us to carefully dissect the mechanisms by which these anergic T cells regulate the priming and/or effector function of naïve T cells...|$|R

Based on a rational design where the extracellular domains of dimeric erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) or gp 130 were substituted with heterodimeric VH/VL regions of anti-hen egg lysozyme (HEL) antibody and EpoR D 2 domains, the genes encoding the chimeras {{as well as a}} model transgene, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), were retrovirally infected into IL- 3 -dependent Ba/F 3 cells followed by direct HEL selection in the absence of IL- 3.

The beneficial effects of cardiosphere-derived cells are {{mediated by the}} secretion of exosomes and possibly other extracellular membrane vesicles (EMVs). ObjectivesThis study sought to investigate the effect of cardiosphere-derived EMVs (CSp-EMVs) on fibroblasts in vitro and tested whether priming with CSp-EMVs could confer salutary properties on fibroblasts in vivo. MethodsCSp-EMVs were isolated from serum-free media conditioned for 3 days by cardiospheres. Dermal fibroblasts were primed with CSp-EMVs for 24 h followed by exosomal micro-ribonucleic acid profiling. In vivo, we injected CSp-EMV−primed or −unprimed dermal fibroblasts (or CSp-EMVs) in a chronic rat model of myocardial infarction and defined the functional and structural consequences. ResultsCSp-EMVs amplified their own biological signals: exposure of “inert” fibroblasts to CSp-EMVs rendered the fibroblasts therapeutic. Intramyocardially injected CSp-EMV−primed (but not unprimed) fibroblasts increased global pump function and vessel density while reducing scar mass. CSp-EMV priming caused fibroblasts to secrete much higher levels of stromal-cell-derived factor 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor and dramatically changed the micro-ribonucleic acid profile of fibroblast-secreted EMVs in vitro. The priming was followed by significant angiogenic and cardioprotective effects. ConclusionsCSp-EMVs alter fibroblast phenotype and secretome in a salutary positive-feedback loop.

40|$|Aggregation of dissociated sponge cells {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as a model for}} cell-cell recognition mediated by a specific proteoglycan aggregation factor (Microciona aggregation factor). To test whether sponge cells undergo stimulus-response coupling in which intracellular Ca is a messenger, aggregation of mechanically dissociated cells was studied. Changes in light transmission through cell suspensions paralleled aggregation as judged by microscopy. In the presence, but not absence, of Ca (> 5 mM) partially purified Microciona aggregation factor aggregated both living and glutaraldehyde-fixed cells. Evidence for a messenger role of Ca was the following: (i) Addition of Ca to Ca-depleted cells induced aggregation that varied with [Ca]. (ii) Addition of Ca ionophores (A 23187 and ionomycin) caused aggregation that varied with [Ca] and far exceeded that provoked by Ca alone. Glutaraldehyde-fixed cells did not respond to ionophores with or without Ca. (iii) Calcium antagonists inhibited aggregation. These included inhibitors of the Ca-calmodulin complex (N-(6 -aminohexyl) - 5 -chloro- 1 -naphthalenesulfonamide hydrochloride and 1 -[bis(p-chlorophenyl) methyl]- 3 -[2, 4 -dichloro-β-(2, 4 -dichlorobenzyloxyl) phenylethyl]imidazolinium chloride), Ca channel blockers (La, Co, Cd, and verapamil), and three nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (indomethacin, ibuprofen, and piroxicam). Results indicated not only that early events of sponge aggregation can be quantified by continuous recording but that aggregation is not simply due to passive agglutination of <b>inert</b> <b>cells</b> by an extracellular proteoglycan.

40|$|Obesity is a {{condition}} characterized by excess adipose tissue that results from positive energy balance and {{is the most common}} metabolic disorder in the industrialized world. The obesity epidemic shows no sign of slowing, and it is increasingly a global problem. Serious clinical problems associated with obesity include an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Hence, understanding the origin and development of adipocytes and adipose tissue will be critical to the analysis and treatment of metabolic diseases. Historically, albeit incorrectly, adipocytes were thought to be <b>inert</b> <b>cells</b> whose singular function was lipid storage. It is now known that adipocytes have other critical functions; the most important include sensitivity to insulin and the ability to produce and secrete adipocyte-specific endocrine hormones that regulate energy homeostasis in other tissues. Today, adipocytes are recognized as critical regulators of whole-body metabolism and known {{to be involved in the}} pathogenesis of a variety of metabolic diseases. All cells come from other cells and many cells arise from precursor cells. Adipocytes are not created from other adipocytes, but they arise from precursor cells. In the last two decades, scientists have discovered the function of many proteins that influence the ability of precursor cells to become adipocytes. If the expansion of the adipose tissue is the problem, it seems logical that adipocyte development inhibitors could be a viable anti-obesity therapeutic. However, factors that block adipocyte development and limit adipocyte expansion also impair metabolic health. This notion may be counterintuitive, but several lines of evidence support the idea that blocking adipocyte development is unhealthy. For this reason it is clear that we need a better understanding of adipocyte development...|$|R

Yet their major progeny are immunologically unresponsive thymocytes in spite of having acquired TCR-CD 3 and CD 4 -CD 8. Because only mature thymocytes migrate to peripheral lymphoid organs and most thymocytes die in situ, {{the knowledge of the}} events associated with functional maturation in the double-negative thymocyte progeny is a fundamental question in T cell development. We reasoned that a clue to trace the fate of early human thymocytes may perhaps come from the study of the developmental acquisition of CD 1 antigen, currently used to define better the functionally inert CD 4 + 8 + (double-positive) stage and absent in mature, medullary thymocytes and peripheral T cells. By using antibodles specific for CD 1 (HTA 1 /T 6) we show here that a large fraction of double-negative thymocytes also express CD 1. CD 1 + 3 −, CD 1 + 3 +, CD 1 − 3 +, and CD 1 − 3 − subsets all exist. The CD 1 + 3 − subset generates CD 1 + 3 − 4 − 8 + precursors of CD 1 + double-positive cells. A large portion of the CD 1 + 3 + subset bears TCRγδ-CD 3 complexes. The CD 1 − subsets are responsive in assays of function, in which they can be stimulated to use the interleukin 2 pathway of prollferation and to mediate cytotoxicity. in contrast, all CD 1 + thymocytes behave as functionally <b>inert</b> <b>cells.</b> Thus, the CD 1 surface marker delineates human thymocyte precursors and their products which lack, or possess, functional potential in vitro, on both αβ and γδ lineage...|$|R

During stimulation with 15 mM glucose, 20 % of isolated <b>cells</b> were <b>inert,</b> whereas 80 % showed [Ca 2 +]i oscillations of variable amplitude, duration and frequency. Spectral analysis identified a major frequency of 0. 14 min− 1 and a less prominent one of 0. 27 min− 1. In contrast, practically all clusters (2 – 50 cells) responded to glucose, and no <b>inert</b> <b>cells</b> were identified within the clusters. As compared to single cells, mean [Ca 2 +]i was more elevated, [Ca 2 +]i oscillations were more regular and their major frequency was slightly higher (but reached a plateau at ≈ 0. 25 min− 1). In some cells and clusters, faster oscillations occurred {{on top of the}} slow ones, between them or randomly. Image analysis revealed that the regular [Ca 2 +]i oscillations were well synchronized between all cells of the clusters. Even when the Ca 2 + response was irregular, slow and fast [Ca 2 +]i oscillations induced by glucose were also synchronous in all cells. In contrast, [Ca 2 +]i oscillations resulting from mobilization of intracellular Ca 2 + by acetylcholine were restricted to certain cells only and were not synchronized. Heptanol and 18 α-glycyrrhetinic acid, two agents widely used to block gap junctions, altered glucose-induced Ca 2 + oscillations, but control experiments showed that they also exerted effects other than a selective uncoupling of the cells. The results support theoretical models predicting an increased regularity of glucose-dependent oscillatory events in clusters as compared to isolated islet cells, but contradict the proposal that the frequency of the oscillations increases with the number of coupled cells. Islet cell clusters function better as electrical than biochemical syncytia. This may explain the co-ordination of [Ca 2 +]i oscillations driven by depolarization-dependent Ca 2 + influx during glucose stimulation...|$|R

40|$|Understanding human mesenchymal {{stem cell}} (hMSC) {{adhesion}} and differentiation in three-dimensional matrices in vitro is important for potential regenerative medicine and stem cell therapies. One of the key requirements {{for the use of}} scaffolds is that they correctly display the physicochemical properties mimicking those of the native extracellular matrix (ECM), in particular adhesive heterogeneity. Previous studies in 2 D provide evidence for the effects of matrix properties such as stiffness, topography and surface chemistry. Yet, there are very few examples to date where ECM heterogeneity has been recapitulated and its effects on hMSCs investigated. The main aim of this research was to design topologically defined three-dimensional porous scaffolds. This was achieved by exploiting the self-assembly of amphiphilic diblock copolymers confined at an interface. Two methods of scaffold fabrication were used in these studies; high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) templating and electrospinning. In both studies, mixtures of two amphiphilic block copolymers were used to induce phase separation between the dissimilar hydrophilic blocks thereby creating distinct copolymer domains in the nanometer length scales on the scaffold surface. In both scaffold fabrication methods the amphiphilic block copolymers used were a combination of <b>cell</b> <b>inert</b> and <b>cell</b> adhesive chemistries, thereby generating matrices with distinct cell binding sites. The functionality and adhesive heterogeneity of these materials were characterised using varying techniques including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, chemical force spectroscopy mapping and contact angle measurements. The effect of adhesive heterogeneity of such matrices on human mesenchymal progenitor adhesion and differentiation based on block copolymer domains were investigated. It was found that hMSCs adhered in a block copolymer dependent manner to scaffolds that most closely mimicked the adhesive heterogeneity in native extracellular matrix. ...|$|R

The importance of cell death as a factor limiting producti-vity of cell culture methods is emphasized. ENCAPSULATION {{is the process of}} making capsules using certain controlled chemical reactions. Bioencapsulation takes advantage of this fundamental principle and effec-tively involves putting a living core inside a membr ne which is essentially <b>inert,</b> non-toxic to <b>cells</b> and stable t...|$|R
40|$|The malaria-causing {{parasite}} Plasmodium falciparum {{employs a}} salvage pathway for the biosynthesis of nucleotides, {{in contrast to}} de novo biosynthesis that is utilized by the human host. A series of twenty-two 2 -, 6 - and 5 '-modified adenosine ribonucleosides was synthesized, {{with the expectation that}} these compounds would generate toxic metabolites instead of active nucleotides by the pathogen, while remaining <b>inert</b> in host <b>cells.</b> Bioassays with P. falciparum (K 1 strain) indicated IC 50 values as low as 110 nM and a selectivity index with respect to cytotoxicity toward an L 6 rat myoblast cell line of > 1000 for the most potent analogue...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn yeast strains {{bearing the}} point {{mutation}} called GAL 11 P (for potentiator), certain GAL 4 derivatives lacking any classical activating region work as strong activators. The P mutation confers upon GAL 11, {{a component of}} the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, the ability to interact with a portion of the dimerization region of GAL 4. The region of GAL 11 affected by the P mutation is evidently functionally <b>inert</b> in ordinary <b>cells,</b> suggesting that this mutation is of no functional significance beyond creating an artificial target for the GAL 4 dimerization fragment. From these observations and further analyses of GAL 11, we propose that a single activator-holoenzyme contact can trigger gene activation simply by recruiting the latter to DNA...|$|R
40|$|Whereas {{defective}} interfering {{particles of}} Sindbis virus are readily produced in BHK- 21 cells or chicken embryo fibroblasts by {{the techniques of}} serial undiluted passage, similar methods failed to generate such particles in Aedes albopictus cell cultures. In addition, Sindbis virus stocks produced in BHK- 21 cells or chicken embryo fibroblasts and which contained defective interfering particles, when tested in A. albopictus cells, failed (i) {{to interfere with the}} replication of standard Sindbis virus and (ii) to change the pattern of intracellular viral RNA synthesis from that produced by infection with standard Sindbis virus alone. We conclude that defective interfering particles of Sindbis virus generated in chicken or hamster cells are silent or <b>inert</b> in mosquito <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a new method for selective cell targeting {{based on the}} use of light-absorbing microparticles and nanoparticles that are heated by short laser pulses to create highly localized cell damage. The method is closely related to chromophore-assisted laser inactivation and photodynamic therapy, but is driven solely by light absorption, without the need for photochemical intermediates (particularly singlet oxygen). The mechanism of light-particle interaction was investigated by nanosecond time-resolved microscopy and by thermal modeling. The extent of light-induced damage was investigated by cell lethality, by cell membrane permeability, and by protein inactivation. Strong particle size dependence was found for these interactions. A technique based on light to target endogenous particles is already being exploited to treat pigmented cells in dermatology and ophthalmology. With exogenous particles, phamacokinetics and biodistribution studies are needed before the method can be evaluated against photodynamic therapy for cancer treatment. However, particles are unique, unlike photosensitizers, in that they can remain stable and <b>inert</b> in <b>cells</b> for extended periods. Thus they may be particularly useful for prelabeling cells in engineered tissue before implantation. Subsequent irradiation with laser pulses will allow control of the implanted cells (inactivation or modulation) in a noninvasive manner. ...|$|R
40|$|Drops of {{coal tar}} {{introduced}} into the subcutaneous tissue attract the fibroblasts, endothelial and other cells to them. These cells suffer degenerative changes through this action of the tar and the animal suffers cachectic-like changes and death from large doses of it {{introduced into the}} subcutaneous tissue. This action of the coal tar {{is limited to a}} short period of time, after which it becomes <b>inert.</b> The <b>cells</b> which have been drawn to it and which have not completely degenerated then slowly recover. Where large numbers of these cells are drawn to the tar they grow and divide after recovering from the initial effects of the tar. Cancer may develop. Where only a few cells are drawn to the tar they lay down intercellular fibrils and a scar eventually develops. Vitamin A fed in more than ample quantities to these animals protects the animals and the cells against the toxic action of the tar and stimulates and prolongs their secondary growth. Vitamin B stimulates the secondary growth of these cells. This action is limited in extent and time. It is followed by an early degeneration and hyalinization of the tissue...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{epithelial}} cells and fibroblasts fail to move over one another's upper surfaces in culture, resulting in monolayering. The failure of seeded fibroblasts {{to adhere to}} and spread on epithelial cell surfaces suggests that monolayering in culture {{is due to the}} lack of adhesion of the upper cell surface, at least of epithelial cells. Seeded fibroblasts and postmitotic, rounded fibroblasts likewise fail to spread on the upper surfaces of spread fibroblasts, suggesting that the inability of the upper cell surface to support spreading may be a general phenomenon. <b>Inert</b> particles and <b>cell</b> processes do not adhere directly to the upper cell surface. However, they can initiate adhesions to the surface at a cell's free margin, suggesting a variation of adhesive properties over a cell's surface...|$|R
