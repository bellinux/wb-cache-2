'When I decided to write this book, I didn't even think about {{involving}} Ken, from ancient times, to come in and help.'" [...] Carter's biographer Douglas Brinkley has observed that Stein and Carter have a [...] "passionate, up-and-down relationship" [...] and that Stein has criticized some of Carter's previous statements about Israel. In response to Professor Stein's current criticism of the book, representatives of its publisher, Simon & Schuster, state: [...] "We haven't seen these allegations, we haven't seen any specifics, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of assessing anything he [...] has said. ... This is all about nothing. We stand behind the book fully, and the fact that there has been a divided reaction to it is not surprising." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 {{evidence}} came {{to light}} that Arthur and Donna Kinlaw were responsible for Princess Doe's murder. Donna was arrested in California for attempting to commit welfare fraud by using the name [...] "Elaina", which was traced to a Long Island native involved in Arthur's prostitution ring; Donna gave details about two murders Arthur had committed, of two other females who remain unidentified today. After Kinlaw {{was faced with a}} death sentence, Donna told authorities that Kinlaw had killed another woman, a prostitute, earlier in 1982. She told police that she was with Arthur in the cemetery and witnessed him commit the murder. Another report states that Donna Kinlaw said that in July 1982, her husband brought home a teenage girl, left home and returned without her. He later apparently disposed of his clothing and cleaned his vehicle. Afterward, he threatened his wife, claiming if she did not attend her job, he would [...] "take her life" [...] as he did to the girl he brought home. However, a lack of corroboration meant that Kinlaw was not charged. Speirs stated, [...] " [...] claimed responsibility for her death. But I have no physical evidence to confirm that, and without the identity of Princess Doe, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of connecting the dots so to speak, putting her in a place where he could have been or would have been at the same time." [...] Spears also reported that he doubted the confession because the Kinlaws could not provide a name for Princess Doe, even though they had claimed to have been with her for a period of time. Despite that he questions the credibility of their statements, Spears does believe the victim was native to Long Island, New York. However, Donna Kinlaw was interviewed by a forensic artist who created a sketch of the girl she claimed to have met, which does resemble the most recent composite. Arthur remains incarcerated for two counts of second-degree murder.|$|E

Matheny, charging such a bargain between Trumbull and myself. My own opinion is that Matheny did do some such immoral thing as to tell a story that he knew nothing about. I believe he did. I contradicted it instantly, and it has been contradicted by Judge Trumbull, while nobody has produced any proof, because there is none. Now, whether the speech which the Judge brings forward here is really the one Matheny made, I do not know, and I hope the Judge will pardon me for doubting the genuineness of this document, since his production of those Springfield resolutions at Ottawa. I do not wish to dwell at any great length upon this matter. I can say nothing when a long story like this is told, except it is not true, and demand that he who insists upon it shall produce some proof.
