5|$|Due to {{the project}} being split into two phases, it was decided for {{efficiency}} to design each phase as mirror image halves of one complete station with only the handful of items the whole site would share (like the <b>flue</b> <b>stack</b> and coal handling area) and so needed to be build in First Half, being the difference. This extended to seeking the same contractors and suppliers as worked on First Half for Completion. Unfortunately due to the decade timespan between comparable works on the 2 phases several manufacturers that had supplied First Half had merged or ceased trading, combined with changes in legislation, this meant numerous components and equipment ranges used for First Half were either no longer available for Completion or had significantly changed. Separately, operating experience over that timespan had led to design improvement in equipment and plant specified by the Board, leading to a few significant areas of the design of Completion being altered.|$|E

In many, if not most situations, the resistance is primarily imposed by the <b>flue</b> <b>stack</b> itself. In these cases, the resistance is proportional to the stack height H.

40|$|The {{development}} of tunable diode laser absorption sensors for measurements in industrial boilers, both through direct absorption and evanescent wave absorption {{have been performed}} in the work presented here. These sensors use both direct and indirect absorption {{through the use of}} evanescent interactions within a coal firing combustion environment. For the direct absorption sensor, wavelength modulation absorption spectroscopy with second-harmonic detection was implemented within a physical probe designed to be placed with the <b>flue</b> <b>stack</b> of a power plant. Measurements were taken of carbon dioxide and water vapor concentration during operation at a local industrial facility. The design of this sensor probe overcomes problems of beam steering and permits a reference gas measurement. Extracted concentration data and design elements from the direct absorption measurements are presented. In addition, {{development of}} a sapphire fiber-based sensor using evanescent wave absorption along the outside of the fiber is presented. Evanescent absorption allows for the laser transmission to be maintained in the fiber at all times and may alleviate problems of background emission, beam steering, and especially scattering of the laser beam from solid particles experienced through free path direct absorption measurements in particulated flows. Laboratory measurements using evanescent fiber detection are presented...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} an experimental study on cotton stalk (CS) combustion in a circulating fluidized bed. The mixing and fluidizing characteristics of binary mixture of CS with 10 - 100 Â mm in length and alumina bed material with a certain size distribution in a cold test facility were studied. The results show that CS by itself cannot fluidize, and adding inert bed material can improve the fluidization condition. CS can mix well with alumina at fluidization number NÂ =Â  3 - 7. As N is more than 7, there will exist a little more segregation. The study concerning combustion characteristics of pure CS was performed on a circulating fluidized bed with a heat input of 0. 5 Â MW. The effects of fluidizing velocity, secondary air flow and gas flow to the loop seal on the bed temperature profiles were investigated. Although there is a little more segregation at N higher than 7 in the cold tests, the hot experimental results indicate that slight segregation has little effect on the steady combustion of the dense region. In this study, the concentrations of major gaseous pollutants (CO, SO 2 and NO) in <b>flue</b> (<b>stack)</b> gas were measured.

40|$|A {{radiological}} {{assessment was}} carried out on the release of positron-emitting radioactive gases from a roof-level stack at a central London site. Different modelling approaches were performed to investigate the range of radiation doses to representative persons. Contributions from plume inhalation, gamma shine and immersion to effective dose were taken into account. Dry and wet surface deposition on the roof, and exposure from contamination on the skin of roof-workers, added only a mean 4. 7 % to effective dose and were neglected. A 1 : 200 scale model, consisting of the stack and surrounding buildings, was tested in a wind tunnel to simulate pollutant dispersion in the near-field region i. e. rooftop. Concentration field measurements in the wind tunnel were converted into effective dose, including for roof-workers installing glass cladding to the stack building. Changes in the building shape, from addition of the cladding layer, were investigated {{in terms of the}} near-field flow pattern and significant differences found between the two cases. Pollutant concentrations were also modelled using Air Dispersion Modelling System (ADMS) and the results used to calculate the effective dose using the same meteorological data set and source release terms. Sector averaged wind tunnel dose estimates were greater than the ADMS figure by approximately a factor of two to three. Different stack release heights were investigated in the wind tunnel and ADMS simulations {{in order to determine the}} best height for the replacement <b>flue</b> <b>stack</b> for the building. Other techniques were investigated: building wake models, modified Gaussian plume methods and uniform dilution into a hemispherical volume to show the wide variation in predicted dose possible with different approaches.

40|$|A {{pyrolysis}} reactor {{was built}} in a previous project by Bridges et al (2013). The reactor is cylindrical in geometry, with a height of 1000 mm and an internal diameter of 750 mm, it stands vertically. There is a 900 mm tall and 100 mm in diameter perforated core {{in the center of}} the reactor. At the base, a combustion chamber provides the hot gases required for heating. The hot gases produced travel up and around the reactor through an annulus region of 11 mm. Heat from the gases is transferred to the reactor wall and then to the wood-chips inside. As drying and pyrolysis reactions occur, gases flow in the same direction as the heat towards the perforated core at the center. Hot pyrolysis gases then flow downwards towards the combustion chamber where they are partially combusted before flowing around the reactor and out the <b>flue</b> <b>stack.</b> This project aimed at mathematically modeling this reactor and also improving the way emissions are released so that it complies with EPA air quality standards. A mathematical model of an ‘open source’ pilot-scale pyrolysis reactor was produced to predict the product yield, carbon foot-print, biochar quality and the time taken to achieve complete pyrolysis. A non-equilibrium thermodynamic approach was used which allowed for the use of COMSOL Multi-Physics to solve the model. The Finite Element Method (FEM) was used to solve the system of equations. Pyrolysis kinetics are complex and no single model has yet been widely accepted, therefore simplifications were necessary in this model so that a reasonable solution time could be achieved while producing acceptable results. The model profile of the centre temperature closely followed that of the experimental results and thus the model was considered valid. In addition, modifications were made to the original design of the pyrolyser in order to improve emissions compliance and improve operations of the pyrolysis. It was important to manage fugitive emissions and completely combust any volatile vapours that would be released into the atmosphere while controlling the operating parameters. In order to achieve this, the following were implemented: 1) The combustion chamber was sealed completely so that no fugitive emissions can escape while limiting the ingress of oxygen. 2) A secondary blower was installed in order to better control the oxygen supply to the burners. 3) The original steel lid, which warped during pyrolysis runs resulting in gaseous leaks, was replaced with a more rigid ceramic lid that doesn’t effectively expand when heated. 4) Two 3. 4 kW burners were added to the single 3. 4 kW burner flare. This gives a total power of 10. 2 kW, which is estimated to be enough to completely burn all gaseous products leaving the system" [...] Prefac...|$|E
40|$|The Sensor Research & Development Corporation (SRD) has {{undertaken}} {{the development of}} a Continuous Emissions Monitor (CEM) for mercury based on the technique of Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRD). The project involved building an instrument for the detection of trace levels of mercury in the flue gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. The project has occurred over two phases. The first phase concentrated {{on the development of the}} ringdown cavity and the actual detection of mercury. The second phase dealt with the construction and integration of the sampling system, used to carry the sample from the <b>flue</b> <b>stack</b> to the CRD cavity, into the overall CRD instrument. The project incorporated a Pulsed Alexandrite Laser (PAL) system from Light Age Incorporated as the source to produce the desired narrow band 254 nm ultra-violet (UV) radiation. This laser system was seeded with a diode laser to bring the linewidth of the output beam from about 150 GHz to less than 60 MHz for the fundamental beam. Through a variety of non-linear optics the 761 nm fundamental beam is converted into the 254 nm beam needed for mercury detection. Detection of the mercury transition was verified by the identification of the characteristic natural isotopic structure observed at lower cavity pressures. The five characteristic peaks, due to both natural isotopic abundance and hyperfine splitting, provided a unique identifier for mercury. SRD scientists were able to detect mercury in air down below 10 parts-per-trillion by volume (pptr). This value is dependent on the pressure and temperature within the CRD cavity at the time of detection. Sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2 }) absorbs UV radiation in the same spectral region as mercury, which is a significant problem for most mercury detection equipment. However, SRD has not only been able to determine accurate mercury concentrations in the presence of SO{sub 2 }, but the CRD instrument can in fact determine the SO{sub 2 } concentration as well. Detection of mercury down to the low hundreds of pptr has been accomplished in the presence of SO{sub 2 } at concentration levels much higher than that found in typical flue gas emissions. SRD scientists extended the interferent testing to each individual component found in flue gas. It was found that only SO{sub 2 } had a significant effect on the ring-down decay curve. Upon completion of testing the components of flue gas individually a simulated flue gas stream was used to test to the CRD instrument. The result showed accurate detection of mercury down to levels below 100 pptr in a simulated flue gas stream with the concentrations of the various components above that found in a typical untreated flue gas. A sampling system was designed and integrated into the CRD instrument to carry the sample from the flue gas stack to the CRD cavity. The sampling system was constructed so that it could be placed very close to the sampling port. SRD scientists were able to couple the UV laser light into an optical fiber, which is then sent to the sampling system. This allows the laser system to be isolated from the sampling system. Initial long-term testing revealed a couple of problems related to the stability of the output frequency of the laser system. These problems have been successfully dealt with by incorporating specific software solutions into the overall data acquisition program. The project culminated in a field test conducted at the DOE/NETL pilot plant facility in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The object of the test was the evaluation of a cavity ringdown spectrometer constructed for the detection of TOTAL vapor phase mercury as a continuous emission monitor (CEM). Although there is the potential for the instrument to determine the amount of speciation between neutral elemental mercury (Hg{sup (o) }) and oxidized mercury (Hg{sup (+ 2) }), the initial test plan was to concentrate on the measurement of the total mercury. Another added benefit is that the measurements will report the sulfur dioxide (SO 2) concentration throughout the test. This report concludes the technical work associated with Phases I & II and the field test for the Cavity Ring-Down mercury detection project...|$|E
