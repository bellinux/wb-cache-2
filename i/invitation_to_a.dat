5|$|Blaine and Harrison {{wished to}} see American power and trade {{expanded}} across the Pacific and were {{especially interested in}} securing rights to harbors in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Pago Pago, Samoa. When Blaine entered office, the United States, Great Britain, and the German Empire were disputing their respective rights in Samoa. Thomas F. Bayard, Blaine’s predecessor, had accepted an <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> three-party conference in Berlin aimed at resolving the dispute, and Blaine appointed American representatives to attend. The result was a treaty that created a condominium among the three powers, allowing all of them access to the harbor.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} when Taft met Helen Herron (often called Nellie), {{but it was no}} later than 1880, when she {{mentioned}} in her diary receiving an <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> party from him. By 1884, they were meeting regularly, and in 1885, after an initial rejection, she agreed to marry him. The wedding took place at the Herron home on June 19, 1886. William Taft remained devoted to his wife throughout their almost 44 years of marriage. Nellie Taft pushed her husband much as his parents had, and she could be very frank with her criticisms. The couple had three children, of which the eldest, Robert, became a U.S. senator.|$|E
5|$|Josephson's {{reputation}} for promoting unorthodox causes was cemented by {{his support for}} the ideas of water memory and cold fusion, both of which are rejected by mainstream scientists. Water memory is purported to provide an explanation for homeopathy; it is mostly dismissed by scientists as pseudoscience, although Josephson has expressed support for it since attending a conference at which French immunologist Jacques Benveniste first proposed it. Cold fusion is the hypothesis that nuclear reactions can occur at room temperature. When Martin Fleischmann, the British chemist who pioneered research into it, died in 2012, Josephson wrote a supportive obituary in the Guardian and complained to Nature that its obituary had failed to give Fleischmann due credit. Antony Valentini of Imperial College London withdrew Josephson's <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 2010 conference on the de Broglie-Bohm theory because of his work on the paranormal, although it was reinstated after complaints.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles {{toured the}} Philippines in July 1966, playing two {{shows at the}} Rizal Memorial Football Stadium in Manila. Epstein unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady Imelda Marcos when {{presented}} with an <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> breakfast party. He had politely declined {{on behalf of the}} group, as it was their policy never to accept such official invitations. The Beatles and their entourage were ejected from their hotel on the same day and given a police escort to the airport, even though Epstein had publicly apologised for the misunderstanding in a televised statement, which was not seen or heard because of static. The entourage boarded the plane for home, but Epstein and Beatles' assistant Mal Evans were ordered off, both believing {{that they would not be}} allowed back on the plane. Epstein was forced to give the tax authorities £6,800 worth of Philippine peso notes earned from the Manila shows and to sign a tax bond verifying the exchange before being allowed back on the plane with Evans.|$|E

Ben then immediately kisses her, leaving Leslie simultaneously delighted and nervous about their future.|$|E

25|$|Statius' {{first three}} {{books of the}} Silvae seem to have {{received}} some criticism, and in response he composed a fourth book' at Naples, {{which was published in}} 95. During this period at Naples, Statius maintained his relations with the court and his patrons, earning himself another <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> palace banquet (Silv. 4.2). He seems to have taken an interest in the marriage and career of his stepdaughter and he also took a young slave boy under his wing, as he was childless, who died c. 95. In that same year Statius embarked on a new epic, the Achilleid, giving popular recitations of his work (Juv. 7.83) only to complete a book and a half before dying in 95, leaving the poem unfinished. His fifth book of Silvae were published after his death c. 96.|$|E
25|$|Britain {{elevated}} {{tensions in}} 1755 by offering to finance Russian military deployments {{in return for}} a Russian army standing ready to attack Prussia's eastern frontier. Alarmed by this encirclement, Frederick began working to separate Britain from the coalition. On 16 January 1756, Prussia and Britain agreed to the Convention of Westminster, under which Prussia now undertook to guarantee Hanover against French attack, in return for Britain's withdrawal of its offer of military subsidies to Russia. This move created a new Anglo-Prussian alliance and incensed the French court, which responded to Prussia's realignment with Britain by accepting Maria Theresa's <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new Franco-Austrian alliance, formalized with the First Treaty of Versailles in May 1756, and to be consolidated by a dynastic alliance with marriage of the Dauphin to one of Maria Theresa's daughters.

25|$|Phinehas is said {{never to}} have {{accepted}} an <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> meal and, after he had attained his majority, to have refused to eat at the table of his father.

Judah I once invited him to a meal, and exceptionally he decided to accept the invitation; but on arriving at the house of the patriarch he noticed in the yard mules of a certain kind the use of which was forbidden by local custom on account of the danger in handling them. Thereupon he retraced his steps and did not return (Hul. l.c.).|$|E
