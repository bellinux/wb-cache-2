6000|$|The trouble {{heretofore}} has been--I am quoting {{remarks of}} planters and steamboatmen--that the planters, although owning the land, were without cash capital; had to <b>hypothecate</b> both land and crop {{to carry on}} the business. Consequently, the commission dealer who furnishes the money takes some risk and demands big interest--usually 10 per cent., and 2{half} per cent. for negotiating the loan. The planter has also to buy his supplies through the same dealer, paying commissions and profits. Then when he ships his crop, the dealer adds his commissions, insurance, etc. So, taking it by and large, and first and last, the dealer's share of that crop is about 25 per cent.'{footnote ['But what can the State do where the people are under subjection to rates of interest ranging from 18 to 30 per cent., and are also under the necessity of purchasing their crops in advance even of planting, at these rates, for the privilege of purchasing all their supplies at 100 per cent. profit?'--EDWARD ATKINSON.]} ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{history of}} <b>hypothecated</b> taxes goes way back. One {{of the first}} {{examples}} of earmarking was ‘Ship Money’ or in other words the tax paid by English seaports used to finance the Royal Navy. Later, in the 20th century, the <b>hypothecated</b> tax became to be discussed among the politicians in the United Kingdom. For example, the Vehicle Excise Duty from 1920 when earned revenues {{were used for the}} construction and maintenance of the roads, [...] assigning 1p on the income tax directly to education in 1992 or giving £300 million per year from the revenues from taxes on the tobacco industry to help the fight against smoking-related diseases since 1999. Nowadays, earmarking of taxes is mainly connected to the health care system, education or the upkeep of the roads.==Types of <b>hypothecated</b> tax== The <b>hypothecated</b> tax can be divided into three groups based on the main characteristics. The emphasis can be put on the final use of the revenues, on the vastness of the area financed from the money earned or on the type of the tax. Each group then has two subsections. In the first case, we distinguish between strong and weak hypothecation. Strong hypothecation means that the revenues from the tax go only to financing the particular service and the service is financed only through the revenues from this tax. Strong hypothecation is thought to be appropriate for pure public goods where voters must reveal their consumption preferences. If {{at least one of the}} two conditions is not met, we say that the hypothecation is weak. [...] This distinction is the most common as many of the arguments for and against <b>hypothecated</b> tax are based on it.|$|R

50|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{hypothecation}} is to mitigate the creditor's credit risk. If the debtor cannot pay, the creditor possesses the collateral and therefore can claim its ownership, sell it and thus compensate the lacking cash inflows. In a default of the obligor without previous hypothecation, the creditor cannot be sure that it can seize sufficient assets of the debtor. Because hypothecation {{makes it easier to}} get the debt and potentially decreases its price; the debtor wants to <b>hypothecate</b> as much debt as possible - but the isolation of 'good assets' for the collateral worsens the quality {{of the rest of the}} debtor's balance sheet and thus its credit quality.|$|E

[...] Adams also found the book [...] "littered with errors... that smack of economic illiteracy and careless research." [...] Of her style, he observed: [...] "Readers may also be unimpressed with Hertz's informal prose style and strangled syntax... The first chapter, especially, reads like a rejected screenplay for an unhappy episode of The West Wing." [...] Adams concluded his review by writing: [...] "While no one can doubt Hertz's good intentions, the road to hell is paved with books like IOU. Developing-world debt is a serious issue, and it deserves more judicious treatment than this." ...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{noticeable}} progress Argentina {{continues to}} be plagued by a culture of machismo. Though not as openly aggressive or hyper-sexual as historically, men continue to impose a significant degree of superiority over women. Violence is commonplace within Argentine society, with violence against women socialised into the population and continuing at disturbingly high levels. At present a woman is murdered by her partner every thirty hours in Argentina (Casa de Encuentro, 2015 b). Women face discrimination throughout all walks of their everyday life, no matter their wealth, class or social status. Through primary research conducted in Buenos Aires, Argentina {{during the summer of}} 2015 this dissertation uses online surveys, interviews with women’s organisations and participant observation to <b>hypothecate</b> a cyclical model of machismo and violence. This model illustrates how machismo’s normalisation of violence places an enormous strain upon women’s organisations, and non-governmental organisations in particular. Ultimately, the Argentine State has failed in its responsibility as a duty bearer to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of all its population. Society’s frustration at this is becoming increasingly evident, culminating in the Ni Una Menos march in June 2015 which saw thousands take to streets across the country demanding an end to femicides. Yet, still it seems that {{it is only in the}} case of death that people are taking action. This dissertation proposes ways to change this and offers a more effective, sustainable path for the future to move forward to a society free from violence and gender discrimination, beginning with education...|$|E

50|$|Councils are {{expected}} {{by the government}} to be largely self-financing. The government has steadily removed <b>hypothecated</b> funding for child social care, and for safeguarding children from abuse or neglect. Historically, councils had to send Business Rate revenue to the government, while the government provided a large grant to councils based on need. Under the Cameron Ministry, the Business rate system was changed, so that councils keep 50% of the revenue; the central government grant was correspondingly reduced, and <b>hypothecated</b> streams merged into the general grant. The central grant has continued to fall, and shortly councils will retain 100% of Business Rate revenue. The grant has also fallen due to school funding being transferred directly to new Academy schools, and Housing Benefit (paid via the council) being replaced by centrally paid Universal Credit.|$|R
40|$|Two <b>hypothecated</b> {{charges to}} fund local public {{transport}} have recently passed onto the statute books in the UK. The first is road user charging, with the London and Durham {{the first to be}} implemented and the second is a workplace parking levy. The use of such local <b>hypothecated</b> (or ‘earmarked’) mechanisms is not new. Indeed a variety of such charges, local taxes and levies have been in use for decades to fund public transport and (less frequently) as a tool for transport demand management in the USA, Germany, Austria, Portugal, Scandinavia, India and Singapore. In the general debate around the two new <b>hypothecated</b> charges in the UK, this international experience has been largely neglected. The aim {{of this paper is to}} detail a related and equally neglected area namely the local hypothecation of charges to fund public transport improvements within Britain. Under existing legislation it has been possible for some local authorities to dedicate revenue streams from sources such as parking charges and planning gain to develop and improve public transport services. There is also significant experience of dedicated revenue streams in the private sector, for example at airports. The paper details examples of the British experience of hypothecation and will consider their lessons for the new and more radical measures that are now being considered...|$|R
