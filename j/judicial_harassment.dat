50|$|These activities, {{including}} fact-finding {{and trial}} observation missions, research, advocacy and litigation, are implemented by independent human rights experts from all regions. Between 2009 and 2012, 576 defenders {{of human rights}} were released and the <b>judicial</b> <b>harassment</b> of 116 defenders ended.|$|E
50|$|His {{position}} as a deputy gave him immunity, but the federal Attorney General's Office pressured legislators for his impeachment. One {{of the reasons the}} immunity exists is to shield sitting legislators from <b>judicial</b> <b>harassment</b> by opposition parties. It can be taken away only with a majority vote by legislators - the situation in which Godoy found himself.|$|E
50|$|Land rights {{violations}} remain {{one of the}} most prominent and prevalent form of human {{rights violations}} in Cambodia. Despite protection of land rights under domestic and international law, large swathes of the country have been leased for commercial exploitation through notorious and opaque economic land concessions. Insecurity of land tenure (due to a widespread lack of formal land titles), almost complete impunity for abusers of land rights, and weak law enforcement have all further contributed to forced land evictions, illegal land grabs and land disputes. The weak, marginalized and vulnerable very seldom come out on top. Often, individuals challenging land claims by powerful business interests are met with <b>harassment,</b> <b>judicial</b> and physical attacks, with perpetrators of land rights and other human rights abuses rarely held to account. CCHR supports land rights activists who are suffering from human rights violations, including through its HRD protection mechanism and fund.|$|R
5000|$|The quality, {{thoroughness}} {{and courage}} of Michas's reporting {{of the military}} support that Greek [...] "volunteers" [...] gave the Bosnian Serb side during the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and the reluctance of successive Greek governments to investigate the issue was highlighted in Reporters Sans Frontieres's criticism of what the organisation described as a [...] "surreal" [...] action and a clear case of <b>judicial</b> <b>harassment.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 2000, {{journalists were}} {{assaulted}} and threatened by {{police officers in}} Tunis. Among them was Omar Mestiri (an editor of the opposition online newspaper Kalima, who {{is a victim of}} <b>judicial</b> <b>harassment.</b> Reporters Without Borders [...] ) and Mohammed Bechri, both human rights activists, Bechri told Human Rights Watch that he was forcibly prevented from approaching the Ministry and was attacked in his car as he was trying to leave.|$|E
50|$|<b>Judicial</b> <b>harassment</b> of the blogger and {{politician}} Aleksey Navalny {{continued in}} 2014. Navalny was fined $8,400 in April for defaming a Moscow city councillor on Twitter. In December {{he was sentenced}} to {{three and a half years}} (with suspended sentence) together with his brother Oleg Navalny upon fraud charges. Roskomnadzor warned four media that reported on the sentence and relied a video of Navalny calling for demonstration, accusing them of inciting extremism.|$|E
5000|$|The arrest led Amnesty International to {{name him}} a {{prisoner}} of conscience, [...] "imprisoned solely for the peaceful expression of his beliefs". The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information also condemned the arrest, describing {{it as part of}} [...] "the severe decline of freedom of opinion and expression and freedom of the press" [...] in Sudan. The Doha Centre for Media Freedom criticized Saleh's interrogations and detention, calling them [...] "harassment" [...] designed [...] "to prevent Saleh from doing his work as a journalist". The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists also called on Sudanese authorities to [...] "release Saleh immediately and stop harassing him." [...] Reporters Without Borders described itself as [...] "outraged at the violence and pressure" [...] against Saleh, describing it as [...] "further proof of the repressive attitude towards the press {{on the part of the}} Khartoum government, whose intention is to silence all dissident voices". Front Line Defenders called for the charges against Saleh to be dropped, and stated that they appeared to be [...] "part of an ongoing campaign of <b>judicial</b> <b>harassment</b> and intimidation against the human rights defender". The International Federation of Human Rights called [...] "on the Sudanese authorities to put an end to the <b>judicial</b> <b>harassment</b> faced by Mr. Salih", and launched a letter-writing campaign on his behalf.|$|E
5000|$|Describing {{himself as}} [...] "President of the Suspended Republic", Tsiranana did not retire from {{political}} life {{and became a}} virulent opponent of the military regime. General Ramanantsoa informed {{him that he was}} not to talk about political decisions and that he was no longer authorised to make declarations to journalists. The PSD experienced <b>judicial</b> <b>harassment</b> with the arrest of many prominent party members. During the consultative elections of the National Popular Development Council (CNPD) on 21 October 1973, the PSD was the victim of electoral irregularities. Candidates supporting the military regime won 130 of the 144 seats up for election.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{restoration}} of civilian government and the Awami League victory in 2008, Rahman has been a strong critic of the government through his newspaper. Party and government officials have reacted by charging him with defamation and sedition cases more than 50 times since 2009 to 2013. He {{is the only person}} to be sentenced for contempt by the Bangladesh Supreme Court. International human rights groups and press organisations have characterised the government's actions against him as <b>judicial</b> <b>harassment.</b> Critics have said he has misrepresented bloggers and activists associated with the 2013 Shahbag protests and contributed to widespread religious tensions and civil unrest.|$|E
5000|$|In early 2013 Hall was sued by Natural Fruit Company {{following}} {{the publication of}} the Finnwatch report [...] "Cheap Has a High Price". Hall claimed to have interviewed workers for the report, some of whom were undocumented migrants and reported poor working conditions, unlawfully low wages, confiscation of official documents, use of child labour and excessive overtime. Altogether Natural Fruit has brought four cases against Hall, for alleged defamation and computer crimes. Several human rights organisations and trade unions have condemned Natural Fruit's actions as <b>judicial</b> <b>harassment</b> and an attempt to silence a human rights defender, and called for the cases to be dropped.|$|E
5000|$|Amnesty International {{called the}} charges [...] "fabricated", {{designated}} her and fellow convicted activist Tim Sakmony as prisoners of conscience, {{and stated that}} the two were [...] "being persecuted purely for their work defending the rights of those in their communities {{who have lost their}} houses through forced evictions". The World Organisation Against Torture and the International Federation for Human Rights released a joint statement calling for the pair's [...] "immediate and unconditional release and the lift of pending charges, as their detention and <b>judicial</b> <b>harassment</b> seem to merely aim at obstructing their human rights activities and appear to be a result of them exercising their right to freedoms of expression and association".|$|E
5000|$|The campaigning {{organisation}} Reporters Sans Frontieres {{urged the}} Greek court {{to dismiss the}} action, which it described as [...] "surreal" [...] and a clear case of <b>judicial</b> <b>harassment.</b> Referring to the quality, thoroughness and courage of Michas's reporting of the Greek [...] "volunteers"'military support to the Bosnian Serbs and successive Greek governments' reluctance to investigate the issue the organisation found the [...] "self-censorship" [...] of the Greek political class and media {{about the presence of}} any paramilitaries or mercenaries forces from the country in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Srebrenica massacre [...] "surprising and disturbing" [...] and in the public interest called for further close examination {{of the role of the}} Greek authorities.|$|E
5000|$|On January 2, 2014, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) {{expressed}} concern over “the <b>judicial</b> <b>harassment</b> of journalists {{critical of the}} authorities in {{the southern city of}} Rostov-on-Don,” citing the cases of Tolmachev, who had been in pre-trial detention for two years, and of another journalist, Sergei Reznik, who had just been sentenced to a penal colony. “It is hard to interpret the repeated extensions of Tolmachev’s pre-trial detention as anything other than a repressive measure,” commented RSF, “especially as the investigation ended months ago and he has serious health problems. Why cannot he be granted a conditional release that would allow him to seek appropriate medical care while complying with court summonses?” RSF also protested “the fact that individuals who had been criticized in Tolmachev’s articles are now in charge of his case.” ...|$|E
50|$|She {{has been}} {{detained}} since December 20, 2016 {{in the aftermath}} of the failed coup in Turkey in the summer of the same year. Following her detention she was formally arrested on suspicion of “being a member of an armed terror organisation” on the basis of alleged testimonies from a secret witness and an intelligence report. She has since been detained at Şakran prison, İzmir Province. Her arbitrary detention and <b>judicial</b> <b>harassment</b> are part of the FETÖ/PDY (Fethullahist Terror Organisation/ Parallel State Structure) Investigation launched in 2015 by İzmir Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office and Organised Crime Bureau Prosecutor’s Office into Gediz University, targeting several academics, following July’s failed coup. The investigation is based on allegations that these academics are either members, or connected to terrorist organisations. Several human rights' organizations have been asking for action to be taken.|$|E
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2012, the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development and its Mongolian member organization, the Centre for Human Rights and Development, {{investigated}} “the situation of human rights defenders...working on human rights violations in relation to mining activities in Mongolia.” The investigators found that herders living near mines “face numerous human rights violations, including the rights {{to live in a}} safe and secure environment; to access clean water; to choose and protect the source of their livelihood and income; to own property; to participate in decision-making concerning the mineral exploitation on their lands; to access justice and effective remedies; and to preserve their cultural heritage.” The investigators found that human rights defenders were subjected to threats, intimidation, <b>judicial</b> <b>harassment,</b> vilification, and smear campaigns; in their report the investigators noted that even they, though accompanied by local officials, “were harassed by a security guard” at mining site.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, {{an appeals}} court affirmed the {{conviction}} of 29 human-rights activists on such charges as insulting the sultan and of unlawful assembly, and {{all but one of}} them began serving prison sentences. Amnesty International stated its belief “that many, if not all, of those imprisoned are held solely for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression or assembly and are therefore prisoners of conscience,” and called on Oman to immediately release all of those being “held simply for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression or assembly.” In September 2012, Freedom House criticized the “escalating efforts by the government to tighten its control online and offline following Arab Spring-inspired unrest,” [...] and Front Line Defenders condemned “the ongoing <b>judicial</b> <b>harassment</b> of...human rights defenders and peaceful protesters” and expressed its view that this harassment “is directly related to their legitimate activities in the defense of human rights.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{constitution}} and law provide {{for freedom of}} speech and press; however, the government restricted these rights. According to the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, [...] "the environment for independent and opposition media remained hostile, with numerous obstacles to freedom of expression, including administrative hurdles, arbitrary arrest and detention, intimidation and <b>judicial</b> <b>harassment</b> against journalists, and the closure of media outlets, leading to self-censorship." [...] Individuals who publicly or privately criticized the government or the president risked government reprisal. In March 2011 President Jammeh warned independent journalists that he would “not compromise or sacrifice the peace, security, stability, dignity, and the well being of Gambians for the sake of freedom of expression.” Accusing some journalists of being the “mouthpiece of opposition parties,” he vowed to prosecute any journalist who offended him. The National Intelligence Agency (NIA) was involved in arbitrary closure of media outlets and the extrajudicial detention of journalists.|$|E
