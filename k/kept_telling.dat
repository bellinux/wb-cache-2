There were points I thought, 'You know what, I don't {{know if this is}} going to happen'. But with the help from my friends and my family, they all <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> me to believe in myself and keep on doing it and I did and now I'm here and thank you so much to them.|$|E

Wallowing in her {{identity}} dilemmas, she decided to end her life, since the pastors in her church and the people around her <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> her there was something abnormal about her feminine characteristic. She claimed to have attempted suicide twice and survived. The Suicide attempts made her stronger to either leave Nigeria to a more tolerant society or to succeed in killing herself in the third suicide attempt.|$|E
25|$|Priscilla {{was always}} keen {{to go to}} Hollywood with Elvis, but he <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> {{her that he was}} too busy for that and she was made to stay in Memphis. During the filming of Viva Las Vegas, Elvis began an affair with his co-star Ann-Margret. When Priscilla read of these reports in the press, she confronted Elvis. He told her that they were simply rumors to promote the film and that she should not believe {{everything}} that she read in the press. For the next few years, Elvis would have intimate relationships with many of his leading ladies and co-stars, all the while denying their existence to Priscilla. Eventually she was allowed to visit him in Hollywood, but her visits were kept short.|$|E

500|$|Christopher Cooper, head of Cavity Search Records (which {{released}} Roman Candle), {{said about}} this time in Smith's life, [...] "I talked him out of thinking {{that he wanted to}} kill himself numerous times when he was in Portland. I <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> him that he was a brilliant man, and that life was worth living, and that people loved him." [...] Pete Krebs also agreed: [...] "In Portland we got the brunt of Elliott's initial depression... Lots of people have stories of their own experiences of staying up with Elliott 'til five in the morning, holding his hand, telling him not to kill himself." ...|$|E
500|$|Near {{the end of}} the project, Moore {{realized}} that the story bore some similarity to [...] "The Architects of Fear", an episode of The Outer Limits television series. The writer and Wein argued over changing the ending, and when Moore refused to give in, Wein quit the book. Wein explained, [...] "I <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> him, 'Be more original, Alan, you've got the capability, do something different, not something that's already been done!' And he didn't seem to care enough to do that." [...] Moore acknowledged the Outer Limits episode by referencing it in the series' last issue.|$|E

His funeral was offered at Abu Bakar Siddiq mosque, DHA Phase-II, and he was buried at Gizri graveyard later that day.

In order to reduce the pressure, she <b>kept</b> on <b>telling</b> herself that, anyway, nobody knew her there and that, if she did not pass, everybody will have forgotten her a couple of days later.

500|$|The New York Yankees {{baseball}} team {{refused to give}} Homicide: Life on the Street {{permission to use the}} Yankees logo in the episode, which Fontana said angered the writers and inspired them to portray Yankees fans in a particularly negative light. Fontana, a New York native himself, was later apologetic about this portrayal and said, [...] "I <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> the guys they were being a little harsh on the Yankees". The names [...] "Stringfield" [...] and [...] "Doherty" [...] can be seen under Ballard's case list on the white board. The names were purposely inserted as an inside joke to Homicide fans as a reference to online rumors that cast member Melissa Leo was to be replaced by actors Shannon Doherty or Sherry Stringfield. The false rumors were actually leaked by Tom Fontana himself to keep fans guessing.|$|E
500|$|Kills {{revealed}} to Elle that the songwriting process for [...] "Saturday Night" [...] was difficult, {{as she had}} to confront memories and feelings. She further explained that, to her, {{it felt like a}} [...] "confession". This song was deemed by Kills as her life's soundtrack: [...] "When I was almost 14, I left home, got a job, and thought I {{was going to be a}} big TV star. I was determined to prove myself. I <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> myself, 'I'm going to be fine,' even when I wasn't—especially when I didn't even believe it. The song is about carrying on, even though you feel like you can't. It's about feeling OK when everything is not." [...] She later reiterated those sentiments with website Digital Spy, and stated that it would show people what she truly was and what she had gone through over the years.|$|E

Please sit down, keep remaining seating. We have a bomb on board. So sit." [...] The controller understood the transmission, but chose to respond, [...] "Calling Cleveland center, you're unreadable. Say again, slowly." [...] The cockpit recording captured Dahl moaning and Jarrah telling him in English {{to sit down and}} to stop touching something (presumably the controls); Jason Dahl's wife, Sandy Dahl, listening to the cockpit {{voice recorder}}, determined that Jarrah [...] "was fussing at my husband...he was speaking in English, and he spoke Arabic anytime he was talking with the other hijackers. Jason made moaning sounds after that. It sounded like he was trying to mess with stuff or get up, because the hijacker pilot <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> him to stop and to sit down." ...|$|E

Dismayed by the death of their leader, the remaining bandits ride away.|$|R
500|$|The direct {{impetus for}} the lyrics was an {{encounter}} with IRA supporters in New York City. As a promotional gimmick, U2 manager Paul McGuinness had made arrangements for the band {{to appear in the}} 1982 St. Patrick's Day parade. However, he later found that there was a possibility that Bobby Sands, an IRA hunger striker who had starved to death the previous year, would be the parade's honorary marshal. As they felt that the IRA's tactics were prolonging the fighting in Northern Ireland, McGuinness and the band members mutually decided they should withdraw from the parade. McGuinness met with one of the parade's organizers in a New York bar to arrange the cancellation, and ended up in a heated debate about the IRA. McGuinness recalled, [...] "He <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> me to keep my voice down. The place was full of New York policemen - Irish cops - and he thought I was going to get us killed." ...|$|E
500|$|Solti {{described}} {{his father as}} [...] "a kind, sweet man who trusted everyone. He shouldn't have, but he did. Jews in Hungary were tremendously patriotic. In 1914, when war broke out, my father invested most of his money in a war loan to help the country. By the time the bonds matured, they were worthless." [...] Mor Stern was a religious man, but his son was less so. Late in life Solti recalled, [...] "I often upset him because I never stayed in the synagogue for longer than ten minutes." [...] Teréz Stern was from a musical family, and encouraged her daughter Lilly, eight years the elder of the children, to sing, and György to accompany her at the piano. Solti remembered, [...] "I made so many mistakes, but it was invaluable experience for an opera conductor. I learnt to swim with her." [...] He was not a diligent student of the piano: [...] "My mother <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> me to practise, but what ten-year-old wants {{to play the piano}} when he could be out playing football?" ...|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for Commit This to Memory, which were booked by Hoppus, were scheduled over six weeks at Seedy Underbelly Studios in Valley Village, a district of Los Angeles, California, which {{was actually a}} rented house that had once belonged to Jeff Porcaro, the drummer for Toto. The band had, according to Hoppus, [...] "a million ideas {{and a lot of}} energy and enthusiasm to make a great record". Pierre strove for the record to have a sound that resembled the bands Braid, Superchunk, Jawbox and the Pixies. Living in a suburb, the neighbors had called police to the band and Hoppus several times for being too loud at night time, especially when Hoppus brought a Roland TR-808 drum machine outside to work on a song late at night. According to Pierre, Hoppus was not interested in putting his own stamp on the music, but rather bringing out the best in what he saw in the group. Hoppus generally modeled his production after Jerry Finn (a longtime producer of Blink-182), and therefore it involved much watching and listening. [...] "Mark <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> us, 'Your name {{is going to be a}} lot bigger on the front than mine is on the back'," [...] recalled Justin Pierre, [...] "So he would throw suggestions out there but always say, 'Feel free to turn these down.' And we would!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Egypt Independent {{reported}} that police forces dragged a protester, stripped him naked, {{beat him up}} with batons, {{and took him to}} a security truck. The incident sparked criticism against the administration of Morsi for tolerating the security force's excessive use of force. The presidency said it [...] "was pained by the shocking footage of some policemen treating a protester in a manner that does not accord with human dignity and human rights." [...] State television {{reported that}} the 48-year-old beaten man, from a police hospital and without a lawyer present, said that the police had in fact saved him from thieving protesters. The man's daughter, who says she was present {{at the scene of the}} attack, said that her father is simply [...] "afraid to talk", while his nephew said [...] "he is lying because there is a lot of pressure on him." [...] In new twist, Hamada Saber finally retracted his earlier testimony: [...] "I told [...] today that [...] shot me in the leg, beat me and dragged me," [...] he said. [...] "When I resisted, they tore off my shirt. After I resisted some more, they tore off my pants and underpants. They <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> me to stand up and I <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> them I was injured". [...] "Now my family has disowned me; my wife and kids won't talk to me.

[...] A classmate recalled her singing the refrain [...] "Can't help lovin' that man of mine" [...] from Show Boat with such feeling that she made their teacher uncomfortable.

5000|$|Originally from Okinawa, Japan, Caroline Lufkin {{graduated}} from the Berklee School of Music in Boston in 2003. After graduating, she moved to Tokyo and began working on an album. Before signing with her current label, she {{had been working on}} an album in the Japanese music industry where she was being groomed to be a Japanese pop singer. However, she left because of differening in views on her music stating that [...] "they <b>kept</b> on <b>telling</b> me to change things and I didn't want to change them... They were trying to make the music super-pop, and I couldn't quite deal with it." [...] She made ripples across the Japanese pop music scene when she famously walked away from a lucrative major label contract that virtually guaranteed the same kind of bright-light super-stardom that had made her sister Olivia a household name in Tokyo.|$|R

That kept me quite cool. Afterwards, I put the club carefully back in the case, pushed him a little under the sofa, and then I stopped to think for a moment. I was quite clever, Chetwode. The window was open through which the man had come, so I locked the door on the inside, stepped out of the window, came in at the front door with my latchkey, crept upstairs, undressed quickly and got into bed. The funny part of it all was, Chetwode," [...] he concluded, [...] "that nobody ever really found the body." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} Star Wars trilogy {{is considered}} one of the best film trilogies in history. Lucas has often stated that the entire trilogy was intended to be considered one film. However, he said that his story material for Star Wars was too long for a single film, prompting Lucas to split the story into multiple films. Lucas also stated that the story evolved over time and that [...] "There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now ... As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them ... I kept taking out all the good parts, and I just <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> myself I would make other movies someday." [...] In early interviews, it was suggested the series might comprise nine or twelve films.|$|E
2500|$|In {{part because}} of public {{misunderstanding}} surrounding gothic aesthetics, people in the goth subculture sometimes suffer prejudice, discrimination, and intolerance. As {{is the case with}} members of various other subcultures and alternative lifestyles, outsiders sometimes marginalize goths, either by intention or by accident. Actress Christina Hendricks talked of being bullied as a goth in school and how difficult it was for her to deal with societal pressure: [...] "Kids can be pretty judgmental about people who are different. But instead of breaking down and conforming, I stood firm. That is also probably why I was unhappy. My mother was mortified and <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> me how horrible and ugly I looked. Strangers would walk by with a look of shock on their face, so I never felt pretty. I just always felt awkward". Prejudice moves people into circles of bonding where they share these similar experiences and are accepted. Young goths have to define themselves and learn beauty is an aspect of cultural relativism.|$|E
2500|$|As {{his music}} progressed and {{popularity}} grew, his singing also became very important. Armstrong {{was not the}} first to record scat singing, but he was masterful at it and helped popularize it with the first recording on which he scatted, [...] "Heebie Jeebies". At a recording session for Okeh Records, when the sheet music supposedly fell on the floor and the music began before he could pick up the pages, Armstrong simply started singing nonsense syllables while Okeh president E.A. Fearn, who was at the session, <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> him to continue. Armstrong did, thinking the track would be discarded, but that was the version that was pressed to disc, sold, and became an unexpected hit. Although the story was thought to be apocryphal, Armstrong himself confirmed it in at least one interview as well as in his memoirs. On a later recording, Armstrong also sang out [...] "I done forgot the words" [...] in the middle of recording [...] "I'm A Ding Dong Daddy From Dumas." ...|$|E
5000|$|At a hotel after-party, Bronconius shows Bob a safe {{where the}} Chariot doll is <b>kept,</b> and <b>tells</b> Bob his intent to achieve {{immortality}} by [...] "merging mouths" [...] with the doll. Bob openly recalls a zombie character from Tina's fan fiction, exposing him to Bronconius. Bob's family arrives to rescue Bob as Bronconius prepares to give Bob a large {{tattoo on his}} back {{in the shape of a}} horse with his own face on its posterior. Bronconius sets the other Equesticles on the family, but Tina turns them against him by arguing that he is using their core value of acceptance to achieve his own ends. Bob then calls the front desk to open the safe so he can recover the doll. However, Tina decides she has outgrown the doll and packs it away, thanking Bob for retrieving it anyway. Angered that his tolerance with the series and its fandom has been for nothing, Bob forces Tina to play with the doll before she goes to bed.|$|R
