Inherent in this fascination is the {{assumption}} that <b>global</b> <b>private</b> law threatens the legitimacy of the state by taking over its functions through new techniques of governance. In this article, I build upon research in one arena of <b>global</b> <b>private</b> governance, the production of legal documentation for the global swap markets, to challenge the most prominent assumptions about private law beyond the state. I argue that rather than focusing on how <b>global</b> <b>private</b> law is or is not an artifact of state power, a body of private norms, or a coherent legal system, we should view <b>global</b> <b>private</b> law as a set of institutions, actors, doctrines, ideas, documents, that is, as a specialized set of 2 ̆ 2 knowledge practices. 2 ̆ 2 Viewed from this perspective, <b>global</b> <b>private</b> law is not a radical departure from state law, but really more of the same.

40|$|The central {{question}} {{of this paper}} is how to understand and characterize the parallel development of <b>global</b> <b>private</b> partnerships and other partnerships at the global level or national level, that all aim to promote sustainability of a global commodity. The aim {{of this paper is}} to contribute to the discussion on the role and use of <b>global</b> <b>private</b> partnerships in coping with sustainability as a wicked problem. For this purpose we have constructed and used a theoretical framework on complex decision-making processes with a grounded theory that explains diversity of <b>private</b> governance <b>networks</b> in terms of rivalry and exclusion. Focusing on five partnerships that promote sustainable production of soy in Brazil, the paper concludes that their development is highly interdependent and dialectical. One of the five partnerships is the Round Table on Responsible Soy. Both the start and development of this <b>global</b> <b>private</b> partnership have not ended but fuelled rivalry between different partnerships, herewith reproducing the wickedness of governance of sustainable production of soy. Managing sustainability as a wicked problem requires an understanding of the dialectical development of partnerships. Instead of embracing one partnership as the best or the benchmark, it may be wiser for policymakers to invest in managing interactions and articulating relationships between different partnerships at the global and national level.

40|$|As {{internet}} usage grows exponentially, {{network security}} issues become increasingly important. Network security measures {{are needed to}} protect data during transmission. Various security controls are used to prevent the access of hackers in networks. They are firewall, virtual <b>private</b> <b>networks</b> and encryption algorithms. Out of these, the virtual <b>private</b> <b>network</b> plays {{a vital role in}} preventing hackers from accessing the <b>networks.</b> A Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Network</b> (VPN) provides end users with a way to privately access information on their network over a public network infrastructure such as the internet. Using a technique called “Tunneling”, data packets are transmitted across a public routed network, such as the internet that simulates a point-to-point connection. Virtual <b>private</b> <b>networks</b> provide customers with a secure and low-cost communication environment. The basic structure of the virtual circuit is to create a logical path from the source port to the destination port. This path may incorporate many hops between routers for the formation of the circuit. The final, logical path or virtual circuit acts {{in the same way as}} a direct connection between the two ports. Our proposed Provisioning Restorable Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Networks</b> Algorithm (PRA) is used to combine the provisioning and restoration algorithms to achieve better results than the ones obtained by independent restoration and provisioning. In order to ensure service quality and availability in Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Networks,</b> seamless recovery from failures is essential. The quality of service of the Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Networks</b> is also improved due to the combination of provisioning and restoration. The bandwidth sharing concept is also applied in link to improve the quality of service in the Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Network.</b> The performance analysis of the proposed algorithm is carried out in terms of cost, the number of nodes, the number of VPN nodes, delay, asymmetric ratio and delay with constraints with Disjoint Path Algorithm and Approximation Restoration Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Networks</b> Algorithm.
