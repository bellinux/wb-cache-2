5|$|Francis Bok waited three years, until 1996, {{before he}} tried to escape again. During the {{intervening}} three years <b>he</b> <b>tended</b> to the herds and regained Giemma's trust. Giemma regularly praised Bok's work with the animals yet still forced him {{to live a life}} of slavery.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1980s onwards, <b>he</b> <b>tended</b> to {{concentrate}} on philosophical texts and essays, published {{in a number of}} Polish magazines (Tygodnik Powszechny, Odra, Przegląd, and others). They were later collected in a number of anthologies.|$|E
5|$|Acting {{also plays}} a key role in Szabó’s films, as he values {{psychological}} complexity in his central characters. In his first several features, <b>he</b> <b>tended</b> to use the same lead actors over and over—first András Bálint, then Klaus Maria Brandauer. Consistent with this focus on acting, he frequently employs long close-up shots to emphasize the play of emotions on the faces of his characters.|$|E

5|$|After a brief stay {{among the}} Mormon {{community}} of southern Utah, Harrison {{enlisted in the}} Canadian Army Medical Corps in 1917 and was stationed at a French hospital, where <b>he</b> <b>tended</b> {{to the needs of}} the Chinese Labour Corps. Quickly learning the language and customs of this group of some 200,000 men, Harrison successfully treated many bilharzia, catarrh and tuberculosis cases, significantly reducing the number of sick members of the Corps during the winter of 1917–18.|$|E
5|$|Having {{successfully}} {{dealt with}} the major challenges and issues involved in forming a new state government, Shelby left the state safe and financially sound. Kentucky's constitution prevented a governor from serving consecutive terms, so Shelby retired to Traveler's Rest, his Lincoln County estate, {{at the conclusion of}} his term in 1796. For the next 15 years <b>he</b> <b>tended</b> to affairs on his farm. He was selected as a presidential elector in six consecutive elections, but these were his only appearances in public life during this period.|$|E
5|$|He was {{a member}} of the Washington Light Infantry, a local Washington, D.C. militia, and played in many of their amateur {{baseball}} games throughout his life. When not playing, <b>he</b> <b>tended</b> to his bar. Noted for being a genial, friendly individual, he was quick to make friends, and was a fan-favorite in his hometown of Washington, D.C. Kinslow was a heavy drinker however, which caused him to miss games and team movements on occasion. Late into his career, these alcohol issues were much less tolerated, eventually hastening his exit from the game. He died at the age of 35, after a year-long battle with tuberculosis.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, he was {{transferred}} to Fort Myer in Virginia. While stationed there, Matthews {{and some of his}} troops were escorts for King George VI and his wife Queen Elizabeth when they came to visit President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House. He earned acclaim for his horse shows, which helped sell war bonds during World War II and <b>he</b> <b>tended</b> to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt's personal horses. He also played on the polo team while stationed in the state.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} show the {{differences}} between communication styles, Rosenberg started to use two animals. Violent communication was represented by the carnivorous Jackal {{as a symbol of}} aggression and especially dominance. The herbivorous Giraffe on the other hand, represented his NVC strategy. The Giraffe was chosen as symbol for NVC as its long neck is supposed to show the clear-sighted speaker, being aware of his fellow speakers' reactions; and because the Giraffe has a large heart, representing the compassionate side of NVC. In his courses <b>he</b> <b>tended</b> to use these animals {{in order to make the}} differences in communication clearer to the audience.|$|E
5|$|While Hawks was not {{sympathetic}} to feminism, he popularized the Hawksian woman archetype, a portrayal {{of women in}} more strong, less effeminate roles. Such an emphasis had never {{been done in the}} 1920s and therefore was seen to be a rarity and, according to Naomi Wise, has been cited as a prototype of the post-feminist movement. Another notable theme carried throughout his work included the relationship of morality and human interaction. In this sense <b>he</b> <b>tended</b> to portray more dramatic elements of a concept or a plot in a humorous way.|$|E

5|$|Across {{the rest}} of the five-match Test series against South Africa, Ring took only seven more wickets, and <b>he</b> <b>tended</b> to be {{expensive}} {{in terms of the number}} of runs conceded from his bowling. In the second match, which the South Africans won, he took three wickets for 187, and, batting at No 10, contributed a quick-fire 53 out of the last 74 runs when the match had already effectively been lost. Two weeks later, in the third match, he took just one wicket in a crushing Australian victory, but contributed 58 out of 75 in just 68 minutes from the unusually lofty batting position of No 8. The fourth and fifth Tests brought him few runs or wickets. In the series as a whole, Ring scored 184 runs at an average of 23 runs per innings and took 13 wickets at the high average of 48.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not certain}} whether the year of Hamilton's birth was 1755 or 1757. Most {{historical}} evidence after Hamilton's arrival in North America supports {{the idea that he}} was born in 1757, including Hamilton's own writings. Hamilton listed his birth year as 1757 when he first arrived in the Thirteen Colonies, and celebrated his birthday on January 11. In later life, <b>he</b> <b>tended</b> to give his age only in round figures. Historians accepted 1757 as his birth year until about 1930, when additional documentation of his early life in the Caribbean was published, initially in Danish. A probate paper from St. Croix in 1768, drafted after the death of Hamilton's mother, listed him as 13 years old, which has caused some historians since the 1930s to favor a birth year of 1755.|$|E
5|$|Like many ex-Army officers, <b>he</b> <b>tended</b> to see {{air power}} in the {{tactical}} role, providing support to land operations. In the historiography of the Luftwaffe Kesselring and Hans-Jürgen Stumpff are usually blamed for neglecting strategic bombing while over-focusing on close air support for the army. However the two most prominent enthusiasts for the focus on ground-support operations (direct or indirect) were actually Hugo Sperrle and Hans Jeschonnek. The two men were long-time professional airmen involved in German air services since their early careers. The Luftwaffe was not pressured into ground support operations due to demands from the army, or because it was led by ex-army personnel like Kesselring. Interdiction and close air support were operations that suited the Luftwaffe's pre-existing approach to warfare; a culture of joint inter-service operations, rather than independent strategic air campaigns. Moreover, many in the Luftwaffe command believed medium bombers to be sufficient in power for use in strategic bombing operations against Germany's most likely enemies; Britain and France.|$|E

5|$|William Beebe {{was more}} {{famous in the}} United States than any other American naturalist prior {{to the days of}} television. As a {{scientific}} writer who participated in both the popular and academic worlds, he occupied a similar role to the role later occupied by Stephen Jay Gould. Beebe was a well-known figure in the Roaring Twenties of New York City, and was friends with numerous other well-known figures of the period, including Fannie Hurst and the cartoonist Rube Goldberg. Although he was not physically handsome in the traditional sense, <b>he</b> <b>tended</b> to dominate every social and professional situation due to his enthusiasm, intelligence and charisma. As a result of his much-publicized divorce from Blair and his later marriage to Elswyth, he was also known for his stormy relationships with women.|$|E
5|$|Zaphod, {{named after}} Zaphod Beeblebrox from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, was Flower's devoted partner and the {{dominant}} male of the Whiskers. As Zaphod assumed both roles by usurping, <b>he</b> <b>tended</b> to be edgy if Yossarian got {{too close to}} Flower. According to the Meerkat Manor: The Series Begins film, Zaphod was a roving Lazuli male before he joined the Whiskers. He was really born in the Vivian, not the Lazuil. He and his younger brother, Yossarian, visited the Whiskers {{at the same time}} in search of females. Flower's sister Viale, then the dominant female, chose Yossarian as her mate and he became the group's dominant male. Zaphod and Flower also mated, but Viale killed the resulting pups. After Viale's death, Flower assumed the role of dominant female and showed preference to Zaphod for her mate. Yossarian then left the group for an unknown length of time.|$|E
5|$|Brown missed {{selection}} {{for the tour}} opener against Worcestershire—in which Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice XI—before making his debut in the second match against Leicestershire. He made a century against Cambridge University in his second tour match, making 105 in the middle order. Batting at number3 against Lancashire in the final tour match before the Tests, Brown scored 119. After compiling 351 runs at 43.88 in the opening tour matches, Brown was selected for the Test side. Playing in all five Tests, Brown made his debut at Trent Bridge, Nottingham and scored 22 in his first innings. After Australia lost three early wickets in the second innings, Brown scored 73 to help secure a winning lead. Brown then made a century while opening the batting against Northamptonshire, and an unbeaten 62 in the second innings, guiding Australia to an eight-wicket victory over the Gentlemen of England. He was promoted {{to open in the}} Second Test at Lord's with Woodfull, after Ponsford was unavailable due to illness. At the home of cricket, Brown made his maiden Test century, scoring 105 in the first innings. His innings was an unhurried one; <b>he</b> <b>tended</b> to wait for the ball to come onto the bat rather than attacking the leather. However, he was unable to prevent Australia from being forced to follow-on and made two the match ended in an innings defeat. He was retained as opener upon Ponsford's return for the Third Test, with Woodfull dropping down the order in a reshuffled batting line-up. Brown made 72 and a duck. The match ended in a draw after both teams passed 490 in the first innings.|$|E
