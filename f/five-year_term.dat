5|$|A {{two-year period}} of {{political}} turmoil followed {{the general election}} of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; {{it was followed by}} two comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which depended on external support. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a <b>five-year</b> <b>term.</b> In the 2004 Indian general elections, again no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India's communist parties.
