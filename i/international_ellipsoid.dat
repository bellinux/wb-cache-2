5000|$|It {{used the}} <b>International</b> <b>Ellipsoid</b> of 1924 ("Hayford-Ellipsoid" [...] of 1909) (radius of the Earth's equator 6378.388 km, {{flattening}} 1/297, both exact). That spheroid {{was an early}} attempt to model the whole Earth and was widely used around the world until the 1980s when GRS 80 and WGS 84 were established.|$|E
50|$|The Hayford {{ellipsoid}} is a geodetic reference ellipsoid, {{named after}} the US geodesist John Fillmore Hayford (1868-1925), which was introduced in 1910. The Hayford ellipsoid was {{also referred to as}} the <b>International</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> 1924 after it had been adopted by the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics IUGG in 1924, and was recommended for use all over the world. Many countries retained their previous ellipsoids.|$|E
50|$|This {{means that}} if the lines are further west, the {{longitude}} value of any given point becomes more easterly. Similarly, if the lines are south, the values become northerly. This {{is due to the}} fact that the <b>International</b> <b>Ellipsoid</b> is larger than the GRS 80/WGS 84 ellipsoid, so a given north-south distance will cover more latitude on the new ellipsoid, and a given east-west distance will cover more longitude.|$|E
50|$|Many methods {{exist for}} {{determination}} of the axes of an Earth ellipsoid, ranging from meridian arcs up to modern satellite geodesy or the analysis and interconnection of continental geodetic networks. Amongst the different set of data used in national surveys are several of special importance: the Bessel ellipsoid of 1841, the <b>international</b> Hayford <b>ellipsoid</b> of 1924, and (for GPS positioning) the WGS84 ellipsoid.|$|R
40|$|Different {{forms of}} the {{theoretical}} gravity formula are summarized and methods of standardization of gravity anomalies obtained from satellite gravity and terrestrial gravity data {{are discussed in the}} context of three most commonly used reference figures, e. g., <b>International</b> Reference <b>Ellipsoid,</b> Reference Ellipsoid 1967, and Equilibrium Reference Ellipsoid. These methods are important in the comparison and combination of satellite gravity and gravimetric data as well as the integration of surface gravity data, collected with different objectives, in a single reference system. For ready reference, tables for such reductions are computed. Nature of the satellite gravity anomalies is examined to aid the geophysical and geodetic interpretation of these anomalies in terms of the tectonic features of the earth and the structure of the earth's crust and mantle. Computation of the Potsdam correction from satellite-determined geopotential is reviewed. The contribution of the satellite gravity results in decomposing the total observed gravity anomaly into components of geophysical interest is discussed. Recent work on the possible temporal variations in the geogravity field is briefly reviewed...|$|R
40|$|If de Sitter's {{hydrostatic}} equations {{are developed}} {{independent of the}} external potential theory, the hydrostatic geopotential coefficient J(sub h) occurs explicitly {{on the right-hand side}} of those equations. J(sub h) here has to be treated as an unknown in the solution, it becomes rather difficult to solve the equations independently, regardless of which of the dynamical parameters associated with the earth is taken as the initial datum. Solution is possible, however, {{with the help of a}} boundary condition derived from the external potential theory which neither assumes nor discounts the presence of equilibrium conditions in the earth's interior. If a general solution i s constructed on this basis, the three particular solutions, usually quoted in literature, stem from it in the wake of the appropriate assumptions. Of course, the only meaningful solution [...] of these [...] is that corresponding to the polar moment of inertia as the initial datum. It is essential that the solution be constructed in this way in order to demonstrate clearly the correct structure of the problem of hydrostatic equilibrium. The anomalous gravity field of the earth referred to the hydrostatic figure is compared with that referred to the <b>international</b> reference <b>ellipsoid...</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{ellipsoidal}} model describes {{only the}} ellipsoid's geometry and a normal gravity field formula {{to go with}} it. Commonly an ellipsoidal model {{is part of a}} more encompassing geodetic datum. For example, the older ED-50 (European Datum 1950) is based on the Hayford or <b>International</b> <b>Ellipsoid.</b> WGS-84 is peculiar in that the same name is used for both the complete geodetic reference system and its component ellipsoidal model. Nevertheless, the two concepts—ellipsoidal model and geodetic reference system—remain distinct.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century the Zentralbüro für die Internationale Erdmessung (Central Bureau for International Geodesy) was {{established}} by Austria-Hungary and Germany. One of its most important goals was the derivation of an <b>international</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> and a gravity formula which should be optimal not only for Europe {{but also for the}} whole world. The Zentralbüro was an early predecessor of the International Association of Geodesy (IAG) and the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) which was founded in 1919.|$|E
50|$|At the 1967 {{meeting of}} the IUGG held in Lucerne, Switzerland, the {{ellipsoid}} called GRS-67 (Geodetic Reference System 1967) in the listing was recommended for adoption. The new ellipsoid was not recommended to replace the <b>International</b> <b>Ellipsoid</b> (1924), but was advocated for use where {{a greater degree of}} accuracy is required. It became a part of the GRS-67 which was approved and adopted at the 1971 {{meeting of the}} IUGG held in Moscow. It is used in Australia for the Australian Geodetic Datum and in South America for the South American Datum 1969.|$|E
50|$|The {{reference}} ellipsoid models listed below have had utility in geodetic work {{and many are}} still in use. The older ellipsoids are named for the individual who derived them and the year of development is given. In 1887 the English surveyor Colonel Alexander Ross Clarke CB FRS RE was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Society {{for his work in}} determining the figure of the Earth. The <b>international</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> was developed by John Fillmore Hayford in 1910 and adopted by the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) in 1924, which recommended it for international use.|$|E
50|$|The {{ellipsoid}} data {{published by}} Bessel (1841) were then {{the best and}} most modern data mapping the Earth's figure. They were used by almost all national surveys. Some surveys in Asia switched to the Clarke ellipsoid of 1880. After the arrival of the geophysical reduction techniques many projects used other examples such as the Hayford ellipsoid of 1910 which was adopted in 1924 by the International Association of Geodesy (IAG) as the <b>International</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> 1924. All of them are influenced by geophysical effects like vertical deflection, mean continental density, rock density and the distribution of network data. Every reference ellipsoid deviates from the worldwide data (e.g. of satellite geodesy) {{in the same way as}} the pioneering work of Bessel.|$|E
50|$|Most American {{published}} sources do {{not indicate}} an origin for the UTM system. The NOAA website states {{the system to}} have been developed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and published material that does state an origin apparently based on that account. However, a series of aerial photos found in the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv (the military section of the German Federal Archives) apparently dating from 1943-1944 bear the inscription UTMREF followed by grid letters and digits, and projected according to the transverse Mercator, a finding that would indicate that something called the UTM Reference system {{was developed in the}} 1942-43 time frame by the Wehrmacht. It was probably carried out by the Abteilung für Luftbildwesen (Department for Aerial Photography). From 1947 onward the US Army employed a very similar system, but with the now-standard 0.9996 scale factor at the central meridian as opposed to the German 1.0. For areas within the contiguous United States the Clarke Ellipsoid of 1866 was used. For the remaining areas of Earth, including Hawaii, the <b>International</b> <b>Ellipsoid</b> was used. The WGS84 ellipsoid is now generally used to model the Earth in the UTM coordinate system, which means current UTM northing at a given point can differ up to 200 meters from the old. For different geographic regions, other datum systems (e.g.: ED50, NAD83) can be used.|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the gravity field of the earth using a {{combined}} solution from free air anomalies and satellite data. Spherical harmonics up to order 8. 8 have been computed in a joint solution. Satellite data from Doppler tracking (NWL) and optical observations (SAO) were added in a combined solution with full consideration of the complete covariance matrix. -This study was based on the most complete set of gravity data so far presented (approximately 500, 000). The simplest type of a world geodetic system includes only geometrical observations. Such systems have a limited geodetic application because no dynamic properties can be derived from purely geometrical observations. A geodetic system {{that is going to be}} used for ballistic applications has to incorporate a solution of the gravi-metric boundary value problem consistent with the geometrical representation. Present geodetic systems already include a number of dynamic parameters presented in the form of so-called geoids. These geoids are establishing valuable reference systems mainly in a conservative application, i. e., when geometrical measurements are reduced to an analytical reference surface (normally the <b>international</b> <b>ellipsoid)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The {{combined}} approach {{of gravity and}} seismic refraction techniques {{was used to determine}} depths of the Cenozoic section and fault patterns of the Colorado delta region. Bouguer gravity anomalies range from − 10 to − 88 mgal with respect to the <b>International</b> <b>Ellipsoid,</b> and the trend of isogal contours is northwesterly. In the center of the basin, depths to basement estimated from gravity data are less than known minimum depths determined from seismic refraction profiles. This discrepancy suggests density complexities within the deeper parts of the stratigraphic section, an interpretation that is supported by sparse measurements from well samples; local isostatic compensation may also contribute to the discrepancy but is not thought to be the major cause. Measured seismic velocities ranged from 5650 to 20, 000 ft/sec, and several consistent velocity zones were widespread above the pre-Tertiary basement; indicated depths to basement varied from 2200 feet to at least 15, 400 feet, the greatest depth being near the international border. Many members of the San Andreas fault system are well delineated by gravity and seismic data, including the Elsinore and San Jacinto faults and a fault beneath the Sand Hills. Of these, the San Jacinto fault appears to be the most continuous through the delta region, but all appear to be en echelon to the trend of the San Andreas fault system as a whole...|$|E
40|$|Gravity and seismic {{studies in}} Mono Basin, Mono County, California, {{completed}} {{during the summer}} of 1957 revealed a large, roughly triangular block that had subsided about 18, 000 ± 5000 feet and received an accumulation of about 300 ± 100 cubic miles of light clastic sediments and volcanic material of Cenozoic age. The seemingly near-vertical faults that bound this great block are displaced {{toward the center of the}} basin from the surrounding mountain masses, but in general they are parallel to well-defined Basin and Range trends. The gravity minimum anomaly associated with the Mono Basin structure has a residual gravity relief of about 50 mgals, and the lowest gravity readings (on Paoha Island) yield a complete Bouguer gravity value of about — 260 mgals with respect to the <b>International</b> <b>Ellipsoid.</b> The computed depth of subsidence is based on a density of 2. 3 gms/cm^ 3 for the basin fill and 2. 7 gms/cm^ 3 for the basement rocks. Seismic-refraction profiles at several places in the basin demonstrate that the Cenozoic deposits are thick where the gravity is low and relatively thin where the gravity is higher. Along common seismic and gravity profiles steep seismic dips coincide with steep gravity gradients. Numerous seismic reflections are present within the basin fill. Anomalies on four aeromagnetic profiles are related in part to volcanic material within the Cenozoic section. It is concluded that Mono Basin may be a volcano-tectonic depression caused by subsidence along faults, following extrusion of magma from a magma chamber at depth. Volcanic rocks of Pliocene(?) and Pleistocene ages are exceptionally abundant in this area...|$|E
