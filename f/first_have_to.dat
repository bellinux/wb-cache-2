5|$|Access {{to foreign}} {{carriers}} on domestic routes is disallowed, while international flights {{will be subject}} to bilateral agreements. To get around this policy, in order to operate within Indonesia, foreign airlines <b>first</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> own and operate an Indonesian-based airline. An example of this practice is Indonesia AirAsia, a branch of Malaysian AirAsia; it previously operated as local airline Awair in 2004, before changed to Indonesia AirAsia in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In January 1960, a {{group of}} local {{businessmen}} approached Carroll about leading a campaign to allow the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to provide electricity to McCracken County. TVA could provide electricity {{at a much lower}} cost, but voters would <b>first</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> hold a public referendum on buying out Kentucky Utilities, the private power provider in the area. Carroll agreed to lead the campaign, and nine months later, voters approved the buyout by a three-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{limitations}} of the Mark III Fat Man, a nuclear strike would have been a formidable undertaking in the post-war 1940s. The lead-acid batteries that powered the fuzing system remained charged for only 36 hours, after which they needed to be recharged. To do this meant disassembling the bomb, and recharging took 72 hours. The batteries had to be removed in any case after nine days or they corroded. The plutonium core could not be left in for much longer, because its heat damaged the high explosives. Replacing the core also required the bomb to be completely disassembled and reassembled. This required about 40 to 50 men and took between 56 and 72 hours, depending on the skill of the bomb assembly team, and in June 1948 the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project had only three teams. The only aircraft capable of carrying the bomb were Silverplate B-29s, and the only group equipped with them was the 509th Bombardment Group at Walker Air Force Base in Roswell, New Mexico. They would <b>first</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fly to Sandia Base to collect the bombs, and then to an overseas base from which a strike could be mounted.|$|E

25|$|The first PC {{operating}} systems to integrate such technology were Compaq DOS 3.31 (via CEMM) and Windows/386 2.1, both released in 1988.

25|$|The {{left and}} right board edge are {{controlled}} by the battery formed by Lance and Chariot. Usually little can be achieved here before you somehow acquire a majority by taking {{out some of the}} opponent's pieces there from the side.

So a majority here is more a tie breaker in case the main battle ends undecided than an immediate advantage.|$|E

25|$|European {{directives}} {{are generally}} not directly enforceable in EU member states. They <b>first</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be transposed into local law, generally {{by an act of}} the legislature of the member state. While they give a general framework and impose some options they may leave significant leeway: in the case of EUCD, for instance, the directive gives a list of optional copyright exceptions, and mandates appropriate legal protection for DRMs, without defining what constitutes an appropriate protection. Member states have to transpose directives within reasonable delays, or they face action by the European Commission. There may be subsequent litigation before the European Court of Justice if subsequent the implementation is deemed to be inadequate.|$|E
25|$|The {{first country}} {{to receive a}} World Bank loan was France. The Bank's {{president}} at the time, John McCloy, chose France over two other applicants, Poland and Chile. The loan was for US$250million, half the amount requested, and it came with strict conditions. France had to agree to produce a balanced budget and give priority of debt repayment to the World Bank over other governments. World Bank staff closely monitored {{the use of the}} funds to ensure that the French government met the conditions. In addition, before the loan was approved, the United States State Department told the French government that its members associated with the Communist Party would <b>first</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be removed. The French government complied and removed the Communist coalition government - the so-called tripartite. Within hours, the loan to France was approved.|$|E
25|$|According to the constitution, {{members of}} the {{assembly}} represent the entire country, not the constituency from which they are elected. This directive has been reinforced in practice by the strong role of political parties in regard to {{members of the}} assembly. Party leadership, for example, determines in which areas candidates are to run for office, thus often weakening members' ties to their constituencies. Moreover, members of the assembly are expected to vote with their party and to work within parliamentary groups based on party membership. Party discipline is strong, and insubordinate members can be coerced through a variety of means. A further obstacle to members' independence is that their bills <b>first</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be submitted to the parliamentary groups, and it is these groups' leaders who set the assembly's agenda.|$|E

25|$|Rommel {{ordered the}} 21st Panzer back to Tobruk and the 15th Panzer was to attack forces {{thought to be}} besieging the border {{positions}} between Fort Capuzzo and Sidi Omar. 15th Panzer would <b>first</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> capture Sidi Azeiz to provide space for this ambitious manoeuvre. Neumann-Silkow, however, felt the plan had little chance of success and resolved to advance to Sidi Azeiz (where he believed {{there was a major}} British supply dump), before heading to Tobruk. Defending the 5th Brigade HQ at Sidi Azeiz was a company of the 22nd Infantry Battalion and the armoured cars of the divisional cavalry plus some field artillery, anti-tank, anti-aircraft and machine gun units. The New Zealanders were overrun early on 27 November. Rommel was present to congratulate Brigadier James Hargest on the determined conduct of his men's defence. Some 700 prisoners were taken although the armoured cars escaped.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} José, Kate, and Ana arrive for the photo shoot at the Heathman Hotel, where Christian is staying. Christian asks Ana out {{for coffee and}} asks if she's dating anyone, {{specifically}} José. Ana replies {{that she is not}} dating anyone. During the conversation, Ana learns that Christian is also single, but he says he is not romantic. Ana is intrigued but believes she is not attractive enough for Christian. Later, Ana receives a package from Christian containing first edition copies of Tess of the d'Urbervilles, which stuns her. Later that night, Ana goes out drinking with her friends and ends up drunk dialling Christian, who informs her that he will be coming to pick her up because of her inebriated state. Ana goes outside to get some fresh air, and José attempts to kiss her, but he is stopped by Christian's arrival. Ana leaves with Christian, but not before she discovers that Kate has been flirting with Christian's brother, Elliot. Later, Ana wakes to find herself in Christian's hotel room, where he scolds her for not taking proper care of herself. Christian then reveals {{that he would like to}} have sex with her. He initially says that Ana will <b>first</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fill out paperwork, but later goes back on this statement after making out with her in the elevator.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 1993 season, Sabatini {{continued}} to advance deep into grand slam singles events. At the Australian Open, she reached the semifinals but lost to the eventual champion, Seles, with a score of 2–6, 1–6. Later that year at Roland Garros, Sabatini was defeated by Fernández in a quarterfinals. Sabatini had raced to a seemingly insurmountable 6–1, 5–1 lead and appeared poised for an easy victory. However, Mary Joe saved five match points on her way to winning a second set tiebreak. Finally, after 3½ hours, Fernández eliminated Sabatini by a final score of 1–6, 7–6 (7–4), 10–8. Despite the setback at the French Open, Sabatini reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, losing to Jana Novotná, a player she had beaten six consecutive times. However, this time Novotná defeated Sabatini in straight sets. At the 1993 US Open, Sabatini had hoped to end the year on a high note, but she would <b>first</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> again get past Graf, this time in the quarterfinals. In their four previous meetings, Graf had beaten Sabatini, but Sabatini was looking to change those recent results. After losing the first set at 2–6, Sabatini raised the level of her game in the second set, winning at 7–5 to even the match at one set apiece. However, in the third and deciding set, Graf dismantled Sabatini with a 6–1 final set to win the match. That year, Sabatini was the only player to abstain from voting against Seles for having her ranking preserved following her stabbing.|$|E

500|$|The book {{begins with}} a {{discussion}} of targeted killing of non-combatants, followed by discussions of legalities, the rationale of self-defence, the choice of targets, and when and whether the ends can be used to justify the means. Several contributors defend targeting of non-combatants, while Jeremy Waldron discusses the morality associated with the tactic and argues against its use. Jeff McMahan identifies the problematic nature of targeted killing and emphasizes regulations for law enforcement to avoid abuse of process. Richard V. Meyer writes that any entity wishing to carry out targeted killing should <b>first</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> declare war on the targeted parties. [...] Kevin H. Govern examines the elimination of Osama Bin Laden and identifies this killing as justified and the product of a rational decision-making process. In the final portion of the book, Fernando Tesón says that targeted killing is particularly justified against terrorists because they use tactics specifically designed to kill civilians.|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} {{portion of the}} book, a group of {{articles}} discuss which sets of laws {{should be used to}} regulate targeted killing. Philosophy professor Jeff McMahan of Rutgers University asks, [...] "Targeted Killing: Murder, Combat or Law Enforcement?". He says that eliminating enemies for purposes of self-defense is justified. McMahan [...] writes about the problematic nature of targeted killing and emphasizes regulations for law enforcement to avoid abuses of process. University of Pennsylvania law and philosophy professor Claire Finkelstein writes in [...] "Targeted Killing as Preemptive Action" [...] about the difficulties of rationalizing targeted killing outside of the realm of typical combat between state actors. Finkelstein characterizes people as noncombatants unless they are a member of a group that includes identification through standardized attire and criminal behaviour patterns. Mississippi College School of Law professor Richard V. Meyer writes that current regulations and standards for targeted killing are inadequate. He says that any entity wishing to carry out targeted killing should <b>first</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> declare war on the targeted parties involved.|$|E
