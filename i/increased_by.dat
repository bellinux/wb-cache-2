40|$|Objectives: This article aims to {{quantify}} the risk factors associated with the human cases of H 5 N 1 avian influenza in South-east Asian countries and China; a dangerous region for this disease {{that has the potential}} for a pandemic outbreak. Study design: A statistical model with time and spatial dimensions was built to capture the international spread patterns of this disease. Methods: The grid search method was used to fit the model with 2004 - 2006 data. The grid search approach is a simple procedure that allows the fit of any function to data. Results: This study found that: (1) when the number of domestic H 5 N 1 human cases <b>increases</b> <b>by</b> one person in a certain time period, the chance that the country will have a human case in the next period <b>increases</b> <b>by</b> 22. 10 %; (2) when the number of human cases in a neighbouring country <b>increases</b> <b>by</b> one person in a certain time period, the chance that the country will have a human case in the next period <b>increases</b> <b>by</b> 1. 62 %; (3) when the number of avian cases in a neighbouring country <b>increases</b> <b>by</b> one, the chance that the country will have a human case <b>increases</b> <b>by</b> 0. 02 %; (4) as the human population <b>increases</b> <b>by</b> one unit. the chance that the country will have a human case <b>increases</b> <b>by</b> 0. 10 %; (5) when the quantity of imported poultry <b>increases</b> <b>by</b> 1000 metric tons, the chance that the country will have a human case <b>increases</b> <b>by</b> 0. 03 %; (6) when the outbreak of the disease among domestic birds <b>increases</b> <b>by</b> one, the chance that the country will have a human case <b>increases</b> <b>by</b> 0. 19 %; and finally (7) when the number of birds destroyed <b>increases</b> <b>by</b> 1000, the chance that the country will have a human case decreases by 0. 30 %. Conclusions: These findings shed new light on the spatiotemporal characteristics of the epidemic, and thus need to be taken into consideration in interdisciplinary and scientific discussion of the disease.
