5|$|Elliptic {{filters are}} filters {{produced}} by the insertion-loss method which use elliptic rational functions in their transfer function as an approximation to the <b>ideal</b> <b>filter</b> response {{and the result is}} called a Chebyshev approximation. This is the same Chebyshev approximation technique used by Cauer on image filters but follows the Darlington insertion-loss design method and uses slightly different elliptic functions. Cauer had some contact with Darlington and Bell Labs before WWII (for a time he worked in the US) but during the war they worked independently, in some cases making the same discoveries. Cauer had disclosed the Chebyshev approximation to Bell Labs but had not left them with the proof. Sergei Schelkunoff provided this and a generalisation to all equal ripple problems. Elliptic filters are a general class of filter which incorporate several other important classes as special cases: Cauer filter (equal ripple in passband and stopband), Chebyshev filter (ripple only in passband), reverse Chebyshev filter (ripple only in stopband) and Butterworth filter (no ripple in either band).|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} response behaviour of all mechanical filters {{can be expressed}} as an equivalent electrical circuit using the impedance analogy described above. An {{example of this is}} shown in figure 8b which is the equivalent circuit of the mechanical filter of figure 8a. Elements on the electrical side, such as the inductance of the magnetostrictive transducer, are omitted but would be taken into account in a complete design. The series resonant circuits on the circuit diagram represent the torsional resonators, and the shunt capacitors represent the coupling wires. The component values of the electrical equivalent circuit can be adjusted, more or less at will, by modifying the dimensions of the mechanical components. In this way, all the theoretical tools of electrical analysis and filter design can be brought to bear on the mechanical design. Any filter realisable in electrical theory can, in principle, also be realised as a mechanical filter. In particular, the popular finite element approximations to an <b>ideal</b> <b>filter</b> response of the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters can both readily be realised. As with the electrical counterpart, the more elements that are used, the closer the approximation approaches the ideal, however, for practical reasons the number of resonators does not normally exceed eight.|$|E

500|$|Waffle-iron {{filters are}} used in {{industrial}} microwave processes. [...] The many industrial applications of microwave energy include drying of food products and industrial films, heating, such as in polyurethane foam production, melting, rendering, sterilising, and vulcanisation. [...] In high-volume production the process is continuous necessitating openings to the microwave chamber where the product can be fed in and exit. [...] Steps {{need to be taken}} to prevent unsafe levels of microwave radiation escaping from these apertures which are often large to accommodate the product. [...] It is usual to line the product feed ducts with microwave absorbent material for this purpose. [...] However, the absorbed microwaves have a heating effect and this can be severe enough to damage the absorbent material. [...] Waffle-iron filters are a useful alternative because the product can be passed between the filter's teeth. [...] An <b>ideal</b> <b>filter</b> will reflect all the unwanted radiation rather than absorbing it so will not suffer from overheating. [...] This {{is an example of a}} filter being used in a choke application. [...] In some processes both techniques are used simultaneously. [...] The waffle-iron is placed nearest the microwave chamber to first reduce the energy to a level which will not cause the absorbent lining to overheat.

50|$|An ideal {{low-pass}} filter completely eliminates all frequencies above the cutoff frequency while passing those below unchanged; its frequency response is a rectangular function {{and is a}} brick-wall filter. The transition region present in practical filters {{does not exist in}} an <b>ideal</b> <b>filter.</b> An ideal {{low-pass filter}} can be realized mathematically (theoretically) by multiplying a signal by the rectangular function in the frequency domain or, equivalently, convolution with its impulse response, a sinc function, in the time domain.|$|E

40|$|The {{coding gain}} in subband coding, a popular {{technique}} for achieving signal compression, {{depends on how}} the input signal spectrum is decomposed into subbands. The optimality of such decomposition is conventionally addressed by designing appropriate filter banks. The issue of optimal decomposition of the input spectrum is addressed by choosing the set of band that, for a given number of bands, will achieve maximum coding gain. A set of necessary conditions for such optimality is derived, and an algorithm to determine the optimal band edges is then proposed. These band edges along with <b>ideal</b> <b>filters,</b> achieve the upper bound of coding gain for a given number of bands. It is shown that with <b>ideal</b> <b>filters,</b> {{as well as with}} realizable filters for some given effective length, such a decomposition system performs better than the conventional nonuniform binary tree-structured decomposition in some cases for AR sources as well as image...|$|R

50|$|However, the <b>ideal</b> <b>filter</b> is {{impossible}} to realize without also having signals of infinite extent in time, and so generally needs to be approximated for real ongoing signals, because the sinc function's support region extends to all past and future times. The filter would therefore need to have infinite delay, or knowledge of the infinite future and past, in order to perform the convolution. It is effectively realizable for pre-recorded digital signals by assuming extensions of zero into the past and future, or more typically by making the signal repetitive and using Fourier analysis.|$|E
50|$|In addition, signals must be {{low-pass}} filtered before sampling to avoid aliasing. While an ideal low-pass filter would perfectly pass frequencies below 20 kHz (without attenuating them) and perfectly cut off frequencies above 20 kHz, such an <b>ideal</b> <b>filter</b> is theoretically impossible (it is noncausal), so in practice a transition band is necessary, where frequencies are partly attenuated. The wider this transition band is, the {{easier and more}} economical {{it is to make}} an anti-aliasing filter. The 44.1 kHz sampling frequency allows for a 2.05 kHz transition band.|$|E

50|$|Alternatively, {{a signal}} may be {{intentionally}} oversampled without an intermediate frequency {{to reduce the}} requirements on the anti-alias filter. For example, CD audio typically extends up to 20 kHz, but is sampled with a 22.05 kHz Nyquist rate. By oversampling by 2.05 kHz, both aliasing and attenuation of higher audio frequencies can be prevented even with less than <b>ideal</b> <b>filters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Maximal {{filters are}} {{sometimes}} called ultrafilters, but this terminology is often reserved for Boolean algebras, where a maximal <b>filter</b> (<b>ideal)</b> is a <b>filter</b> (<b>ideal)</b> that contains exactly {{one of the}} elements {a, ¬a}, for each element a of the Boolean algebra.

5000|$|Each {{family of}} filters can be {{specified}} to a particular order. The higher the order, the more the filter will approach the [...] "ideal" [...] filter; but also the longer the impulse response is and the longer the latency will be. An <b>ideal</b> <b>filter</b> has full transmission in the pass band, complete attenuation in the stop band, and an abrupt transition between the two bands, but this filter has infinite order (i.e., the response cannot be expressed as a linear differential equation with a finite sum) and infinite latency (i.e., its compact support in the Fourier transform forces its time response to be ever lasting).|$|E
50|$|Although the Gabor filter {{achieves}} {{a sense of}} optimality {{in terms of the}} space-frequency tradeoff, in certain applications it might not be an <b>ideal</b> <b>filter.</b> At certain bandwidths, the Gabor filter has a non-zero DC component. This means that the response of the filter depends on the mean value of the signal. If the output of the filter is to be used for an application such as pattern recognition, this DC component is undesirable because it gives a feature that changes with the average value. As we will soon see, the Log-Gabor filter does not exhibit this problem. Also the original Gabor filter has an infinite length impulse response. Finally, the original Gabor filter, while optimum in the sense of uncertainty, does not properly fit the statistics of natural images. As shown in, it is better to choose a filter with a longer sloping tail in an image coding task.|$|E
50|$|Digital {{images are}} usually {{stored in a}} gamma-compressed format, but most optical {{anti-aliasing}} filters are linear. So to down-sample an image {{in a way that}} would match optical blurring, one should first convert it to a linear format, then apply the anti-aliasing filter, and finally convert it back to a gamma compressed format. Using linear arithmetic on a gamma-compressed image results in values which are slightly different from the <b>ideal</b> <b>filter.</b> This error is larger when dealing with high contrast areas, causing high contrast areas to become dimmer: bright details (such as a cat's whiskers) become visually thinner, and dark details (such as tree branches) become thicker, relative to the optically anti-aliased image.Because the conversion to and from a linear format greatly slows down the process, and because the differences are usually subtle, almost all image editing software, including Final Cut Pro, Adobe Photoshop and GIMP, process images in the gamma-compressed domain.|$|E
