An important difference with the 2010s period is that international traders are much better able to hedge their exposures to exchange rate volatility due to more sophisticated financial markets. A second difference is that during the later period devaluations have invariably been effected by nations expanding their money supplies—either by creating money to buy foreign currency, {{in the case of}} direct interventions, or by creating money to inject into their domestic economies, with quantitative easing. If all nations try to devalue at once, the net effect on exchange rates could cancel out leaving them largely unchanged, but the <b>expansionary</b> <b>effect</b> of the interventions would remain. So while there has been no collaborative intent, some economists such as Berkeley's Barry Eichengreen and Goldman Sachs's Dominic Wilson have suggested the net effect will be similar to semi-coordinated monetary expansion which will help the global economy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rational}} expectations hypothesis {{has been used}} to support some strong conclusions about economic policymaking. An example is the policy ineffectiveness proposition developed by Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace. If the Federal Reserve attempts to lower unemployment through expansionary monetary policy economic agents will anticipate the effects of the change of policy and raise their expectations of future inflation accordingly. This in turn will counteract the <b>expansionary</b> <b>effect</b> of the increased money supply. All that the government can do is raise the inflation rate, not employment. This is a distinctly New Classical outcome. During the 1970s {{rational expectations}} appeared to have made previous macroeconomic theory largely obsolete, which culminated with the Lucas critique. However, rational expectations theory has been widely adopted as a modelling assumption even outside of New Classical macroeconomics thanks to the work of New Keynesians such as Stanley Fischer.|$|E

This tract sought {{to quantify the}} railroads' contribution to U.S. {{economic growth in the}} 19th century. Its argument and method were each rebuttals to a long line of non-numeric historical arguments that had ascribed much to <b>expansionary</b> <b>effect</b> to railroads without rigorous reference to economic data. Fogel argued against these previous historical arguments to show that onset of the railroad was not indispensable to the American economy. Examining the transportation of agricultural goods, Fogel compared the 1890 economy to a hypothetical 1890 economy in which transportation infrastructure was limited to wagons, canals, and natural waterways. Fogel pointed out that the absence of railroads would have substantially increased transportation costs from farms to primary markets, particularly in the Midwest, and changed the geographic location of agricultural production. Despite this consideration, the overall increase in transportation costs, i.e., the [...] "social savings" [...] attributable to railroads, was small - about 2.7% of 1890 GNP. The potential for substitute technologies, such as a more extensive canal system or improved roads, would have further lowered the importance of railroads. The conclusion that railroads were not indispensable to economic development made a controversial name for cliometrics.|$|E
5000|$|If {{increased}} borrowing {{leads to}} {{higher interest rates}} by creating a greater demand for money and loanable funds and hence a higher [...] "price" [...] (ceteris paribus), the private sector, which is sensitive to interest rates, will likely reduce investment due to a lower rate of return. This is the investment that is crowded out. The weakening of fixed investment and other interest-sensitive expenditure counteracts to varying extents the <b>expansionary</b> <b>effect</b> of government deficits. More importantly, a fall in fixed investment by business can hurt long-term economic growth of the supply side, i.e., the growth of potential output.Thus, {{the situation in which}} borrowing may lead to crowding out is that companies would like to expand productive capacity, but, because of high interest rates, cannot borrow funds with which to do so. According to American economist Jared Bernstein, writing in 2011, this scenario is [...] "not a plausible story with excess capacity, the Fed funds interest rate at zero, and companies sitting on cash that they could invest with if they saw good reasons to do so." [...] Another American economist, Paul Krugman, pointed out that, after the beginning of the recession in 2008, the federal government's borrowing increased by hundreds of billions of dollars, leading to warnings about crowding out, but instead interest rates had actually fallen. When aggregate demand is low, government spending tends to expand the market for private-sector products through the fiscal multiplier and thus stimulates - or [...] "crowds in" [...] - fixed investment (via the [...] "accelerator effect"). This accelerator effect is most important when business suffers from unused industrial capacity, i.e., during a serious recession or a depression.|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to explore the {{potential}} <b>expansionary</b> <b>effect</b> stemming from the monetization of debt. We develop a simple macroeconomic model with Keynesian features and four sectors: creditor households, debtor households, businesses, and the public sector.

The efficacy of the channel that allegedly operates through the compression of the risk/term premium on securities is found to be ambiguous. Finally, we show that a country that issues its own currency can avoid becoming stuck in a structural "liquidity trap," provided its central bank is willing to monetize the debt created by a strong enough fiscal expansion.

40|$|The {{short-term}} {{effects of}} fiscal consolidation have attracted an increasing attention {{from both the}} academia and policy makers in the recent years.

However, as the following critical assessment of the literature on expansionary fiscal consolidations will reveal, institutional conditions, such as the importance of the depth of financial intermediation and the influencing role of labour market structure, can prove to be crucial in the occurrence of the desired <b>expansionary</b> short-term <b>effects...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I study {{the effects of}} real {{exchange}} rate devaluations on output performance using a sample of large devaluation episodes for a group of emerging and developed countries. I find that balance sheet effects, captured by the interaction between the real exchange rate devaluation and the level of external indebtedness of the country, have a significant and negative impact on output. Nevertheless, there is also evidence of a positive effect of the real devaluation associated to the traditional <b>expansionary</b> <b>effect.</b> For countries with large foreign-denominated external debt, the combined effect of the real exchange rate depreciation is likely to generate significant output losses in the short-run. However, in the medium term, the <b>expansionary</b> <b>effect</b> of the real devaluation tends to dominate the balance sheet effect, which implies a positive effect on output in the medium term. Finally, countries with deeper financial market experience lower output losses following a devaluation. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the effects of}} {{government}} debt on macroeconomic aggregates in a non-Ricardian framework.

We analyze the effects of debt-financed tax cuts. We show that the interest rate rises, entailing higher markups, which imply a fall in employment and consumption. It is particularily noteworthy that, even without capital, a crowding out effect of government debt is obtained in the long run. However, the short-run <b>expansionary</b> <b>effect</b> of debt-financed tax cuts, which would eventually be expected in a non-Ricardian framework, fails to occur. This is due to our flexible-price framework.

The literature on large episodes of fiscal consolidation focuses on the possible <b>expansionary</b> <b>effects</b> linked to the forward-looking behaviour of agents (e.g., Giavazzi and Pagano, 1990; Alesina et al., 2002) and on the effectiveness of these episodes in durably improving the state of public finances (e.g., Alesina and Ardagna, 1998). Another stream of literature focuses on the estimation of fiscal multipliers. Most of the empirical literature based on structural VARs identifies fiscal shocks from a-priori information on the impact of the cycle on revenues and expenditures and generally find significantly positive multipliers, but seldom larger than one (e.g., Blanchard and Perotti, 2002; Perotti, 2005).|$|R
