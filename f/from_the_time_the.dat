5|$|Fremantle Prison {{comprises}} substantially intact convict era structures, {{including the}} limestone perimeter walls of exceptional heritage significance. Other structures, dating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> precinct was in {{use as a}} colonial and state prison, are also significant. The convict era complex includes the 1859 main cell block, chapel and wards, yards and refractory cells; perimeter walls, gate house complex and prison officer residences on the Terrace; service buildings and hospital; south-eastern workshops; ramp access tramway (Fairbairn Street) and Henderson Street Warder's Cottages. Other elements which contribute to the site's overall heritage significance include the western workshops (1900); new division (1907); and conversion of service building to the female division {{and the addition of}} an eastern range (1889–1909).|$|E
5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> GPK was authorised, {{controversy}} raged {{about the}} route a railway to England might take. It was plain that Carlisle would be reached from the south; a direct route from Glasgow over the Southern Uplands, the route that {{became known as}} the Annandale line, would involve severe gradients, and pass through almost unpopulated territory. The locomotives available at the time were not thought to be capable of climbing the steep inclines, and rope haulage was put forward by some as the solution. By contrast, a route from Kilmarnock through Cumnock and Dumfries—the Nithsdale line—would have much easier gradients and pass through considerable population centres, bringing in additional traffic. Moreover, the Nithsdale route would be much cheaper to build.|$|E

5|$|Porpoises, {{along with}} whales and dolphins, are {{descendants}} of land-living ungulates (hoofed animals) that first entered the oceans around 50 {{million years ago}} (Mya). During the Miocene (23 to 5 Mya), mammals were fairly modern, meaning they seldom changed physiologically <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>The</b> cetaceans diversified, and fossil evidence suggests porpoises and dolphins diverged from their last common ancestor around 15 Mya. The oldest fossils are known from the shallow seas around the North Pacific, with animals spreading to the European coasts and Southern Hemisphere only much later, during the Pliocene.|$|E
5|$|As {{attorney}} general, Crittenden issued {{only one}} notable opinion.

Treasury Secretary Thomas Ewing asked Crittenden whether the court had the authority to award interest and whether or not it should be paid. Crittenden opined that it did not, and Ewing did not pay the interest. Crittenden's opinion was used as a precedent in similar cases by future attorneys general.|$|E

5|$|The {{restoration}} of the Walt Disney World Railroad's four locomotives, {{as well as the}} construction of five new open-air Narragansett-style excursion cars for each of them (twenty in total), was completed in less than two years. The first completed set of five passenger cars was delivered to the Magic Kingdom park in April 1971 and the first completed locomotive arrived on May 15, 1971, several months before the park's opening. Like the steam trains running on the Disneyland Railroad during Disneyland's opening day on July 17, 1955, the steam trains for the WDWRR were the first attraction in the Magic Kingdom park to be finished, and they have been operating in the park ever since it opened on October 1, 1971. George Britton, who was instrumental in getting the WDWRR's locomotives refurbished, became the railroad's foreman <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> railroad opened until his retirement on June 6, 2006.
