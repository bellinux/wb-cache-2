25|$|The {{methodology}} {{was first}} used by the Finnish military in the Mannerheim line, but had been drawn up in detail by General Teofil Hárosy, the Hungarian pioneer, in 1939-1940. The protective capacity would be provided by multiple lines of well-designed obstacles fitting into the environment and relief rather than bunkers. Every road passable by tanks and trucks was closed by hurdles, but the intermediate areas were unprotected. Ergo the hostile infantry and cavalry could surpass the fortified line, but every battlegroup without resupply quickly run out of ammo and food, after which a much smaller friendly mobile force could beat them. Thus the <b>flexible</b> <b>line</b> based on small, circularly defensible fortified zones and small but rapid pursuer troops, rather than a continuous impenetrable fortress-line. Most of the roads has been destroyed in forested, mountainous or swampy areas between forts. Therefore, the main task of defenders was to protect the obstacles, and not fight with the main attacking forces.|$|E
60|$|Why can't one sit still? Here in Sicily {{it is so}} pleasant: {{the sunny}} Ionian sea, the {{changing}} jewel of Calabria, like a fire-opal moved in the light; Italy and the panorama of Christmas clouds, night with the dog-star laying a long, luminous gleam across the sea, as if baying at us, Orion marching above; how the dog-star Sirius looks at one, looks at one! he is the hound of heaven, green, glamorous and fierce!--and then oh regal evening star, hung westward flaring over the jagged dark precipices of tall Sicily: then Etna, that wicked witch, resting her thick white snow under heaven, and slowly, slowly rolling her orange-coloured smoke. They called her the Pillar of Heaven, the Greeks. It seems wrong at first, for she trails up in a long, magical, <b>flexible</b> <b>line</b> from the sea's edge to her blunt cone, and does not seem tall. She seems rather low, under heaven. But as one knows her better, oh awe and wizardy! Remote under heaven, aloof, so near, yet never with us. The painters try to paint her, and the photographers to photograph her, in vain. Because why? Because the near ridges, with their olives and white houses, these are with us. Because the river-bed, and Naxos under the lemon groves, Greek Naxos deep under dark-leaved, many-fruited lemon groves, Etna's skirts and skirt-bottoms, these still are our world, our own world. Even the high villages among the oaks, on Etna. But Etna herself, Etna of the snow and secret changing winds, she is beyond a crystal wall. When I look at her, low, white, witch-like under heaven, slowly rolling her orange smoke and giving sometimes a breath of rose-red flame, then I must look away from earth, into the ether, into the low empyrean. And there, in that remote region, Etna is alone. If you would see her, you must slowly take off your eyes from the world and go a naked seer to the strange chamber of the empyrean. Pedestal of heaven! The Greeks {{had a sense of}} the magic truth of things. Thank goodness one still knows enough about them to find one's kinship at last. There are so many photographs, there are so infinitely many water-colour drawings and oil paintings which purport to render Etna. But pedestal of heaven! You must cross the invisible border. Between the foreground, which is our own, and Etna, pivot of winds in lower heaven, there is a dividing line. You must change your state of mind. A metempsychosis. It is no use thinking you can see and behold Etna and the foreground both at once. Never. One or the other. Foreground and a transcribed Etna. Or Etna, pedestal of heaven.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Optical queues, usually {{constructed}} by optical Switches and fiber Delay Lines (SDL), {{are the key}} elements for conflict resolution in optical packet switching. It is recently shown in [3] that several optical queues {{constructed by}} SDL elements are indeed infinite dimensional switches in time {{and they can be}} constructed by many classical constructions in the switching theory. In particular, a (unicast) <b>flexible</b> delay <b>line</b> in [3] is a discrete-time infinite-server queue that corresponds to the nonblocking switch in the switching theory, and it can be constructed either by the three-stage Clos network or the Cantor network. In this paper, we propose two new constructions for multicast <b>flexible</b> delay <b>lines</b> that use the unicast <b>flexible</b> delay <b>lines</b> as the basic construction elements. The first one is constructed by using parallel unicast <b>flexible</b> delay <b>lines.</b> It is shown that a multicast <b>flexible</b> delay <b>line</b> with maximum delay d can be constructed by using O (√ d) unicast <b>flexible</b> delay <b>lines</b> with maximum delay d. Our second construction is a recursive construction. We show that a multicast <b>flexible</b> delay <b>line</b> with maximum delay 2 d− 1 can be constructed by two unicast <b>flexible</b> delay <b>lines</b> with maximum delay d − 1 and a multicast <b>flexible</b> delay <b>line</b> with maximum delay d− 1. As an application, we show that multicast <b>flexible</b> delay <b>lines</b> can be used for the constructions of optical multicast switches with 100 % throughput. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze a new {{transportation}} system where several transit lines {{of different kinds}} are operated in an integrated environment; here, traditional fixed lines, with regular timetable and fixed itinerary, interact with <b>flexible</b> <b>lines</b> providing demand responsive service. The feature of this system is to provide, by way of integration, an almost personalized transportation service {{at the cost of}} a traditional transportation system; such a system is particularly fitting for medium/low demand transportation settings, and it represents a solution toward a sustainable mobility in urban and sub-urban areas. Moreover, this system is perfectly suited for feeding high swift, high capacity main lines, such as light tramways or underground, thus providing a suitable connection to the regular transit system to users located in low demand areas. According to the recent review by Gendreau and Potvin (1998), {{there is a lack of}} both literature and models in this field. The system here proposed is designed as follows. Let us consider a set bearer swift lines, such as underground or light surface rail, and a set of <b>flexible</b> <b>lines,</b> possibly acting as feeders of the previous ones. The traversal of any line can be described, as usually, in terms of a list of time-tabled trips.

Analogous to their counterparts in switching theory, there exist multistage constructions for these three types of queues. Specifically, we develop a two-stage construction of a linear compressor and a three-stage construction of a non-overtaking delay line. Similarly, there is a three-stage construction of a <b>flexible</b> delay <b>line.</b> Moreover, a <b>flexible</b> delay <b>line</b> can also be constructed by a layered Cantor network. I...|$|R
