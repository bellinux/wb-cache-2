50|$|In the United Kingdom, CEMEX was {{originally}} fined £400,000 on October 2006 after hazardous dust was deposited {{up to three}} miles (5 km) away from its Rugby works. The fine was the highest ever given under the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control regulations, and was also the highest for an Environment Agency prosecution for six years. The fine was, however, judged excessive by the Court of Appeal and so reduced to £50,000. In April 2007, CEMEX announced that it had installed a £6.5 million <b>dust</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>system</b> at the same works in Rugby, which had cut particulate emissions by 80%. The site comes {{under the auspices of}} the EU Waste Incineration Directive as it burns waste tyres for fuel. There are concerns over the impact on both the environment and human health from this practice, although it is common practice in many cement works.|$|E

We ask this question in the context of <b>dust</b> <b>abatement,</b> where the asset is air quality.

We show that the optimal point for the company lies in between the textbook cases of so-called private optimum and social optimum, which constitute, respectively, a lower and an upper bound for <b>dust</b> <b>abatement.</b> We calculate the upper bound and provide elements for the calculation of the lower bound.

The summary of this paper is that it is economical to convert from the existing abatement (iron/caustic/peroxide) to the alternative (surface condenser/Stretford) by a substantial amount. There is also a most economical timing sequence to accomplish the conversion to the surface condenser/Stretford abatement. The project if started immediately would be finished and operating by 1984.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems affecting geothermal fields is the abatement of hydrogen chloride contained in the vapor phase. If the chloride concentration exceeds a few ppmw, steam scrubbing must be provided in order to prevent corrosion of the gathering system and turbine failure. In some fields at Larderello, one {{of the most}} important geothermal areas in Italy, steam scrubbing is performed by injecting a caustic solution directly into the steam pipeline. In particular, the <b>abatement</b> <b>system</b> depends on absorption with chemical reaction of hydrogen chloride by a sodium hydroxide solution.

Finally, some simplified models for computing abatement efficiency in sprays, pipelines, static mixers, cyclones and vane type demisters—the equipment generally used in these plants—are proposed.

40|$|The {{challenge}} facing South African foundries today are {{compliance with the}} environmental legislations while maintaining a high production rate. The focus {{of this study is}} to assist foundries to comply with National Environment Management Air Quality Act 39 of 2004. The aim of the study is to achieve a foundry with high production rate with low energy consumption and low emissions, while complying with air quality legislation. Data was collected from foundries within the Cities of Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg. Foundries were requested to provide information such as the raw materials feed rate, and production rate, emission units, type of energy used and consumption rates. Seventeen foundries participated in this study. Data collected from these foundries assisted in determining the emissions rate generated during production process. Emissions were quantified from the foundries using emission factors. In this study electricity and natural gas were found to be the most preferred source of energy in the foundries. An energy intensity relationship exists, for both electricity and natural gas and its production rate. The results indicated efficiency of energy intensity of 0. 25 to 6. 37 GJ/Tonne in the foundries. Selection of furnace used by the facilities plays an important role on the energy saving and emission reduction. Foundries that need to reduce particulate matters on the melting should consider electric arc furnace because it generate less particulate matters than open hearth. Foundries that would like to reduce sulphur dioxide should consider electric arc furnace rather than open hearth. Foundries that have challenges on the NOx should consider open hearth furnace than electric arc. An installation of suitable <b>abatement</b> <b>systems</b> should also be considered for the reduction of other pollutants. Results indicated that installation of <b>abatement</b> <b>system</b> at 95 % efficiency will decrease emission rates by twenty times.

40|$|The freeze-thaw/evaporation (FTE{reg_sign}) process treats {{oil and gas}} {{produced}} water so that the water can be beneficially used. The FTE{reg_sign} process is the coupling of evaporation and freeze-crystallization, and in climates where subfreezing temperatures seasonally occur, this coupling improves process economics compared to evaporation alone. An added benefit of the process is that water of a quality suited {{for a variety of}} beneficial uses is produced. The evolution, from concept to successful commercial deployment, of the FTE{reg_sign} process for the treatment of natural gas {{produced water}} has now been completed. In this document, the histories of two individual commercial deployments of the FTE{reg_sign} process are discussed. In Wyoming, as in many other states, the permitting and regulation of oil and gas produced water disposal and/or treatment facilities depend upon the legal relationship between owners of the facility and the owners of wells from which the water is produced. An ''owner-operated'' facility is regulated by the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (WOGCC) and is defined as an entity which only processes water which comes from the wells in fields of which they have an equity interest. However, if a facility processes water from wells in which the owners of the facility have no equity interest, the facility is considered a ''commercial'' facility and is permitted and regulated by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality. For this reason, of the two commercial FTE{reg_sign} process deployments discussed in this document, one is related to an ''owner-operated'' facility, and the other relates to a ''commercial'' facility. Case 1 summarizes the permitting, design, construction, operation, and performance of the FTE{reg_sign} process at an ''owner-operated'' facility located in the Jonah Field of southwestern Wyoming. This facility was originally owned by the McMurry Oil Company and was later purchased by the Alberta Energy Company (now EnCana). Case 2 summarizes the permitting, design, construction, operation, and performance at a ''commercial'' FTE{reg_sign} facility located in the Great Divide Basin of south central Wyoming. Permits required for the construction and operation of each facility are described in detail. The respective qualities of each feed water, treated water, and concentrate stream are presented along with the relative yields of treated water and concentrate at each facility. Treated water from the owner-operated facility has been beneficially used in drilling and <b>dust</b> <b>abatement,</b> and treated water from the commercial facility has been used for <b>dust</b> <b>abatement,</b> construction, and land application. The permitting requirements and evaluation of beneficial use of the water at each facility are discussed. The results of this research confirm that the FTE{reg_sign} process is economic at a commercial-scale for the treatment and disposal of natural gas produced water in Wyoming. Further, the treated water produced from the process is of a quality suitable for beneficial uses such as irrigation, drilling mix, wildlife or livestock watering, and/or <b>dust</b> <b>abatement</b> on local roads...|$|R
