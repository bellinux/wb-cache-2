5|$|It {{was common}} {{practice}} for ore freighters, even in foul weather, to embark with not all cargo clamps locked {{in place on}} the <b>hatch</b> <b>covers.</b> Maritime author Wolff reported that depending on weather conditions, all the clamps were eventually set within one to two days. Captain Paquette of Wilfred Sykes was dismissive of suggestions that unlocked hatch clamps caused Fitzgerald to founder. He said that he commonly sailed in fine weather using the minimum number of clamps necessary to secure the <b>hatch</b> <b>covers.</b>|$|E

5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{hydraulic}} <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> {{is used to}} seal rainwater and {{to carry}} container and weather loads. The method of optimization theory based on dual method has been transplanted to optimize <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> structure in the present paper, and the numerical calculation model of <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> structure was established. The target function is the structure gravity of <b>hatch</b> <b>cover,</b> there are three kinds of constraints: yielding strength, rigidity and buckling strength. The hydraulic <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> has been optimized under multiple loads, the numerical calculation results meet the design requirements...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: According to the {{increase}} of the operating cost and material cost of a ship due to the change of international oil price, a demand for the lightening of the ship weight is being made from various parties such as shipping companies, ship owners, and shipyards. To satisfy such demand, many studies for a light ship are being made. As one of them, an optimal design method of an existing hull structure, that is, a method for lightening the ship weight based on the optimization technique was proposed in this study. For this, we selected a <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> of a bulk carrier as an optimization target and formulated an optimization problem {{in order to determine}} optimal principal dimensions of the <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> for lightening the bulk carrier. Some dimensions representing the shape of the <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> were selected as design variables and some design considerations related to the maximum stress, maximum deflection, and geometry of the <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> were selected as constraints. In addition, the minimization of the weight of the <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> was selected as an objective function. To solve this optimization problem, we developed an optimization program based on the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) using C++ programming language. To evaluate the applicability of the developed program, it was applied to a problem for finding optimal principal dimensions of the <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> of a deadweight 180, 000 ton bulk carrier. The result shows that the developed program can decrease the <b>hatch</b> <b>cover's</b> weight by about 8. 5 %. Thus, this study will be able to contribute to make energy saving and environment-friendly ship in shipyard...|$|R
25|$|The bridge {{initiating}} {{equipment is}} controlled by a system of hydraulic cylinders; the allocation of hydraulic oil can be controlled both manually by mechanical levers and automatically. The pressure of the liquid is provided by high-pressure piston pumps motorized by the tank engine. All mechanisms of the MT-55A used for laying and recovering the bridge can be controlled by the crew from inside the tank with the <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> closed.|$|E
25|$|For a BBC Radio 4 documentary, Tom Mangold had {{an expert}} from Lloyds {{investigate}} {{the loss of}} Cyclops. The expert noted that manganese ore, being much denser than coal, had room to move within the holds even when fully laden, the <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> were canvas and that when wet the ore can become a slurry. As such, the load could shift and cause the ship to list. Combined with a possible loss of power from its one engine it could founder in bad weather.|$|E
25|$|Loading a {{submarine}} was a lengthy process that took weeks. The {{first step was}} to pump the forward ballast tanks empty which elevated the bow out of the water. Once it was dismantled, the ballast tanks were then filled to lower the bow and flood the well deck to allow the submarine to be winched aboard. The well deck's water-tight doors were then closed and the water in the dock was pumped overboard while the submarine settled onto its wooden bilge blocks. The bow was then reassembled and <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> were installed over the well deck. These prevented the ship from taking on water during a storm and allowed the crew to perform any necessary maintenance on the submarine while under way.|$|E

25|$|Some {{modifications}} {{were made}} to cargo spaces and cargo handling equipment. The aftmost lower hold {{was turned into a}} refrigerated cargo space and a dividing bulkhead was removed from the foremost hold. The tweendeck <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> were changed from wire-operated to hydraulic and, due to the rearranging of the aft deck winches and to ease the handling of mooring lines, the aft hatch was made slightly smaller than in the original ships. The capacity of the deck crane in front of the superstructure was increased to 40 tons to allow better handling of ore containers. The stern quarter ramp was also changed to a folding type that would maintain constant pressure on the quay. There were also some changes to the general arrangements of the lowest accommodation deck.|$|E
25|$|On September 1, 1905, Sevona left Allouez, Wisconsin, {{bound for}} Erie, Pennsylvania, with a cargo of iron ore and {{a crew of}} twenty men and four women. Later that night, an {{unexpected}} storm hit the area. By midnight, the wind had reached gale-force strength. At around 6:00 a.m. on September 2, Sevona ran aground on a shoal and broke in half. No other vessel was {{in the area to}} aid Sevona, so crew members on the stern section of the ship boarded the lifeboats. Crew members on the bow section, separated from the lifeboats, were forced to construct a raft out of <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> and doors. All crew members on the makeshift raft later lost their lives in the storm. Three other vessels, including the schooner-barge Pretoria, were lost in the storm.|$|E
25|$|The ships {{have five}} holds fitted with tweendecks, four {{forwards}} and one abaft of the superstructure, {{with a total}} grain capacity of 31,181 cubic metres. The foremost hold, No. 1, is specially designed for the carriage of explosives for the mining industry, inflammable liquids and chemicals in packages, {{and for this reason}} has a separate seawater fire extinguishing system that {{can also be used to}} cool the bulkhead between the foremost holds. Lower holds No. 2, 3 and 4 are designed for bulk cargoes such as coal, ore and grain. Containers can be carried in all holds and on the <b>hatch</b> <b>covers,</b> and the total container capacity of the SA-15 class ships is 576 twenty-foot equivalent units, forty of which can be refrigerated, or 236 forty-foot equivalent units. In addition the ships can carry special ten-foot ore concentrate containers in holds No. 2, 3 and 4, with two layers on tank top and one on tweendeck.|$|E

500|$|Regulations {{regarding}} <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> {{have evolved}} since the investigation following {{the loss of}} the [...] The Load Line Conference of 1966 imposed a requirement that <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> be able to withstand load of 1.74tons/m2 due to sea water, and a minimum scantling of 6mm for the tops of the <b>hatch</b> <b>covers.</b> The International Association of Classification Societies then increased this strength standard by creating its Unified Requirement S21 in 1998. [...] This standard requires that the pressure due to sea water be calculated as a function of freeboard and speed, especially for <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> located on the forward portion of the ship.|$|E
500|$|As {{recently}} as the 1950s, hatches had wooden covers that would be broken apart and rebuilt by hand, rather than opened and closed. [...] Newer vessels have hydraulic-operated metal <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> that can often be operated by one person. [...] <b>Hatch</b> <b>covers</b> can slide forwards, backwards, or to the side, lift up or fold up. It is essential that the <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> be watertight: unsealed hatches lead to accidental cargo hold flooding, which has caused many bulkers to sink.|$|E
500|$|The NTSB {{conducted}} computer studies, {{testing and}} analysis {{to determine the}} forces necessary to collapse the <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> and concluded that Fitzgerald sank suddenly from flooding of the cargo hold [...] "due {{to the collapse of}} {{one or more of the}} <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> under the weight of giant boarding seas" [...] instead of flooding gradually due to ineffective hatch closures. The NTSB dissenting opinion held that Fitzgerald sank suddenly and unexpectedly from shoaling.|$|E
