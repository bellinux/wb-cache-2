5000|$|The western {{marsh harrier}} (Circus aeruginosus) {{is a large}} harrier, a bird of prey from {{temperate}} and subtropical western Eurasia and adjacent Africa. It {{is also known as}} the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier.</b> The genus name Circus is derived from the Ancient Greek kirkos, referring to a bird of prey named for its circling flight (kirkos, [...] "circle"), probably the hen harrier.

40|$|Breeding {{behaviour}} of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers</b> Circus aeruginosus pairs nesting in marshes, {{water reservoir}} and fish pond of SE Poland were compared. Harriers nesting on the marshes were most efficient during aerial prey transfers, which could {{suggest that the}} habitat was taken by experienced, better quality birds when set against the ones occupying nests on the ponds and reservoir. Additional evidence that higher quality birds nested on marshes is that egg laying was earlier there. <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harriers</b> performed U-shape undulation, in the nestling period and these appeared more intense for marsh nesters as well...|$|R
5000|$|Like {{the other}} <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers,</b> it is {{strongly}} associated with wetland areas, especially those rich in common reed (Phragmites australis). It can also be met with {{in a variety of}} other open habitats, such as farmland and grassland, particularly where these border marshland. It is a territorial bird in the breeding season, and even in winter it seems less social than other harriers, which often gather in large flocks. But this is probably simply due to habitat preferences, as the <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers</b> are completely allopatric while several of C. aeruginosus grassland and steppe relatives winter in the same regions and assemble at food sources such as locust outbreaks. Still, in Keoladeo National Park of Rajasthan (India) around 100 <b>Eurasian</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers</b> are observed to roost together each November/December; they assemble in tall grassland dominated by Desmostachya bipinnata and vetiver (Chrysopogon zizanioides), but where this is too disturbed by human activity they will use floating carpets of common water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) instead - the choice of such roost sites may be to give early warning of predators, which will conspicuously rustle through the plants if they try to sneak upon the resting birds ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we discuss the {{seasonal}} dynamics and population density of Birds of Prey at the Nizhniy Novgorod International airport “Strigino”, based on data collected from November, 2013 to November, 2014. During this period a total of 71 raptors of 9 species were observed, including one breeding species – the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harrier</b> (Circus aeruginosus). The seasonal population dynamics and species composition of Birds of Prey on {{the territory of the}} airport was studied. The highest population density and species number occurred during end of June – July, in September and in April. The summer population peak was caused by regular observations of hunting birds, whose nests were located on the territory of the airport and in the close vicinity. Young birds also made a contribution to this peak. Autumn and spring population peaks were caused by more frequent observations of migrating raptors during the seasonal migrations. The lowest number of raptors in the airport was observed in winter...|$|E
40|$|Within animal {{communities}} {{the loss}} of a single keystone species can lead to substantial change, or in extreme cases, community collapse. This phenomenon has been documented in different communities and habitats but has not been widely investigated in bird communities. We studied the long-term dynamics of breeding birds in a medium-sized hemiboreal lake that is situated within a large primary forest-mire-lake ecosystem in central-east of Estonia. The aim of this 25 year study was to determine whether the black-headed gull, Larus ridibundus, acts as a keystone species in the bird community and what was the effect of {{the loss of}} this species. Results revealed large changes in the bird community similar to those that would occur in a fragile system in response to keystone species loss, confirming our theory. Mallard Anas platyrhynchos, common pochard Aythya ferina, tufted duck Aythya fuligula, great crested grebe Podiceps cristatus, red-necked grebe Podiceps grisegena, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier</b> Circus aeruginosus, spotted crake Porzana porzana, coot Fulica atra, and common tern Sterna hirundo were most closely related to the abundance of black-headed gull. During the study period there was little change in habitat quality or extent. It is unclear as to the causes of the gull colony collapse; however, landscape-level changes in feeding areas and agricultural land could be a reason. We conclude that further study of keystone species and fragile communities in different habitats and ecosystems is important to ascertain which species and communities {{are most likely to be}} affected in the event of {{the loss of a}} keystone bird species...|$|E
40|$|The {{floodplains}} of the West-African Sahel {{region have}} experienced extensive habitat transformation {{during the past}} four decades, coinciding with an impoverishment of raptor populations. We investigated foraging patterns of Palaearctic migratory <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harriers</b> Circus aeruginosus, Pallid Harriers C. macrourus and Montagu’s Harriers C. pygargus on a floodplain system in northern Cameroon to assess species, sex- and age-related habitat preferences. Sex and age have rarely been incorporated into general studies of raptor habitat associations, despite clear evidence of intrasexual and age-related differences in foraging strategies and diet composition, potentially carrying strong conservation implications. We found evidence of sexual differences in foraging preference related to land use, particularly in the most sexually dimorphic Pallid Harrier, and evidence that juveniles used different habitats to adults. This constitutes the first quantitative documentation of such differentiation by Palaearctic raptors on African wintering grounds, indicating that general patterns of habitat use in wintering raptors may obscure sex- and age-specific preferences. Contrary to expectations, we found limited evidence for interspecific foraging segregation. Food partitioning by prey mass was related to harrier body mass and facilitated by a diverse availability of prey on human-transformed floodplains. Anticipated further large-scale conversion of floodplain habitat into predominantly desiccated grasslands raises concerns about the survival of wintering harriers. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harrier</b> Circus aeruginosus {{population}} has expanded rapidly {{during the last}} decades in northern Finland. We studied the diet of <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harrier</b> during the breeding seasons 2002 – 2009 on the isle of Hailuoto in the Gulf of Bothnia in Finland. We com-pared these results {{to those of other}} raptors in the region, and attempted to relate potential differences in the diet composition to population trends. Birds accounted for 73 – 93 % of prey numbers in the <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harrier</b> during the breeding season. Passerine birds were the most numerous during the nestling (63 %) and fledging periods (21 %), while ducks and gulls/terns had the highest biomass (29 % and 12 %, respectively). Muskrat (Ondatra zibethica) was the most important prey among mammals by number and weight (15 % and 18 %, respectively). Compositional analysis showed that the <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harrier</b> depredated water and shore birds opportunistically. Based on multidimensional scaling, the food niche of the <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harrier</b> was distinctive from those of five other raptor species.

40|$|As the {{evolutionary}} responses to environmental change depend on selection acting on individual differences, disentangling within- and between-individual variation becomes imperative. In animal migration research, multiyear tracks are thus needed {{to estimate the}} individual consistency of phenotypic traits.

Here, we compare repeatability patterns of routes and timing between two migratory birds, the <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier,</b> Circus aeruginosus, and the osprey, Pandion haliaetus, as recorded by satellite tracking. We found interspecific contrasts with low repeatability in timing and duration and a high repeatability in routes for ospreys, but the reverse pattern for <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers.</b> This was mainly caused by (1) larger between-individual variation in routes for ospreys (broad-front migration) than for <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers</b> (corridor migration) and {{a higher degree of}} repeated use of the same stopover sites among ospreys, and (2) higher within-individual consistency of timing and duration among <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers,</b> while individual ospreys were more flexible.

40|$|We {{used the}} doubly labeled water (DLW) method to measure daily energy {{expenditure}} (DEE) in eight brother-sister pairs of free-living <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harrier</b> (Circus aeruginosus) nestlings.

Because the average sex ratio at fledging in <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harriers</b> is 55 % male, and the energy requirement of sons is 45 % of the son-daughter pair, this sex ratio matches exactly that predicted by Fisher's theory (1930).
