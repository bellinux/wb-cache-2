40|$|Plasma IGF- 1 {{concentrations}} were measured in 28 multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows at start-of-mating date in two consecutive lactations. The {{study was conducted}} in the Northern Irrigation Region of Victoria. Cows grazed pasture at an allowance of 35 kg dry matter/cow/day and received either 1 kg or 6 kg <b>grain</b> supplement in <b>Year</b> 1, and 6 kg <b>grain</b> supplement in <b>Year</b> 2. Plasma IGF- 1 concentration was significantly lower in Year 1 compared to Year 2, partly due to the higher average <b>grain</b> intake in <b>Year</b> 2. There was a significant positive correlation in plasma IGF- 1 concentrations between the two years for each cow (Pearson’s correlation coefficient 0. 65, Spearman’s correlation coefficient 0. 59; P< 0. 001). This means that comparative ranking for plasma IGF- 1 concentration was similar between the same cows in two consecutive lactations, so that, regardless of diet, cows with relatively hig...|$|R

30|$|Appearance of chalky <b>grains</b> of both <b>years</b> {{showed some}} resemblance, and the {{high-temperature}} stress of 2010 remarkably extended the chalking of grain. Scanning electron microscopic observation showed that round-shaped starch granules with numerous small pits were loosely packed in the opaque {{part of the}} chalky grains. Proteomic analyzes of rice chalky grains revealed deregulations in the expression of multiple proteins implicated in diverse metabolic and physiological functions, such as protein synthesis, redox homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and starch biosynthesis and degradation. The glycomic profiling has shown slight differences in chain-length distributions of starches in the grains of 2009 -to- 2010. However, no significant changes were observed in the chain-length distributions between the translucent and opaque parts of perfect and chalky <b>grains</b> in both <b>years.</b> The glucose and soluble starch contents in opaque parts were increased by the high-temperature stress of 2010, though those in perfect grains were not different regardless of the environmental changes of 2009 -to- 2010.|$|R
