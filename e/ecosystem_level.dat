2500|$|Biodiversity, a {{portmanteau}} of [...] "bio" [...] (life) and [...] "diversity", generally {{refers to}} the [...] and variability of life on Earth.

2500|$|The {{metabolic}} {{theory of}} ecologyâ€™s main {{implication is that}} metabolic rate, {{and the influence of}} body size and temperature on metabolic rate, provide the fundamental constraints by which ecological processes are governed. [...] If this holds true from the level of the individual up to <b>ecosystem</b> <b>level</b> processes, then life history attributes, population dynamics, and ecosystem processes could be explained by the relationship between metabolic rate, body size, and body temperature. While different underlying mechanisms make somewhat different predictions, the following provides an example of some of the implications of the metabolism of individuals.|$|E
2500|$|A multispecies {{approach}} to conservation {{is important because}} of {{the increasing number of}} native species becoming threatened and endangered in the San Joaquin Valley. [...] Management on an <b>ecosystem</b> <b>level</b> would allow the role of all the species to be taken into account. [...] Also, an increase in awareness and education of the public around the Valley may further help increase funding for conservation and management plans. [...] Monitoring and studying of the species is needed to determine just how threatened the species is and {{what needs to be done}} to reestablish stable populations in the valley.|$|E
2500|$|Topological ecology at the {{landscape}} level of biological organisation (e.g. Urban et al.): [...] On {{the basis of}} ecological hierarchy theory, it is presupposed that nature is working at multiple scales and has different levels of organisation which {{are part of a}} rate-structured, nested hierarchy. Specifically, it is claimed that, above the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>level,</b> a landscape level exists which is generated and identifiable by high interaction intensity between ecosystems, a specific interaction frequency and, typically, a corresponding spatial scale. Landscape ecology is defined as ecology that focuses on the influence exerted by spatial and temporal patterns on the organisation of, and interaction among, functionally integrated multispecies ecosystems.|$|E
50|$|Environmental toxicology, {{also known}} as ecotox, is a {{multidisciplinary}} field of science concerned with {{the study of the}} harmful effects of various chemical, biological and physical agents on living organisms.

30|$|Important {{to notice}} that, {{even if the}} {{maturity}} levels are numbered in a linear scale, {{it is easy to}} see that the dimensions grow in an exponential manner.

50|$|Genetic {{diversity}} {{is needed to}} maintain the vitality of forests and to provide resilience to pests and diseases.

2500|$|At the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>level,</b> MTE {{explains}} {{the relationship between}} temperature and production of total biomass. [...] The average production to biomass ratio of organisms is higher in small organisms than large ones. [...] This relationship is further regulated by temperature, {{and the rate of}} production increases with temperature. [...] As production consistently scales with body mass, MTE provides a framework to assess the relative importance of organismal size, temperature, functional traits, soil and climate on variation in rates of production within and across ecosystems. [...] Metabolic theory shows that variation in ecosystem production is characterized by a common scaling relationship, suggesting that global change models can incorporate the mechanisms governing this relationship to improve predictions of future ecosystem function.|$|E

30|$|While the institutionally {{oriented}} ecosystem {{model on}} UBC (Davey et al. 2013 a) emphasizes {{its contribution to}} knowledge society and identifies the general <b>ecosystem</b> <b>levels,</b> an organization-cultural, practice-centric, and socially grounded approach is left rather open.

30|$|Focusing on feeding as an {{endpoint}} in {{ecotoxicological studies}} {{is a useful}} and sensitive tool to detect sub-lethal impacts on individual organisms with relevance {{to higher levels of}} organisation (i.e. population and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>levels).</b> We conducted a series of experiments to identify and quantify the influence of parasite infection and food source, food quality, body size and acclimation time prior to testing on the feeding rate of individual Gammarus pulex. Our aim was to assess the variability in feeding rate associated with these factors to support design of feeding assays with individual organisms at a daily resolution.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that for assessment studies, divisions into a core region (ecoseries), an im- mediate surrounding (ecosecction) and a wider surrounding (ecodistrict) {{should be used}} in eco- system classification. A methodology to classify sites was set up and, making use of ten sites for biological evaluation in Belgium, it was shown how a hierarchical ecosystem classification could improve categorisation. Often the visual characteristics of the surrounding landscape, such as diversity or connectivity, mask the fea- tures ofthe core zone itself(ecoseries). Using different hierarchic <b>ecosystem</b> <b>levels</b> is a direct and effective help to avoid this masking and to give more importance to existing nuances...|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{variation}} {{within and}} among key species can have significant ecological consequences at the population, community, and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>levels.</b> In {{order to understand}} ecological properties of systems based on habitat-forming clonal plants, {{it is crucial to}} clarify which traits vary among plant genotypes and how they influence ecological processes, and to assess their relative contribution to ecosystem functioning in comparison to other factors. Here we used a mesocosm experiment to examine the relative influence of genotypic identity and extreme levels of nitrogen loading on traits that affect ecological processes (at the population, community, and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>levels)</b> for Zostera marina, a widespread marine angiosperm that forms monospecific meadows throughout coastal areas in the Northern Hemisphere. We found effects of both genotype and nitrogen addition on many plant characteristics (e. g., aboveground and belowground biomass), and these were generally strong and similar in magnitude, whereas interactive effects were rare. Genotypes also strongly differed in susceptibility to herbivorous isopods, with isopod preference among genotypes generally matching their performance in terms of growth and survival. Chemical rather than structural differences among genotypes drove these differences in seagrass palatability. Nitrogen addition uniformly decreased plant palatability but did not greatly alter the relative preferences of herbivores among genotypes, indicating that genotype effects are strong. Our results highlight that differences in key traits among genotypes of habitat-forming species can have important consequences for the communities and ecosystems that depend on them and that such effects are not overwhelmed by known environmental stressors.
