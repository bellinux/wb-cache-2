50|$|On July 1, 2015, Wolf vetoed {{a budget}} {{submitted}} {{to him by}} the Republican-controlled Pennsylvania General Assembly, ensuring a budget dispute between the governor's office and the legislature during Wolf's first year in office. This marked the first time a Pennsylvania Governor vetoed a budget bill in its entirety since Milton Shapp did so in 1976. Wolf argued the budget was not balanced, disputing a claim by Republicans that the budget would provide increased funding in certain areas without raising taxes. A point of dispute in the budget process was the proposed privatization of Pennsylvania's wine and liquor sales, which Wolf opposes. The state operated without a <b>full</b> <b>budget</b> for 267 days—the longest period without a <b>full</b> <b>budget</b> in Pennsylvania history-until the 2015-16 budget became law without Wolf's signature in March 2016.|$|R

The main point of his budget was the introduction of a Selective Employment Tax, penalising the service industry and favouring the manufacturing industry. Twelve days after the budget, the National Union of Seamen called a national strike and the problems facing Sterling were multiplied. Additional strikes caused the balance of payments deficit to increase and the 3.3billion loan was now due.

After the warning by its private partners, the foundation released half of the due payments to partner schools across the province. However, the schools say only 50% of the money does not cover their expenses as they have to pay teachers and cover other costs.|$|R

The second part of the same section discusses alternative assumptions, aiming to provide sensitivity analyses for the baseline scenario. Results of both the baseline scenario and sensitivity analyses are presented in Section 5.
