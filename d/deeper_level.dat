25|$|In 1955, Ganpal Lal Batto died {{suddenly}} in a road accident. His death left Shamshad very distraught, {{because her husband}} had been the focus of her life and they had both been extremely devoted to each other. He had handled many aspects of her career and contracts and had been a major positive energy behind her career progression. After his death, Shamshad became listless and lost the fighting spirit to pursue her career, which registered a sharp decline thereafter. Indeed, while Shamshad Begum was both an outstanding singer and a successful famous one, she was at some <b>deeper</b> <b>level</b> always a wife and mother first, someone who instinctively prioritised her family over her career. By nature, she preferred to keep away from the public glare and from business dealings, taking the view that it was rather unseemly for a lady to be involved in such things. After her husband's death, Shamshad Begum began living with her daughter and son-in-law in Mumbai, first in south Mumbai and later at Hiranandani Gardens in the Powai neighbourhood. She gradually became a recluse and devoted herself entirely to her grandchildren, {{to the point that the}} general public was unaware of whether she was alive or dead. In 2004, a controversy erupted in the media, when several publications wrongly reported that Shamshad Begum had died a few years previously. Shamshad's family clarified in a press release that this was not so; and it later emerged that the Shamshad Begum who had died in 1998 was Saira Banu's maternal grandmother. Her self-imposed seclusion is remarkable, because during all those decades away from the public eye, her old songs remained popular with the public and not a day passed without at least a couple of songs being played on Vividh Bharati and All India Radio.|$|E
25|$|The only {{three-dimensional}} {{depiction of}} Khufu that has survived time nearly completely {{is a small}} and well restored ivory figurine known as Khufu Statuette. It shows the king with the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. The king is seated on a throne with a short backrest, at {{the left side of}} his knees the Horus-name Medjedu is preserved, and, at the right side, the very scarce rest of the lower part of the cartouche name Khnum-Khuf is visible. Khufu holds a flail in his left hand, and his right hand rests together with the lower arm on his right upper leg. The artifact was found in 1903 by Flinders Petrie at Kom el-Sultan near Abydos. The figurine was found headless; according to Petrie, it was caused by an accident while digging. When Petrie recognized the importance of the find, he stopped all other work and offered a reward to any workman who could find the head. Three weeks later the head was found after intense sifting in a <b>deeper</b> <b>level</b> of the room rubble. Today the little statue is restored and on display in the Egyptian Museum of Cairo in room 32 under its inventory number JE 36143. Most Egyptologists believe the statuette is contemporary, but some scholars, such as Zahi Hawass, think that it was an artistic reproduction of the 26th dynasty. He argues that no building that surely dates to the 4th dynasty was ever excavated at Kom el-Sultan or Abydos. Furthermore, he points out that the face of Khufu is unusually squat and chubby and shows no emotional expression. Hawass compared the facial stylistics with statues of contemporary kings, such as Sneferu, Khaefra and Menkaura. The faces of these three kings are of even beauty, slender and with a kindly expression – the clear result of idealistic motivations; they are not based on reality. The appearance of Khufu on the ivory statue instead looks like the artist did not care very much about professionalism or diligence. And Khufu himself would have never allowed the display of such a comparatively sloppy work. And finally, Hawass also argues that the sort of throne the figurine sits on does not match the artistic styles of any Old Kingdom artifact. Old Kingdom thrones had a backrest that reached up to the neck of a king. But the ultimate proof that convinces Hawass about the statue being a reproduction of much later time is the Nehenekh-flail in Khufu's left hand. Depictions of a king with such a flail as a ceremonial insignia appear no earlier than during the Middle Kingdom. Zahi Hawass therefore concludes that the figurine was possibly made as an amulet or lucky charm to sell to pious citizens.|$|E

A broad band of <b>deep</b> <b>levels</b> {{is found to be}} associated with Rh impurity in n-type GaAs in the upper half bandgap. The band of electron emitting <b>deep</b> <b>levels</b> is shown to extend from 0. 57 - 0. 67 eV below the conduction band edge. The observed variation of the peak profile with the capture time for the electron emission band support a band-like-extended-defect nature of this <b>deep</b> <b>level</b> band. In p-type GaAs:Rh, a composite peak consisting of emission signals from at least two <b>deep</b> <b>levels</b> in the lower half bandgap is identified with Rh. This peak is resolved using double-correlation DL TS. (DDL TS) measurements, providing the clear energy positions of the Rh-related <b>deep</b> <b>levels</b> as E,. + 0. 35 eV (RhA) and E,. + 0. 51 eV (RhB). Detailed study of the various deep-levels characteristics has been carried out for all the Rh-related levels. All of these are found to exhibit electric field dependent them 1. al emission rates for the respective charge carriers. Detailed experimental data have been obtained on this field dependence wherever possible and theoretical analysis of these data has been carried out in the light of available models to obtain physical insight into the nature of respective <b>deep</b> <b>levels.</b> DLTS investigations on Ru transition-metal impurity in MOCYD grown GaAs shows a prominent <b>deep</b> <b>level</b> at Ec - 0. 39 eV (Ru 1 E) associated with ruthenium in n-GaAs. In p-type samples, three <b>deep</b> <b>levels</b> are identified with Ru impurity in the lower-half bandgap of GaAs with energy positions E,. -+- 0. 38 eV (RuA), E,. + 0. 52 eV (RuB) and E,. + 0. 65 eV (RuC). RuC is found to have an electric field dependent emission rate signature. In minority carrier emission spectra of p-type GaAs: Ru, a broad peak is observed in Ru doped samples with the peak position corresponding to a deep-level at Ec - 0. 66 eV (Ru 1). Measurements with varied minority carrier injection conditions indicate that this electron emission DLTS signal probably arises from a band of <b>deep</b> <b>levels,</b> rather than a well-defined single-energy <b>deep</b> <b>level.</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>level</b> transient spectroscopy (DLTS) technique has been employed to investigate the electrical characteristics of Os-related <b>deep</b> <b>levels.</b> Two prominent <b>deep</b> <b>levels</b> have been identified with Os at Ec - 0. 28 eV (Osl) and Ec - 0. 41 eV (Os 2) in the upper-half bandgap of GaAs.

While Osl does not allow accurate quantitative investigations of this field dependence due to its relatively low concentration, detailed quantitative data on the field dependence of the level, Os 2, are reported.
