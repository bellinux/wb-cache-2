Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English <b>Faculty</b> <b>Library),</b> and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 15 Nostredame {{entered the}} University of Avignon to study for his baccalaureate. After {{little more than a}} year (when he would have studied the regular trivium of grammar, rhetoric and logic rather than the later quadrivium of geometry, arithmetic, music and astronomy/astrology), he was forced to leave Avignon when the {{university}} closed its doors during an outbreak of the plague. After leaving Avignon, Nostredame, by his own account, traveled the countryside for eight years from 1521 researching herbal remedies. In 1529, after some years as an apothecary, he entered the University of Montpellier to study for a doctorate in medicine. He was expelled shortly afterwards by the student procurator, Guillaume Rondelet, when it was discovered that he had been an apothecary, a [...] "manual trade" [...] expressly banned by the university statutes, and had been slandering doctors. The expulsion document, BIU Montpellier, Register S 2 folio 87, still exists in the <b>faculty</b> <b>library.</b> However, some of his publishers and correspondents would later call him [...] "Doctor". After his expulsion, Nostredame continued working, presumably still as an apothecary, and became famous for creating a [...] "rose pill" [...] that purportedly protected against the plague.|$|E
