50|$|Edmund-Davies LJ did {{not agree}} with the majority, finding that the loss was both direct and {{foreseeable}} consequence of the defendant's negligence and should therefore be recovered.

5000|$|... == Decision of Bombay High Court == High Court in {{this case}} stated that copy under Section 14 of the Copyright Act meant a {{physical}} copy. However, the plaintiffs {{in this case}} made a separate work. This was a material alteration as a completely different. The court looked at the similarities and dissimilarities between the show and the ad by comparing the entire show (87hours) with the 30 second advertisement. The work in question was held to be a [...] "cinematographic film" [...] under the Copyright Act. Any prudent person will not confuse between the two. Further, there was no scope for misrepresentation as the ad was aired on channels different from where Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu thi was aired so there was not effect of the ad {{on the show and}} the likelihood of <b>damage</b> was <b>too</b> <b>remote.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{case may}} be defended on issues of fact, the defender denying {{one or more of}} the {{essential}} requirements of the delict.

5000|$|The {{question}} as to the reasonable foreseeability of the damages cannot, the court held, {{be regarded as the}} single decisive criterion in determining liability. Reasonable foreseeability can indeed be used as a subsidiary test in the application of the flexible criterion, but it cannot displace it. The importance and efficacy of the predominating criterion in resolving questions of legal causality lies in its flexibility. Any attempt to detract from its flexibility should be resisted. Comparisons between {{the facts of the case}} which has to be resolved and the facts of other cases in which a solution has already been found, or which might hypothetically arise, can obviously be useful and of value, and sometimes even decisive, but one should be careful not to attempt to distill fixed or generally applicable rules or principles from the process of comparison. The argument that the plaintiff's claim should [...] "in principle" [...] be rejected was misplaced. There is only one principle: In order to determine whether or not the plaintiff's <b>damages</b> were <b>too</b> <b>remote</b> from the defendant's act to hold the defendant liable, considerations of policy, reasonableness, fairness and justice should be applied to the particular facts of thecase.|$|R
50|$|Rigidity, {{the court}} held in Smit v Abrahams, is {{inconsistent}} with the flexible approach or criterion in South African law, whereby the court considers {{on the basis of}} policy considerations whether there is a sufficiently close connection between act and consequence. That question has to be answered on the basis of policy considerations and the limits of reasonableness, fairness and justice. Reasonable foreseeability cannot be regarded as the single decisive criterion for determining liability, but it can indeed be used as a subsidiary test in the application of the flexible criterion. The flexibility criterion is predominant; any attempt to detract from it should be resisted. Comparisons between {{the facts of the case}} which has to be resolved and the facts of other cases in which a solution has already been found can obviously be useful and of value, and sometimes decisive, but one should be careful not to attempt to distill fixed or generally applicable rules or principles from the process of comparison. There is only one principle, the court found: To determine whether the plaintiff's <b>damages</b> are <b>too</b> <b>remote</b> from the defendant's act to hold the defendant liable therefor, considerations of policy (reasonableness, fairness and justice) should be applied to the particular facts of the case.|$|R
40|$|The Singapore Court of Appeal (the Court of Appeal) has in MFM Restaurants Pte Ltd v Fish 2 ̆ 6 Co Restaurants Pte Ltd {{rejected}} Lord Hoffinann 2 ̆ 7 s {{assumption of}} responsibility test (articulated in The Achilleas) to determine whether <b>damages</b> are <b>too</b> <b>remote</b> in a contractual claim. The Court of Appeal, however, retained {{assumption of responsibility}} as a concept to explain the orthodox test for remoteness as embodied in Hadley v Baxendale. To that extent, it expressly accepted Lord Hoffmann 2 ̆ 7 s approach in The Achilleas {{in so far as}} the concept of assumption of responsibility is already incorporated or embodied in both limbs of the Hadley test. Two questions arise from this decision and form the scope of this comment. First, what is the actual disagreement between the Court of Appeal 2 ̆ 7 s more 2 ̆ 2 orthodox 2 ̆ 2 approach, and Lord Hoffmann 2 ̆ 7 s approach? Secondly [...] depending on the answer to the first question [...] can 2 ̆ 2 assumption of responsibility 2 ̆ 2 as a concept justify the Hadley test without it being the test in fact? If the scope of disagreement between the Court of Appeal and Lord Hoffmann is less than fundamental, and assumption of responsibility as a concept can explain the existing orthodox test without subverting it, then the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal may well give effect to Lord Hoffmann 2 ̆ 7 s approach in The Achilleas in a more practically feasible way...|$|R

50|$|In other words, the court's {{main task}} is to do justice as between these parties in their present situation. For this purpose, a {{weighing}} evaluative process is required, rather than a clear-cut rule of law. For example, in Meah v McCreamer and others (No. 2) (1986) 1 AER 943, the claimant suffered head injuries and brain damage {{as a result of}} the defendant's negligent driving, which led to a personality disorder. Four years later, he sexually assaulted and raped three women. The illegal nature of his conduct was not raised at the civil trial, and the claimant was held entitled to damages to compensate him for being imprisoned following his conviction. In separate proceedings, the three women assaulted obtained a judgment for compensation, so he sought indemnification from the negligent driver and his insurers for the amounts he had been ordered to pay. This was not a claim for his own personal injuries nor direct financial loss, but indirect loss. The three women could not have sued the driver directly because they were not foreseeable and so no duty of care was owed to them. The question was whether a person convicted of a crime was entitled to be indemnified against the consequences of that crime. Woolf J. held that the action would be dismissed on two grounds. First, the <b>damages</b> were <b>too</b> <b>remote</b> to be recoverable and, if such actions were to be allowed, it would leave insurers open to indefinite liability for an indefinite duration. Secondly, as a matter of policy, defendants should not have a right to be indemnified against the consequences of their crimes. In Clunis v Camden and Islington Health Authority (1998) QB 978 the claimant had been discharged from hospital where he had been detained under s3 Mental Health Act 1983. He was to receive aftercare services in the community under s117 Act 1983, but his mental condition deteriorated and, two months later, he fatally stabbed a stranger at a London Underground station. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility and was ordered to be detained in a secure hospital. Subsequently, he brought an action against his local health authority for negligence. The health authority applied to strike out the claim as disclosing no cause of action on two grounds. First, that the claim arose out of the health authority's statutory obligations under s117 Act 1983 and those obligations did not give rise to a common law duty of care. Secondly, that the claim was based on the plaintiff's own criminal act. In the Court of Appeal, the health authority's appeal was allowed on both grounds.|$|R
