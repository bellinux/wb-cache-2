30|$|The {{modified}} hydrodistillation method {{involved a}} magnetic stirrer with hotplate (Spinot, Tarsons Products Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi, India). Here, 50  g crushed seeds of Eruca sativa (Mill.) Thell. var. RTM- 1212 {{were added to}} 1000  ml DW in a <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>flask</b> containing a magnetic stir bar. The flask was attached to a clamp stand and the Clevenger apparatus was attached to it (Fig.  1 b). The mixture was allowed to boil at 100  °C with rotation set at 400  rpm. Later, the temperature was reduced to 60  °C and rotation was kept at 300  rpm for 2  h. The oil and water mixture was collected and processed as described in “Conventional hydrodistillation” section.|$|E
30|$|Freeze dryer (Freeze dry- 3, Labconco, Kentucky, USA) {{was used}} for drying fruit samples to {{constant}} mass. A blender (Super Blender Mill Grater 3, France) was used to homogenize fruit samples. A digestion apparatus consisting of 100  mL round or <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>flask</b> fitted with condenser and a hotplate {{was used for}} decomposing the sample matrix. A flame atomic absorption spectrometer (Buck Scientific Model 210 VGP AAS, East Norwalk, USA) was used for determining the concentrations of metals in fruit, soil and water samples. S 2000 Lightwave Spectrophotometer (Cambrige, UK) equipped with UV/VIS diode array detector {{was used for the}} determination of total ascorbic acid. Inolab pH/ION Level 2 pH meter (WTW, Weilheim, Germany) was used for the measurement of the soil pH. Thermo Orion Conductivity meter Model 145 (Thermo Electron Corporation, Midrand, USA) was used for the measurement of electrical conductivity of soil samples.|$|E

30|$|The same {{design for}} the solar {{reflector}} {{was used as the}} reflector in our previous publication [17]. However, the heating block heat sink was removed. To use the reflector without the aluminum heating block as a heat sink, round <b>bottom</b> <b>flasks</b> were painted black up to approximately half-way up the flask using VHT® Flame Proof paint, which can withstand intermittent temperatures up to 1093 °C (Figures 1 and 2). The round <b>bottom</b> <b>flasks</b> were painted to prevent photochemical side reactions and allow for a more efficient heating process.|$|R
50|$|The {{drying pistol}} {{consists}} of two concentric barrels; the inner is connected to a vacuum source via a trap. The outer barrel is connected at the bottom to a round <b>bottom</b> <b>flask,</b> and a condenser. To operate the drying pistol, a sample is placed within the inner barrel, and the barrel is evacuated. The round <b>bottom</b> <b>flask,</b> filled with an appropriate solvent, is heated to a boil. Hot vapors warm the inner barrel; losses are avoided with the condenser. By choosing the appropriate solvent, the temperature at which the sample is dried can be selected.|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim is {{to recycle}} mercury from dental amalgam scrap using the vacuum {{distillation}} method. Materials and Methods: A total of 150 g of dental amalgam scrap was taken in a round <b>bottom</b> <b>flask</b> and was subjected to vacuum distillation at 398 °C. The vapor of mercury was collected in another round <b>bottom</b> <b>flask.</b> Observation: The procedure is carried out for mercury recovery using vacuum distillation apparatus, and mercury vapor are collected in a round <b>bottom</b> <b>flask,</b> and the silver is recovered using sucrose as reducing agent. Using 150 g of dental amalgam scrap 50 %– 80 % of silver are recovered, and silver has a purity of 70 %– 80 %. However, the total time required in the reduction process ranged between 303 and 600 min. Conclusion: Mercury could be recycled from dental amalgam scrap through vacuum distillation method at 398 °C and its implication of dental amalgam scrap in an Indian perspective...|$|R

30|$|The waste {{glycerol}} layer (15 mL) {{from the}} biodiesel synthesis was made acidic (pH = 3 - 4) by adding conc. HCl. Once acidic, the glycerol/methanol layer was isolated.

40|$|Studies of the LHC beam {{loss in the}} SPS {{started in}} 2003 [1], [2] and {{continued}} in 2004. The <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> losses strongly depend on the batch intensity and the RF voltage. For beam with the 75 ns spacing at the same bunch intensity they are smaller than for the 25 ns spaced bunches. Large voltage on the <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> together with some optimum voltage at injection helps to reduce losses. Analysis of data from 2003 has shown that observations are compatible with a diffusion like process on the <b>flat</b> <b>bottom.</b> Therefore significant time during 2004 was devoted to studies of possible RF noise sources. However the main improvement in beam lifetime on the <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> was observed after {{a change in the}} working point in the transverse plane (MD on 1. 09. 2004).
