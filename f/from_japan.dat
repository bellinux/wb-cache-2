5|$|The Japanese navy {{expanded}} their military facilities from 1937 onwards. More labourers <b>from</b> <b>Japan</b> and Korea {{were employed to}} construct the facilities to complete the facilities within {{a short period of}} time.

Many Okinawan and Japanese labourers and permanent settlers were repartriated back to their homeland. Japanese men were conscripted into regular services, and Palauans who held administrative posts in the police force were reallocated jobs in the agricultural sector. The Japanese civilians {{played an important role in}} the islands' propaganda activities. As food resources were cut off <b>from</b> <b>Japan,</b> many Japanese encountered greater difficulties in dealing with starvation than their Palauan counterparts, who were more knowledgeable with tropical survival skills.|$|E
