Today, dolphin drive hunting no longer takes place in Hawaii.|$|E

It is all a swindle: I chose these isles as having the most beastly population, and they are far better, and far more civilised than we. I know one old chief Ko-o-amua, a great cannibal in his day, who ate his enemies even as he walked home from <b>killing</b> <b>'em,</b> and he is a perfect gentleman and exceedingly amiable and simple-minded: no fool, though.|$|R

5|$|Individual feeding territories vary in {{size from}} , with the general {{concentration}} of coyotes in a given area depending on food abundance, adequate denning sites, and competition with conspecifics and other predators. The coyote generally does not defend its territory outside of the denning season, and is much less aggressive towards intruders than the wolf is, typically chasing and sparring with them, but rarely <b>killing</b> <b>them.</b> Conflicts between coyotes can arise during times of food shortage.|$|E
5|$|Shulaprota (pierced by sharp pointed spear/dart): Some {{people give}} shelter to birds or animals {{pretending to be}} their saviours, but then harass them poking with threads, needles or using them like lifeless toys. Also, some people behave the same way to humans, winning their {{confidence}} and then <b>killing</b> <b>them</b> with sharp tridents or lances. The bodies of such sinners, fatigued with hunger and thirst, are pierced with sharp, needle-like spears. Ferocious carnivorous birds like vultures and herons tear and gorge their flesh.|$|E
5|$|The Christians were {{alleged to}} have helped General Mathews with a sum of Rs. 3,30,000/-. Hyder summoned a Portuguese officer and several Christian priests from Mangalore to suggest the {{punishment}} for the Mangalorean Catholics for treachery. The Portuguese officer suggested {{the death penalty for}} those Catholics who helped the British, because it was a fitting punishment for people who betrayed the sovereign. But Hyder exhibited a diplomatic stance and imprisoned the Christians, rather than <b>killing</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

Now fully trained, Django collects his first bounty, keeping the flyer for good luck.|$|E

He encounters the Scribe of Hecatonchires, who reveals that the Furies were originally fair in their punishment, but devolved into ruthless beings because of Ares. Continuing his pursuit of the Furies, Kratos reaches the door to Alecto's Chamber, but seemingly returns home {{to his wife and}} daughter: another illusion, this time cast by the Fury Queen Alecto.

5|$|Bounty Hunter: A new mode {{introduced}} in the game. If an online player creates too much chaos in the world, the mode will be initiated. Police, alongside one to three other players, will join the player's game {{with the hope of}} killing the hunted and claiming the bounty, which gives them experience points. The hunted could either strike back at the hunters by <b>killing</b> <b>them,</b> which gives them greater rewards, or escape from them until the bounty expires. The hunted, meanwhile, also can be assisted by another player if that player chooses to join the hunted. Players can manually place a bounty on themselves using the in-game smartphone.|$|E
5|$|Development began {{shortly after}} the release of Christmas Nights in November 1996. Producer Yuji Naka wanted to create a game which {{involved}} saving people rather than <b>killing</b> <b>them.</b> Sonic Team chose to connect the game with firefighting as they thought it was an effective way of having players identify with heroism. Burning Rangers received mostly positive reviews. Critics unanimously commended the game's soundtrack and audio, with the voice navigation system receiving particular praise. The response to the graphics was mixed, with some critics asserting that it had the best visuals on the Saturn, although it was noted for its poor collision detection and occasional glitching. The game was among the final five Saturn titles released in America.|$|E
5|$|Development of Burning Rangers started around November 1996, {{after the}} release of Sonic Team's {{previous}} game Christmas Nights (a Christmas-themed demo for Nights into Dreams...). The concept originated with the idea of rescuing people as opposed to <b>killing</b> <b>them,</b> which was an element that producer Yuji Naka felt was too common in contemporary video games. The development team of 31 (out of Sonic Team's staff of about 50) was directed by Naoto Ohshima, the director and lead designer Takao Miyoshi. The rest of the team consisted of three game planners, six programmers, eighteen designers, and two sound producers, most of whom had worked on Nights into Dreams....|$|E

Returning to the warehouse where they found Bormanis, Skinner and Doggett meet Tipet, who is trying to take his own life by pushing his head through a table saw. They rush him to the hospital, where Doggett by surprise finds Scully's name on the register. With Tipet in a coma, Kersh decides to pull the plug on the case, saying they've found the main suspect.

5|$|Historically, {{people could}} {{do little to}} protect their crops from being devastated by locusts, {{although}} eating the insects {{may have been some}} consolation. By the early 20th century, efforts were being made to disrupt the development of the insects by cultivating the soil where eggs were laid, collecting hoppers with catching machines, <b>killing</b> <b>them</b> with flamethrowers, trapping them in ditches, and crushing them with rollers and other mechanical methods. By the 1950s, the organochloride dieldrin was found to be an extremely effective insecticide, but it was later banned from use in most countries because of its persistence in the environment and its bioaccumulation in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 Syngenta bought Belgian RNAi firm Devgen for $522 {{million and}} Monsanto paid $29.2 {{million for the}} {{exclusive}} rights to intellectual property from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. The International Potato Center in Lima, Peru is looking for genes to target in the sweet potato weevil, a beetle whose larvae ravage sweet potatoes globally. Other researchers are trying to silence genes in ants, caterpillars and pollen beetles. Monsanto will likely be first to market, with a transgenic corn seed that expresses dsRNA based on gene Snf7 from the western corn rootworm, a beetle whose larvae annually cause one billion dollars in damage in the United States alone. A 2012 paper showed that silencing Snf7 stunts larval growth, <b>killing</b> <b>them</b> within days. In 2013 the same team showed that the RNA affects very few other species.|$|E
