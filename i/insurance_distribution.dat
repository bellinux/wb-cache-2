40|$|Based on {{a sample}} of 946 German {{insurance}} intermediaries, the factors that {{affect the quality of}} the information services provided by them are studied using OLS-estimations. Applying a search theoretical approach, we analyze the impact of supply and demand side variables on service quality. Besides, the working of signaling devices (like reputation, advertising or certificates) to reduce asymmetric information with respect to the service quality of insurance intermediaries is examined. The results obtained support the main hypotheses derived from industrial organization theories as to the poor working of quality competition under incomplete and asymmetric information on the side of consumers. Thus, public policy should concentrate on increasing transparency about intermediaries' (in-) dependence from insurance companies and improve consumers' financial literacy to raise the overall quality of the information services provided by insurance intermediaries.

Among the important global trends are the increasing sophistication of insurance products, the globalization of risk diversification through reinsurance, the emergence of mega-financial intermediaries, and the growing importance of supranational agencies such as the World Bank and the World Trade Organization. On the other hand, there remains significant heterogeneity among countries and regions that has a profound impact on insurance markets.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1980 's {{there has been}} a {{heightened}} academic interest in the field of commitment, particularly as it relates to business relationships. Knowledge of commitment continues to advance and has begun splintering and applied into specific and narrow fields. The particular field of interest in this study surrounds commitment levels in business relationships within property and casualty <b>insurance</b> <b>distribution</b> networks. The intent of understanding and enhancing commitment levels is to allow stakeholders to explore new ways to improve profitability. This can be achieved by deepening the level of understanding and knowledge of relationship partners with a view to anticipating and fulfilling their needs better than the competition. However, commitment is intangible and involves many factors including human emotion. This increases the difficulty in comprehending the whole phenomenon of commitment. To assist in furthering the knowledge in this area, transaction cost theory is examined and applied to insurance company and broker relationships. In seeking a greater understanding of the underlying drivers of commitment, this thesis investigates the theoretical contribution of transaction cost economics theory in assessing commitment levels. The purpose is to utilize the elements of transaction costs as a means to extend the awareness of how commitment is constructed, and to search for ways to improve and strengthen these relationships. The primary research method consists of three major case studies within the Canadian property and casualty <b>insurance</b> <b>distribution</b> sector. The first case study explores the perspectives of insurance brokers in Ontario. The second study reveals the perceptions of relationship managers employed with ING Canada, the country's largest property and casualty insurance company. Lastly, the research incorporates a series of interviews with ING Canada senior executives to capture their perspectives and validate the research findings from the first two case studies. These investigations into the Canadian insurance industry have provided several outputs, chief among them is the development of a conceptual model referred to as the 'Commitment Wheel'. This model has the advantages of seating affective and calculative commitment at the centre of a moving environment of commitment enablers.

40|$|We analyze, from {{theoretical}} and empirical standpoints, how <b>insurance</b> <b>distribution</b> channels may a§ect fraud when policyholders and service providers collude. The empirical analysis focuses on the Taiwan automobile insurance market. Striking forms of claims manipulation exist in this market: opportunistic policyholders tend to manipulate claim dates to reduce the burden of deductibles and {{to take advantage of}} the bonus-malusmechanism. We focus our attention on the role of dealer-owned agents (DOAs), since they have informational and bargaining advantages when faced with insurers and may be tempted to encourage collusion between their car repairers and policyholders. We develop an optimal contract model with claim auditing, where contracts are sold either through DOAs or through standard independent agents, and where policyholders and car repairers may collude to manipulate claims. We also use a database from the largest Taiwanese insurance company to test for the relevance of theoretical predictions. In particular, we verify that fraud occurs through the postponing of claims to the end of the policy year, possibly by Öling one single claim for several events, and we show that the fraud rate is larger among policyholders who purchase insurance through the DOA channel than among other policyholders...|$|E

This qualitative study aims to explore early mortality-related health service provision and gender inequity issues based on mothers' pregnancy, delivery and early-age survival experience in Ende district, Nusa Tenggara Timur province. Thirty-two mothers aged 18 - 45 years with at least one birth in the previous five years were interviewed in depth in May 2013. The results show most mothers have little knowledge about the danger signs for a child's illness. Mothers with early-age deaths generally did not know the cause of death. Very few mothers had received adequate information on maternal and child health during their antenatal and postnatal visits to the health facility. Some mothers expressed a preference for using a traditional birth attendant, because of their ready availability and the more extensive range of support services they provide, compared with local midwives. Unprofessional attitudes displayed by midwives were reported by several mothers. As elsewhere in Indonesia, the power of health decision-making lies with the husband. Policies aimed at elevating mothers' roles in health care decision-making are discussed as measures that would help to improve early-age survival outcomes. Widening the public health <b>insurance</b> <b>distribution,</b> especially among poorer mothers, and equalizing the geographical distribution of midwives and health facilities are recommended to tackle geographical inequities and to increase early-age survival in Ende district. 23 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} nature of the online competition between two types of online intermediaries, namely, online brokers and online agents. By exploring the price levels and price dispersion of premiums paid for term life insurance product, price data of online brokers and online agents are carefully compared. The investigation was conducted by a context and literature review, research objectives and methodology, data and result analysis, research limitations and significance. The data was collected from a price comparison website named moneysupermarket. com. In this dissertation, the author presented a detailed literature review about the popularity and significance of the Internet and e-commerce, theories about search costs and lowered prices which are related directly to the e-commerce, development and changes of the <b>insurance</b> <b>distribution</b> channel, functions of the intermediaries in the insurance market and the relationship between the Internet and online insurance transactions.

The results showed {{the nature of}} the online competitions in different insurance intermediary markets. The competition among online brokers who sell insurance products at an average lower price seems to be more intensive than the competition among online agents who sell homogeneous insurance products at an average higher price.
