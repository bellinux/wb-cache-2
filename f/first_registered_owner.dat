50|$|After {{arriving}} in America in 1699, nine Dutch settlers (Simon Van Ness, Gerebrand Clawson, Hans Spier, Elias Franson, Christopher Steinmets, Andrese Louwrentz, Garret Vanderhoof, Hessell Pieters and Jan Spier) purchased the 14,000 acre (57 km²) Horseneck Tract from the Lenape Native Americans for goods equal to about $325 today. Simon Van Ness owned 300 {{acres of the}} north-east boundary. He also gathered some of this land through private contracts with the Lenape Native Americans. Eventually, he ran into trouble with the Lords Proprietor of the region, so he accepted their terms and got a deed on September 3, 1744, confirming he owned the land. After his death in 1749, Simon distributed the land to his four children and two sons-in-law. His son Isaac was given most {{of what is now}} Fairfield, New Jersey. Isaac's son Peter was named executor of the will of Isaac Reyken (Ryker) on September 30, 1768.
