25|$|Respiratory {{damage is}} related to the {{concentration}} of the gas and its solubility. <b>Irritant</b> <b>gas</b> exposures predominantly affect the airways, causing tracheitis, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis. Other inhaled agents may be directly toxic (e.g. cyanide, carbon monoxide), or cause harm simply by displacing oxygen and producing asphyxia (e.g. methane, carbon dioxide). The effect of inhaling irritant gases depends on the extent and duration of exposure and on the specific agent Chlorine, phosgene, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and ammonia are among the most important irritant gases. Hydrogen sulfide is also a potent cellular toxin, blocking the cytochrome system and inhibiting cellular respiration. More water-soluble gases (e.g. chlorine, ammonia, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride) dissolve in the upper airway and immediately cause mucous membrane irritation, which may alert people to the need to escape the exposure. Permanent damage to the upper respiratory tract, distal airways, and lung parenchyma occurs only if escape from the gas source is impeded. Less soluble gases (e.g. nitrogen dioxide, phosgene, ozone) may not dissolve until they are well into the respiratory tract, often reaching the lower airways. These agents are less likely to produce early warning signs (phosgene in low concentrations has a pleasant odor), are more likely to cause severe bronchiolitis, and often have a lag of ≥ 12 h before symptoms of pulmonary edema develop.|$|E
40|$|Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is a {{rare disease}} {{involving}} concentric bronchiolar fibrosis that develops rapidly following inhalation of certain <b>irritant</b> <b>gases</b> at sufficiently high acute doses. While there are many potential causes of bronchiolar lesions involved {{in a variety of}} chronic lung diseases, failure to clearly define the clinical features and pathological characteristics can lead to ambiguous diagnoses. <b>Irritant</b> <b>gases</b> known to cause BO follow a similar pathologic process and time course of disease onset in humans. Studies of inhaled <b>irritant</b> <b>gases</b> known to cause BO (e. g., chlorine, hydrochloric acid, ammonia, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, sulfur or nitrogen mustards, and phosgene) indicate that the time course between causal chemical exposures and development of clinically significant BO disease is typically limited to a few months. The mechanism of toxic action exerted by these <b>irritant</b> <b>gases</b> generally involves widespread and severe injury of the epithelial lining of the bronchioles that leads to acute respiratory symptoms which can include lung edema within days. Repeated exposures to inhaled <b>irritant</b> <b>gases</b> at concentrations insufficient to cause marked respiratory distress or edema may lead to adaptive responses that can reduce or prevent severe bronchiolar fibrotic changes. Risk of BO from <b>irritant</b> <b>gases</b> is driven substantially by toxicokinetics affecting concentrations occurring at the bronchiolar epithelium. Highly soluble <b>irritant</b> <b>gases</b> that cause BO like ammonia generally follow a threshold-dependent cytotoxic mechanism of action that at sufficiently high doses results in severe inflammation of the upper respiratory tract and the bronchiolar epithelium concurrently. This is followed by acute respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, and post inflammatory concentric fibrosis that become clinically obvious within a few months. In contrast, <b>irritant</b> <b>gases</b> with lower solubility like phosgene also follow a threshold-dependent mechanism of cytotoxicity action but can exhibit more insidious and isolated bronchiolar tissue damage with a similar latency to fibrosis. To date, animal and human studies on the highly soluble gas, diacetyl, have not identified a coherent pattern of pathology and latency that would be expected based on studies of other known causes of bronchiolitis obliterans disease...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to elucidate whether repeated peak exposures with respiratory symptoms, gassings, to sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and other <b>irritant</b> <b>gases</b> could increase the risk of chronic bronchitis. METHODS: The study population comprised 3, 060 Swedish pulp mill workers (84 % males) from a cohort study, who completed a comprehensive questionnaire with items on chronic bronchitis symptoms, smoking habit, occupational history, and specific exposures, including gassings. 2, 037 have worked in sulphite mills. Incidence rates and hazard ratios (HRs) for the observation period, 1970 - 2000, in relation to exposure and the frequency of repeated gassings to SO 2 and other <b>irritant</b> <b>gases</b> were calculated. RESULTS: The incidence rate for chronic bronchitis among workers with repeated gassings was 3. 5 / 1, 000 person-years compared with 1. 5 / 1, 000 person-years among unexposed workers (HR 2. 1, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 4 - 3. 1). The risk was even higher in the subgroup with frequent gassings (HR 3. 2, 95 % CI 2. 0 - 5. 2), particularly among never-smokers (HR 8. 7, 95 % CI 3. 5 - 22). CONCLUSIONS: Repeated gassings to <b>irritant</b> <b>gases</b> increased the incidence of chronic bronchitis in our study population during and after work in pulp mills, supporting the hypothesis that occupational exposures to irritants negatively affect the airways.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigated}} whether chronic airflow limitation and rapid decline in pulmonary function {{were associated with}} peak exposures to ozone and other <b>irritant</b> <b>gases</b> in pulp mills. Bleachery workers potentially exposed to irritant gassings (n 5178) from three Swedish pulp mills, and a comparison group of workers not exposed to irritant gassings (n 554) from two paper mills, were studied. Baseline surveys occurred in 1995 – 1996, with follow-up surveys in 1998 – 1999. Participants performed spirometry and answered questions regarding ozone, chlorine dioxide (ClO 2), and sulphur dioxide (SO 2) gassings. From regression models controlling for potential confounders, declines in both the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) (- 24 mL?yr- 1) and the forced vital capacity (FVC) (- 19 mL?yr- 1) were associated with ClO 2 /SO 2 gassings. At follow-up, the prevalence of chronic airflow limitation (i. e. FEV 1 /FVC less than the lower limit of normal) was elevated for participants with only pre-baseline ozone gassings and with both pre-baseline and interval ozone gassings, after controlling for potential confounders. These findings suggest that obstructive effects among bleachery workers are associated with ozone gassings, and that adverse effects on spirometry might also accompany chlorine dioxide/ sulphur dioxide gassings.

Collectively, the wealth of published evidence supports the conclusion that, if the acute stage of pulmonary edema with its attendant anoxic anoxia is survived, circulatory failure may become a more important factor in the ultimate outcome [65].

30|$|Although {{considered}} an <b>irritant</b> <b>gas</b> {{due to its}} high water solubility, chlorine (Cl 2) readily partitions into the fluids lining the airways. Once Cl 2 is dissolved into the fluids lining the airways, epithelial damage and desquamation occur {{as a result of}} oxidative injury. This may occur with exposure to Cl 2, and further damage to the epithelium may occur with the migration and activation of inflammatory cells. Repair of the airway epithelium following Cl 2 -induced injury may not necessarily restore normal structure and function, as evidenced by subepithelial fibrosis and excessive mucous hyperplasia. The oxidative mechanism of toxicity caused by chlorine is less specific than that attributed to the more selective electrophilic reactivity of phosgene. Hence, while chlorine may elicit different patterns of injury (airway injury with or without alveolar damage) depending on the inhaled dose and concentration, phosgene damage is largely independent on concentration and restricted to alveolar injury. Thus, anti-inflammatory countermeasures can be anticipated to be efficacious for chlorine-induced lung injuries, whereas they can be anticipated to be ineffective or even contraindicated for phosgene.|$|E
