500|$|The album's {{ethereal}} artwork mirrors its [...] "delicacy and introverted romance". The cover art, shot by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin in Los Angeles, California, is a {{black and}} white photograph of Björk lying down on the patterned ground next to a swimming pool, covering <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sun and wearing her Marjan Pejoski swan dress that caused a stir at the 73rd Academy Awards. The duo M/M (Paris), known for applying and integrating their work on photographs (so called dessin dans l'image, or [...] "drawings in the picture"), illustrated the cover, featuring a swan and the album's title with feathers. Björk thought swans embodied Vespertines music, describing them as [...] "a white, sort of winter bird" [...] and [...] "very romantic". Vespertine came with a booklet of M/M (Paris) artwork.|$|E
2500|$|Next, Riccardo is {{presented}} with a complaint against a fortune-teller named Ulrica (Madame Arvidson), accused of witchcraft. A magistrate calls for her banishment, but Oscar the page defends her (Aria: Volta la terrea / [...] "Turning <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> earth"). Riccardo resolves to investigate for himself and tells {{the members of the}} court to disguise themselves and to meet him at Ulrica's lodging later that day.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, I {{suppose you}} must have your joke,' {{answered}} the fox lightly, but never removing <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wolf, who replied with a snarl which showed all his teeth: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems we}} are not going into Mazatlan, after all," [...] said Miss Keene at last, without lifting <b>her</b> {{conscious}} <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you {{for your}} confidence," [...] she breathed softly, resolutely keeping <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> {{measuring}} <b>the</b> distance to the revolver, and keeping her foot pressed firmly on the bell.|$|R
60|$|Philippa withdrew <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea. There was a queer {{little smile}} upon her lips.|$|E
60|$|Harriet trembled {{more and}} more, {{but did not}} avert <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> eager look that rested on them.|$|E
60|$|Dorothy did not notice. She was shading <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{sun with}} her arm, looking anxiously down the road.|$|E
60|$|The woman turned <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> slowly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fresh earth, {{and laying}} {{her hands on}} the {{shoulders}} of her husband, stood, looking him anxiously in the eyes.|$|R
60|$|Miss Henley raised <b>her</b> tearful <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{floor to}} his wan features, that now {{appeared}} illumined {{with more than}} human fires, and her pale lips quivered, but her voice was inaudible.|$|R
6000|$|Anne's lip quivered as she murmured, without {{removing}} <b>her</b> wet <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vacant and solemn horizon, '"They that {{go down to}} the sea in ships, that {{do business}} in great waters--"' ...|$|R
60|$|Grace did {{not move}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> birds, and folded her {{delicate}} lips as if {{to keep them in}} subjection.|$|E
6000|$|Miss De Stancy blushed with {{pleasure}} when she raised <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> machine. 'Is she not thoughtful {{to let me}} know beforehand?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't push! You can see {{as well as}} I," [...] said Retty, the auburn-haired and {{youngest}} girl, without removing <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> window.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you so {{long been}} devoted to your profession?" [...] resumed Mrs Wyllys, bending <b>her</b> {{thoughtful}} <b>eye,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ingenuous countenance of her pupil, once more towards the features of him she addressed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm coming in," [...] Elsbeth murmured with <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> to the telescope. [...] "Cassiopeia," [...] she murmured. [...] "Where are you all?" [...] she asked, taking <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> telescope. [...] "How dark it is!" ...|$|R
5000|$|At length <b>her</b> languid <b>eyes</b> clos'd <b>from</b> <b>the</b> day,:: The idol of my {{soul was}} torn away; ...|$|R
60|$|Here Mrs. Henry raised <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> letter {{as if she}} {{had read}} all that related to the subject, and Phonny {{immediately}} exclaimed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Young folk!" [...] exclaimed Mrs Gore, as she shaded <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{sun with}} her hand, and gazed earnestly at the band which was approaching.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{like to give}} pain {{to people}} who have given pain to me,' she said smartly, without {{removing}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> green liquid in her hand.|$|E
60|$|At {{first she}} gave him no glance of recognition: he was {{invisible}} to her abstracted gaze. The delirium was not fixed, however; having weaned <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> contemplating <b>the</b> outer darkness, by degrees she centred her attention on him, and discovered who it was that held her.|$|R
60|$|Hetty looked distressed, turning <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> one to <b>the</b> other, {{but she had}} {{no answer}} to give to the {{question}} of the reckless Hurry.|$|R
6000|$|Over {{the crest}} she flies from, [...] Into its hollow she drops, [...] Crouches and clears <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> [...] <b>The</b> wind-torn breaker-tops, [...] Ere {{out on the}} shrieking {{shoulder}} [...] Of a hill-high surge she drives. [...] Meet her! Meet her and hold her! [...] Pull for your scoundrel lives! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I to go?" [...] said Mrs. Trevelyan to her sister. But Nora said never a word. She sat {{perfectly}} fixed, {{not turning}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> object {{on which she}} was gazing.|$|E
6000|$|Recalling <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> distance, {{she looked}} at me again now, with her former air. Mr. Littimer, {{clearing}} his throat behind his hand with a respectable short cough, changed legs, and went on: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{place is}} still vacant, and I shall be {{very glad to}} give it to you, if you incline to take it," [...] said Lady Trevlyn, lifting <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> note and {{scanning}} the boy's face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, mercy! It's ten o'clock!" [...] Mrs. Schoville {{suddenly}} cried, {{her husband}} having at last caught <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> across <b>the</b> room. [...] "I'm so sorry I can't hear the rest, Mr. St. Vincent, how you escaped and all that. But {{you must come}} and see me. I am just dying to hear!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Weary {{was the old}} Witch; [...] She rested <b>her</b> old <b>eyes</b> [...] <b>From</b> <b>the</b> lantern-fruited yew trees, [...] And {{the scarlet}} of the skies; ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How kind of you, Polly; I {{was just}} wishing {{you were here}} to arrange my flowers. These lovely daphnes will give odor to my camellias, and you were a dear to bring them. There 's my dress; {{how do you like}} it?" [...] said Fanny, hardly daring to lift <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> under <b>the</b> yellow tower on her head.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I was under, I {{had another}} above me; and now, as I'm upper, why there's others under me." [...] So she {{explained}} her {{position at the}} hotel, but she never took <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> canopy.|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned up}} the lamp without moving <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> little white-clad figure. A great {{trembling}} was upon her! It was like {{a voice from the}} shadows of another world. And Matravers, why did he not speak? ...|$|E
60|$|She {{could not}} speak; {{she did not}} know what to say, and she saw her husband when she {{followed}} him with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> window, drag heavily down toward the corner, where he was to take, the horse-car.|$|E
60|$|Dea Flavia, of a truth, {{had little}} {{thought of my}} lord Hortensius Martius, of his {{ambition}} or of his love; she could not tear <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> spot beyond the stuccoed walls where lay a man--helpless now--but a man whose every deed proclaimed him the born ruler of men.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{travelled}} slowly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{window to}} the Doctor's face. Without the slightest outward appearance of agitation, she put the 'painful question' in these extraordinary words: ...|$|R
50|$|Back in Africa, Nelly is seen {{singing a}} {{beautiful}} love song, her sad reflection in a pond, tears dripping <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> of <b>her</b> jungle friends. Moments later, another male giraffe begins singing {{along with her}} and {{as if all the}} darkness in her life disappears, the two fall in love and the cartoon ends.|$|R
