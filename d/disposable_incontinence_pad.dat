40|$|The {{absorption}} cores in <b>disposable</b> nappies, <b>incontinence</b> <b>pads</b> {{and female}} hygiene products are manufactured by a dry mat-forming process. Cellulose fibers and super-absorbing particles are suspended in air and blown onto a forming wheel on which the cores are formed. It is vital {{for the quality of}} the product that the fibres and particles are evenly distributed in the suspension. The purpose of this project has been to establish a platform of scientific knowledge from which the fluid mechanics aspect of the manufacturing process can be understood. To better understand the problems relevant to the process, air/particle flows and air/fiber flows have been studied separately. A two-fluid model with a modified &# 954;-&# 949; model for the gas phase has been used to simulate a horizontal air/particle flow. An optical probe and a calibration procedure for measuring the local particle volume fraction have been developed and used to verify the models. The probe uses two optical fibres, to emit infrared light and detect light reflected by the particles. The calibration procedure {{is based on the assumption}} that light paths including reflections on more than one particle do not make a significant contribution to the probe signal. Measurements of a horizontal air/particle flow have been made to verify the simulations. The agreement between simulations and experiments is good. For the air/fiber flow, it is suggested that a two-fluid model be used together with a turbulence model for the gas phase and a transport equation for a floc characterizing scalar. This scalar may be either flocculation intensity or floc size. A technique for characterizing the flow using optical probes has been developed. Measurements of floc velocity and size distributions have been made in a production-scale facility for process research. The shape of the measured floc size distribution indicates that the mechanism for aggregating fibres into flocs is strong compared to the mechanism for breaking up flocs...|$|R
5000|$|An <b>incontinence</b> <b>pad</b> is a small, {{impermeable}} multi-layered {{sheet with}} high absorbency {{that is used}} in the incontinence and health-care industries as a precaution against urinary incontinence. It is generally made of cotton if washable or paper if disposable.

50|$|Incontinence {{underwear}} {{is a type}} of reusable undergarment {{designed to}} absorb urine. It provides an alternative to traditional <b>disposable</b> <b>incontinence</b> products, which are often bulky and plastic-based. Due to concerns about the environmental impact of <b>disposable</b> products, <b>incontinence</b> underwear is becoming an alternative to pads. Only recently has the textile technology existed to enable the design and manufacture of reusable products with comparable functionality to a disposable pad or diaper.|$|R
50|$|Many {{people who}} {{experience}} urinary <b>incontinence</b> use menstrual <b>pads</b> to manage bladder leaks. However, since menstrual pads {{are designed to}} absorb menstrual flow, {{they will not be}} as effective in absorbing urinary leaks.

40|$|Background/ Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to give insight into the {{referral}} pattern of a GP when the diagnosis urinary incontinence is made and to what extend the GP prescribes medication and <b>incontinence</b> <b>pads.</b> We also examined the influence of gender and age of the patient and gender of the GP on these patterns. Methods: The data were obtained from the Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice (DNSGP- 2). The {{aim of this}} survey was to give representative information on morbidity in the Dutch population, use of health services at patient level, health determinants and socio-demographic characteristics. Odds ratios, confidence intervals and p-values were calculated using the SAS-procedure PROC GLIMMIX (a multi logistic model). Results: Only 11. 6 % of all patients of 25 years and older with urinary incontinence was referred to a physiotherapist, 2. 4 % to a gynaecologist and 2. 9 % to an urologist. Besides, the number of female patients referred drops significantly after 60 years of age. In contrast, the number of <b>incontinence</b> <b>pads</b> prescribed increases significantly. Gender of the GP has no influence on prescription or referrals. Male patients were significantly less referred than female patients. Conclusion: We conclude that instead of prescribing <b>incontinence</b> <b>pads</b> the GP should refer more elderly patients to a physiotherapist. There is sufficient evidence that pelvic floor muscle training and bladder training work. As a consequence the use of <b>incontinence</b> <b>pads</b> will decrease and the quality of life will increase...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to provide insight into the {{referral}} pattern of newly diagnosed patients with urinary incontinence in general practice and into the prescription of medication and <b>incontinence</b> <b>pads</b> by general practitioners (GPs). We also examined the influence of gender and age of patient/GP on these patterns. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice. We used registered new episodes for urinary incontinence of patients of 25 years and older in the year 2001 and examined the initial management. RESULTS: Twelve per cent of the patients were referred to a physiotherapist, 2. 4 % to a gynaecologist and 2. 9 % to a urologist. Medication was prescribed to 9. 8 % and 12. 7 % received <b>incontinence</b> <b>pads.</b> The number of female patients referred decreased significantly after 60 years of age and the number of <b>incontinence</b> <b>pads</b> and medication prescribed was higher in this age patient group. Gender of the GP did not influence the prescription or referral rate. Male patients were significantly less frequently referred than female patients. CONCLUSION: The lower referral rate and higher prescription rate of <b>incontinence</b> <b>pads</b> and medication at older age indicate that GPs are not sufficiently aware of the benefits of pelvic floor muscle training and bladder training at older age. We did not find an influence of gender of the GP on management of urinary incontinence, unlike previous research.

40|$|Many {{elderly people}} {{entering}} residential or nursing care are already incontinent to some degree, relying on <b>incontinence</b> <b>pads</b> {{to deal with}} the consequences. A proportion of these people have been shown to exhibit a regular pattern in their incontinence, which opens up the possibility of mitigating the problem by instituting an individual toileting regime for the person.

This paper covers the development and evaluation of a sensor for detecting incontinence events, suitable for use in this setting, and describes the design of an associated electronic logger. The devices form part of an assessment system intended to identify a pattern in incontinence where it exists, and to help with the design of the toilet regime for an individual. The requirement is that the system must reliably record incontinence events, and present the information describing them in a manner appropriate to the users of the devices, who are likely to be non-technical and non-specialist. <br/...|$|R
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} of disposable products {{are responding to}} the changing market dynamics by introducing <b>disposable</b> <b>incontinence</b> underwear that gives the appearance of normal fabric underwear.

50|$|The {{invention}} of superabsorbent polymers (for diapers and <b>incontinence</b> <b>pads),</b> and of blood-gelling polymers (for sanitary pads) largely displaced traditional cloth diapers and pads. Not only were these modern absorbent materials lighter and less bulky, but they became available as an “all-in-one” solution {{with its own}} integral waterproof plastic backing.

The usage of adult diapers can be a source of embarrassment, and products are often marketed under euphemisms such as <b>incontinence</b> <b>pads.</b> [...] The most common adult users of diapers are those with medical conditions which cause them to experience urinary like bed wetting or fecal incontinence, or those who are bedridden or otherwise limited in their mobility.|$|R
40|$|Incontinence-associated {{dermatitis}} (IAD) is {{a common}} problem in patients with faecal and/or urinary incontinence.

40|$|Increasing life {{expectancy}} {{results in an}} ageing society {{in parts of the}} world. The old of tomorrow are also expected to have higher comfort demands. One likely consequence is an increase in the need of such products as <b>disposable</b> <b>incontinence</b> diapers, which are today partly based on cellulose from forestry. A calculation of the potential increase for heavy incontinence care (assuming the use of <b>disposable</b> <b>incontinence</b> diapers) was made based on the demographic trends for Europe and on the yield from forestry performed under Nordic conditions. The calculation is using a parameterisation known from literature: I = i * m * u * P. It expresses the impact (I, in our case, forest area in ha) as a product of four factors that humans have the ability to change, in our case, i = ha Nordic forest area / kg material, m = kg material / service, u = service / population in Europe, and P = population in Europe. The 'service' is to keep a customer with heavy incontinence dry for a year, assuming that the same fraction of the population above 50 years as today will need heavy incontinence protection. Under these assumptions, the forest area needed for heavy incontinence care in Europe will increase with about 75 % until 2050. According to the current work in the WooDi research project, aiming at producing a wood-based diaper, if the petroleum-based material in the absorbent core in the diapers were to be replaced by wood-based, this would increase the needed forest area to about 136 %, assuming a 1 : 1 replacement ratio by weight which seems to be a low estimate. This is still a small share of the total European forest area (0. 2 %). However, such an increase in wood demand for only one product is not without problems, since forests to a large extent are already utilised, e. g. for timber and pulp and paper production, and since there is an expected increase in demand for bio-based fuels and materials for replacement of fossil-based products, thus competing for either the yield from the forests or for the land area. At the same time, there are rising concerns regarding biodiversity and other ecosystem services in connection to forestry...|$|R
