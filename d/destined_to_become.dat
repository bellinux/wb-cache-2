5|$|By the 1730s, {{the rating}} volunteer-per-order was phased out and {{replaced}} with a system where prospective midshipmen served as servants for officers. For example, a captain was allowed four servants for every 100men aboard his ship; many of these servants were young men <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> officers.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the Strip {{west of the}} Toledo area is a prime {{location}} for agriculture, because of its well-drained, fertile loam soil.

5|$|Benedictine monasticism, {{present in}} England from the 6th century, was greatly {{extended}} after the Norman Invasion in 1066. There {{were also a}} number of Cistercian abbeys, but these were often in remote areas and not <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> cathedrals. The Romanesque architecture of Normandy replaced that of Saxon England, the buildings being generally larger and more spacious, the general arrangement of monastic buildings following those of the great Abbey of Cluny. The Romanesque style, of which the English form is often known as Norman architecture, developed local characteristics.|$|E

Müncheberg was <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a Geschwaderkommodore but prior to receiving his own command {{he would have to}} serve as a Kommodore in training.

5|$|After {{finishing}} his four-year college eligibility, Bowen was {{eligible for the}} 1993 NBA draft, but went undrafted.

5|$|Both Robert Bingham and Percy Haly died in 1937; with J. C. W. Beckham aging—he {{would die}} in 1940—Chandler moved {{to fill the}} {{leadership}} void in the faction. He soon came {{to believe he was}} <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> President of the United States. In mid-1937, he began advocating for Marvel Mills Logan, Kentucky's junior senator, to be appointed to the Supreme Court, creating a Senate vacancy to which Chandler, as governor, could appoint himself. The death of Justice George Sutherland in January 1938 gave President Franklin D. Roosevelt the opportunity to accommodate Chandler's wishes, but Roosevelt preferred younger justices—Logan was 63—and Kentucky's senior Senator, Alben Barkley, recommended Solicitor General Stanley Forman Reed for the appointment. Roosevelt heeded Barkley's advice and appointed Reed instead of Logan.|$|E

5|$|Euler's formal {{education}} started in Basel, {{where he was}} sent to live with his maternal grandmother. In 1720, aged thirteen, he enrolled at the University of Basel, and in 1723, he received a Master of Philosophy with a dissertation that compared the philosophies of Descartes and Newton. During that time, he was receiving Saturday afternoon lessons from Johann Bernoulli, who quickly discovered his new pupil's incredible talent for mathematics. At that time Euler's main studies included theology, Greek, and Hebrew at his father's urging in order to become a pastor, but Bernoulli convinced his father that Leonhard was <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a great mathematician.|$|E
5|$|Growing up {{primarily}} at Langley Field, Virginia, Olds virtually made daily {{contact with the}} small group of officers who would lead the US Army Air Forces in World War II (one neighbor was Major Carl Spaatz, <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> the first Chief of Staff of the USAF), and as a result was imbued with an unusually strong dedication to the air service, and conversely, with a low tolerance for officers who did not exhibit the same. On November 10, 1925, his father appeared as a witness on behalf of Billy Mitchell during Mitchell's court-martial in Washington, D.C.. He brought three-year-old Robin with him to court, dressed in an Air Service uniform, and posed with him for newspaper photographers before testifying.|$|E

On 15 December 1943, he became Coordinator, Finschhafen. Finschhafen was <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> the new hub of US activity in Papua-New Guinea; but an enormous amount of work was required to get the base ready for action.

40|$|A {{typology}} of music distribution models is proposed {{consisting of the}} ownership model, the access model, and the context model. These models are not substitutes {{for each other and}} may co‐exist serving different market niches.

During this process, access‐based services temporarily generate economic value, but such services are <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> eventually <b>become</b> commoditised...|$|R
5|$|Scully goes to Agent Robert Comer, {{whom she}} was forced to shoot after his attempt on William's life, and uses the alien {{artifact}} to heal him. Comer explains that Josepho believes a physical manifestation of God exists inside the spacecraft. According to an ancient prophecy, William is <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> the savior of humanity, but only if Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is still alive. If he dies, William will instead lead the Colonists. Comer claims that Mulder was supposedly killed by the cult in order for the aliens to successfully invade; he tried to kill William to prevent him from causing humanity's destruction. Suddenly, a nurse and the Toothpick Man (Alan Dale) arrive and ask Reyes and Scully to leave. Comer ends up alone with the Toothpick Man.|$|E
5|$|Still {{convinced}} he was <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> president, Chandler attended the 1956 Democratic National Convention with hopes of securing the party's presidential nomination. Despite {{being told by}} his advisors that the convention would nominate Adlai Stevenson, Chandler continued to seek the nomination, but received only 36 1/2 votes. Following Stevenson's nomination, Chandler returned to Kentucky bitterly disappointed. Due {{to the death of}} Senator Alben Barkley and the expiration of Senator Clements' term, Kentucky would also elect two senators in November 1956. Clements was seeking re-election, and the state Democratic committee chose Wetherby as the nominee for Barkley's seat. Chandler refused to use his office to support Stevenson, Clements, or Wetherby, and Republicans Dwight D. Eisenhower, John Sherman Cooper, and Thruston Ballard Morton won the presidential and senatorial races in the state.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Scully, distrustful of both Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes), circumvents the FBI's investigation into William's kidnapping and performs her own, assisted by Reyes and The Lone Gunmen. Scully discovers that William has been taken by a UFO cult that believes William is <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> the savior of mankind, but only if Fox Mulder is still alive. If Mulder is dead, William will lead the forces of evil: the alien invaders.|$|E
