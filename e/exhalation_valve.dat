40|$|Certification tests {{currently}} {{employed by}} some industrialized nations to certify respirators require that when challenged with air flow {{at a constant}} suction head of 25 mmH 2 O, the leakage into the facepiece from the <b>exhalation</b> <b>valve(s)</b> should not exceed 30 mlmin 1. However, the test alone might not reflect the leakage rate under different levels of vacuum. To study the characteristics of leakage through <b>exhalation</b> <b>valves,</b> a leakage meter was built to measure the leakage rate of four brands of <b>exhalation</b> <b>valves.</b> Seven valves of each brand were tested for leakage rate at pressure drops ranging from 15 to 45 mmH 2 O (or extended to 75 mmH 2 O for some valves). Two types of leaks, i. e. fiber insertion and arch dent on the valve seat, were used to investigate the effect of leak shape on the characteristic leak flow {{as a function of}} pressure drop. A leakage data point represented a mean value of five measurements. The results showed that the leakage rate could increase or decrease with increasing pressure drop inside the respirators, indicating that the current method of conducting leakage tests, at a constant suction head of 25 mmH 2 O, does not guarantee better protection than when the respirators are used at a lower suction head. Moreover, based on the sample valves tested in this study, it was found that valve leakage wasmostly caused by defects in the valve seats. Both fiber-insertion and arch-dent leak...|$|R

50|$|Commonly {{known as}} “Assist/Control”; CMV is a breath {{sequence}} for which spontaneous breaths are not possible between mandatory breaths because every patient trigger signal in the trigger window produces a machine cycled inspiration (i.e., a mandatory breath).

In some pressure controlled modes on ventilators with an active <b>exhalation</b> <b>valve,</b> spontaneous breaths may occur during mandatory breaths, but the defining characteristic of CMV is that spontaneous breaths are not permitted between mandatory breaths.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} these {{requirements}} is to ensure the safe use of respirators and dust masks. They cover use, inspection, maintenance, and storage. They apply to workers and supervisors. 2 Requirements 2. 1 Use Respirators are issued to individual workers for protection against airborne contaminant(s), only after authorization and completion of required respiratory medical evaluation, training, and a practical fit test. Respirators must not be worn for any other purpose without the knowledge and approval of the supervisor and the ESH coordinator. Authorization to use a respirator, including medical evaluation, training, and fit testing, must be renewed each year. Changes in respirator used, work conditions, or the worker’s physical condition may require repeating some of the authorization process. (See Respiratory Protection: Evaluation and Certification Procedure.) 2. 2 Inspection Workers must inspect their respirators before and after use. Respirator inspections must include checking that 1. Sealing surface are clean and free of cracks and holes 2. Rubber and elastic parts have good pliability and no signs of deterioration 3. Inhalation and <b>exhalation</b> <b>valves</b> are clean and seated properly 4. Straps are sufficiently elastic and free of worn areas 5.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Some {{patients}} {{suffering from}} laryngeal cancer {{have to be}} treated with a total laryngectomy. As part of their rehabilitation of voice, a shunt valve can be placed between the trachea and oesophagus. If the patient wants to speak, the stoma is closed with a finger or thumb to force expired air through the shunt valve into the oesophagus. Soft tissue {{at the top of the}} oesophagus starts to vibrate and thus functions as new vocal folds. Some of these patients use an automatic tracheostoma valve (ATV) on their stoma. This enables them to speak without using their hands. The department of Biomedical Engineering of the University Medical Centre Groningen has developed a new ATV. This new ATV can be automatically closed by inhalation, in contrast to the currently used <b>exhalation</b> <b>valves.</b> By this means the patient should be able to save more air for phonation. The hypothesis is that patients are able to speak longer and louder using the new automatic tracheostoma valve. METHODS: To verify these expectations, 14 patients were equipped with a prototype of the new inhalation valve and a commercially available exhalation ATV. For every patient the phonation time, loudness, frequency, intratracheal pressure and flow during speech were measured for both valves. After this, patients were asked to fill out a questionnaire about which valve they preferred. RESULTS: There is no significant difference found in the measured parameters between both valves, but most patients are of the opinion that the new valve is more easy to use. CONCLUSIONS: The new inhalation speech valve proves to be comparable to the existing speech valve. Further development will result in an optimal product, which could be better than existing automatic tracheostoma valves.

50|$|Inhalation {{closes the}} {{mouthpiece}} <b>exhalation</b> non-return <b>valve</b> and draws gas through the inhalation non-return valve. The pressure drop draws {{the contents of}} the outer bellows through the scrubber, inhalation hose, non-return valve and mouthpiece to the diver. As the concentric bellows contract, the pressure in the inner bellows increases and first closes the internal non-return valve, then pushes its contents through the outer non-return valve, discharging to the surroundings.When the bellows is fully contracted, the bottom cover triggers the gas addition valves which inject gas until the diver stops inhaling and the bottom cover no longer presses against the addition valve actuator.If the gas in the breathing circuit has been compressed by an increase in depth, the gas volume will be even less and the addition valves will be triggered for longer, bringing the volume back to the appropriate level. The RB80 uses two addition valves in parallel, so that if one fails, the other will provide the required gas.|$|R
50|$|The {{facemask}} on the spacer has valves which {{insure that}} the medication suspended in the chamber is inhaled by the patient, and that the exhaled breath exits the device through the <b>exhalation</b> <b>valve</b> mounted in the mask. When using a spacer without a facemask, the patient must inhale through their mouth and exhale through their nose. Spacers with facemasks are used in toddlers and young children because that population is unable to coordinate inhaling through the mouth and exhaling through the nose. However, the facemasks are available in small, medium, and large sizes, and spacers with facemasks may also {{be used in the}} adult and elderly population.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{physiological}} {{impact of the}} N 95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) on healthcare workers. METHODS: Ten healthcare workers each conducted multiple 1 -hour treadmill walking sessions, at 1. 7 miles/h, and at 2. 5 miles/h, while wearing FFR with <b>exhalation</b> <b>valve,</b> FFR without <b>exhalation</b> <b>valve,</b> and without FFR (control session). We monitored heart rate, respiratory rate, tidal volume, minute volume, blood oxygen saturation, and transcutaneously measured PCO 2. We also measured user comfort and exertion, FFR moisture retention, and the carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations in the FFR’s dead space. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences}} between FFR and control in the physiological variables, exertion scores, or comfort scores. There was no significant difference in moisture retention between FFR with and without <b>exhalation</b> <b>valve.</b> Two subjects had peak PCO 2 > 50 mm Hg. The FFR with <b>exhalation</b> <b>valve</b> offered no benefit in physiological burden over the FFR without valve. The FFR dead-space oxygen and carbon dioxide levels did not meet the Occupa-tional Safety and Health Administration’s ambient workplace standards. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy healthcare workers, FFR did not impose any important physiological burden during 1 hour of use, at realistic clinical work rates, but the FFR dead-space carbon dioxide and oxygen levels were significantly above and below, respectively, the ambient workplace standards, and elevated PCO 2 is a possibility...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Ventilator exhalation-valve {{performance}} during the expiratory phase has been stud-ied in depth. An active <b>exhalation</b> <b>valve</b> uses servo-control technology that allows gas {{to be released}} from the <b>exhalation</b> <b>valve</b> during the inspiratory phase if the patient makes an expiratory effort. We con-ducted a bench study of active <b>exhalation</b> <b>valve</b> response to expiratory effort during the inspiratory phase. METHODS: We studied 4 ventilators that have active exhalation valves (Maquet Servo-i, New-port e 500, Puritan Bennett 840, and Evita XL) and one that does not (Puritan Bennett 7200 ae). With an active test lung we simulated various magnitudes of expiratory effort {{during the middle of the}} inspira-tory phase. We measured the exhalation resistance and pressure over-shoot during the expiratory effort, and we measured the pressure under-shoot after the expiratory effort. The exhalation resistance of the 7200 ae could not be determined because this ventilator did not allow any gas-release through the <b>exhalation</b> <b>valve</b> during the expiratory effort. RESULTS: The exhalation resistance of the Evita XL (6. 61. 8 cm H 2 O/L/s) was higher than that of the Servo-i (3. 01. 3 cm H 2 O/L/s), e 500 (2. 60. 8 cm H 2 O/ L/s), and 840 (3. 5 0. 8 cm H 2 O/L/s) (all P <. 001). The magnitude of pressure over-shoot during the expiratory efforts was not significantly different among the 4 ventilators with active exhalation valves. Pressure over-shoot was significantly higher with the 7200 ae than with any of other ventilators (all P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant difference in exhalation resistance between the Evita XL and the other 3 ventilators with active exhalation valves. All 4 ventilators with active exha-lation valves had lower exhalation resistance than the 7200 ae.

40|$|Background: Home care {{ventilators}} hold {{a prominent}} {{place in the world}} of mechanical ventilation, and careful selection of ventilator modes and settings profoundly impact patient outcomes. In addition to patient factors, exhalation valves can generate expiratory resistance (ER) and can increase work-of-breathing and contribute to auto-PEEP. Analyzing ER on new homecare ventilators is crucial to patient care. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the affects of tidal volume (Vt) and PEEP on ER on the Pulmonetic LTV® 1200 homecare ventilator. Method: ER was measured on the Pulmonetic LTV® 1200 (LTV) homecare ventilator. The LTV was attached to the Hans Rudolph Electronic Breathing Simulator (HR 1101) using Pulmonetic’s non-heated circuit. Pressure and flow transducers (Hans Rudolph 4700 series) were calibrated using DT Foundry software and a Downs CPAP generator. Both transducers were placed before the <b>exhalation</b> <b>valve,</b> and ER was calculated using the equation (P 1 -P 2 /V). P 1 = pressure before the <b>exhalation</b> <b>valve,</b> P 2 = ambient pressure after the <b>exhalation</b> <b>valve,</b> and V = flow in liters per second. The ventilator was placed in volume A/C mode, frequency 12 breaths/minute, using tidal volumes (Vt) of 300, 500, 700, and 900 mL, ER was measured and recorded at each change. This process was repeated with set PEEP levels of 8, 11, and 14 cmH 2 O. Results: See Table 1. Conclusion: As expected, this study found that ER changed when Vt and PEEP were manipulated. The values for ER in this study are consistent with previous studies which reported ER values of 2. 1 – 159. 0 cmH 2 O/L/sec for modern intensive care ventilators. The apparent inconsistency of expiratory resistance values at Vt 500 ml and 900 ml was possibly due to a defect in sampling methods [...] insufficient time devoted to letting the LTV stabilize after adjusting Vt. Future studies should utilize a longer sampling period. Overall, additional studies are necessary to thoroughly evaluate expiratory resistance in the clinical setting since patient variables may also impact expiratory resistance...|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of patients, mainly COPD and overlap-syndrome patients, simultaneously use home oxygen therapy and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) at night. Usually the oxygen source is a stationary concentrator. We report a patient who, without a medical recommendation, was using a portable oxygen concentrator during nocturnal NIV. In the laboratory, with the patient, we tested the portable oxygen concentrator’s triggering and oxygen delivery, with the supplemental oxygen connected at 3 different positions: near the ventilator, near the <b>exhalation</b> <b>valve,</b> and on the nasal mask port. We also tested the concentrator’s triggering capacity by placing the nasal prongs and the nasal mask independently. We tested ventilator inspiratory pressures of 10, 14, and 18 cm H 2 O, and expiratory pressures of 4 and 6 cm H 2 O. The portable oxygen concentrator did not detect the patient’s inspiratory effort or deliver the required oxygen flow {{at any of the}} tested settings. We recommended that the patient not use the portable oxygen concentrator during nocturnal NIV. Key words: oxygen; pulse-dose portable oxygen concentrator; noninvasive ventilation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Current bilevel positive-pressure {{ventilators}} {{for home}} noninvasive ventilation (NIV) provide physicians with software that records items important for patient monitoring, such as compliance, tidal volume (Vt), and leaks. However, to our knowledge, {{the validity of}} this information {{has not yet been}} independently assessed. METHODS: Testing was done for seven home ventilators on a bench model adapted to simulate NIV and generate unintentional leaks (ie, other than of the mask <b>exhalation</b> <b>valve).</b> Five levels of leaks were simulated using a computer-driven solenoid valve (0 - 60 L/min) at different levels of inspiratory pressure (15 and 25 cm H(2) O) and at a fixed expiratory pressure (5 cm H(2) O), for a total of 10 conditions. Bench data were compared with results retrieved from ventilator software for leaks and Vt. RESULTS: For assessing leaks, three of the devices tested were highly reliable, with a small bias (0. 3 - 0. 9 L/min), narrow limits of agreement (LA), and high correlations (R(2), 0. 993 - 0. 997) when comparing ventilator software and bench results; conversely, for four ventilators, bias ranged from - 6. 0 L/min to - 25. 9 L/min, exceeding - 10 L/min for two devices, with wide LA and lower correlations (R(2), 0. 70 - 0. 98). Bias for leaks increased markedly with the importance of leaks in three devices. Vt was underestimated by all devices, and bias (range, 66 - 236 mL) increased with higher insufflation pressures. Only two devices had a bias < 100 mL, with all testing conditions considered. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians monitoring patients who use home ventilation must be aware of differences in the estimation of leaks and Vt by ventilator software. Also, leaks are reported in different ways according to the device used...|$|E

However, during exercise, with the increase of exhalation flow and respiratory rate and limited capability of PEV to exhale gases out of the circuit, it is still unknown whether CO 2 rebreathing occurs in COPD patients ventilated during exercise assisted by single-limb circuit with a PEV. A maximal symptom-limited cycle exercise test was performed while ventilated on pressure support (inspiratory:expiratory pressure 14 : 4 cmH 2 O) in 18 male patients with stable severe COPD (mean ± standard deviation, forced expiratory volume in 1 s: 29. 5 %± 6. 9 % predicted). At rest and during exercise, breathing pattern, mean expiratory flow, mean expiratory flow of PEV, and the mean inspiratory fraction of CO 2 (tidal fractional concentration of inspired CO 2 [FiCO 2]) reinsufflated from the circuit was measured for each breath. In comparison with rest, with the significant increase of mean expiratory flow (0. 39 ± 0. 15 vs 0. 82 ± 0. 27 L/s), fractional concentration of end-tidal CO 2 (2. 6 %± 0. 7 % vs 5. 5 %± 0. 6 %), and the significant decrease of mean expiratory flow of PEV (0. 41 ± 0. 02 vs 0. 39 ± 0. 03 L/s), tidal FiCO 2 significantly increased at peak exercise (0. 48 %± 0. 19 % vs 1. 8 %± 0. 6 %) in patients with stable severe COPD. The inflection point of obvious CO 2 rebreathing was 0. 67 ± 0. 09 L/s (95 % confidence interval 0. 60 – 0. 73 L/s). Ventilated by a single-limb tubing with PEV caused CO 2 rebreathing to COPD patients during exercise. Patients with mean expiratory flow > 0. 60 – 0. 73 L/s may be predisposed to a higher risk of CO 2 rebreathing.
