60|$|With {{this she}} turned and stepped quickly from the room. I followed, closing the <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|Making him as {{comfortable}} as possible on the bed, I left the room, locking the <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{went out}} and shut the <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and stood and thanked God {{from the bottom of}} my heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{show them}} to you--but not across this threshold. Let me enter, citizen proconsul, and close your {{sanctuary}} <b>doors</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> rather than before. What I have come hither to tell you, can only be said between four walls." ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>door</b> opened <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and {{the valet}} stood {{waiting on the}} threshold.|$|R
60|$|I {{was in the}} study, the <b>door</b> locked <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> {{before they}} could arrive at an understanding. I sprang to the window.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then go {{into that}} {{opposite}} room," [...] said she, pointing at the <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> with her withered hand, [...] "and wait there till I come." ...|$|E
6000|$|Minikin re-entered {{with papers}} in his hand. [...] "In you go," [...] he said. [...] "Heaven help you!" [...] And I passed in {{and closed the}} <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|I despised the {{emphatic}} growl at my back; only, being much vexed and upset, I {{regret to}} say that I slammed the <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> in a most undignified manner.|$|E
6000|$|Her eyes {{rested on}} {{me for a moment}} with a {{deepening}} expression of distrust, then looked away again. She began to turn pale. [...] "You are not like yourself to-night," [...] she said. Without a word more, she took her hat and cloak and went out before me into the square. I followed her, closing the <b>doors</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> She made an attempt to induce the child to approach her. [...] "Come, darling," [...] she said, enticingly--"come and take my hand." ...|$|R
60|$|A <b>door</b> opened softly <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> Naomi herself {{appeared}} on the threshold; Naomi herself answered my question.|$|R
60|$|She {{gave out}} another ringing peal, ran off {{into her own}} room, and slammed the <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> her, leaving <b>me</b> profoundly astounded. I stopped {{laughing}} at once.|$|R
60|$|When I {{got back}} to my room I locked the <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and went to sleep in the dark. I did not want light just then--could not bear it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There was no child,' said startled Anna. 'How should {{any child}} come in when I shut the <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> after I go out? All the keys of the flats are different.' ...|$|E
60|$|Once {{inside of}} Mr. Woodward's library, the {{merchant}} closed the <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> and then {{invited me to}} take a seat beside his desk, at the same time throwing himself back in his easy chair.|$|E
60|$|As the big <b>door</b> swung <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> I {{caught the}} echo of a roar of {{laughter}} that {{went up to the}} ceiling of the bank. Since then I bank no more. I keep my money in cash in my trousers pocket and my savings in silver dollars in a sock.|$|R
60|$|After this {{no other}} Fung {{appeared}} upon the wall, so I turned {{my attention to}} the spy-hole in the <b>doors</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and seeing some horsemen moving about {{at a distance of}} four or five hundred yards on a rocky ridge where the mist did not lie, I opened fire on them and at the second shot was fortunate enough to knock a man out of the saddle. One of those with him, who must have been a brave fellow, instantly jumped down, threw him, dead or living, over the horse, leaped up behind him, and galloped away accompanied by the others, pursued by some probably ineffective bullets that I sent after them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I will go by all means," [...] I answered: and I {{was glad}} of the {{unexpected}} opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity. I {{slipped out of}} the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and I closed the <b>door</b> quietly <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Me dear," [...] {{answered}} the O'Kelly, snatching his pipe {{from his mouth}} and thrusting it, still alight, into his trousers pocket. I made {{the rest of the}} descent by myself, and slipping out, closed the <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> as noiselessly as possible.|$|E
60|$|I Left the house, {{feeling that}} Mrs. Catherick had helped me a step forward, {{in spite of}} herself. Before I had reached the turning which led out of the square, my {{attention}} was suddenly aroused {{by the sound of}} a closing <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Take {{your own}} time. There is no hurry. I dare {{say you will}} find there all you may want. I shall remain on the terrace until you summon me." [...] With that I {{went out on the}} terrace, drawing close the glass <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{had barely}} passed the threshold, before the <b>door</b> was closed <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> I heard the selfish old brute rub his hands, and chuckle over {{his success in}} {{shutting}} me and my sorrow both {{out of the room}} together.|$|R
6000|$|It is {{needless to}} dwell upon the {{sensation}} this discovery gave me; happily I was {{within a few}} yards of the committee-rooms, and into these I dashed, closing and bolting the <b>doors</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and mounting the stairs like a flash. The committee was in solemn session, sitting in a nice, even row on the front benches, each man with his elbows on his knees, and his chin resting in the palms of his hands--thinking. At each man's feet lay a neglected copy of the Bugle. Every member fixed his eyes on me, but no one stirred, none uttered a sound. There was something awful in this preternatural silence, made more impressive by the hoarse murmur of the crowd outside, breaking down the door. I could endure it no longer, but strode forward and snatched up the paper lying {{at the feet of}} the chairman. At the head of the editorial columns, in letters half an inch long, were the following amazing head-lines: ...|$|R
60|$|I found Mabane and Arthur alone, {{for which}} I was {{sufficiently}} thankful. There {{was no longer}} any excuse for delay. Mabane had taken possession of the easy-chair, and was smoking his largest pipe. Arthur was walking restlessly {{up and down the}} room. Evidently they had been discussing between them the events of the afternoon, for there was a sudden silence when I entered, and they both waited eagerly for me to speak. I closed the <b>door</b> carefully <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and took a cigarette from the box on my desk.|$|R
60|$|She was blazing with {{eagerness to}} see one of those already celebrated murderers, and she started on the errand at once. I slipped out the back way, locked the <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> put the key in my pocket and started off, chuckling to myself and comfortable.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{answered}} by a waiter--a mere lad. As {{the light in}} the passage fell on my face, he paused in the act of addressing me, and drew back a few steps. Without stopping for any explanations, I closed the <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and said to him at once: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{it shall}} be just as you like. Now try and get to sleep again. I shall leave you {{for an hour or}} two, and send off Phoebe, and then bring you some breakfast. I'll lock the <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> so that the girl mayn't come in by chance.' ...|$|E
60|$|When the sea-green {{curtains}} were closed, {{and when}} the two baize <b>doors</b> were shut <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> I {{stopped for a moment}} in the little circular hall beyond, and drew a long, luxurious breath of relief. It was like coming {{to the surface of the}} water after deep diving, to find myself once more on the outside of Mr. Fairlie's room.|$|R
6000|$|... "I tapped at {{the door}} as agreed. Lucas opened it. I {{followed}} him into his room, leaving the hall <b>door</b> ajar <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> for I feared {{to be alone with}} the man. I remember that there was a woman outside as I entered. Our business was soon done. He had my letter on his desk, I handed him the document. He gave me the letter. At this instant there was a sound {{at the door}}. There were steps in the passage. Lucas quickly turned back the drugget, thrust the document into some hiding-place there, and covered it over.|$|R
50|$|Knight {{has written}} {{that this was the}} first of his stories that he {{considered}} to be of professional quality. He said that the idea for the storycame to me during the time it took for a men's-room <b>door</b> to close <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> in a Swedish restaurant in New York. I didn't have the characters or the setting, but I had the whole structure; all I needed was to find parts that fit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Almost before I knew it I was {{standing}} inside {{and the old}} woman, muttering to herself, had closed the <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> With a queer sensation of being trapped I followed my host into the room, and taking the proffered chair warmed my frozen fingers at the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "In the {{capacity}} of Oscar's friend," [...] I answered. [...] "You will get rid of us both to-morrow." [...] I banged the <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and went up-stairs. If I had been Mr. Finch's wife, I believe I should have ended in making quite an agreeable man of him.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he stepped}} outside quickly, and I {{followed}} his example, closing the <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> lest father {{should attempt to}} say something {{in the nature of}} a farewell, which I knew would unnerve me, because I believed it was exceedingly dangerous for any of our party to move around the city.|$|E
2500|$|The first metaphorical {{usage of}} [...] "iron curtain", {{in the sense}} of an end of an era, perhaps should be {{attributed}} to British author Arthur Machen (1863–1947), who used the term in his 1895 novel The Three Impostors: [...] " [...] [...] [...] the <b>door</b> clanged <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> with the noise of thunder, and I felt that an iron curtain had fallen on the brief passage of my life". It is interesting to note the English translation of a Russian text shown immediately below repeats the use of [...] "clang" [...] with reference to an [...] "iron curtain", suggesting that the Russian writer, publishing 23 years after Machen, may have been familiar with the popular British author.|$|R
5000|$|Speed {{decided to}} leave the soap once again in 2004. She commented [...] "I'd been back for five years and had very little to do the year before. I quite like being busy and I could see the scriptwriters were {{struggling}} with Natalie and where to place her so it seemed like the right time to go. It's nice that they've left it open, I'd hate to think the <b>door</b> was shut <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> Absolutely, I'd like to go back, never say never.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Off-screen actress Lucy Speed {{had decided}} to quit the role after six years playing Natalie. She {{comments}} “'I'd been back {{for five years and}} had very little to do the year before. I quite like being busy and I could see the scriptwriters were struggling with Natalie and where to place her so it seemed like the right time to go. It's nice that they've left it open, I'd hate to think the <b>door</b> was shut <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> Absolutely, I'd like to go back, never say never. Maybe I'll track Janine down.” ...|$|R
