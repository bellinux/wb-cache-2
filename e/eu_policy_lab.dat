40|$|The {{workshop}} “Visions for the World in 2035 ” was organised in the <b>EU</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Lab</b> by the Foresight and Behavioural Insights Unit {{in collaboration}} with the European Development Days (EDD 15). It hosted 15 Future Leaders between the ages of 21 and 26 who were selected by the EDD 15 organisers {{from around the world to}} join the debate on development policy and international cooperation. The purpose of the workshop was 1) to introduce the Future Leaders to systemic and long-term strategic thinking, 2) to help them formulate a vision broadly related to their area of activity and thus boost their contribution to the upcoming EDD 15 debates, and 3) to foster their positioning as agents of positive change in the coming decades. Through group vision building, plenary discussions and individual pitches, participants shared their experiences, explored megatrends that are likely to shape different possible futures and challenged present assumptions related to social change, youth and development. The aim of the report is to present our insights from the preparation and running of the workshop in order to revise different methods and techniques used and adapted in the context of the <b>EU</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Lab.</b> This type of an event could be further adapted and replicated in other research and policy contexts.

40|$|Policy Labs are {{emerging}} structures that construct public policies in an innovative, design-oriented fashion, in particular by engaging citizens and companies {{working within the}} public sector. Currently, a number of Policy Labs exist {{in a handful of}} Member States of the European Union. Interest stemming from administrations and government organizations in other Member States indicate the objective to create a Lab, many of whom have a desire to build upon the experience and best practices of their peers. The <b>EU</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Lab</b> at the European Commission's Joint Research Centre wishes to enable such collaboration and commissioned the creation of a map of Policy Labs in the European Union by Conseil & Recherche and the 27 e Région. This map and report enables the first step of that process by identifying 'who works on what?' at the local, regional, and national levels of government. It is intended to be a living document which can evolve and expand over time to reflect the progress, diversity, and evolution of Policy Labs in Europe. JRC.

40|$|As a new {{generation}} of spaces, Policy Labs are putting in practice experimental thinking and coming up with out-of-the-box solutions that can induce positive change. Apart from their differences in mandate, methods and affiliation, Labs are going for open, bottom-up or citizen-led processes, characterized by intense idea brainstorming, problem reframing, early needs assessment, co-creation, prototyping and testing before large scale deployment. A number of Labs have popped up, from MindLab in Denmark, La 27 eme Region in France or LabX in Portugal (just to name a few in Europe), and even {{at the heart of the}} European Commission (<b>EU</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Lab).</b> Within the current panorama, Lab practitioners and the "converted" underline experimentation's added value in spurring innovation in policy-making. The most innovative ideas don't arise from closed settings, but instead in real-life contexts or hybrid spaces with freedom to collaborate with others and try out risky processes. But just how far Labs have gone in implementing this narrative? What are the most pressing gaps to address for the near future when looking for success and scalability?JRC.

40|$|The <b>EU</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Lab</b> at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission (EC) {{organised}} {{a one-day}} workshop to pilot a foresight policy-engagement tool {{based on a}} set of global megatrends. The workshop was also used to gather the experience and good practice of foresight practitioners in engaging policy-makers and other stakeholders in long-term and systems-thinking processes. The workshop was held on 18 November 2016, at the EC premises, Rue Science 29, Brussels, Belgium, This report documents and illustrates the activities that took place during the workshop, taking stock of the results to support further development of the FOR-KNOW project, which aims to establish a repository of megatrends and a tool for using such trends in policy-making mainly at European level. As such, it does not describe all the insights captured during the workshop, Content gathered during the workshop will be further developed and ultimately feed the online format of the FOR-KNOW repository and other dissemination products of the project. The first section provides information about the JRC, the project itself and its policy context. The second and third sections present the workshop purpose, participants and an illustrated guide to the workshop process including the participants' feedback before we conclude in section four. JRC.

40|$|This paper reviews {{evidence}} {{on the impact of}} <b>EU</b> <b>policies</b> on global food security, focusing on four <b>EU</b> <b>policy</b> areas: agricultural policy, bioenergy policy, trade policy, and development (food aid) policy. Old concerns related to the detrimental impact of EU farm subsidies, food aid and tariffs on poor countries’ food security. New concerns relate to impacts of EU food standards and bioenergy <b>policies.</b> The <b>EU</b> <b>policies</b> which created the largest distortions on global markets (in the area of trade, agriculture, food aid, and bioenergy) have been substantially reformed over the past decades. Recent global food price fluctuations have also re-emphasized that the impact of <b>EU</b> <b>policies</b> on the poor’s food security differ depending on whether these are consumers or producers, or whether countries are exporters or importers. Overall, our review explains that in many areas the impact of <b>EU</b> <b>policies</b> on global food security is less obvious and more complex than often argued. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} current <b>EU</b> <b>policy</b> {{framework}} {{in view of}} its impact on hydrogen and fuel cell development. It screens <b>EU</b> energy <b>policies,</b> <b>EU</b> regulatory <b>policies</b> and <b>EU</b> spending <b>policies.</b> Key questions addressed are as follows: To what extent is the current policy framework conducive to hydrogen and fuel cell development? What barriers and inconsistencies can be identified? How can policies potentially promote hydrogen and fuel cells in Europe, {{taking into account the}} complex evolution of such a disruptive technology? How should the <b>EU</b> <b>policy</b> framework be reformed in view of a strengthened and more coherent approach? The paper concludes that the current <b>EU</b> <b>policy</b> framework does not hinder hydrogen development. Yet it does not constitute a strong push factor either. <b>EU</b> energy <b>policies</b> have the strongest impact on hydrogen and fuel cell development even though their potential is still underexploited. Regulatory policies have a weak but positive impact on hydrogen. <b>EU</b> spending <b>policies</b> show some inconsistencies. However, the large scale market development of hydrogen and fuel cells will require a new policy approach which comprises technology specific support as well as a supportive policy framework with a special regional dimension...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the <b>EU’s</b> <b>policy</b> on {{irregular}} immigration. At {{the centre of}} the inquiry is the externally-oriented and externalizing approach to irregular immigration that has been adopted in the EU and the predominant use of external measures in the <b>EU’s</b> <b>policy</b> to deal with irregular immigration at the cost of internal and protective measures. The <b>EU’s</b> <b>policy</b> is questioned as the external measures that the EU has adopted are shown to be both ineffective in actually preventing irregular migrants from entering Europe and detrimental to the safety and human rights of irregular migrants and asylum-seekers. While the internal and protective measures are lacking in the <b>EU’s</b> <b>policy,</b> it also seems that the EU treats the considerable challenges that occur within Europe, and which are estimated to involve several million people, with a complete ambivalence. In explaining the <b>EU’s</b> <b>policy</b> on irregular immigration the vertical and horizontal venue-shopping theory is tested in the thesis. This subsequently opens up further questions regarding the national approaches to irregular immigration in the member states...|$|R

40|$|The European Union's (EU) {{management}} of globalization includes redistributing or compensating for distributional consequences of globalization, using policies {{at different levels}} of governance (national, regional-European and supra-European). This contribution analyzes the extent and politics of such redistributive management. It emphasizes how redistributive management is meaningful and very popular, though less developed than <b>EU</b> <b>policies</b> setting the level and terms of openness. In addition, it suggests how <b>EU</b> <b>policies</b> that manage globalization through redistribution or other mechanisms and that operate {{at different levels of}} governance are causally interconnected. Existing national and <b>EU</b> <b>policies</b> of redistribution have strong but uneven effects for EU protections setting the level of openness. And national-level welfare provisions and <b>EU</b> redistributive <b>policies,</b> like the Structural Funds, sometimes undermine and sometimes reinforce one another. Case examples and analysis of public opinion develop these claims...|$|R
