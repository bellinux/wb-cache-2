40|$|Abstract: Piracetam was {{subjected}} to the hydrolytic, oxidative, thermal and photolytic stress, according to ICH guideline Q 1 A (R 2). The drug depicted degradation only in basic conditions, while it was stable to other stress conditions (acidic, neutral hydrolysis, thermal and photolytic conditions). A total of one <b>degradation</b> <b>product</b> was formed, which were separated on a BEH column employing an isocratic UPLC method. The <b>degradation</b> <b>product</b> was isolated and characterizes using UPLC-MS/MS, 1 H NMR and IR. Initially, a total mass fragmentation pathway of the drug was established {{with the help of}} UPLC-MS/TOF studies. Subsequently, the isolated <b>degradation</b> <b>product</b> {{was subjected}} to MS/TOF mass studies to achieve their accurate mass, fragment pattern. The MS results helped to ascribe tentative structures to <b>degradation</b> <b>product,</b> which were verified through 1 H NMR and IR. Based on the results, a complete degradation pathway for the drug has been proposed...|$|R
40|$|Two {{simple and}} {{accurate}} methods were developed for quantitative estimation of cefoxitin sodium in presence of its open ring alkali-induced <b>degradation</b> <b>product.</b> The first method {{was based on}} TLC separation of the drug from its alkali-induced <b>degradation</b> <b>product</b> followed by densitometric measurement of the intact drug at 254 Â nm.

25|$|Anthocyanins {{are thought}} to be subject to physiochemical {{degradation}} in vivo and in vitro. Structure, pH, temperature, light, oxygen, metal ions, intramolecular association, and intermolecular association with other compounds (copigments, sugars, proteins, <b>degradation</b> <b>products,</b> etc.) generally are known to affect the color and stability of anthocyanins. B-ring hydroxylation status and pH have been shown to mediate the degradation of anthocyanins to their phenolic acid and aldehyde constituents. Indeed, significant portions of ingested anthocyanins are likely to degrade to phenolic acids and aldehyde in vivo, following consumption. This characteristic confounds scientific isolation of specific anthocyanin mechanisms in vivo.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though all}} {{elements}} in a bioresorbable metal may themselves be considered biocompatible, the morphology and elemental makeup (or combination of elements) of the <b>degradation</b> <b>products</b> may cause adverse reactions in the body. In addition, the rapid evolution of hydrogen gas that is concomitant with Mg-alloy degradation may cause addition problems in vivo. It is therefore crucial to intricately understand the corrosion of each implant and the products that are release, {{in light of their}} toxicity and the likelihood of inflammation. The majority of studies in the literature have focused on elements that are known to be biocompatible or abundant in the body, such as calcium and zinc.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} phase III {{clinical}} trials are reached, {{the formulation of}} the drug should {{have been developed to}} be close to the preparation that will ultimately be used in the market. A knowledge of stability is essential by this stage, and conditions must have been developed to ensure that the drug is stable in the preparation. If the drug proves unstable, it will invalidate the results from clinical trials since {{it would be impossible to}} know what the administered dose actually was. Stability studies are carried out to test whether temperature, humidity, oxidation, or photolysis (ultraviolet light or visible light) have any effect, and the preparation is analysed to see if any <b>degradation</b> <b>products</b> have been formed.|$|E

25|$|Under homeostatic conditions, {{the body}} is {{maintained}} in a finely tuned balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis. The activation of the coagulation cascade yields thrombin that converts fibrinogen to fibrin; the stable fibrin clot being the final product of hemostasis. The fibrinolytic system then functions to break down fibrinogen and fibrin. Activation of the fibrinolytic system generates plasmin (in the presence of thrombin), {{which is responsible for}} the lysis of fibrin clots. The breakdown of fibrinogen and fibrin results in polypeptides called fibrin <b>degradation</b> <b>products</b> (FDPs) or fibrin split products (FSPs). In a state of homeostasis, the presence of plasmin is critical, as it is the central proteolytic enzyme of coagulation and is also necessary for the breakdown of clots, or fibrinolysis.|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} polysaccharides {{have been found}} in the {{extracellular}} and intracellular compartments of M. plumbeus including fucose, glucose, galactose and mannose. Glucuronic acid, a carbohydrate with a similar structure to glucose, is located specifically in the extracellular region of M. plumbeus. The monosaccharide glucosamine was found only in the intracellular regions of M. plumbeus. Mucor plumbeus has the ability to detoxify pentachlorophenol and has been used in the biotransformation of other products. Incubation of M. plumbeus with the natural product maalioxide produces three metabolites (1,7 and 9 β-hydroxymaalioxide). Mucor plumbeus activity towards camphorquinone is stereoselective. Extracts of Mucor plumbeus have shown acetylcholinesterase enzyme inhibition activity. Mucor plumbeus is able to biocatalyze the hydroxylation of terpenes and steroids by cytochrome p450 enzymes in the presence of O and cofactor NADPH. Mucor plumbeus also transforms sesquiterpene into a series of 12 <b>degradation</b> <b>products</b> of 10,15-epoxidation. As well, squamulosone (aromadendr-1(10)-en-9-one) is biotransformed by M. plumbeus to yield an array of terpenes.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of these <b>degradation</b> <b>products</b> in the fuel tank, fuel lines plus a carburetor or fuel injection components {{makes it harder to}} start the engine or causes reduced engine performance. On resumption of regular engine use, the buildup {{may or may not be}} eventually cleaned out by the flow of fresh gasoline. The addition of a fuel stabilizer to gasoline can extend the life of fuel that is not or cannot be stored properly though removal of all fuel from a fuel system is the only real solution to the problem of long term storage of an engine or a machine or vehicle. Some typical fuel stabilizers are proprietary mixtures containing mineral spirits, isopropyl alcohol, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, or other additives. Fuel stabilizer is commonly used for small engines, such as lawnmower and tractor engines, especially when their use is seasonal (low to no use for one or more seasons of the year). Users have been advised to keep gasoline containers more than half full and properly capped to reduce air exposure, to avoid storage at high temperatures, to run an engine for ten minutes to circulate the stabilizer through all components prior to storage, and to run the engine at intervals to purge stale fuel from the carburetor.|$|E

25|$|Hyaluronic acid (HA) is {{a widely}} used {{biomaterial}} {{as a result of}} its excellent biocompatibility and its physiologic function diversity. It is abundant in the extracellular matrix (ECM) where it binds large glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans through specific HA-protein interactions. HA also binds cell surface receptors such as CD44, which results in the activation of intracellular signaling cascades that regulate cell adhesion and motility and promote proliferation and differentiation. HA is also known to support angiogenesis because its <b>degradation</b> <b>products</b> stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Thus, HA plays a pivotal role in maintaining the normal processes necessary for tissue survival. Unmodified HA has been used in clinical applications such as ocular surgery, wound healing, and plastic surgery. HA can be crosslinked to form hydrogels. HA hydrogels that were either unmodified or modified with laminin were implanted into an adult central nervous system lesion and tested for their ability to induce neural tissue formation in a study by Hou et al.. They demonstrated the ability to support cell ingrowth and angiogenesis, in addition to inhibiting glial scar formation. Also, the HA hydrogels modified with laminin were able to promote neurite extension. These results support HA gels as a promising biomaterial for a nerve guidance conduit.|$|E
500|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} {{the most common form of}} dementia, and studies have shown that {{manipulation}} of pathways involving LRP8/ApoER2 can lead to the disease.
