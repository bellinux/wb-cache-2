25|$|In {{the case}} of {{centrifugal}} compressors, commercial designs currently do not exceed a compression ratio {{of more than a}} 3.5 to 1 in any one stage (for a typical gas). Since compression raises the temperature, the compressed gas is to be cooled between stages making the compression less adiabatic and more isothermal. The <b>inter-stage</b> coolers typically result in some partial condensation that is removed in vapor-liquid separators.|$|E
25|$|The airfoil {{profiles}} are optimized and matched {{for specific}} velocities and turning. Although compressors can be run at other conditions with different flows, speeds, or pressure ratios, this {{can result in}} an efficiency penalty or even a partial or complete breakdown in flow (known as compressor stall and pressure surge respectively). Thus, a practical limit {{on the number of}} stages, and the overall pressure ratio, comes from the interaction of the different stages when required to work away from the design conditions. These “off-design” conditions can be mitigated to a certain extent by providing some flexibility in the compressor. This is achieved normally through the use of adjustable stators or with valves that can bleed fluid from the main flow between stages (<b>inter-stage</b> bleed).|$|E
25|$|Isothermal - This model {{assumes that}} the {{compressed}} gas remains at a constant temperature throughout the compression or expansion process. In this cycle, internal energy {{is removed from the}} system as heat at the same rate that it is added by the mechanical work of compression. Isothermal compression or expansion more closely models real life when the compressor has a large heat exchanging surface, a small gas volume, or a long time scale (i.e., a small power level). Compressors that utilize <b>inter-stage</b> cooling between compression stages come closest to achieving perfect isothermal compression. However, with practical devices perfect isothermal compression is not attainable. For example, unless you have an infinite number of compression stages with corresponding intercoolers, you will never achieve perfect isothermal compression.|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the European Space Agency funded program VECEP, aimed at further increasing the performance of the VEGA launcher, a vibro-acoustic analysis, driven by the acoustic field generated at lift-off, is performed on the VEGA <b>Inter-stages.</b> The <b>Inter-stages</b> are examined to derive the acceleration level at the equipment locations and the average vibration response of the connecting interfaces. Due to high modal density of the structure, a random noise and vibration analysis through deterministic methods, e. g. based on Finite Element/Boundary Element techniques, turns out to be unfeasible in a medium to high frequency range. Conversely, the employment of a fully energy based approach in such frequency range is restricted by the need to simulate the equipment as lumped masses, connected to the main structure throughout rigid links. A Hybrid method is thus adopted to combine the equipment local deterministic responses with the mean value of the dynamic response of the launcher mayor sections. The implemented analysis resorts to a FEM solver to extract the modal parameters associated to the deterministic subsystems of the VEGA <b>Inter-stages.</b> The development of the statistical subsystems and the set-up of the global hybrid models are realised within a numerical environment, formerly devoted to SEA methodology only, in which the required dynamic analysis is also performed. The structural and acoustic models of the <b>Inter-stages</b> are validated through comparison with theoretical and numerical estimates. As required for the assessment of the equipment qualification status, the activity is finalized with the delivery of the dynamic response database, numerically generated by applying a stochastic diffuse field to the <b>Inter-stages</b> validated models...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{conventional}} {{fossil fuel}} power plants, SOx and NOx are removed via flue gas desulfurization units (FGDs) and selective catalytic or non-catalytic reduction units (SCRs and NSCRs) or by other processes, which increase CAPEX and OPEX of the plant. Oxy-fuel combustion with CO 2 capture and compression provides new means for efficient removal of these pollutants. This is done within the compression and cooling <b>inter-stages</b> of the CO 2 capture unit, hence {{eliminating the need for}} upstream FGDs and SCRs. This paper provides the preliminary results from a test campaign carried out at CanmetENERGY's 0. 3 MWthermal integrated oxy-fuel research facility.

40|$|Background: Associating liver {{partition}} and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) was recently developed to induce rapid hypertrophy and reduce post-hepatectomy liver failure {{in patients with}} insufficient remnant liver volume (RLV). However, mortality rates > 12 % have been reported. This study aimed to analyze the perioperative course of ALPPS and to identify factors associated with morbi-mortality. Methods: Between April 2011 and September 2013, 62 patients operated in 9 Franco-Belgian hepatobiliary centres underwent ALPPS for colorectal metastases (N = 50) or primary tumors, following chemotherapy (N = 50) and/or portal vein embolization (PVE; N = 9). Results: Most patients had right (N = 31) or right extended hepatectomy (N = 25) (median RLV/body weight ratio of 0. 54 % [0. 21 - 0. 77 %]). RLV increased by 48. 6 % [- 15. 3 to 192 %] 7. 8 ± 4. 5 days after stage 1, but the hypertrophy decelerated beyond 7 days. Stage 2 was cancelled in 3 patients (4. 8 %) for insufficient hypertrophy, portal vein thrombosis or death and delayed to 9 days in 32 (54. 2 %). Overall, 25 patients (40. 3 %) had major complication(s) and 8 (12. 9 %) died. Fourteen patients (22. 6 %) had post-stage 1 complication of whom 5 (35. 7 %) died after stage 2. Factors associated with major morbi-mortality were obesity, post-stage 1 biliary fistula or ascites, and infected and/or bilious peritoneal fluid at stage 2. The latter was the only predictor of Clavien ≥ 3 by multivariate analysis (OR: 4. 9; 95 % CI: 1. 227 - 19. 97; p = 0. 025). PVE did not impact the morbi-mortality rates but prevented major cytolysis that was associated with poor outcome. Conclusions: The <b>inter-stages</b> course was crucial in determining ALPPS outcome. The factors of high morbi-mortality rates associated with ALPPS {{are linked to the}} technique complexity. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
25|$|If {{the water}} {{in direct contact with}} the {{pressure}} transfer mechanism (diaphragm or piston and the spring balancing the internal pressure) of the regulator freezes, the mechanism will be locked in the position at which the freezing takes place, as the ice will prevent the movement required to close. Since the cooling takes place during flow through the regulator, it is common for the freezing to occur when the first stage valve is open, and this will freeze the valve open, allowing a continuous flow through the first stage. This will cause the <b>inter-stage</b> pressure to rise until the second stage opens to relieve the excess pressure, the pressure relief valve on the first stage opens, or a low pressure hose or fitting bursts. All of these effects will allow the flow through the first stage to continue, so the cooling will continue, and this will keep the ice causing the problem frozen. To break the cycle it is necessary to stop the gas flow or expose the ice to a heat source capable of melting it. While underwater, it is unlikely to find a heat source to thaw the ice and stopping the flow is only option. Clearly the flow will stop when the pressure in the cylinder drops to ambient, but this is undesirable as it means total loss of the breathing gas. The other option is to close the cylinder valve, shutting off the pressure at the source. Once this is done, the ice will normally melt as heat from the surrounding water is absorbed by the slightly colder ice, and once the ice has melted, the regulator will function again.|$|E

40|$|The work {{performed}} in 2013 by the X-TRAS (Expertise Raumtransportsysteme) group of DLR {{on the critical}} analysis of the Ariane 6 PPH architecture is presented in this report. A first design iteration loop has been performed, based on the Ariane 6 configuration of the Concept Selection Key Point (triangular positioning of the three P 135 of the first stage). A preliminary model of the launcher with three P 135 solid rocket motors (SRM) in the first stage, one identical P 135 solid rocket motor in the second stage and a H 30 cryogenic stage powered by Vinci was established. Subsequently, specific areas were analysed in more detail. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) calculations have been performed to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of the launcher and to validate the aerodynamic database obtained with engineering method and, used for trajectory optimisation. Numerous parameters of the P 135 solid rocket motors (amongst others performance, internal flow, pressure and thrust oscillations, and heat transfer) have been analysed and a preliminary design of the casing, the nozzle, the igniter and the grain have been performed. Using finite element methods, the main structure of the launch vehicle including the solid rocket motor casing, the <b>inter-stages</b> and the upper stage have been sized. In addition the stiffness was adapted to guarantee that the lower natural frequencies of the launch vehicle are high enough to ensure the launcher’s stability and controllability in flight. The propellant feed system of the upper stage has been pre-sized for the reference GTO-DDO (direct de-orbiting) mission. Sloshing in the tanks has been calculated with CFD methods. A preliminary selection of the subsystems was performed based on existing launch vehicles. The controllability and stability of the launch vehicle has been verified {{under the influence of}} wind gusts for the configuration of Ariane 6 LS-PRR, linear positioning of the three P 135 of the first stage (October 2013). The case of thrust asymmetry, due to different burning rate of the solid rocket motors of the first stage, was also considered. Preliminary analyses of the de-orbitation and launcher visibility from ground stations during its ascent were also performed. Based on all these results a new mass breakdown and flight sequence was established and the optimal GTO trajectory determined.

50|$|Two {{immiscible}} liquids {{of different}} densities are fed to the separate inlets and are rapidly mixed in the annular {{space between the}} spinning rotor and stationary housing.

50|$|In {{the middle}} of 1952 the cars were {{substantially}} rebuilt, including better cooling - most notably a greatly enlarged radiator aperture in the nose, better ventilation, and repositioning of the exhaust pipe stubs. The car had been deliberately designed with a low seating position, but Fangio, asked what changes he would like on the car, replied that amongst other things he would like a little higher seat, as he liked to see where he was going. The car was modified to Fangio's request and he drove the car intermittently throughout 1953. He later {{said that it was}} the most formidable car he ever drove during his career.

50|$|The two {{injector}} {{regions are}} each designed to efficiently transfer its namesake carriers (electrons or holes) from the semimetallic interface to the active region. They must also double as rectifying barriers for the opposite type of carrier {{in order to}} prevent <b>inter-stage</b> leakage currents. The total injector (electron injector plus hole injector) should also be sufficiently thick overall to prevent the electric fields forming under bias from becoming great enough to induce dielectric breakdown of the material. The electron injector is usually made longer because of the relatively fast inter-well scattering rate of electrons compared to that of holes. This ensures a smaller series resistance contribution from the total injector transport. The hole injector is composed of GaSb/AlSb quantum wells. It is made just thick enough (typically with just one or two wells) to ensure effective suppression of electron tunneling from the active region to the electron injector of the next stage. The electron injector typically consists of a longer series of InAs/AlSb quantum wells. To maximize the InAs/AlSb superlattice miniband width, the InAs layer thicknesses are varied across the injector so that their ground state energies nearly align when the device is biased. The quantum well energy gaps in the injector must be large enough to preclude reabsorption of the photons generated by the active quantum wells.|$|E

50|$|The {{increase}} in pressure produced by a single stage {{is limited by the}} relative velocity between the rotor and the fluid, and the turning and diffusion capabilities of the airfoils. A typical stage in a commercial compressor will produce a pressure increase of between 15% and 60% (pressure ratios of 1.15-1.6) at design conditions with a polytropic efficiency in the region of 90-95%. To achieve different pressure ratios, axial compressors are designed with different numbers of stages and rotational speeds. As a rule of thumb we can assume that each stage in a given compressor has the same temperature rise (Delta T). Therefore, at the entry, temperature (Tstage) to each stage must increase progressively through the compressor and the ratio (Delta T)/(Tstage) entry must decrease, thus implying a progressive reduction in stage pressure ratio through the unit. Hence the rear stage develops a significantly lower pressure ratio than the first stage.Higher stage pressure ratios are also possible if the relative velocity between fluid and rotors is supersonic, but this is achieved at the expense of efficiency and operability. Such compressors, with stage pressure ratios of over 2, are only used where minimizing the compressor size, weight or complexity is critical, such as in military jets.The airfoil profiles are optimized and matched for specific velocities and turning. Although compressors can be run at other conditions with different flows, speeds, or pressure ratios, this can result in an efficiency penalty or even a partial or complete breakdown in flow (known as compressor stall and pressure surge respectively). Thus, a practical limit on the number of stages, and the overall pressure ratio, comes from the interaction of the different stages when required to work away from the design conditions. These “off-design” conditions can be mitigated to a certain extent by providing some flexibility in the compressor. This is achieved normally through the use of adjustable stators or with valves that can bleed fluid from the main flow between stages (<b>inter-stage</b> bleed).Modern jet engines use a series of compressors, running at different speeds; to supply air at around 40:1 pressure ratio for combustion with sufficient flexibility for all flight conditions.|$|E
