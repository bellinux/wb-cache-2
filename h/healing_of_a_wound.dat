60|$|The {{units of}} the body are {{generally}} admitted by physiologists to be autonomous. I go one step further and assume that they throw off reproductive gemmules. Thus an organism does not generate its kind as a whole, but each separate unit generates its kind. It has often been said by naturalists that each cell of a plant has the potential capacity of reproducing the whole plant; but it has this power only in virtue of containing gemmules derived from every part. When a cell or unit is from some cause modified, the gemmules derived from {{it will be in}} like manner modified. If our hypothesis be provisionally accepted, we must look at all the forms of asexual reproduction, whether occurring at maturity or during youth, as fundamentally the same, and dependent on the mutual aggregation and multiplication of the gemmules. The regrowth of an amputated limb and the <b>healing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wound</b> is the same process partially carried out. Buds apparently include nascent cells, belonging to that stage of development at which the budding occurs, and these cells are ready to unite with the gemmules derived from the next succeeding cells. The sexual elements, on the other hand, do not include such nascent cells; and the male and female elements taken separately do not contain a sufficient number of gemmules for independent development, except in the cases of parthenogenesis. The development of each being, including all the forms of metamorphosis and metagenesis, depends on the presence of gemmules thrown off at each period of life, and on their development, at a corresponding period, in union with preceding cells. Such cells may be said to be fertilised by the gemmules which come next in due order of development. Thus the act of ordinary impregnation and the development of each part in each being are closely analogous processes. The child, strictly speaking, does not grow into the man, but includes germs which slowly and successively become developed and form the man. In the child, {{as well as in the}} adult, each part generates the same part. Inheritance must be looked at as merely a form of growth, like the self- division of a lowly-organised unicellular organism. Reversion depends on the transmission from the forefather to his descendants of dormant gemmules, which occasionally become developed under certain known or unknown conditions. Each animal and plant may be compared with a bed of soil full of seeds, some of which soon germinate, some lie dormant for a period, whilst others perish. When we hear it said that a man carries in his constitution the seeds of an inherited disease, there is much truth in the expression. No other attempt, as far as I am aware, has been made, imperfect as this confessedly is, to connect under one point of view these several grand classes of facts. An organic being is a microcosm--a little universe, formed of a host of self-propagating organisms, inconceivably minute and numerous as the stars in heaven.|$|E

5000|$|Clot {{formation}} - Once the platelet plug {{has been}} {{formed by the}} platelets, the clotting factors (a dozen proteins that travel along the blood plasma in an inactive state) are activated in a sequence of events known as 'coagulation cascade' {{which leads to the}} formation of Fibrin from inactive fibrinogen plasma protein. Thus, a Fibrin mesh is produced all around the platelet plug to hold it in place; this step is called [...] "Secondary Hemostasis". During this process some red and white blood cells are trapped in the mesh which causes the primary hemostasis plug to become harder: the resultant plug is called as 'thrombus' or 'Clot'. Therefore 'blood clot' contains secondary hemostasis plug with blood cells trapped in it. Though this is often a good step for wound healing, it has the ability to cause severe health problems if the thrombus becomes detached from the vessel wall and travels through the circulatory system; If it reaches the brain, heart or lungs it could lead to stroke, heart attack, or pulmonary embolism respectively.

Thus, transgene expression was observed in the developing placenta and embryonic cardiovascular, skeletal, and central and peripheral nervous systems. The sites of transgene expression {{are consistent with those}} observed of the endogenous Cyr 61 gene as determined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The transgene expression in the cardiovascular system does not require the serum response element, a promoter sequence essential for transcriptional activation of Cyr 61 by serum growth factors in cultured fibroblasts. Because the serum response element contains the CArG box, a sequence element implicated in cardiovascular-specific gene expression, the nonessential nature of this sequence for cardiovascular expression of Cyr 61 is unexpected. Furthermore, the Cyr 61 promoter-driven lacZ expression is inducible in granulation tissue during wound healing, as is synthesis of the endogenous Cyr 61 protein, suggesting a role for Cyr 61 in wound healing. Consistent with this finding, purified Cyr 61 protein promotes the <b>healing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wounded</b> fibroblast monolayer in culture.

40|$|As {{long as a}} wound is infected, {{the healing}} process cannot begin. The {{indication}} for wound antiseptic {{is dependent on the}} interaction between the wound, the causative micro-organisms, and the host immune system. An uncritical colonisation is a condition whereby micro-organisms on a wound will proliferate, yet the immune system will not react excessively. Wound antiseptic is most often not necessary unless for epidemiologic reasons like colonisation with multi-resistant organisms. In most instances of a microbial contamination of the wound and colonisation, thorough cleaning will be sufficient. Bacterial counts above 105 to 106 cfu per gram tissue (critical colonisation) might decrease wound healing due to release of toxins, particularly in chronic wounds. Traumatic and heavily contaminated wounds therefore will require anti-infective measures, in particular wound antiseptic. In such situations, even a single application of an antiseptic compound will significantly reduce the number of pathogens, and hence, the risk of infection. If a wound infection is clinically manifest, local antiseptics and systemic antibiotics are therapeutically indicated. The prophylactic and therapeutic techniques for treatment of acute and chronic wounds (chemical antiseptics using xenobiotics or antibiotics, biological antiseptic applying maggots, medical honey or chitosan, physical antiseptic using water-filtered infrared A, UV, or electric current) mostly have been empirically developed without establishing a fundamental working hypothesis for their effectiveness. The most important aspect in controlling a wound infection and achieving <b>healing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wound</b> is meticulous debridement of necrotic material. This is achieved by surgical, enzymatic or biological means e. g. using maggots. However, none of these methods (with some exception for maggots) is totally gentle to vital tissue and particularly chemical methods possess cytotoxicity effects. Derived from the general principles of antiseptic wound treatment, the following working hypothesis is postulated: the most ideal constellation for treatment of wounds is the superficial destruction of microbial layers without deep tissue alteration, like it is caused by antiseptics, in order not to endanger the regenerative granulation tissue. At the same time, it is desirable to support and increase cell proliferation and granulation capacities. These two aspects might be achieved by using low temperature plasma technology...|$|E

In patients with clinical signs or symptoms, NIVS provide crucial information on the presence, location, and severity of PAD, as well as <b>an</b> objective assessment <b>of</b> the potential for primary <b>healing</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> index <b>wound</b> or <b>a</b> surgical incision. Appropriately-selected NIVS are important in the decision-making process to determine whether and what type of intervention might be most appropriate, given the clinical circumstances. Hemodynamic monitoring is likewise very important following either an endovascular procedure or a surgical bypass. Surveillance studies, usually with <b>a</b> combination <b>of</b> physiologic testing and imaging with duplex ultrasound, accurately identify recurrent disease prior to the occurrence of thrombosis, allowing targeted reintervention. NIVS can be broadly grouped into three general categories: physiologic or hemodynamic measurements; anatomic imaging; and measurements of tissue perfusion. These types of tests and suggestions for their appropriate application in patients with diabetes are reviewed...|$|R

When the normal biological process fails for any reason, this healing process can stall resulting in chronic <b>wounds.</b> <b>Wounds</b> are <b>a</b> growing clinical burden on healthcare systems {{and with an}} aging population as well as increasing incidences of obesity and diabetes, this problem is set to increase. Cell therapies may be the solution. <b>A</b> range <b>of</b> cell based approaches have begun to cross the rift from bench to bedside and the supporting data suggests that the appropriate administration of stem cells can accelerate wound healing. This review examines the main cell types explored for cutaneous <b>wound</b> healing with <b>a</b> focus on clinical use. The literature overwhelmingly suggests that cell therapies can help to heal cutaneous wounds when used appropriately but we {{are at risk of}} clinical use outpacing the evidence. There is a need, now more than ever, for standardised methods of cell characterisation and delivery, as well as randomised clinical trials...|$|R
