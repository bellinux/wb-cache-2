40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The research work was concened with the design of tension compensators for spinning-winding machines {{for the purposes of}} reducing winding tension variation during high speed cone winding. Initially, the research was directed to investigating the 'winding error', i. e. the difference between yarn supply and demand, which was the main cause of winding tension variation. Mathematical models were established to analyse the winding velocity variation and yarn path length variation. Several methods have been investigated to reduce winding tension variation and to develop tension compensators. These include using a servo motor to keep constant winding velocity and using a curved <b>distribution</b> <b>bar</b> to keep constant path length. Two promising tension compensators were selected for detailed investigation. they were a mechanical compensator and a mechatronic compensator. Based on the analysis of 'winding error', A multiple bar mechanism was devised, analysed and optimised to provide tension compensation. Further consideration has been given to a microprocessor controlled mechanism, that works according to predetermined look-up tables and sensor signals to reduce winding tension variation. The computer simulation of yarn winding process, the software design for the optimisation of mechanical compensator and the control of mechatronic compensator, and the results of winding tension experimentation are also presented in the thesis...|$|E
40|$|Current {{views in}} the {{teaching}} and learning of data handling suggest that learners should create graphs of data they collect themselves and not just use textbook data. It is presumed real-world data creates an ideal environment for learners to tap from their pool of stored knowledge and demonstrate their meta-representational competences. Although prior knowledge is acknowledged as a critical resource out of which expertise is constructed, empirical evidence shows that new levels of mathematical thinking do not always build logically and consistently on previous experience. This suggests that researchers should analyse this resource in more detail in order to understand where prior knowledge could be supportive and where it could be problematic in the process of learning. This article analyses Grade 11 learners’meta-representational competences when constructing bar graphs. The basic premise was that by examining the process of graph construction and how learners respond to a variety of stages thereof, it was possible to create a description of a graphical frame or a knowledge representation structure that was stored in the learner’s memory. Errors could then be described and explained in terms of the inadequacies of the frame, that is: ‘Is the learner making good use of the stored prior knowledge?’ A total of 43 learners were observed over a week in a classroom environment whilst they attempted to draw graphs for data they had collected for a mathematics project. Four units of analysis are used to focus on how learners created a frequency table, axes, bars and the overall representativeness of the graph vis-à-vis the data. Results show that learners had an inadequate graphical frame as they drew a graph that had elements of a value bar graph, <b>distribution</b> <b>bar</b> graph and a histogram all representing the same data set. This inability to distinguish between these graphs and the types of data they represent implies that learners were likely to face difficulties with measures of centre and variability which are interpreted differently across these three graphs but are foundational in all statistical thinking...|$|E

40|$|The <b>distribution</b> of <b>bar</b> {{strengths}} in disk galaxies is {{a fundamental}} property of the galaxy population that has only begun to be explored. We have applied the bar/spiral separation method of Buta, Block, and Knapen to derive the distribution of maximum relative gravitational bar torques, Q_b, for 147 spiral galaxies in the statistically well-defined Ohio State University Bright Galaxy Survey (OSUBGS) sample. Our goal {{is to examine the}} properties of bars as independently as possible of their associated spirals. We find that the <b>distribution</b> of <b>bar</b> strength declines smoothly with increasing Q_b, with more than 40 % of the sample having Q_b <= 0. 1. In the context of recurrent bar formation, this suggests that strongly-barred states are relatively short-lived compared to weakly-barred or non-barred states. We do not find compelling evidence for a bimodal <b>distribution</b> of <b>bar</b> strengths. Instead, the distribution is fairly smooth in the range 0. 0 <= Q_b < 0. 8. Our analysis also provides a first look at spiral strengths Q_s in the OSU sample, based on the same torque indicator. We are able to verify a possible weak correlation between Q_s and Q_b, in the sense that galaxies with the strongest bars tend also to have strong spirals.

The research described was primarily concerned with working towards {{the solution of the}} problem of yarn tension control when building conical packages on an open-end spinning machine at yarn delivery speeds of 500 m 1 min"cause of the total lack of published work on the mathematical modelling of the parameters affecting tension variation, a considerable amount of effort was spent in the establishment of this basic understanding. This mathematical analysis appears, in the main, in the appendices to this thesis. In addition to the analysis of yarn tension variations depending on machine geometry parameters, mathematical models have also been produced which predict the effect on tension of fitting curved <b>distribution</b> <b>bars</b> of various shapes. The work includes the development of concept ideas which appeared capable of providing routes for solution of the tension control problem. These ideas were evaluated and compared against a design specification which was also developed as part of this research. Two promising concepts were selected for detailed investigation. These were: a pneumatic passive compensator and, a positive mechanical compensator. The pneumatic compensator was a novel idea which was conceived by the author, and which eventually provided a solution which met the design specification in every way. The mechanical compensator was shown to be a far less attractive concept with several serious problems which have been explored but not eliminated.

The structural properties of the galaxies have been studied in detail in Gadotti (2009 b) and the sample contains 251 bulges in galaxies with bars. Using the whole sample, where galaxy stellar mass <b>distributions</b> for <b>barred</b> and unbarred galaxies are similar, we find that bulges in barred and unbarred galaxies occupy similar loci in the age vs. metallicity plane. However, the distribution of bulge ages in barred galaxies shows an excess of populations younger than ~ 4 Gyr, when compared to bulges in unbarred galaxies. Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics confirm that the age distributions are different with a significance of 99. 94 %. If we select sub-samples for which the bulge stellar mass distributions are similar for barred and unbarred galaxies, this excess vanishes for galaxies with bulge mass log M < 10. 1 M_Sun while for more massive galaxies we find a bimodal bulge age <b>distribution</b> for <b>barred</b> galaxies only, corresponding to two normal distributions with mean ages of 10. 4 and 4. 7 Gyr.
