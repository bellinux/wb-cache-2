5|$|Croatia and Slovenia started {{negotiations}} to define maritime borders in the Gulf of Piran in 1992 {{but failed to}} agree, resulting in a dispute. Both countries also declared their economic zones, which partially overlap. Croatia's application to become an <b>EU</b> <b>member</b> <b>state</b> was initially suspended pending resolution of its border disputes with Slovenia. These were eventually settled with an agreement to accept the decision of an international arbitration commission set up via the UN, enabling Croatia to progress towards EU membership. The dispute has caused no major practical problems in areas other than the EU membership negotiations progress, even before the arbitration agreement.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{signature}} of its Stabilisation and Association Agreement in 2001, Croatia applied for European Union (EU) membership in 2003, the European Commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004, and the European Council granted candidate country status to Croatia in mid-2004. Accession negotiations, while originally set for March 2005, began in October of that year. Croatia completed the accession negotiations on 30 June 2011; on 9 December 2011 it signed the Treaty of Accession, changing its status from a candidate to an acceding country as it prepared to become the 28th <b>EU</b> <b>member</b> <b>state.</b> The ratification process by the Parliaments of all 27 current EU member states {{was expected to be}} concluded by the end of June 2013, and Croatia's accession to the EU was expected to take place on 1 July 2013. In addition to ratification by the current EU member states, Article 142 of the Constitution of Croatia requires that a binding referendum be held on sovereignty issues such as Croatian EU membership.|$|E
5|$|The EU's {{institutional}} set up is also {{somewhat similar}} {{to the government of}} Switzerland (which, although in Europe, is not an <b>EU</b> <b>member</b> <b>state).</b> The Swiss consensus-driven system is seen as successfully uniting a state divided by language and religion, although the EU was not directly modelled on the Swiss system despite bearing a number of similarities. The European Commission has similarities to the Swiss Federal Council in that both have all-party representation and are appointed on the basis of nationality rather than popularity. The President of the Federal Council rotates between its members each year, in a fashion {{similar to that of the}} EU's Council Presidency. Due to this system of presidency Swiss leaders, like those of the EU, are relatively unknown with national politics viewed as somewhat technocratic resulting in low voter turnout, in a similar fashion to that of the European Parliament. Other parallels include the jealously guarded powers of states, the considerable level of translation and the choice of a lesser city as the capital.|$|E

The results indicate a high level of participation of <b>EU</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> in GVCs with a predominance of backward linkages. Luxembourg, Slovakia and Hungary have the highest levels of participation while Croatia has the lowest participation. <b>EU</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> are very integrated and intra-regional, so about 80 % of value added in their gross export or final demand originates from the EU (domestic value added or value added from other <b>member</b> <b>states)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the monetary benefits available in the context of long-term care provided by family or other informal carers in 11 old and 10 new <b>EU</b> <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> All but one country in our sample offer at least some monetary benefits {{that can be used to}} help finance informal care. Old <b>EU</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> tend to direct benefits to individuals in need of care, whereas new <b>EU</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> place more emphasis on benefits for carers. Among new <b>EU</b> <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> monetary benefits are less often means-tested and tend to be lower compared with benefits in old <b>EU</b> <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> Because social policies in many countries increasingly rely on monetary benefits rather than on benefits in kind and because the share of informal care in the overall provision of elderly care will scarcely decline, monetary benefit incentives for labour market participation need to be carefully monitored.

40|$|The 27 European Union (<b>EU)</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> {{increased}} their total agri-food exports {{during the period}} 2000 - 2011. However, despite agri-food exports having grown, the shares of the world agri-food markets of 13 <b>EU</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> and the EU- 27 as a whole have declined. Those with increasing market share are mainly among the Eastern <b>EU</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> Constant market share analysis by 27 <b>EU</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> suggests that the structural effects in agri-food and dairy exports {{are more important than}} the residual and second order effects. The declining market share is largely associated with negative residual and second order effects.

40|$|The paperʼs main {{objective}} is to investigate the empirical link between the fiscal balance and the current account. The paper focuses on the <b>EU</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> and candidate countries which are according to their different (historical, political, economical and geographical) characteristics divided into two major groups, i. e. old <b>EU</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> (EU- 15) and new <b>EU</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> and candidate countries (EU 12 + 3) in the 1995 - 2008 period. The empirical results suggest that budget deficits in the <b>EU</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> and candidate countries have generally signaled relatively high level of substitutability between private and public savings, implying a relatively low correlation between fiscal and external imbalances. Finally, the paper provides evidence of a relatively higher level of capital mobility in the EU 12 + 3 region, particularly in the second sub-period (2004 - 2008) ...|$|R
