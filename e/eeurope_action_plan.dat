Eventually in 2002 the eGovernment Strategy was adopted updating thus the ISS. Since January 2006 all government ministries, departments, and services have their own website. At the same year the first government web portal, was launched making accessible several governmental and non-governmental websites and many informative and interactive services.

40|$|The {{manner in}} which public {{administration}} is performed and the services it provides for citizens and the business sector are undergoing significant changes in Europe {{as well as in}} other developed countries around the world. Information and communication technologies (ICT) are contributing substantially to this. Evidence of how important the digitisation of public administration is viewed by EU Member State governments and the European Commission is the fact that e-government has been made one of the priorities of the <b>eEurope</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> 2005 1. This action plan links to the new common political framework for a knowledge economy, agreed at the European Council’s Lisbon Summit in March 2000, which is aimed at increasing competitiveness, ensuring permanently sustainable economic growth, increasing employment and the social cohesion of EU Member States. The acceding countries, including the Slovak Republic, have adopted the <b>eEurope</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> 2, which is expanded by the construction of the basic building blocks of an information society.

40|$|The {{broadband}} ‘revolution’ At {{the time}} of writing there is an almost ceaseless stream of news flashes and marketing messages trumpeting the future social and economic (not to ignore profitable) opportunities of broadband Internet access in the home. This has not gone unnoticed in policy circles since the early 1990 s (Bange-mann, 1994; DTI, 1994). More recently, and as a natural progression from the Bangemann report, the <b>eEurope</b> 2005 <b>Action</b> <b>plan</b> 1 states: broadband enabled communication, in combination with convergence, will bring social {{as well as economic}} benefits. It will contribute to e-inclusion, cohesion and cultural diversity. It offers the potential to improve and simplify the life of all Europeans and to change the way people interact, not just at work, but also with friends, family, community, and institutions. (CEC, 2002 : 8) But is this happening, and what evidence do we have of the difference that broadband makes to the domestic user? This chapter uses data from the e-Living survey to assess at least some of these issues empirically. The processes of choosing a broadband connection, the characteristics of those who do so and the possible effects this has have all been the focus of a number of academic studies, as well as many private and public market research surveys such as the Flash Eurobarometers funded by the European Commission (Gallup Europe, 2002). Many of these studies concentrate on modelling and forecasting demand based on hypothetical price and charging schemes or potential applications and are of less interest here (see, for example, Madden and Simpson, 1997; Ida and Kuroda, 2004; Savage and Waldman, 2005). Others have used survey data to study the characteristics of early adopters of broadband. For the USA in 2000, Kridel and colleagues (2002) found that broadband adopters tended to be younger and have higher income and education levels. For Korea, Lee et al.

40|$|Preservation of {{national}} cultural heritage has been {{during the last}} years actively discussed both on institutional and state levels. In October 2003 the working group on digital preservation by theMinistry of Culture elaborated preservation guidelines Strategy of digital preservation of Estonian cultural heritage for years 2004 – 2007. The strategy {{is based on the}} principles of <b>eEurope</b> 2002 <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> (2000) and Lund Principles (2001). The state strategy is aimed to achieve collaboration of different memory institutions in order to elaborate an unified view on cultural heritage and its digitisation as well as to preservation of digitally created cultural heritage. It is also important to guarantee preservation of cultural heritage and to make it accessible to the public use through the contemporary possibilities of informationand communication technologies. Digitisation and preservation of digitized heritage will be coordinated by the state. The main coordinators are the Ministry of Culture, The Ministry of Educationand Science, the State Chancellery and the National Archive. The methodology of decision making for digital preservation is based on the principles of the UNESCO programme Memory of the World. The choice of objects for digitisation is based on need and expediency that can be evaluated on the ground of acultural value of an object, conservation risks, physical condition of an object and necessity of use. In 2004 – 2005 metadata requirements for digital preservation were elaborated. The guidelines foresee that digitized objects will be described by four categories of metadata: administrative andtechnical metadata, metadata on access inhibitors and restrictions of use and descriptive metadata. Estonian documentary heritage is located today in different memory institutions: in state or public institutions like archives, libraries and museums, in private possession, in religious and scientific institutions and in possession of the third sector (different organisations). For reasons of the historical development considerable part of documentary heritage is also located outside Estonia (Sweden, USA, Canada, Australia, Russia etc). The projects of red books as well as different digitisation projects have been in practice for some years in all Estonian memory institutions. Libraries are pioneers in initiating collaborationprojects in digitisation. Due to the joint efforts of the National Library, the Archive Library of the Estonian Literature Museum and the Tallinn University Academic Library a big collection of old Estonian newspapers is available by internet. The project is titled DEA (Digitized Estonian Newspapers). The aim of the project Red Book of Estonian publications, 1535 – 1850 was to create a theoretical basis for elaborating criteria that would enable decision making and determination preservation priorities of the Estonian book heritage. At the moment there is not much collaboration between different types of memory institutions.

The quality of <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> in terms of instrumentality and specificity is important in terms of supporting a successful change in health behaviour. Until now, little has been known about the predictors of <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> generation and the predictors of high quality <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> and, therefore, the current study investigates these predictors. Method A randomised controlled trial was conducted to improve physical activity (PA) and fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption using a web-based computer tailored intervention. During the 8 -week intervention period, participants in the intervention arm (n[*]=[*] 346) were guided (step-by-step) to generate their own <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> to improve their health behaviours. Demographic characteristics, social cognitions, and health behaviour were assessed at baseline by means of self-reporting. Whether participants generated <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> was tracked by means of server registrations within two modules of the intervention. Results The <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> component of the intervention regarding physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption was used by 40. 9 and 20. 7  % of the participants, respectively. We found that participants who were physically active at baseline were less likely to generate <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> concerning physical activity. With regards to generating fruit and vegetable <b>action</b> <b>plans,</b> participants with a high risk perception and a strong intention to eat fruit and vegetables on a daily basis made more use of the <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> component for this behaviour. Finally, the large majority of the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> for physical activity (96. 6  %) and fruit and vegetable consumption (100  %) were instrumental and about half of the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> were found to be highly specific (PA[*]=[*] 69. 6  %/FV[*]=[*] 59. 7  %). The specificity of the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> is associated with having a relationship and low levels of negative outcome expectancies. Conclusion Risk perception and intention are predictors of using the application of <b>action</b> <b>planning.</b> Increasing the motivation to change behaviour should be prioritised in interventions concerning changes in health behaviour before participants are asked to generate <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> This would also make the intervention suitable for unmotivated people. For those participants who already perform the desired health behaviour prior to the intervention, <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> might be less relevant. Nevertheless, using a guided step-by-step approach to generate <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> resulted in highly instrumental and specific <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> and might be integrated into other interventions concerning changes in health behaviour.

40|$|<b>Action</b> <b>planning</b> {{is both a}} new and an old concept. Goal setting {{became an}} {{important}} part of mental health interventions as early as the 1960 s. For many years, the terms goal setting, contracting, and self-regulation were used more or less interchangeably. More recently, the concept has been termed <b>action</b> <b>planning.</b> 1 Handley et al offer the definition of an <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> “the agreement between clinician and patient that the patient will make a specific behavior change. ” 2 Whereas this is an excellent definition for the use of <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> in a clinical context, {{it should be noted that}} patients, once they have the skill, can make <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> on their own.

To scalably provide personalized <b>action</b> <b>plans,</b> this paper introduces and evaluates crowdsourcing and peer approaches for creating plans, and NLP techniques for reus-ing them.
