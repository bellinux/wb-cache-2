For this purpose, wastewater-based epidemiology has been applied as a complementary method to estimate the overall alcohol and tobacco consumption in different communities.

40|$|Measurements of organosulfates {{in ambient}} {{aerosols}} provide insight {{to the extent}} of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from mixtures of biogenic gases and anthropogenic pollutants. Organosulfates have, however, proved analytically challenging to quantify, due to lack of authentic standards and the complex sample matrix in which organosulfates are observed. This study presents a sensitive and accurate new analytical method for the quantification of organosulfates based upon ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with negative electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS) with the aid of synthesized organosulfate standards. The separation is based upon hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) with an amide stationary phase that provides excellent retention of carboxy-organosulfates and isoprene-derived organosulfates. The method is validated using six model compounds: methyl <b>sulfate,</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>sulfate,</b> benzyl sulfate, hydroxyacetone sulfate, lactic acid sulfate and glycolic acid sulfate. A straightforward protocol for synthesis of highly pure organosulfate potassium salts for use as quantification standards is presented. This method is used to evaluate the efficiency and precision of two methods of ambient PM 2. 5 sample extraction. Spike recoveries averaged 98 ± 8 % for extraction by ultra-sonication and 98 ± 10 % for extraction by rotary shaking. Ultra-sonication was determined to be a better method due to its higher precision compared to rotary shaking. Analysis of ambient PM 2. 5 samples collected on 10 – 11 July 2013 in Centreville, AL, USA during the Southeast Atmosphere Study (SAS) confirms the presence of hydroxyacetone sulfate in ambient aerosol for the first time.

Results: The main pathway of metabolism is catalyzed by cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase, which exhibits multiple isoenzymes and genetic polymorphisms with clinical and forensic implications.
