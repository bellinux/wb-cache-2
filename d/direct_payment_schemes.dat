40|$|The basic {{principle}} of PES {{is to pay}} individuals or groups to protect or enhance natural resources in exchange for financial or in-kind compensation. One striking feature of the PES concept is the diversity of “PES-like” schemes in the real world, which differ greatly from the theoretical conceptualization of PES. We assume that {{the wide range of}} designs and outcomes is due to the use of PES tools in particular environmental, political, and economic contexts. More precisely, existing conservation strategies is a determining factor in shaping the PSE-inspired interventions. Here, we analyze the implementation of an internationally-designed <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> program in Madagascar. We show that the predominance of a coercive logic in the Malagasy conservation strategy determines the conditions under which the <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> <b>scheme</b> is implemented.

40|$|On the {{background}} of extensive government interventions in grain markets and the <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> of subsidy policies, the subsidy policies may hardly show negative impacts on grain prices through increasing grain supply.

The estimated {{results indicate that the}} subsidy variable is highly significant in the grain price model for each grain type, while the general impacts of subsidies are positive. This suggests that agricultural subsidy policies contribute to increases in market prices for grain. Statistically, the overall elasticities of subsidies to the prices of rice, wheat, and corn are 0. 077, 0. 094, and 0. 180, respectively.

40|$|For {{a decade}} or more, Americans {{have been exposed to}} an {{argument}} about educational change and improvement that has as its core concept the deregulation of public education.

40|$|The {{origins of}} the <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> <b>scheme</b> lie with the Disabled People’s {{movement}} and the revolutionary idea of providing disabled people with cash to pay directly for their assessed care and support needs. Authorisation was given in 1997 to local authorities in England to offer cash payments to purchase care and support services through the implementation of The Community Care 1996 (<b>Direct</b> <b>Payments)</b> Act. This <b>scheme</b> was initially restricted to those aged {{between the ages of}} 18 - 65 years. However since February 2000 (July 2000 in Scotland) this has been extended to include disabled people aged 65 and over, and further expanded in 2001 to include young disabled people between the ages of 16 and 18 years. Prior to the implementation of the Community Care Act, procedures following a community care assessment placed the local authority in complete control regarding arranging and coordinating an individual’s care package. The local authority arranged when and where services were provided, and who would provide them. The <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> <b>scheme</b> could offer an alternative, more flexible approach, with the potential to empower individuals choosing to opt into this scheme. Individuals in receipt of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> have control in making arrangements for the provision of services that work with their lifestyle as opposed to their lifestyle ‘fitting around’ local authority organised care and support services. <b>Direct</b> <b>payments</b> position the individual at the centre of control for their own service provision. Initially, <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> as a <b>scheme</b> was relaxed and local authorities were not obliged to offer <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> as an alternative to everyone. However, since April 2003 (June 2003 in Scotland), local authorities are now obliged to offer <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> to all those eligible.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{goes beyond}} {{orthodox}} considerations of direct payment e®ects on agri-cultural output, by highlighting {{the role of}} subsidies in a®ecting individual producers ' ability to cover ¯xed costs, and in distorting the volume of aggregate production and net trade by implic-itly discouraging exits. The theoretical model considers both taxpayer and consumer ¯nanced decoupled <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> and compares them to a coupled production subsidy. In terms of possible producer responses to direct payments, we propose an analytical framework of production decision-making {{in the presence of}} a stochastic distribution of ¯xed costs across representative farms. We show that decoupled payments in theory can have a larger e®ect on output than coupled payments. The model explicitly recognizes three consequences of domes-tic support: (a) induce exit or entry; (b) bias production incentives to domestic markets; and (c) cross-subsidize export in global markets. An empirical model of the U. S. wheat sector is developed to illustrate the relative potential impacts of coupled versus decoupled payments on output through the e®ects on a farmer's ability to cover ¯xed costs and hence exit decisions...|$|E
40|$|The {{progressive}} attempt {{and implementation}} of direct payment limitations since the 1992 CAP reform has developed a “modulation mechanism” aiming to transfer funds from market support and <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> (CAP first pillar) towards rural development measures (CAP second pillar). Under the 2007 - 2013 European financial perspectives, the annual 5 % rate of modulation is expected to increase. The paper focuses on the financial impacts of four scenarios together with corresponding political and institutional feasibilities. The paper imposes on itself three sound constraints: (i) expanding modulation should not jeopardise the future in-depth reform of the direct payment regime, (ii) modulation should be compulsory and consistent with rural development financial needs, and (iii) present direct payment per farm should not be capped or subject to complex and differentiated reduction rates. Then, the paper suggests adopting a dynamic and uniform modulation rate to be increased by 1 percent per year from 2009 and then by 2 percent during the final step reaching 10 percent in 2012 (2013 financial year). It would deliver certainty to farmers and contribute to an efficient use in European spending, with {{no need for a}} controversial equity instrument. Direct payment reductions raise subsidiarity and budgetary issues which should be discussed within the European budget review. Considering the modulation mechanism as a related past-policy tool, renewed European decision making process and actors should outline from 2009 a new paradigm in direct payment regime. Since farmers are increasingly becoming entrepreneurs, the sooner an agreement on the CAP beyond 2013 is reached, the better. direct payments, rural development, European budget, Agricultural Finance,...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two studies on the dairy sector in Kosovo. The first study evaluates {{the effect of the}} Subsidy per Head Scheme (SPHS) on increasing production, land use, gross income and number of dairy cows on dairy farms in Kosovo. Results from the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) approach using four alternative matching algorithms revealed that SPHS has not had any impact on increasing land use, gross income or the number of dairy cows per farm. Furthermore, SPHS had a negative impact on decreasing land use and number of cows for the participating dairy farmers in the program. In terms of milk production, SPHS has not had any meaningful effect on increasing milk productivity when compared to farms that did not participate in the program. Improvement in milk production per cow was found to be a statistically significant effect for two matching algorithms. However, two other algorithms revealed insignificant effect of SPHS on improving milk productivity. The second study provides estimates of the technical efficiency level for a random sample of 243 dairy farms in Kosovo over the 2014 farming season. Statistically significant determinants of technical efficiency are identified. A stochastic frontier production function was estimated using a two stage procedure. Results revealed that feeding rates (specifically of concentrates and silage), land use per cow, and the number of days that cows had been kept on pastures have statistically significant impacts on milk productivity per cow. The mean technical efficiency of dairy farms was estimated at 0. 72. The major determinants that help to improve the efficiency are breed improvement, intensification of corn production on the farm, improving feeding rates, and using free range production systems. Given the results from the SPHS impact assessment and technical efficiency analysis, it is crucial for the Government of Kosovo to redesign their dairy policy, specifically their <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> and target technical assistance and investment support based on regional potentials...|$|E

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in the potential of payments for ecosystem services (PES) to encourage land managers to protect and enhance the environment. However, questions remain about how PES agreements should be designed. There is a division between schemes that structure payments by action or by results, with most biodiversity PES schemes, including European agri-environment schemes, paying by action; for example incentivising land managers to carry out actions believed to increase biodiversity. Payment by results is a common incentive structure {{in the private sector}} (e. g. labourers doing piece work or no-win no-fee lawyers) but rarer in PES. Using a theoretical modelling approach, we investigate the conditions under which each way of structuring payments may be more cost-effective in a biodiversity PES. Payment by action is favoured where there is a clear action that can be specified at an appropriate level and to which biodiversity is sensitive. We found that payment by results is favoured in degraded landscapes as incentives are created for managers to use their private knowledge and join the scheme only if they can produce the biodiversity services targeted by the scheme. Payment by results is also favoured where biodiversity is less sensitive to conservation action and when it is difficult for a central agency to determine an appropriate level of conservation action. This is because payment by results allows individual managers to optimise their level of action. The relative cost of monitoring action (compliance with an agreement to manage in a certain way) versus results (the presence of biodiversity) has a substantial effect on which payment structure is more efficient only when the central agency can accurately set an appropriate level of action. We illustrate these principles with examples based on agri-environment schemes. Synthesis and applications. Payment by results deserves more attention from those designing biodiversity PES (be they agri-environment schemes in agricultural landscapes or <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> in more intact ecosystems).

40|$|Since 1993, the Swiss federal {{agricultural}} {{policy has been}} providing financial support for organic farming via area payments. Like other voluntary agri-environmental measures (AEM), these payments are intended as incentives for farmers to comply with defined production standards. Such payments lead to better environmental performance, as compliance with organic production standards averts negative and provides positive external effects compared to conventional or integrated farming (CRER, 2002). For instance, organic farming is largely not dependent on external inputs. This minimises the resource use of the farming system and limits the nutrient loads in the system, which in turn leads to less overfertilisation and reduced eutrophication risks involving nitrogen and phosphorus (Haas et al., 2001). Besides effectiveness, {{against the background of}} limited public budgets, efficiency in delivering environmental impacts plays a fundamental role in the further development of <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> (Swiss Federal Council, 2009). The targeting and tailoring of policies to achieve maximum effectiveness with a given budget is essential (OECD, 2007). It is therefore necessary to compare both environmental effects and the societal costs of AEM with each other in order to provide a basis for economically sound policy design (Pearce, 2005). Agricultural economists hold differing views on the cost-effectiveness of organic farming support payments. Von Alvensleben (1998) argues that the organic farming area support payments are not economically sound, as the policy goals could be achieved more efficiently using more flexible and targeted combinations of various AEM. The economic rationale behind this argument was introduced by Tinbergen (1956), who theorised that an efficient policy requires at least as many specific instruments as there are specific goals. However, the Tinbergen Rule may not apply fully in this case due to interactions between policies, conflicting goals and the limited determinability of different aspects of environmental performance. Furthermore, the multi-purpose character of organic agriculture could increase its cost-effectiveness due to its potentially lower transaction costs compared to targeted AEM (Dabbert et al., 2004). Empirical papers on this question lack. Thus, this paper aims to compare the cost-effectiveness of a) direct payments to organic farms and b) AEM, in providing environmental services. This is done, using the current Swiss {{agricultural policy}} scheme as a case study...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{literature review}} was undertaken {{in order to}} define and assess the sustainability and resiliency characteristics associated with grass-based and confinement dairy farming. Primarily {{as a result of}} reduced input costs, grass-based dairy farming often enhances profitability over confinement systems, especially on small farms. Further, conversion of tilled soil to permanent pasture has been shown to significantly reduce harmful sediment and nutrient transport into waterways. Perennial forage also acts as a carbon sink, curtailing or even negating a grass-based farm 2 ̆ 7 s carbon footprint. Finally, social benefits derived from enhanced nutrition and higher quality of life are also associated with grass-based dairy farming. Given that policy goals of the State of Vermont include both bolstering farm viability and reducing farm-related runoff, two questions are then raised. What is {{the most effective way to}} incentivize the adoption of rotational grazing in Vermont? And what types of farms are best suited to its use? A series of interviews with dairy experts and farmers was conducted as a preliminary investigation into these questions. This qualitative evidence suggested that farmers generally adopted grass-based dairying after observing a peer 2 ̆ 7 s success with the method, suggesting that a key leverage point may be peer-based learning. A behavioral economics game was developed to evaluate the role of peer networks in facilitating decision-making under conditions of uncertainty. A computerized game platform simulated networks of small dairy farm enterprises, with participants acting as farm managers. Treatments varied the size of peer networks, as well as the inclusion of a perfectly-performing automated 2 ̆ 7 seed player. 2 ̆ 7 Participants could base their decisions upon the successes of their peers. They received a cash incentive based on their farms 2 ̆ 7 performance. Results indicated that players with higher numbers of peers made better economic decisions on average. The inclusion of a 2 ̆ 7 seed player 2 ̆ 7 within a network, which modeled the ideal behavior, also facilitated better decision-making. Both of these correlations were statistically significant. Furthermore, the shape of the 2 ̆ 7 diffusion curve 2 ̆ 7 of new adoptees confirmed literature on the dynamics of innovation diffusion. Public policy implications from this work include an increased focus on facilitating peer-to-peer learning among farmers where Best Management Practice adoption is a policy goal. To further evaluate the potential for peer learning to facilitate positive change, the Dairy Farm Transitions Agent Based Model (DFTABM) was developed. The model was calibrated using existing datasets along with the qualitative and quantitative results described above. It forecasts effects on farm profitability, attrition, and soil loss arising from varying assumptions about peer network connectivity, peer emulation, macroeconomic trends, and agri-environmental policy. Nine experimental treatments were assessed. Overall, it was found that high rates of emulation coupled with high rates of connectivity 2 ̆ 7 especially targeted connectivity among smaller farms 2 ̆ 7 yielded the best balance of farm viability and reduction in soil loss. The establishment of a performance-based tax credit had no clear correlation with the resulting soil loss figures predicted by the model. Policy implications from this study include the finding that <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> for reduction in environmental harm may not always have their intended effects, whereas policies that enhance peer-to-peer learning opportunities, especially among the proprietors of smaller farms, may present an effective and relatively affordable means by which to bolster farm profitability while also reducing environmental degradation...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate decision making impacts of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> <b>scheme</b> implemented with the reform: regional or more likely hybrid scheme. The change in farm production structure was simulated with model, applying gross margin maximisation, based on static linear programming approach. The model has been developed in a spreadsheet framework in MS Excel platform. A hypothetical farm has been chosen to analyse different scenarios and specializations. Focus of the analysis was on cattle sector, since it is expected that decoupling is going to have significant influence on its optimal production structure. The reason is high level of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> that could in pre-reform scheme rise up to 70 % of total gross margin. Model results confirm that the reform should have unfavourable impacts on cattle farms with intensive production practice. The results show that hybrid scheme has minor negative impacts in all cattle specializations, while regional scheme would be better option for sheep specialized farm. Analysis has also shown growing importance of CAP pillar II payments, among them particularly agri-environmental measures. In all three <b>schemes</b> budgetary <b>payments</b> enable farmers to improve financial results and in both reform schemes they alleviate economic impacts of the CAP reform...|$|R
30|$|However, {{the main}} focus of this paper was the redistributive effect of the new <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> <b>scheme</b> {{introduced}} by the CAP 2013 reform that replaced the former SPS in Italy, where approximately 90 % of the national ceiling was devoted to the BPS and the GR. Both static and dynamic analyses highlighted an expected decrease in the concentration of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> by 2019 because Italy will progressively shift from the “historical” regional model to a tunnel model for internal convergence during the transitional 2015 – 2020 period. Conversely, the decrease in the DP/FI ratio between 2014 and 2019 due to both policy changes and exogenous factors is expected to negatively affect the ability of these payments to oppose the regressive effect of MIs, particularly for regions and sectors that mainly benefitted from the SPS introduced by CAP 2003 reform. In more detail, the results indirectly highlight that the more farm income is affected by changing market conditions (increasingly influenced by price volatility) related to output composition (consumption, investment, government expenditure, and gross exports and imports), the more unequally it is distributed. This phenomenon is affected by any increase (decrease) in the budget for DPs, which could improve (worsen) the stabilization and redistribution of farm income and reduce (increase) its concentration since such aid tends to equalize farm income.|$|R

The project has also developed a comprehensive set of 'products' to enable managers across the sector to implement the recommendations. These products are commended to all managers and leaders in social care - both adults' and children's services - including service users who are employers under <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> <b>schemes.</b> Together the products make for a very thorough piece of work that will reward well time spent working through them and applying them to particular settings.

40|$|A crucial {{element of}} the post- 2013 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform is the ‘greening’ payment. ‘Greening’ is a {{compulsory}} {{part of the new}} <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> <b>scheme,</b> accounting for 30 per cent of national ceilings. To qualify, farmers must undertake compulsory agricultural practices that are ‘beneficial for the climate and the environment’, comprising crop diversification, maintenance of existing permanent grassland and establishing an ecological focus area or putting in place ‘equivalent measures’. The payment had a controversial legislative passage, with several environmental groups questioning its pro-environmental effects and alleging that it was merely a clever way of disguising product support to European Union (EU) farmers, even before several of the provisions were watered down by the European Parliament. Despite these difficulties, throughout the process all parties assumed the ‘greening’ payment was compatible with the Green Box exemption in the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), so that it would be exempt from the EU’s domestic support reduction commitments in that Agreement. Specifically, it was understood that the payment would be decoupled income support under paragraph 6 of Annex 2 to the AoA and as such the payment had ‘no, or at most minimal trade-distorting effects or effects on production’ under paragraph 1 of the same Annex (the so-called ‘fundamental requirement’) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{communication}} containing {{proposals for}} {{reform of the}} EU olive-oil regime was forwarded by the European Commission to the EU Council and European Parliament on September 23 rd 2003. There are concerns that a complete conversion into a single decoupled <b>payment</b> <b>scheme</b> could lead to land abandonment in traditional olive-growing areas, so partial decoupling, with 60 % of payments to be decoupled and incorporated into the single farm <b>payment</b> <b>scheme</b> is proposed. 40 % of payments are to remain within national envelopes, nominally not linked to production but linked {{to the maintenance of}} olive groves, the soil and the environment. Full details of the reform proposals and their likely impact {{can be found in the}} Commission communication to the Council and European Parliament (COM (2003) 544 final). It is anticipated that adhesion to the single farm <b>payment</b> <b>scheme</b> will result in more stable incomes for olive-oil producers, due to the greater efficiency of <b>direct</b> aid <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> in getting money into farmers pockets.
