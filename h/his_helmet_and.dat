25|$|During his trial, Vanunu {{was brought}} to court wearing a {{motorcycle}} helmet to conceal his face. On September 1, 1987, while being brought into court, Vanunu tried to take off <b>his</b> <b>helmet</b> <b>and</b> started shouting in an apparent attempt {{to talk to the}} reporters nearby. His guards stopped him using physical force, and police sirens were turned on to drown out his voice.|$|E

25|$|In 848 Angoulême {{was sacked}} by the Viking chief Hastein. In 896 or 930 the city {{suffered}} another attack from invading Vikings {{but this time}} the Vikings faced an effective resistance.

25|$|Led {{from the}} front by Steve Waugh, Australia began the day at a {{precarious}} 291/8 but that {{would prove to be}} the high of the day for India. The 35 yr old Waugh batted well with Gillespie and then Glenn McGrath – and crossed numerous landmarks on the way – as he took Australia to a total of 445. In the process the Australian captain notched up his 25th Test century, crossing Sachin Tendulkar's tally of 24 hundreds at the time. Having never made a Test hundred in India, Waugh was more emotional than normal as he tugged at the red handkerchief in his pocket, took off <b>his</b> <b>helmet</b> <b>and</b> raised his bat to a full house Eden crowd. He also passed Javed Miandad to become the (then) 4th highest run getter in test cricket.|$|E
25|$|Sir Launfal {{returns to}} Caerleon. Soon a train of packhorses arrives, bearing {{all kinds of}} {{valuables}} for him. He uses this new wealth to perform many acts of charity. He also wins in a local tournament, thanks to the horse and banner given him by the lady. A knight of Lombardy, Sir Valentyne, challenges him (on the honour of his beloved lady) to come to Lombardy to fight with him. This section of Thomas Chestre's tale does not derive from Marie de France's Lanval or from the English Sir Landevale, but perhaps from another romance that is now lost. Launfal makes the voyage, and defeats Valentyne, thanks to his invisible servant Gyfre, who picks up <b>his</b> <b>helmet</b> <b>and</b> shield when Valentyne knocks them down. Launfal kills Valentyne and then has to kill many more of the Lombard knights {{in order to get}} away.|$|E

25|$|Lutyens was {{a friend}} of the Horner family, having {{designed}} multiple buildings and structures for them {{since the beginning of the}} 20th century. As well as Horner's memorial, he designed a memorial to Raymond Asquith (also in St Andrew's Church), and Mells War Memorial in the centre of the village. For Horner's, Lutyens designed the plinth himself, and engaged the renowned equestrian painter and war artist Alfred Munnings for the latter's first public work of sculpture. The plinth is in Portland stone and set into it is Horner's original grave marker; the family's coat of arms is carved into the front, while the sides bear various dedicatory inscriptions. The statue is a bronze of a cavalry officer on horseback, bare-headed, with <b>his</b> <b>helmet</b> <b>and</b> sword on the horse's saddle. Lutyens was known for abstract and ecumenical themes in his war memorial designs, but the statue of Horner is an example of his use of more conventional imagery when it came to commemorating an individual. It was installed in the Horner family chapel in St Andrew's Church in 1920 at a cost of £1,000 and moved elsewhere in the church in 2007 to create space.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as Rifle Squad Leader, 4th Platoon, Company K, Third Battalion, Seventh Marines (Reinforced), Regimental Combat Team 7, First Marine Division (Reinforced), on 14 April 2004. Corporal Dunham's squad was conducting a reconnaissance mission in the town of Karabilah, Iraq, when they heard rocket-propelled grenade and small arms fire erupt approximately two kilometers to the west. Corporal Dunham led his Combined Anti-Armor Team towards the engagement to provide fire support to their Battalion Commander's convoy, which had been ambushed as it was traveling to Camp Husaybah. As Corporal Dunham and his Marines advanced, they quickly began to receive enemy fire. Corporal Dunham ordered his squad to dismount their vehicles and led one of his fire teams on foot several blocks south of the ambushed convoy. Discovering seven Iraqi vehicles in a column attempting to depart, Corporal Dunham and his team stopped the vehicles to search them for weapons. As they approached the vehicles, an insurgent leaped out and attacked Corporal Dunham. Corporal Dunham wrestled the insurgent to the ground and in the ensuing struggle saw the insurgent release a grenade. Corporal Dunham immediately alerted his fellow Marines to the threat. Aware of the imminent danger and without hesitation, Corporal Dunham covered the grenade with <b>his</b> <b>helmet</b> <b>and</b> body, bearing the brunt of the explosion and shielding his Marines from the blast. In an ultimate and selfless act of bravery in which he was mortally wounded, he saved the lives of at least two fellow Marines. By his undaunted courage, intrepid fighting spirit, and unwavering devotion to duty, Corporal Dunham gallantly gave his life for his country, thereby reflecting great credit upon himself and upholding the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service".|$|E
25|$|Three Israeli commandos were {{captured}}. The first captured soldier, {{the commanding}} officer of the assault team, was abseiling from the helicopter when he was attacked by ten men before his feet hit the deck. He was beaten across his body and head, then picked up and thrown to the lower deck, where he was attacked by a dozen activists. They beat and choked him, removed his bulletproof vest and sidearm and smashed <b>his</b> <b>helmet,</b> <b>and</b> shoved him into a passenger hall below deck. The second soldier {{was surrounded by a}} team of fifteen to twenty activists in two groups. One group attacked him when he landed on the ship's roof. He fired one shot at an activist holding a knife before being subdued. The activists seized his gun and beat him as he attempted to fight them off {{with his back to the}} hull. He was picked up by his arms and legs, and thrown over the hull. He attempted to hang onto the hull with both hands, but was forced to let go when activists beat his hands and pulled him down by his legs. He was then surrounded by another group of activists, stabbed in the stomach and dragged into a lounge while being beaten. A third soldier who was lowered onto the deck saw an activist waiting to attack him with an iron crowbar. After shoving him away, he was attacked by four more activists, one of whom wrapped a chain around his neck and choked him until he lost consciousness. He was then thrown onto the bridge deck, where he was attacked by about twenty activists, who beat him, cut away his equipment, and dragged him into the lounge. The three soldiers were severely wounded and bleeding heavily. Two of the soldiers had their hands tied, and a third was unconscious and went into convulsions. During their captivity, they were subjected to physical and verbal abuse, and photographed and filmed. One of the soldiers said that he was beaten after he began moving and yelling that one of the soldiers needed a doctor, and another said that he was placed onto a couch, beaten, and threatened that he would be beaten every time he moved. Although radical activists attempted to harm them further, more moderate passengers intervened and protected the soldiers. Two were given water and one with a severe stomach wound was given a gauze pad. Hasan Huseyin Uysal, a Turkish doctor, cleaned the blood off their faces and tended to facial cuts.|$|E

500|$|Other {{arms were}} {{associated}} with Arthur. In a manuscript from the later 13th century, Arthur's shield has three gold leopards, a likely heraldic flattery of Edward I of England (Brault, 22). Geoffrey of Monmouth assigned Arthur a dragon on <b>his</b> <b>helmet</b> <b>and</b> standard, which is possibly canting arms on Arthur's father's name, Uther Pendragon (Brault, 23). Geoffrey also assigned Arthur a shield with {{an image of the}} Virgin Mary (Brault, 24). An illustration of the latter by D. Endean Ivall, based on the battle flag described by Nennius (a cross and the Virgin Mary) and including the motto [...] "King Arthur is not dead" [...] in Cornish, {{can be found on the}} cover of W.

He commands Sisko to lower the forcefield and release Tosk, but Sisko refuses. They discuss the issue and the Hunter agrees to place the Bajoran Wormhole out of bounds for future hunts. As much as he detests this practice, Sisko believes that under the Prime Directive he must release Tosk to the aliens.|$|E

500|$|The {{withdrawal}} quickly {{descended into}} {{a scene of}} chaos, as U.S. soldiers scrambled to avoid heavy enemy fire. During the last moments of the battle, Allen was struck {{in the head by}} machine-gun fire which grazed <b>his</b> <b>helmet,</b> <b>and</b> was finally killed when another burst of machine-gun fire hit him. At around 12:20pm Newman flew into Ong Thanh to assume command of the 2nd Battalion, while Coleman took control of the 1st Brigade. Meanwhile, Alpha Company had linked up with Bravo Company, which had taken up positions about [...] to the south of the battalion's night defensive position with the task of assisting the wounded. At around 2:00pm that afternoon, the 2nd Battalion's Charlie Company was airlifted into Ong Thanh from FSB Caisson V, as Bravo Company moved into the battle area to help evacuate the wounded. Coleman, who was coordinating the evacuation of U.S. casualties from a helicopter, decided to assemble the bodies of the dead in an area and protect it with artillery fire. By that stage, however, Triet's 271st Regiment had withdrawn from the battlefield, and medivac flights were only challenged by sporadic sniper fire.|$|E
500|$|Injuries {{have always}} been an {{extremely}} big part of American Football, and various methods have been used historically and in modern times to prevent them. One method {{that has been used}} to prevent injuries is changing the rules of the sport. An early example of this is the elimination of mass formations like the flying wedge in the early 1900s, due to the large number of severe injuries the formations caused. Smaller wedges consisting of three, four, or five players were frequently used on kickoff returns before wedges were limited to two or fewer players in 2009 by the NFL; a similar rule was adopted by the NCAA a year later. The sharp {{decrease in the number of}} catastrophic cervical spine injuries since the mid-1970s has been partially credited to rule changes that modified tackling and blocking techniques. With the increasing awareness of the long-term effects of concussions, the NFL has passed rules prohibiting the targeting of [...] "defenseless" [...] players over-the-shoulder, requiring plays to be blown dead when the runner loses <b>his</b> <b>helmet,</b> <b>and</b> placing more stringent limits to the ability of players who have sustained a concussion to return to play.|$|E
