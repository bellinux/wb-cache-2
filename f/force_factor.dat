5000|$|The {{interacting}} molecular {{structures that}} break {{the structure of}} solvent exchange the heat or the oscillations or the electron clouds on weakening cohesive force (CF) of solvent. However the solvent structure opposes the interaction of solute molecules to maintain its own structures. Thus the friction and triction both are developed. The triction depicts a thermodynamic restriction to break down or disrupt the solvent structure by solute interaction. Contrary to the triction the friction depicts a molecular force restriction. The thermodynamic disruption of solvent structure leads to develop intermolecular forces (IMF). Friccohesity of solute solvent interactions predicts a quantitative disruption of CF and formation of IMF in the same proportion. Thus the friccohesity is kinetic concept materialized through friction and triction both. Thus in solubilization or dispersion sciences the friccohesity predicts a level of solute and solvent interaction through molecular interaction engineering. Friccohesity becomes a most mobile theory to accommodate the geometrical spaces to support the electronic contact between the similar molecules with definite CF and dissimilar molecules or distributing <b>force</b> <b>factor</b> or friction to overcome opposing resistance. The friccohesity becomes a modern model to simulate not only the molecular contact but also successful exchange of the interacting activities in terms of activation energy, entropy, and Gibbs energy defined by triction.|$|E

40|$|The Ecopath {{modelling}} package (EwE) satisfies some of {{the international}} guidelines for promoting an ecosystem-based fisheries management; however, proper definition of ecological management units has not been fully accomplished. The Biological Action Centre (BAC) concept may address this problem. BACs are small, highly productive coastal areas whose productivity is almost constant throughout the year when compared to adjacent zones; thus these areas may sustain large amounts of exploitable biomass. By using EwE {{it was possible to}} characterize the Gulf of Ulloa, Mexico, as a BAC, since it shows high absolute and instantaneous productivity rates, despite sharing certain ecological attributes with upwelling zones. Using temporal (Ecosim) and spatial (Ecospace) dynamic versions of the model, we simulated abundance and distribution patterns of the main fishery resources and key ecological groups in the area. For the blue abalone CPUE time series, the best fitting resulted from the addition of annual sea level anomalies as a <b>forcing</b> <b>factor.</b> Dynamic simulation of biomass time series of the Pacific sardine showed a relatively poor fit, even after introducing <b>forcing</b> <b>factors</b> whose influence on this stock is well documented. The low sensitivity of Ecosim was possibly due to the model’s underlying assumption of the existence of a linear relationship among <b>forcing</b> <b>factors</b> and between <b>forcing</b> <b>factors</b> and sardine stock dynamics. Simulations of geographical distribution patterns of phytoplankton and zooplankton and the estimation of exported biomass from this BAC to adjacent systems using the Ecospace model were very similar to those estimated with alternative methods and data.

40|$|In this paper, a {{comprehensive}} methodology for characterizing the high power resonance behavior of bulk piezoelectric ceramics using the burst method is described. In the burst method, {{the sample is}} electrically driven at its resonance frequency, and then either a short circuit or an open circuit condition is imposed, after which the vibration decays at the resonance or antiresonance frequency, respectively. This decay {{can be used to}} measure the quality factor in either of these conditions. The resulting current in the short circuit vibration condition is related to the vibration velocity through the "force factor. " The generated voltage in the open circuit vibration condition corresponds to the displacement by the "voltage factor. " The <b>force</b> <b>factor</b> and the voltage factor are related to material properties and physical dimensions of the sample. Using this method, the high power behavior of the permittivity, compliance, piezoelectric charge constant, electromechanical coupling factor, and material losses can be determined directly by measuring the resonance (short circuit) and antiresonance (open circuit) frequencies, their corresponding quality factors, the <b>force</b> <b>factor</b> $A$, and the voltage factor $B$.
