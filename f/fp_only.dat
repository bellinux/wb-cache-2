DESIGN: The Mental Health Supplement to the Ontario Health Survey is an epidemiologic, retrospective, home-interview survey. Results reported here are based on responses of a weighted sample of patients aged 15 to 64. SETTING: Ontario, 1990 to 1991. PARTICIPANTS: Random sample of 9953 household residents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardized assessment of mental disorders, associated risk factors and disability, and patterns of use of mental health services. RESULTS: More people seek mental health services from their family physicians (FPs) than from psychiatrists, social workers, or psychologists. Among patients who consulted for mental health purposes, more than 35. 4 % saw <b>FPs</b> <b>only,</b> 24. 7 % saw FPs and other mental health care providers (psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, others), and 40 % saw other mental health care providers only. There were few sociodemographic, diagnostic, or clinical severity differences between the FP-only group and the other two groups. Some evidence suggested FPs saw more recent onset cases, but they were also involved in joint care for more complex or disabled cases. More than 57 % of those seeing FPs received medication; 43 % received other forms of care.

40|$|Recently, Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB) {{signaling}} {{has become}} popular for providing precise location accuracy for mobile and wireless sensor node localization in the indoor environment {{due to its}} large bandwidth and high time resolution while providing ultra-high transmission capacity.

Anatase titanium oxide in the FP / an-TiO 2 nanocomposites underwent an effective modification into rutile polymorphism after calcination at 1000 oC. Although the parent an-TiO 2 nanoparticles changed completely into rutile nanoparticles after calcination at 1000 oC, an-TiO 2 embedded in the FPs / silica / an-TiO 2 nanocomposites retained their structures without any phase transformation into rutile, due to locking the Ti-O species at the interface of TiO 2 domains by the Ti-O-Si units, whose lattice can be formed by the interaction of silica with an-TiO 2 nanoparticles. Even after such a thermal treatment, these nanocomposites displayed a higher photocatalytic activity for the discoloration of methylene blue {{as well as those of}} the corresponding nanocomposites before calcination, although the original an-TiO 2 nanoparticles could not exhibit a photocatalytic ability after calcination.

Since IR-UWB signals have very short duration pulses, they can provide very accurate ranging and positioning capability in short range indoor radio propagation environments. Besides, the high time resolution characteristic of the UWB signal makes the time of arrival (TOA) method {{a good choice for}} location estimation in UWB communications. However, UWB localization and communication have to face lots of challenges like signal acquisition, multipath effects, multi-user interference and NLOS propagation. Among them NLOS propagation introduces positive bias for ranging estimation. Although, with enhanced sampling rates UWB receivers can accomplish high TOA resolution, their operating ranges are typically limited in reduced interference. On the other hand, a suitable alternative to this real-time geometric positioning method is RF fingerprinting (FP) or pattern matching method, where a pre-calculated location database is used to match the properties of the received signal for position estimation. Although the FP method is well suited in positioning under dense multipath conditions, their calculation complexity is huge. Our research emphasis on indoor geo-location using UWB signaling considering both of LOS and NLOS conditions. We also emphasis on a hybrid geo-location combining of precalculation and real-time geo-location approaches, which minimizes the calculation complexity of pre-calculation geo-location while maintaining improved level of geo-location accuracy. Initially, we assume the static indoor conditions, where the furniture inside the room is in fixed positions; lately, we consider the environmental dynamics, i. e. pedestrian movement, to evaluate the performance of the hybrid geo-location. In our proposal, we introduce and investigate a noble approach which makes a hybrid combination of Channel Impulse Response (CIR) -based FP method with polygonal arrangement of reference nodes (or tags) and an iterative-TOA based real-time geo-location method using UWB signaling for wireless ad hoc networks such as PAN, BAN, and RFID as well as wireless sensor nodes.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{lifetime}} {{risk of dying}} from pregnancy or birth related complications are about 245 times higher for women from the Sub Sahara region of Africa as compared to women from Norway. One of the UN’s millennium development goals, MDG 5, is to reduce maternal mortality by 75 % by 2015 and to grant universal access to reproductive health. The keys points for achieving this {{is to increase the}} number of women who give birth aided by a Skilled Healthcare Worker (SHW), increase the number of contacts with Maternal Health Services (MHS), and to increase the use of Family Planning (FP). Purpose We wanted to survey women’s use of MHS in North Tongu district, Volta region in Ghana. We also wanted to examine possible underlying reasons weighing for or against the women’s use of MHS, with the intent of using this information to develop strategies and programs to improve the quality of MHS in the area, and the ultimate goal being to reduce Maternal Mortality Rates (MMR) in the area. Method 92 women, who had given birth within the last 12 months, were interviewed in a partly structured and partly semi-structured survey. We plotted and analyzed our data in SPSS. Our results were compared with literature found searching in PubMed, Cochrane Library and the WHO and UN’s WebPages. Results Almost all the women, 97, 8 %, went for at least one antenatal check during their last pregnancy. Almost ¾ went for 4 checks or more. The large majority of the women went for their first antenatal during their first trimester. Only 27 % gave birth at a hospital in their last pregnancy. Almost 1 / 3 of the women who had given birth at home stated lack of transport as a reason for why they had given birth at home. In the group of women who had not given birth at a hospital, 26 / 67 expressed a desire to do so. Distance in time and km from nearest hospital show a significant increase (p < 0, 05) in number of home births and decrease in hospital births with an increase in distance. Women in polygamous marriages, women not living with their partner and women who have income at their own disposal, show a significant increase (p < 0, 05) in hospital births compared to women in other types of relationships, who are living with their partner and don’t have any income at their own disposal. 81 out of 92 women had attended Postnatal Services (PNS). About ½ of the women stated checking the health of their baby as one of the reasons for going to PNS. Only 7, 4 % stated their own health as a reason for going to PNS. Of all the women, only 14 % reported using any form of FP. Among the women not using FP, about 30 % claimed fear of side effects as a reason for not using it. About ¼ of the women stated financial problems as one of the reasons for not using <b>FP.</b> <b>Only</b> 3 / 92, reported having been treated badly by healthcare professionals. And conversely a large majority of the women stated a positive view of MHS. Conclusion Almost all the 92 Ghanaian women in our survey went for antenatal checks in their last pregnancy, but ¼ of then went less than the 4 times recommended by the WHO. We do not know why some of the women attend to few antenatal checks. The number of women giving birth at a hospital was disappointingly low, and transport problems seems to be one of the main reasons. An increased degree of autonomy among the women is positively correlated with increased numbers of hospital births. In regards to FP it looks as if better information about access, side effects and benefits is needed to increase the small percentage of women using FP. Economy also seems to be a factor preventing women from using FP. PNS was not well enough investigated in our study, but is something deserving a more thorough examination, as about half the women who die in connection with pregnancy and childbirth, do so more than 24 h after birth. Future studies are also needed to examine possible social and cultural aspects that form the women’s attitudes towards MHS. Hopefully this information can be used to develop strategies and programs that can reduce MMR in the area...|$|E

Enhancement of the reporting by general practitioners {{is important to}} improve the sensitivity of notification system. The aim of this work was to evaluate the mandatory notification activities of communicable diseases by general practitioners (GPs) and family pediatricians (FPs) in the Local Health Unit Bari/ 4, during the years 1999 - 2000. This study shows that GPs and <b>FPs</b> notified <b>only</b> 39 % and 28 % of notifiable diseases respectively in 1999 and 2000, although some of these diseases have a very low hospitalization rate. The majority of doctors never notified any case of infectious disease during the period. The study shows also that the doctors who was older and who had larger list of patients had a greater compliance regarding notification. Therefore, a specific training of family doctors and a better facility in the notification procedures (for example, by phone or e-mail) should be very important to improve the sensitivity of surveillance system...|$|R
40|$|Implementing a {{fault-tolerant}} {{state machine}} {{boils down to}} reaching consensus on a sequence of commands. In wide area networks (WANs), where network delays are typically large and unpredictable, choosing the best consensus protocol is difficult. During normal operation, Classic Paxos (CP) requires three message delays, whereas Fast Paxos (<b>FP)</b> requires <b>only</b> two. However, when collisions occur, due to interfering commands issued concurrently, FP requires four extra message delays. In addition, FP uses larger quorums than CP. Therefore, CP can outperform FP in many situations. We present Hybrid Paxos (HP), a consensus protocol that combines the features of FP and CP. HP implements generalized consensus, where collisions are caused only by interfering commands. In the absence of collisions HP requires two message delays, and only one extra message delay otherwise. Our evaluation shows that when collisions are rare, the latency of HP reaches the theoretical minimum. When collisions are frequent, HP behaves like CP...|$|R
40|$|We give a new {{elementary}} {{proof of}} the following theorem: if all critical points of a rational function g belong to the real line then there exists a fractional linear transformation φ such that φ ◦ g is a real rational function. Then we interpret the result in terms of Fuchsian differential equations whose general solution is a polynomial {{and in terms of}} electrostatics. One of the many equivalent formulations of the Shapiro conjecture is the following. Let f = (f 1, [...] .,fp) be a vector of polynomials in one complex variable, and assume that the Wronski determinant W(f) = W(f 1, [...] .,<b>fp)</b> has <b>only</b> real roots. Then there exists a matrix A ∈ GL(p,C) such that fA is a vector of real polynomials.

40|$|Background: There is {{a rising}} public and {{political}} demand for prospective cancer cluster monitoring. But {{there is little}} empirical evidence {{on the performance of}} established cluster detection tests under conditions of small and heterogeneous sample sizes and varying spatial scales, such as are the case for most existing population-based cancer registries. Therefore this simulation study aims to evaluate different cluster detection methods, implemented in the open soure environment R, in their ability to identify clusters of lung cancer using real-life data from an epidemiological cancer registry in Germany. Methods: Risk surfaces were constructed with two different spatial cluster types, representing a relative risk of RR[*]=[*] 2. 0 or of RR[*]=[*] 4. 0, in relation to the overall background incidence of lung cancer, separately for men and women. Lung cancer cases were sampled from this risk surface as geocodes using an inhomogeneous Poisson process. The realisations of the cancer cases were analysed within small spatial (census tracts, N[*]=[*] 1983) and within aggregated large spatial scales (communities, N[*]=[*] 78). Subsequently, they were submitted to the cluster detection methods. The test accuracy for cluster location was determined in terms of detection rates (DR), false-positive (FP) rates and positive predictive values. The Bayesian smoothing models were evaluated using ROC curves. Results: With moderate risk increase (RR[*]=[*] 2. 0), local cluster tests showed better DR (for both spatial aggregation scales[*]>[*] 0. 90) and lower FP rates (both[*]<[*] 0. 05) than the Bayesian smoothing methods. When the cluster RR was raised four-fold, the local cluster tests showed better DR with lower <b>FPs</b> <b>only</b> for the small spatial scale. At a large spatial scale, the Bayesian smoothing methods, especially those implementing a spatial neighbourhood, showed a substantially lower FP rate than the cluster tests. However, the risk increases at this scale were mostly diluted by data aggregation. Conclusion: High resolution spatial scales seem more appropriate as data base for cancer cluster testing and monitoring than the commonly used aggregated scales. We suggest the development of a two-stage approach that combines methods with high detection rates as a first-line screening with methods of higher predictive ability at the second stage. <br...|$|R
