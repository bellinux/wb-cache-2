5000|$|William R. Wallace {{reacted to}} the jumping with an angry letter, {{partially}} quoted above to describe what the company considered <b>improper</b> <b>action</b> by the GLO. The letter closed, “The higher courts will ere long decide {{the validity of the}} claimants." [...] With this letter and several others, Wallace took the stance of an aggrieved party in relation to the GLO’s handling of the Sioux scrip. It has been documented that the under-staffed and poorly-run GLO was indeed involved in corrupt dealings at that time. [...] Continuing their aggressive stance, the Wallace Townsite Company filed 13 legal suits, demanding $1,000 from citizens it claimed had illegally jumped their properties. Several years passed before all the disputes were fully resolved. Fortunately, land holders who had legitimately developed their plots were able to gain clear title. By the time the disputes were concluded, William R. Wallace had opened an office in Spokane to pursue mining ventures in the West.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{clearance}} for final approach, landing gear and flaps (5 degrees) were extended. The {{flight data recorder}} (FDR) indicated the airspeed had slowed to 145 kn. The captain then called for the flaps to be increased to 15 degrees. The airspeed continued to slow to 135 kn. Six seconds later, the aircraft's stick shaker activated, warning of an impending stall as the speed continued to slow to 131 kn. The captain responded by abruptly pulling back on the control column, followed by increasing thrust to 75% power, instead of lowering the nose and applying full power, which was the proper stall recovery technique. That <b>improper</b> <b>action</b> pitched the nose up even further, increasing both the g-load and the stall speed. The stick pusher activated ("The Q400 stick pusher applies an airplane-nose-down control column input to decrease the wing angle-of-attack AOA after an aerodynamic stall"), but the captain overrode the stick pusher and continued pulling back on the control column. The first officer retracted the flaps without consulting the captain, making recovery even more difficult.|$|E
5000|$|As to {{the first}} set of cases, Publius {{explains}} that in a Union, there will necessarily be certain things that the States are prohibited from doing, such as the prohibition on coining money. [...] Given this, he states that there must be some way {{for the federal government to}} enforce these prohibitions, and so it must be the authority of federal courts to overrule <b>improper</b> <b>action</b> by the States. [...] As he puts it, “the States, by the plan of the convention, are prohibited from doing a variety of things, some of which are incompatible with the interests of the Union, and others with the principles of good government.” In other words, the interests of the whole nation require certain limits on the states. Hamilton offers the example of coining money, which was forbidden to the states but was done anyway. The only logical way to prevent such violations was to allow federal courts to hear such cases, since state courts would presumably rule in favor of their own state.1 ...|$|E
5000|$|In the {{heterarchy}} {{and fully}} distributed architecture, each behavior has {{a set of}} pre-conditions to be met {{before it can be}} performed, and a set of post-conditions that will be true after the action has been performed. These pre- and post-conditions determine the order in which behaviors must be performed and are used to causally connect action modules. This enables each module to receive input from other modules {{as well as from the}} sensors, so modules can recruit each other. For example, if the agent’s goal were to reduce thirst, the behavior [...] "drink" [...] would require the pre-condition of having water available, so the module would activate the module in charge of [...] "find water". The activations organize the behaviors into a sequence, even though only one action is performed at a time. The distribution of larger behaviors across modules makes this system flexible and robust to noise. [...] Some critics of this model hold that any existing set of division rules for the predecessor and conflictor connections between modules produce sub-par action selection. In addition, the feedback loop used in the model can in some circumstances lead to <b>improper</b> <b>action</b> selection.|$|E

5000|$|In {{an appeal}} {{on the record}} from a {{decision}} in a judicial proceeding, both appellant and respondent are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal. Each seeks {{to prove to the}} higher court that the result they desired was the just result. Precedent and case law figure prominently in the arguments. In order for the appeal to succeed, the appellant must prove that the lower court committed reversible error, that is, an impermissible action by the court acted to cause a result that was unjust, and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly. Some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case, permitting seriously improper argument by an attorney, admitting or excluding evidence improperly, acting outside the court's jurisdiction, injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so, juror misconduct, etc. The failure to formally object at the time, to what one views as <b>improper</b> <b>action</b> in the lower court, may result in the affirmance of the lower court's judgment on the grounds that one did not [...] "preserve the issue for appeal" [...] by objecting.|$|E
5000|$|The Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee {{also began}} {{hearings}} on Whitewater in July 1994. These hearings intensified in May 1995, following the Republican gain of control, when the Republican Banking Committee chairman Al D'Amato also became {{chair of the}} newly formed Special Whitewater Committee. The Whitewater committee's hearings were much more extensive than those held previously by the Democrats, running for 300 hours over 60 sessions across 13 months, and taking over 10,000 pages of testimony and 35,000 pages of depositions from almost 250 people. The hearings' testimony and senatorial lines of investigation mostly followed partisan lines, with Republicans investigating the President and the Democrats defending him. The Senate Special Whitewater Committee issued an 800-page majority report on June 18, 1996, which only hinted at one possible <b>improper</b> <b>action</b> by President Clinton, but spoke of the Clinton Administration as [...] "an American presidency that misused its power, circumvented the limits on its authority and attempted to manipulate the truth". The first lady came in for much stronger criticism, as she was [...] "the central figure" [...] {{in all aspects of}} the alleged wrongdoings. The Democratic minority on the Committee called these findings [...] "a legislative travesty", [...] "a witch hunt", and [...] "a political game".|$|E
50|$|Effects of {{diffusion}} of responsibility on escalation tendency {{show that in}} the initial stages of group projects there is reduced escalation effects in those individuals who take the inaugural steps in a failing project than individuals who are personally held reliable for those initial decisions. Self justification theory is of lower importance in groups than in individuals because most decisions in organizations are taken by groups in form of new policies and regulations. When decisions fail, people subjectively disfigure consequences to make themselves appear more agreeable. This distortion occurs when people try to psychologically safeguard themselves in an attempt to rationalize their actions. People try to justify actions taken previously in the past which leads them to take a failing course of action. Though these actions taken previously lead to escalated commitment, a decision to stay in the same course of action could be damaged by {{the extent to which a}} person shares the responsibility for initiating that failing course of action. Even after participating in a decision, an individual can evade responsibility in two ways. The first is where the responsibility or the blame is transferred to the third party for <b>improper</b> <b>action.</b> In this case, a person feels less responsible for the failure caused by them along with the inclination to the failing project. The other way to evade responsibility is when the group takes the initial decision of pursuing the failing project. The blame of a poor decision is shared within the group, allocating less responsibility to each member for the decision than it would have been if the decision was made by one person alone. Social interaction may curtail the propensity to escalate commitment to a defeated course of action by diffusing responsibility for the original decision and discouraging the arousal of intentions to justify previous behavior.|$|E
