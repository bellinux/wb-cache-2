5|$|It is {{important}} not to over-interpret these diagrams. Nothing is implied about how a particle gets from one point to another. The diagrams do not <b>imply</b> that the particles are moving in straight or curved lines. They do not <b>imply</b> that the particles are moving with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight one does not <b>imply</b> that it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, somehow, move from point to point and electrons, somehow, emit and absorb photons. The theory does not explain how these things happen, but it does tell us the probabilities of these things happening in various situations.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse and empirically test how to unlock {{volatility}} information from option prices. The information content of three option based forecasts of volatility: Black- Scholes <b>implied</b> volatility, model-free <b>implied</b> volatility and corridor <b>implied</b> volatility is addressed, with the ultimate plan of proposing a new volatility index for the Italian stock market. As for model-free <b>implied</b> volatility, two different extrapolation techniques are implemented. As for corridor <b>implied</b> volatility, five different corridors are compared. Our results, which point to a better performance of corridor <b>implied</b> volatilities with respect to both Black-Scholes <b>implied</b> volatility and model-free <b>implied</b> volatility, are in favour of narrow corridors. The volatility index proposed is obtained with an overall 50...|$|R

5|$|Non-reductive Physicalism is {{the view}} that mental {{properties}} form a separate ontological class to physical properties: mental states (such as qualia) are not reducible to physical states.

50|$|Thus, the net {{volatility}} calculated above is, in fact, the <b>implied</b> {{volatility of}} this synthetic forward option. While {{it may seem}} counter-intuitive that one can create a synthetic option whose <b>implied</b> volatility {{is lower than the}} <b>implied</b> volatilities of its components, consider that the first <b>implied</b> volatility, 18.1%, corresponds to the period from today to May expiration, while the second <b>implied</b> volatility, 14.3% corresponds to the period from today to September expiration. Therefore, the <b>implied</b> volatility for the period May to September must be less than 14.3% to compensate for the higher <b>implied</b> volatility during the period to May.|$|R

5|$|The Italian theologian Francesco Antonio Zaccaria criticised Augustine's {{concept of}} {{evil in the}} eighteenth century. He noted a {{distinction}} between using the term evil to <b>imply</b> blame (sin) and to <b>imply</b> lament (suffering) and argued that Augustine posited sin to have occurred before suffering. This was problematic for Zaccaria, who believed that it made Augustine seem offhand and uninterested in human suffering. For Zaccaria, Augustine's perception of evil as a privation did not satisfactorily answer the questions of modern society as to why suffering exists.|$|E

Second, how does <b>implied</b> volatility behave as a function of strike and expiry?

The findings provide evidence that <b>implied</b> volatility is not an efficient estimate of realised volatility. <b>Implied</b> volatility creates overpricing, for both call and put options, in the Greek market. This is an indication of inefficiency for the market. In addition, we find evidence that realised volatility ‘Granger causes’ <b>implied</b> volatility for call options, and <b>implied</b> volatility of call options ‘Granger causes’, the <b>implied</b> volatility of put option...|$|R
