40|$|The parapatric sibling ant species Temnothorax nylanderi and T. crassispinus {{hybridize}} in {{the contact}} {{zone in the}} Franconian Jura, Southern Germany. Aim of our {{study was to investigate}} the impact of <b>hybridization</b> <b>on</b> <b>colony</b> composition and fitness. We classified colonies as either ‘pure’ or containing hybrids by determining their allozyme pattern at GPI, an enzyme that is fixed for different alleles in the two parental species, and quantified their reproductive output. Most colonies with hybrid workers had a T. crassispinus queen. Colonies with heterozygous, hybrid workers produced more young workers than colonies of the parental species but similar numbers of male and female sexuals. Female sexuals from colonies with heterozygous workers had a significantly lower weight than female sexuals from pure colonies. Only a single reproductive queen was found to be heterozygous, suggesting reduced fitness of hybrid queens. As in the parental species, hybrid colonies appear to be frequently taken over by alien queens, which obscures the genetic colony structure...|$|E
40|$|The present-day range {{distribution}} of many species has {{been influenced by}} re-occuring glacials of the past. By the retreat into different refugia situated in more southerly regions, species were geographically separated and sometimes diverged into separate lineages. After having re-occupied their formerly ice-covered habitats, these species pairs nowadays often exhibit parapatric distribution and some hybridize along their contact zones. Such a scenario probably also accounts for {{the origin of the}} very common monogynous and monandrous ant sibling species Temnothorax nylanderi and T. crassispinus. While the latter inhabits Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, T. nylanderi can be found in Western Europe. They occasionally hybridize along a narrow contact zone in North-Western Germany. In this study, using morphometry and genetic markers, the position of the contact zone in Southern Germany and Northern Italy was determined. The differentiation within and between the two species was analysed and the genetic structure of Central and South European T. nylanderi populations was compared. Further, the impact of <b>hybridization</b> <b>on</b> <b>colony</b> level was studied in detail. Previous findings were confirmed, that T. nylanderi can be exclusively found in Western and T. crassispinus in Eastern Europe, separated by a small zone of overlap. In Bavaria, the contact zone is situated along the Franconian Jura. South of the Alps, it probably lies somewhere in North-Eastern Italy, because in Slovenia and Croatia, only T. crassispinus has been found. The contact zone therefore runs far more west than expected from previous results. The genetic division between the species was constant with 2. 4 % and 3. 5 % divergence in the CO &# 921; and Cyt b haplotypes, suggesting that the species might have split 1. 5 - 2 Myr ago. Both species exhibited genetic uniformity on the nuclear and mitochondrial level. Their haplotypes revealed a lack of geographical origin, indicating rapid post-glacial recolonization. Further population genetic studies using microsatellite markers on several Central and South European T. nylanderi populations revealed equal rates of heterogenous (two or more matrilines) colonies due to colony fusion, a typical characteristic of this species. Thus, also in southern populations, colony odour appears to be mainly environmentally determined. Besides that, no bottleneck-induced north-south differences in genetic variability could be proofed. The significant inbreeding in both South and North European populations is probably a species-specific trait. It might result from random mating over time and habitat patchiness. As the sibling species are morphologically very similar, hybrids were classified by heterozygosity at the diagnostic allozyme locus GPI. Like in Northern Germany, both species co-occured in a rather narrow contact zone, which does not extend over more than 25 km. The narrowness of the contact zone apparently demonstrates hybrid inferiority. This was further confirmed by the detailed analysis of the hybrid zone, were almost no fertile hybrid queens were found. Pure hybrid colonies, consisting of exclusively heterozgous workers were rare. Instead most colonies contained both hybrid and T. crassispinus workers and co-occurred with pure T. crassispinus colonies. Besides that, the weight of hybrid virgin queens, which were as abundant as pure species� gynes (mostly T. crassispinus), is apparently negatively influenced by hybridization. However not directly, because co-occuring homozygous queens in hybrid colonies were also lighter. Mating was found to be almost exclusively unidirectional according to mitochondrial DNA data. Mixed hybrid colonies apparently originate by colony fusions between pure and hybrid lineages, as other reasons can be ruled out. The existence of interspecific colony fusions in nature has been additionally supported by laboratory experiments, where heterospecific fusions could be documented. This is probably facilitated by the high relatedness between the species and the environmentally influenced nestmate discrimination. Hybridization between the sibling species T. crassispinus and T. nylanderi apparently leads to an evolutionary dead-end. However {{it does not seem to}} be too costly, as hybrid colonies produced slightly more workers than pure species colonies...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} potential pathogenic Escherichia coli strains isolated from diarrheic hens and chickens originating from intensive battery rearing in North Algeria, {{the presence of}} a large range of virulence factors and markers was studied in 50 strains by DNA-DNA <b>hybridization</b> <b>on</b> <b>colonies</b> and phenotypic tests. The sequences we focused on were those coding for adhesins F 5, F 41, F 17, Pap, Afa, and Sfa; intimin Eae; and toxins STa, STb, LT 1, Stx 1, Stx 2, CNF 1, and CNF 2. The phenotypes explored were the colicins, aerobactin, hemolysins, and hemagglutinin production and serum resistance. The genotypic and phenotypic tests enabled us to categorize the isolates into two distinct groups: those with a potential to invade the host (27 strains were serum resistant and/or produced aerobactin), among which three strains were also potentially diarrheagenic, one strain was LT 1 + F 17 + Afa+ Pap+ (enterotoxigenic E. coli) and the two others were Stx 1 (verotoxigenic E. coli). Twenty-three strains were colicinogenic, including 19 strains producing colicin V. This latter factor was also detected in isolates negative for the other virulence factors. On the basis of the type of erythrocytes agglutinated, we established 14 mannose-resistant hemagglutination patterns among the 37 strains tested, including 22 serum-resistant and/or aerobactin producing strains and 15 strains negative for these two characters. None of the strains produced alpha hemolysin, whereas two strains produced beta hemolysin and enterohemolysin, respectively. Congo red fixation was observed in 25 strains. No relationship could be detected between Congo red fixation and the presence of other virulence markers, such as serum resistance and aerobactin production. This study shows that among isolates originating from the feces of diarrheic chickens, the proportion of potentially diarrheagenic E. coli strains is low. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Preferential use of {{particular}} V gene {{families in the}} response to specific antigens has been demonstrated in several systems. The lack of responses to certain types of antigens, therefore, could {{be the result of}} deletion of or failure to express some V genes. Because CBA/N mice, which carry the X-linked immunodeficiency (xid) gene defect, {{have been shown to be}} unresponsive to thymus-independent polysaccharide antigens, it was of interest to examine if this unresponsiveness could be accounted for by abnormal expression {{of particular}} V gene families. Using in situ <b>hybridization</b> <b>on</b> B cell <b>colonies,</b> we determined the expression of nine V gene families in CBA/CaHN females (genotypically normal), CBA/N males (xid) and females (xid), and (CBA/N x CBA/CaHN) F 1 males (xid) and females (phenotypically normal). Our results indicate that V gene family expression, including the S 107 family, in CBA/N males and Fl males, is similar to that of CBA/CaHN and Fi females with predominant expression of J 558, the largest gene family, in all individuals. Interestingly, CBA/N female mice, which carry two defective X chromosomes, as a group expressed significantly reduced levels of the J 558 gene family, and as individuals showed variation in which family was predominantly expressed. We conclude that the unresponsiveness of mice with the xid defect to polysaccharide antigens can not be attribute...|$|R
