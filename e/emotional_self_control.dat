In this context our paper aims to investigate self esteem level to 21 {{abused children}} from an Emergency Reception Centre in order to develop a possible framework for a counselling program. Our findings obtained by documents analysis, observation, self esteem scale and questionnaire indicated that all investigated subjects developed cognitive, affective and behavioural disorders, 81 % have a low self esteem and 59 % have a low <b>emotional</b> <b>self</b> <b>control.</b> Another important finding is the presence of irrational thoughts about themselves, the others and the future (career and family foundation).

40|$|Employability is {{referred}} to as the relative potential of an individual to obtain and retain suitable employment in the labour market. Success in higher education is an effective way of enhancing the employability of youth. Competitiveness of examinations has added in to the challenges and aspirations of youth. The objective of the study was to examine the impact of high school students' emotional intelligence (EI) for their Training (study) approaches and employability potential. Eighty five high school (Advanced Level) students (40 girls, and 45 boys) were randomly selected from two high schools in Sri Lanka. They were preparing in three different subject streams for the university entrance examination. Emotional intelligence of the respondents was measured through Genos EI Inventory. Respondents' training (study) approaches were assessed through the 'revised two-factor Study Process Questionnaire' of Biggs et. al. SPSS computer software was employed for descriptive and inferential analysis of data. The employability potential of the students was assessed based on their academic performances. Emotional intelligence, and the Training (study) approaches (motives, and strategies) used by the respondents were assessed. Relationships were sought with students' employability potential (academic performances). High school girls revealed deeper training (study) approaches and their academic performances were superior to the boys. There was no significant impact of EI level to the training (study) process behavior of the respondents, and to their employability potential (academic performances). However, findings revealed a positive relationship between the <b>Emotional</b> <b>Self</b> <b>Control</b> and Employability potential (Academic performances) of high school students. This warrants further analysis, especially in a cultural context. It implies a competitive advantage (employability potential) for students with a better control of self emotions. This has the potential to generate a practical sense in academic and corporate environments alike. Further research is recommended on varying socio-cultural, and demographic segments...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this case study is to analyze the {{relationship}} between the levels of <b>emotional</b> intelligence (selfawareness, <b>self</b> <b>control,</b> selfmotivation, empathy and social skills) and skills competency and personal development of secondary school counselors in Johor. Sixty secondary school counselors were randomly selected as respondents. The study was carried out quantitatively using questionnaires as instruments to obtain data. The study shows that majority of the respondents have moderate level of emotional intelligence and high level of skills competency and personal development. In addition, it is also found that the relationship of emotional intelligence (selfawareness, selfcontrol, selfmotivation, empathy and social skills) and skills competency is at medium strong level. Meanwhile, emotional intelligence (selfawareness, selfcontrol, selfmotivation, empathy and social skills) has a strong and significant relationship with personal development.

Thus, this study seeks to investigate <b>emotional</b> <b>self</b> awareness and information literacy competence as correlates of task performance among personnel in academic libraries in Edo state, Nigeria. The survey research design was employed for the study with a population size of 181 library personnel in the 15 academic libraries under study and total enumeration was adopted as the sampling technique.

40|$|While {{models of}} <b>self</b> <b>control</b> {{problems}} have proliferated in recent years, {{there have been}} few corresponding advances in measurement. We develop a survey instrument to measure <b>self</b> <b>control</b> problems and apply it to a sample of highly educated adults. Measured <b>self</b> <b>control</b> relates in the anticipated manner to wealth accumulation and standard personality measures. Yet while <b>self</b> <b>control</b> problems are typically seen as resulting in over-consumption and low wealth, we identify a significant group who under-consume and thereby accumulate high levels of wealth. In addition, <b>self</b> <b>control</b> problems are found to be smaller in scale for older than for younger respondents. Those who put money aside in retirement accounts may be delaying access to a point at which <b>self</b> <b>control</b> problems are no longer important.

40|$|Abstract: Given the {{availability}} of products and programs designed to moderate desire for consumption, how would a utility maximizing consumer choose to allocate her budget between ordinary consumption and a <b>self</b> <b>control</b> technology that limits how much consumption she wants? Faced with this trade-off between hedonic pleasure from ordinary consumption and effective, yet costly, reduction of desire, the model characterizes consumer demand for <b>self</b> <b>control</b> and its responsiveness to price and income. In contrast to models of <b>self</b> <b>control</b> in the behavioral economics literature that focus on temptation among multiple selves and time-inconsistent sequential choice, the static endogenous preference model in this paper focuses on the deliberative process of choosing how much desire-reducing technology to employ. <b>Self</b> <b>control</b> is represented as {{a reduction in the}} threshold above which ordinary consumption must be maintained to avoid discontentment. <b>Self</b> <b>control</b> turns out to be an inferior good over a large subset of the exogenous parameter space and responds non-monotonically (and sometimes discontinuously) to changes in price, leading to counterintuitive consumer responses to subsidies and positive supply shocks. The model helps interpret disappointing consumer responses to credit counseling, financial literacy programs, and products aimed at improving financial decision making through cultivation of <b>self</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R

Ten adolescent inpatients (5 male/ 5 female), residing within the Adolescent Unit of the State Hospital of a Southwestern state, were selected as subjects. Subjects ranged in age from 12 to 17 years and were paid volunteers. Subjects were assessed pretreatment for non <b>self</b> <b>controlled</b> behavior via the teacher rated <b>Self</b> <b>Control</b> Rating Scale (Kendall & Wilcox, 1979). This measure also served as the blocking variable utilized for random assignment to treatment or control group. Five adolescents were assigned to each group. Pretreatment measures of social perspective taking (Chandler Bystander Cartoons; Chandler, 1973) and social problem solving (Means-Ends Problem Solving test: Platt & Spivack, 1975) were taken additionally. All three measures were repeated at posttreatment and at 4 week follow-up. Treatment consisted of twelve 60 -minute sessions held 3 times a week over the period of 4 weeks. The treatment consisted of a group application of Kendall's (1980) Cognitive-Behavioral <b>Self</b> <b>Control</b> therapy. The main treatment strategies included: (1) a problem solving approach, (2) self instructional training, (3) behavioral contingencies, (4) modeling, (5) affective education, and (6) role play exercises. The separate strategies were essentially interwoven. Except for the cognitive-behavioral <b>self</b> <b>control</b> training proper, subjects in both treatment and control groups were given similar tasks, task instructions, and performance feedback. Results found a range of behavioral <b>self</b> <b>control</b> skills distributed among the subjects but failed to support the hypothesis of associated poor social perspective taking and social problem solving skills. Treatment failed to improve teacher ratings of behavioral <b>self</b> <b>control</b> at posttreatment and at follow-up. Likewise, no significant improvement was found in social problem solving skills at posttreatment or follow-up, although a trend toward improvement was suggested. A significant improvement in social perspective taking skills was found in the treatment group at posttreatment. The improvement was maintained at 4 week follow-up.
