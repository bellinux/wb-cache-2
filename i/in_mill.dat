5|$|Michael Woodruff {{was born}} on 3 April 1911 <b>in</b> <b>Mill</b> Hill, London, England. In 1913, his father, Harold Woodruff, a {{professor}} of veterinary medicine at the Royal Veterinary College in London, moved the family to Australia so he could take up the post of Professor of Veterinary Pathology and Director of the Veterinary Institute at the University of Melbourne. The elder Woodruff later became the Professor of Bacteriology. The family's new life in Australia was interrupted by World War I, which prompted Harold to enlist in the armed services. He became {{an officer in the}} Australian Army Veterinary Corps and was sent to Egypt.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} nitrogen (N) level on iron (Fe) content <b>in</b> <b>milled</b> rice, a field experiment was carried out under three N application levels including 0, 150 and 300 kg/hm 2 by using 120 rice genotypes. In addition to the genotypic differences of iron content <b>in</b> <b>milled</b> rice, grain yield, 1000 -grain weight and N content in grains under the same N level, there were also variations in the response of Fe content <b>in</b> <b>milled</b> rice to N levels. Based on the range and variation coefficient of Fe content <b>in</b> <b>milled</b> rice under the three N levels, the response of Fe content <b>in</b> <b>milled</b> rice to N levels could be classified into four types including highly insensitive, insensitive, sensitive and highly sensitive types. A significant quadratic correlation {{was found between the}} Fe content <b>in</b> <b>milled</b> rice and 1000 -grain weight or the N content in grains. However, no significant correlation between the Fe content <b>in</b> <b>milled</b> rice and grain yield was detected. In conclusion, there are genotypic differences in the effects of N levels on Fe content <b>in</b> <b>milled</b> rice, which is favorable to breeding of Fe-rich rice under different N environments. Furthermore, high yield and Fe-rich rice could be grown through the regulation of nitrogen on Fe content <b>in</b> <b>milled</b> rice, 1000 -grain weight and N content <b>in</b> <b>milled</b> rice...|$|R

5|$|The Ministry of Defence {{launched}} Project MoDEL (Ministry of Defence Estates London) in 2006 {{to consolidate}} {{many of its}} London-based operations at RAF Northolt. Under the project, RAF Bentley Priory, RAF Uxbridge, RAF West Ruislip, RAF Eastcote and the Inglis Barracks <b>in</b> <b>Mill</b> Hill were all closed between 2006 and 2010 with any remaining units transferring to Northolt. The Air Historical Branch, originally established in 1919 to provide a record of air activity during the First World War, was also relocated to RAF Northolt from RAF Bentley Priory in 2008 {{as part of this}} project. As a result, the station has been extensively redeveloped with new facilities to support these operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{natural harbour}} of the Haven {{was known as}} a safe port and was {{exploited}} for several historical military operations throughout the second millennium.

Following the relocation of the British Forces Post Office and Defence Courier Service from Mill Hill, a new headquarters and main sorting facility were built for their use which opened in November 2007. New hangar facilities for the use of No. 32 Squadron were also constructed, along with new personnel accommodation.|$|E

5|$|Lucas {{spent the}} rest of 1971 and early 1972 trying to raise {{financing}} for the American Graffiti script. During this time, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures all turned down the opportunity to co-finance and distribute the film. Lucas, Huyck and Katz rewrote the second draft together, which, in addition to Modesto, was also set <b>in</b> <b>Mill</b> Valley and Los Angeles. Lucas also intended to end American Graffiti showing a title card detailing the fate of the characters, including the death of Milner and the disappearance of Toad in Vietnam. Huyck and Katz found the ending depressing and were incredulous that Lucas planned to include only the male characters. Lucas argued that mentioning the girls meant adding another title card, which he felt would prolong the ending. Because of this, Pauline Kael later accused Lucas of chauvinism.|$|E

The St Pancras railway station and the Abbey Mills Pumping Stations were used for Arkham's interiors. University College London was used for courtrooms. Some scenes, including the Tumbler pursuit, were filmed in Chicago at locations such as Lower Wacker Drive and 35 East Wacker. Authorities agreed to raise Franklin Street Bridge for a scene where access to the Narrows is closed.|$|E
5|$|Other {{industries}} in the town included brick making and chimney pot manufacture. Raw materials were sourced from local collieries. <b>In</b> <b>Mill</b> Street carts, waggons, and bicycles were manufactured from 1855, and elsewhere motor vehicles were also produced until the late 1950s. John Cockerill moved to the town from Haslingden before leaving for continental Europe to become the founder of Cockerill-Sambre. James Cockerill, employed Radcliffe man William Yates as his manager. Several foundries and machine manufacturers were located around the town, including Dobson and Barlow at Bradley Fold, and Wolstenholme's along Bridgewater Street. Munitions, aircraft and tank components were manufactured during the Second World War. Chemicals were manufactured by companies such as Bealey's and J. & W. Whewell.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFinite {{amplitude}} stability due {{to process}} damping is an intermediate state between fully stable and fully unstable vibrations in machining. In this state, the amplitude of vibration increases and stabilizes {{at a certain}} magnitude before the tool disengages from the cut. In the literature, this phenomenon has been studied experimentally and by conducting numerical simulations in turning, but {{to the best of}} our knowledge, it has not been reported <b>in</b> <b>milling.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, the existence of this phenomenon <b>in</b> <b>milling</b> is investigated experimentally and numerically. In addition, an amplitude-dependent formulation of process damping is integrated into the Semi Discretization Method of computing stability lobes to determine the borders of finite amplitude stability region <b>in</b> <b>milling.</b> Both the experimental evidence and numerical simulations showed the finite amplitude stability to also occur <b>in</b> <b>milling.</b> Moreover, the accuracy of the presented Semi Discretization Method in the prediction of finite amplitude stability region is verified by the experimental results and numerical simulations...|$|R
