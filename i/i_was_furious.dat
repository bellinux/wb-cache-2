2500|$|I {{spent the}} whole process in a wheelchair, so {{physically}} I was really frustrated. I think my vocal performance on it is pretty poor. It sounds tired and strained. The saving grace of the album was [...] "Candy Store Rock" [...] and [...] "Achilles Last Stand". The rhythm section on {{that it was so}} inspired ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> with Page and [...] Peter Grant. I was just furious that I couldn't get back to the woman and the children that I loved. And I was thinking, is all this rock'n'roll worth anything at all? ...|$|E
2500|$|Both Murray and Richard Dreyfuss have {{confirmed}} in separate interviews {{that they did}} not get along with each other during the making of What About Bob? In addition, the film's producer Laura Ziskin recalled having a disagreement with Murray that led to him tossing her into a lake. [...] Ziskin confirmed in 2003, [...] "Bill also threatened to throw me across the parking lot and then broke my sunglasses and threw them across the parking lot.

6000|$|... "You {{are very}} stupid," [...] she sighed. [...] "I {{deliberately}} invited your embrace. Your withholding it would simply {{have added to}} my humiliation. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>furious</b> with myself, simply because, although I have lived {{a great part of}} my life with men, on equal terms with them, working with them, playing with them, seeing more of them at all times than of my own sex, such a thing has never happened to me before." ...|$|R
50|$|Niko: When was {{the check}} dated?Natasha: The 20th. I could not {{remember}} the date at the moment. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> too <b>furious.</b> So <b>I</b> put the 20th.Niko: That was yesterday, Friday.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> with Strickland, and was indignant with myself, because Dirk Stroeve cut such {{an absurd}} figure that I felt {{inclined}} to laugh.|$|E
60|$|I was not blushing, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>furious.</b> It {{was really}} too bad of Alicia, {{although}} I don't see why I need have cared.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Max!--don't kill me, Max! It was laudanum--indeed it was. You {{were going}} to be married, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>furious,</b> and I went and got--" ...|$|E
5000|$|They {{had been}} {{sleeping}} in houses, in warm beds. They had shiny shoes, pristine ironed uniforms and waxed moustaches. They even had heating in their cars. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so <b>furious</b> with them.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Empty speeches,' I {{interrupted}} her. 'Hiding {{their fears}} behind imbecile hopes. They are all great Parliamentarians there--on the English model, as you know.' <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so <b>furious</b> that <b>I</b> could hardly speak. She {{made a gesture}} of despair.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> growing <b>furious.</b> <b>I</b> pursued: [...] "And I'll {{tell you}} what: if I {{could do it}} I wouldn't." [...] Then {{throwing}} off all restraint, I added: [...] "You are {{a bit too much}} of a Jacobus, Mr. Jacobus." ...|$|R
60|$|Maude giggled, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>furious.</b> And {{no sooner}} were we {{outside the gates}} than I {{declared}} I should never again enter a private residence by the back door.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do? I rode off at five in {{the morning}} to talk to Master Jerry, with a new lash on my whip. Oh, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>furious!</b> Witchmaster or no Witchmaster, I meant to--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go upstairs!" [...] I {{whispered to}} her. She shook her head. I {{could see him}} taking heavy breaths, and the veins of his neck were swelling. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> at her disobedience.|$|E
60|$|O, I {{had found}} myself at last, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> making a <b>furious,</b> joyous {{use of the}} discovery.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} it would really be a mercy, Bullen, if you were to pour a bucket of water over my head, when the bugle sounds. I have no doubt <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> <b>furious</b> with you, and should use the strongest of strong language; but still, that would not hurt you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then she {{followed}} me to ... to your sister-in-law's. And {{she came up}} and made another scene. Then I lost my head. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so <b>furious,</b> <b>I</b> don't know what <b>I</b> said. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mad. <b>I</b> told her I'd have nothing {{more to do with}} her.... Oh, I can't bear it, I can't bear it.|$|R
60|$|That was a tactful {{thing to}} say to ME, who had refused Max Irving so often that I had lost count. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>furious,</b> and so I smiled most sweetly on my maddening aunt.|$|E
60|$|I {{put my hand}} to my sword to draw it, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> too; I {{pulled at}} the hilt, but I felt a hand catch hold of mine and prevent me. I struggled; then I heard Checco in my ear.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was what}} made me so furious," [...] she admitted, shyly. [...] "I was {{surprised}} when you grabbed me off Wildfire. And my heart beat--beat--beat so when you hugged me.

6000|$|... "It is so {{hard for}} me," [...] she murmured, [...] "I {{do not want to}} marry yet. I do not wish to think of it.

6000|$|... "It's all right, Marsh. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a <b>furious</b> idiot, or I {{should have}} let you explain at once. But you see I had only one thought in my mind, {{and that was my}} luck, which I wanted to share with you; and when your father seemed to have come in between us again--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are the dearest {{man in the}} world," [...] she exclaimed, {{her lips}} still quivering, [...] "but, as you say, you know the answer. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> always in love with Henry. It <b>was</b> because <b>I</b> loved him that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so <b>furious.</b> <b>I</b> liked you {{so much that it}} was mean of me ever to think of--of what so nearly happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>furious.</b> I {{threatened}} the Sagoth leader {{with all sorts}} of dire reprisals; but when he heard me speak the hybrid language that is the medium of communication between his kind and the human race of the inner world he only grinned, as much as to say, [...] "I thought so!" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>furious.</b> After {{a period}} of bitter {{brooding}} I rebelled, and took the matter up with the Commander-in-Chief. I argued, [...] "As I am not only doing a man's work on a boy's pay but actually superintending the stock and tools, I am entitled to certain individual rights {{in the choice of}} a hat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not to mother; but to {{hear him}} and Miss Parsons is enough to drive one wild. They went on such a dreadful way {{yesterday}} that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>furious,</b> and so glad to get away to Kenminster; only after I had set off, he came running after me, and I knew what that would be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I was; but he {{had just}} struck me and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in a <b>furious</b> passion; {{but that was a}} {{different}} thing altogether to shooting a man in cold blood." ...|$|R
60|$|Ant. <b>I</b> confess <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{somewhat}} too <b>furious</b> at first, but {{you will}} forgive the transport of my passion; now I have considered it better, I have a qualm of conscience.|$|R
5000|$|Andrews {{also said}} during another interview, {{that after the}} surgery, [...] "I started singing in a nightclub shortly after the {{operation}} and that's when my voice began to lower and lower on me. <b>I</b> should have <b>been</b> <b>furious</b> with that careless doctor but how can <b>I</b> when he <b>is</b> a lot responsible for the upturn of my career!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was. My dear, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>furious!</b> I had had {{the keys}} for ten months, and I'd never lost {{anything}} before. I said nothing at first, because a big house offers so many chances of things being mislaid, and coming to hand later. [...] "Fetching up in the lee-scuppers," [...] my uncle calls it. But next week I spoke to old Cissie about it when she was doing my hair at night, and she said I wasn't to worry my heart for trifles!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, major, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> {{with myself}} that I {{had not been}} taken prisoner, too. I {{should have been more}} troubled still if Captain Lindsay had not said that, in the first place, Tartar would have been lost if I had not come back {{straight}} to fetch him; and that, in the second place, it was not likely you {{would have been able to}} keep me with you had I been a prisoner, and we might not even have been shut up in the same fortress.|$|E
6000|$|... "Extraordinary! I {{should think}} so. Extraordinary hard lines on me. And she wouldn't let me eat either. She {{followed}} {{me to the}} kitchen in a fury while I cooked for myself. Why imagine! I prepared a dish of champignons: oh, most beautiful champignons, beautiful--and I {{put them on the}} stove to fry in butter: beautiful young champignons. I'm hanged if she didn't go into the kitchen while my back was turned, and pour a pint of old carrot-water into the pan. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>furious.</b> Imagine!--beautiful fresh young champignons--" ...|$|E
60|$|Next day {{the same}} thing happened, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so <b>furious</b> that <b>I</b> bit through my cigarette. Thursday came, when I prayed {{that there might be}} an end of this annoyance, but no, neither of them {{appeared}} on that acquainted ground. Had they changed their post-office? No, for her eyes were red every day, and heavy was her foolish little heart. Love had put out his lights, and the little nursery governess walked in darkness.|$|R
5000|$|Elizabeth <b>I</b> of England <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> {{that two}} noble houses had fought a private battle, defying the {{authority}} she claimed over the Kingdom of Ireland. The {{fact that both}} sides had displayed their banners in the battle was a particular affront to her - it was a symbolic rejection of the monopoly of the crown on making war.|$|R
6000|$|... "On your hind legs!" [...] squealed Billy. They both reared up {{facing each}} other, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> expecting a <b>furious</b> fight, when a gurgly, rumbly voice, called {{out of the}} {{darkness}} to the right--"Children, what are you fighting about there? Be quiet." ...|$|R
