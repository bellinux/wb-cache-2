A study was conducted to evaluate maize accessions for grain and fodder quality traits. Results indicated that higher heritability was found for nutrient detergent fiber, <b>fodder</b> <b>cellulose,</b> fodder crude fiber, fodder crude and fodder moisture percentage while genetic advance was higher for <b>fodder</b> <b>cellulose,</b> fodder crude protein and fodder ash percentage. High significant genotypic and phenotypic correlation was found among grain protein, oil and starch percentage, nutrient detergent fiber, <b>fodder</b> <b>cellulose,</b> fodder crude fiber & protein and fodder moisture percentage. The higher cumulative additive effect was recorded for acid detergent fiber, fodder crude fiber; nutrient detergent fiber and <b>fodder</b> <b>cellulose</b> suggested that selections may be made to develop synthetic varieties for better quality. Higher dominance effect and degree of dominance indicated that selection may be useful for the development of good quality maize hybrids through heterosis breeding programme. Principle component bi-plot analysis indicated that B- 11 ×EV- 347, B- 11, Sh- 139, EV- 1097 ×E- 322, Sh- 139 ×B- 316, B- 327 ×E- 322, B- 316, Raka-poshi, B- 11 ×Pop/ 209, B- 336 ×EV- 340, B- 327 ×E- 322, B- 327 ×F- 96, EV- 1097 ×E- 322, Raka-poshi×EV- 347, EV- 1097 ×Pop/ 209 and EV- 1097 ×EV- 340 performed better for grain and fodder quality and may b...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} the {{experimental}} area of the Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad Pakistan to evaluate the maize accessions for grain and fodder yield. Eighty maize accessions were collected from the Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, University of Agriculture Faisalabad, National Agriculture Research Centre, Islamabad and Maize and Millet Research Institute Sahiwal, Pakistan. Out of these 80 accessions twelve lines were {{selected on the basis of}} batter performance, heritability, genetic advance and higher genotypic correlation among cob length, cob diameter, grain rows per cob, 100 -seed weight, grain yield per plant, green fodder yield, photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll contents, photosynthetic water use efficiency and leaf temperature at maturity stage from experiment 1. The selected parents were crossed following 6 Ã— 6 North Carolina mating design II. The germplasm consisting of 12 parents and 36 crosses was evaluated in field experiment for grain, fodder yield, and then quality traits at maturity stage. It was concluded from present study that genotypes may be selected on the basis of their better performance of cob length, cob diameter, grain rows per cob, 100 -seed weight, grain yield per plant, green fodder yield, photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll contents, photosynthetic water use efficiency and leaf temperature at maturity for grain and green fodder yield while <b>fodder</b> <b>cellulose</b> percentage, fodder crude protein percentage, ash percentage, grain oil percentage, embryo percentage, neutral detergent fibre percentage and fodder moisture percentage as quality for improvement of grain, fodder yield and quality. Higher male additive variance, female additive variance, male Ã— female interaction were found for plant height, stem weight, green fodder yield, leaf weight, leaf length, leaf area, chlorophyll contents, sub-stomata CO 2 concentration, transpiration rate, cob weight, stover weight, grain yield per plant, fodder crude fibre percentage, fodder crude protein percentage, nitrogen free extract percentage, acid detergent fibre percentage, neutral detergent fibre percentage and <b>fodder</b> <b>cellulose</b> percentage. Higher dominance effects and degree of dominance was found for leaf area, leaf temperature, leaf length, stem weight, green fodder yield, chlorophyll contents, sub-stomata CO 2 concentration, photosynthetic rate, cob weight, 100 -seed weight, grain yield per plant, fodder nitrogen free extract percentage, fodder crude fibre and protein percentage, fodder ash percentage and <b>fodder</b> <b>cellulose</b> percentage. The inbred lines B- 316, B- 11, EV- 340, Pop/ 209, B- 336 and EV- 1097 showed higher GCA for most of grain, fodder and quality traits which indicated that these lines may be used for the development of synthetic varieties. The F 1 hybrids B- 11 Ã—E- 322, EV- 1097 Ã—Pop/ 209, B- 327 Ã—F- 96, B- 336 Ã—B- 316, EV- 1097 Ã—E- 322, B- 327 Ã—E- 340, Sh- 139 Ã—Pop/ 209, EV- 1097 Ã—EV- 340, EV- 1097 Ã—B- 316, Raka-poshiÃ—Pop/ 209, B- 336 Ã—EV- 347, B- 336 Ã—Pop/ 209, EV- 1097 Ã—Pop/ 209, B- 316 Ã—E- 340, Raka-poshiÃ—F- 96, B- 327 Ã—Pop/ 209 showed higher SCA for most of grain, fodder and quality traits which indicated that these lines may be used in future for the development of hybrids and heterosis breeding programe...|$|E
