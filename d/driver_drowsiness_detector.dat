40|$|This study {{presents}} a new method to track driver’s facial states, such as head pose and eye-blinking in the real-time basis. Since a {{driver in the}} natural driving condition moves his head in diverse ways and his face is often occluded by his hand or the wheel, {{it should be a}} great challenge for the standard face models. Among many, Active Appearance Model (AAM), and Active Shape Model (ASM) are two favored face models. We have extended Discriminative Bayesian ASM by incorporating the extreme pose cases, called it Pose Extended—Active Shape model (PE-ASM). Two face databases (DB) are used for the comparison purpose: one is the Boston University face DB and the other is our custom-made driving DB. Our evaluation indicates that PE-ASM outperforms ASM and AAM in terms of the face fitting against extreme poses. Using this model, we can estimate the driver’s head pose, as well as eye-blinking, by adding respective processes. Two HMMs are trained to model temporal behaviors of these two facial features, and consequently the system can make inference by enumerating these HMM states whether the driver is drowsy or not. Result suggests that it {{can be used as a}} <b>driver</b> <b>drowsiness</b> <b>detector</b> in the commercial car where the visual conditions are very diverse and often tough to deal with...|$|E
40|$|Currently, <b>driver</b> <b>drowsiness</b> <b>detectors</b> using video based {{technology}} is being widely studied. Eyelid closure degree (ECD) {{is the main}} measure of the video-based methods, however, drawbacks such as brightness limitations and practical hurdles such as distraction of the drivers limits its success. This study presents a way to compute the ECD using EEG sensors instead of video-based methods. The premise is that the ECD exhibits a linear relationship with changes of the occipital EEG. A total of 30 subjects are included in this study: ten of them participated in a simple proof-of-concept experiment to verify the linear relationship between ECD and EEG, and then twenty participated in a monotonous highway driving experiment in a driving simulator environment to test the robustness of the linear relationship in real-life applications. Taking the video-based method as a reference, the Alpha power percentage from the O 2 channel {{is found to be}} the best input feature for linear regression estimation of the ECD. The best overall squared correlation coefficient (SCC, denoted by r 2) and mean squared error (MSE) validated by linear support vector regression model and leave one subject out method is r 2 = 0. 930 and MSE = 0. 013. The proposed linear EEG-ECD model can achieve 87. 5 % and 70. 0 % accuracy for male and female subjects, respectively, for a <b>driver</b> <b>drowsiness</b> application, percentage eyelid closure over the pupil over time (PERCLOS). This new ECD estimation method not only addresses the video-based method drawbacks, but also makes ECD estimation more computationally efficient and easier to implement in EEG sensors in a real time way...|$|R
