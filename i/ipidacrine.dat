50|$|<b>Ipidacrine</b> (Neiromidin) {{is a drug}} first {{synthesized}} by the National Research Center for Biologically Active Compounds in the Russian Federation. This compound is {{a derivative}} of 4-aminopyridine and is structurally similar to tacrine.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ipidacrine</b> {{hydrochloride}} is pharmaceutically active {{compound that}} forms variety of crystalline modifications which differs by solvent type and content in crystalline structure. These crystalline forms analyzed by powder x-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis, thermogravimetry and Karl Fisher titration. Obtained crystalline forms include two monohydrates, two hemihydrates, two anhydrous forms, two non-stoichiometric hydrates and mixed solvates with octanol {{and water and}} methanol and water, solvate with chloroform and dimethylformamide...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} cholinergic drugs {{in the treatment of}} neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD) by a systematic review of the literature on the following agents: choline, lecithin, physostigmine, tacrine, 7 -methoxyacridine, <b>ipidacrine,</b> galantamine, donepezil, rivastigmine, eptastigmine, metrifonate, arecoline, RS 86, xanomeline, cevimeline, deanol, and meclofenoxate. All relevant randomized controlled trials, without any language or year limitations, were obtained from the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group 2 Ì† 7 s Register of Trials. Trials were classified according to their methodological quality. For binary and continuous data, relative risks (RR) and weighted or standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated, respectively. Eleven trials with a total of 261 randomized patients were included in the meta-analysis. Cholinergic drugs showed a minor trend for improvement of tardive dyskinesia symptoms, but results were not statistically significant (RR 0. 84, 95...|$|E
