2500|$|The TOCSY {{experiment}} {{is similar to}} the COSY experiment, in that cross peaks of coupled protons are observed. [...] However, cross peaks are observed not only for nuclei which are directly coupled, but also between nuclei which are connected by a chain of couplings. [...] This makes it useful for identifying the larger <b>interconnected</b> <b>networks</b> of spin couplings. [...] This ability is achieved by inserting a repetitive series of pulses which cause isotropic mixing during the mixing period. [...] Longer isotropic mixing times cause the polarization to spread out through an increasing number of bonds.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{international}} collaborations on the ARPANET were rare. European developers {{were concerned}} with developing the X.25 networks. Notable exceptions were the Norwegian Seismic Array (NORSAR) in June 1973, followed in 1973 by Sweden with satellite links to the Tanum Earth Station and Peter T. Kirstein's research group in the United Kingdom, initially at the Institute of Computer Science, University of London and later at University College London. In December 1974, RFC 675 (Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program), by Vinton Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine, used the term internet as a shorthand for internetworking and later RFCs repeated this use. [...] Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 when the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the Computer Science Network (CSNET). [...] In 1982, the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) was standardized, which permitted worldwide proliferation of <b>interconnected</b> <b>networks.</b>|$|E

This data illustrates {{the difficulty of}} obtaining high-quality signal, power, clock and thermal <b>interconnect</b> <b>networks</b> for gigascale 2 D and 3 D integrated circuits. Specific material, process, circuit, packaging, and architecture solutions to enhance these four types of <b>interconnect</b> <b>networks</b> are proposed and quantitatively evaluated. A microchannel-cooled 3 D integrated circuit technology is developed to deal with thermal interconnect problems inherent to stacked dice. The benefits of carbon nanotube technology, improved repeater insertion techniques and parallel processing architectures for signal <b>interconnect</b> <b>networks</b> are evaluated. A circuit technique to periodically reverse current direction in power <b>interconnect</b> <b>networks</b> is proposed. It provides several orders of magnitude improvement in electromigration lifetimes. Methods to control power supply noise and reduce its impact on clock <b>interconnect</b> <b>networks</b> are investigated.

40|$|Nowadays, every {{electronic}} system, {{ranging from}} a small mobile phone to a satellite sent into space, has a System-on-Chip (SoC). SoCs have undergone rapid evolution and are still progressing at a swift pace. Due to explosive evolution of semiconductor industry, the devices are scaling down at a rapid rate and hence, the SoCs today have become communication-centric and shared bus system and crossbar system were fail to performed communication in side SoC. Interconnection networks offer an alternate solution to this communication paradigm and are becoming persistent in SoC. A NoC based <b>interconnect</b> <b>network</b> is a well-organized and efficiently use of limited communication channel while maintaining low packet latency, high saturation throughput, high communication bandwidth amongst different IPs core with a minimum area and low power-dissipation. In this thesis we present details performance analysis of four <b>interconnect</b> <b>network</b> mesh, torus, fat tree and butterfly in term of latency and throughput under uniform, tornado, neighbour, bit reversal and bit complement traffic using cycle accurate simulator. We also implement NoC <b>interconnect</b> <b>networks</b> on FPGA and see the effect of NoC parameters(FDW,FBD,VC) on FPGA, and validate their performance through FPGA synthesis. We found that the FDW and buffer depth have the great effect on FPGA resources, Virtual Channels (VCs) with all NoC parameter have considerably effect on buffer size and routing and logic requirements at NoC. We also analysis all <b>interconnect</b> <b>networks</b> in term of power and area at 65 nm technology by using synopsis tool.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the dynamical behaviors of epidemic spreading over a two-layered <b>interconnected</b> <b>network.</b> Three models in different levels are proposed to describe cooperative spreading processes over the <b>interconnected</b> <b>network,</b> wherein the disease in one network can spread to the other. Theoretical analysis is provided for each model to reveal that the global epidemic threshold in the <b>interconnected</b> <b>network</b> is not larger than the epidemic thresholds for the two isolated layered networks. In particular, in an <b>interconnected</b> homogenous <b>network,</b> detailed theoretical analysis is presented, which allows quick and accurate calculations of the global epidemic threshold. Moreover, in an <b>interconnected</b> heterogeneous <b>network</b> with inter-layer correlation between node degrees, it is found that the inter-layer correlation coefficient has little impact on the epidemic threshold, but has significant impact on the total prevalence. Simulations further verify the analytical results, showing that cooperative epidemic processes promote the spreading of diseases. Comment: 12 pages, 15 figure...|$|R
