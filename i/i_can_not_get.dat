60|$|The {{following}} is an argument of Descartes to prove, in his a priori manner, the being of a God. The conception, says he, of an infinite Being proves the real existence of such a being. For {{if there is not}} really any such being, I must have made the conception; but if I could make it, I can also unmake it; which evidently is not true; therefore there must be, externally to myself, an archetype, from which the conception was derived. In this argument (which, it may be observed, would equally prove the real existence of ghosts and of witches) the ambiguity is in the pronoun I, by which, in one place, is to be understood my will, in another the laws of my nature. If the conception, existing as it does in my mind, had no original without, the conclusion would unquestionably follow that I made it; that is, the laws of my nature must have somehow evolved it: but that my will made it, would not follow. Now when Descartes afterward adds that I can not unmake the conception, he means that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> rid of it by an act of my will: which is true, but is not the proposition required. I can as much unmake this conception as I can any other: no conception which I have once had, can I ever dismiss by mere volition; but what some of the laws of my nature have produced, other laws, or those same laws in other circumstances, may, and often do, subsequently efface.|$|E

5000|$|He was a {{practicing}} Catholic, and well respected by other members, a fact {{reflected on the}} final day of his term, December 19, 1974: [...] "In conclusion, and precisely because I did not let my spiritual beliefs at the door, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> rid of the solidarity that binds me to the society in which I live.
