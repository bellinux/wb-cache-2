25|$|During her imprisonment, Maria Luisa and her {{children}} were stripped of their rights to the Spanish crown by the Cádiz Cortes, on 18 March 1812, because she was under Napoleon's control. Her rights were not restored until 1820. The former Queen of Etruria wrote in her Memoirs:I was {{for two years and}} a half in that monastery and one year without seeing or talking to anybody. I was not allowed to write or receive news not even from my own son. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the convent for eleven months already when my parents came with my son to Rome on 16 June 1812. I was hoping to be released immediately after their arrival, but I was wrong, instead of diminishing the rigor of my imprisonment I was put under stricter orders.|$|E

And this record is my payment. This is me giving back what I was given, or took. [...] If you believe in some mythology, and you want to live by those rules, then I had to say myself: 'I'm not really doing what I set out to do,' even though I tried to convince myself that I was. I'm not regretting the last few records that I've made, but since Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death), I've not made something with [...] sheer utter fearlessness and anger and force.|$|E

500|$|While {{performing}} at the 1998 KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California, Third Eye Blind bassist Arion Salazar ran onstage and [...] "bear-hugged" [...] Dirnt, who was caught off-guard. [...] The incident escalated into an on-stage scuffle before Salazar {{was taken away}} by security. [...] After the performance, Dirnt confronted Salazar backstage, and as the two were arguing, a beer bottle struck Dirnt in the head, causing a small fracture in his skull. [...] Eyewitnesses later attributed the bottle throwing to a fan of Third Eye Blind. [...] Salazar and the band's management soon released a statement: [...] "I am sorry that my attempt at doing something I thought would be funny escalated into Mike getting hurt. That was never my intention. I simply {{had too much to}} drink and made a very bad decision. [...] If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> Mike's place, I am sure I would have acted similarly.

Have patience and stick with the Birds and root for the Birds." [...] After the Orioles lost six consecutive games {{to begin the}} 1988 season, Ripken was fired. Several years later, he said, [...] "It {{was very difficult to}} accept. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the organization. I had worked my way up to the big leagues. I spent my life with the Orioles." [...] The move [...] "hurt" [...] and [...] "bothered" [...] Cal Jr., but he worked through it and remained with the team for 13 more seasons, the rest of his career. Billy switched his number from 3 to 7, saying, [...] "I just didn't want to see anybody else wear it." [...] After Hall of Famer Frank Robinson replaced Ripken, the Orioles proceeded to lose 15 more consecutive games to set the record for the longest losing streak to start a season. He finished his managerial record with a record of 68 wins and 101 losses.|$|E

2500|$|Smith, who had {{previously}} worked with Disney on films such as No Deposit, No Return and Herbie Goes Bananas, devoted almost three years to Never Cry Wolf. Smith wrote, [...] "I was much more closely involved in that picture than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> any other film. Not only acting, but writing and the whole creative process." [...] He also found the process difficult. [...] "During much of the two-year shooting schedule in Canada's Yukon and in Nome, Alaska, I was the only actor present. It was the loneliest film I've ever worked on," [...] Smith said.|$|E
2500|$|Shore {{spent her}} last years in poverty. She {{had to sell}} her Weston {{photographs}} to survive and became increasingly depressed. Sometime in the late 1950s her neighbors had her institutionalized. Her very dear friend Jehanne Bietry Salinger said about the matter, [...] "some so-called 'do-gooders' went to her studio, found it disorganized, and had Henrietta committed to an asylum. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> Carmel, I would never have permitted it, since she {{was in no way}} insane. I still can not think about this without being heartbroken."

[...] It seemed a long time ago. [...] Looking back on the few but crowded years between, it occurred to me forcibly how fortunate <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> my decision and how lucky not to miss the experiences which had fallen to my lot in the intervening space of time. To me, it was not disagreeable to look forward to a future of uncertainty and insecurity, with none of the slow inevitability of a career in the Government service; to feel myself, in however small a way, the master of my destiny. With my left foot I turned the hot-water tap full on and wallowed contentedly.|$|E
2500|$|Porter {{began his}} {{engineering}} career in 1954 at WLAC-TV in Nashville, Tennessee, where {{he wished to}} be a cameraman—nobody wanted to mix sound, though, and that job was assigned to him, {{the guy with the}} least seniority. He mixed up to four microphones for television broadcast for $92 per week, equivalent to $ today. At nearby RCA Records in 1959, the chief engineer was transferred after angering Chet Atkins, and Porter applied for the position. He was told by an RCA executive from New York that the job would ruin his marriage, but Porter said [...] "I can handle that"—he was hired at $148 per week, and given two weeks to learn all the equipment and how to mix up to 12 microphones for music recordings. Shortly after starting with RCA on March 31, 1959, Porter mixed the single [...] "Lonesome Old House" [...] for Don Gibson; it was a crossover success in both the country music and the pop music charts, and Porter began to be requested by name. In June 1959, he mixed [...] "The Three Bells" [...] for the Browns, with Atkins producing and Anita Kerr arranging. While editing the master to be sent to New York for pressing, Porter accidentally hit the wrong controls on the tape recorder and stretched the tape {{at the beginning of the}} song, distorting the pitch. Without telling anyone, he spliced a different take with a good intro onto the beginning, and sent that version instead. Four decades later, Porter recalled his quick fix: [...] "this was a need-to-know situation and I figured nobody needed to know. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the business three months or something like that. You're not a good engineer until you destroy a master and hopefully live to talk about it." [...] In July, the song went to number one on the U.S. country and pop charts, and Porter's reputation rose.|$|E
