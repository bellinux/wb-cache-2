30|$|Electrical {{impedance}} tomography (EIT) detects {{areas of}} reduced lung aeration by measuring a parallel reduction in electrical resistance, which {{reflects the fact}} that electrically conducting structures are less stretched and more densely arranged [5, 6]. The level of end-expiratory lung impedance (EELI) was shown to correlate with the <b>intrathoracic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> at this time point, i.e., the end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) [7]. Impedance changes between inspiration and expiration (tidal variation) are a measure of global and regional tidal volumes [8]. EIT is therefore used in real-time imaging of impaired aeration in diseased lungs of, e.g., patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [9, 10], helps in prompt evaluation of therapeutic interventions such as recruitment maneuvers [11, 12] and PEEP titration [13] and may give additional information for decision-making when considering extracorporeal circulation [14].|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} how epidural anesthesia changes <b>intrathoracic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>volume,</b> high epidural anesthesia {{was administered to}} five pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs lying supine, and the total intrathoracic volume at end-expiration was measured with a high-speed three-dimensional x-ray scanner. The amount of gas in the lungs at end-expiration [the functional residual capacity (FRC) ] was measured with a nitrogen washout technique, and the intrathoracic tissue volume, including the intrathoracic blood volume, was calculated as the difference between intrathoracic volume at end-expiration and FRC. High epidural anesthesia with the local anesthetic etidocaine to a T- 1 myotomal level significantly (P < 0. 05) increased intrathoracic volume at end-expiration [76 +/- 35 mL (M +/- SD) ] by significantly increasing both intrathoracic tissue volume (33 +/- 15 mL) and FRC (43 +/- 26 mL). Increases in intrathoracic tissue volume were probably caused by increases in intrathoracic blood volume. We conclude that increases in FRC caused by epidural anesthesia in anesthetized dogs lying supine may be minimized by a concurrent increase in intrathoracic blood volume. These results suggest that measurements of thoracic gas volume alone may be insufficient to describe chest wall responses to epidural anesthesia. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Although hyperlipidemia {{is common}} in COPD, its {{relationship}} to comorbidities, risk factors and lung function in COPD has not been studied in detail. Using the baseline data of the COSYCONET cohort we addressed this question. Data from 1746 COPD patients (GOLD stage 1 - 4; mean age 64. 6 y, mean FEV 1 %pred 57 %) were evaluated, focusing on the comorbidities hyperlipidemia, diabetes and cardiovascular complex (CVC; including arterial hypertension, cardiac failure, ischemic heart disease). Risk factors comprised age, gender, BMI, and packyears of smoking. The results of linear and logistic regression analyses were implemented into a path analysis model describing the multiple relationships between parameters. Hyperlipidemia (prevalence 42. 9 %) was associated with lower <b>intrathoracic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> (ITGV) and higher forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) when adjusting for its multiple relationships to risk factors and other comorbidities. These findings were robust in various statistical analyses. The associations between comorbidities and risk factors {{were in accordance with}} previous findings, thereby underlining the validity of our data. In conclusion, hyperlipidemia was associated with less hyperinflation and airway obstruction in patients with COPD. This surprising result might be due to different COPD phenotypes in these patients or related to effects of medication...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] To date {{there are}} no data {{on the effects of}} lung {{transplantation}} on diaphragmatic function in patients with end stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is not known whether the relation between the transdiaphragmatic pressure (PDI) and lung volume is altered in recipients after transplantation as a result of changes in diaphragmatic structure caused by chronic hyperinflation. The effect of lung transplantation on diaphragmatic strength was determined in patients with COPD and the relation between postoperative PDI and lung volume analysed. METHODS [...] Diaphragmatic strength was assessed in eight double lung transplant recipients, six single lung transplant recipients, and in 14 patients with COPD whose lung function was {{similar to those of the}} transplant recipients preoperatively. PDI obtained during unilateral and bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation at 1 Hz (twitch PDI) at functional residual capacity (FRC) and during maximal sniff manoeuvres (sniff PDI) at various levels of inspiratory vital capacity (VCin) served as parameters for diaphragmatic strength. Sniff PDI assessed at the various VCin levels were used to analyse the PDI/lung volume relation. RESULTS [...] Lung transplantation caused a reduction in lung volume, especially in the double lung transplant recipients. As a consequence sniff PDI was higher in the double lung transplant recipients than in the patients with COPD at all levels of VCin analysed. However, sniff PDI values analysed at comparable <b>intrathoracic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>volumes</b> were not reduced in the patients with COPD when compared with those who underwent lung transplantation. Bilateral twitch PDI values were similar in the patients with COPD and in the lung transplant recipients. In the single lung transplant recipients unilateral twitch PDI values were similar on the transplanted and the non-transplanted side. The relation between PDI and lung volume was similar in the patients with COPD and in the lung transplant recipients. CONCLUSIONS [...] In patients with COPD lung transplantation leads to an increase the maximal sniff induced PDI values by placing the diaphragm in a more favourable position for pressure generation. Since patients with COPD and postoperative lung transplant recipients showed similar PDI/lung volume relations, this suggests that chronic pulmonary hyperinflation does not cause major functional alterations of the diaphragm...|$|R

They were old (mean = 66 +/- 8 years), with severe airflow limitation (FEV 1 = 30 +/- 12 percent of predicted), some CO 2 retention (PaCO 2 = 47 +/- 9 mm Hg), and compensated respiratory acidosis. Eighteen {{percent of the patients}} presented some complicating pleuropulmonary diseases (pleural thickening, sequelae of tuberculosis, etc). Overall survival proportion was poor: 70, 50, and 43 percent at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. The Cox model showed that the factors which independently reduced survival were lower CO transfer coefficient, smaller <b>intrathoracic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>volume,</b> more severe bronchial obstruction, the fact that oxygen administration did not increase PaO 2 above 65 mm Hg, increasing age, and the presence of chest wall abnormalities. When the patients were divided into three groups according to mortality risk, the mean clinical and functional profile of the high-mortality risk group was consistent with the prevalence of emphysematous lesions. Moreover, the best survivors fitted better into the "bronchitic" type; they showed a higher mean PaCO 2, suggesting that some degree of hypoventilation could delay muscular fatigue and improve survival. The difference in the proportion of "emphysematous" and "bronchitic" patients is a possible explanation for the variability of the mortality rate reported in literature...|$|E
40|$|Estimating {{the degree}} of {{pulmonary}} hyperinflation in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) is not always straight forward. Standard pulmonary function tests provide only a crude estimate of this important aspect of COPD. In addition, good patient cooperation cannot always be achieved and therefore adds to the uncertainties with regard to the extent of hyperinflation of the lung. The aim of this investigation was to characterize exhaled breath condensate nitrite in volunteers, healthy smokers, and stable COPD (GOLD-stages 0 - 4) and to compare this parameter with inflammatory markers in exhaled breath condensate and with lung function in order to test the hypothesis that elevated exhaled breath condensate nitrite reflects hyperinflation in COPD. We found a logarithmic correlation of exhaled breath condensate nitrite to residual volume (r= 0. 75, p< 0. 0001), total lung capacity (r= 0. 51, p< 0. 0001), and thoracic gas volume (r= 0. 71, p< 0. 0001) but no correlation of exhaled breath condensate nitrite concentrations with levels of inflammatory cytokines in exhaled breath condensate (interleukin (IL) - 8, IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, IL- 10, IL- 12, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha). Analysis of COPD subgroups revealed a logarithmic correlation of EBC nitrite to residual volume, total lung capacity, and <b>intrathoracic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> exclusively for patients characterized by GOLD classes 2, and higher. Our results confirm a relation of exhaled breath condensate nitrite levels and hyperinflation measured by conventional pulmonary function tests.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{evaluated}} the feasibility and short-term functional outcome after bronchoscopic lung-volume reduction performed with one-way valves {{in patients with}} severe heterogeneous emphysema. METHODS: Thirteen patients entered this pilot study. Endobronchial one-way valves {{were placed in the}} segmental bronchi supplying the most hyperinflated parts of the emphysematous lungs to allow lung deflation, reduce lung volume, and alleviate symptoms. The valves and delivery catheter were inserted under intravenous anesthesia and spontaneous assisted ventilation, with visual control through a flexible bronchoscope. We performed unilateral bronchoscopic lung-volume reduction in 11 patients and staged bilateral procedures in 2. Preoperative median forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) was 0. 75 L/s (22 %), residual volume was 5. 3 L (233 %), total lung capacity, 7. 9 L (123 %); <b>intrathoracic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>volume,</b> 6. 5 L (176 %); and 6 -minute walk test, 223 meters. All patients required supplemental oxygen at rest (1. 4 L/min). The median preoperative Medical Research Council (MRC) scale dyspnea score was 4. RESULTS: Six complications occurred in 3 patients: two bilateral and one contralateral pneumothorax, one pneumonia, and two episodes of bronchospasm. Functional results at 1 and 3 months showed a significant improvement in FEV 1, residual volume, and 6 -minute walk test; 43 % of the patients were able to completely stop supplemental oxygen. The posttreatment MRC median dyspnea score at 1 and 3 months was 2. Bronchoscopic follow up at 1 and 3 months showed that the valves were correctly in place with no granulation. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchoscopic lung-volume reduction with one-way valves can be performed with acceptable short-term safety and worthwhile functional benefits...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the clinical benefit of exercise in these patients. Twenty-nine inpatients were randomly assigned to a training group (n= 15, FEV 1 34 % pred) or a control group (n= 14, FEV 1 38 % pred). On ten consecutive days, patients in the training group performed a 6 -min treadmill walking test and, in addition, five walking sessions per day at ≥ 75 % of the respective treadmill walking distance. Patients in the control group performed only treadmill walking tests on days 1, 5, and 10. To directly compare the possible benefit of exercise training all patients had an exercise test on day 11 at the same work load as on day 1. In the training group, 6 -min walking distance increased from 237 to 420 m, in the control group from 230 to 255 m over the 10 day period which was significantly different (P< 0 · 0001). Minute ventilation and oxygen uptake increased significantly (P< 0 · 05) in the training but not in the control group. When comparing exercise tests on days 1 and 11, minute ventilation, oxygen uptake, PaCO 2, lactic acid concentration, and Borg scale were significantly reduced to achieve the same work load (P< 0 · 01) only in the training group. <b>Intrathoracic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> and residual volume decreased, and FEV 1 and vital capacity increased in the training (P< 0 · 05) but not in the control group.

Treatment guidelines recommend therapy with bronchodilators as first choice. We investigated the acute effect of single-dose indacaterol on lung hyperinflation in COPD subjects, for the first time evaluating the potential effects on right heart performance. Methods: In this Phase IV, randomized, interventional, double-blind, crossover clinical study, we recruited 40 patients (50 – 85 years of age) with stable COPD. Patients were treated with 150 µg indacaterol or placebo and after 60 minutes (T 60) and 180 minutes (T 180) the following tests were performed: trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE), plethysmography, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, saturation of peripheral oxygen, and visual analog scale dyspnea score. Patients underwent a crossover re-challenge after a further 72 hours of pharmacological washout. All TTE measurements were conducted blindly by the same operator and further interpreted by two different blinded operators. Consensus decisions were taken on every value and parameter. The primary outcome was the effect of the reduction of residual volume and functional residual capacity on right heart systolic and diastolic function indexes evaluated by TTE in patients treated with indacaterol, as compared to placebo. Results: Vital capacity, inspiratory capacity, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second were significantly increased by indacaterol, when compared with placebo, while residual volume, <b>intrathoracic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>volume,</b> and specific airway resistance were significantly reduced in patients treated with indacaterol. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion was significantly increased versus placebo, paralleled by an increase of tricuspid E-wave deceleration time. The cardiac frequency was also significantly reduced in indacaterol-treated patients. Conclusion: Indacaterol significantly reduces lung hyperinflation in acute conditions, with a clinically relevant improvement of dyspnea. These modifications are associated with a significant increase of the right ventricular compliance indexes and may have a role in improving left ventricular preload leading to a reduction in cardiac frequency.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundTiotropium {{is a new}} long-acting {{anticholinergic}} bronchodilator, {{which is}} recommended as first-line therapy {{in the management of}} chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is currently available {{in the form of a}} dry powder inhaler worldwide. Some COPD patients find it difficult to generate inspiratory flow rates of up to 40 l/min, which is required for the drug to reach the airways. To overcome this, a new pMDI form has been developed for administration of tiotropium in patients with COPD. The clinical efficacy of this mode of tiotropium delivery has, so far, not been compared with the currently available dry powder inhaler (DPI) devices. Aims and objectivesTo compare the bronchodilator effects of a single dose of 18 mcg of tiotropium administered via a pressurized meter dose inhaler (pMDI) and spacer with the currently available DPI form through Rotahaler®. Study designA randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, three-period, placebo-controlled, crossover, single-center study was conducted in 19 patients with stable COPD. Single doses of tiotropium (18 mcg) or placebo were administered on three separate study days (4 – 7 days apart) through a Rotahaler® and pMDI with a non-static spacer (Zerostat, Cipla Ltd.). During each study visit forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured over a period of 24 h at 11 different time points (0, 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h), using a bellows spirometer (Vitalograph® 2160, UK) while static parameters like inspiratory capacity (IC), residual volume (RV), <b>intrathoracic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> (ITGV) and total lung capacity (TLC) were measured by bodyplethysmography (Jaeger Masterscreen, Germany) at 0 min, 3, 8 and 24 h. ResultsTiotropium administered through both pMDI (and spacer) and DPI showed significantly better mean FEV 1 and mean FVC differences from baseline, in terms of mean maximum change and area under curve over a period of 24 h (AUC 0 – 24 h), as compared to placebo. The mean IC and trough FEV 1 values also improved significantly with tiotropium administered through both the devices as compared to placebo. For all these parameters, there was no difference in the efficacy between pMDI and DPI. There was also no significant difference between the time to onset, time to maximum response and duration of response between tiotropium administered through both the study devices. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in RV, ITGV and TLC by a single dose of tiotopium delivered through either of the devices when compared with placebo over a period of 24 h. ConclusionThis is the first study to demonstrate that tiotropium administered by pMDI and spacer shows a superior time-dependent bronchodilator response when compared to placebo, and that this therapeutic efficacy is similar to tiotropium administered by DPI. We recommend the use of tiotropium administered through a pMDI and spacer to those COPD patients who prefer to use the pMDI device, and especially in those who cannot generate sufficient inspiratory flows required for dry powder inhaler devices...|$|E

40|$|In October 2005 the {{monoclonal}} anti-IgE antibody Omalizumab {{was approved}} {{as a new}} treatment option to manage severe allergic asthma in patient from age 12 and integrated into the WHO recommended treatment guidelines. This new causal way of treatment, in combinition with immunomodulating effects, {{reduced the number of}} asthma exacerbations and hospitalization and therefore lead to an improved quality of life for many patients. Plenty of studies document the safety and efficacy of the drug, however there are neither predictors indicating which patient could benefit most from the drug, nor any parameters to monitor an ongoing therapy. In the light of cost-benefit-analysis both would be highly desirable. Objective {{of this study was to}} identify predictors that are simple to measure and easy to control in order to monitor a positive therapeutic response to a treatment with Omalizumab. Ideally those predictors could be used to monitor an ongoing therapy as well. Data of 44 patients with severe allergic asthma were analyzed retrospectively. They had received Omalizumab every second to fourth week over 16 weeks in a dose of 0, 016 mg/kg/IgE [IU/ml]. Using a five point chart, these patients were divided into responders and non responders. Before and 16 weeks after initiation of therapy various clinical parameters as well as the patients lung function (as results of body plethymography) were compared and statistically analyzed together with the demographic data. Furthermore the results of spiroergometry of two groups of 10 patients each with severe allergic asthma, receiving Omalizumab or placebo respectively, were analyzed retrospectively. Respiratory values were compared in order to find reliable parameters to monitor the therapy. Younger patients were more responsive to the therapy, as well as patients with lower absolute specific IgE against the allergen with the highest specific IgE-level (seasonal or perennial) before start of the therapy, but with no differences concerning total IgE or the specific IgE of the perrenial allergen. Response to therapy was associated with significantly decreased eosinophil granulocytes in peripheral blood as well as the value of ECP. Levels of Annexin as indicator of grade of apoptosis increased. The use of inhalative β 2 -sympathomimetics decreased significantly as well. Monitoring immunomodulating effect, a significant decrease of B-lymphoctes in response to therapy was seen. Non responders showed remarkable (but statistically not significant) higher values of IL- 13 before and after the therapy with Omalizumab. Airway resistence had significantly decreased in the group of responders. Furthermore various parameters of spiroergometry such as increased forced expiratory volume in one second, maximal minute ventilation, tidal volume, oxygen uptake and oxygen uptake on anaerobic threshold remarkably show the significant improvement of lung function during the Omalizumab treatment as well as the decrease of <b>intrathoracic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>volume.</b> Based on the results of our analysis, the responsiveness of patients to Omalizumab will be better with lower age and lower specific absolute IgE levels, for both, perenial and concornitant seasonal allergens. Measurement of eosinophiles, ECP and Annexin could be useful for monitoring an ongoing therapy. B-lympozytes and IL- 13 are indicators for the immunmodulatroy response to Omalizumab. Additionally, spirogergometry is an economically reasonable tool for monitoring the therapeutic success of an ongoing therapy by measuring a significantly improved lung function...|$|E

Objective: The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the pulmonary function and the quality of life ofpatients with PIBO and the correlation between both variables. Methods: 14 children with PIBO in follow up at the pediatric pulmonology outpatient clinic of a public children hospital were included in this study. Study period: April 2009 - April 2010. Pulmonary function was assessed in a medical visit by spirometry, flow/volume curve and <b>intrathoracic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> measurement. The following indices were analyzed FVC, FEV 1, FEV 25 - 75, FEV 1 /FVC, RV, TLC, RV and RV/TLC. A survey of a self-administered Quality of Life (PedsQL, version 4. 0, Spanish for Chile) was applied at the visit to investigate their global, physical and psychosocial quality of life. The Pearson linear correlation between quality of life and the pulmonary function test parameters was assessed, in the statistical analysis ap value < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: The mean age of our patients was 12. 4 (range: 9 - 19 years-old). The functional alterations were characteristics of an obstructive respiratory disorder in 64. 3 % of the patients. Average pulmonary function test indices showed decreases in FEV 1 (75 %), FEV 25 - 75 (48. 8 %), FEV 1 /FVC (67. 6 %) with normal value of FVC (93, 7 %) as well as pronounced increases in RV (333. 5 %), TLC (156 %) and RV/TLC (51. 8 %). Mean change of FEV 1 and FEV 25 - 75 post-bronchodilator was 11. 3 % and 26. 4 % respectively. Only 14. 3 % of our patients showed normal pulmonary function. The quality of life parameters were in average 58. 2 % of overall quality of life, 58. 6 % ofphysical quality of life and 57. 9 % ofpsychosocial quality of life.

In the automated test, kinetics of gas production were described by a three phase model: y=a 1 /(1 +(b 1 /t) c 1) +[cdots, three dots, centered]+a 3 /(1 +(b 3 /t) c 3), where y is the <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> at time t and a 1 -a 3 are the <b>volumes</b> of <b>gas</b> in the pools, b 1 -b 3, the time when half of the <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> of a given pool is produced and c 1 -c 3 describe the switching characteristics of the curves by pool. The model fitted gas production profiles, {{but there was no}} relationship between curve parameters and DMI in multiple regressions (R 2 = 0. 24, P= 0. 06). In contrast, combined <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> and substrate degradability measurements at 24 h of incubation accounted for 63, 62 and 56 % of the variation (P< 0. 0001) in DMI when PF was combined with <b>gas</b> <b>volumes</b> measured after 2, 4 and 6 h of incubation, respectively, with PF accounting for 31 % of variation in DMI. Forages with high voluntary DMI have high <b>gas</b> <b>volumes</b> at early incubation times (i. e., 2 - 8 h) and high substrate true degradabilities at 24 h of incubation, but low gas production at later times of incubation...|$|R

Five successive cycles of storage process were successfully operated under this scenario leading target production rate to be realized.

In the next step, to study the contribution of this parameter and perform a sensitivity analysis of the process concerning this parameter, scenario 5.2 was rerun in two stages.

The differential pressure of each stage and change characteristic of <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> fraction under various inlet <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> fraction were compared via steady simulations. The distribution characteristics of pressure and <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> fraction in three stages were studied, and the movement of gas pockets in impellers was discovered via unsteady simulations as well. Four types of flow patterns were observed during the visualization experiments with the increasing inlet <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> fraction.

40|$|The {{assumption}} of equal mixture densities at the inlet and {{the throat of}} the Venturi is only valid in a homogenous flow. This assumption is no longer valid for a separated flow and therefore, the measurement of the <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> fraction at the throat must be introduced. This paper presents an advanced Conductance Multiphase Venturi Meter (CMVM) which is capable of measuring the <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> fraction at the throat of the CMVM. In water continuous multiphase flow, the electrical conductance technique has proven attractive for many industrial applications. In gas-water two phase flow the electric conductance technique {{can be used to}} extract the <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> fraction.

40|$|Separated flow in a Venturi meter {{is highly}} complex and the {{application}} of a homogenous flow model could not reasonably be expected to lead to highly accurate results. If this is the case, a <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> fraction measurement technique at the throat must also be introduced instead of just relying on the <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> fraction measurement at the inlet of the Venturi. This paper presents an advanced Conductance Multiphase Venturi Meter (CMVM) which is capable of measuring the <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> fractions at the inlet and the throat of the Venturi. A new model was investigated to measure the gas flow rate. This model is based on the measurement of the <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> fractions at the inlet and the throat of the Venturi meter using a conductance technique rather than relying on the prior knowledge of the mass flow quality x. We measure conductance using two ring electrodes flush with the inner surface of the Venturi throat and two ring electrodes flush with the inner surface of the Venturi inlet. The basic operation of the electrical conductance technique in a multiphase flow is that the conductance of the mixture depends on the <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> fraction in the water. An electronic circuit was built and calibrated to give a dc voltage output which is proportional to the conductance of the mixture which can then be related to the water film thickness in annular flow (and hence to the <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> fraction). It was inferred from the experimental results that the error of the measured gas flow rates was within ± 1. 9...|$|R
