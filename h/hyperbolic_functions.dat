25|$|A {{hyperbolic}} {{angle is}} an argument of a hyperbolic function just as the circular angle is the argument of a circular function. The comparison can be visualized as {{the size of the}} openings of a hyperbolic sector and a circular sector since the areas of these sectors correspond to the angle magnitudes in each case. Unlike the circular angle, the hyperbolic angle is unbounded. When the circular and <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>functions</b> are viewed as infinite series in their angle argument, the circular ones are just alternating series forms of the <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>functions.</b> This weaving of the two types of angle and function was explained by Leonhard Euler in Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite.|$|E
25|$|Hyperbolas {{share many}} of the ellipses' {{analytical}} properties such as eccentricity, focus, and directrix. Typically the correspondence {{can be made with}} nothing more than a change of sign in some term. Many other mathematical objects have their origin in the hyperbola, such as hyperbolic paraboloids (saddle surfaces), hyperboloids ("wastebaskets"), hyperbolic geometry (Lobachevsky's celebrated non-Euclidean geometry), <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>functions</b> (sinh, cosh, tanh, etc.), and gyrovector spaces (a geometry proposed for use in both relativity and quantum mechanics which is not Euclidean).|$|E
25|$|After many failed {{attempts}} to derive the parallel postulate from other axioms, {{the study of}} the still hypothetical hyperbolic geometry by Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728–1777) led him to introduce the <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>functions</b> and compute the area of a hyperbolic triangle (where the sum of angles is less than 180°). Then the Russian mathematician Nikolai Lobachevsky (1792–1856) established in 1826 (and published in 1829) the coherence of this geometry (thus the independence of the parallel postulate), in parallel with the Hungarian mathematician János Bolyai (1802–1860) in 1832, and with Gauss.|$|E

25|$|By taking limits, certain {{rational}} {{products with}} infinitely many factors can be evaluated {{in terms of}} the gamma function as well. Due to the Weierstrass factorization theorem, analytic functions can be written as infinite products, and these can sometimes be represented as finite products or quotients of the gamma function. We have already seen one striking example: the reflection formula essentially represents the sine function as the product of two gamma functions.
