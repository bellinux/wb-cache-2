[...] It attaches to the subject charged in the varying condition in which it happens to be from time to time. [...] It is the essence of such a charge that it remains dormant until the undertaking ceases to be a going concern, or until the person in whose favour the charge is created intervenes.

[...] An equitable lien is a non-possessory security right conferred by operation of law, which is similar in effect to an <b>equitable</b> <b>charge.</b> [...] It differs from a charge {{in that it is}} non-consensual. [...] It is conferred only in very limited circumstances, the most common (and least ambiguous) of which is in relation to the sale of land; an unpaid vendor has an equitable lien over the land for the purchase price, notwithstanding that the purchaser has gone into occupation of the property. [...] It is seen as a counterweight to the equitable rule which confers a beneficial interest in the land on the purchaser once contracts are exchanged for purchase.|$|E
2500|$|This wide {{discretion}} of the administrator to manage the company is reflected also in paragraph 3(3)-(4), whereby the administrator may choose between which result (whether saving the company, selling the business, or winding down) [...] "he thinks" [...] subjectively is most appropriate. This places an administrator in an analogous position to a company director. Similarly, further binding duties allow a broad scope for the administrator to exercise good business judgment. An administrator is subject to a duty to perform her functions as 'quickly and efficiently as is reasonably practicable', and must also not act so as to 'unfairly harm' a creditor's interests. In Re Charnley Davies Ltd (No 2) the administrator sold the insolvent company's business at an allegedly undervalued price, which creditors alleged breached his duty to not unfairly harm them. Millett J held the standard of care was not breached, and was the same standard of care as in professional negligence cases of an [...] "ordinary, skilled practitioner". He emphasised that courts should not judge decisions which may turn out sub-optimal {{with the benefit of}} hindsight. Here the price was the best possible in the circumstances. Further, in Oldham v Kyrris it was held that creditors may not sue administrators directly in their own capacity, because the duty is owed to the company. So a former employee of a Burger King franchise with an <b>equitable</b> <b>charge</b> for £270,000 for unpaid wages could not sue the administrator directly, outside the terms of the statutory standard, unless responsibility had been directly assumed to him.|$|E

2500|$|While {{all records}} of all a company's {{debentures}} {{need to be}} kept by the company, debentures secured by a [...] "charge" [...] must additionally be registered under the Companies Act 2006 section 860 with Companies House, along with any charge on land, negotiable instruments, uncalled shares, book debts and floating charges, among other things. The purpose of registration is chiefly to publicise which creditors take priority, so that creditors can assess a company's risk profile when making lending decisions. The sanction for failure to register is that the charge becomes void, and unenforceable. This does not extinguish the debt itself, but any advantage from priority is lost and the lender will be an unsecured creditor. In National Provincial Bank v Charnley {{there had been a}} dispute about which creditor should have priority after Mr Charnley's assets had been seized, with the Bank claiming its charge was first and properly registered. Giving judgment for the bank Atkin LJ held that a charge, which will confer priority, simply arises through a contract, [...] "where in a transaction for value both parties evince an intention that property, existing or future, shall be made available as security for the payment of a debt, and that the creditor shall have a present right to have it made available, there is a charge". This means a charge simply arises by virtue of contractual freedom. Legal and equitable charges are two of four kinds of security created through consent recognised in English law. A legal charge, more usually called a mortgage, is a transfer of legal title to property on condition that when a debt is repaid title will be reconveyed. An <b>equitable</b> <b>charge</b> used to be distinct in {{that it would not be}} protected against bona fide purchasers without notice of the interest, but now registration has removed this distinction. In addition the law recognises a pledge, where a person hands over some property in return for a loan, and a possessory lien, where a lender retains property already in their possession for some other reason until a debt is discharged, but these do not require registration.|$|E

In this article, we argue that current strategies for <b>equitable</b> <b>charging,</b> based on the valuing of water as a resource, inadequately account for social and geographical differentiation in supply and demand.

50|$|While real {{property}} may be divided among co-owners and tenants {{for the purpose}} of the land's use and enjoyment, taking a mortgage of property primarily serves the purpose of ensuring loans are repaid. Because of the nature of money lending, and frequently unequal bargaining power between banks and borrowers, the law gives significant legal protection to borrowers against the enforcement of unfair bargains. Along with pledges, liens and <b>equitable</b> <b>charges,</b> English law counts a mortgage as one of four main kinds of security interest, whereby a proprietary right that binds third parties is said to arise on conclusion of a contract. It must simply be the contract's intention to make property available to secure repayment. The Law of Property Act 1925 section 85 say that a mortgage requires a deed (under LPMPA 1989 section 1, a document that is signed, witnessed and states it is a deed). Under the Land Registration Act 2002 sections 23 and 27, a notice of a mortgage must be filed with HM Land Registry for the mortgage to be effective. Then, Law of Property Act 1925, section 87 says mortgages confer upon the mortgagee (i.e. the secured lender) the same rights as a 3000-year lease holder.|$|R

Most of the projects are deployed as community centred projects. In {{most of the cases}} the initial deployment of these projects is funded by governments, multilateral institutions and non-governmental organizations. After the initial deployment, financial sustainability remains one of the greatest challenges facing these projects. In the light of this, externally funded ICT 4 D interventions should just be used for “bootstrapping” purposes. The communities should be “groomed” to take care of and sustain these projects, eliminating as soon as possible a dependency on external funding. This master thesis presents the design and the implementation of a generic architecture for the management of the costs associated with running a computer network connected to the Internet, The proposed system, called the Network Revenue Management System, enables a network to generate revenue, by charging users for the utilization of network resources. The novelty of the system resides in its flexibility and adaptability, which allow the exploration of both conventional and non-conventional billing options, via the use of suitable ‘adapters’. The final goal of the exploration made possible by this system is the establishment of what is regarded as <b>equitable</b> <b>charging</b> in rural, marginalized communities - such as the community in Dwesa, South Africa...|$|R

40|$|Commonly {{employed}} in corporate rescue situations, the Quistclose trust (from Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd [1970] AC 567) is {{a device that}} enables an investor to advance funds to a troubled company {{to be used for}} a specific purpose. If the recipient company becomes insolvent before the money is spent then the funds will be held on trust for the original lender, thus ensuring that the property is not available for distribution amongst the company's unsecured creditors. This thesis examines both the theory and context of Quistclose trusts. It is argued that, whilst the devices are most commonly found in insolvency situations, the Quistclose analysis should be available wherever property is transferred for a specific purpose. Thus the paper identifies and discusses such issues as the 'requirement' of segregation of the trust property, the specificity of purpose necessary, and the type of property that may be subject to a Quistclose trust. The context of the Quistclose trust is also examined by reference to other security devices: <b>equitable</b> <b>charges</b> and retention of title agreements. Similarities and differences are identified and analysed in the context of insolvency regimes: should Quistclose trusts be subject to legislative controls, given their apparent ability to circumvent legislative provisions? Various commentators have attempted to categorise Quistclose trusts as express trusts, resulting trusts, sui generis trusts, or even full beneficial transfers coupled with equitable rights to restrain misuse. Following consideration of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each proposal it is argued that Quistclose trusts can indeed be reconciled with accepted principle. However, it is also suggested that there is no single correct classification: depending on the most accurate construction of the parties' actions and intentions the proper analysis may involve an express trust, a resulting trust, or indeed no trust at all...|$|R

40|$|MW-mile and Postage-stamp methods is {{traditionally}} used by electric utilities {{to determine a}} fixed transmission cost among users of firm transmission service. MW-Mile method is charging the users by determining the actual paths the power follows through the network. however, this method {{is not sufficient to}} recover the total transmission system cost. The recover the total transmission system cost, the Postage stamp Method is adopted. This method is simple out its main drawback is that the chargers paid by each user do not reflect the actual use of the network but based on the average usage of the entire network. This paper proposes a new wheeling charges methodology using tracing-based postage stamp methods. The proposed method allocates transmission costs among the generators proportional to the total power delivered to the through transmission lines. The proposed method incorporates with generalized generation distribution factors to trace the contribution of each generator to the line flow. One unique feature of the proposed method is the consideration of the local load on the power flow allocation. Two case studies of 3 -bus and IEEE 14 -bus systems are used to illustrate the proposed method. results show that the proposed method provides fair and <b>equitable</b> wheeling <b>charges</b> to generators reflecting the actual usage of the transmission system...|$|R

Under the Land Registration Act 2002 sections 23 and 27, a notice of a mortgage must be filed with HM Land Registry for the mortgage to be effective. Then, Law of Property Act 1925 section 87 says mortgages confer upon the mortgagee (i.e. the secured lender) the same rights as a 3000-year lease holder. The reason for this reference to [...] "3000 years" [...] is that in a primitive protective measure, the common law said mortgage terms must always allow for the property to be redeemed in the end, when the debt is repaid. In the 18th century decision of Vernon v Bethell Lord Henley LC refused to enforce the conveyance of Vernon's sugar plantation in Antigua to a deceased London lender, Bethell, when Vernon had trouble repaying, even though some exchanges between the two had raised the possibility of giving up the land to satisfy the debt. Given the considerable interest paid already, Lord Henley LC held it would frustrate (or [...] "clog") Vernon's right to redeem property. As he put it protection for the borrower was warranted because [...] "necessitous men are not, truly speaking, free men, but, to answer a present exigency, will submit to any terms that the crafty may impose upon them". Accordingly, the rule developed that [...] "once a mortgage, always a mortgage", meaning a mortgage cannot be turned into a conveyance of the property by the operation of terms in an agreement. It means that a lender may at most sell a property to realise its value, but may not take ownership, and the borrower must always practically be able to get back the property. The rule was suspended for companies by the Companies Act 2006 section 739, and was criticised in Jones v Morgan for being inappropriate in commerce, but it still survives as a rudimentary common law method to protecting vulnerable borrowers.|$|R
40|$|S ince 1991 Australian {{universities}} have charged fees, paid in advance (up-front), for {{a proportion of}} students undertaking postgraduate courses. In this paper {{it is argued that}} this is poor public policy, for both economic and social reasons. The conceptual basis for this case is explained fully. Given the strength of argument, it is difficult to understand why different Commonwealth governments have allowed and encouraged the expansion of post-graduate up-front fees in this period. The policy situation is particularly hard to justify since a much more <b>equitable</b> and efficient <b>charging</b> arrangement, the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS), has been in place for undergraduates since 1989. The important point for policy is that HECS collects student charges contingent on incomes, and thus requires no payment at the point of entry. It is argued that a collection system of this type is a more correct policy for post-graduate education, and it is shown that such a reform can be implemented without administrative difficulties. In January 2001 the Federal Government announced intentions to change post-graduate fee arrangements consistent with the reform promoted in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Summary: This project {{provided}} policy-makers with {{an understanding}} of the complexity of property finance, its role in the supply of all housing types and tenures and the impact of the Global Financial Crisis on property lending. Description The researchers interviewed property developers and financiers in Western Australia, New South Wales and Victoria who were involved in high density, medium density in-fill and affordable housing developments. Debt finance remains crucial for developers to finance projects since it opens development opportunities for those without up-front capital and allows them to reduce risk. While some larger developers (e. g. Australian Real Estate Investment Trusts) have adequate access to finance, small to medium sized developers have faced difficulties especially since the global financial crisis. This has negatively impacted housing supply especially in-fill development. Financing affordable housing for the not-for-profit sector is materially assisted through the National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) although it does take time for lenders to understand such schemes. Financing further affordable housing development is limited, because banks treat loans to the sector as cash flow loans rather than loans against assets. Continued growth of the sector will make it easier to leverage finance in future. Policy-makers are unable to directly influence lending decisions but can make a difference to the general investment environment through: Recognising the diversity of developers in the industry and their differing responses to policy initiatives and the adverse effect planning uncertainty and excessive regulation can have on development feasibility. Involving the financial sector in planning reform to reduce uncertainty. Encouraging small and medium scale in-fill development by avoiding delays, <b>equitable</b> infrastructure <b>charging,</b> and flexibility around parking requirements. Partnering with developers through joint-venture arrangements (e. g. guaranteeing to purchase unsold units). Educating developers about low risk avenues for investment through demonstration programs, such as the Keystart shared home ownership scheme...|$|R
50|$|In {{some legal}} systems, {{perfection}} {{of a security}} interest requires notice {{to be given to}} a relevant third party. This most commonly arises in relation to security over a debt or other chose in action, notice being required to be given to the party owing the debt or holding the fund. Under English law, an often cited example is the well-known rule in Dearle v Hall. Under the rule if A is owed money by X, and then A grants an <b>equitable</b> <b>charge</b> over that debt to B, and then grants a second <b>equitable</b> <b>charge</b> over the same debt to C, then the ability to enforce the charge by either B or C against the money in X's hands is dependent upon the giving of notice to X.
