40|$|Several {{obstacles}} {{exist in}} the user interface design process which distract a developer from designing a good user interface. One {{of the problems is}} the lack of an application model to keep the designer in perspective with the application. The other problem is having to deal with massive user interface programming to achieve a desired interface and to provide users with correct help information on the interface. In this paper, we discuss an application model which captures information about an application at a high level, and maintains mappings from the application to specifications of a desired interface. The application model is then used to control the dialogues at rtmtime and can be used by a help component to automatically generate animated and textual <b>help.</b> <b>Specification</b> changes in the application model will automatically result in behavioral changes in the interface...|$|E

If {{most part}} of the difficulty comes from the activities of modeling and formalizing themselves, {{we think that the}} language used plays also a role.

It is then important to provide specifiers with tools to <b>help</b> write <b>specifications.</b> We present in this paper tools to <b>help</b> write <b>specification</b> for user-interfaces.

For instance, adding examples to a specification gives redundant information that may aid some readers, and can also be used to help ensure that the specification says what is intended.

Many of these enhancements were invented by other authors, but are not widely known. They have all been integrated into, a Larch-style behavioral interface specification language for C++.

Responding to {{lingering}} {{concerns about}} the reliability of SVARs, Christiano et al (NBER Macro Annual, 2006, "CEV") propose to combine OLS estimates of a VAR with a spectral estimate of long-run variance.

But in practice, spectral estimators suffer from small sample biases similar to those from VARs. Moreover, the spectral estimates contain information about serial correlation in VAR residuals and the VAR dynamics must be adjusted accordingly.

It <b>helps</b> the <b>specification</b> of antenna radiating parameters and improves the radio link performance evaluation.

40|$|Use-cases are {{touted as}} means {{to manage the}} {{complexity}} of object-oriented software specification. The UML use-case relationships provide the means to organize usecases, which in turn, organize use-case requirements. Analysts, unfortunately, have difficulty in determining the scope of a single use-case, as well as defining its elaborations. In response, we define a goal-directed modeling approach based upon foundational definitions for domain property, goal, requirement, and specification. The more formally defined goals guide use-case definition, organization, and enable analyses otherwise unavailable to conventional object-oriented analysis. Goal directed analysis with use-cases <b>helps</b> manage <b>specification</b> complexity. 1 MODELING WITH GOALS Software specification by use-cases has grown with the popularity of object-oriented software engineering [Weidenhaupt 1998].

Our proposal is multiview, use case-driven and UML-based; thus also objectoriented. However, also benefitting of some earlier work, notably in the Structured Analysis, we take a rather abstract view, trying to avoid a preemptive decision on the classes structuring the system to build; that is achieved not only making a sharp distinction between business/domain modelling and the system, but also dealing with the system at the requirement level as a black box, providing only the minimal structure needed to express the interactions with the context...|$|R

30|$|Access control {{models can}} be seen as design {{patterns}} to <b>help</b> the <b>specification</b> of policies. They all consider three main entities: the subject, the action, and the resource. In addition, some access control models propose abstractions. For Barker [9], these abstractions (he calls them categories) represent “any of several fundamental and distinct classes or groups to which entities may be assigned.” One of the advantages of using abstractions is simplifying policies. For instance, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) [10] uses the concept of role to group subjects according to their function in an organization. Other access control models propose abstractions for other elements. Organization-Based Access Control (OrBAC) [11] uses abstractions on all three main elements: roles abstract subjects, activities are for actions, and views for resources. Some access control models are designed for privacy like PBAC [12] that introduces the intent of the subject or P-RBAC [13] that extends RBAC with concepts like purpose, condition, and obligation. An exception is Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). ABAC does not introduce abstraction but is a specification pattern to express authorization policies using any abstraction.|$|R
