This was not an insignificant number, although the transformation of the Australian economy as a result of World War <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>by</b> no means as significant as that which occurred during World War II. The expansion of the steel industry that occurred during this time laid the foundation for future industrialisation.|$|E

I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>by</b> you. No matter if the ball beat me, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>by</b> you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E
500|$|Contestant Emmanuel Kelly {{appeared}} on the first episode of the season's audition show on 29 August 2011, and performed a rendition of John Lennon's [...] "Imagine". His performance earned a standing ovation from the judges and the audience. Keating was full of praise for Kelly, who then moved into {{the next round of}} competition. Keating told Kelly: [...] "I don't think I've ever been moved as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>by</b> that performance." [...] Kelly and his brother Ahmed were adopted by Children First Foundation boss, Moira Kelly, who is also the guardian of the once-conjoined Bangladesh twins, Krishna and Trishna. Kelly and his brother came from Iraq, where they were abandoned at an orphanage and both suffered limb deficiencies as a result of chemical warfare. During the third day of bootcamp, Sebastian eliminated Kelly from the competition, disappointed that he had forgotten words to his song the day before.|$|E

500|$|... "Take It Off" [...] {{was written}} by Kesha, {{alongside}} Dr. Luke and Claude Kelly. It was recorded at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, and at Dr. Luke's studio in that city. The song was produced by Luke with vocal editing done by Emily Wright. The main riff of the chorus {{is the same as}} that of The Streets of Cairo, also using a similar rhyme scheme and parallel phrasing. During an interview with Esquire magazine Kesha was asked about her song writing process and used [...] "Take It Off" [...] as an example of how her songs come to fruition. She explained that the song came about when she was out one night and was visiting a transsexual bar, stating, [...] "I have a song [...] called 'Take It Off' about when I went to a drag show, and how really turned on <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>by</b> these transvestite men taking clothes off.

500|$|Of the Rhodesian units {{involved}} in the battle, the most prolific in terms of kills was 3 Commando, RLI. The kopje was informally dubbed [...] "Hill 31" [...] by the Rhodesian troopers, after the number of guerrillas killed. Donald was widely applauded for his conduct of the Rhodesian action, with Sergeant Laurie Graham telling The Rhodesia Herald that [...] "It was a well commanded operation by Captain Donald ... at times exhilarating." [...] Cocks agrees. [...] "I remember how awed <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>by</b> Kip Donald's control of the battle," [...] he writes. [...] "He was controlling a good couple of hundred troops—RLI, RAR and TF, all spread out over several square kilometres, {{on all sides of}} the mountain." [...] More cadres had been killed in the battle than in any other internal contact up to that point, but after [...] "Hill 31", encounters such as this became more regular: as the war intensified {{and the size of the}} guerrilla incursions grew, the security forces would regularly engage groups of 50 insurgents or more inside Rhodesia.|$|E
2500|$|The haggadic utterances of Hoshaiah are numerous, {{scattered}} principally in Midrash Rabbah, {{which some}} have erroneously attributed {{to him because}} of the opening words [...] "R.

[...] In Genesis Rabbah, Hoshaiah's text {{with reference to the}} Creation is the verse [...] "Then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>by</b> him, as one brought up [...] with him" [...] (Prov. viii.30). He transposes the letters to read אומן ("an architect"), and explains that [...] "wisdom" [...] (the Torah) was used as an instrument by God to create the universe. He illustrates this by the example of an earthly king who, in building a palace, needs an architect with plans and specifications.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{marriage}} to Henri and her affair with Kennedy were over, Swanson married Michael Farmer (1902–1975) in August 1931. Because {{of the possibility}} that Swanson's divorce from La Falaise had not been final {{at the time of the}} wedding, she was forced to remarry Farmer the following November, by which time she was four months pregnant with Michelle Bridget Farmer, who was born on April 5, 1932. Swanson and Farmer divorced in 1934, after she became involved with married British actor Herbert Marshall. The media reported widely on her affair with Marshall. After almost three years with the actor, Swanson left him once she realized he would never divorce his wife, Edna Best, for her. In an early manuscript of her autobiography written in her own hand decades later, Swanson recalled: [...] "I was never so convincingly and thoroughly loved as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>by</b> Herbert Marshall." ...|$|E
