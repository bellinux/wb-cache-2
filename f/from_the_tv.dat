5|$|DuMont {{programs}} were by necessity low-budget affairs, {{and the network}} received relatively few awards <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> industry.

5|$|ARC is {{an audio}} link meant to replace other cables between the TV and the A/V {{receiver}} or speaker system. This direction is used when the TV {{is the one}} that generates or receives the video stream instead of the other equipment. A typical case is the running of an app on a smart TV such as Netflix, but reproduction of audio is handled by the other equipment. Without ARC, the audio output <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> needs to be routed by another cable, typically TOS-Link or coax, into the speaker system.|$|E

5|$|Items <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> series such as multi-perspective screens (as {{shown on}} the box cover) were popular for {{illustrating}} multiple viewpoints of an objective. The use of episode start and end graphics to mark the start and end of missions was also liked. The script was generally described as being a redeeming feature of the game, although fans of the series may find that the viewpoints, motives and reasoning of the villains isn't covered well. Cutscenes were singled out for particular praise by IGN, highlighting good use of camera angles and tight focus. Voice acting was generally popular, although some lines suffered from poor direction or emphasis. In contrast, device and ambiance sounds were well received with gunfire getting a particular mention.|$|E
