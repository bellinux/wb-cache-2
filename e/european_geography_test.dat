50|$|Finn (Cory Monteith) {{is worried}} that Puck (Mark Salling) will not graduate. Puck tells Finn that he only needs to pass a <b>European</b> <b>geography</b> <b>test</b> to graduate, and {{that he plans to}} flirt with his teacher to secure a passing grade. However, she rejects his overtures, telling him to study instead, and Puck decides to drop out. Later, while Puck is {{cleaning}} a client's swimming pool, his father (Thomas Calabro)—who he has not heard from in five years—shows up and asks Puck for money to pay his rent. Realizing that {{he does not want to}} turn out like his father—also a high school dropout—Puck enlists the other glee club males to help him study. After taking the test, he feels confident about his effort; however, he fails the test.|$|E

50|$|Often, {{test scores}} can be {{interpreted}} in both ways; answering 80% of the questions correctly on a <b>geography</b> <b>test</b> could place {{a student at the}} 84th percentile (that is, the student performed better than 83% of the class and worse than 16% of the classmates), or a standard score of 1.0 or even 2.0.|$|R
2500|$|The world {{landscape}} {{first appeared}} in painting {{in the work of}} the Early Netherlandish painter Joachim Patinir (c. 1480–1524), most of whose few surviving paintings are of this type, usually showing religious subjects, but commissioned by secular patrons. [...] "They were imaginary compilations of the most appealing and spectacular aspects of <b>European</b> <b>geography,</b> assembled for the delight of the wealthy armchair traveler", giving [...] "an idealized composite of the world taken in at a single Olympian glance".|$|R

25|$|Orosius' 5th-century Seven Books of History Against the Pagans was {{a popular}} work of history in the Middle Ages, with about 250 {{manuscript}} copies from that period surviving today. Late in the 9th century King Alfred of Wessex, or members of his court, appear to have seen it as a useful basis for a world-history written in their own language, and an Old English version may {{have been seen as}} complementary to Bede's 8th-century Ecclesiastical History of the English People and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was begun in Alfred's reign. The Old English version of Orosius is an adaptation rather than a direct translation, one of its features being the addition and correction of information concerning <b>European</b> <b>geography.</b> The addition of Ohthere's account of his travels, and that of another traveller named Wulfstan, represents part of that process.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} about the {{strategic}} forgetting of the Humboldtian ‘compromise’. The analysis looks {{to the ways in}} which the concept of landscape entered geography as a device uniquely able to match the Romantic imaginary of the emergent European bourgeoisie and this latter’s need for a scientific (and a-political) theory of knowledge. Humboldt’s geographical idea of landscape was precisely the ‘compromise’ that would provide the bourgeoisie with a new spatial theory. What I claim in this paper, following Franco Farinelli’s critical re-writing of the history of <b>European</b> <b>geography,</b> is that the nature of Humboldt’s attempt has been essentially cancelled from canonical disciplinary accounts, for a number of historical-political reasons. This accounts for why, even today, despite the achievements of the new cultural geography and the influence of nonrepresentational theories, landscapes all too often continue to be read either as texts or, worse still, as ‘real’ spaces and/or built environments...|$|R
