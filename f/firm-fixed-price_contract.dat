40|$|This audit was {{performed}} {{to follow up on}} actions taken in response to the July 1990 report on ``Procurement of Support Services for the Energy Information Administration`` (CR-OC- 90 - 2). The audit disclosed that over 50 % of the work under six of the cost-reimbursement contracts examined was recurring and could have been estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy making the work suitable for fixed-price contracting. The report made recommendations to the Head of Procurement and the Administrator, EIA. These recommendations were to comply with procurement regulations by identifying recurring tasks that were susceptible to fixed-price contracting, preparing definitive statements of work that would permit fixed-price contracting, and awarding fixed-price contracts. Procurement recognized the benefits of fixed-price contracting and agreed to work closely with the EIA to identify work susceptible to fixed-price contracting. These efforts resulted in the award of two labor hour <b>contracts</b> but no <b>firm-fixed-price</b> <b>contracts.</b> The purpose of this followup audit was to review Procurement and EIA actions to develop definitive work statements for recurring tasks that are suitable for <b>firm-fixed-price</b> <b>contracts.</b> The audit objective was to determine what progress Procurement and EIA have made in utilizing <b>firm-fixed-price</b> <b>contracts.</b> In FY 1996, EIA had 14 contracts valued at about $ 202 million that were issued as cost reimbursement and labor hour contracts...|$|R
2500|$|Ghazni {{province}} is to {{be connected}} to the national electrical distribution system via North-east Power System (NEPS). The construction of transmission line would begin from east Chimtala to Ghazni using high voltage transmission network (2 x 220kV transmission lines and power substations). The project {{is to be}} implemented by USFOR-A and USAID costing $101 mlllion. However the Asian Development Bank agreed to complete the transmission line from Chimtala to Dast-i-Barchi; hence reducing Project scope to begin from Dast-i-Barchi instead of Chimtala. The implemention of this project was delayed due to [...] USACE being unable to award a contract because bids received for the project were more than double estimated costs, due largely to security concerns resulting from the risks associated with implementing <b>firm-fixed-price</b> <b>contracts</b> in a kinetic environment, poor cost estimates, and unrealistic periods of performance. USACE is re-procuring both projects and plans to award contracts in June or July 2012, which will delay the project's execution schedules between 6 and 15 months. Furthermore, the delays in transferring funds contributed to delays in project execution. This line is a key part of a planned NEPS to SEPS connection to transport power to Kandaharto replace the expensive diesel-fueled power plants ...|$|R
