40|$|I am {{often asked}} how I {{can put a}} customer’s web site {{at the top of}} a search engine. The idea has somehow been {{implanted}} into business owner minds that the number one spot on Google search engine will result in instant success. This is far from the case. In fact we teach that even having a web site doesn’t guarantee success in business. I know what you are thinking. Why is a web development company like Dreamwright Web Design Studios telling customers that a web site will not bring them success? It’s the same reason why financial analysts don’t tell their clients to buy lottery tickets every day as a sound retirement plan. No one thing will result in instant success. The key to marketing your business is diversity. You need a web site but it can’t be the only marketing your business has. A web site should be your anchor. In other words, a web site should the central location that all your other marketing points to. You need a web site because it is a 24 -hour brochure of company information with call-to-actions to capture interest. Everything else you do should point to your web site. If you hand a client your business card and it doesn’t contain your web site address you missed an opportunity. Your business card alone may not have enough information to convince your potential customer. If you have a blog or social media site page like facebook, twitter, or linkedin and never refer to your web site you again have missed an opportunity. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> web site on your company vehicles? You need to diversify your marketing by empowering other avenues that all eventually redirect back to your anchor: you...|$|E
