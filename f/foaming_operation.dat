Newtonian model fluids were formulated with controlled rheology and interfacial properties. The viscosity has been modified by changing the dilution of glucose syrup and surface tension has been modified by using two different surfactant species (whey protein and sucrose ester).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to investigate the role of cold rolling on the foaming ability (or foamability) of aluminium precursors, made by continuous rotary extrusion, a process performed at elevated temperature, starting by powder. For this purpose, the effect of different parameters including initial shape of precursors, rolling direction, amount of deformation in each rolling pass and final thickness of rolled specimens are experimentally investigated. Furthermore, the foaming efficiency of both rolled precursors and as-received extruded ones is compared. To clarify the role of secondary processing operations on the foaming efficiency, precursor samples are prepared following different forming and machining process chains, before the final <b>foaming</b> <b>operation.</b> Finally, hardness tests are performed on as-received precursors and rolled samples to notice the correlation between rolling parameters, state of strain, foaming efficiency and hardness. The results of the study show that: (a) cold rolling considerably improves foamability, (b) rectangular precursor bars have higher foaming efficiency than round ones, both before and after cold rolling. Besides, the improvement in foamability due to cold rolling is greater if precursors are rolled in the extrusion direction, rather than the orthogonal direction. © 2013 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

40|$|Foams {{represent}} an important {{area of research}} because of their relevance to many industrial processes. In continuous <b>foaming</b> <b>operations,</b> <b>foaming</b> ability depends on the process parameters and {{the characteristics of the}} raw materials used for foamed products. The effects of fluid viscosity and equilibrium surface tension on foam structure have been studied extensively. Furthermore, as surface active agents diffuse to the interface, they can modify other interface properties through their adsorption, such as interfacial rheology and surface tension kinetics. In order to better understand how these two interfacial properties influence foam structuring, we formulated model foaming solutions with different interface viscoelasticity levels and adsorption rates, but all with the same equilibrium surface tension and viscosity. The solutions were made up of a surface active agent and glucose syrup, so as to maintain a Newtonian behaviour. Five surface active agents were used: Whey Protein Isolate (WPI), sodium caseinate, saponin, cetyl phosphate and Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS), at concentrations ranging from 0. 1 % to 1 %. Their molecular characteristics, and their interaction with the glucose syrup, made it possible to obtain a range of interface viscoelasticities and surface tension kinetics for these model solutions. The solutions were whipped in a continuously-operating industrial foaming device in order to control process parameters such as shearing and overrun, and to ensure that the experiment was representative of industrial production. The structure of the foams thus obtained foams was then determined by characterising bubble size using image analysis. For all the model solutions, both the viscoelastic moduli and apparent diffusion coefficient were linked to foam structure. The results showed that both high interface viscoelasticity and rapid diffusion kinetics induced a foam structure containing small bubbles. Both effects, as well as the impact of the shearing rate, through the rotor speed, were then integrated in a predictive model for bubble size...|$|R

40|$|The use of foam as a {{drilling}} fluid {{was developed to}} meet a special set of conditions under which other common drilling fluids had failed. Foam drilling is defined as the process of making boreholes by utilizing foam as the circulating fluid. When compared with conventional drilling, underbalanced or foam drilling has several advantages. These advantages include: avoidance of lost circulation problems, minimizing damage to pay zones, higher penetration rates and bit life. Foams are usually characterized by the quality, the ratio of the volume of gas, and the total foam volume. Obtaining dependable pressure profiles for aerated (gasified) fluids and foam is more difficult than for single phase fluids, since in the former ones the drilling mud contains a gas phase that is entrained within the fluid system. The primary goal {{of this study is to}} expand the knowledge-base of the hydrodynamic phenomena that occur in a <b>foam</b> drilling <b>operation.</b> In order to gain a better understanding of <b>foam</b> drilling <b>operations,</b> a hydrodynamic model is developed and run at different operating conditions. For this purpose, the flow of foam through the drilling system is modeled by invoking the basic principles of continuum mechanics and thermodynamics. The model was designed to allow gas and liquid flow at desired volumetric flow rates through the drillstring and annulus. Parametric studies are conducted in order to identify the most influential variables in the hydrodynamic modeling of foam flow...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{study the effects of}} {{molecular}} interactions between proteins upon foam quality in batch and continuous operations, and to investigate foam fractionation as a method of protein recovery from real biological feedstocks. Foam stability studies of model protein solutions acted as engineering indicators and highlighted the importance of electrostatic interactions between basic (lysozyme and cytochrome-c) and acidic proteins (BSA) upon foamability and foam stability. Batch and continuous <b>foam</b> <b>operations</b> were employed in the study of electrostatic interactions between BSA and lysozyme and their effects upon foam quality. Batch foam production at pH 8. 0 strongly demonstrated the importance of molecular stoichiometry upon individual protein partition into foam. Maximal lysozyme recovery was achieved at equimolar conditions and coincided with minimal fractionation between the two proteins. Continuous foaming demonstrated that foam positive proteins such as BSA (collector) can function as mobile ion-exchangers for poor foaming agents such as lysozyme (colligend). Experimentation with real biological systems such as brewer's yeast extract indicated that complex protein systems appear to behave like single protein solutions in terms of the effects of operating parameters upon foam performance. Such behaviour was confirmed by preliminary studies with bovine heart muscle homogenate. "Dry" foams, in continuous foam processing of brewer's yeast extract, were associated with dilute feedstocks, low gas flowrate and prolonged liquid residence times. They were characterised by high protein enrichment, low recovery, enhanced protein fractionation from RNA, but suffered extensive protein precipitation. Studies of dynamic changes in foam bubbles showed that such phenomena are associated with extensive coalescence. It was concluded that, although single protein model systems can offer valuable information on foam fractionation, direct comparisons with real biological solutions should be treated with care. A need for further study on the role of protein interactions upon foaming was also identified. Finally, the currently held view of rejecting foaming as a source of protein precipitation should be reviewed and advancements in foam fractionation as a preliminary step in downstream processing should employ the development of semi-empirical predictive models...|$|R

30|$|Recently, a new {{drilling}} fluid {{technology has been}} developed {{in an attempt to}} eliminate just these discussed problems. This novel technology is based on aphrons—uniquely structured micro-bubbles of air. The air used to generate aphrons is usually incorporated into the fluid with conventional fluid-mixing equipment at ambient pressure, thereby reducing costs and safety concerns associated with conventional air and <b>foam</b> drilling <b>operations.</b> Since the amount of air in the fluid is very low, normally 12 – 15  vol% at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure (Berkin et al. 2005), the density of the fluid downhole {{is similar to that of}} the base fluid. The aphrons behave like solid, yet flexible bridging materials, and can adjust the shape automatically according to the size of fractures, cavern, or openings to control lost circulation with minimum formation damage. It has been successfully used in California, Lake Maracaibo, North Sea, China, and Albert (He 2010), and has been proven to be a cost-effective alternative to underbalanced drilling.|$|R
40|$|In {{commercial}} slabstock foaming, liquid CO 2 {{technology is}} increasingly applied to replace previously used liquid auxiliary blowing agents like CFCs and methylene chloride. Knowledge of physical properties of mixtures {{which are used}} in liquid CO 2 foaming {{may contribute to the}} further development of the liquid CO 2 technology. Equations have been determined which do predict, for specific operational conditions and formulations, the pressures which are required in commercial <b>foam</b> <b>operation</b> to keep the CO 2 dissolved both in the polyol/CO 2 and in the foaming mixture/CO 2 solutions. The evident dependence on temperature Of CO 2 solubility, established for both polyol and foaming mixtures, strongly supports tight temperature control of the feedstocks in slabstock liquid CO 2 foaming. The solubility of CO 2 in polyol was found to increase with the EO content of the polyol where the effect of molecular weight was found to be negligible. It was established that small amounts of water and surfactant lower the CO 2 solubility, and it is predicted that the commonly used levels of TDI do the same. Based on this information, it is advisable to conduct the mixing of TDI and auxiliary components at pressures a fraction higher than the saturation pressure of the liquid CO 2 polyol mixture. A significant decrease of both viscosity and surface tension is quantified for polyol and model foaming systems at increasing liquid CO 2 concentration. These decreases may explain why very small cell sizes can be obtained with liquid CO 2 foaming, as the nucleation process takes place at high liquid CO 2 concentration. The rise in viscosity upon evaporation Of CO 2 into the froth may explain the relative stability of the unreacted froth. A cooling capacity of about 1 degreesC per part of CO 2 per hundred parts of polyol is determined from two independent experiments. However, for safety reasons, it is advisable to keep the current assumption of 0 degreesC per part of CO 2 per hundred parts of polyol in commercial foaming until a further study on the temperature evolution of liquid CO 2 blown foaming under practical conditions is conducted...|$|R

The concentrationof the auxiliary blowing agent are quite low due to the accepted practice of using large volumes of air to lower the ambient concentration of toxic isocyanates (a key chemical in the urethane reaction sequences). The manufacturing process was simulated in the laboratory. The magnitudes and rates of auxiliary blowing agent loss were quantified and related to stages in the <b>foam</b> blowing <b>operation.</b> These data were validated with analogous measurements at foam plants. A mathematical model was developed to predict tunnel auxiliary blowing agent concentrations as a function of formulation, tunnel length, conveyor speed, and air flow.

The discovery of the one-way shape-memory effect in PU foams provided a fresh impetus for extensive investigations on porous polymeric actuators over the past decades. High expansion ratios during the shape-recovery are of special interest when big volume changes are required, for example to fill an aneurysm during micro-invasive surgery or save space during transportation. However, the need to program the <b>foams</b> before each <b>operation</b> cycle could be a drawback impeding the entry of shape-memory polymeric (SMP) foams to our daily life.

We selected commercially available crystallizable poly(ε-caprolactone) -diols of different molecular weight for foams synthesis, followed by investigations of morphology, thermal, thermomechanical and shape-memory properties of obtained compositions. Densities of synthesized foams varied from 110 to 180 kg∙m− 3, while peak melting temperatures were composition-dependent and changed from 36 to 47 °C, while the melting temperature interval was around 15 K.

Problems remain, however, for applying underbalanced drilling in a wider range of geological settings and drilling environments. This report addresses developments under this DOE project to develop products aimed at overcoming these problems. During Phase I of the DOE project, market analyses showed that up to 12, 000 wells per year (i. e., 30 % of all wells) will be drilled underbalanced in the U. S. A. within the next ten years. A user-friendly foam fluid hydraulics model (FOAM) was developed for a PC Windows environment during Phase I. FOAM predicts circulating pressures and flow characteristics of foam fluids used in underbalanced drilling <b>operations.</b> <b>FOAM</b> is based on the best available mathematical models, and was validated through comparison to existing models, laboratory test data and field data. This model does not handle two-phase flow or air and mist drilling where the foam quality is above 0. 97. This FOAM model was greatly expanded during Phase II including adding an improved foam rheological model and a ''matching'' feature that allows the model to be field calibrated. During Phase I, a lightweight drilling fluid was developed that uses hollow glass spheres (HGS) to reduce the density of the mud to less than that of water. HGS fluids have several advantages over aerated fluids, including they are incompressible, they reduce corrosion and vibration problems, they allow the use of mud-pulse MWD tools, and they eliminate high compressor and nitrogen costs. Phase II tests showed that HGS significantly reduce formation damage with water-based drilling and completion fluids and thereby potentially can increase oil and gas production in wells drilled with water-based fluids. Extensive rheological testing was conducted with HGS drilling and completion fluids during Phase II. These tests showed that the HGS fluids act similarly to conventional fluids and that they have potential application in many areas, including underbalanced drilling, completions, and riserless drilling. Early field tests under this project are encouraging. These led to limited tests by industry (which are also described). Further field tests and cost analyses are needed to demonstrate the viability of HGS fluids in different applications. Once their effectiveness is demonstrated, they should find widespread application and should significantly reduce drilling costs and increase oil and gas production rates.

40|$|Testing was {{performed}} to determine the feasibility and processing characteristics of an evaporation process to reduce {{the volume of the}} recycle stream from the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). The concentrated recycle would be returned to DWPF while the overhead condensate would be transferred to the Effluent Treatment Plant. Various blends of evaporator feed were tested using simulants developed from characterization of actual recycle streams from DWPF and input from DWPF-Engineering. The simulated feed was evaporated in laboratory scale apparatus to target a 30 X volume reduction. Condensate and concentrate samples from each run were analyzed and the process characteristics (foaming, scaling, etc) were visually monitored during each run. The following conclusions were made from the testing: Concentration of the ''typical'' recycle stream in DWPF by 30 X was feasible. The addition of DWTT recycle streams to the typical recycle stream raises the solids content of the evaporator feed considerably and lowers the amount of concentration that can be achieved. Foaming was noted during all evaporation tests and must be addressed prior to operation of the full-scale evaporator. Tests were conducted that identified Dow Corning 2210 as an antifoam candidate that warrants further evaluation. The condensate has the potential to exceed the ETP WAC for mercury, silicon, and TOC. Controlling the amount of equipment decontamination recycle in the evaporator blend would help meet the TOC limits. The evaporator condensate will be saturated with mercury and elemental mercury will collect in the evaporator condensate collection vessel. No scaling on heating surfaces was noted during the tests, but splatter onto the walls of the evaporation vessels led to a buildup of solids. These solids were difficult to remove with 2 M nitric acid. Precipitation of solids was not noted during the testing. Some of the aluminum present in the recycle streams was converted from gibbsite to aluminum oxide during the evaporation process. The following recommendations were made: Recycle from the DWTT should be metered in slowly to the ''typical'' recycle streams to avoid spikes in solids content to allow consistent processing and avoid process upsets. Additional studies should be conducted to determine acceptable volume ratios for the HEME dissolution and decontamination solutions in the evaporator feed. Dow Corning 2210 antifoam should be evaluated for use to control foaming. Additional tests are required to determine the concentration of antifoam required to prevent foaming during startup, the frequency of antifoam additions required to control foaming during steady state processing, and the ability of the antifoam to control foam over a range of potential feed compositions. This evaluation should also include evaluation of the degradation of the antifoam and impact on the silicon and TOC content of the condensate. The caustic HEME dissolution recycle stream should be neutralized to at least pH of 7 prior to blending with the acidic recycle streams. Dow Corning 2210 should be used during the evaporation testing using the radioactive recycle samples received from DWPF. Evaluation of additional antifoam candidates should be conducted as a backup for Dow Corning 2210. A camera and/or foam detection instrument {{should be included in the}} evaporator design to allow monitoring of the <b>foaming</b> behavior during <b>operation.</b> The potential for foam formation and high solids content should be considered during the design of the evaporator vessel...|$|R
