5|$|Chemotherapy agents used in {{combination}} {{have been found}} to be effective against neuroblastoma. Agents commonly used in induction and for stem cell transplant conditioning are platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin), alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, <b>ifosfamide,</b> melphalan), topoisomerase II inhibitor (etoposide), anthracycline antibiotics (doxorubicin) and vinca alkaloids (vincristine). Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and irinotecan) in induction which {{have been found to}} be effective against recurrent disease.|$|E
5|$|Temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, {{is under}} {{investigation}} as a potential treatment. Research shows that mTOR inhibitors may be particularly effective for cancers with mutations in PTEN. Ridaforolimus (deforolimus) is also being researched {{as a treatment for}} people who have previously had chemotherapy. Preliminary research has been promising, and a stage II trial for ridaforolimus was completed by 2013. There has also been research on combined ridaforolimus/progestin treatments for recurrent endometrial cancer. Bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which inhibit angiogenesis, are being researched as potential treatments for endometrial cancers with high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor. Ixabepilone is being researched as a possible chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Treatments for rare high-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma are being researched, as there is no established standard of care yet for this disease. Chemotherapies being researched include doxorubicin and <b>ifosfamide.</b>|$|E
25|$|Standard {{therapy is}} a {{combination}} of limb-salvage orthopedic surgery when possible (or amputation in some cases) and a combination of high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, intra-arterial cisplatin, adriamycin, <b>ifosfamide</b> with mesna, BCD (bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin), etoposide, and muramyl tripeptide. Rotationplasty may be used. <b>Ifosfamide</b> can be used as an adjuvant treatment if the necrosis rate is low.|$|E
25|$|Some {{types of}} {{chemotherapy}} are gonadotoxic and may cause infertility. Chemotherapies with high risk include procarbazine and other alkylating {{drugs such as}} cyclophosphamide, <b>ifosfamide,</b> busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil, and chlormethine. Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin. On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycin and dactinomycin, and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine, and 5-fluorouracil.|$|E
25|$|The subtypes of alkylating {{agents are}} the {{nitrogen}} mustards, nitrosoureas, tetrazines, aziridines, cisplatins and derivatives, and non-classical alkylating agents. Nitrogen mustards include mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, chlorambucil, <b>ifosfamide</b> and busulfan. Nitrosoureas include N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU), carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU) and semustine (MeCCNU), fotemustine and streptozotocin. Tetrazines include dacarbazine, mitozolomide and temozolomide. Aziridines include thiotepa, mytomycin and diaziquone (AZQ). Cisplatin and derivatives include cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin. They impair cell function by forming covalent bonds with the amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups in biologically important molecules. Non-classical alkylating agents include procarbazine and hexamethylmelamine.|$|E
2500|$|Another use of {{methylene}} blue {{is to treat}} <b>ifosfamide</b> neurotoxicity. Methylene blue was first reported for treatment and prophylaxis of <b>ifosfamide</b> neuropsychiatric toxicity in 1994. A toxic metabolite of <b>ifosfamide,</b> chloroacetaldehyde (CAA), disrupts the mitochondrial respiratory chain, leading to an accumulation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen (NADH). Methylene blue acts as an alternative electron acceptor, and reverses the NADH inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis while also inhibiting the transformation of chloroethylamine into chloroacetaldehyde, and inhibits multiple amine oxidase activities, preventing the formation of CAA. [...] The dosing of {{methylene blue}} for treatment of <b>ifosfamide</b> neurotoxicity varies, depending upon its use simultaneously as an adjuvant in <b>ifosfamide</b> infusion, versus its use to reverse psychiatric symptoms that manifest after completion of an <b>ifosfamide</b> infusion. Reports suggest that methylene blue up to six doses a day have resulted in improvement of symptoms within 10 minutes to several days. Alternatively, {{it has been suggested}} that intravenous methylene blue every six hours for prophylaxis during <b>ifosfamide</b> treatment in patients with history of <b>ifosfamide</b> neuropsychiatric toxicity. [...] Prophylactic administration of methylene blue the day before initiation of <b>ifosfamide,</b> and three times daily during <b>ifosfamide</b> chemotherapy has been recommended to lower the occurrence of <b>ifosfamide</b> neurotoxicity.|$|E

2500|$|Hair loss (Alopecia) can {{be caused}} by {{chemotherapy}} that kills rapidly dividing cells; other medications may cause hair to thin. [...] These are most often temporary effects: hair usually starts to regrow {{a few weeks after the}} last treatment, and can sometimes change colour, texture, thickness and style. Sometimes hair has a tendency to curl after regrowth, resulting in [...] "chemo curls." [...] Severe hair loss occurs most often with drugs such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, cyclophosphamide, <b>ifosfamide</b> and etoposide. Permanent thinning or hair loss can result from some standard chemotherapy regimens.|$|E
2500|$|After {{receiving}} {{a letter from}} Steven Wolff, an oncologist at Vanderbilt University, Armstrong went to the Indiana University medical center in Indianapolis [...] and decided to receive {{the rest of his}} treatment there. The standard treatment for Armstrong's cancer was a [...] "cocktail" [...] of the drugs bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (or Platinol) (BEP). The first chemotherapy cycle that Armstrong underwent included BEP, but for the three remaining cycles, he was given an alternative, vinblastine etoposide, <b>ifosfamide,</b> and cisplatin (VIP), to avoid lung toxicity associated with bleomycin. Armstrong credited this with saving his cycling career. At Indiana University, Lawrence Einhorn had pioneered the use of cisplatin to treat testicular cancer. Armstrong's primary oncologist there was Craig Nichols. On October 25, his brain lesions which were found to contain extensive necrosis, were surgically removed by Scott A. Shapiro, a professor of neurosurgery at Indiana University.|$|E

50|$|Both, evofosfamide and <b>ifosfamide</b> {{have been}} {{investigated}} in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma. The study TH-CR-403 is a single arm trial investigating evofosfamide in combination with doxorubicin.

50|$|Hemorrhagic {{cystitis}} is rare when <b>ifosfamide</b> {{is given}} with mesna. A common and dose-limiting side effect is encephalopathy (brain dysfunction). It occurs {{in some form}} in up to 50% of people receiving the agent. The reaction is probably mediated by chloroacetaldehyde, one of the breakdown products of the <b>ifosfamide</b> molecule, which has chemical properties similar to acetaldehyde and chloral hydrate. The symptoms of <b>ifosfamide</b> encephalopathy can range from mild (difficulty concentrating, fatigue), to moderate (delirium, psychosis), to severe (nonconvulsive status epilepticus or coma). In children, this can interfere with neurological development. Apart from the brain, <b>ifosfamide</b> can also affect peripheral nerves. The severity of the reaction can be classified according to either the National Cancer Institute or the Meanwell criteria (grade I-IV). Previous brain problems {{and low levels of}} albumin in the blood increase the likelihood of <b>ifosfamide</b> encephalopathy. In most cases, the reaction resolves spontaneously within 72 hours. If it develops during an infusion of the drug, discontinuing the infusion is advised. The most effective treatment for severe (grade III-IV) encephalopathy is an intravenous solution of methylene blue, which appears to shorten the duration of encephalopathy; the exact mechanism of action of methylene blue is unclear. In some cases, methylene blue may be used as a prophylaxis before further doses of <b>ifosfamide</b> are administered. Other treatments include albumin and thiamine, and dialysis as a rescue modality.|$|E

50|$|Phosphorodiamidate-based, DNA-crosslinking, bis-alkylator mustards {{have long}} been used {{successfully}} in cancer chemotherapy and include e.g. the prodrugs <b>ifosfamide</b> and cyclophosphamide. To demonstrate that known drugs of proven efficacy could {{serve as the basis}} of efficacious hypoxia-activated prodrugs, the 2-nitroimidizole HAP of the active phosphoramidate bis-alkylator derived from <b>ifosfamide</b> was synthesized. The resulting compound, TH-281, had a high HCR (hypoxia cytotoxicity ratio), a quantitative assessment of its hypoxia selectivity. Subsequent structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies showed that replacement of the chlorines in the alkylator portion of the prodrug with bromines improved potency about 10-fold. The resulting, final compound is evofosfamide (TH-302).|$|E
50|$|Glufosfamide, being a {{conjugate}} of glucose {{and active}} alkylating moiety of <b>ifosfamide,</b> has the better cell permeability than the parent compound — <b>ifosfamide</b> — or its metabolites. Glufosfamide utilizes the normal cell glucose transport mechanism (a sodium-dependent glucose/sodium co-transporter) {{for its own}} transport into the cell. And the glucose uptake mechanism is grossly overexpressed and upregulated in certain cancer cell lines, especially pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and glioblastoma multiforme. This, theoretically, should render them {{more sensitive to the}} alkylating effects of glufosfamide while relatively sparing (doing relatively little collateral damage) to the normal cells in which the glucose uptake mechanism is not so upregulated.|$|E
50|$|Artificial {{cell enzyme}} therapy is also of {{interest}} for the activation of prodrugs such as <b>ifosfamide</b> in certain cancers. Artificial cells encapsulating the cytochrome p450 enzyme which converts this prodrug into the active drug can be tailored to accumulate in the pancreatic carcinoma or implanting the artificial cells close to the tumor site. Here, the local concentration of the activated <b>ifosfamide</b> will be much {{higher than in the}} rest of the body thus preventing systemic toxicity. The treatment was successful in animals and showed a doubling in median survivals amongst patients with advanced-stage pancreatic cancer in phase I/II clinical trials, and a tripling in one-year survival rate.|$|E
