40|$|Political and {{socioeconomic}} {{factors have been}} linked to innovations in government, but most evidence is based on the study of policy <b>innovation</b> rather than <b>management</b> <b>innovation.</b> Policy innovations studies can provide insights into what factors may influence <b>management</b> <b>innovations</b> in municipal governments and agencies. However, we argue that the study of public <b>management</b> <b>innovations</b> should also consider factors related to institutions, bureaucracy, networks, and regional competition as well as political {{and socioeconomic}} characteristics. Some municipal governments have no formally planned economic development strategy despite their complex and competitive environment. This article investigates adoption of a strategic economic development plan as a municipal <b>management</b> <b>innovation.</b> A model of municipal <b>management</b> <b>innovation</b> is tested with data from ICMA surveys conducted in 1989 and 1999 using logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression analyses. The findings suggest <b>management</b> <b>innovations</b> are influenced by different factors than policy innovations. Institutions, bureaucratic networks, and regional competition are important factors in explaining <b>management</b> <b>innovations</b> and deserve greater attention in the literature.

40|$|Abstract:- <b>Management</b> <b>innovation</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} factors to promote the development of the industry system except capital, labor and technology. But a little attention is paid to the effects of <b>management</b> <b>innovation</b> on telecommunication industry system, which results in two questions: what’s the contribution of <b>management</b> <b>innovation</b> on industry development? And how does <b>management</b> <b>innovation</b> affect industry development? This paper addresses the two main research questions by taking China’s telecommunication industry as an example. The Cobb-Douglas production function model is improved to measure the contribution of <b>management</b> <b>innovation,</b> and the mode of <b>management</b> <b>innovation</b> affecting industrial development is also explained. The results show that <b>management</b> <b>innovation</b> exerts great influences on telecommunication industry system with its contribution degree increasing gradually, and <b>management</b> <b>innovation</b> is the core element relating labor, capital and technology in industry development. Based on these, dynamic models for the industry system are constructed, and conclusions and implications are given in the final part of the paper...|$|R

25|$|Measuring {{innovation}} is inherently {{difficult as it}} implies commensurability so that comparisons {{can be made in}} quantitative terms. Innovation, however, is by definition novelty. Comparisons are thus often meaningless across products or service. Nevertheless, Edison et al. in their review of literature on <b>innovation</b> <b>management</b> found 232 innovation metrics. They categorized these measures along five dimensions i.e. inputs to the innovation process, output from the innovation process, effect of the innovation output, measures to access the activities in an innovation process and availability of factors that facilitate such a process.|$|E
