25|$|Synchronized diving {{was adopted}} as an Olympic sport in 2000. Two divers form {{a team and}} perform dives simultaneously. The dives are identical. It used to be {{possible}} to dive opposites, {{also known as a}} pinwheel, but this is no longer part of competitive synchronized diving. For example, one diver would perform a <b>forward</b> <b>dive</b> and the other an inward dive in the same position, or one would do a reverse and the other a back movement. In these events, the diving would be judged both on the quality of execution and the synchronicity – in timing of take-off and entry, height and forward travel.|$|E
25|$|In the 2013 season, for {{the third}} {{straight}} year, the Bengals clinched a playoff berth and also won the AFC North, finishing with an 11–5 record. But once again, the Bengals were defeated in the wild card round, this time by the San Diego Chargers, 27–10. Most of the blame was put on Andy Dalton, who threw 2 interceptions and fumbled on a <b>forward</b> <b>dive.</b> This made the Bengals 0–5 in playoff games since Mike Brown took over as owner. The 2014 season started well with the Bengals winning their first three contests against the Baltimore Ravens, the Atlanta Falcons, and the Tennessee Titans. However, they lost their week 5 matchup at the New England Patriots, 43–17. An overtime tie to the Carolina Panthers and shutout loss to the Indianapolis Colts followed the primetime loss to the Patriots. Finishing the season 10–5–1 as the 5th seed, they lost to the Colts, 26–10, {{in the first round of}} the playoffs. This was the first time the franchise made the playoffs four straight seasons.|$|E
2500|$|As the diver {{leaves the}} board, the total angular {{momentum}} vector is horizontal, pointing {{directly to the}} left for a <b>forward</b> <b>dive</b> for example.

5000|$|A dive roll is an acrobatic stunt {{that begins}} with a {{horizontal}} <b>forward</b> <b>diving</b> motion and results in a forward roll. Alternate forms such as a Jigaree are also notable.

40|$|While {{there has}} been much {{research}} published on the kinematics and kinetics of <b>forward</b> <b>dives</b> from a springboard, very little has been done on the effect the timing and magnitude of hip flexion torques has on <b>forward</b> <b>dives.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the relationship between the timing and magnitude of hip flexion torques prior to the take-off and the vertical velocity at take-off in high demand rotational <b>forward</b> <b>dives.</b> Twenty-six elite divers (14 males and 12 females) competing in the United Kingdom leg of the 2001 FINA Diving Grand Prix performed high demand rotational dives. The males performed a forward three and one-half somersault dive in the pike position (107 B) whilst the females performed a forward two and one-half somersault dive in the pike position (105 B) off the 3 m springboard. A video camera operating at 60 Hz recorded all dives in the preliminaries and finals. Video footage was digitised from the 10 frames preceding touchdown from the hurdle to 10 frames following take-off to yield vertical and horizontal velocity and angular displacement data. Furthermore, the hip joint torque was calculated via a six segment 2 ̆ 7 top-down 2 ̆ 7 model. An independent sample t-test was used to determine whether there were any significant differences between the two gender groups for selected variables whilst a Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s Product Moment Correlation Coefficient (r) was calculated for both the male and female divers to establish whether the timing and magnitude of the peak hip flexion torque had an influence on vertical velocity at last contact and dive score. Results showed that the male divers produced significantly (...|$|R
50|$|Compensated variometers {{also include}} {{information}} about {{the speed of the}} aircraft, so the total energy (potential and kinetic) is used, not just the change in altitude. For example, if a pilot pushes forward on the stick, speeding up as the plane dives, an uncompensated variometer only indicates that altitude is being lost. But the pilot could pull back on the stick, trading the extra speed for altitude again. A compensated variometer uses both speed and altitude to indicate the change in total energy. So the pilot that pushes the stick <b>forward,</b> <b>diving</b> to gain speed, and then pulls back again to regain altitude will notice no change in total energy on a compensated variometer (neglecting energy loss due to drag).|$|R

50|$|The {{competition}} was actually held from both 3 metre and 1 metre boards. Divers performed a running plain dive and a running forward somersault from the 1 metre board, a one-and-a-half somersault and a backward spring and <b>forward</b> <b>dive</b> from the 3 metre board, and three dives of the competitor's choice from the 3 metre board.

500|$|The three Malta-based {{boats were}} sent to the Dardanelles in mid-September 1914 to prevent a sortie by the German battlecruiser [...] and the light cruiser [...] into the Eastern Mediterranean. The {{entrance}} to the Dardanelles was patrolled from dawn to dusk by these boats as well as four French submarines which arrived later. Neither the British nor the French submarines had enough battery power or underwater speed to combat the south-flowing currents in the Dardanelles to reach the Sea of Marmara, but B11 was selected for a sortie that would attempt to penetrate as far as the town of Chanak, halfway up the Dardanelles, because she had the newest, and thus most powerful, batteries. Special guards were fitted over the <b>forward</b> <b>diving</b> planes to make sure that any mooring wires of mines would not get entangled and dragged down to the boat.|$|R
50|$|A gainer is the acrobatic {{trick of}} {{performing}} a backwards somersault while still moving <b>forward.</b> In <b>diving,</b> {{this is known}} as reverse rotation (as opposed to front, back, or inward). Many stunt performers and martial artists are capable of performing a similar skill on the ground, sometimes in combination with a midair inverted kick.|$|R

40|$|A {{linguistic}} and cultural analysis of diving site names {{and their role}} as toponyms is absent in Pacific research and studies into scuba diving tourism. This article analyzes a corpus of 38 diving site names collected during interview-based fieldwork on Norfolk Island. The analyses demonstrate that the naming of Norfolk Island diving sites can {{be perceived as a}} type of tourism management – through the names, diving sites are ascribed varying degrees of linguistic, cultural, and historical significance. Previous studies in tourism research have argued that tourism can be perceived as a modern form of pilgrimage, and that the naming of tourism sites is a way of sacralizing sites in order to emphasize their importance within processes of pilgrimage. The results of this article reveal empirically that Norfolk diving sites are part of a sacralization process, where transference of the cultural, historical, and environmental significance from names as language to locations as place occurs. The article puts <b>forward</b> <b>diving</b> site names not only as a toponymic taxon of interest to toponymy and linguistics but also for island and coastal studies in the Pacific and elsewhere.

Kinematic data were obtained using high-speed video recordings of performances of a <b>forward</b> <b>dive</b> pike (101 B) and a forward 2 ½ somersault pike dive (105 B) by an elite diver. Nine parameters for each torque generator were taken from dynamometer measurements on an elite gymnast. The isometric torque parameter for each torque generator was then varied together with torque activation timings until the root mean squared (RMS) percentage difference between simulation and performance in terms of joint angles, orientation, linear momentum, angular momentum, and duration of springboard contact was minimised for each of the two dives. The two sets of isometric torque parameters were combined into a single set by choosing the larger value from the two sets for each parameter. Simulations using the combined set of isometric torque parameters matched the two performances closely with RMS percentage differences of 2. 6...|$|E
