5|$|Madness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fast</b> <b>Lane</b> is the BBC documentary, first {{broadcast}} on BBC One on 10 August 2010, which brought {{the story of}} Sabina and Ursula Eriksson and the killing of Glen Hollinshead into the public consciousness. The footage on the M6 motorway of the two women jumping into the passing traffic had previously been {{broadcast on}} Motorway Cops, {{but this was the}} first time the rest of the story had been told.|$|E
25|$|The race {{restarted}} {{at the end}} of lap {{three with}} Rosenqvist being forced to defend first place from Lynn after losing fraction in his tyres from driving behind the safety car. Lynn steered to the outside of Rosenqvist going into Lisboa corner and turned in to take over the lead. Félix da Costa overtook Auer for third on the run up to Mandarin Oriental bend, and Auer lost a further place to Marciello at Lisboa turn. Auer then crashed heavily into the barriers at San Francisco bend while defending from Derani, ending his race early. Shortly after Jones hit a bump going off the racing line at Fisherman's Bend and made contact with the wall. Yellow flags were waved in the area but were withdrawn after he was removed from the circuit. Up front Lynn continued to lead Rosenqvist while Félix da Costa was being hounded by Marciello for third. Similarly King was battling Sims for fifth with Coletti, Buller and Ocon running in close formation in a battle for sixth. Mason was handed a drive-through penalty after his team started his engine while stationary <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> <b>lane</b> of the pit lane. Sims managed to get ahead of King for fifth and began closing up to Derani. Buller overtook Coletti while Sainz passed Korjus for eleventh. On the fifth lap and heading towards Lisboa corner, Marciello moved in front of Félix da Costa for third.|$|E
500|$|Martha, Milo, and Cheen {{drive into}} the fast lane and begin to hear strange noises all around. A nearby driver warns them to escape into the slow lanes before being eaten by the creatures that live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> <b>lane,</b> but Milo refuses. [...] The Doctor, finding himself in a van just above the fast lane, looks out the bottom and discovers that {{the floor of the}} Motorway is filled with Macra. The Macra are monstrous crab-like alien beings that were once {{intelligent}} but now have devolved into feral beasts, who attempt to capture and eat those that fly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> <b>lane.</b> [...] The Doctor watches as Milo's van is nearly caught by a Macra claw, but Martha realises that the beings are attracted by the light and motion generated by the van and has Milo cut the power. [...] This saves them from the beasts but leaves them with only a few minutes of breathable air in the van.|$|E

[...] While the Doctor talks to a vendor, Martha is kidnapped at gun point by a young couple named Milo and Cheen. Once in their vehicle, they explain that Cheen is pregnant and that they needed three adult passengers with them to use the fast lane. They promise they will drop Martha off when they reach their destination ten miles away, estimated to take six years. Cheen also mentions rumours about something living down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> <b>lane,</b> saying that cars that go down there vanish and are never seen again.|$|E

50|$|Shortly after midnight, a {{westbound}} driver drifted out of lane; she {{was later}} ruled {{to have been}} legally drunk at the time. Her car struck the tunnel wall, stopping <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left-hand (<b>fast)</b> <b>lane</b> almost halfway through the tunnel. The driver got out to inspect the damage. The initial crash created a bottleneck for traffic coming up behind. However due to the late hour of the crash, there were few other vehicles on the road, generally traveling at high speed.|$|R

50|$|Enter <b>the</b> 1960s. Travelling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proverbial <b>fast</b> <b>lane</b> {{became a}} rapid {{trip down the}} wrong speedway. Weiss {{eventually}} found himself in jail, buck naked, his life in “total shambles,” playing the “wrong” instrument to support a dead-end life style. In that moment of clarity, Weiss decided to “put everything down, including playing music.” His love affair with his horn, that harshest of mistresses, was put on hiatus. Still, unable to disassociate himself from music completely, Weiss began working at a music store, and eventually opened his own store, The Sheet Music Shoppe which grew into the largest purveyor of printed music <b>in</b> Southern California.In <b>the</b> summer of 2001, Weiss read an advertising flyer that asked “Do You Want to Play Jazz?” The timing was perfect. It {{was enough to make}} him dust off his clarinet case, begin practicing, and soon invite guitarist Ron Eschete to jam. Their collaboration led to a recording session that became the 2-CD set No Place to Hide, the release that launched Weiss'SMS Jazz label.|$|R
40|$|The Department of Journalism, Film and Television <b>in</b> {{partnership}} with <b>the</b> UJ Library invites {{you to a}} discussion with Jani Allan, the author of Jani Confidential – A Memoir About the book: Those who remember the Just Jani column <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sunday Times will be intrigued and delighted. Those who missed out on those heady times will be captivated by this universal story of betrayal, back-stabbing and life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> very <b>fast</b> <b>lane.</b> It is acerbic, witty, wry, bittersweet and exquisitely penned. She describes how she became a columnist, and reveals much of life behind the scenes at the Sunday Times. Jani shares details of the crucial interview with Eugène Terre’blanche, details that will shake the preconceptions and ruffle {{more than a few}} feathers. Jani’s reputation is reduced to tatters when she takes on UK’s Channel 4 in a law suit that reverberated around the world and kept the public baying for blood. But in all this we are able to see the real Jani Allan behind the fabulous brittle creature that the tabloids tore to shreds and devoured and then spat out.

30|$|In this paper, a micro-simulation {{model is}} put forward to make {{evaluation}} of traffic flow characteristics including safety condition. The model has some advantages over the classic CA model. A partial test {{has been conducted}} and the validity of our model is preliminarily verified. Future work can focus on the following aspects. First, some basic assumptions can be loosened. The probability distribution of the arrival of vehicles, for example, can be calibrated through real traffic flow data instead of Poisson distribution assumption. Second, methods to determine the model parameters can be focused on. Visibility {{is probably one of}} the most important factors that make a great difference to the proposed four characteristic distance. Third, the validity of our model requires further and more rigorous verifications. One possible method is to calculate the actual capacity of targeted freeway section on the basis of basic capacity, and comparison can be made between the calculation and the results obtained by our simulation. Another method is based on real flow data. Comparing, the data with the simulation results including speed, density, and delay, the validity of the model will be more strictly proved. Finally, multilane freeway traffic simulation can be achieved though the rules of vehicle state update in this study ought to be slightly revised. Taking three-lane freeway as an example, rules such that small cars never run <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right (nearside) lane while large cars never run <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left (<b>fast)</b> <b>lane</b> are necessary to make an extension of the proposed micro-simulation model.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to explore a concept based on {{performance}} optimization of road pavement structures with various fractions of subgrade layer and asphalt pavement thickness. The project has a total of 14 test sections located in K 1 and K 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northbound direction on road E 4 between Skånes Fagerhult and Markaryd. These were observed with measurements 2004 to 2010. The follow-up was effected by cross profile measurements and falling weight measurements. The follow-up was carried out on 8 test sections á 100 m and 6 test sections á 40 m. <b>The</b> asphalt pavement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right (slow) lane consists of 40 mm wearing course, 45 mm bitumen base course and 95 mm bitumen roadbase with 80 mm gravel roadbase beneath. <b>The</b> asphalt pavement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left (<b>fast)</b> <b>lane</b> has <b>the</b> same wearing and bitumen base course but not any bitumen roadbase. The subbase vary between the sections from 60 cm crushed rock 0 - 300 mm to 42 cm crushed rock 0 - 150 mm or crushed rock 0 - 90 mm. All the test sections are situated on embankment of varied height. The road was opened for traffic in 2004, but was then trafficked on the bitumen base course. The wearing course was constructed late in summer 2005 after about one year of traffic. The road served 4 years until the summer of 2009 when the wearing course of the right lane was maintained with a remixing. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> left lane no maintenance was done. The first measurement at the test sections with the new wearing course was conducted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring of 2006 after {{it had been in}} service approximately 1 year. In spring 2009 a profile measurement was done before the maintenance operation. The latest profile measurement was carried out <b>in</b> autumn 2010. <b>The</b> rut depth has been calculated according the thread principle...|$|R
