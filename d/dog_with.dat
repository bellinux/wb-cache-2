40|$|<b>Dogs</b> <b>with</b> {{liver disease}} {{have been shown}} to have {{increased}} serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. However, it is unclear whether <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> liver disease also have increased serum haptoglobin concentrations. The aim {{of the study was to}} measure serum haptoglobin concentrations in healthy dogs, hospitalised <b>dogs</b> and <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> liver diseases. Haptoglobin concentrations were measured in 30 healthy dogs, 47 hospitalised <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> non-hepatic illness, 46 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> congenital portosystemic shunt (cPSS) and 11 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> primary hepatopathy. Haptoglobin concentrations were not significantly different between cPSS <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> and without hepatic encephalopathy (HE), thus all cPSS dogs were considered as one group. Haptoglobin concentrations were significantly different between the remaining groups (P&# 60; 0. 0001). Hospitalised ill dogs had significantly higher haptoglobin concentrations than healthy dogs (P&# 60; 0. 001), <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> cPSS (P&# 60; 0. 001) and <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> primary hepatopathy (P&# 60; 0. 05).

40|$|Background Pulmonary {{hypertension}} (PH) is {{a disease}} condition leading to right-sided cardiac hypertrophy and, eventually, right-sided heart failure. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is a circulating biomarker of cardiac damage. Hypothesis Myocardial damage can occur in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> precapillary and postcapillary PH. Animals One hundred and thirty-three dogs were examined: 26 healthy controls, 42 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> mitral valve disease (MVD) without PH, 48 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> pulmonary hypertension associated with mitral valve disease (PH-MVD), and 17 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> precapillary PH. Methods Prospective, observational study. Serum cTnI concentration was measured with a commercially available immunoassay and results were compared between groups. Results Median cTnI was 0. 10 ng/mL (range 0. 10 - 0. 17 ng/mL) in healthy <b>dogs.</b> Compared <b>with</b> the healthy population, median serum cTnI concentration was increased in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> precapillary PH (0. 25 ng/mL; range 0. 10 - 1. 9 ng/mL; P <. 001) and in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> PH-MVD (0. 21 ng/mL; range 0. 10 - 2. 10 ng/mL; P <. 001). Median serum cTnI concentration of <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> MVD (0. 12 ng/mL; range 0. 10 - 1. 00 ng/mL) was not significantly different compared with control group and <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> PH-MVD.

40|$|Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis (IPF) is characterised by an abnormal accumulation of collagen type III in the pulmonary interstitium. Procollagen type III amino terminal propeptide (PIIINP) {{is used as}} a marker of collagen type III synthesis. In this study, the concentrations of PIIINP were investigated in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> IPF (n= 15), <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> chronic bronchitis (CB, n= 19), <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> eosinophilic bronchopneumopathy (EBP, n= 13) and healthy dogs (n= 25). PIIINP concentrations in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analysed by radioimmunoassay. Serum PIIINP values did not differ between groups, indicating that serum PIIINP is not useful in evaluating respiratory diseases in dogs. BALF PIIINP was significantly elevated in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> IPF compared <b>with</b> healthy <b>dogs</b> (P= 0. 002) and <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> CB (P<. 0. 001). BALF PIIINP was significantly higher in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> EBP than in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> CB (P= 0. 003) or healthy dogs (P= 0. 022). There were no differences in BALF PIIINP concentrations between <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> IPF and <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> EBP or between <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> CB and healthy dogs.

ANIMALS: Fourteen <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> HAC, 7 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> PHEO, and 10 healthy dogs. METHODS: Prospective clinical trial. Urine was collected during initial work-up in the hospital; in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> HAC an additional sample was taken at home 1 week after discharge. Parameters were measured usinghigh-pressure liquid chromatography and expressed as ratios to urinary creatinine concentration. RESULTS: <b>Dogs</b> <b>with</b> HAC had significantly higher urinary epinephrine, norepinephrine and normetanephrine to creatinine ratios than healthy dogs. Urinary epinephrine, norepinephrine, and metanephrine to creatinine ratios did not differ between <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> HAC and <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> PHEO, whereas the urinary normetanephrine to creatinine ratio was significantly higher (P=. 011) in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> PHEO (414, 157. 0 - 925. 0, median, range versus (117. 5, 53. 0 - 323. 0).

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} serum calcium-phosphorus concentration product (sCaPP) as {{a predictor}} of mortality rate in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> chronic kidney disease (CKD). DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study. ANIMALS: 31 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> definitive CKD and 35 apparently healthy dogs. PROCEDURES: All dogs had been referred for nephrological consultation between December 2008 and December 2010. <b>Dogs</b> <b>with</b> CKD had stable disease for ≥ 3 months. On the basis of glomerular filtration rate 442 μmol/L (11). For each dog, serum concentrations of ionized and total calcium and phosphorus were evaluated once; the latter 2 variables were used to determine sCaPP. RESULTS: The sCaPP differed significantly between the 22 healthy <b>dogs</b> and <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> stage 3 or stage 4 CKD. The proportion of <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> sCaPP > 70 mg(2) /dL(2) increased with stage of disease.

In <b>dogs</b> treated <b>with</b> DOCP, PRA was lower than in <b>dogs</b> treated <b>with</b> FC. Plasma sodium concentrations were higher and potassium concentrations were lower with DOCP treatment compared to FC treatment. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE Plasma renin activity is a reliable tool for monitoring mineralocorticoid treatment. DOCP treatment more effectively suppresses PRA compared to FC in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> PH...|$|R
