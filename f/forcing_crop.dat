40|$|Assessments of {{agricultural}} productivity and food security require process-based crop models to provide predictions of yields and diagnose past {{variations in the}} context of anthropogenic and climate factors. These models need detailed meteorological data as input, including precipitation, temperature, humidity, solar radiation and windspeed. This project aimed to apply existing methods to merge in situ, remotely sensed and modeled data sources in East and West Africa to produce high-quality daily meteorological data over at least 30 years. Specific objectives included: evaluation of the error structure of the dataset, its temporal and spatial characteristics and consistency and its suitability for <b>forcing</b> <b>crop</b> models, and to provide a framework for merging new data, in particular from the local stations of regional African partners, ensuring consistency across time and space and among variables, as well as the best use of information. The work successfully created a 10 kilometre, daily meteorological dataset for East and West Africa for the period 1979 – 2008, based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP–NCAR) reanalysis (NNR), merged with observational datasets, including the monthly gridded precipitation and temperature product of the University of East Anglia’s Climate Research Unit (CRU), the NASA Langley Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) product, and station data from the Global Summary of the Day (GSOD) database...|$|E
40|$|Increasing water {{scarcity}} and {{growing demand for}} food have made better management of land and water resources essential to maintaining the sustainability of irrigated agriculture. Policies designed to improve environmental quality and irrigated production need to be analyzed in an integrated framework. We present a catchment-scale hydrologic-economic model of irrigated agriculture which is dynamic and spatially distributed. It {{can be used to}} evaluate land and water policies designed to manage irrigation-induced salinization. The model incorporates hydrologically realistic representations of groundwater flow and soil salinization into an economic optimization framework. The sum of discounted net revenues from irrigation over the planning horizon is maximized by choosing annual areas planted to each crop in each of the economic subregions. The groundwater system is represented using a linear state-space model derived from a finite-difference approximation of the groundwater flow equation. The number of groundwater states is substantially reduced using balanced truncation, a technique used in control engineering. A simple representation of the salinization process is derived from detailed numerical simulations of unsaturated zone flow and salt transport. These detailed simulations include realistic meterological <b>forcing,</b> <b>crop</b> root extraction, and the effect of shallow, saline watertables. The use of the model for policy analysis is demonstrated in a case study of the Lower Murrumbidgee Catchment. The study area is in the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia and includes a major irrigation district threatened by salinization from rising watertables. We first simulate socially optimal management over a 15 -year planning horizon. The socially optimal solution internalizes the externalities of the common-pool groundwater system and allows redistribution of water allocations to different areas. This solution is compared to scenarios which include the common-pool externality and policy options in various combinations. The policy options considered are a restriction on the amount of cropland planted to rice and the trading of surface water allocations. We find the rice area restriction decreases economic net benefits while water trading increases net benefits. There is little difference between the social optimum and the common-pool scenarios suggesting that the cost of the common-pool externality is small. by Christopher M. Stubbs. Thesis (Ph. D.)

To study the economic impact of an increasing erosion constraint at the farm and the watershed scales, four Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models, corresponding to three selected farms and the watershed, were built. The models maximize the sum of field net margins subject to singleness of field use, animal nutrient requirements, and erosion. Scenario results show that increasing the erosion constraint: (1) reduces soil loss from agricultural production; (2) <b>forces</b> <b>cropping</b> patterns and farming practices to change; (3) reduces profits; and (4) induces marginal and average costs to increase at an increasing rate.

The essence of this work is to improve on the performance of grain thresher through a model that will optimize the performance characteristics (velocity, crop feed rate, concave clearance, threshing drum impact <b>force,</b> <b>crop</b> flow rate) of a thresher and minimize its grain damage or losses. To achieve this, equations were derived which describe the threshing rate, threshing loss, grain damage, efficiency and threshing capacity. The equations were used to simulate and optimize the threshing performance of the model. The model was validated with published threshing performance data and it was found generally to fit well, taking R 2 values equal to or greater than 0. 9 which is highly significant (α= 0. 000). The developed model enables optimal parameters to be selected for a design in which the objective function (grain damage or losses) is minimized. At 16 % moisture level, minimal loss is 3. 6792 % and efficiency of 92. 32 % while the performance characteristics are v = 9 m/s, Q = 0. 12 kg/s, c = 0. 015 m...|$|R
