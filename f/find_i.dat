My only consolation…is that it is the second-greatest box-office attraction in the country." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 23, 1998, Madonna {{appeared}} on the Spanish RTVE show El Séptimo de Caballeria and performed [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love", along with her other song [...] "The Power of Good-Bye". Three years later, Madonna named her 2001 Drowned World Tour after the song, and performed it as the opening number. She entered the stage amidst billows of dry ice, dressed in a sleeveless black top, crossover top with one net sleeve, jeans with zips and bondage straps, a studded dog collar and a tartan kilt and performed the song standing on a [...] rising platform on {{the middle of the}} stage. Also during this same tour, the last lyrics from the song ("Now, I <b>find</b> <b>I</b> changed my mind/This is my religion") were used {{at the end of the}} performance of [...] "Ray of Light". The performance at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan on August 26, 2001 was released in the live video release, Drowned World Tour 2001. Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH gave the performance a positive review, saying it was sung beautifully. Joshua Clover from Spin described Madonna's arrival during the performance as [...] " [...] taking the style war to stage".|$|E
500|$|Inglis was {{involved}} with the Cambridge University Officer Training Corps (CUOTC), being commissioned a second lieutenant on 24 May 1909. [...] He served with the CUOTC's engineering detachment and noticed that when the unit was deployed on field days {{with the rest of}} the force it often had little to do. To remedy this, Inglis designed a reusable steel bridge, with the intention that it could be erected and dismantled by the unit in a single afternoon. [...] An army general who was inspecting the unit noticed his design and offered advice: [...] "If you're making anything for the army, keep it simple– no complicated gadgets". [...] Upon the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Inglis volunteered for active service in the British Army and was officially listed as an Assistant Instructor in the School of Military Engineering, with the temporary rank of lieutenant. [...] The army expressed interest in Inglis' bridge design; it was approved for use by a panel of army officers that included the general who had first commented on the design, to whom Inglis said [...] "I hope, Sir, you will <b>find</b> <b>I</b> have profited by your advice". [...] The design remained in service with the British Army until the higher-capacity Bailey bridge was introduced during the Second World War.|$|E

His work was described by the critic Jean-Luc Daval as [...] "the true nouvelle figuration." [...] In response to Picasso's phrase [...] "I do not search, I find", Messagier would scribbled a few years before the end of his life, [...] "I do not <b>find,</b> <b>I</b> search." [...] In this phrase, writes Alexandre Rolla, [...] "Jean Messagier gives some clues as {{to the nature of the}} gesture", the stance he defended throughout his life, and observed throughout his oeuvre, [...] "a winding path that should be explored today, to consider, finally, the importance of this work in the history of art." ...|$|E

He never made a break from his parents, but they rarely knew where he was. Sometimes he came home and his mother would have to sew $100 bills into the seams of his blue jeans. He disappeared in Nicaragua. His body was later identified as a dead Sandinista freedom fighter.

2500|$|Dembski has not {{explained}} {{the origin of}} the intelligent designer that created the universe, which he argues is unnecessary, since such an intelligent designer is likely outside the dimensions of space and time, or to have any of his pro-intelligent design articles published in the peer-reviewed mainstream scientific journals. While intelligent design proponents often claim that such failure to get articles published is due to an alleged pro-evolution bias or conspiracy, Dembski himself has said that he prefers to disseminate his ideas in non-peer-reviewed media: [...] "I've just gotten kind of blasé about submitting things to journals where you often wait two years to get things into print. And I <b>find</b> <b>I</b> can actually get the turnaround faster by writing a book and getting the ideas expressed there. My books sell well. I get a royalty.

2500|$|In 1945, {{his mother}} Martha married British army major Kenneth Stoppard, {{who gave the}} boys his English surname and, in 1946, after the war, moved the family to England. His {{stepfather}} believed strongly that [...] "to be born an Englishman was to have drawn first prize in the lottery of life"– a quote from Cecil Rhodes– telling his small stepson: [...] "Don't you realise that I made you British?" [...] setting up Stoppard's desire as a child to become [...] "an honorary Englishman". [...] "I fairly often find I'm with people who forget I don't quite belong in the world we're in", he says. [...] "I <b>find</b> <b>I</b> put a foot wrong– it could be pronunciation, an arcane bit of English history– and suddenly I'm there naked, as someone with a pass, a press ticket." [...] This is reflected in his characters, he notes, who are [...] "constantly being addressed by the wrong name, with jokes and false trails {{to do with the}} confusion of having two names". Stoppard attended the Dolphin School in Nottinghamshire, and later completed his education at Pocklington School in East Riding, Yorkshire, which he hated.|$|E
2500|$|Rather than {{inferring}} {{the ancestral}} DNA sequence, {{one may be}} interested in the larger-scale molecular structure and content of an ancestral genome. This problem is often approached in a combinatorial framework, by modelling genomes as permutations of genes or homologous regions. Various operations are allowed on these permutations, such as an inversion (a segment of the permutation is reversed in-place), deletion (a segment is removed), transposition (a segment is removed from one part of the permutation and spliced in somewhere else), or gain of genetic content through recombination, duplication or horizontal gene transfer. The [...] "genome rearrangement problem", first posed by Watterson and colleagues, asks: given two genomes (permutations) and a set of allowable operations, what is the shortest sequence of operations that will transform one genome into the other? [...] A generalization of this problem applicable to ancestral reconstruction is the [...] "multiple genome rearrangement problem": given a set of genomes and a set of allowable operations, <b>find</b> (<b>i)</b> a binary tree with the given genomes as its leaves, and (ii) an assignment of genomes to the internal nodes of the tree, such that the total number of operations across the whole tree is minimized. [...] This approach is similar to parsimony, except that the tree is inferred along with the ancestral sequences. [...] Unfortunately, even the single genome rearrangement problem is NP-hard, although it has received much attention in mathematics and computer science (for a review, see Fertin and colleagues).|$|E
2500|$|On 18 June Pitt heard Fitzwilliam's {{objection}} {{from the}} Duke of Portland. Pitt assured [...] "that the re-establishment of the Crown of France in such {{person of the}} family of Bourbon as shall be naturally entitled to it was the first and determined aim of the present Ministry". Pitt wished to discuss this with Fitzwilliam in person. On 23 June Fitzwilliam wrote to the Duke of Portland that he believed the government had moved to the Whig position and that [...] "for my own part I am now ready, not only to adopt the opinion that a junction should take place, as your sentiment, but to advise it as the genuine offspring of my own judgement... as much weight and sway should be given to us as possible. ... In my humble opinion, this junction will not produce half its effect if it is not opened to the world by such marks of real substantial favour and confidence {{on the part of the}} Crown towards us as will mark beyond dispute the return of weight, power and consideration to the Old Whigs...after thirty years' exclusion from patronage in the line of peerage" [...] new Whig peers should be created. He also rejected office except of [...] "going to Ireland, but...it is impossible". However the Duke of Portland and Lord Mansfield implored Fitzwilliam to accept office and when Lord Mansfield saw Fitzwilliam when he came down to London on 28 June he got Fitzwilliam [...] "to admit that if ever he was to take office this was the time". The next day Fitzwilliam met the Duke of Portland and reported that: [...] "I see little prospect of escaping office...the duke...seems so intent upon my accepting, as almost to say that he will not, if I do not—I left him last night my reasons for thinking that I should be more serviceable out of office, than in...if I <b>find</b> <b>I</b> have not persuaded him, I must submit". When Pitt met the Duke of Portland on 1 July he offered the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland to Fitzwilliam as soon as Lord Westmoreland could be compensated for the loss of it. Therefore, on 3 July Fitzwilliam agreed to join the coalition government as Lord President of the Council for the time being, writing that day to Lady Rockingham: [...] "It is a time when private affection must give way to public exigency".|$|E
