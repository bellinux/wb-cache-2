While the ALARA approach is widely applicable to all substances in food that are both carcinogenic and genotoxic, it does not take carcinogenic potency into account and, therefore, does not permit prioritisation based on potential risk or concern. In the absence of carcinogenicity dose-response data, an assessment based on comparison with an appropriate threshold of toxicological concern may be possible. When carcinogenicity data from animal bioassays are available, a useful analysis is achieved by the calculation of margins of exposure (MOEs), which can be used to compare animal potency data with human exposure scenarios. Two reference points on the dose-response relationship {{that can be used for}} MOE calculation were examined; the T 25 value, which is derived from linear extrapolation, and the BMDL 10, which is derived from mathematical modelling of the dose-response data. The above approaches were applied to selected food-borne <b>genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens.</b> The proposed approach is applicable to all substances in food that are DNA-reactive <b>genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> and enables the formulation of appropriate semi-quantitative advice to risk managers.

However, there is little information as to if or when expression changes of miRNAs occur in normal tissues after carcinogen exposure. Results To explore the possible time-course changes of miRNA expression induced by a carcinogen, we treated mice with one dose of 120 mg/kg N -ethyl- N -nitrosourea (ENU), a model <b>genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogen,</b> and vehicle control. The miRNA expression profiles were assessed in the mouse livers in a time-course design. miRNAs were isolated from the livers at days 1, 3, 7, 15, 30 and 120 after the treatment and their expression was determined using a miRNA PCR Array. Principal component analysis of the miRNA expression profiles showed that miRNA expression at post-treatment days (PTDs) 7 and 15 were different from those at the other time points and the control. The number of differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) changed over time (3, 5, 14, 32, 5 and 5 at PTDs 1, 3, 7, 15, 30 and 120, respectively). The magnitude of the expression change varied with time with the highest changes at PTDs 7 or 15 {{for most of the}} DEMs. In silico functional analysis of the DEMs at PTDs 7 and 15 indicated that the major functions of these ENU-induced DEMs were associated with DNA damage, DNA repair, apoptosis and other processes related to carcinogenesis.

People almost universally view the human (mammal) {{body as a}} biological organ with biochemical processes controlling biological cells. This fails to recognize the vital role of biophysics with its electromagnetic signals carrying out vital functions in the brain, central nervous system, heart, motor neuron system and in all cells. Oscillating electromagnetic signals, produced by and interacting with ions, such as calcium ions, are active in all cells for cell-to-cell communication, gap junctions and voltage-gated ion channels. Phase locked loop detection systems are widespread in cells and especially neurons. The heart and brain are monitored using the ECG and EEG electromagnetic detection systems. Classical physics processes involve resonant absorption and interference with the natural EMR/EMF signals. This has been causally demonstrated with external ELF signals altering the ELF calcium ion oscillations in brain and heart tissue. Understanding and appreciating this biophysical science, opening your mind to the genotoxic evidence, and considering the epidemiological evidence, leads to a major paradigm shift. External EMR/EMF signals penetrate human bodies, resonantly interacting with cellular processes, altering cellular calcium ions, reducing melatonin and damaging DNA. Everyone has their whole body exposed to these genotoxic signals showing that EMR/EMF is a Ubiquitous Universal <b>Genotoxic</b> <b>Carcinogen,</b> that causes elevation of the rates {{of a wide range}} of cancer, cardiac, reproductive and neurological diseases and death in human populations.

So far, there is agreement on distinguish-ing between genotoxic and nongenotoxic chemicals; yet, further differentiations seem appropriate. For <b>genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens,</b> case studies of chemicals point to many possibilities for assessing carcinogenic risk. There are numerous, apparently genotoxic carci-nogens where practical thresholds are a matter of discussion. For instance, positivedata of chromosomal effects only, in the absenceof mutagenicity,may support the characterization of a compound that produces carcinogenic effects only at high, toxic doses. There is a wide consensus that for non-DNA-reactive genotoxicants, such as aneugens, thresholds should be defined. Specific mechanisms of clastogenicity have been repeatedly addressed as alsohaving thresh-olds, such as topoisomerase II poisons, or mechanisms based on reactive oxygen.

The mitogenic actions of L-FABP were protein-specific, inasmuch as no other protein in the nonexpressing cells could act like L-FABP. L-FABP was previously shown not only (i) to interact covalently with metabolites of the two <b>genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> 2 -acetylaminofluorene and aminoazo dyes during liver carcinogenesis, but also (ii) to bind noncovalently the two classes of PP in vitro with avidities that correlate with their abilities to elicit peroxisomal enzymatic responses, and (iii) together with unsaturated fatty acids, especially linoleic acid, to promote multiplication of the transfected hepatoma cells in culture. The convergence of the two types of <b>genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> with the two classes of PP nongenotoxic carcinogens, and also with unsaturated fatty acids, at L-FABP actions in inducing mitogenesis allows the following hypothesis.

Over the 20 th century these fields have contributed a major proportion of the increase in cancer, by a factor of 50 to 80 % of the 6 - to 7 -fold total increase, because of the unique ubiquitous nature of exposures to the EM fields and the RF/MW radiation. There is robust evidence of the oscillating electromagnetic spectrum from ELF to RF/MW being Genotoxic and Carcinogenic. Therefore this generates the Ubiquitous <b>Genotoxic</b> <b>Carcinogen</b> Effect (UGCE) which results from the absence of a nonexposed control group.

The genotoxic nature of these fields is so strong that exposed parents pass cancer, including Brain Cancer, on to their children. This review shows that there is strong and robust evidence that chronic exposures to ELF/RF/MW fields across the spectrum, through strength, consistency, biological plausibility and many dose-response relationships, cause increased rates of Brain/CNS Cancer from residential and occupational exposures.

Metronidazole is mutagenic for microorganisms, but has a mainly negative data base for mammals and humans. Therefore, metronidazole is generally considered as a non-genotoxic carcinogen. Only the results of two human in vivo studies would allow the classification of metronidazole as genotoxic carcinogen: (1) the induction of DNA strand breaks; and (2) the induction of chromosome aberrations in peripheral lymphocytes after metronidazole therapy. Because the classification of metronidazole as <b>genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogen</b> would imply enormous consequences with respect to its application both studies were reinvestigated very thoroughly. The present report describes the reinvestigation of the induction of DNA strand breaks after metronidazole therapy. Each two probes of lymphocytes of metronidazole-treated patients (3 x 500 to 3 x 750 mg/day for 5 - 8 days) were examined separately for the appearance of DNA strand breaks before and after treatment. In total, 400 nuclei were examined per patient. Immediately before the first, and 30 min to 2 h after the last application, 2 x 10 ml blood per patient was sampled, transported to the laboratory at 15 - 200 C to make DNA repair more difficult, and examined within the next 4 - 7 h for DNA strand breaks. At the same time, the individual metronidazole blood plasma levels were measured. In contrast to the published reports, no induction of DNA strand breaks after metronidazole therapy could be observed in the present study. As the applied doses (15 750 mg vs. 4800 mg) and the plasma level (up to 25 ug/ml vs. not measured) of metronidazole were much higher than in the published study, the relevance of the clearly negative result is obvious.

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the present study}} were to investigate the modifying effects of 2 -amino- 3 -methylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoline (IQ), a <b>genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogen</b> produced during cooking of protein-rich foods, and elucidate underlying mechanisms in a two-stage hepatocarcinogenesis mice model. Six-week-old B 6 C 3 F 1 mice were subjected to two-thirds partial hepatectomy {{at the beginning of the}} study, followed by an intraperitoneal injection of diethylni-trosamine on day 1. Starting 1 week later, they were fed diets containing IQ at doses of 30, 100, or 300 ppm for 39 weeks. A dose-dependent trend for increase in eosinophilic altered foci as well as eosinophilic hepatocellular adenomas was observed, along with significant elevation in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in the 100 - and 300 -ppm IQ groups as compared with initiation control group. Furthermore, IQ elevated the protein expression levels of Wnt 1, transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), TGF-...|$|E
40|$|Predictions of {{carcinogenic}} {{activity are}} made for 30 chemicals currently being assessed for rodent carcinogenicity by the U. S. National Toxicology Program. The predictions are based upon the chemical structure, the anticipated or reported mutagenicity, and the reported sub-chronic toxicity of each chemical. It is predicted that 13 chemicals will be noncarcinogenic to rodents, that 7 will be <b>genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens,</b> and that 10 may show some evidence of presumed nongenotoxic rodent carcinogenesis.

40|$|Carcinogens are {{generally}} classified into two Groups: genotoxic and non-genotoxic. As {{the final product}} of <b>genotoxic</b> and non-genotoxic <b>carcinogens</b> is the same, i. e., a clone of genetically altered cells, it could be possible that non-genotoxic <b>carcinogens</b> may yield <b>genotoxic</b> events as a secondary result of cell toxicity having led to mitogenesis/cellular proliferation, or that genetic alterations are induced that are normally negelected in genotoxicity tests. A genetic effect with possbile relevance for the ultimate mechanism of carcinogenicity is the amplification of oncogenes. In the present experiments, amplification of SV 40 -virus DNA in transformed CO 631 -cells has been measured. In this system, two <b>genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> (positive control), two non-carcinogens (negative control), and eight non-genotoxic carcinogens have been tested...|$|R
40|$|The Japanese Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods (JaCVAM) {{sponsored}} {{an international}} prevalidation and validation {{study of the}} in vivo rat alkaline pH comet assay. The main objective {{of the study was}} to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the assay for correctly identifying <b>genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens,</b> as compared with the traditional rat liver unscheduled DNA synthesis assay. Based on existing carcinogenicity and genotoxicity data and chemical class information, 90 chemicals were identified as primary candidates for use in the validation study. From these 90 chemicals, 46 secondary candidates and then 40 final chemicals were selected based on a sufficiency of carcinogenic and genotoxic data, differences in chemical class or genotoxic or carcinogenic mode of action (MOA), availability, price, and ease of handling. These 40 chemicals included 19 <b>genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens,</b> 6 <b>genotoxic</b> non-carcinogens, 7 non-genotoxic carcinogens and 8 non-genotoxic non-carcinogens. “Genotoxicity” was defined as positive in the Ames mutagenicity test or in one of the standard in vivo genotoxicity tests (primarily the erythrocyte micronucleus assay). These chemicals covered various chemicals classes, MOAs, and genotoxicity profiles and were considered to be suitable for the purpose of the validation study. General principles of chemical selection for validation studies are discussed. JRC. I. 5 -Systems Toxicolog...|$|R
