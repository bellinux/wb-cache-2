40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach {{on the design}} of a nonlinear controller to track a reference velocity for an air-breathing supersonic vehicle. The nonlinear control scheme involves an adaptation of propulsive and aerodynamic characteristics in the equations of motion. In this paper, the coefficients of given thrust and drag functions are estimated and they are used to approximate the equations of motion under varying flight conditions. The form of the function of propulsive thrust is extracted from a thrust database which is given by preliminary engine input/output performance analysis. The aerodynamic drag is approximated as a function of angle of attack and fin deflection. The nonlinear controller, designed by using the approximated nonlinear control model equations, provides <b>engine</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> command to follow the desired velocity varying with time.

40|$|Abstract. To use {{dimethyl}} ether as fuel for {{compression ignition engine}} to partially replace fossil oil, this study developed a city bus operating on DME blended with diesel oil. Considering fuel lubricity, viscosity, and calorific value, the optimized mixing ratio for blend fuel was chosen as 20 wt % DME in diesel oil (D 20). Vapor pressure experiments carried out using a highly accurate thermophysical property measurement system showed that the backpressure for blended fuels must not be lower than 0. 6 Mpa to avoid vapor block in the <b>engine</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> system. Moreover, because DME attacks conventional polymer sealants in the fuel system, new sealants made of nitrile rubber (NBR) were used to replace those original one. Experiments demonstrated that these were resistant to swelling by DME. For engine performance, {{it was found that}} fueled with D 20, the rated engine power output can be comparable to that of diesel engine after increasing the supplied fuel amount per cycle, while the overall fuel economy was improved simultaneously. Moreover, for load characteristics at 1800 r/min, over 70 % reduction in smoke and 20 % reduction in nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission were achieved, indicating that using DME blends as fuel can significantly improve the engine emissions...|$|E
40|$|Biodiesel is a {{promising}} non-toxic and biodegradable alternative fuel {{used in the}} transport sector. Nevertheless, the higher viscosity and density of biodiesel poses some acute problems when it is used it in unmodified engine. Taking this into consideration, this study has been focused towards two objectives. The first objective is to identify the effect of temperature on density and viscosity {{for a variety of}} biodiesels and also to develop a correlation between density and viscosity for these biodiesels. The second objective is to investigate and quantify the effects of density and viscosity of the biodiesels and their blends on various components of the <b>engine</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> system such as fuel pump, fuel filters and fuel injector. To achieve first objective density and viscosity of rapeseed oil biodiesel, corn oil biodiesel and waste oil biodiesel blends (0 B, 5 B, 10 B, 20 B, 50 B, 75 B, and 100 B) were tested at different temperatures using EN ISO 3675 : 1998 and EN ISO 3104 : 1996 standards. For both density and viscosity new correlations were developed and compared with published literature. A new correlation between biodiesel density and biodiesel viscosity was also developed. The second objective was achieved by using analytical models showing the effects of density and viscosity on the performance of fuel supply system.

40|$|The {{development}} of electrohydraulic floating-disc valves at the University of Surrey {{started in the}} early 1980 's. The progress {{in the last ten}} years since then has shown that floating-disc valves have the advantages of fast response time, reliable operation, simple configurations, few critical dimensions with no precision sliding surfaces, leading to low cost design and manufacture. They have great potential to fill the gap between conventional solenoid valves and high precision servo valves. However, limitations existed in previous designs hindering further development; for instance relatively large moving mass, low hydraulic stiffness, difficulty of installing springs and poor null position when operating in proportional control mode. The work presented in this thesis concentrates on improving the disc valve electromagnetic characteristics, hydraulic stiffness, electric power consumption, operating reliability, valve size and cost. A novel diaphragm-disc force motor has been successfully developed through this research. The theoretical study and experimental work has shown that the force motor has the features of high spring stiffness, fast response, improved accuracy and linearity, and miniaturised size. By implementing a pair of permanent ring magnets, the diaphragm-disc force motor also has the advantages of lower electric power consumption, dual-lane for fail safety operation, and higher control accuracy. Due to the use of conventional mild steel instead of Remco B soft iron as the coil magnetic conductor material, the valve manufacturing cost has been further reduced. Above all, this novel configuration shows good prospects of competing with the existing torque motor due to its low cost and simple construction. The research described also involves designing and testing two prototype disc valves for specific applications. A single disc pilot valve associated with the diaphragm configuration and permanent magnet arrangement has been built for use in an aviation <b>engine</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> system. It has a dual-lane operating mode with a valve size of 58 x 50 x 50 millimetres, which is the smallest valve yet made in the disc valve family. The initial test results showed that the valve has good linearity and a bandwidth of 60 Hz in a blocked-load condition. Another successfully built valve is an improved version of a position controlled double-disc valve for use in vehicle semi-active suspension systems. It has been demonstrated that using proportional plus derivative electronic network compensation, the valve can operate continually in the whole damper control domain with the characteristics of balanced fluid forces and low electric power consumption...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this work is to test the unscavenged {{prechamber}} ignition system on a 150 kW cogeneration engine feed with biogas. The engine performances in term of fuel conversion efficiency are observed and the reduction potential f the exhaust emissions below the Swiss limit are verified (NOx CO : 400 and 650 mg/Nm 3, 5 % O 2 and 0 % relative humidity); and the non-limited HC emissions too. The interesting variables are the air-fuel ratio, the fuel composition, the compression ratio and the spark-timing. The aim {{of this work}} is to reach at least 36 % in fuel conversion efficiency with exhaust gas emissions lower than the regulations limits without exhaust gas after-treatment. The engine used is a turbocharged spark ignited Liebherr G 926 TI, 10 L, 6 cylinders in line engine fitted with combustion prechambers (with a volume of 3 % of the cylinder volume). As a first step, the <b>engine</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> has been modified to allow the use of natural gas / CO 2 mixtures to simulate biogas. Natural gas tests have been performed with direct ignition and prechamber ignition as references. The same experimental conditions have been applied for the simulated biogas tests. Different spark timing advances have been tested in the configuration with the initial compression ratio of 12, 0. Afterwards new pistons have been developped to reach a compression ratio of 13, 3. Two different CO 2 proportions (20 % and 40 %) {{have been used to}} observe the influence of CO 2 in fuel on the performances. With a compression ratio of 12, 0, 40 % of CO 2 inducee a CO reducion of 15 % and an HC reduction of 8 % for the same NOx emissions with a slight reduction of 1 % in fuel conversion efficiency, compared to pure natural gas. The results for the compression ratio of 13, 3, a spark timing of 8 caBTDC, of 1, 63 and 39, 5 % CO 2 are a fuel conversion efficiency of 38 % and NOx and CO emissions below the swiss limit. Those performances and emissions are compared to the ones obtained for the natural gas with a compression ratio of 12, 0 and prechamber ignition. The use of a compression ratio of 13, 3 instead of 12, 0 allows to balance the loss in fuel conversion efficiency due to the 40 % of CO 2. If the percentage of CO 2 is lower then the efficiency is higher but the CO and HC emissions too. Moreover, it seems better to use a higher compression ratio than a sooner spark timing (see fig. 29, 30, 31). Those tests demonstate that the CO 2 does not modify the combustion process nor the prechamber ignition mode. This study shows that gas engines with unscavenged prechambers could allow a significant boost in energy conversion from biogas while keeping the emissions within the tough Swiss limits...|$|E
