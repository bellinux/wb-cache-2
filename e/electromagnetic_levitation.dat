Although these advancements have enabled electronics to be liberated from wired power sources, the lifetime limitation of batteries has posed significant barriers in some applications, especially in wireless sensor nodes where battery replacement is difficult or dangerous. Present in many electronics 2 ̆ 7 and sensor nodes 2 ̆ 7 environments is a rich source of ambient vibration energy available to be harvested to supplementally recharge the battery.

40|$|Electrical power {{management}} and control systems designed for use in planetary exploration missions and deep space probes require electronics {{that are capable of}} efficient and reliable operation under extreme temperature conditions. Space-based infra-red satellites, all-electric ships, jet engines, <b>electromagnetic</b> launchers, magnetic <b>levitation</b> transport systems, and power facilities are also typical examples where the electronics are expected to be exposed to harsh temperatures and to operate under severe thermal swings. Most commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) devices are not designed to function under such extreme conditions and, therefore, new parts must be developed or the conventional devices need to be modified. For example, spacecraft operating in the cold environment of deep space carry a large number of radioisotope heating units {{in order to maintain the}} surrounding temperature of the on-board electronics at approximately 20 C. At the other end, built-in radiators and coolers render the operation of electronics possible under hot conditions. These thermal measures lead to design complexity, affect development costs, and increase size and weight. Electronics capable of operation at extreme temperatures, thus, will not only tolerate the hostile operational environment, but also make the overall system efficient, more reliable, and less expensive.

40|$|Solidification {{needs an}} {{undercooling}} {{to drive the}} solidification front. If large undercoolings are achieved, metastable solid materials are solidified from the undercooled melt. Containerless processing provides the conditions to achieve large undercoolings since heterogeneous nucleation on container walls is completely avoided. In the present contribution both <b>electromagnetic</b> and electrostatic <b>levitation</b> are applied. The velocity of rapidly advancing dendrites is measured {{as a function of}} undercooling by a High-Speed-Camera. The dendrite growth dynamics is investigated in undercooled melts of intermetallic compounds. The Al 50 Ni 50 alloy is studied with respect to disorder trapping that leads to a disordered superlattice structure if the melt is undercooled beyond a critical undercooling. Disorder trapping is evidenced by in situ energy dispersive diffraction using synchrotron radiation of high intensity to record full diffraction pattern on levitated samples within a short time interval. Experiments on Ni 2 B using different processing techniques of varying the level of convection reveal convection-induced faceting of rapidly growing dendrites. Eventually, the growth velocity is measured in an undercooled melt of glass forming Cu 50 Zr 50 alloy. A maximum in the growth velocity–undercooling relation is proved. This is understood {{by the fact that the}} temperature dependent diffusion coefficient counteracts the thermodynamic driving force for rapid growth if the temperature of the undercooled melt is approaching the temperature regime above the glass transition temperature.

40|$|During {{the past}} decades, the rapid {{development}} of communication systems has extended to {{every aspect of}} modern technology. To better satisfy the need of people {{to interact with the}} world, investigations into the critical communication components mostly within the Radio-Frequency (RF) range have faced a diverse range of operational requirements and environment. The development of reconfigurable devices conforms to these demands with broader applicability. The resonant circuit, consisting of an inductance and capacitance, is fundamental to the design of passive resonant devices. The adjustment of their inherent inductance or capacitance provides a pathway for frequency reconfiguration. The split ring resonator (SRR) is first introduced to generate negative permeability in artificial materials. The physical geometry of a SRR features a gap in a broken conductive ring, and is characterised as a compact sized resonant circuit due to the effective capacitance and inductance occurring on the gap and ring respectively. The integration of SRRs to RF devices has been widely explored, not just to enhance the performance but also enable reconfiguration in some resonant devices. The concept of tuning the intrinsic capacitance or inductance of the SRR has been realised by the addition of active devices such as diodes and MEMS switches. However, interference to the electromagnetic properties due to the additional components and their bias line networks, and tolerance control on the placement of the controlling element is a serious concern. If tuning is required in array structures such as metamaterials, component count, and bias issues are significantly elevated. The aim of this research is to investigate and conceive pneumatic levitation systems as a mean of changing the structural arrangement of SRRs to reconfigure their resonant frequency or other parameters. Rotation, elevation and lateral movement of the SRRs are realised by implementing pneumatic levitation, and the resulting changes in the transmission response are characterised. The resonant frequency of a SRR is dependent on the orientation of the incident <b>electromagnetic</b> waves. Pneumatic <b>levitation</b> is firstly proposed to allow free rotation of a SRR in the azimuthal plane resulting in continuous resonant frequency variations. The inclusion of another identical SRR located below the spinning SRR forms a broad-side coupled architecture. Depending on whether the static SRR is placed parallel or perpendicular to the electric field, the coupled SRRs can achieve 10 % (2. 66 GHz to 2. 39 GHz) or 12 % (2. 67 GHz to 2. 38 GHz) continuous frequency sweep respectively. The levitation platform which holds the SRR is demonstrated to provide different spinning speed profiles and hence frequency sweep rates for the SRR response based on various platform designs. An advanced pneumatic levitation system is devised to allow discrete on-demand resonant frequency control of broad-side coupled SRRs utilizing the rotation angle and separation of SRRs. The pneumatic structure stops the upper SRR at desired locations to achieve an associated resonant frequency response. The coupled SRRs can realise a 35 % tunable frequency range (3. 236 GHz to 2. 11 GHz) over 180 degrees of rotation. The separation of SRRs, driven by the applied pneumatic pressure, demonstrates a tunable frequency range from 0. 7 % to 11. 3 % depending on the set rotation angle. The horizontal arrangement of SRRs introduces another dimension for structure tuning based on the lateral space between two resonators. A pneumatic levitation system which enables the manipulation of the horizontal placement of a SRR leads to a smooth conversion between edge coupled and broad-side coupled SRRs. The transition affects the mutual capacitance of the structure resulting in changes to the transmission response. A 28 % frequency reduction from 3. 2 GHz results during the transition from edge coupled to broad-side coupled mode if two gaps of the SRRs are initially facing each other. When the gaps are facing outwards at the start, a second resonant frequency appears in the examined band and mirrors the shift of the first resonance in the opposite direction, increasing from 3. 2 GHz. The investigation of the lateral control of a SRR using pneumatic levitation is further explored with the integration of an SRR with a CPW and monopole antenna for proof of concept reconfigurable RF device functionality. The integration of pneumatic systems as an approach to tune the structure of SRRs exhibits tremendous potential for the physical modification of coupled SRRs, and possibly also any small resonant devices or components. Both simulation and experiments has demonstrated the possibilities to manipulate frequency shift between 2. 1 GHz to 3. 24 GHz. Furthermore its key advantages are its non-metallic structure which has minimal impact on the resonant properties and incident field, the near frictionless operation, and the control over the degrees of freedom of structural variation...|$|R
