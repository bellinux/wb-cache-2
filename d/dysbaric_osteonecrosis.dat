50|$|Deep diving {{has more}} hazards and greater risk than basic open water diving. Nitrogen narcosis, the “narks” or “rapture of the deep”, starts with {{feelings}} of euphoria and over-confidence but then leads to numbness and memory impairment similar to alcohol intoxication. Decompression sickness, or the “bends”, can happen if a diver ascends too fast, when excess inert gas leaves solution in the blood and tissues and forms bubbles. These bubbles produce mechanical and biochemical effects {{that lead to the}} condition. The onset of symptoms depends on the severity of the tissue gas loading and may develop during ascent in severe cases, but is frequently delayed until after reaching the surface. Bone degeneration (<b>dysbaric</b> <b>osteonecrosis)</b> is caused by the bubbles forming inside the bones; most commonly the upper arm and the thighs. Deep diving involves a much greater danger of all of these, and presents the additional risk of oxygen toxicity, which may lead to a convulsion underwater. Very deep diving using a helium-oxygen mixture (heliox) carries a risk of high-pressure nervous syndrome. Coping with the physical and physiological stresses of deep diving requires good physical conditioning.|$|E
40|$|Japanese diving {{fishermen}} {{are known}} to have a high prevalence of <b>dysbaric</b> <b>osteonecrosis.</b> Their typical dive practices are characterized by long exposure to high pressure and by repetitive diving. The etiology of <b>dysbaric</b> <b>osteonecrosis</b> still remains controversial. Because the development of <b>dysbaric</b> <b>osteonecrosis</b> may occur silently, the diver may be unaware of the actual ischemic event. Moreover, key etiologic evidence is often lost before the diver is examined. The early stage of <b>dysbaric</b> <b>osteonecrosis</b> was evaluated in four autopsy cases of divers who died of acute decompression sickness. Hypercoagulability of blood was present in these cases. Hypercoagulability of blood has also been observed in experimental rats after decompression. <b>Dysbaric</b> <b>osteonecrosis</b> has been experimentally induced in six sheep at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. These findings are reviewed by comparing <b>dysbaric</b> <b>osteonecrosis</b> in both divers and experimental animals.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>dysbaric</b> <b>osteonecrosis</b> in U. S. Navy divers and to develop epidemiological data for insight into those aspects of the hyperbaric environment {{that contribute to the}} ultimate occurrence of <b>dysbaric</b> <b>osteonecrosis.</b> FINDINGS Twelve juxta-articular lesions have been identified among 21 lesions observed in fifteen radiologically positive cases of <b>dysbaric</b> <b>osteonecrosis</b> observed in 611 non-randomly selected U.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Dysbaric</b> <b>osteonecrosis</b> {{is a rare}} {{illness in}} {{professional}} divers and compressed-air workers. The correlation between <b>dysbaric</b> <b>osteonecrosis</b> and previous decompression sickness with osteoarthromuscular pain (type 1 decompression sickness) remains a controversial subject. The probability for ischemic lesions detected with MRI to turn into osteonecrosis after decompression sickness is still not established. EXEGESIS: The authors report {{the case of a}} military diver declared definitely medically unfit to dive after the occurrence of advanced <b>dysbaric</b> <b>osteonecrosis</b> of the shoulder, eight months after decompression sickness treated with hyperbaric oxygen, in the same area. A close link between those two events and the requirement for monitoring the follow-up of acute type 1 decompression sickness are discussed. CONCLUSION: Every decompression sickness with osteoarthromuscular pain should be early examined with MRI in order to screen osteomedullar damages liable to worse with diving and change subsequently in bone necrosis...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} results of X-ray and CT scan for <b>dysbaric</b> <b>osteonecrosis</b> in Chinese divers. Methods: Both shoulders, hips and knees of 66 {{asymptomatic}} divers with diving duration {{of more than one}} year were examined by X-ray and CT scan. Results: The most frequent locations of <b>dysbaric</b> <b>osteonecrosis</b> were the upper femurs, followed by the upper humerus, lower femurs and upper tibias, and the most frequent radiographic lesions were calcification spots and cystic changes. Of the lesions detected, 38 % (27 / 71) and 42 % (95 / 229) were juxta-articular of the femoral and humeral heads by X-ray and CT respectively. The detection rates of dysbaric necrosis (juxta- and/or other lesions) of X-ray and CT scan were 42. 4 % (95 % confidence interval: 30. 5 %- 54. 3 %) and 81. 8 % (95 % CI: 72. 4 %- 91. 2 %) respectively (p< 0. 05). If CT scan was used as the gold standard, the sensitivity of X-ray was 100 % and the specificity was 31. 6 %. Conclusion: CT scan showed a higher detection rate of dysbaric necrosis than X-ray.

40|$|In Hong Kong, {{the use of}} {{compressed}} air {{in the construction of}} underground tunnels for its Mass Transit Railway started in 1975 and ended in 1985.

The major disqualifying conditions were lung and cardiovascular diseases. Chest X-ray was found to be the most useful procedure since it revealed 55 per cent of the total disqualifying conditions. Of the 1549 men declared fit for employment, 130 (8 - 4 per cent) were later declared unfit to continue, mainly because of their susceptibility to attacks of bends.

40|$|In {{the largest}} {{compressed}} air tunnelling project using the Blackpool Decompression Tables in Hong Kong, 912 men had radiological examination of major joints and 12 definite and 30 suspected cases of <b>dysbaric</b> <b>osteonecrosis</b> were detected by the compressed air physician.

Logistic regression analysis showed that the number of bends ever experienced, number of hours worked in the present contract, age and obesity were important independent risk factors.

40|$|Experimental {{data that}} in an acute stage of {{decompression}} sickness (DCS) marked and extensive formation of gaseous bubbles in the sinusoids and extravascular spaces with frequent arterial and arteriolar collapse occurred in the bone marrow of the femora of rabbits is presented. Discussing the related evidence linking these observations with <b>dysbaric</b> <b>osteonecrosis</b> (DON) in divers and caisson workers, intravascular and extravascular bubble formation may cause marked elevation of intraosseous pressure resulting in arterial collapse especially of the ""watershed zones"" which include the weight-bearing juxta-articular area and distal shaft area of the bone marrow of humanfemur. Disturbance in the venous return from the bone marrow due to extensive bubble embolization of the sinusoids should accentuate the elevation of the intraosseous pressure.

40|$|Diving and {{hyperbaric}} {{exposure is}} associated with a number of well recognised acute illnesses or injuries, including decompression illness (DCI), gas embolism and barotrauma. Recovery depends on the severity and nature of the diving incident, but in many cases it is complete. What remains less certain, however, are the possible long term health effects of diving, particularly {{in the absence of an}} injury. <b>Dysbaric</b> <b>osteonecrosis</b> has been associated with diving and is now a notifiable industrial disease in divers. Other aspects of health, however, have raised concern in divers but have not been conclusively associated with a career in diving, with any impact on quality of life or with a disease state. These include neurological abnormalities, lung function changes and inner ear damage. The aim of the ELTHI diving study (Examination of Long Term Health Impact of diving) was to investigate the possible long term health effects of diving at work. Furthermore, the significance of health complaints was assessed in terms of health related quality of life, as well as by reference to population norms. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent dogma {{suggested}} that marine mammals {{are not at}} risk of decompression sickness (DCS) due {{to a number of}} evolutionary adaptations. Several proposed adaptations exist. Lung compression and alveolar collapse that terminate gas exchange before a depth is reached where supersaturation is significant and bradycardia with peripheral vasoconstriction affecting the distribution, and dynamics of blood and tissue nitrogen levels. Published accounts of gas and fat emboli and <b>dysbaric</b> <b>osteonecrosis</b> in marine mammals and theoretical modeling have challenged this view-point, suggesting that decompression-like symptoms may occur under certain circumstances, contrary to common belief. Diagnostic imaging modalities are invaluable tools for the non-invasive examination of animals for evidence of gas and have been used to demonstrate the presence of incidental decompression-related renal gas accumulations in some stranded cetaceans. Diagnostic imaging has also contributed to the recognition of clinically significant gas accumulations in live and dead cetaceans and pinnipeds. Understanding the appropriate application and limitations of the available imaging modalities is important for accurate interpretation of results. The presence of gas may be incidental and must be interpreted cautiously alongside all other available data including clinical examination, clinical laboratory testing, gas analysis, necropsy examination and histology results...|$|E
