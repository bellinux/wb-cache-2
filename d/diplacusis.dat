50|$|<b>Diplacusis,</b> {{also known}} as <b>diplacusis</b> binauralis or inter aural pitch {{difference}} (IPD) {{is a type of}} hearing disorder that is the perception of a single auditory stimulus as two separate sounds which may differ in pitch or in time. It is typically (though not exclusively) experienced as a secondary symptom of sensorineural hearing loss, although not all patients with sensory neural hearing loss may experience <b>diplacusis</b> or tinnitus. Onset is usually spontaneous and can occur at the time of an acoustic trauma or {{in the midst of an}} ear infection. Sufferers may experience the effect permanently, or it may resolve on its own. Treatment includes a full medical examination as well as an audiological examination that may explain the nature of the problem. If needed, amplification may relieve the symptoms of <b>diplacusis.</b> Therapy in helping the patient understand the cause of the symptom and tinnitus retraining may provide some relief. In at least some cases, amplification makes no difference and there is no treatment other than waiting for natural resolution.|$|E
50|$|Bilateral SNHL gives less <b>diplacusis,</b> but pitch distortions may persist. This {{may cause}} {{problems}} {{with music and}} speech understanding.|$|E
50|$|Place Theory {{posits that}} the cause is looking for {{the edge of the}} wave for the pitch and could explain <b>diplacusis</b> as a small {{differences}} between the two cochleas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diplacusis</b> {{may also}} occur {{if for some}} reason the density of the fluid in the cochlea is altered. To a good approximation, the {{resonant}} frequency of a given hair will vary inversely as the square root of density, so that for example the hairs associated with middle C will shift their resonance to C# if the fluid density decreases by about 12%. Thus the C# will be perceived by the brain as a C natural. In this hypothesis, which may explain some cases of <b>diplacusis,</b> the entire spectrum of tones is shifted by the same amount.|$|E
5000|$|If one ear has normal {{thresholds}} {{and one has}} SNHL (a unilateral loss), {{there is}} a lot of <b>diplacusis.</b> As much as 15 - 20% (for example 200 Hz one ear => 240 Hz in the other). Hard to match because the SNHL ear hears it [...] "fuzzily".|$|E
5000|$|Temporal Theory {{posits that}} the cause is from looking at the phase locking to tell what the pitch is. This theory {{has a hard time}} {{explaining}} <b>diplacusis.</b> There are some examples of pitch which don’t have an [...] "edge" [...] on the basilar membrane, which this would account for—i.e. white noise, clicks, etc.|$|E
50|$|Chambers, Moss, and Mattingley {{believe that}} the {{illusion}} {{is caused by a}} combination of harmonic fusion and binaural <b>diplacusis,</b> a condition in which a pitch is perceived slightly differently between ears. In experiments employing a few subjects, none reported the percept most commonly obtained by Deutsch’s subjects. This does not necessarily conflict with other studies, as the number of subjects used in this experiment was small and there are individual differences in perception of the illusion. The authors also argued that experiments conducted by others did not clarify whether the high tone and low tones were perceived as being an octave apart. They claimed, therefore, that their results were not consistent with those of Deutsch in relation to hand dominance and ear dominance versus location of pitch.|$|E
5000|$|These criticisms were rebutted in two articles. Deutsch (2004a) used a new procedure, which {{provided}} more explicit {{documentation of the}} octave illusion; here musically trained subjects notated precisely what they heard. The experiment confirmed that subjects, on listening to the illusion, perceive an octave difference between the ears. This result cannot be explained by <b>diplacusis,</b> which refers to a difference of {{a fraction of a}} semitone between the ears. The article also documented that Chambers et al. used problematic procedures. In a further article, Deutsch (2004b) [...] showed that Chambers et al. made inappropriate comparisons with other phenomena of sound perception, and failed to consider several key findings that support Deutsch’s model. In addition, the octave illusion, in which an octave difference between the ears is perceived, has been replicated in several other laboratories. For example, Oehler and Reuter recently replicated the handedness correlate in a study of 174 subjects Lamminmaki and Hari (2000) and Lamminmaki et al. (2012) in MEG studies provide an explanation of the illusion at the neurophysiological level that is in accordance with Deutsch’s two-channel model.|$|E
40|$|The octave {{illusion}} (D. Deutsch, 1974) {{occurs when}} 2 tones separated by an octave are alternated repeatedly, such {{that when the}} right ear receives the high tone, the left ear receives the low tone, and vice versa. Most subjects in the original study reported hearing a single tone that alternated from ear to ear, whose pitch also alternated from octave to octave, and D. Deutsch (1975 a) proposed an explanation in terms of separate what and where auditory pathways. C. D. Chambers, J. B. Mattingley, and S. A. Moss (2002) argued that the perceived pitch difference generally corresponds more to a semitone and proposed an alternative explanation in terms of <b>diplacusis.</b> This article argues that Chambers et al. used problematic procedures and reports a new experiment on the octave illusion. The findings confirm that an octave difference is generally perceived, and they agree with the model of Deutsch (1975 a) but are at variance with the <b>diplacusis</b> hypothesis. I thank Trevor Henthorn for his valuable assistance in set-ting up the instrumentation for the experiment. Correspondence concerning this article shuld b...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: An {{investigation}} of the hearing status of musicians of professional symphony orchestras. Main questions are: (1) Should musicians {{be treated as a}} special group with regard to hearing, noise, and noise related hearing problems (2) Do patterns of hearing damage differ for different instrument types (3) Do OAE have an added value in the diagnosis of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) in musicians. METHODS: 241 professional musicians, aged between 23 - 64 participated. A brief medical history and the subjective judgment of their hearing and hearing problems were assessed. Musicians were subjected to an extensive audiological test battery, which contained testing of audiometric thresholds, loudness perception, <b>diplacusis,</b> tinnitus, speech perception in noise, and otoacoustic emissions. RESULTS: Most musicians could be categorized as normal hearing, but their audiograms show notches at 6 kHz, a frequency that is associated with NIHL. Musicians often complained about tinnitus and hyperacusis, while <b>diplacusis</b> was generally not reported as a problem. Tinnitus was most often localized utmost left and this could not be related to the instrument. It was usually perceived in high frequency areas, associated with NIHL. In general, musicians scored very well on the speech-in-noise test. The results of the loudness perception test were within normal limits. Otoacoustic emissions were more intense with better pure-tone thresholds, but due to large individual differences it can still not be used as an objective test for early detection of NIHL. CONCLUSIONS: Musicians show more noise induced hearing loss than could be expected on the basis of age and gender. Other indicators, such as complaints and prevalence of tinnitus, complaints about hyperacusis and prevalence of <b>diplacusis</b> suggest that musicians' ears are at risk. Continuing education about the risks of intensive sound exposure to musicians, with the emphasis on the possible development of tinnitus and hyperacusis and the need for good hearing protection is warrante...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to assess hearing and hearing {{disorders}} among classical and rock/jazz musicians. Pure tone audiometry was performed in 140 classical and 139 rock/jazz musicians. The rock/jazz musicians answered a questionnaire concerning hearing disorders (hearing loss, tinnitus, hyperacusis, distortion, <b>diplacusis)</b> and psycho-social exposure (demands, control, support, stress and energy). All results were compared to age appropriate reference materials. The results showed overall well-preserved hearing thresholds in both classical and rock/jazz musicians, considering the periodically high sound levels exposure. The female musicians were shown to have significantly better hearing thresholds in the high frequency area than the male musicians. Among classical musicians, the brass players displayed slightly worse hearing thresholds than the other musicians. Rock/jazz musicians showed slight worse hearing thresholds as compared to classical musicians. Hearing thresholds showed a notch configuration indicating the inclusion of high sound levels in both classical and rock/jazz musicians. When assessing hearing disorders (hearing loss, tinnitus, hyperacusis, distortion, <b>diplacusis)</b> {{a large number of}} rock/jazz musicians were shown to suffer from different hearing disorders (74 %). Hearing loss, tinnitus and hyperacusis were the most common disorders and found to be significantly more frequent in comparison with different reference populations. A 16 years follow-up study was done in classical musicians to evaluate the risk of progressive hearing loss. Males showed a slightly more pronounced, although not significant, hearing reduction in the high frequency region and a higher threshold distribution within the 90 th percentile than the females. No extended negative progress of the pure tone hearing threshold values was found in spite of the continued 16 years of musical noise exposure. Psychosocial exposure (demand, control and support) as measured in the 139 rock/jazz musicians showed no convincing evidence for associations between psychosocial factors at work and hearing disorders in general. The rock/jazz musicians reported low stress (negative valued) and high degree of energy (positive valued) and on the average, the rock/jazz musicians reported higher control, lower stress and higher energy than did a reference material of white-collar workers. Random sound level measurements during rock/jazz performances showed sound levels well exceeding recommended maximum levels. Musicians are dependent on a very well functioning auditory system. A sensorineural or cochlear hearing loss may be devastating, creating difficulties with sound recognition, localisation, and reduced auditory dynamic range and loudness recruitment. It may further imply difficulties with perception of pitch, loudness, duration and timbre. Tinnitus, hyperacusis, distortion and <b>diplacusis</b> are among musicians considered to be an even greater handicap than a moderate high tone loss. Thus it is vital that hearing disorders among musicians include tinnitus, hyperacusis, distortion and <b>diplacusis...</b>|$|E
40|$|The octave {{illusion}} {{occurs when}} each ear receives {{a sequence of}} tones alternating by I octave but with {{the high and low}} tones in different ears. Most listeners perceive these stimuli as a high pitch in one ear alternating with a low pitch in the other ear. D. Deutsch and P. L. Roll (1976) interpreted this phenomenon as evidence for a what-where division of auditory processing caused by sequential interactions between the tones. They argued that the pitch follows the frequency presented to the dominant ear but is lateralized toward the higher frequency component. This model was examined in 4 experiments. Results indicate that the perceived pitch approximates the fundamental frequency and that the illusion does not depend on sequential interactions. The octave illusion may arise from an interaction between dichotic fusion and binaural <b>diplacusis</b> rather than from suppression as proposed by Deutsch...|$|E
40|$|It’s a noisy world, {{and hearing}} damage from loud sound affects {{millions}} of people. Noise‑induced hearing loss (NIHL) and associated disorders of tinnitus, hyperacusis and <b>diplacusis</b> are all irreversible. This is a tragedy, considering that these often debilitating conditions are preventable. The keys to prevention are {{in understanding the}} risks and consistently acting to minimize the risks. NEW EVIDENCE FOR URGENCY NIHL and associated disorders (which, for simplification, {{will be included in}} the acronym “NIHL”) are caused by overexposure: listening to sound that’s too loud, for too long. NIHL can occur from a single activity such as an explosion or a loud concert, but it usually occurs gradually over many years. Decades of data have shown that noise‑related shifts in hearing appeared to be temporary, a phenomenon known as temporary threshold shift (TTS). With TTS, hearing thresholds typically recover to pre‑noise exposure levels after a period of auditory quiet. Because of this recovery, many of us assumed that the structure and function of the auditory system was affected only temporarily by noise, returning to normal (or pre‑exposure) levels after a period of quiet. We believed that permanen...|$|E
40|$|The octave or Deutsch {{illusion}} {{occurs when}} two tones, separated by about one octave, are presented simultaneously but alternating between ears, such {{that when the}} low tone is presented to the left ear the high tone is presented to the right ear and vice versa. Most subjects hear a single tone that alternates both between ears and in pitch; i. e., they hear a low pitched tone in one ear alternating with a high pitched tone in the other ear. The present study examined whether the illusion can be elicited by aperiodic signals consisting of low-frequency band-pass filtered noises with overlapping spectra. The amount of spectral overlap was held constant, but the high- and low-frequency content of the signals was systematically varied. The majority of subjects perceived an auditory illusion {{in terms of a}} dominant ear for pitch and lateralization by frequency, as proposed by Deutsch [(1975 a) Sci. Am. 233, 92 - 104]. Furthermore, the salience of the illusion increased as the high frequency of the content in the signal increased. Since no harmonics were present in the stimuli, {{it is highly unlikely that}} this illusion is perceived on the basis of binaural <b>diplacusis</b> or harmonic binaural fusion...|$|E
40|$|Noise-induced {{hearing loss}} is an {{important}} public health issue, especially among musicians who are, {{more than any other}} occupation, dependent on their hearing. For them, hearing impairment is due to too loud music, the effect of which, if exceeding the limit depending on the individual sensitivity of one’s ear, can be compared with theeffect of noise on the ear. Risk factors for its development are: the type of musical instrument and sound character, the way of playing, music genre or composition, duration of exposure to loud music, sound source and its distance from the ear, intervals of acoustic stimuli, individual factors and the musician’s position in the orchestra. Hearing impairment is greater at higher frequencies; in pure tone audiogram it is shown as notches between 3000 and 6000 Hz and is most frequent in the wind and brass section. Hearing loss is greater among violinists and typically affects the left ear owing to the sound source proximity and their position in the orchestra. The most common health problems take the form of <b>diplacusis,</b> algiacusis and tinnitus, as exposure to the loud acoustic stimulus above 90 dB(A) cause damage to the inner ear, the so-called acoustic trauma. Use of personal protective equipment among musicians is low especially because of too much high-frequency attenuation and occlusion effect...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{recognized}} that professional musicians {{are at risk}} of hearing damage due to the exposure to high sound pressure levels during music playing. However, {{it is important to recognize}} that the musicians’ exposure may start early in the course of their training as students in the classroom and at home. Studies regarding sound exposure of music students and their hearing disorders are scarce and do not take into account important influencing variables. Therefore, this study aimed to describe sound level exposures of music students at different music styles, classes, and according to the instrument played. Further, this investigation attempted to analyze the perceptions of students in relation to exposure to loud music and consequent health risks, as well as to characterize preventive behaviors. The results showed that music students are exposed to high sound levels in the course of their academic activity. This exposure is potentiated by practice outside the school and other external activities. Differences were found between music style, instruments, and classes. Tinnitus, hyperacusis, <b>diplacusis,</b> and sound distortion were reported by the students. However, students were not entirely aware of the health risks related to exposure to high sound pressure levels. These findings reflect the importance of starting intervention in relation to noise risk reduction at an early stage, when musicians are commencing their activity as students...|$|E
40|$|Noise {{is usually}} defined either {{unwanted}} sound or sound that is {{harmful to the}} hearing. Earlier {{studies have shown that}} musicians are exposed to sound levels that can be harmful to hearing, and thus music can be considered as noise. Studies have also shown that musicians have hearing problems due to prolonged music exposure. This is also the case among classical musicians. According to the new noise directive, hearing conservation programs directed to entertainment sector are needed. However the needs and attitudes of the classical music players are not understood in many perspectives. In this study, the total annual noise exposure including personal rehearsals has been measured and evaluated for the first time. The problems experienced with hearing protective devices, hearing symptoms (self-evaluated hearing loss, tinnitus, hyperacusis and <b>diplacusis),</b> and stress and their interaction were identified and quantified in two countries among large symphony orchestras. The results showed that the use of a hearing protective device was poor, especially in personal rehearsals. The musicians with hearing loss used more often a hearing protective device. All hearing symptoms were related to stress and reduced work satisfaction. Hearing loss was measured with audiometer among a volunteer group. The hearing loss correlated with music exposure but was smaller than predicted by the standard ISO 1999 - 1990. Room acoustics was improved in a project involving small classrooms for music students. The classrooms correspond to personal rehearsal facilities for musicians. The improvement in room acoustics was minor, but had a beneficial effect on job satisfaction. The thesis provides means to implement personal protection, technical means and training in hearing conservation programs for classical music players...|$|E
40|$|Binaural pitch <b>diplacusis</b> {{refers to}} a perceptual anomaly whereby the same sound is {{perceived}} as having a different pitch depending on whether it {{is presented in the}} left or the right ear. Results in the literature suggest that this phenomenon is more prevalent, and larger, in individuals with asymmetric hearing loss than in individuals with symmetric hearing. However, because studies devoted to this effect have thus far involved small samples, the prevalence of the effect, and its relationship with interaural asymmetries in hearing thresholds, remain unclear. In this study, psychometric functions for interaural pitch comparisons were measured in 55 subjects, including 12 normal-hearing and 43 hearing-impaired participants. Statistically significant pitch differences between the left and right ears were observed in normal-hearing participants, but the effect was usually small (less than 1. 5 / 16 octave, or about 7 %). For the hearing-impaired participants, statistically significant interaural pitch differences were found in about three-quarters of the cases. Moreover, for about half of these participants, the difference exceeded 1. 5 / 16 octaves and, in some participants, was as large as or larger than 1 / 4 octave. This was the case even for the lowest frequency tested, 500 Hz. The pitch differences were weakly, but significantly, correlated with the difference in hearing thresholds between the two ears, such that larger threshold asymmetries were statistically associated with larger pitch differences. For {{the vast majority of the}} hearing-impaired participants, the direction of the pitch differences was such that pitch was perceived as higher on the side with the higher (i. e., 'worse') hearing thresholds than on the opposite side. These findings are difficult to reconcile with purely temporal models of pitch perception, but may be accounted for by place-based or spectrotemporal models...|$|E
40|$|Different {{theories}} of hearing {{that have been}} proposed until now {{are not in a}} position to explain satisfactorily the physical properties and the operation of the ear. The purpose, the interaction of the different parts, and the performance of the many parts of the inner ear are rather obscure. This investigation has therefore, been carried out to establish (i) an interaction of all parts of the ear, and (ii) to obtain the accurate dimensions of the inner ear. This is necessary to develop a complete picture of the system. If this is done then the physical performance of the ear can be explained more explicitly. Experiments described herein have been carried out on the inner ear system of anoa bubalis (water buffalo) as found in Pakistan. The inner ear of this animal is rather similar to that of man. On the basis of experiments performed, a new theory has been developed and may be described as a cybernetic model. The theory as presented is found to answer satisfactorily the following points: (i) Logic of design of all parts of the ear system, (ii) their function and performance, (iii) shape of resonance curves observed by Bekesy, (iv) frequency selectivity of ear, (v) area of maximum stimulus, (vi) sensitivity to frequency shift, (vii) similarities in audiograms of related persons, (viii) differences in tuning of the two ears (<b>diplacusis</b> binauralis), (ix) intensity sensitivity of ear as function of frequency, (x) influence of age on upper frequency limit, (xi) influence of age on sensitivity of ear, (xii) effects of a localized lesion of the basilar membrane, (xiii) sufficiency of deflections to cause a sensation, (xiv) masking, (xv) width of Critical band of masking, (xvi) width of band of beats, (xviii) acoustic trauma including width of damaged band, transverse location of damage, longitudinal location of damage, and (xix) comparison to vestibular apparatus.
