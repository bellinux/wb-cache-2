For simplicity, in this first investigation we have considered the cations and anions of the same size. We have calculated the corresponding Values of the double layer capacitance {{as a function of}} the electrode potential and compared the results with existing theories. We have found that the capacitance curve does not follow the U-shape of the Gouy-Chapman theory, but has a bell-shape in agreement with the mean-field theory that takes into account the effect of limited maximum packing of ions. The wings of capacitance decrease inversely proportional to the square root of the electrode potential, as prescribed by the mean-field theory and the charge conservation law at large <b>electrode</b> <b>polarizations.</b> We have found, however, that the mean-field theory does not quantitatively reproduce the simulation results at small electrode potentials, having detected their remarkable over-screening effects (ionic correlations). The plots for the distributions of ions near the electrode at different electrode charges show that for the considered system, unlike it is often assumed, the double layer is not one layer thick. The overscreening effects, dominating near the potential of zero charge (p. z. c.). are suppressed by the high <b>electrode</b> <b>polarizations,</b> following the onset of the so-called 'lattice saturation effect'. The maximum of the capacitance coincides with the p. z. c., but it is true only for this 'symmetric' system.

40|$|AbstractAmong {{the various}} {{label-free}} methods for monitoring biomolecular interactions, capacitive sensors stand out {{due to their}} simple instrumentation and compatibility with multiplex formats. However, <b>electrode</b> <b>polarization</b> due to ion gradient formation and noise from solution conductance limited early dielectric spectroscopic measurements to high frequencies only, which in turn limited their sensitivity to biomolecular interactions, as the applied excitation signals were too fast for the charged macromolecules to respond. To minimize <b>electrode</b> <b>polarization</b> effects, capacitive sensors with 20 nm electrode separation were fabricated using silicon dioxide sacrificial layer techniques. The nanoscale separation of the capacitive electrodes in the sensor results in an enhanced overlapping of electrical double layers, and apparently a more ordered “ice-like” water structure.
