30|$|The {{accurate}} <b>inventory</b> <b>reconciliation</b> model {{plays an}} important role in improving the capacity of fault diagnosis and reducing the misdiagnosis rate as well as omissive judgement rate of fault diagnosis during storage and transportation process (Chen et al. 2010; United States Environmental Protection Agency 1995). The error of <b>inventory</b> <b>reconciliation</b> is related to source measurements, terminal measurements and process loss. It obeys the normal distribution with zero mean in theory. Different measurement systems have unlike instruments based on various principles. Unlike instruments have different accuracy, nonlinear, zero drift and other characteristics. These characteristics are affected by internal and external environment and so on. Under the influence of different measurement methods between sources and terminals as well as the impact of process technology, process parameters, process loss and environmental changes, the error of <b>inventory</b> <b>reconciliation</b> obeys the normal distribution that the mean is not zero actually. It is difficult to establish a precise error prediction model of <b>inventory</b> <b>reconciliation</b> using first principles.|$|E
30|$|Aiming at {{the error}} of <b>inventory</b> <b>reconciliation</b> caused by {{different}} metering systems, the error prediction method of <b>inventory</b> <b>reconciliation</b> during storage and transportation process based on PLS and MFOA-LSSVM is proposed in the paper. This method uses PLS to achieve the goal of key factors feature extraction for <b>inventory</b> <b>reconciliation</b> model equations firstly. Then, {{in order to avoid}} falling into local optimum, LSSVM optimized by MFOA is adopted for modeling. Finally, the validity of the method is verified by the experiment of oil storage and transportation process on the advanced process control experimental platform. In order to simplify the calculation, the error prediction model is established when the pump frequency is 42.5  Hz.|$|E
30|$|Process {{optimization}} and {{fault diagnosis}} technology, which {{is represented by}} production process monitoring, design and production condition adjustment, {{play an important role}} in the modern petroleum industry. Accurate <b>inventory</b> <b>reconciliation</b> model is the basis of process optimization and fault diagnosis. To eliminate the impact of the <b>inventory</b> <b>reconciliation</b> error caused by different metering systems, the error prediction method of <b>inventory</b> <b>reconciliation</b> during storage and transportation process based on partial least squares (PLS) and least squares support vector machine optimized by modified fruit fly optimization algorithm (MFOA-LSSVM) is proposed. The general error prediction method flow of <b>inventory</b> <b>reconciliation</b> is provided. The principles of PLS and MFOA-LSSVM are elaborated in detail. Firstly, the algorithm of PLS is used to exclude the interference of unrelated factors and extract the most relevant factors that influence the error of <b>inventory</b> <b>reconciliation.</b> Then the modified three-dimensional fruit fly optimization algorithm with diminishing steps as well as a good global search capability is adopted to select the LSSVM model parameters and build the error prediction model. Finally, the sample data were revised by using the predictive value to verify the validity of the proposed method. The experimental modeling was carried out by PLS and MFOA-LSSVM. Compared with other forecasting methods, this method not only has the advantage of faster calculations, but also can well predict the error of reconciliation.|$|E
30|$|On {{the basis}} of {{instrument}} error prediction methods, use modular least squares support vector machines to predict the error of <b>inventory</b> <b>reconciliation</b> and eliminate it subsequently. On the one hand, the feature extraction has been implemented for the independent variables by partial least squares regression. On the other hand, the problems of large computation and low accuracy for error prediction have been solved by using the modified fruit fly algorithm to optimize parameters of least squares support vector machine. Compared with other three different prediction methods, experiments show that the method of PLS and MFOA-LSSVM can predict the error of <b>inventory</b> <b>reconciliation</b> model effectively.|$|E
30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Eq. (17), factors that affect the error of <b>inventory</b> <b>reconciliation</b> model include flow error, level error and {{integration}} time. In addition, the medium temperature, ambient temperature and pump frequency will influence the error by affecting factors v and h.|$|E
30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Fig.  4, the error varies with {{different}} level at the same frequency. At the same level, there are big differences for the model error between different frequencies. These results show that the error of <b>inventory</b> <b>reconciliation</b> model really exists and is related to pump frequency, media velocity and the media level. As shown in Fig.  5, the error varies with different medium temperature and ambient temperature too.|$|E
30|$|The {{predictive}} {{value of these}} four methods {{may be used to}} correct model error. Through the above comparison, these four methods can eliminate the systematic error influence on <b>inventory</b> <b>reconciliation</b> model to some extent, but the performance of various methods is somewhat different. Overall, the model of LSSVM optimized by fruit fly algorithm has a small error with respect to particle swarm optimization. Because of excluding the effects of noise and resolving the multicollinearity among input variables, the method with feature extraction by using partial least squares has some features compared to other methods, such as the less time spent and higher accuracy. The method of PSO-LSSVM consumed longest time with the biggest errors in predicting the error of <b>inventory</b> <b>reconciliation</b> model. The PLS and MFOA-LSSVM method used herein not only shorten the simulation time and improve the accuracy, but also their relative error distribution is better than other methods. It improved 1.48, 0.93 and 2.91 % than other three methods in the aspects of RMSE, MAE and E ave, respectively. The maximum value of modeling time saved by it could reach up to 17.6 %.|$|E
30|$|First of all, {{analyze the}} source and {{terminal}} metering system. Establish the formula of <b>inventory</b> <b>reconciliation</b> error under the dynamic steady condition during storage and transportation process. Collect the experimental data of key factors. Then, eliminate gross error in data by using 3 σ rule. Normalize it subsequently, so that the trained LSSVM model immune to gross error and different dimensions. Then, extract principal components {{of the independent variables}} which relevant to dependent variables by PLS. At the same time, redundant or irrelevant data are eliminated and the amount of input data is reduced. Hereafter, optimize the model of LSSVM to find out the optimum value of parameters by using training data and MFOA. Establish the prediction model of LSSVM. Finally, input prediction model built before with the test data to obtain the prediction error.|$|E
