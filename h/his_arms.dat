5|$|As Bryan spoke {{his final}} sentence, recalling the Crucifixion of Jesus, {{he placed his}} hands to his temples, fingers {{extended}}; with the final words, he extended <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> to his sides straight out to his body and held that pose for about five seconds as if offering himself as sacrifice for the cause, as the audience watched in dead silence. He then lowered them, descended from the podium, and began to head back to his seat as the stillness held.|$|E
5000|$|Now the sloppy {{reading of}} the {{sentence}} arises, where John scratched <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> (John’s arm) and Bob scratched <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> (Bob’s arm).

5|$|Blythe, who is nearsighted, {{took off}} his glasses before {{entering}} the stage, which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half-blind. Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage. One of the fans, who was identified as Milan Pořádek by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security. Blythe testified that during the first attempt, Pořádek rushed the stage and started waving <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> before stage diving. The second time, he tried to put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> around Blythe {{in an attempt to}} hug him. Blythe, who according to his own words perceived this as a danger, caught Pořádek's collar, pushed him on the ground, knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop. He then led the fan by his hair {{to the edge of the}} stage, where the fan jumped off. It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back. Blythe further said that he saw Pořádek trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security.|$|E

The Curtiss people derisively suggested that if someone jumped {{in the air and}} waved <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> the Wrights would sue.|$|E
5|$|Dokeianos re-appears in 1050, when he {{held the}} titles of patrikios and vestarches, {{as part of an}} {{imperial}} expedition against the Pechenegs who raided Thrace.

As he was brought before the Pecheneg leader, however, Dokeianos seized a sword from one of his guards and slashed at the leader, cutting off one of <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> whereupon the enraged Pechenegs killed him and, according to Michael Attaleiates, opened his belly, cut off <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and legs and placed them in it.|$|E
