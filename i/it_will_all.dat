I'm actually not familiar with her work, and I told her this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. I go by other things. I go by scripts. I go with what I think I can do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E
25|$|In the woods, David, Hook and Robin {{are ready}} to confront Arthur at his tent, and they brought weapons along, just in case. Robin and Hook secure the area while David goes inside the tent. As Arthur greets David cordially, David demands to know why Arthur lied and tried to burn the Crimson Crown, and tells him about they message they {{received}} from Merlin, which detailed that only Nimue could destroy that Darkness. David demands to know who Nimue is and points his gun at Arthur. Arthur, however, decides to throw the threesome off with a table, then escapes into the wood with, the three in pursuit. After Arthur trips, he sees Hook and kicks him down and draws his sword on him, but just before he can kill Hook, Emma suddenly shows up and uses the now-reunited Excalibur stop Arthur's attack, telling a stunned Arthur that the sword no longer controls anyone, before sending him flying into a tree. Hook thanks Emma, but Emma says that there's no need to. Hook apologizes for what he said on his ship, and when Emma asks if he meant his saying that he didn't love her, or refusing to accept who she now was, {{he says that he}} still did and will always love her. When Emma asks Hook what he wants, he says that he wants to help her, and asks who Nimue is. She says that Nimue doesn't matter anymore, and that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>all</b> be over tomorrow. Hook asks why she needs the sword. Emma walks away and Hook says he knows she has reasons for doing this, and Emma tells Hook that she does, and that she’s doing all of this for him, before disappearing.|$|E
500|$|Professional teams coveted Gyorko for his hitting ability, {{though they}} did not expect him to play shortstop at the {{professional}} level. Though his throwing arm was viewed as strong enough {{to allow him to}} play at any position in the infield, analysts believed that Gyorko would not have sufficient range or speed to play shortstop professionally, and Gyorko understood he would likely change positions. Regarding his defense, Gyorko said [...] "where I play [...] isn't a big concern for me. I'm just ready for this chance to live a dream and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>all</b> work out." ...|$|E

500|$|William {{spent the}} {{remaining}} time during his brother's reign in the House of Lords. He supported the Catholic Emancipation Bill against {{the opposition of}} his younger brother, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, describing the latter's position on the Bill as [...] "infamous", to the Duke of Cumberland's outrage. George IV's health was increasingly bad; it was obvious by early 1830 that he was near death. The King took his leave of his younger brother {{at the end of}} May, stating, [...] "God's will be done. I have injured no man. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>all</b> rest on you then." [...] William's genuine affection for his older brother could not mask his rising anticipation that he would soon be king.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway scholar Wendolyn Tetlow {{says that}} from its {{inception}} the collection was written with a rhythmic and lyrical unity reminiscent of Pound's [...] "Hugh Selwyn Mauberley" [...] and T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land. The carefully crafted sequence continues in the 1925 edition, beginning with the first five Nick Adams stories, which are about violence and doom, empty relationships and characters lacking self-awareness. The first two stories, [...] "Indian Camp" [...] and [...] "The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife", {{can be read as}} an exercise in counterpoint, where feelings of loss, anger, and evil are ignored and repressed. [...] "The End of Something" [...] and [...] "The Three-Day Blow" [...] also form a pair; in the first Nick breaks up with his girlfriend, in the second he gets drunk and denies the relationship has ended, convincing himself that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>all</b> work out. This state of denial continues in [...] "The Battler", the fifth story; when faced with violence Nick will not recognize that he is in danger. [...] "A Very Short Story", about betrayal, and wounding, ends the sequence according to Tetlow, who suggests these are stories in which Hemingway writes about the [...] "most bitter feelings of loss and disillusionment". The characters face loss with inner strength, stoicism and a sense of acceptance; they build strength in the stories that come after, gaining self-awareness as they accept the futility and pain of life. The collection ends with [...] "Big Two-Hearted River", in which Nick finds tranquility, perhaps even happiness, in solitude. Wagner-Martin notes that [...] "it is this essential tranquility that in retrospect heightens the tension and sorrow of the preceding pieces." ...|$|E
500|$|Raising {{a family}} {{is not an easy}} task, and {{deciding}} {{to go back to school}} while raising a family can be a monumentual decision for the family says Carol Jacobs of the Jewish Employ-ment & Vocational Service. Her advice to those considering going back to school is, [...] "Talk to an educational consultant and people in the field you want to be in." [...] She adds, [...] "This is a commitment and the decision should involve your family. Will you be available to go to your child's softball game or have time to cook dinner?" [...] There are many reasons why someone may put off to school until their children are older, such as not wanting to leave them in the hand of a baby sitter constantly at such a young age. However, once the children get older the parent pursuing an education, may start missing school events that they would have normally attended. The guilt of having to leave a child while attending to educational matters is less when the child is old enough to be able to ask questions about where their parent is and comprehend the response. Even though pursuing an education while nurturing a family will have its cost, the benefits include getting a higher paying job, gaining more knowledge, and becoming more stable financially. Most of the time this burden will include the person trying to balance a job along with their family and schooling, because they still need to work in order to provide for their family at the present moment. For people who have a hard time fitting classes into their schedule around the needs of their family, there are options where they will be required to do all of the work for a course, but <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>all</b> take place online. For example, the University of Delaware and the University of Phoenix Online have both Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Master of Science in Nursing programs for people to complete online.|$|E

Soule was unable to write a full orchestral score for Knights of the Old Republic due to technical limitations: [...] "At the time we only had an 8 megabit per second MIDI system. That was state of the art... I had to fool people into thinking they were hearing a full orchestra. I’d write woodwinds and drums, or woodwinds, horns and drums, or strings and drums and brass. I couldn’t run the whole orchestra at once, it was impossible." ...|$|E
2500|$|With their breakup {{announced}} well in advance, Big Black recorded {{their final}} album, Songs About Fucking, half in London and half at Albini's home studio. Their final tours began in June 1987, {{taking them to}} Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and across the United States. They performed at the Pukkelpop festival in Belgium with Sonic Youth on July 22, Albini's 25th birthday. At a sold-out show in London for 1,300 people, Bruce Gilbert and Graham Lewis of Wire joined Big Black onstage to play an encore of Wire's [...] "Heartbeat" [...] (Big Black had released a cover version of the song as a single in conjunction with Headache). Albini wrote of the experience that [...] "If I die right now <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>all</b> have been worth it." [...] In the United States the band played in San Francisco, Providence, Boston, and New York City, concluding with their final performance on August 11, 1987 at the Georgetown Steam Plant in Seattle.

2500|$|Norway's Dagbladet {{reported}} that Doncaster Belles favoured a typically English style: [...] "heavy, solid and with many long balls." [...] Although the Belles were a completely amateur outfit, the BBC {{reported that}} they would present {{a much more difficult}} challenge than Fulham had been accustomed to that season. In the 2001–02 National Division Doncaster Belles had finished as runners-up for the third season in succession. In the Premier League Cup they suffered a shock semi final defeat by Birmingham City, collapsing from 31 ahead to lose 43 to the Northern Division leaders. In April 2002 they had [...] "stunningly" [...] inflicted a 40 defeat on Arsenal, the eventual champions' first league defeat in over two and a half years. Manager Julie Chipchase accepted that Fulham were favourites but noted the strength of her own squad: [...] "It's an unusual situation for us to go into a match as the underdogs and I am hoping it will work in our favour. The pressure will be on Fulham but they have some excellent international class players just as we do and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>all</b> be down to who performs on the day." ...|$|E

He was told that Irina would be in residence and Rasputin would have an opportunity to meet her. Rasputin had often expressed interest in meeting the beautiful 21-year-old princess. Irina, however, was on a visit to the Crimea. Irina had been aware that Felix had talked about eliminating Rasputin and it was originally intended that she participate in the murder. [...] "You too must take part in it," [...] Felix wrote to her before the murder. [...] "Dm(itri) Pavl(ovich) knows all about it and is helping. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>all</b> take place in the middle of December, when Dm(itri) comes back." [...] In late November 1916, Irina wrote to Felix: [...] "Thanks for your insane letter. I didn't understand the half of it. I see that you're planning to do something wild. Please take care and do not get mixed up in any shady business. The dirtiest thing is that you have decided to do it all without me. I don't see how I can take part in it now, since it's all arranged... In a word, be careful. I see from your letter that you're in a state of wild enthusiasm and ready to climb a wall...
