The digestive tract was removed from fish collected from nature and fixed for some morphometric analyses, such as: intestinal quotient, intestinal area quotient, vilosity height, digestive somatic index, and hepatosomatic index.

The metal contents were expressed in mg kg(- 1) wet weight. The mean mercury levels in liver were 4. 50 and 2. 37 whereas, in skin, such values were 0. 59 and 0. 36 (Madeira and Azores, respectively). Onaverage, the muscle content was around 0. 9 in fish from both areas. Cadmium maximum levels in muscle and skin were found in Azores samples (0. 09 and 0. 11, respectively). Mean lead contents in all samples were always below than 0. 10. In general, the results obtained did not allow the establishment of any relationship between metal accumulation and <b>fish</b> <b>weight</b> <b>or</b> length. According to the permissible WHO and FAO levels, these results, suggest that this species does not represent a risk for human consumption if the liver is excluded and the edible part consumed with moderation.

The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the methylmercury (MeHg) concentration in fish tissue from the Roosevelt River. The river's water velocity, depth, pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen and substrate type were measured, and fifty specimens distributed in 14 fish species were collected. A total of 64. 3 % of the sampled species were of the order Characiform and 71. 4 % of the species were carnivores. Fifty percent of the species had MeHg concentrations above threshold limit (Hg-T 0. 5 mg kg- 1) established for food by the World Health Organization. Cichla monoculus had the highest value of MeHg (2. 45 mg kg- 1). The MeHg concentration in fish varied according to dietary habits. The study also found bioaccumulation of MeHg in fish tissue in the following descending order: carnivorous > detritivorous > frugivore.

Five isoenergetics–isonitrogenous diets containing 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0 g/ 100 g of fungi Trichoderma reesei-degraded date pits (FDDP), as a replacement for dietary α-cellulose, were used to feed triplicate groups of fish fingerlings (2. 0 g initial weight), for 9 weeks. Tilapia weight gain (4. 27 g/g), was superior only in fish fed on diets containing 0. 5 g/ 100 g FDDP, when compared with those fish fed on other diets. Blood haemoglobin was found to be unchanged in fish fed on different percentages of FDDP diets. Plasma glucose was high in fish fed on 0. 5 % FDDP, the accompanied plasma hypertriglyceridemia, could possibly be due to hepatic neo lipogenesis. Cholesterol levels in fish plasma fed on experimental FDDP diets at all concentrations were highly and significantly decreased which may indicate the attenuated ability for transporting lipid out of liver. Although significant correlation among the physiological indices and the dietary FDDP have been observed, blood haemoglobin, plasma triglycerides and cholesterol are shown as more sensitive indicators followed by plasma glucose and then growth rate. The present study showed a possible potential of using FDDP to lower the bacterial population densities in O. niloticus intestine without affecting the <b>fish</b> <b>weight</b> <b>or</b> health welfare condition, that could be an excellent approach in designing subsequent probiotic researches on FDDP. Oestradiol was measured in all tested diets and was found to increase linearly with FDDP content in diets, which indicates that a FDDP may has phytoestrogenic roll...|$|R

40|$|The Greater Pittsburgh Area {{is famous}} for its three rivers: the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio Rivers. These rivers have a history of being {{polluted}} by decades of mine runoff and chemicals released by industrial sites. New problems, such as pollution from endocrine disrupting compounds and xenoestrogens, have recently been discovered in this well known aquatic environment and are suspected to be caused by the failing sewer system. Personal care products, pharmaceuticals and plasticizers all have the potential to enter the water supply though both treated and untreated sewage. Many of these compounds are known or suspected endocrine disruptors. Estrogenic potential of fish extracts from flesh/fat tissue captured from Freeport and Ford City was studied via the E-Screen Assay on MCF- 7, T 47 D and BT- 20 human breast cancer cell lines. Results showed weak estrogenic responses in both MCF- 7 and T 47 D cell lines, with no significant differences for <b>fish</b> gender, <b>weight,</b> <b>or</b> sample location. Estrogenic potential of extracts from fish brain tissue was tested via Bromodeoxyuridine MCF- 7 Analysis and paired with High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry to investigate the presence of specific xenoestrogens in the fish extracts. Fifty eight fish were sampled from rivers in the Greater Pittsburgh Area. All samples were non-detectable for methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl parabens. Bisphenol A (BPA) was detected in 44 of the 58 samples, with a range from non-detectable to 120 pg/gram.
