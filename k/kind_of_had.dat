500|$|In a July 2009 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Cornell shot down {{rumors of a}} reunion, saying that conversations between the band members had been limited to discussion about {{the release of a}} box set or B-sides album of Soundgarden rarities, and that there had been no discussion of a reunion at all. The band's interest in new releases emerged from a 2008 meeting about their shared properties, both financial and legal, where they realized Soundgarden lacked online presence such as a website or a Facebook page. As Thayil summed up, [...] "we <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>had</b> neglected our merchandise over the last decade". Eventually the musicians decided to create an official site handled by Pearl Jam's Ten Club, relaunch their catalog, and according to Cameron, seek [...] "a bunch of unreleased stuff we wanted to try to put out". On March 2009, Thayil, Shepherd and Cameron got onstage during a concert by Tad Doyle in Seattle and played some Soundgarden songs. Cornell stated that the moment [...] "sort of sparked the idea: If Matt, Kim, and Ben can get in a room, rehearse a couple songs, and play, maybe we all could do that as Soundgarden." ...|$|E

500|$|Vincent Kartheiser, then 23, {{was looking}} for {{something}} more stable than the usual feature movies. He decided to audition after his agent sent him the role and tapes of all previous seasons. The producers wanted the character to be a surprise to audiences, so not even Kartheiser was informed that he was trying out for Angel's son. Instead he auditioned for a character created for the purpose of audition, ‘the Street Kid’, a normal teenager who had Angel as his guardian. [...] "Right away everyone <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>had</b> a good feeling about me joining the cast," [...] Vincent says. [...] "It seemed that I just fit right in." [...] Kartheiser was excited after learning that his real role was 'Angel's son, a demon killer from Quor'toth.’ He was confused about his portrayal, thinking that the character was to have a [...] "living-in-the-brush kind of ‘failed being’ attitude." [...] Instead, he was told to just [...] "stand up straight, [...] normal voice," [...] and let a regular boy come on. Vincent Kartheiser was initially contracted for three episodes with an option to pick him up further.|$|E
500|$|Fresco {{approached}} Jonathan Slavin, {{with whom}} he had previously worked on the sitcom Andy Richter Controls the Universe, about playing the role of Phil. Being a fan of Slavin's work, he thought he'd be great for the role. Andrea Anders, whom Fresco previously enjoyed on The Class, and Malcolm Barrett were cast for the roles of Linda and Lem respectively. Portia de Rossi met with Fresco about the role of Veronica. Fresco assessed during their meeting that de Rossi was completely convinced that the role was perfect for her and that she was born to play it. He thought de Rossi nailed the role and cast her. When asked what drew her to the role, de Rossi replied, [...] "I'm really attracted to strong women." [...] De Rossi further went on to say, [...] "I <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>had</b> to throw myself at [...] I told him I'd played this character who had similar qualities, very work driven, strong, insensitive, slightly chilly. I had to convince him I could play this character well and could play a character of this nature." [...] Jay Harrington was the first person Fresco met with when trying to cast someone as Ted Crisp. Although Fresco really liked Harrington, he decided to see more people before casting the role. After five weeks, Harrington was cast.|$|E

I would force myself to write lyrics. I was playing people's demos. I was still into the band. It's just that I didn't have anything.|$|E

2500|$|This was {{the first}} {{recording}} studio experience for McCready and Vedder. Regarding McCready, Cornell said, [...] "You almost <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>had</b> to yell at him {{to get him to}} realize that in the five-and-a-half minute solo of 'Reach Down', that was his time and that he wasn't going to be stepping on anybody else." [...] The song [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was having trouble with the vocals at practice, when Vedder stepped in. Cornell later said [...] "he sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively".|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Orci {{had begun}} writing the script with Patrick McKay and J. D.

It's the Chicago Bulls in space, in terms of these people who are all awesome at their job." [...] In January 2015, after Orci's departure, Simon Pegg and Doug Jung were hired to rewrite the screenplay, with Pegg saying on the previous draft, Paramount [...] "had a script for Star Trek that wasn't really working for them. I think the studio was worried that it might have been a little bit too Star Trek-y." [...] Pegg had been asked to make the new film [...] "more inclusive", stating that the solution was to [...] "make a western or a thriller or a heist movie, then populate that with Star Trek characters so it's more inclusive to an audience that might be a little bit reticent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior {{to writing}} the album, the band spent time revisiting music from their youth that first {{inspired}} {{them to be}} in a band. Chad Gilbert described how he spent six months [...] "only listening to the Ramones, old Lookout! Records stuff, Green Day's Dookie, Descendents, Rancid's Let's Go and that's pretty much it." [...] Gilbert had a direct musical vision for the album, similar to how he describes that Coming Home (2006) had, as opposed to Not Without a Fight (2009), where the attitude was simply [...] "let's record a New Found Glory album." [...] The band strove to [...] "apply the throwback vibe to their always-evolving style," [...] by incorporating the elements from those classic albums; [...] "it was simple, it was fun, it was heartfelt, but it also <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>had</b> an attitude," [...] with the hallmarks of their own career. Gilbert described how he wanted to [...] "bridge the gap between generations", hoping for reactions such as [...] "Dude that's totally Ramones, but it's not the Ramones, it's New Found Glory. Or like, Dude, that totally reminds me of when I heard Dookie for the first time, but it's totally not, it's New Found Glory." [...] As such, the band were meticulous in the writing process, discarding anything that was not in line with the album's vision or songs that felt [...] "safe". Gilbert described that because they wanted a [...] "fun, punk, upbeat record," [...] any songs he would write that appeared [...] "a slower, mellower, mid-pace thing," [...] would be scrapped. Jordan Pundik told Rock Sound magazine that, [...] " [...] we simplified the songs. There's no riffing or jamming going on. It's just straight up and in-your-face." ...|$|E
