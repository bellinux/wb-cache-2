5|$|As the Empire of Japan invaded and {{occupied}} Shanghai {{and much of}} east China, Hu Die and Pan Yousheng fled to British Hong Kong. Hu Die {{gave birth to a}} daughter and a boy during this time. Pan worked for a trading firm in Hong Kong, while she also made two films. After the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941, Hong Kong also fell to the Japanese. The Japanese pressured her to make a documentary film entitled Hu Die Touring Tokyo for their war propaganda, but Hu Die refused to become a collaborator, and secretly escaped to inland Chongqing, the war-time capital of the Republic of China resistance. It was a long and circuitous journey through a war zone. She entrusted her belongings to the underground, and casually walked out of her Hong Kong home one day. Resistance partisans guided her through the New Territories to Guangdong province.

5|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> a half, Polish patriots {{waited while}} {{planning}} an insurrection. On March 24, 1794 in Kraków, Tadeusz Kościuszko declared {{what has come}} to be known as the Kościuszko Uprising. On May 7, he issued the Proclamation of Połaniec (Uniwersał Połaniecki), granting freedom to the peasants and ownership of land to all who fought in the insurrection. Revolutionary tribunals administered summary justice to those deemed traitors to the Commonwealth. After initial victories at the Battle of Racławice (April 4), the capture of Warsaw (April 18) and the Wilno (April 22)the Uprising was crushed when the forces of Russia, Austria and Prussia joined in a military intervention. Historians consider the Uprising's defeat to have been a foregone conclusion in face of the superiority in numbers and resources of the three invading powers. The defeat of Kościuszko's forces led in 1795 to the third and final partition of the Commonwealth.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, {{the freeway}} was {{extended}} eastward {{a few blocks}} through a junction with the newly opened Chrysler Freeway (I-75) to its present-day eastern terminus near Conant Street. The state requested additional Interstate Highway System mileage that year as well, and in the proposals submitted was a request to extend the Davison to I-96 and I-94. These plans to transfer the freeway to state control and extend it were dropped in the 1970s after opposition to another freeway in Detroit. The plans would have extended it west to the Jeffries and east to a Van Dyke Freeway (extended M-53). Upon its transfer to state control in 1993, it had previously been a county-maintained freeway, the Davison Freeway was designated as M-8. Three years later, the Davison was closed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> a half to reconstruct it to Interstate Highway standards with an additional through travel lane and a wider left shoulder for improved safety and traffic handling {{as well as a}} new interchange with Woodward Avenue. The reconstructed freeway was reopened on October 8, 1997 by Governor John Engler.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, a {{small group}} of American Nazis, led by Frank Collin, applied to the town of Skokie, Illinois for {{permission}} to hold a demonstration in the town park.

Skokie refused to grant permission, and an Illinois judge supported Skokie and prohibited the demonstration. Skokie immediately passed three ordinances aimed at preventing the group from meeting in Skokie. The ACLU assisted Collin and appealed to federal court.
