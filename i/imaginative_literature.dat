500|$|In the Quarterly Review in 1821, the English {{writer and}} theologian Richard Whately {{published}} {{the most serious}} and enthusiastic early posthumous review of Austen's work. Whately drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, praising the dramatic qualities of her narrative. He also affirmed the respectability and legitimacy of the novel as a genre, arguing that <b>imaginative</b> <b>literature,</b> especially narrative, was more valuable than history or biography. When it was properly done, as in Austen, Whately said, <b>imaginative</b> <b>literature</b> concerned itself with generalised human experience from which the reader could gain important insights into human nature; in other words, it was moral. Whately also addressed Austen's position as a female writer, writing: [...] "we suspect one of Miss Austin's [...] great merits in our eyes to be, the insight she gives us into the peculiarities of female [...] heroines are what one knows women must be, though one never can get them to acknowledge it." [...] No more significant, original Austen criticism was published until the late 19th century: Whately and Scott had {{set the tone for}} the Victorian era's view of Austen.|$|E
500|$|Though Hazlitt {{could find}} much to {{appreciate}} in the comedies, tragedy {{was to him}} inherently more important, and he weights the tragedies much more heavily. In this he differed from Johnson, who thought Shakespeare best at comedy. The greatest of the plays were tragedies—particularly Macbeth, Othello, King Lear, and Hamlet—and Hazlitt's comments on tragedy are often integrated with his ideas {{about the significance of}} poetry and <b>imaginative</b> <b>literature</b> in general. As he expressed it at the end of [...] "Lear", tragedy describes the strongest passions, and [...] "the greatest strength of genius is shewn here in describing the strongest passions: for the power of the imagination, in works of invention, must be in proportion to the force of the natural impressions, which are the subject of them." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} one of the most {{important}} texts of <b>imaginative</b> <b>literature</b> and had a lasting impact on the fantasy genre, directly giving rise to the 'lost civilisation' tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and the creation of mythologised locations such as Shangri-la. Tolkien recognised the importance of She to his own fantasy works, especially in its foregrounding of a fictional history and narrative. The figure of She is also considered by many scholars to be a formative influence on Galadriel [...] – Ayesha's reflecting pool seems to be a direct precursor of Galadriel's mirror. [...] Other characters in Tolkien's Legendarium also seem to have been influenced, including Shelob (who is referred to as [...] "She" [...] and [...] "Her" [...] in the text), and the escape across the chasm is highly reminiscent of the escape of the Fellowship across the chasm in Moria. Indeed, Haggard's characterisation of Ayesha became the prototype of the female antagonist in modern fantasy literature, most famously realised in the figure of the White Witch, Jadis, from C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia.|$|E

I argue that these annotated literatures are Enlightenment-inspired, Foucauldian discursive sites (archives). These archives consist of collected ideas of human history catalogued through the annotations that de- and recontextualize them into an imaginative record {{as a way to}} explore and come to terms with Britain's past. To illustrate this claim, I wed archival research with media-historical readings of works by the antiquarian Thomas Percy, the Irish novelist Sydney Owenson (Lady Morgan), the poet Lord Byron, and the Scottish author James Hogg. I argue that the literary footnote offers these authors-as-editors a way to collect and curate textual artifacts into an imaginative record in order to explore and {{come to terms with the}} past. Narrative as Archive calls attention to the collapse of distinctions between author/editor, page/margin, poetry/prose. In sum, I argue that greater consideration to the material manifestations of knowledge work in these <b>imaginative</b> <b>literatures</b> can allow critics to navigate the division between form and content [...] and between media history and literary analysis [...] in the study of Enlightenment and Romantic-Era British Literature. This body of work offers an especially rich archive for exploration, in part because it initially was constructed as one...|$|R

40|$|Where is {{imagination}} in imaginative resistance? We seek {{to answer this}} question by connecting two ongoing lines of inquiry in different subfields of philosophy. In philosophy of mind, philosophers have been trying to understand imaginative attitudes’ place in cognitive architecture. In aesthetics, philosophers have been trying to understand the phenomenon of imaginative resistance. By connecting these two lines of inquiry, we hope to find mutual illumination of an attitude (or cluster of attitudes) and a phenomenon that have vexed philosophers. Our strategy is to reorient the <b>imaginative</b> resistance <b>literature</b> from the perspective of cognitive architecture. Whereas existing taxonomies of positions in the <b>imaginative</b> resistance <b>literature</b> have focused on disagreements over the source and scope of the phenomenon, our taxonomy focuses on the psychological components necessary for explaining imaginative resistance...|$|R

40|$|Traits, characteristics, {{interests}} and educational experiences of ten children who “love to build, ” are fascinated by “how things work ” and are precocious in {{their understanding of}} physical phenomena and other “systems, ” are described in this qualitative, multi-case study. Among the findings are descriptions of disinterest in pretend play and narrative, alongside descriptions of an intense passion for figuring out how “things ” (and other systems) work. I discuss {{the implications of these}} findings for imaginative education. While the <b>imaginative</b> education <b>literature</b> embraces narrative and metaphor as tools for understanding the human condition, this paper explores the possibility that for some children, imagination consists primarily of building “if … then ” structures as tools for understanding the physical world. Children like the ones described in this study may be best served by using logical, rule-bound systems to scaffold their understanding of narrative and myth. This direction of mediation is in contrast to that presented by much of the <b>imaginative</b> education <b>literature.</b> Our conception of imagination may need to expand if we are to accommodate children with alternative cognitive orientations within the imaginative education movement...|$|R
2500|$|After the war, Rivers became [...] "another and far happier man – diffidence gave {{place to}} confidence, reticence to outspokenness, a {{somewhat}} laboured literary style to one remarkable for ease and charm". He {{is quoted as}} saying [...] "I have finished my serious work and I shall just let myself go." [...] In those post war years, his personality seemed to change dramatically. The man who had been most at home in his study, the laboratory, or the field now dined out a good deal, had joined clubs, went yachting and appeared to welcome rather than shun opportunities for public speaking. Always having been a voracious reader, he now began reading in philosophy, as he had not done for some years, and also in <b>imaginative</b> <b>literature.</b> Not all of his friends from former years welcomed these changes; some felt that, along with his shyness, his scientific caution and good sense may have deserted him to a degree but most people who saw how happy Rivers had become agreed that the slight alterations to his character were for the better.|$|E
2500|$|Byron's dramas are undramatic. [...] "They {{abound in}} speeches and descriptions, such {{as he himself}} might make either to himself or others, lolling on his couch of a morning, but do not carry the reader out of the poet's mind to the scenes and events recorded." [...] In this Byron follows most of his contemporaries, as Hazlitt argued in many of his {{critical}} writings, the tendency of the age, in <b>imaginative</b> <b>literature</b> as well as philosophical and scientific, being toward generalisation, [...] "abstraction". Also counteracting his immense power, the tone of {{even some of the}} best of Byron's poetry is violated by annoying descents into the ridiculous. [...] "You laugh and are surprised that any one should turn round and travestie himself". [...] This is shown especially in the early parts of Don Juan, where, [...] "after the lightning and the hurricane, we are introduced to the interior of the cabin and the contents of wash-hand basins." [...] After noting several such provoking incongruities, Hazlitt characterises Don Juan overall as [...] "a poem written about itself" [...] (he reserves judgement about the later cantos of that poem).|$|E

40|$|Novel Science is {{the first}} {{in-depth}} study of the shocking, groundbreaking, and sometimes beautiful writings of the gentlemen of the “heroic age” of geology and of the contribution these men made to the literary culture of their day. For these men, literature was {{an essential part of}} the practice of science itself, as important to their efforts as mapmaking, fieldwork, and observation. The reading and writing of <b>imaginative</b> <b>literatures</b> helped them to discover, imagine, debate, and give shape and meaning to millions of years of previously undiscovered earth history. Borrowing from the historical fictions of Walter Scott and the poetry of Lord Byron, they invented geology as a science, discovered many of the creatures we now call the dinosaurs, and were the first to unravel and map the sequence and structure of stratified rock. As Adelene Buckland shows, they did this by rejecting the grand narratives of older theories of the earth or of biblical cosmogony: theirs would be a humble science, faithfully recording minute details and leaving the big picture for future generations to paint. Buckland also reveals how these scientists—just as they had drawn inspiration from their literary predecessors—gave Victorian realist novelists such as George Eliot, Charles Kingsley, and Charles Dickens a powerful language with which to create dark and disturbing ruptures in the too-seductive sweep of story...|$|R

40|$|Literature {{represents}} human’s {{experiences of}} life using language as its medium. Literature offers the readers either imaginative stories or any factual information. Therefore, literature {{is divided into}} two; <b>imaginative</b> and informative <b>literature.</b> Among <b>imaginative</b> <b>literatures,</b> song lyric is one of them. Hornby (1974 : 822) stated that, song lyric is a short poem {{in a number of}} verses set to music two be sung. In its writing, the songwriters or composers usually beautify the language they use by any figurative language, so that the listeners will be more attracted in listening the song. This study is aimed at describing the existance of figurative and moral lesson in the lyrics of Scorpion’s song. The choice of Scorpion’s songs is based on to reasons. The first is writer himself is a big fan of Scorpion. The second is the scorpion’s songs does not only talk about love, but also freedom, equality, and other social issues. The writer of this thesis uses descriptive method. The population was fifteen song available in the album of Acoustica. Five songs are randomly drawn as the sample of the study by random sampling. Those song are You and I, Under the Same Sun, Love of My Life, Life is Too Short, and Wind of Change. In analyzing the lyrics, the writer of this thesis uses objective approach. After completing the study, the writer found out that the existing kind of figurative language in the lyric’s of Scorpion’s songs were paradox (5. 7 %), antithesis (18. 57 %), euphemism (20 %), apostrophe (17. 14 %), synecdoche (5. 7 %), irony (5. 7 %), parallelism (2. 85 %), hyperbole (5. 7 %), simile (5. 7 %), personification (8. 75 %), and allusion (14. 28 %). Meanwhile the moral lesson found were: The war is so cruel that people should not declare in order to evade great loss of many innocent civilian’s life (Under the Same Sun); Most citizens of any nation prefer to live democratically (Wind of Changes); A couple of lovers should trust and be loyal to each other (You and I); Loyalty is what a lover should give for his/her couple (Love of My Life); A lover should use time available wisely to please his couple (Love is Too Short) ...|$|R
