2500|$|In {{a typical}} {{civilian}} sport parachute system, the pilot-chute {{is connected to}} a line known as the [...] "bridle", {{which in turn is}} attached to a small <b>deployment</b> <b>bag</b> that contains the folded parachute and the canopy suspension lines, which are stowed with rubber bands. At the bottom of the container that holds the <b>deployment</b> <b>bag</b> is a closing loop which, during packing, is fed through the grommets of the four flaps that are used to close the container. At that point, a curved pin that is attached to the bridle is inserted through the closing loop. The next step involves folding the pilot-chute and placing it in a pouch (e.g., B.O.C pouch).|$|E
2500|$|Activation {{begins when}} the pilot-chute is thrown out. It inflates and creates drag, pulling the pin {{out of the}} closing loop and {{allowing}} the pilot-chute to pull the <b>deployment</b> <b>bag</b> from the container. The parachute lines are pulled loose from the rubber bands and extend as the canopy starts to open. A rectangular piece of fabric called the [...] "slider" [...] (which separates the parachute lines into four main groups fed through grommets in the four respective corners of the slider) slows {{the opening of the}} parachute and works its way down until the canopy is fully open and the slider is just above the head of the skydiver. The slider slows and controls the deployment of the parachute. Without a slider, the parachute would inflate fast, potentially damaging the parachute fabric and/or suspension lines, as well as causing discomfort, injury or even death of the jumper. During a normal deployment, a skydiver will generally experience a few seconds of intense deceleration, in the realm of 3 to 4 g, while the parachute slows the descent from [...] to approximately 28km/h (17mph).|$|E
50|$|Paratroopers' main parachutes {{are usually}} {{deployed}} by static lines that release the parachute, yet retain the <b>deployment</b> <b>bag</b> {{that contains the}} parachute—without relying on a pilot chute for deployment. In this configuration the <b>deployment</b> <b>bag</b> {{is known as a}} direct-bag system, in which the deployment is rapid, consistent, and reliable.|$|E
50|$|After the drogue chute has {{stabilized}} the SRB in a tail-first attitude, the frustum {{is separated}} from the forward skirt by a pyrotechnic charge triggered by the low-altitude baroswitch at a nominal altitude of 5500 ft about 243 seconds after SRB separation. The frustum is then {{pulled away from the}} SRB by the drogue chute. The main chute suspension lines are pulled out from <b>deployment</b> <b>bags</b> that remain in the frustum. At full extension of the lines, which are 203 ft long, the three main chutes are pulled from their <b>deployment</b> <b>bags</b> and inflate to their first reefed condition. The frustum and drogue parachute continue on a separate trajectory to splashdown. After specified time delays (using redundant 10 and 17-second reefing line cutters), the main chute reefing lines are cut and the chutes inflate to their second reefed and full open configurations. The main chute cluster decelerates the SRB to terminal conditions. Each of the 136 ft diameter, 20-degree conical ribbon parachutes have a design load of approximately 195000 lb and each weighs approximately 2180 lb. These parachutes are the largest that have ever been used — both in deployed size and load weight. The RSRM nozzle extension is severed by a pyrotechnic charge about 20 seconds after frustum separation.|$|R

40|$|The Parachute Decelerator System (PDS) is {{comprised}} of all components associated with the supersonic parachute and its associated deployment. During the Supersonic Flight Dynamics Test (SFDT), for the Low Density Supersonic Decelerators Program, the PDS was required to deploy the supersonic parachute in a defined fashion. The PDS hardware includes three major subsystems that must function together. The first subsystem is the Parachute Deployment Device (PDD), which acts as a modified pilot deployment system. It {{is comprised}} of a pyrotechnic mortar, a Kevlar ballute, a lanyard actuated pyrotechnic inflation aid, and rigging with its associated thermal protection material (TPS). The second subsystem is the supersonic parachute deployment hardware. This includes all of the parachute specific rigging that includes the parachute stowage can and the rigging including TPS and bridle stiffeners for bridle management during deployment. The third subsystem is the Supersonic Parachute itself, which includes the main parachute and <b>deployment</b> <b>bags.</b> This paper summarizes the verification and validation of the deployment process, from the initialization of the PDS system through parachute bag strip that was done prior to the first SFDT...|$|R

50|$|This {{happens with}} the popular {{throw-out}} deployment system where the pilot chute does not pull the pin and open the container or once opened does not exert enough force to extract the <b>deployment</b> <b>bag</b> from the container. It {{can be caused by}} pilot chutes with kill lines that have not been cocked during packing or where the kill line has shrunk through use and reduces the drag of the pilot chute. It can be caused by a mis-routed pilot chute bridle. It can also be caused by too large a <b>deployment</b> <b>bag</b> and canopy for the container, although deployment bags should be matched to the containers. The correct procedure with this malfunction is to deploy the reserve from a stable belly down position. If time permits, the skydiver might first attempt to bump their container to dislodge a trapped <b>deployment</b> <b>bag.</b> If this malfunction is temporary and clears, it is called a pilot chute hesitation.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{analysis}} provided effectiveness {{estimates of}} the driver-side air bag while controlling for severity of the crash and other potential confounders. METHODS: Data were from the National Automotive Sampling System (1993 - 1996). Injury severity was described {{on the basis of}} the Abbreviated Injury Scale, Injury Severity Score, Functional Capacity Index, and survival. Ordinal, linear, and logistic multivariate regression methods were used. RESULTS: Air <b>bag</b> <b>deployment</b> in frontal or near-frontal crashes decreases the probability of having severe and fatal injuries (e. g., Abbreviated Injury Scale score of 4 - 6), including those causing a long-lasting high degree of functional limitation. However, air <b>bag</b> <b>deployment</b> in low-severity crashes increases the probability that a driver (particularly a woman) will sustain injuries of Abbreviated Injury Scale level 1 to 3. Air <b>bag</b> <b>deployment</b> exerts a net injurious effect in low-severity crashes and a net protective effect in high-severity crashes. The level of crash severity at which air bags are protective is higher for female than for male drivers. CONCLUSIONS: Air bag improvement should minimize the injuries induced by their deployment. One possibility is to raise their deployment level so that they deploy only in more severe crashes...|$|R
40|$|Air bags {{have been}} and {{continue}} to be an effective, lifesaving technology. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has estimated that air bags have saved almost 1, 500 lives, with an estimated 569 lives saved in 1995 alone. However, the increasing availability of air bags in passenger vehicles and light trucks has seen a concomitant rise in the report of injuries related to air <b>bag</b> <b>deployment.</b> While the vast majority of these injuries has been minor, the exposure of children to passenger-side air <b>bag</b> <b>deployments</b> has resulted in reports of more serious injuries.

5000|$|A {{pilot chute}} {{is a small}} {{auxiliary}} parachute used to deploy the main or reserve parachute. The pilot chute {{is connected to the}} <b>deployment</b> <b>bag</b> containing the parachute by a bridle. On modern skydiving rigs three types of pilot chutes can be found: ...|$|E
50|$|Reserve parachutes {{usually have}} a ripcord {{deployment}} system, which was first designed by Theodore Moscicki, but most modern main parachutes used by sports parachutists use a form of hand-deployed pilot chute. A ripcord system pulls a closing pin (sometimes multiple pins), which releases a spring-loaded pilot chute, and opens the container; the pilot chute is then propelled into the air stream by its spring, then uses the force generated by passing air to extract a <b>deployment</b> <b>bag</b> containing the parachute canopy, {{to which it is}} attached via a bridle. A hand-deployed pilot chute, once thrown into the air stream, pulls a closing pin on the pilot chute bridle to open the container, then the same force extracts the <b>deployment</b> <b>bag.</b> There are variations on hand-deployed pilot chutes, but the system described is the more common throw-out system.|$|E
50|$|From 1990 to 2000, the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration {{identified}} 175 fatalities {{caused by}} air bags. Most of these (104) have been children, {{while the rest}} were adults.

25|$|Rapid <b>deployment</b> lift <b>bags</b> have a scuba {{cylinder}} {{mounted on}} the outside which contains sufficient air to inflate the bag at a specified depth. The bag can {{be attached to the}} load and when ready, the valve is opened and the diver swims clear. If the regulator pressure is set to a lower pressure than the over-pressure relief valve, a closed bag will automatically stop filling before the relief valve opens, but will be topped up if it leaks after reaching the surface. The regulator pressure must take into account the hydrostatic pressure difference between {{the top and bottom of}} the bag so that the bag will be completely filled.|$|R
50|$|Only the hand-deployed {{pilot chute}} may be {{collapsed}} automatically after deployment—by a kill line reducing the in-flight drag {{of the pilot}} chute on the main canopy. Reserves, on the other hand, do not retain their pilot chutes after deployment. The reserve <b>deployment</b> <b>bag</b> and pilot chute are not connected to the canopy in a reserve system. This {{is known as a}} free-bag configuration, and the components are sometimes not recovered after a reserve deployment.|$|E
50|$|The {{throw-out}} {{pilot chute}} {{is the most}} popular type in use today. The pilot chute is packed in a pouch {{at the bottom of the}} container (often called BOC for short). The handle is attached to the apex of the pilot chute. When the user grabs the handle and throws the pilot chute into the airstream, the bridle extends, pulling the closing pin and opening the container, as the pilot chute continues in the airstream it extracts the <b>deployment</b> <b>bag</b> containing the main parachute from the container. The pull-out pilot chute and the throw-out pilot chute were both invented by Bill Booth.|$|E
5000|$|For {{training}} {{students in}} civilian operations, modifications to existing static line equipment {{may be made}} to simplify operations. One such modification is to attach the <b>deployment</b> <b>bag</b> to the parachute instead of the static line, which also requires some modification to allow the static line to detach, typically a Velcro fastener. This leaves much less material [...] "in the wind" [...] behind the plane after the jumper has left. This isn't a problem for larger cargo aircraft used in military jumping, but presents a major issue for smaller aircraft used in civilian operations. This modification also results in a somewhat slower opening, which softens the opening shock {{at the cost of}} altitude, a minor concern for jumpers exiting at 2800 ft.|$|E
50|$|Like the {{generation}} before, a 2 air bag supplementary restraint system (SRS) with 2-way occupant protection was standard on Expedition. The dual front SRS air bags now included the Personal Safety System (PSS). PSS would tailor air <b>bag</b> <b>deployment</b> for driver and first passenger and included occupant classification, seat position, crash severity, safety belt pretensioner, load-limiting retractor and safety belt buckle usage sensors.|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of occupant protection systems, the authors measured the mortality reduction associated with air <b>bag</b> <b>deployment</b> and seat belt use for drivers involved in head-on passenger car collisions in the United States. They used a matched case-control design of all head-on collisions involving two passenger cars reported to the Fatality Analysis Reporting System in 1992 – 1997, and driver mortality differences between the paired crash vehicles for air <b>bag</b> <b>deployment</b> and seat belt use were measured with matched-pair odds ratios. Conditional logistic regression was used to adjust for multiple effects. There were 9, 859 head-on collisions involving 19, 718 passenger cars and drivers. Air <b>bag</b> <b>deployment</b> reduced mortality 63 % (crude odds ratio (OR) = 0. 37, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 32, 0. 42), while lap-shoulder belt use reduced mortality 72 % (OR = 0. 28, 95 % CI: 0. 25, 0. 31). In a conditional logistic model that adjusted for vehicle (rollover, weight, age) and driver (age, sex) factors, air bags (OR = 0. 71, 95 % CI: 0. 58, 0. 87) and any combination of seat belts (OR = 0. 25, 95 % CI: 0. 22, 0. 29) were both associated with reduced mortality. Combined air bag and seat belt use reduced mortality by more than 80 % (OR = 0. 18, 95 % CI: 0. 13, 0. 25). Thus, this study confirms the independent effect of air bags and seat belts in reducing mortality.

50|$|Depending upon {{air density}} and the jumper’s total weight, the parachute’s {{average rate of}} descent is from 22 to 24 ft/s; total {{suspended}} weight limitation is 360 lb. The parachute is deployed using either a 15 or 20 ft static line, allowing the parachutist to be delivered by either C-130 or C-17 aircraft. The T-10D main parachute is a parabolic-shape and has a nominal diameter of 35 ft with 30 suspension lines. The entire assembly weighs 31 lb. Paratroopers can be dropped from an aircraft at a maximum speed of 173 mph, at a minimum of 500 ft. Maximum jump wind speed is 15 mph. The T-10D Parachute assembly consists of five components: pack tray, troop harness, <b>deployment</b> <b>bag,</b> risers, and canopy. The parachute has a combined service life of 16.5 years; service life is 12 years and shelf life is 4.5 years. The T-10D Parachute must be repacked every 120 days. The T-10D Parachute is made of nylon materials commonly used in the manufacturing of parachutes.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "horseshoe" [...] {{describes}} a malfunction where a parachute deploys, but remains {{attached to a}} skydiver by its risers {{and at least one}} other point. This prevents the canopy from opening properly and the canopy and lines form a horseshoe shape extending from the risers up and then back down again to the other point where the parachute remains attached to or entangled with the skydiver. This malfunction may occur when the closing pin of a skydiving rig is released from the closing loop and allows the <b>deployment</b> <b>bag</b> to separate from the container. Because the pilot chute is still stowed, the malfunction takes on the shape of a horseshoe. This malfunction may also occur if the pilot chute or bridle connecting the pilot chute to the canopy becomes entangled with the skydiver. It is possible, though rare, to experience this type of malfunction when one or more parachute lines entangle with or snag on some portion of the parachute rig.|$|E
50|$|The {{recovery}} sequence {{begins with}} {{the operation of the}} high-altitude baroswitch, which triggers the pyrotechnic nose cap thrusters. This ejects the nose cap, which deploys the pilot parachute. Nose cap separation occurs at a nominal altitude of 15704 ft, about 218 seconds after SRB separation. The 11.5 ft diameter conical ribbon pilot parachute provides the force to pull lanyards attached to cut knives, which cut the loop securing the drogue retention straps. This allows the pilot chute to pull the drogue pack from the SRB, causing the drogue suspension lines to deploy from their stored position. At full extension of the twelve 105 ft suspension lines, the drogue <b>deployment</b> <b>bag</b> is stripped away from the canopy, and the 54 ft diameter conical ribbon drogue parachute inflates to its initial reefed condition. The drogue disreefs twice after specified time delays (using redundant 7 and 12-second reefing line cutters), and it reorients/stabilizes the SRB for main chute deployment. The drogue parachute has a design load of approximately 315000 lb and weighs approximately 1200 lb.|$|E

Although advanced restraint systems have been extensively tested in the laboratory, we are only beginning to understand the performance of these systems in the field. Because EDRs record many of the inputs to the advanced air bag control module, these devices can provide unique insights into the characteristics of field performance of air bags. The study was based on 164 advanced air bag cases extracted from NASS/CDS 2002 - 2006 with associated EDR data. In this dataset, advanced driver air bags were observed to deploy with a 50 % probability at a longitudinal delta-V of 9 mph for the first stage, and at 26 mph for both inflator stages. In general, advanced air bag performance was as expected, however, the study identified cases of air <b>bag</b> <b>deployments</b> at delta-Vs as low as 3 - 4 mph, non-deployments at delta-Vs over 26 mph, and possible delayed air <b>bag</b> <b>deployments...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Several crash {{discrimination}} algorithms {{have been}} developed {{in order to have}} timely air <b>bag</b> <b>deployment</b> during frontal crashes. However, it is still challenging to have timely air bag deploy-ment, especially during pole, underride, oblique and oVset crashes. Therefore, in this paper, a new algorithm for frontal crash discrimination is proposed, with the summation of the absolute value of the deceleration change being used as a metric and with the metric and its threshold being processed {{as a function of the}} velocity change. The new algorithm was applied to frontal crashes of a minivan and a sports utility vehicle, and it resulted in timely air <b>bag</b> <b>deployment</b> for frontal crashes, including pole, underride, oblique and oVset crashes. Moreover, it is proposed that an accelerometer be installed on each side of the rockers or pillars to assess the crash severity of each side and to deploy driver and passenger air bags at diVerent times, especially during an asymmetric crash such as an oblique and an oVset crash. As an example, the deceleration signals measured at the left and right B-pillar/rocker locations were processed through the algorithm, and earlier time-to-res (TTFs) were obtained for the air bag on the struck side than for the air bag on the non-struck side...|$|R

50|$|A {{static line}} is a cord {{attached}} at {{one end to the}} aircraft and at the other end {{to the top of the}} jumper's 'D-Bag' (<b>Deployment</b> <b>Bag,</b> into which the canopy is packed). The parachutist's fall from the aircraft causes the static line to become taut, this then pulls the D-Bag out of the container on the jumper's back. The static line and D-Bag stay with the aircraft as the jumper leaves, and is pulled back into the aircraft by the dispatcher. Now free of its D-Bag, the canopy is allowed to inflate as the jumper continues to fall. Effectively, the jumper drags the parachute behind him, causing the upward-rushing wind to force open and inflate the canopy. The canopy should inflate and begin supporting the jumper within 4 seconds. In the unlikely event of a malfunction, students are taught how to cut away the main canopy and deploy the reserve chute. The aim of static line progression is to train students to maintain the correct, stable body position upon exiting the aircraft, and to teach how to deploy the canopy via the pilot chute mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|Activation {{begins when}} the pilot-chute is thrown out. It inflates and creates drag, pulling the pin {{out of the}} closing loop and {{allowing}} the pilot-chute to pull the <b>deployment</b> <b>bag</b> from the container. The parachute lines are pulled loose from the rubber bands and extend as the canopy starts to open. A rectangular piece of fabric called the [...] "slider" [...] (which separates the parachute lines into four main groups fed through grommets in the four respective corners of the slider) slows {{the opening of the}} parachute and works its way down until the canopy is fully open and the slider is just above the head of the skydiver. The slider slows and controls the deployment of the parachute. Without a slider, the parachute would inflate fast, potentially damaging the parachute fabric and/or suspension lines, as well as causing discomfort, injury or even death of the jumper. During a normal deployment, a skydiver will generally experience a few seconds of intense deceleration, in the realm of 3 to 4 g, while the parachute slows the descent from 190 km/h to approximately 28 km/h (17 mph).|$|E
5000|$|At an {{altitude}} of 600 m, having been in free-fall for at least 300 m, a skydiver is falling at approximately 55 m/s, and is approximately 10.9 seconds from the ground. Most BASE jumps are made from less than 600 m. For example, a BASE jump from a 150 m object is about 5.6 seconds from the ground if the jumper remains in free fall. On a BASE jump, the parachute must open at about half the airspeed of a similar skydive, and more quickly (in a shorter distance fallen). Standard skydiving parachute systems are not designed for this situation, so BASE jumpers often use specially designed harnesses and parachute containers, with extra large pilot chutes, and many jump with only one parachute, since {{there would be little}} time to utilize a reserve parachute. In the early days of BASE jumping, people used modified skydiving gear, such as by removing the <b>deployment</b> <b>bag</b> and slider, stowing the lines in a tail pocket, and fitting a large pilot chute. However, modified skydiving gear is then prone to kinds of malfunction that are rare in normal skydiving (such as [...] "line-overs" [...] and broken lines). Modern purpose-built BASE jumping equipment is considered to be much safer and more reliable.|$|E
40|$|Air bags, {{fitted in}} the {{majority}} of new automobiles, are safety devices activated when a sudden deceleration causes the ignition of a propellant cartridge containing sodium azide. The bag is inflated by nitrogen liberated during the combustion. Deployment releases various high-temperature gases, including nitrogen and carbon dioxide, and produces sodium hydroxide, a highly irritant alkaline substance. In about 7 %- 8 % of cases, air bags cause dermatologic injuries such as traumatic lesions, irritant dermatitis, and chemical and thermal burns.
