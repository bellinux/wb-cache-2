5|$|Dunder Mifflin's {{tech support}} employee, Sadiq (Omi Vaidya), {{arrives at the}} Scranton branch {{to set up a}} system that allows Michael Scott (Steve Carell) to monitor his employees' emails. When {{everyone}} in the office finds out, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) worries that Michael will discover the party he <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> that night, to which Michael is not invited. Inevitably, Michael notices and tries to get Jim to admit that he's having a party, while Jim acts nonchalantly as if nothing is happening. In order to keep Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) from exposing the party, Jim tells him that it is a surprise party for Michael.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{from the}} Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin, Josh Porter (Charles Esten) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) from the Stamford branch, and Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) from the {{corporate}} headquarters all descend upon Philadelphia for an office supply convention. Michael is bitter that Jim left Scranton for Stamford {{and tries to}} one-up Josh at every opportunity. Michael also spreads the word that he <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> a party {{in his hotel room}} that night. Later in the evening, Michael surprises everyone with the news that he has broken Staples's exclusive hold on Hammermill products.|$|E
5|$|Shepard and Kasumi {{travel to}} the planet Bekenstein, where Hock <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> a party at his mansion {{for some of the}} galaxy's richest people. After getting samples of Hock's DNA from his private quarters, {{recording}} a sample of his voice, and disabling the vault's defenses, Kasumi and Shepard infiltrate the vault. As Kasumi starts cracking the graybox, the pair is detected and attacked by Hock's forces. Kasumi and Shepard eventually manage to escape in a shuttle after destroying a gunship piloted by Hock. After the mission, Kasumi accesses the graybox and sees her partner one last time. A hologram of Okuda reveals the data, saying that it would impact humanity's reputation if made public. He begs her to destroy the data along with his memories. Kasumi has trouble letting him go, showing that their relationship was much more than professional. Shepard can persuade Kasumi to follow Keiji's wishes or keep the data.|$|E

5|$|To defeat enemies, {{the player}} can use both regular and special attacks. The latter use up Special Attack Stars; the player starts {{the game with}} three, and can gain more {{throughout}} the game, which carry over between areas. The types of attacks and stats such as attack power and agility differ depending on the character: Jack Frost's standard attack <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> snowballs, Jack Lantern's is shooting fire balls, while Jack Skelton uses his knife. Their special attacks are, respectively, freezing all enemies for a few seconds; dealing {{a large amount of}} damage to all enemies; and defeating all enemies that are visible on the screen. As the player explores the floors, they need to avoid being attacked by enemies or falling into traps: each time this happens, the remaining time limit decreases by five seconds. If the timer reaches zero, the player reaches a game over state, although they are given the option to restart {{from the beginning of the}} current area.|$|E
5|$|Jigsaw then leads Tapp to the asylum's crematorium, {{where he}} informs Tapp {{that some people}} {{actually}} desire his tests, much to Tapp's surprise. At the crematorium is Obi Tate, an arsonist who had put advertisements in the newspaper seeking for Jigsaw to test him. Tapp saves him from a burning furnace, but Obi is still frustrated {{because he wanted to}} survive his own test. Feeling that Tapp <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> away a gift from Jigsaw, Obi runs away. Tapp then ventures through a theater, where he finds evidence that a former Jigsaw victim being held there. He soon finds that it is Jeff Thomas, the man who was saved by Sing while he and Tapp were in Jigsaw's lair. Jeff has since become suicidal from Tapp's incessant questioning, and has been recaptured by Jigsaw. Tapp saves Thomas from a wall of spikes. Thomas is still frustrated, so he runs away, wounded. As this was the last victim in the asylum, Tapp is free to pursue Jigsaw, but encounters Pighead again. Jigsaw informs Tapp that Pighead wishes to surpass Jigsaw and sabotage Tapp's game, so he must be stopped. Tapp confronts and kills Pighead; Jigsaw rhetorically asks him if he's a murderer, {{in order to get a}} key to proceed.|$|E
25|$|The {{first ever}} extra-solar auroras were {{discovered}} in July 2015 over the brown dwarf star LSR J1835+3259. The mainly red aurora {{was found to be}} a million times brighter than the Northern Lights, a result of the charged particles interacting with hydrogen in the atmosphere. It has been speculated that stellar winds may be stripping off material {{from the surface of the}} brown dwarf to produce its own electrons. Another possible explanation for the auroras is that an as-yet-undetected body around the dwarf star <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> off material, as is the case with Jupiter and its moon Io.|$|E
5000|$|Many tricks or {{patterns}} are generated from mixing cascade and reverse cascade throws. For example, tennis (siteswap: 3) one ball <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> over (reverse) {{while the other}} two <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> under (inside). One juggles, [...] "a cascade with two balls while the 'tennis' ball <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> {{and forth over the}} top." ...|$|R

25|$|There {{was much}} comment in the Press box {{as to the}} {{legitimacy}} of this delivery but Meckiff certainly generated {{a considerable amount of}} pace. It is always difficult to assess exactly whether a bowler <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> and it is something of which one must be sure before being too dogmatic. Once a bowler is condemned for throwing his career is finished and it is a great step to take by any umpire, especially so in a Test match...he certainly looks very much like a thrower. The umpires, however, are satisfied that he is all right and they are the judges.|$|E
25|$|Chapter Six – Pig and Pepper: A Fish-Footman has an {{invitation}} for the Duchess of the house, which he delivers to a Frog-Footman. Alice observes this transaction and, after a perplexing conversation with the frog, lets herself into the house. The Duchess's Cook <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> dishes and making a soup that has too much pepper, which causes Alice, the Duchess, and her baby (but not the cook or grinning Cheshire Cat) to sneeze violently. Alice is given the baby by the Duchess and to her surprise, the baby turns into a pig. The Cheshire Cat appears in a tree, directing her to the March Hare's house. He disappears, but his grin remains behind to float on its own in the air, prompting Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat.|$|E
25|$|In combat, Frodo {{has access}} to three melee weapons at {{different}} stages in the game. Initially, he is armed with a walking stick. Later, he acquires a dagger, and finally, he can use the short sword Sting. Frodo can also throw stones, and can turn invisible for limited periods of time by using the One Ring. Aragorn is initially armed with a basic longsword, but later acquires Andúril. He also possesses a bow, and he can kick out at enemies. Gandalf uses his sword Glamdring and has several magical abilities, such as a fire attack, chain lightning and healing. The player can also switch to first-person view {{at any time during}} the game. This can help targeting when Frodo <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> stones or Aragorn is firing arrows. Movement during first-person view is limited to strafing left and right.|$|E
50|$|In ancient Rome, {{executed}} criminals <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> {{into the}} Tiber. People executed at the Gemonian stairs <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> in the Tiber during the later {{part of the}} reign of the emperor Tiberius. This practice continued over the centuries. For example, the corpse of Pope Formosus <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> into the Tiber after the infamous Cadaver Synod held in 897.|$|R

500|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, the company tech support employee gives Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{the ability to read}} his employees' emails, causing him to find out that Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> a party that Michael was not invited to. Meanwhile, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) begins to suspect that Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) [...] might secretly be having a relationship.|$|E

[...] "Schumacher ought to face charges in a Spanish court for the grave deed he committed" [...] it reported. [...] "The driver covered himself, Ferrari and Italian sport as a whole with shame. We are waiting for Ferrari to announce that it <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> out Michael Schumacher and hiring a new driver who is more intelligent, has more wisdom and a real sense of morality." ...|$|E
500|$|Bumgarner's {{repertoire}} {{consists of}} four pitches including a curveball he throws at two different speeds with {{two different types of}} movement. He features a four-seam fastball in the [...] range that tops off at 95mph, a cutter around , a curveball that usually ranges from [...] with sharp, mostly downward break, but he occasionally throws a much slower curve with a more exaggerated and horizontal break in the mid-to-high 60 miles per hour range, and a change-up that sits at [...] The fastball and cutter are his main pitches; through 2013, he has thrown the fastball 43.68% of the time and the cutter 33.84% of the time. Madison has a unique pitching style. As he throws, it appears he <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> toward first base.|$|E

50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the 540 crescent, a crescent 540 is where a crescent kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> out with one leg before the 540 kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> with the other, essentially executing two separate kicks during the same motion. A slight variation of this is where the crescent kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> as a sideways snap kick, followed by a round house kick. The hips must be rotated more before the kicks <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> and the body tilts in the direction of the kicks, which can cause a person to lose their balance on the landing.|$|R
500|$|Meanwhile, Kenneth <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> his rule-filled [...] "Secret Santa Fun Swap", {{much to the}} writers' chagrin. Frank, Toofer, and Lutz {{proclaim}} {{they are}} strict adherents of [...] "Verdukianism," [...] a religion they make up on the spot, and have Kenneth give them things they claim to need for [...] "Merlinpeen," [...] the Verdukian Holiday of Mouth Pleasures (such as meat-lover's pizza and having their teeth flossed by a blonde virgin). Their famous holiday song is, [...] "Oh, Meatbowl of Verduke, you bring me such pizza. Meatbowl." [...] When Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tells Kenneth that they made up their religion, he goes into shock {{at the idea that}} all religions are made up by man. His faith is restored when the three are arrested for the bomb threat Liz called in, using their phone.|$|E
500|$|... "Circles" [...] {{garnered}} mainly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Andrew Hampp of Billboard was very positive, calling it [...] "the biggest surprise on Lotus, and writing, [...] "'Circles' is Aguilera at her most unapologetic {{and all the}} more delightful for it". 4Music's Chris Younie wrote that, [...] "Aguilera <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> tonnes of attitude and sass our way". Digital Spy's Robert Cospey praised its lyrics, labelling it [...] "one of their immediate favourites". Caomhan Keane from the website entertainment.ie called it [...] "fun and delicious", while Entertainment Weekly critic Melissa Maerz called it a [...] "sassy kiss-off". Story Gilmore of Neon Limelight was very positive, commenting, [...] "As much as we love Xtina for her incredible voice, we also love her for her feisty personality. The tune is a brilliant mix of genres with a rockstar-worthy chorus". Popjustice writer Same Hine enjoyed the track {{and said that he}} liked it [...] "when Christina gets a bit wobbly and the bubblegum melody sounds oddly good with the lyrics", although it wasn't [...] "her finest pop moment". Mike Wass from Idolator wrote that the song [...] "sounds like fluffiest Nine Inch Nails song ever recorded", also commenting it as [...] "a total trainwreck, but there's something amusing about Xtina putting her haters in their place".|$|E
500|$|... "Candy Shop" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from music critics. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised it for capturing [...] "Pharrell Williams' flair for slim, sleek grooves" [...] and labelled it a highlight from Hard Candy. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone, {{noted that the}} [...] "creative tension between Madonna and the Neptunes' Pharrell Williams crackles on the innuendo-laden opener 'Candy Shop'". Writing for Idolator, Bradley Stern criticized the lyrics but praised its catchiness, [...] "set to a nice, punchy beat, Madonna weaves her voice around a hypnotic groove that practically dares you not to sing along. [...] is all about letting loose {{and having a good}} time". He also opined that while it wouldn't work as a single [...] "it more than serves its purpose as an introduction to Hard Candy". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote, [...] "Pharrell makes his presence known a little too much [...] he manages to get Madonna to stretch vocally in ways she hasn't since Evita. That is, when she's not doing cheeky drag queen impersonations, with trannie-fierce moments sprinkled liberally throughout 'Candy Shop' (“My sugar is raw”) [...] The song is neither sexy nor campy, and somewhere, Dita <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> her head back, laughing hysterically, and cracking her whip in disapproval", the last part being a reference to the alter ego Madonna incorporated for her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992).|$|E

5000|$|A given juggling {{pattern is}} {{represented}} by a sequence of digits, like [...] "333", [...] "97531", or [...] "744". Each digit represents the number of throws that occur {{by the time that}} same prop will be caught. For example, [...] "333" [...] represents a common three-ball cascade, where three props <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> before the same prop will <b>be</b> caught and <b>thrown</b> again. Within the [...] "531531" [...] pattern, the prop thrown first, the '5' <b>throw,</b> will not <b>be</b> caught until five <b>throws</b> have <b>been</b> made, including itself, where it will <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> again as a '1'. The prop thrown next, the '3', will <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> again on the third throw afterwards, the next '3'. And the next prop <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> with a '1' <b>throw,</b> which <b>is</b> a direct pass to the other hand and will <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> on the very next throw as a '5'.|$|R
5000|$|Six no-hitters <b>were</b> <b>thrown.</b> They <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> by Ubaldo Jiménez (April 17), Dallas Braden (May 9), Roy Halladay (May 29), Edwin Jackson (June 25), Matt Garza (July 26), and Halladay again, {{this time}} in Game 1 of the NLDS.

Hassan, {{one of the}} notable characters {{of the book and}} [...] "a notorious liquefactionist", <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> a violent orgy. AJ crashes the party and wreaks havoc, decapitating people and imitating a pirate. Hassan is enraged and tells AJ never to return, calling him a [...] "factualist bitch", a term which is enlarged much later when the apparently [...] "clashing" [...] political factions within Interzone are described. These include the Liquefactionists, the Senders, the Factualists, and the Divisionists (who occupy [...] "a midway position"). A short descriptive section tells of Interzone University, where a professor and his students are ridiculed; the book moves on to an orgy that AJ throws.|$|E
