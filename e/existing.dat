This will make the stadium bowl-shaped and will increase its capacity to around 80,000. It will resolve the <b>existing</b> problems of deteriorating concrete quality on the old structure in the north stand.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, DC-10 and L-1011 models were {{approaching}} retirement age, prompting manufacturers to develop replacement designs. McDonnell Douglas {{was working on}} the MD-11, a stretched and upgraded successor of the DC-10, while Airbus was developing its A330 and A340. In 1986, Boeing unveiled proposals for an enlarged 767, tentatively named 767-X, to target the replacement market for first-generation wide-bodies such as the DC-10, and to complement <b>existing</b> 767 and 747 models in the company lineup. The initial proposal featured a longer fuselage and larger wings than the <b>existing</b> 767, along with winglets. Later plans expanded the fuselage cross-section but retained the <b>existing</b> 767 flight deck, nose, and other elements.|$|E
5|$|Describing {{the choice}} of {{developing}} a game based on the <b>existing</b> White Wolf property over creating their own, Boyarsky said that although an original property lacked the constraints of an <b>existing</b> one, the downside was {{that it had not}} been tested and could be rejected by its potential audience; an <b>existing</b> property was proven. Troika tried to stay {{as close as possible to}} the White Wolf rules, while reducing the number of abilities and disciplines to those relevant to Bloodlines gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Finally, Putnam's {{internal}} realism {{has been}} accused by Curtis Brown of being a disguised form of subjective idealism. If this is the case, it {{is subject to the}} traditional arguments against that position. In particular, it falls into the trap of solipsism. That is, if existence depends on experience, as subjective idealism maintains, and if one's consciousness were to stop <b>existing,</b> then the rest of the universe would stop <b>existing</b> as well.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{review of}} {{parliamentary}} representation in Greater Manchester, the Boundary Commission for England recommended that Eccles be split between two new constituencies; Salford and Eccles, from the <b>existing</b> Salford constituency and the central/eastern part of Eccles, and Worsley and Eccles South, from the <b>existing</b> Worsley constituency and the southern/western part of Eccles.|$|E

5|$|The Congressional Research Service (CRS) {{estimated}} that shutting down VH-71 production, upgrading the <b>existing</b> fleet, and later implementing a successor program would cost $14–$21billion. It was reported {{not only that}} a new fleet would not be available until 2024 (at which point the <b>existing</b> helicopters would have remained in service while being over 50 years old), but that terminating the <b>existing</b> program would waste more than $3billion in sunk VH-71 costs.

5|$|There {{were two}} <b>existing</b> fortifications in this location. The main <b>existing</b> fort, King Charles's Castle, {{had been built}} in the 1550s but was poorly sited and had been blown up by its {{defenders}} when Blake's forces took the island.
