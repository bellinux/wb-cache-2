50|$|Hunted {{throughout}} its range, a single <b>giant</b> <b>armadillo</b> supplies {{a great deal}} of meat, and is the primary source of protein for some indigenous peoples. In addition, live <b>giant</b> <b>armadillos</b> are frequently captured for trade on the black market, and invariably die during transportation or in captivity. Despite this species’ wide range, it is locally rare. This is further exacerbated by habitat loss resulting from deforestation. Current estimates indicate the <b>giant</b> <b>armadillo</b> may have undergone a worrying population decline of 30 to 50 percent over the past three decades. Without intervention, this trend is likely to continue.|$|R

50|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>armadillos</b> {{use their}} large front claws to dig for prey and rip open termite mounds. The diet is mainly {{composed}} of termites, although ants, worms, spiders and other invertebrates are also eaten. Little is currently {{known about this}} species' reproductive biology, and no juveniles have ever been discovered in the field. The average sleep time of a captive <b>giant</b> <b>armadillo</b> {{is said to be}} 18.1 hours.|$|R

40|$|The diel of the <b>giant</b> <b>armadillo</b> - Priodontes maximus (Kerr, 1792) - was {{studied in}} the field at Fazenda São Miguel, Unaí, Minas Gerais, Brazil, through 82 samples {{collected}} at foraging excavations and 25 fecal samples. In both types of sample the most common item was insects (Isoptera e Hymenoptera) and, in less quantity, plant fragments and orhers invertebrates (Aranae, Blattaria, Coleoptera, Diplopoda, Scorpiones). These data suggest the <b>giant</b> <b>armadillo</b> is a specialist on insects with an opportunistic foraging strategy...|$|R

50|$|Female <b>giant</b> <b>armadillos</b> {{have two}} teats and {{are thought to}} {{normally}} give birth to only a single young per year. Little is known with certainty about their life history, although {{it is thought that}} the young are weaned by about seven to eight months of age, and that the mother periodically seals up the entrance to burrows containing younger offspring, presumably to protect them from predators. Although they have never bred in captivity, a wild-born <b>giant</b> <b>armadillo</b> at San Antonio Zoo was estimated to have been around sixteen years old when it died.|$|R
