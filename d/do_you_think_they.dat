6000|$|... "When I joined Miss Wyvil and Mr. Morris," [...] he began, [...] "what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> were doing? They {{were talking}} of--Miss Jethro." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and how quick <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{would let}} me go, if I did? I'm an honest working-girl, and I can't afford to lose jobs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{will find}} us soon?" [...] asked Rob, {{who found the}} shadowy glen rather dull, and began to long for more society.|$|E
5000|$|On {{their return}} to a justifiably proud Vancouver, someone in the crowd asked Read, [...] "When <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> were going to win?" [...] Read's reply, [...] "When they left the boathouse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it's Christmas Day," [...] Harold said, stretching. [...] "Well, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Peter--are <b>they</b> {{likely to}} come back or not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{march in}} very good order, Ned; <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> would keep up such {{discipline}} as that after they had mutinied?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} you, Miles," [...] Marble answered, in {{a thoughtful}} manner; [...] "we {{must be on}} our guard. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> mean to come below?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Lawford put the {{candlestick}} {{down on the}} table. 'There's {{only one}} thing,' he said, watching his visitor's rummaging; 'what precisely <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> will do with me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> will be coming, Bill?" [...] Betsy Nibson said, as {{she joined}} her husband, who was {{standing}} on the bank dressed in his Sunday clothes.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{spoke as}} though {{something}} {{might have happened}} to him here," [...] the girl whispered. [...] "Oh! it is too horrible, this! What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> meant?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> meant?" [...] cried De Catinat impatiently. [...] "For heaven's sake, let us {{come to some}} conclusion, {{for every}} minute is of importance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, sir," [...] he said, raising his hat. [...] "I am {{just back from}} Australia--haven't seen a wedding in England for fifty years. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> would let me into the church?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Learn {{to subdue}} yourself, young man," [...] he muttered sternly. [...] "If these pirates hear laughter, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{can be made}} to believe we are afraid of them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{hope not}} severely. But {{you have heard}} nothing. They have sent his Intendant to Jerusalem with a guard of Arabs to bring back his ransom. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> want?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{what time}} <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> will arrive here?" [...] the colonel asked, when Jake {{had made his}} report. [...] "Dey be pretty close by dark, for sure," [...] Jake replied.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing {{between you}} and me!" [...] she {{repeated}} with a ring of gentle scorn in her voice. [...] "Bernard, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know so little of women, after all? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> can play at love in this give-and-take fashion?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{leaving me}} apart, Rupert; <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> the {{children}} are better, richer, happier, for all this knowledge; <b>do</b> <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> <b>they</b> are? Or is it better to leave them untouched, spontaneous. Hadn't they better be animals, simple animals, crude, violent, ANYTHING, rather than this self-consciousness, this incapacity to be spontaneous.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, really!' cried Mr. Pickwick, with {{manifest}} pleasure. 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{care about}} my gaiters? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> seriously <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> identify {{me at all}} with my gaiters?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} very likely she is," [...] said Rollo. [...] "But, uncle George, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> have got down below? I've a great mind {{to go down}} and see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} would be kinder to do it for once. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> will do as they grow older, if you don't keep them in order when they are little?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish there}} were a thousand, as {{we are about to}} lift the deck from the ship, and send them all into the air. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> can {{understand}} what I say, Miles?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It sank now, and {{the boys}} lowered it five or six feet, {{so that they could}} partly see into it. [...] "There are lots of little fish {{swimming}} about, Tom," [...] Peter said in a whisper. [...] "Some are almost as long as one's hand. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> will go in, Tom?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{leaned back}} {{again in the}} chair and let her hands rest quietly in her lap. [...] "Would you have {{preferred}} me to remain outside, in the yacht, in the near neighbourhood of these wild men who captured <b>you?</b> Or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they,</b> too, were got up to carry on a farce?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As if {{we should}} wait to be starved," [...] another of the {{students}} said scoffingly. [...] "If the time comes when there's nothing to eat, we would set Paris on fire and hurl ourselves every man upon the Germans, and fight our way through. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> could block every road round Paris?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Congress or Virginia," [...] said he, [...] "will {{have to pay}} Monsieur Vigo, and Father Gibault, and Monsieur Gratiot, and {{the other}} good people who have trusted me. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> will do so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Do you {{remember}} those Englishmen, the fellows who robbed Mr. Borden? Well, we traced {{them to their}} camp, and what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> <b>They</b> met Jasniff in some way, and he is friendly with them.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{mean to do}} with us, Luka?" [...] Godfrey asked. [...] "Will they hand us over to the Russians, do you think? Cowardly blackguards. I wish now we {{had fought}} at first." ...|$|E
6000|$|Old Sharon, to all appearance, {{dropped the}} subject there. He lifted his lean brown {{forefinger}} and pointed again--this {{time to a}} house at {{a short distance from}} them. [...] "That's a farmhouse, surely?" [...] he said. [...] "I'm thirsty after my roll down the hill. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Miss, <b>they</b> would give me a drink of milk?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And on {{the tone}} of the Nobles--do not <b>you</b> <b>think</b> so?" [...] said Lady Maud. [...] "I know it is the fashion to deride the crusades, but <b>do</b> not <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> had their origin in a great impulse, and in a certain sense, led to great results? Pardon me, if I speak with emphasis, but I never can forget I am a {{daughter}} of the first crusaders." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Gentlemen of the jury: You heard {{with what}} cold cruelty the {{prosecution}} {{referred to the}} sins of this woman, as if her condition were of her own preference. The evidence has painted you {{a picture of her}} life and surroundings. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> were embraced of her own choosing? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that she willingly embraced a life so revolting and horrible? Ah, no! Gentlemen, one of our own sex was the author of her ruin, more to blame than she.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say!" [...] he began, [...] "we must part friends, you know--or I shall {{break my}} heart over it. They have got milk at the farmhouse. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> have got pen, ink, and paper too?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear!" [...] cried Flora presently, jumping up, [...] "what are you doing? {{piling up}} those heavy {{books on the}} top of the little ones; how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> will ever stand? let me do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And after all," [...] {{the young}} lady went on, [...] "here {{we are at the}} end of it very much as though it had never happened. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> will be able to stop wars in the future?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, we meant it; the {{struggle}} with us {{was to get}} to the front. Why, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know, I heard two or three of the National Guard grumbling in the highest state of indignation, and why, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> Because <b>they</b> had to sleep in the open air last night. Are these the men to defend a city? There will be trouble before long, Cuthbert. The workmen will not stand it; they have no faith in the Government nor in Trochu, nor in any one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{it as you}} like, Colonel O'Connor. However, your {{regiment}} will {{be placed}} in orders, today, as {{an exception to the}} severe censure passed upon the troops who entered the town last night. And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> will behave better, another time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'd find {{it easier}} to be bad than good if you had red hair," [...] said Anne reproachfully. [...] "People who haven't red hair don't know what trouble is. Mrs. Thomas told me that God made my hair red ON PURPOSE, and I've never cared about Him since. And anyhow I'd always be too tired at night to bother saying prayers. People who have to look after twins can't be {{expected}} to say their prayers. Now, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> honestly <b>think</b> <b>they</b> can?" ...|$|R
