500|$|On January 6, 2016, Fantasia {{announced}} on Instagram that [...] "No Time for It" [...] {{would be the}} lead single from The Definition Of... and unveiled its cover: [...] "This month my new single will be born and I’m speaking nothing but the truth". The following day, the song premiered on Fantasia’s Vevo channel, and explicit and clean versions were digitally released at the iTunes Store. It was Fantasia's first release after joining Primary Wave Music. According to the singer, [...] "No Time for It" [...] was chosen by her label as the album's first single. She was initially hesitant about releasing the song ("At <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thinking, 'Is that a record to come back with?), but she later said that it [...] "set the atmosphere" [...] for her future singles. Fantasia was critical of the single, describing it as a [...] "very cute record", but felt connected to its message. She had favored [...] "Sleeping with the One I Love" [...] (2016) as the album's lead single. According to the singer, she would not record anything without feeling a personal connection and the album's recording process was all about [...] "artistic fulfillment". Jourdan Miller of BreatheHeavy called the single's release [...] "perfectly timed seeing how the singing reality competition {{is on its way}} out, cause we all have no time for it".|$|E
500|$|Of the {{starring}} cast, Pryce, Hurt, Redgrave and Tutin {{were already}} established screen actors, while Ayola had previously only acted theatrically. She appraised of her screen debut: [...] "it {{was a wonderful}} experience {{for me to be}} appearing alongside so many established names. It was very exciting although I must admit at <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a bit daunted by the prospect." [...] The film featured several minor black characters, either as members of Gabriel's family, or as workers aboard the ship. When these roles were cast, complaints were made by black members of the British actors' union to the BBC and the Department of Employment at having been [...] "passed over" [...] in favour of overseas artists. The film was shot from 23 September to 6 November 1992. It was funded in the most part by the BBC, though a quarter of the budget came from the American Miramax. While Kidron had previously come to dislike directing for major studios when filming My Cousin Vinny for Fox, she found the low budget of Great Moments in Aviation [...] "just as horrendous a compromise". Though originally intended for theatrical release, the film failed to find theatrical distribution. It was first screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 1994, then broadcast in Britain on BBC Two on 11 November 1995. It was released on video in the United States under the alternate title Shades of Fear two years later, on 11 November 1997.|$|E
500|$|In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull, a post he held {{until his}} death. Professor R.L. Brett, who was {{chairman}} of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, [...] "At <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> impressed with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again." [...] For his first year he lodged in bedsits. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a self-contained flat on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate. This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem High Windows. Of the city itself Larkin commented: [...] "I never thought about Hull until I was here. Having got here, it suits me in many ways. It is a little on the edge of things, I think even its natives would say that. I rather like being on the edge of things. One doesn't really go anywhere by design, you know, you put in for jobs and move about, you know, I've lived in other places." [...] In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after Sir Brynmor Jones, the university's vice-chancellor.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} by {{television}} critics were positive, with Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club calling it [...] "an episode of Family Guy that rewards every viewer who liked the show in the past." [...] McFarland also gave high praise to the episode, writing, [...] "At <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> simply pleased that 'Back to the Pilot' didn't screw things up at the beginning, but as the episode went, I kept looking at the clock and being amazed that it hadn't dropped the ball yet. It used short cutaways and a plethora of self-referential jokes the writers must have stockpiled for years about the animation quality, voice quality, {{and structure of the}} pilot to every possible advantage." [...] He continued, [...] "It wasn't perfect {{by any stretch of the}} imagination, and it's not on the same level as the occasional brilliance that South Park reaches on about one occasion per season nowadays, but it's the most fun I've had watching the show that didn't involve a Star Wars parody in many years." [...] McFarland concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of A-. Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also enjoyed the episode, noting, [...] "'Back to the Pilot' was a great meta episode of Family Guy. From poking fun at its own flaws in the original series to acknowledging how silly the cutaway gags can be, Family Guy shone at its layered best tonight." [...] She continued, [...] "Treating its animated characters like real actors was a nice touch as well. [...] Watching the original family showed how much the characters evolved and changed throughout the series' long run." [...] Moon concluded her review by giving the episode a 4.2 out of 5. Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number two on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "pure genius". He added, [...] "Not only was the episode hilarious with amazing Brian and Stewie moments, but it was genuinely quite clever in the time-travel stakes, which is impressive on a nerd level." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by film-maker Brett Ratner in Los Angeles, and features a cameo appearance from 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer. Prior to filming the video, or releasing the single, Carey had toned her body, and lost a reported twenty pounds. Due to her slim-down, she and Ratner wanted to flaunt Carey's new figure {{as much as possible}} throughout the video: [...] "Mariah looks better than she has ever looked. It's ridiculous. Mariah has an incredible body, but she was always kind of very voluptuous. Now she's just like, fit. And we were like, we've got to show this body." [...] As the pair came up with the video's plot, Ratner contacted McBrayer to play a male leading role, alongside Carey. After receiving the call, McBrayer claimed he was so shocked by the proposal, that he didn't believe it at first. He only met with the producers after Ratner personally called him and assured him the authenticity of the offer. In an interview with MTV News, McBrayer joked [...] "I'm always worried now that somebody is pranking me, so at <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very leery. But when I heard it was legit, and then later on we {{got a phone call from}} Brett Ratner, who directed it. I was like, 'This is either a very elaborate prank, or this is the real deal.'" [...] In the fantasy-themed story, he recalled what he considered the video's most memorable scene, in which he and Carey, dressed in medieval attire, were walking with a unicorn. Additionally, he described the filming process as very simple, as they were given very loose directions and pointers. McBrayer claimed that during one take, they were meant to play Frisbee on the mansion lawn, and he accidentally threw it at Carey's face, jokingly adding [...] "by the time she spins back around — bonk, right in her face. I threw a Frisbee in Mariah Carey's face! I'm like, I'm fired!." [...] When questioned by critics regarding the song and video, Carey responded [...] "Have you seen the 'Touch My Body' video? C'mon. Clearly you must see the humour in that. Even the lyrics, 'I will hunt you down'. If anyone doesn't get the joke by this time then they are an idiot." [...] In an interview with Reuters, Carey described working with Ratner, and her experience filming the video: ...|$|E
