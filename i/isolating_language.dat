5|$|Khmer is {{primarily}} an analytic, <b>isolating</b> <b>language.</b> There are no inflections, conjugations or case endings. Instead, particles and auxiliary words {{are used to}} indicate grammatical relationships. General word order is subject–verb–object, and modifiers follow the word they modify. Classifiers appear after numbers when used to count nouns, though not always so consistently as in languages like Chinese. In spoken Khmer, topic-comment structure is common and the perceived social relation between participants determines which sets of vocabulary, such as pronouns and honorifics, are proper.|$|E

25|$|Chinese {{is a very}} {{analytic}} or <b>isolating</b> <b>language,</b> having {{almost no}} inflectional morphemes. It follows a similar sentence structure to English, frequently forming sentences in the order subject-predicate. The predicate can be an intransitive verb, a transitive verb followed by a direct object, a linking verb followed by a predicate nominative, etc.|$|E
500|$|Modern Khmer is an <b>isolating</b> <b>language,</b> {{which means}} that it uses little {{productive}} morphology. There is some derivation by means of prefixes and infixes, {{but this is a}} remnant of Old Khmer and not always productive in the modern language. Khmer morphology is evidence of a historical process through which [...] the language was, {{at some point in the}} past, changed from being an agglutinative language to adopting an isolating typology. Affixed forms are lexicalized and cannot be used productively to form new words. Below are some of the most common affixes with examples as given by Huffman.|$|E

50|$|Some {{problems}} {{encountered by}} the genetic relationship group of <b>languages</b> include <b>language</b> <b>isolates,</b> and mixed, pidgin, and creole languages. Mixed languages, pidgins and creole languages constitute special genetic types of languages. They do not descend linearly or {{directly from a}} single language and have no single ancestor. <b>Language</b> <b>isolates</b> are <b>languages</b> that are unrelated to other <b>languages.</b> Each <b>language</b> <b>isolate</b> {{is considered to be}} a single language family with one language according to the Ethnologue.

2500|$|Kanbun, {{literally}} [...] "Chinese writing," [...] {{refers to}} a genre of techniques for making Chinese texts read like Japanese, or for writing in a way imitative of Chinese. For a Japanese, neither of these tasks could be accomplished easily because of the two languages' different structures. As I have mentioned, Chinese is an <b>isolating</b> <b>language.</b> Its grammatical relations are identified in subject–verb–object (SVO) order and {{through the use of}} particles similar to English prepositions. Inflection plays no role in the grammar. Morphemes are typically one syllable in length and combine to form words without modification to their phonetic structures (tone excepted). Conversely, the basic structure of a transitive Japanese sentence is SOV, with the usual syntactic features associated with languages of this typology, including post positions, that is, grammar particles that appear after the words and phrases to which they apply.

50|$|An <b>isolating</b> <b>{{language}}</b> {{is a type}} {{of language}} with a very low morpheme per word ratio and no inflectional morphology whatsoever.

50|$|Agglutinative {{languages}} are often contrasted both with languages in which syntactic structure is expressed solely {{by means of}} word order and auxiliary words (<b>isolating</b> <b>languages)</b> and with languages in which a single affix typically expresses several syntactic categories and a single category may be expressed by several different affixes (as {{is the case in}} inflectional (fusional) languages). However, both fusional and <b>isolating</b> <b>languages</b> may use agglutination in the most-often-used constructs, and use agglutination heavily in certain contexts, such as word derivation. This is the case in English, which has an agglutinated plural marker -(e)s and derived words such as shame·less·ness.|$|R

50|$|Obligatory plural marking of all nouns {{is found}} {{throughout}} western and northern Eurasia {{and in most}} parts of Africa. The rest of the world presents a heterogeneous picture. Optional plural marking is particularly common in Southeast and East Asia and Australia, and complete lack of plural marking is particularly found in New Guinea and Australia. In addition to the areal correlations, there also seems to be at least one correlation with morphological typology: <b>isolating</b> <b>languages</b> appear to favor no or non-obligatory plural marking. This can be seen particularly in Africa, where optionality or absence of plural marking is found particularly in the <b>isolating</b> <b>languages</b> of West Africa.|$|R
