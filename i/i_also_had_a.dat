2500|$|A {{month in}} advance of the 2011 World Cup in March, Sangakkara decided that he would resign the {{captaincy}} after the tournament. Sri Lanka reached the final of the tournament. Throughout the tournament Sangakkara was in prolific form with the bat scoring 465 runs from 9 matches and was the third highest run-scorer behind team-mate Tillakaratne Dilshan and India's Sachin Tendulkar. Days after guiding Sri Lanka to the finals of the World Cup, Sangakkara announced to the public he was stepping down as captain of the T20 and ODI teams. He offered to continue as Test captain if deemed necessary for transition to new skipper, but Dilshan was appointed captain across all formats. Reflecting on the decision afterwards, he said that [...] "captaining Sri Lanka is a job that ages you very quickly... It's rarely a job you will last long in... <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> two-year stint, and I enjoyed it at times, certainly on the field where our results showed we were one of the top two sides in the world for one-and-a-half years, especially in the shorter form of the game." ...|$|E

60|$|I argued my {{proficiency}} so {{well that}} he did not refer to the matter again till Saturday, when he suggested removing one whole cloth from the after leech. I guess it was the disappointment written on my face that made him desist; for <b>I,</b> <b>also,</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> pride in my boat- sailing abilities, and I was almost wild to get out alone with the big sail and go tearing down the Carquinez Straits {{in the wake of the}} flying Greek.|$|E

60|$|For {{an endless}} period, {{as it seemed}} to me, I lay with {{my head on the}} thwart {{watching}} the schooner (she was a little ship, schooner-rigged fore and aft) come up out of the sea. She kept tacking to and fro in a widening compass, for she was sailing dead into the wind. It never entered my head to attempt to attract attention, and I do not remember anything distinctly after the sight of her side until I found myself in a little cabin aft. There's a dim half-memory of being lifted up to the gangway, and of a big round countenance covered with freckles and surrounded with red hair staring at me over the bulwarks. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> disconnected impression of a dark face, with extraordinary eyes, close to mine; but that I thought was a nightmare, until I met it again. I fancy I recollect some stuff being poured in between my teeth; and that is all.|$|E

[...] "If it was not known in Jamaica that she was carrying that gold, I wasn't going to tell it; for {{there are as many}} black-hearted scoundrels here as in any other part of the world! But I told the Beaver & Hughes people that <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> message for Captain Hagar, and that a friend of mine was coming to Kingston in a yacht, and that if he arrived soon I hadn't a doubt that we could overhaul the Dunkery Beacon, and give the Captain my message and the one from London besides, and that we'd try to do it, for it was very important. But they didn't know me, and they said they would wait until my friend's yacht should arrive, and then they would see about sending the message to Captain Hagar. Now, I've done enough talking, and we must do something!" ...|$|E
60|$|Perdita's {{mind was}} not {{softened}} by this account. He, she thought, {{can be great}} and happy without me. Would that <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> career! Would that I could freight some untried bark with all my hopes, energies, and desires, and launch it forth into the ocean of life--bound for some attainable point, with ambition or pleasure at the helm! But adverse winds detain me on shore; like Ulysses, I sit at the water's edge and weep. But my nerveless hands can neither fell the trees, nor smooth the planks. Under the influence of these melancholy thoughts, she became more than ever in love with sorrow. Yet Adrian's presence did some good; he at once broke through the law of silence observed concerning Raymond. At first she started from the unaccustomed sound; soon she {{got used to it}} and to love it, and she listened with avidity to the account of his achievements. Clara got rid also of her restraint; Adrian and she had been old playfellows; and now, as they walked or rode together, he yielded to her earnest entreaty, and repeated, for the hundredth time, some tale of her father's bravery, munificence, or justice.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{talk with}} the old gentleman about books. There were several large boxes of my books in New York which I had never sent out to my country house. Many of these I thought might be {{interesting}} to him, and I offered to have them taken out and left at his disposal. When he heard the titles {{of some of the}} books in the collection he was much interested, but insisted that before he made use of them they should be catalogued, as were the rest of my effects. I hesitated a moment, wondering if I could induce Barker to come to New York and catalogue four big boxes of books, when, to my surprise, Miss Vincent incidentally remarked that if they were in any place where she could get at them she would be pleased to help catalogue them; that sort of thing was a great pleasure to her. Instantly I proposed that I should send the books to the Vincent house, that they should there be taken out so that Mr. Vincent could select those he might care to read during the summer, that I would make a list of these, and if Vincent would assist me I would be grateful for the kindness, and those that were not desired could be returned to the storehouse.|$|E
6000|$|April, 1841.--. [...] . I {{have been}} busy all day, from early breakfast-time till {{late in the}} afternoon; and old Father Time has gone onward {{somewhat}} less heavily than is his wont when I am imprisoned {{within the walls of}} the Custom-House. It has been a brisk, breezy day, an effervescent atmosphere, and I have enjoyed it in all its freshness,--breathing air which had not been breathed in advance by the hundred thousand pairs of lungs which have common and indivisible property in the atmosphere of this great city. My breath had never belonged to anybody but me. It came fresh from the wilderness of ocean. [...] . It was exhilarating to see the vessels, how they bounded over the waves, while a sheet of foam broke out around them. I found a good deal of enjoyment, too, in the busy scene around me; for several vessels were disgorging themselves (what an unseemly figure is this,--"disgorge," [...] quotha, as if the vessels were sick) on the wharf, and everybody seemed to be working with might and main. It pleased me to think that <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> part to act in the material and tangible business of this life, and that a portion of all this industry could not have gone on without my presence. Nevertheless, I must not pride myself too much on my activity and utilitarianism.

Russians, Saxons affected to intend joining Friedrich Wilhelm in his Pommern Expedition; and of the latter there did, under a so-called Field-Marshal von Wackerbarth, of high plumes and titles, some four thousand--of whom only Colonel von Seckendorf, commanding one of the horse-regiments, is remarkable to us--come and serve. The rest, and all the Russians, he was as well pleased to have at a distance. Some sixteen thousand Danes joined him, too, with the King of Denmark at their head; very furious, all, against the Swedish-iron Hero; but they were remarked to do almost no real service, except at sea a little against the Swedish ships. George <b>I.</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> fleet in the Baltic; but only [...] "to protect English commerce." [...] On the whole, the Siege of Stralsund, to which the Campaign pretty soon reduced itself, was done mainly by Friedrich Wilhelm. He stayed two months in Stettin, getting all his preliminaries completed; his good Queen, Wife [...] "Feekin," [...] was with him for some time, I know not whether now or afterwards. In the end of June, he issued from Stettin; took the interjacent outpost places; and then opened ground before Stralsund, where, in a few days more, the Danes joined him. It was now the middle of July: a combined Army of well-nigh forty thousand against Charles; who, to man his works, musters about the fourth part of that number.
