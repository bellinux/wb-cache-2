40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2011. In {{the past}} it was {{believed}} that the payment of dividends would decrease the funds available to finance growth, and would therefore lead to lower <b>future</b> earnings <b>growth.</b> This belief was challenged in recent years with research that tested the relationship between dividend payout and <b>future</b> earnings <b>growth,</b> both on the individual company and aggregate market level in different countries. The results contradicted popular belief, and showed that companies with high payout ratios tend to realise stronger <b>future</b> earnings <b>growth.</b> This study tested the same relationship in South Africa and concluded that even in a developing country, dividend payout will still lead to higher <b>future</b> earnings <b>growth...</b>|$|R
40|$|We derive {{and test}} a consumption-based intertemporal asset pricing {{model in which}} an asset earns a risk premium if it {{performs}} poorly when expected <b>future</b> consumption <b>growth</b> deteriorates. The predictability of consumption growth combined with the recursive preference delivers news about <b>future</b> consumption <b>growth</b> an additional risk factor, in addition to news about current consumption growth.

The cross-sectional test shows that the model explains reasonably well the dispersion in average excess returns of 25 portfolios sorted on size and book-to-market, as well as 25 portfolios sorted on size and long-term return reversal.

5|$|During {{his service}} as {{lieutenant}} governor, Beshear formed and chaired the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a privately financed group assembled {{to make recommendations}} for the state's <b>future</b> <b>growth</b> and development. The 30-person commission was formed in July 1984 and presented its report – containing more than 100 recommendations – in September 1986. Among the recommendations in the commission's report were several changes to the state constitution, adopted in 1891. The recommended changes included eliminating the offices of state treasurer, {{secretary of state and}} superintendent of public instruction, holding elections only in odd-numbered years instead of every year, and raising the term limit for the state's constitutional officers from one term to two consecutive terms. The state legislature showed little interest in calling a constitutional convention, however, and the commission's recommendations were not immediately adopted, though several have since been implemented. Other recommendations in the commission's report included the creation of lifelong learning programs, implementation of criminal justice reforms, and improvements in worker training. The commission was hailed by some as the most substantial undertaking by a lieutenant governor to date, but was panned by others as a move by Beshear to better position himself for a run for governor in 1987.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} of Antoinists: desservants who perform worship, people who wear the religious clothing, regular faithful who attend the service every week, and occasional members or visitors. As its {{aim is to}} heal and comfort through faith, Antoinism does not seek to convert new people. The number of followers is difficult to assess as there are no statistics established by the religion. After a period of rapid growth in Belgium, the number of followers is currently on {{the decline in the}} country and some temples were forced to close due to lack of money or faithful; for example, in 2003, Human Rights Without Frontiers counted less than 150 worshipers in the country. In France, however, the religion remains active and counts about 2,500 regular members. Estimates of the worldwide membership vary from few thousand to 200,000. The <b>future</b> <b>growth</b> of the number of followers, however, can be affected by certain rules of the group. As it does not practice proselytism, Antoinism suffers from a lack of social visibility and many people are unaware even of Antoinist temples in their neighborhood. Moreover, because of the availability required for worship and the absence of income in the religion, dressed members and desservants are often old-age retired people.|$|E
5|$|These winds {{resulted}} in widespread agricultural, environmental and structural damage. Hundreds of structures sustained severe damage, mostly consisting of roofs blowing off. The most severe losses {{took place in}} Albany where most homes had partial or complete roof failure. Air-borne debris also damaged buildings during the storm. Nearly 80% of the apple crop {{was lost in the}} Donnybrook-Manjimup area. A total of 154,400m3 (5.4million ft3) of timber was lost as well as a potential 200,000m3 (7million ft3) of <b>future</b> <b>growth</b> on established trees. Widespread dust storms also ruined crops and removed topsoil from many areas. Near the coast, the combined effects of strong, onshore winds and little rain led to significant inland sea spray. Numerous power lines and stations failed during the storm due to winds as well as dust and salt accretion. Large portions of the South-West Land Division were without electricity due to Cyclone Alby; Perth nearly sustained a complete breakdown of power services. This led to secondary losses attributable to the storm such as production failure.|$|E

Deductible temporary differences measured by total deductible temporary differences divided by total assets.
