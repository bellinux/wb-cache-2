However, the core issue <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> was to minimize Vietnam's cooperation with the Soviets.

5|$|Security {{concerns}} dominated Soviet decisions {{concerning the}} Far East. Chief among these was gaining unrestricted {{access to the}} Pacific Ocean. The year-round ice-free areas of the Soviet Pacific coastline—Vladivostok in particular—could be blockaded by air and sea from Sakhalin island and the Kurile Islands. Acquiring these territories, thus guaranteeing free access to the Soya Strait, was their primary objective. Secondary objectives were leases <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> Eastern Railway, Southern Manchuria Railway, Dairen, and Port Arthur.|$|E

5|$|Although both Sjair Abdoel Moeloek and Siti Akbari {{were often}} {{performed}} on stage, {{the similarities between}} the two were not discovered for several years.

Kwee Tek Hoay followed this article with another discussion of the work's origins in 1925. Later writers criticised Lie's other works as blatant adaptations. Tan Soey Bing and Tan Oen Tjeng, for instance, wrote that none of his works were original. Tio Ie Soei, in response, stated that Lie had changed the stories he had adapted, and thus shown originality.|$|E

5|$|Although the UN {{casualties}} were moderate during the battle, the Third Battle of Seoul {{was a significant}} success <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> military in Korea, and the UN forces' morale had sunk to its lowest point during the war.

Ridgway then took immediate steps to restore the morale and fighting spirit of the UN forces in Korea. With Ridgway leading the Eighth Army, MacArthur started to regain confidence in UN forces' ability to hold Korea, and the UN evacuation plan was abandoned on January 17.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its impact}} and scale, the Battle of Triangle Hill {{is one of}} the least known episodes of the Korean War within the Western media. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese,</b> this costly victory {{presented}} an opportunity to promote the value of endurance and sacrifice. The courage demonstrated by the Chinese soldiers at Triangle Hill was repeatedly glorified in various forms of media, including several major motion pictures. Qin Jiwei was also celebrated as the hero of Shangganling and eventually rose to become the Minister of Defense and the Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress.

Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve; instead the Chinese government relocated inland to Chongqing and continued the war.|$|E

On July 28, 2010 while in Taipei to play in Yao Ming's charity game, Lin said he had not made a decision yet on whether he would represent Chinese Taipei (the name used by Taiwan in international sporting competitions). In June 2011, the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association (CTBA) included Lin in its preliminary squad of 24 players for the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship. The next month, however, the CTBA announced that Lin would not be included on their roster due to a knee injury.|$|E

5|$|In {{the realm}} of modern research, the late British {{biochemist}} and historian of Chinese science Joseph Needham (1900–1995) (known as Li Yuese in China) did extensive research and analysis of Su Song's texts and various achievements in his Science and Civilization in China book series. Joseph Needham also related many detailed passages from Su's contemporary medieval Chinese sources {{on the life of}} Su and his achievements known in his day. In 1956, John Christiansen reconstructed a model of Su Song's clocktower in a famous drawing, which garnered attention in the West towards 11th-century Chinese engineering. A miniature model of Su Song's clock was reconstructed by John Cambridge and is now on display at the National Science Museum at South Kensington, London. In China, the clocktower was reconstructed to one-fifth its actual scale by Wang Zhenduo, who worked <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> Historical Museum in Beijing in the 1950s.|$|E
