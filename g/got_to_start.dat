500|$|Critics of The Wild Bunch {{noted the}} theme {{of the end of the}} outlaw gunfighter era. Pike Bishop says, [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> {{thinking}} beyond our guns. Those days are closing fast." [...] The Bunch live by an anachronistic code of honor without a place in 20th-century society. When they inspect Gen. Mapache's new automobile, they perceive it marks the end of horse travel, a symbol also in Peckinpah's Ride the High Country (1962) and The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970).|$|E
500|$|Throughout the 1999 season, Tolliver {{remained}} a vocal supporter of coach Ditka despite the Saints' 3–13 record, saying [...] "I think he's {{a heck of}} a football coach, a great motivator. We just <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> buying what he's selling." [...] Ditka was fired by the Saints, but as training camp for the 2000 season began, Tolliver was the Saints' backup quarterback behind Jeff Blake. On August 1, the Saints traded for quarterback Aaron Brooks, which left Tolliver to compete for the third-string spot alongside Jake Delhomme. The Saints' roster was reduced to 53 players, and Tolliver was among those cut. When the Saints lost Jeff Blake for the season in mid-November due to a dislocated foot, Tolliver was re-signed by the Saints, though he did not play a game that season. In July 2001, Tolliver was signed by the Green Bay Packers. This briefly reunited him with Brett Favre, with whom he was teammates in Atlanta. However, he was cut in the preseason when Doug Pederson won the backup job, and this stint marked the end of Tolliver's professional career.|$|E

[...] He re-introduced the ban on July 2007, despite the additional burden of Gov. Strickland's veto threat.

2500|$|I've {{given up}} {{speaking}} to them. I've said basically everything that possibly {{can be said}} to this bunch. I'm basically leaving it up to them now. They are going to show me if they really want to play for Australia and whether they really want to play under me. I'll find out over the next three games and my decision will be made as to my future as a captain and a player after that... I don't think it's my captaincy... but if we continue to lose, you've just <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> saying: [...] "Right, someone else has to come in and see if they can do something different." [...] It just gets as simple as that. That's the way I see it. The fellows are not responding to me and that's that. I'll find out over the next three games if that's the case or not.|$|E
2500|$|Her self-hatred {{accelerated}} into raging {{cycles of}} bulimia and anorexia, repressing the issue until questioned. Jackson said, [...] "people say to me: `Okay, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> eating more. You're too thin.' But {{when you look}} in the mirror, you see something totally different." [...] She continued, [...] "I had swung so far in one direction, I never thought I could swing so far in the other. You're losing weight and getting smaller, and I'd still say to myself I could afford to lose a little more". However, she refused professional guidance, reluctant to examination. She briefly saw a psychologist before an encounter with a spiritual guru, who aided her emotional recovery. Jackson recounted, [...] "we went to this very spiritual place in the desert... That's where I met him, this cowboy. He's in his fifties, and he's full of wisdom. He's an older man who has experienced a great deal, and he {{used to be in the}} music industry, on a smaller scale. He even understood that side of my life". She also began using coffee enemas to remove [...] "sad cells", leading to media scrutiny. The trauma lead to a brief duration of sexual questioning, saying [...] "Am I curious? I think every girl has wondered". Jackson culminated the experiences into the album's subject matter, recording over two years.|$|E

Northern Illinois' prolific offense continued their scoring by executing a 10-play, 75-yard drive highlighted by a 44-yard run by Lynch on a 4th and 1. Lynch would run it into the end zone for a 1-yard touchdown three plays later. After the Golden Flashes went three-and-out, the Huskies scored, this time via a 29-yard field goal by Sims.|$|R
