5|$|By 1857, {{both the}} Royal Mint {{and the public}} were {{dissatisfied}} {{by the state of}} the copper coinage. Much of it was worn or defaced by advertisements, and 14 percent of the pennies in commerce were Boulton's 1797 cartwheels. The fact that pennies of different specifications circulated side by side precluded the weighing of quantities of copper coin to ascertain the value. Both sorts of pennies were deemed too heavy for daily use. The copper coins were so heavy that Charles Dickens in Nicholas Nickleby had Mr Mantalini contemplate suicide by drowning himself in the Thames, <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> filled with halfpennies.|$|E
5|$|The first Guardian video shows {{one officer}} lunge at Tomlinson from behind, strike {{him across the}} legs with a baton and push his back, causing him to fall. On 8 April Channel4 News {{released}} their own footage, which showed the officer's arm swing back to head height before bringing it down to hit Tomlinson on the legs with the baton. Another video obtained by The Guardian on 21 April shows Tomlinson standing by a bicycle rack, hands in <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> when the police approach him. After he is hit, he can be seen scraping along the ground {{on the right side}} of his forehead; eyewitnesses spoke of hearing a noise as his head hit the ground.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{was ready}} {{to carry out the}} {{assassination}} on July21. He wore a new suit and a black derby hat, and in <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> he had a gun and a dagger fashioned from a steel file. He went to Frick's office and asked to see him, saying he was the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick was too busy to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from What Is to Be Done? On July23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned to see him, Berkman burst into the office and took aim at Frick's head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.|$|E

5|$|Diệm's {{advertising}} {{included the}} parading of giant pageant-style floats of Bảo Đại {{through the streets}} of Saigon, depicted with bags of money on his shoulders, a deck of cards in his hands, and with naked blonde women and bottles of cognac in his arms. This was a reference to the head of state's reputation for opulence, gambling and womanising. In particular, the blonde hair referred to Bảo Đại's purported penchant for European mistresses with whom he liaised on the French Riviera. Bảo Đại's dummy was accompanied by that of a Frenchman putting gold into <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> thereby questioning his nationalist credentials. Posters and effigies associating Bảo Đại with a pig's head were disseminated, while a prominent newspaper composed and encouraged the people to sing insulting songs about Bảo Đại.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin got the {{inspiration}} {{to write his}} next play, a courtroom drama called A Few Good Men, from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah (who had graduated from Boston University Law School and {{signed up for a}} three-year stint with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps). Deborah told Sorkin {{that she was going to}} Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre. He and his roommates had purchased a Macintosh 512K so when he returned home he would empty <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> of the cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for A Few Good Men.|$|E
5|$|The Guardian {{obtained}} a four-minute video on 21 April from an anonymous bystander {{who had been}} filming on Cornhill between 7:10 and 7:30pm. The footage shows Tomlinson standing behind a bicycle rack in Royal Exchange Passage {{with his hands in}} <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> and a group of advancing police officers. When a police dog approaches him, he turns his back. At that point, he is hit on the legs and pushed by the TSG constable, and can be seen scraping along the ground {{on the right side of}} his forehead. Eyewitnesses said they heard a noise as his head hit the ground. The IPCC sought an injunction against the broadcast of the video by Channel4 News, but a judge rejected the application. An image obtained by Sky News on 24 April appears to show bruising on the right side of Tomlinson's forehead. A head injury was recorded by the second and third pathologists.|$|E
50|$|Amour de poche (Girl in <b>His</b> <b>Pocket)</b> is a French comedy fantasy {{film from}} 1957, {{directed}} by Pierre Kast, written by France Roche, starring Jean Marais. The scenario {{was based on}} a novel Diminishing Draft of Waldemar Kamempfert. The film was known under the title Girl in <b>His</b> <b>Pocket</b> (US), Alchimie der Liebe (West Germany), Nude in <b>His</b> <b>Pocket.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{took from}} <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> the {{revolver}} which Lassen had dropped. It {{was a perfect}} little weapon, and fully charged. He replaced it in <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> keeping <b>his</b> finger upon the trigger.|$|R
60|$|He took an {{envelope}} from <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> thrust the notes inside, gummed down the flap, and, drawing a fountain pen from <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> wrote an address. The dying man watched him and nodded feebly.|$|R
5|$|Miller {{returned}} to the bowling crease in England's second innings. He immediately broke through Washbrook's defences, only to see the ball graze the stumps without dislodging the bails. After two Miller outswingers had evaded the outside edge of Washbrook, the batsman appeared unsettled. One bouncer was hit over square leg in an uncontrolled manner for a four, and another flew in the air, narrowly evading Loxton at fine leg. However, Miller did not take a wicket and ended with 0/15 from 14 overs, but again caught Compton. Not {{for the first time}} during the season, the Australian paceman riled the crowd when he launched a series of short-pitched balls at Edrich, apparently in retaliation for the Englishman's bouncing of Lindwall. The paceman struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened and ordered him to stop his short-pitched barrage. In another incident, Miller was playing poker with the Englishmen during a rain delay. When the weather cleared, Hassett beckoned him to return to the field for the resumption. Miller ignored him and the poker match continued against the English players who were not currently batting. He won the pot and pocketed the money, before hurriedly running onto the ground late. When he was on the field and approaching the centre, Miller pulled the money out of <b>his</b> <b>pockets.</b> He brandished the notes to the crowd and taunted his English colleagues. The match ended in a draw after the entire fourth day and half of the fifth day was washed out. England declared upon the resumption of play on the final day and set Australia a target of 317 for victory. The tourists reached 1/92 to ensure a draw.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigator}} later {{testified that}} 146 spent shell casings were recovered inside the building. Another 68 casings were collected outside, {{for a total}} of 214 rounds fired by the attacker and responding police officers. A medic who treated Hasan said <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> were full of pistol magazines. When the shooting ended, he was still carrying 177 rounds of unfired ammunition in <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> contained in both 20- and 30-round magazines. The incident, which lasted about 10 minutes, resulted in 13 killed12 soldiers and one civilian; 11 died at the scene, and two died later in a hospital; and 30 people wounded.|$|E
25|$|After the {{incident}} a Tirana airport video was released to Reuters showing Ekinci being checked by security. He was body searched and {{passed through a}} metal detector, then removed his belt, sweater, and emptied <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> but was cleared to proceed to his flight.|$|E
60|$|He {{took out}} a letter-case from <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b> Out of this he drew a packet of bank-notes, which he laid {{on the table in}} front of Heron, then he placed the receipt {{carefully}} into the letter-case, and this back into <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to using his home-made guitar {{he prefers to}} use coins (especially a sixpence from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic plectrum, {{on the basis that}} their rigidity gives him more control in playing. He is known to carry coins in <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> specifically for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|Later on, Wolfe sends {{some of his}} operatives, {{including}} Johnny Keems, {{to investigate}} some of the friends and associates of Michael Molloy. The next day, the body of Johnny Keems is found killed by a hit-and-run driver. Since <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> lack $100 in money Archie gave him to bribe potential witnesses, Wolfe and Archie consider it to be linked the Molloy murder, but the authorities make no such connection since the apparent murderer of Molloy has already been convicted.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eight}} Harry Potter films {{screened}} from 2001 to 2011, Harry Potter has been portrayed by British actor Daniel Radcliffe. Radcliffe {{was asked to}} audition {{for the role of}} Harry in 2000 by producer David Heyman, while in attendance at a play titled Stones in <b>His</b> <b>Pockets</b> in London. The role has been highly lucrative for Radcliffe; as of 2015, he had an estimated wealth of $110 million and was paid a collective $53 million for the last two films.|$|E

25|$|During the First and Second World Wars {{there were}} large {{military}} {{camps in the}} town. In the First World War the camps were built to house 22nd Division, Kitchener's Third New Army. The south camp nearly encircled Seaford ladies college. In December 1914 there was a strike by a mainly Welsh regiment over the remoteness of the accommodation and mud. In 1919 two thousand Canadians rioted after {{one of them was}} beaten by a camp picket for walking with his hands in <b>his</b> <b>pockets.</b>|$|E
25|$|Between {{midnight and}} 8:00a.m. on June 3, 1961, a {{burglary}} {{occurred at the}} Bay Harbor Pool Room in Panama City, Florida. An unknown person broke a door, smashed a cigarette machine and a record player, and stole money from a cash register. Later that day, a witness {{reported that he had}} seen Clarence Earl Gideon in the poolroom at around 5:30 that morning, leaving with a wine bottle and money in <b>his</b> <b>pockets.</b> Based on this accusation alone, the police arrested Gideon and charged him with breaking and entering with intent to commit petty larceny.|$|E
25|$|He {{developed}} a reputation as being very friendly with children. He carried candy in <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> for the street urchins in Mantua and Venice, and taught catechism to them. During papal audiences, he would gather children around him {{and talk to them}} about things that interested them. His weekly catechism lessons in the courtyard of San Damaso in the Vatican always included a special place for children, and his decision to require the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine in every parish was partly motivated by a desire to reclaim children from religious ignorance.|$|E
60|$|But it was {{impossible}} {{on account of the}} gloom for Fitzpiers to read it then, while he had the curiosity to do so, and he put it in <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b> <b>His</b> imagination having already centred itself on Hintock House, in <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> the letter remained unopened and forgotten, all the while that Marty was hopefully picturing its excellent weaning effect upon him.|$|R

60|$|He {{passed her}} a {{document}} {{which he had}} drawn from <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b> She took it from him wonderingly. When she had read a few lines, the colour came streaming into her cheeks. She threw it to the ground. He {{picked it up and}} replaced it in <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1894, he bowled 422 overs {{for his new}} county, conceding just 516 {{runs and}} {{capturing}} 41 wickets. The following year, at Trent Bridge (when {{it was so cold}} that KS Ranjitsinhji kept his hands in <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> and fielded the ball with his feet), Shaw bowled 100.1 five-ball overs as his former team accrued a gargantuan 726. He finally retired again two matches later, when Sussex drew against Middlesex, and only ever returned to the first-class scene in 1897 to play the Gentlemen of Philadelphia. He subsequently became a publican and died aged 64.|$|E
25|$|The bridge became internationally notorious in June 1982, {{when the}} body of Roberto Calvi, a former {{chairman}} of Italy's largest private bank, was found hanging from one of its arches with five bricks and around $14,000 in three different currencies in <b>his</b> <b>pockets.</b> Calvi's death was initially treated as suicide, but he was on the run from Italy accused of embezzlement and in 2002 forensic experts concluded that he had been murdered by the Mafia, to whom he was indebted. In 2005, five suspected members of the Mafia were tried in a Rome court for Calvi's murder, but all were acquitted in June 2007 for lack of evidence.|$|E
25|$|One {{night while}} working the late shift, he killed a man. Authorities briefly arrested him, but Quantrill {{claimed that he}} had acted in self-defense. Since there were no eyewitnesses and the victim was a {{stranger}} who knew no one in town, William was set free. Nevertheless, the police strongly urged him to leave Mendota. Quantrill continued {{his career as a}} teacher, moving to Fort Wayne, Indiana in February 1856. The district was impressed with Quantrill's teaching abilities, but unfortunately the wages remained meager. Quantrill journeyed back home to Canal Dover that fall, with no more money in <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> than when he had left.|$|E
