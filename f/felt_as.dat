5|$|Tremors {{from the}} {{earthquake}} were <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> {{far north as}} Saginaw, Michigan, and as far west as communities on Lake Michigan. There were no reports of damage. USGS also listed reports of tremors from as far west as Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} the Dutch East Indies in 1942, Soeman {{was made a}} school supervisor by occupying forces. He soon became involved in politics, being elected to the Shūsangikai, a Japanese-sponsored regional representatives' council, for Riau. He later recalled that, {{because he had been}} elected rather than selected by the Japanese forces—and thus had strong backing among the community, which could be used for revolution—he had <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though he was under constant surveillance. This situation continued until after the Japanese withdrew from Indonesia and Sukarno proclaimed an independent Indonesia.|$|E

50|$|The show {{involves}} a City Slickers/The Simple Life-like premise, with the privileged children of celebrities {{working on a}} Colorado cattle ranch. The television series was created by Justin Berfield and produced by his J2TV producing partner, Jason <b>Felts,</b> <b>as</b> well as Joe Simpson. The show premiered August 7, 2005.|$|R

5|$|Compared to his two fellow protagonists, C.T. Smith was {{considered}} more novel. Anime News Network {{said he was}} one of the few fresh points of the series and had the most distinctive design among the cast, though even his role as an unassuming businessman who is actually an expert gunman <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if it must be borrowed from somewhere else. MangaCast's reviewer, on the other hand, found his role mostly extraneous, due to being overshadowed by Gamma. Animemaniacs Magazine Online noted that Smith's physical appearance was later echoed by Bleachs central antagonist, Sōsuke Aizen.|$|E
5|$|Hualālai last {{erupted in}} 1801. A severe {{earthquake}} swarm shook the volcano in 1929, lasting about a month. This caused $100,000 worth {{of damage to}} the Kona district ($1.2 million as of 2010), and two earthquakes with magnitudes of 5.5 and 6.5 were <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> far away as Honolulu. This was probably caused by magma movement near the surface, {{but there was no}} surface activity or eruption.|$|E
5|$|I reckon {{it really}} sums up just what I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> {{far as the}} {{competition}} goes. It's a very overwhelming process to go through and you really do feel that there's something else that got you there.

5000|$|The 1931 team, ranked #2 by the Dickinson Rating System, {{featured}} <b>Felts</b> <b>as</b> a fullback in {{the backfield}} with Don Zimmerman. He weighed 180 pounds. <b>Felts</b> was selected <b>as</b> a third-team All-American in 1931 on the [...] "Captain's Poll" [...] of the Central Press Association. Felts scored three {{touchdowns in the}} 27 to 0 victory over Auburn. He scored in the 20 to 7 victory over Georgia, the school's first ever loss at Sanford Stadium. Felts scored in every {{game of the season}} through the Sewanee game, leading the SoCon with 81 points at that moment.|$|R

5|$|M.I.A.'s {{commentary}} on the oppression of Sri Lankan Tamils, Palestinians and African Americans has drawn praise and criticism. The United States has restricted her access {{into and out of}} the country during her career since the release of her debut album. M.I.A. notes that the voicelessness she <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> a child dictated her role as a refugee advocate and voice lender to civilians in war during her career.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{aftershocks}} {{occurred after}} the main tremor. The first four (of magnitude 2.8, 2.2, 4.2 and 3.4) occurred within 12hours {{of the main}} shock. A 2.5-magnitude shock occurred just after midnight on August 25, followed at 05:07 UTC by the strongest, a magnitude 4.5 aftershock that woke many residents in Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C., and was <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> far away as New England, Georgia, and Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Press Gang {{has proved}} to be a series that can {{transport}} you back to how you <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> a teenager, sharper that the world but with as much angst as acute wit... Never again can a show get away with talking down to children or writing sloppily for them. Press Gang, possibly the best show in the world.|$|E

5|$|The Virginia Seismic Zone {{has not had}} {{a history}} of regular {{earthquake}} activity. Earthquakes are rarely above 4.5in magnitude, because Virginia is located away from the edges of the North American Plate. The largest earthquake, at an estimated 5.9magnitude, was in 1897 near Blacksburg. A 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck central Virginia on August 23, 2011, near Mineral. The earthquake was reportedly <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> far away as Toronto, Atlanta and Florida.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. A critic from Billboard liked Streisand's tone and vocals, but others <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if {{the album was}} ultimately forgettable. Barbra Streisand...and Other Musical Instruments is Streisand's lowest selling studio album of her entire career; {{it is also one}} of four studio albums released by the singer not to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. However, it peaked in the lower positions of both Canada and the United States. The album was eventually released as a CD in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Val Guest, who had {{directed}} The Quatermass Xperiment, returned for Quatermass 2. Guest once again sought {{to create a}} film that <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> real as possible, using many cinema vérité techniques such as hand-held cameras. He was assisted in this respect by the moody, overcast cinematography of director of photography Gerald Gibbs, who also made extensive use of day for night photography for the film's climactic scenes. Guest planned each day’s shooting carefully, creating meticulous storyboards detailing all the shots {{he wanted to make}} that day.|$|E

50|$|The glengarry was knit and <b>felted</b> <b>as</b> one cover. Dicing {{and body}} as one piece. It was dark blue with dicing that was red, blue, and white, in two rows high that was off set by one square to the right. The glengarry was lined in black {{polished}} cotton {{and while some}} of the originals that still exist today have quilting and other lining decorations, all five have different lining treatments.|$|R

5|$|Across {{the mountainous}} {{northern}} Barlavento Islands, Fred produced gusty winds and downpours; São Nicolau experienced sustained hurricane-force winds of 80mph (130km/h)—the highest recorded wind speed from the hurricane. Rainfall on that island was moderate, peaking at 3.5in (90mm) at Juncalinho. Many old trees were uprooted, a few landslides took place, and several villages lost power on that island. The strong winds downed power poles and wrecked {{the roof of}} a church in the village of Cabeçalinho. In Ribeira Brava, São Nicolau's most populous town, the storm damaged 70homes, destroyed greenhouses, and leveled a farm, leaving several families homeless and others without a source of income. In Carriçal, similar effects were <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> torrential rainfall flooded homes, washed out roads, and ruined fruit and hydroponic crops. Much of São Nicolau's livestock, including cattle from Hortelã, was lost in the storm. Damage to property and agriculturein particular banana and sugarcaneon the island reached CVE$50million ($500,000).|$|E
5|$|Finucane had {{completed}} 108 fighter operations over France {{by the fourth}} week of June 1942. On 27 June, Leigh-Mallory, {{with the approval of}} Sholto Douglas, promoted Finucane to wing commander. Finucane became the youngest wing commander in the RAF, and was to lead the Hornchurch Wing. Duncan Smith later said, that though he admired Finucane, he resented the young fighter pilot's appointment and <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> an older, experienced leader, he could have led the wing himself. Duncan Smith also felt the press gave the young pilot too much attention. Nevertheless, the two maintained a cordial relationship. In his short time as wing commander of Hornchurch, Finucane made a few alterations to the formation. The most notable was to tighten flying discipline, loosen formation flying and increase low-level navigation skills.|$|E
5|$|Focused only several {{kilometres}} {{below the}} surface, the earthquake resulted in significant shaking {{over a large}} portion of central-eastern South Island. Maximum ground motions registered at VIII (severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale in Christchurch, while strong shaking (MM VI) was felt in adjacent populated areas such as Rolleston and Lincoln. The landforms of Sumner recorded intensified shaking due to the effects of its topographic setting. Widespread lighter motions were observed throughout much of the remaining region, with slight property damage reported from as far afield as Dunedin. The earthquake was <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> far away as New Plymouth and Invercargill.|$|E

5|$|Great Barrington had a {{majority}} European American community, who treated Du Bois generally well. He attended the local integrated public school {{and played with}} white schoolmates. As an adult, he wrote about racism which he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> a fatherless child {{and the experience of}} being a minority in the town. But teachers recognized his ability and encouraged his intellectual pursuits, and his rewarding experience with academic studies led him to believe that he could use his knowledge to empower African Americans. Du Bois graduated from the town's Searles High School. When Du Bois decided to attend college, the congregation of his childhood church, the First Congregational Church of Great Barrington, raised the money for his tuition.Horne, p. 7.Lewis, pp. 39–40.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009, he {{was named}} in the {{preliminary}} 25 man squad to represent Queensland in the opening State of Origin match for 2009 and was subsequently picked on the interchange bench for the opening State of Origin match on 3 June. Hunt came on in the 25th minute of the game to replace the injured Justin Hodges and played in his centre position {{for the remainder of}} the match which Queensland won. The consequences of this game would be <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> part of the 2009 swine flu pandemic in Australia. Hunt's Queensland teammate Ben Hannant tested positive to the Swine influenza and the Brisbane Broncos subsequently put all of their Origin players in quarantine.|$|E
5|$|The Nightfly debuted on Billboard Rock Albums chart {{at number}} 39 {{during the week}} ending October 23, 1982, peaking at number 25 on November 13. It debuted on the magazine's all-genre Top LPs and Tape chart on October 30 at number 45; it climbed to number 11, its peak, on November 27. It also charted on Billboard Black LPs chart, peaking at number 24. Internationally, the album charted higher: in Norway, it reached number seven on the charts. In Sweden and New Zealand, the album peaked at numbers eight and nine, respectively. The Nightfly {{performed}} poorer than Gaucho commercially; Fagen <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though the label did not market the album properly or effectively. WBCN in Boston, inspired by the album cover, developed a promotion in which listeners could register to host their own radio show.|$|E
