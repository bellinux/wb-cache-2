Jacob Bøggild and Pernille Heegaard point out that: One of the crucial aspects which any interpretation must confront is the final sequence of the tale, in which the little mermaid, against all odds, is redeemed from immediate damnation and accepted into the spiritual sphere, where the [...] "daughters of the air" [...] reside. In this, she is apparently promised the [...] "immortal soul", which it has been her main motivation to obtain [...] - [...] along with the prince, of course.

50|$|In 1968 the P11 was {{revised to}} the P11A and marketed as the Norton Ranger, a road legal {{version of the}} P11 with a more {{comfortable}} seat to make it suitable for normal road use as well as off road racing. The P11A/Ranger also had a low level exhaust fitted with long tapered silencers with detachable <b>end</b> caps and <b>baffles.</b> The availability of spare parts at the Norton-Villiers factory led to several changes of specification, and the P11, P11A and Ranger were produced with four different types of oil tanks (two alloy, two steel), 3.6 gallon and 2.2 gallon petrol tanks, different types of handlebars, forks and frames, two ignition systems and two different cylinder heads (with the last models produced using Norton Commando castings. The last model made was the Norton Ranger 750 which {{was the same as}} the P.11A/Ranger with stronger side stand mounting brackets, a front brake light and a Ranger 750 transfer on the oil tank and battery cover.|$|R
50|$|While most {{tanks are}} manufactured, some fuel tanks are still {{fabricated}} by metal craftsmen or hand-made {{in the case}} of bladder-style tanks. These include custom and restoration tanks for automotive,aircraft, motorcycles, and even tractors. Construction of fuel tanks follows a series of specific steps. The craftsman generally creates a mockup to determine the accurate size and shape of the tank, usually out of foam board. Next, design issues that affect the structure of the tank areaddressed - such as where the outlet, drain, fluid level indicator, seams, and baffles go. Then the craftsmen must determine the thickness, temper and alloy of the sheet he will use to make the tank. After the sheet is cut to the shapes needed, various pieces are bent to create the basic shell and/or <b>ends</b> and <b>baffles</b> for the tank. Many fuel tanks' baffles (particularly in aircraft and racecars) contain lightening holes. These flanged holes serve two purposes, they reduce the weight of the tank while adding strength to the <b>baffles.</b> Toward the <b>end</b> of construction, openings are added for the filler neck, fuel pickup, drain, and fuel-level sending unit. Sometimes these holes are created on the flat shell, other times they are added {{at the end of the}} fabrication process. <b>Baffles</b> and <b>ends</b> can be riveted into place. The heads of the rivets are frequently brazed or soldered to prevent tank leaks. Ends can then be hemmed in and soldered, or flanged and brazed (and/or sealed with an epoxy-type sealant) or the ends can be flanged and then welded. Once the soldering, brazing or welding is complete, the fuel tank is leak-tested.|$|R
40|$|Today’s {{networks}} {{are suffering from}} unnecessary latency and poor system performance. The culprit is bufferbloat, which is the existence of excessively large and frequently full buffers inside the network. Large buffers have been inserted all over the Internet without sufficient thought or testing. They damage or defeat the fundamental congestion-avoidance algorithms of the Internet’s most common transport protocol. Long delays from bufferbloat are frequently attributed incorrectly to network congestion, and this misinterpretation of the problem leads to the wrong solutions being proposed. Congestion is an old problem on the Internet, appearing in various forms with different symptoms and causing major problems. Buffers {{are essential to the}} proper functioning of packet networks, but overly large, unmanaged, and uncoordinated buffers create excessive delays that frustrate and <b>baffle</b> <b>end</b> users. Many of the issues that create delay are not new, but their collective impact has not been widely understood. Thus, buffering problems have been accumulating for more than a decade. We strive to present these problems with their impacts so that the community can understand and act upon the problem and, we hope, learn to prevent future problems. This article does not claim {{to be the first to}} identify the problems of excessive buffering, but it i...|$|R
40|$|Wall mounted {{loudspeakers}} {{are becoming}} more and more appealing to the average home. The disadvantage with these kinds of loudspeakers is that the acoustic flaws of a room, in most cases, get more excited. A company named DLS Svenska AB is keen to find a solution to this problem and the following mission statement, translated from Swedish to English, was handed to the author from their loudspeaker engineer named Mats Andersen:“Mission to investigate, measure and verify the possibility to remove/minimize the effect the closest room boundary has on the sound from wall mounted speakers, or speakers standing close to a wall, using acoustic and electrical solutions. With focus on acoustic solutions. Electric solutions essentially means analog solutions, but also to examine digital solutions (DSP). ”Five different prototypes called Chamfer, Plate, Pressient, Toploaded and Type R were developed based on acoustical theories. Chamfer was focusing on edge diffractions. Plate had a wide baffle which would lower the box shadowing. Pressient and Type R were based on microphone technologies and Toploaded used an acoustical mirror. Frequency spectrums for all the prototypes were measured in a room called multi-studio and in an anechoic chamber. By doing this it was possible to identify the problems created by the wall behind the loudspeaker. The polar patterns were measured in the anechoic chamber to investigate if the prototypes had the wanted radiation patterns. The results produced by the experiments in this thesis say that it is possible to minimize the effect the closest room boundary (i. e. the wall behind the loudspeaker) has on the sound from wall mounted speakers. However, it is not possible to remove the effect completely, with the tested acoustical solutions. Electrical solutions were not investigated since it fell outside the author’s educational orientation. Some of the prototypes did not behave as expected. All of the prototypes require further work to be usable for conventional loudspeakers, even those which had good cardioid or half spherical characteristics. Chamfer did minimize the back radiation quite well, but some pretty drastic interference appears when the <b>baffle</b> <b>ends</b> right at a room boundary. Plate did extend the box shadowing to lower frequencies so the reflections would not disturb the midrange as much. The baffle did, on the other hand, create drastic edge diffractions. Pressient did not work at all. It had a system which works in theory but needs more implementation in real life to work properly. Toploaded had more success than the previous prototypes. The acoustical mirror worked very well and the prototype acted as ka goes to zero up to 900 Hz instead of creating minimum and maximum. The theory for Type R works, but it created some acoustical disturbances which make it unsuitable for conventional use. Validerat; 20150224 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
