50|$|Kochetkova was {{a member}} of the Russian team for the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and was {{considered}} a viable medal contender on several events, including for the prestigious All Around event. Prior to the competition, the Russian team were considered the dark horse contender for a Team medal behind the defending two-time World Champion Romanians, fast rising Chinese, and home country Americans. After a strong showing in the compulsory exercise, the Russians had a narrow lead at the halfway stage and were clearly delighted as they left the arena. Only the Americans stayed within striking distance going into the crucial Optionals. However while the team stars were generally solid, errors from several of the lower rank Russian gymnasts, combined with nerves from the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>event</b> and the noise from the mostly-American crowd, dropped them to 2nd place in the finals. Kochetkova, as one of the most experienced team members, showed strong performances and seemed one of the least affected by the high octane atmosphere, but it was not enough to rescue her team from silver.|$|E

Published ages for this <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>event</b> reveal large discrepancies between the crystallisation ages of certain eclogite-facies minerals and apparent cooling ages of micas. We present precise U-Pb zircon (78. 95 ± 0. 13 Ma) and rutile (79. 6 ± 1. 1 Ma) ages for the eclogites, {{as well as}} new U-Pb zircon ages for trondhjemites from the Semail ophiolite (95. 3 ± 0. 2 Ma) and amphibolites from the metamorphic sole (94. 48 ± 0. 23 Ma). The new eclogite ages reinforce published U-Pb zircon and Rb-Sr mineral-whole rock isochron ages, yet are inconsistent with published interpretations of older 40 Ar/ 39 Ar phengite and Sm-Nd garnet dates. We show that the available U-Pb and Rb-Sr ages, which are in tight agreement, fit better with the available geological evidence, and suggest that peak metamorphism of the continental margin occurred during the later stages of ophiolite emplacement. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe age of Ultra-high {{pressure}} metamorphism {{and early}} cooling remains controversial in the Alps. In {{a new approach}} to the problem, samples from the undeformed Hercynian metagranite, Brossasco, were studied using an ultra-violet laser ablation microprobe technique for 40 Ar- 39 Ar dating. The results demonstrate the frequent occurence of excess argon with high 40 Ar/ 36 Ar ratios (1000 - 10000) and a strong relationship between apparent ages and metamorphic textures. The highest excess argon ratios are always associated with high closure temperature minerals or large diffusion domains within single mineral phases. The best interpretation of this relationship seems to be that excess argon was incorporated in all phases during the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>event,</b> then mixed with an atmospheric component during rapid cooling and retrogression, producing a wide range of argon concentrations and 40 Ar/ 36 Ar ratios. In the present case, some ages in the range 60 - 110 Ma could be explained by the presence of excess argon incorporated around 40 - 50 Ma ago. Similar results found in other high-pressure terrains in the Alps may reconcile the argon geochronometer with other systems such as Rb/Sr, U/Pb or Sm/Nd. This study therefore calls for an increasing use of high resolution in-situ sampling techniques to clarify the meaning of 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages in many high pressure terrains...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn the Variscan belt of Western Europe, the {{lifetime}} {{and evolution of}} the oceanic domain is poorly constrained by sparse, outdated and unreliable multigrain ID-TIMS U-Pb zircon dating. In this article, we present a complete in situ LA-ICP-MS dataset of about 300 U-Pb zircon analyses obtained {{on most of the}} ophiolitic and eclogitic outcrops of Southern Brittany, comprising new dating of previously published zircon populations and newly discovered rock samples. In situ dating and cathodo-luminescence imaging of each zircon grain yields new absolute time-constraints on the evolution of the Galicia-Moldanubian Ocean. The new results confirm that the opening of this oceanic domain is well defined at about 490 Ma. In contrast, the generally-quoted 400 - 410 Ma-age for the high-pressure event related to the subduction of the oceanic crust is definitely not recorded in the zircons of the eclogites. In light of these new data, we propose that the obduction of oceanic rocks occurred at about 370 - 380 Ma while the high-pressure event is recorded at 355 Ma in only a few zircon grains of some eclogite samples. Additionally, this large scale dating project demonstrates that the zircons from eclogites do not systematically recrystallise during the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>event</b> and consequently their U-Pb systems do not record that metamorphism systematically. These zircons rather preserve the isotopic memory of the magmatic crystallization of their igneous protolith.

40|$|Ph. D. Preserved Archean crust dominantly {{recording}} lower {{temperature conditions}} (greenschist to amphibolites facies), the earliest widespread record of ultrahigh- temperature metamorphism {{occur in the}} Neoarchean. Considering that, collisional tectonic setting has been postulated as a possible tectonic scenario for the generation of ultrahigh-temperature metamorphism, sites where Archean cratons underwent collision can be potential sites for preservation of ultrahigh-temperature metamorphic granulites. The Limpopo Complex is a high-grade metamorphic terrain considered to have formed by collision in Neoarchean time between the Archean Kaapvaal and Zimbabwe cratons. Detailed petrographic and mineral chemical characterization of representative high Mg-Al granulites from the Southern Marginal Zone, Central Zone and the Northern Marginal Zone – forming the three subzones of the Limpopo Complex – was carried out. Evidence {{for the preservation of}} mineral assemblages considered diagnostic of ultrahigh- temperature metamorphic conditions, such as orthopyroxene+sillimanite±quartz, high-Al/(MgTs) orthopyroxene, sapphirine+quartz, spinel+quartz, corundum+quartz and antiperthite, are shown from these high Mg-Al granulites. Most of these mineral assemblages are reported for the first time from the Limpopo Complex. In addition, two unique textures are also reported – one, the discovery of corundum lamellar intergrowth with orthopyroxene from a high Mg-Al granulite from the Southern Marginal Zone, and second, the rare occurrence of sapphirine+quartz post dating orthopyroxene+sillimanite±quartz from two Mg-Al granulites from the Central Zone. Pressure-temperature calculations including representative P-T phase diagrams computed for the bulk compositions of the granulites studied clearly indicate ultrahigh- temperature conditions for all the three subzones. In contrast to two previous studies, one each for the Southern Marginal Zone (~ 950 °C) and the Central Zone (~ 930 °C), this study presents higher temperature estimates of ~ 1050 to ~ 1100 °C for the three subzones. Together with examples of ultrahigh-temperature metamorphic conditions reported by the two previous studies, this study shows that the ultrahigh-temperature event reported here has affected the length and breadth of the three subzones of the Limpopo Complex. Further, the high-pressure conditions inferred from the early composition of orthopyroxene from the unique orthopyroxene-corundum intergrowth and the P-T phase diagrams computed for representative granulites from the three zones suggest a common <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>event</b> in all the three sub zones of the Limpopo Complex...|$|E
40|$|This {{work is a}} petrological {{research}} on the partial melting of metapelitic rocks, and includes a petrographic-microstructural study, a bulk- and microchemical characterization, and the thermodynamic modelling of phase equilibria. The Nordmannwick nappe is a high grade tectonic unit occurring structurally below the Lyngen Ophiolite (Northern Scandinavian Caledonides, Northern Norway). This unit is compositionally heterogeneous (metapelitic schists, metapsammites, carbonatic layers, mafic bodies) but it is clearly characterized by the occurrence of high grade metamorphic imprint {{with the formation of}} migmatites. Two samples of migmatites (LY 4 f and LY 131) belonging to this high grade portion were studied. The metapelitic sample LY 4 f shows relicts of kyanite porphyroblasts and a peak mineral assemblage constituted by biotite + garnet + plagioclase + quartz + sillimanite + former melt. The mineral assemblage formed after the retrogression is biotite + white mica + garnet + plagioclase + quartz + sillimanite. The metapsammitic sample LY 131 is characterized by the presence of partially replaced kyanite crystals and by a peak mineral assemblage constituted by biotite + garnet + K-feldspar + plagioclase + quartz + sillimanite + former melt, whereas the mineral assemblage formed after the retrogression is biotite + white mica + garnet + plagioclase + quartz + sillimanite. A sequence of three main metamorphic events is detected by means of microstructural observations and electron microprobe analyses for both samples. The first one is a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>event,</b> followed by a high temperature melt-bearing event. The last metamorphic event occurs during retrogression. Phase equilibria modelling, performed with Perple_X in the MnO – Na 2 O – CaO – K 2 O – FeO – MgO – Al 2 O 3 – SiO 2 – H 2 O – TiO 2 (MnNCaKFMASHT) system, was applied to sample LY 4 f and LY 131. The temperature and the pressure estimated for sample LY 4 f at the peak conditions are 800 ± 30 ° and 0. 85 ± 0. 07 GPa, whereas after the retrogression are 650 ± 30 ° and 0. 77 ± 1. 8 GPa. The temperature estimated for sample LY 131 at the peak conditions is 790 ± 10 °, whereas the pressure could not be constrained. The temperature and the pressure estimated after the retrogression are 670 ± 10 ° and 0. 75 ± 0. 07 GPa. This work allows a satisfactory modelling of the anatectic history of these rocks in the low-, medium-P conditions, and also of their retrograde cooling history.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} of thermally annealing and sequentially partially dissolving single zircon grains prior to high-precision Isotope Dilution Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ID-TIMS) is presented. This technique {{is applied to}} complex zircon from the Precambrian Lewisian Gneiss Complex of Scotland. Up to six partial dissolutions were conducted at incrementally higher temperatures and analysed at each successive step. ID-TIMS analyses reveal the portions of zircon affected by the lowest temperature partial dissolution step have suffered Pb-loss. Successively higher temperature partial dissolution steps yield a series of analyses from the younger domains, followed by mixing trajectories with older components, presumably from the inner domains. Specifically, for a partially retrogressed granulite tonalite gneiss from the central block (Assynt), high-grade metamorphic zircon ages of c. 2500 Ma and c. 2700 Ma are resolved with a protolith age of c. 2860 Ma also recognised. This unequivocally demonstrates two separate episodes of high-grade metamorphism affected rocks from this region. The c. 2700 Ma age provides a minimum age constraint on the <b>highest</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>event</b> known from Archean crustal rocks.

40|$|Deformation in the Grenville {{province}} culminated at 1. 15 - 1. 0 Ga. {{and possibly}} extended back to 1. 3 Ga., {{making it the}} youngest structural unit within the Canadian shield. Recent work in the Central Gneiss Belt (CGB) of SW Grenville province has outlined a number of domains of different structural, litholgical and metamorphic character. These discrete crustal blocks are bounded by broad, ductile shear zones which commonly include tectonic fragments of gabbroic and anorthositic material {{in various stages of}} strain and degradation of the primary fabric. The shear zones are the lower crustal reflection of ductile thrusting during the culmination of the Grenvillian orogeny and contain kinematic indicators that consistently imply northwest-directed transport. The metagabbros have a continental basaltic signature and were probably emplaced in an extensional setting at around 1. 2 Ga. They then underwent a complex and multi-stage textural evolution controlled by reaction kinetics. Early reactions were diffusion-controlled and involved the subsolidus formation of garnet-bearing coronas that separated plagioclase from olivine and opaque oxides. This probably occurred during cooling from magmatic temperatures at depths of around 35 km in the crust where calcic plagioclase was unstable and became more sodic, thus liberating Ca for corona growth and exsolving excess Al as spinel. Olivine coronas have been modelled in terms of steady state diffusion in order to estimate relative component mobilities during corona growth. The following results were obtained: restricted mobility of aluminium {{and to a lesser extent}} Si, was rate-controlling during corona growth; uphill Ca-diffusion may have been important; Mg and Fe have similar mobility with Mg at least as mobile as Ca and probably more so. Metastable under the changing regional metamorphic conditions, the delicate coronas were susceptible to further P-T-aH 20 constrained reactions which eventually led to the formation of two pyroxene granulites or garnet amphibolites. The host rocks equilibrated under granulite and upper amphibolite facies conditions at 1. 16 to 1. 03 Ga. and the P. T estimates range from 8 - 10 Kbars and 700 - 750 0 C, with no significant differences between the various lithotectonic domains. This implies that provided the shear zones were sites for large crustal displacements, the cation distributions employed in the geothermobarometers must have been reset by continuous reactions after thrusting, and further that the fluid activity controlled whether granulite or upper amphibolite facies assemblages became stable on both local and regional scales. Relict high pressure assemblages are present in garnet peridotites and sapphirine-bearing mafic boudins collected from the ductile shear zones and as in the coronite metagabbros, unfavourable kinetics were again responsible for the preservation of the discontinuous reaction textures. In the sapphirine-bearing meta-eclogite the primary mineralogy involving high-Al Clinopyroxene, pyrope-rich garnet and kyanite±plagioclase, records pressures of around 14 - 16 Kbars whereas subsequent decompression products including sapphirine, corundum, spinel, plagioclase, quartz and orthopyroxene, equilibrated at around 11 - 12 Kbars. As it is unlikely that the host rocks went through such a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>event,</b> it is proposed that the shear zones were active and incorporated material fron depths of at least 50 - 55 Km in the thickened Grenvillian crust during the culmination of the Grenvillian orogeny...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the wintertime {{physical}} properties of atmospheric aerosol particles on the basis of data observed at the K-puszta regional background station in Hungary. In Hungary wintertime smog episodes are linked to strong stable air (<b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> blocking <b>events)</b> with thermal inversion. These atmospheric conditions are frequently formed during winter months (November–February) due to the special geographical location of the country. The formation of smog events is highly probable in cases of thermal inversion periods sustaining for at least 4 days. We discuss in the paper the role of high-pressure blocking events in aerosol properties in terms of PM 10 concentrations, aerosol size distributions, new particle formation and optical properties. We found that high-pressure blocking events have significant impacts on the size distribution and particle formation processes. At K-puszta the aerosol is in highly aged state with size distribution dominated by the accumulation mode. This is further supported by the optical properties, e. g., by high scattering Ångstrom exponent and by relatively weak absorption. The most significant effect of extreme episodes is manifested in the changes in PM 10 concentrations and, consequently, in aerosol optical properties. The PM 10 concentrations, scattering coefficients and absorption coefficients considerably increase to extreme values that are characteristic of a heavily polluted atmosphere rather than rural air. Our results indicate that in winter, the air quality at Kpuszta is often influenced by regional air pollution as shown by spatial distribution of PM 10 concentration. It is found that PM 10 had almost the same concentration in regional background air and in different types of urban environments. The special meteorological conditions and the role of regional-scale transport can explain why local abatements in cities cannot lead to significant improvement of the air quality during smog events...|$|R

40|$|The Sabie River Basalt Formation is a {{group of}} tholeiitic basaltic rocks erupted ca 190 Ma ago in the eastern zone of the Karoo Igneous Province of {{southern}} Africa. It is traceable over a distance of 700 km from Zululand, northwards along the Lebombo monocline into the Transvaal and south-east Zimbabwe. An abrupt compositional change in this formation occurs about halfway down its length {{in the vicinity of the}} Sabie and Komati Rivers: basalts to the north are known to be enriched in certain incompatible elements relative to basalts in the south, which are comparable in geochemistry to most basaltic rocks in the southern part of the Karoo Igneous Province. New data obtained in this work include 134 major and trace element whole-rock analyses, some 400 analyses of constituent minerals, 38 ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ratio determinations, 19 ¹⁴³Nd/¹⁴⁴Nd ratio determinations, 16 common Pb determinations and 12 oxygen isotope analyses. The "normal" (N) and "enriched" basaltic rocks are distinguished by differences in the concentrations of Ti, P, Zr, Nb, Y, La, Ce and Nd (high field strength elements). Broadly these differences are substantiated by K, Rb, Ba and Sr, but with much more overlap. The "enriched" group of basaltic rocks has been further subdivided into a low-Fe "enriched" (LFE) group and a high-Fe "enriched" group (HFE). The LFE-group basalts, which predominate at the base of the stratigraphic sections, are considered to be equivalent to basalts occurring in the N. Lebombo. In the central Lebombo N-group basalts predominate in the mid- and upper portions of the sections and HFE-group basalt occurs near the top of each section. Interbedding of all basalt groups occurs in the Sabie River section at the northern end of the study area, while the N- and HFE-group basalts are interbedded in the Crocodile and Komati River sections further to the south. The decrease in LFE-group basalt abundance southwards is accompanied by an increase in N-group basalt abundance. HFE-group basalts appear to be unique to the central Lebombo area of the Karoo Igneous Province and are volumetrically less significant than N- or LFE-group basalts. Petrogenetic models involving closed-system fractional crystallization; coupled assimilation (of granitic crust) fractional crystallization; replenished, tapped and fractionated magma chambers and partial melting are examined. Granitic crustal contamination appears to have been significant only in some samples of the N group where assimilation of granitic material has proceeded in a bulk fashion described by an AFC model. RTF models are dynamically more realistic than closed-system fractional crystallization models and explain increases in incompatible elements with decreasing MgO in the LFE and HFE groups. Variations in the N group, however, require varying degrees of partial melting of a N-type source to be explained fully. RTF models may explain the absence of any stratigraphic correlations of element abundances in the three groups. The HFE group may be related to an uncontaminated N-type parent composition by a combination of continued fractional crystallization from an N-group parent composition and varying degrees of partial melting of an N-type source. The only petrogenetic process by which the N and LFE groups may be related is different degrees of partial melting. However, this demands a source composition which has no resemblance on trace element and isotopic grounds, to observed mantle xenolith compositions. The preferred model is one in which the LFE group is derived from old sub-cratonic mantle similar to garnet-bearing "cold" peridotite xenoliths and the N group from a source similar in composition to estimates of primitive mantle. The existence of two types of mantle derived continental flood basalt magmas occurs in other Mesozoic basalt provinces in "southern" Gondwanaland (e. g. Kirwanveggan of Antarctica, Etendeka of Namibia and the Parana Basin of South America). It is suggested that there is a geographical association of LFE-type basalts with Archaean crust (or Archaean crust re-worked in low temperature - <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>events)</b> and N-type basalts with post-Archaean crust (or Archaean crust re-worked in high temperature - low <b>pressure</b> <b>events).</b> This model suggests the derivation of the LFE group, from old sub-cratonic lithospheric mantle relatively enriched in incompatible elements and the N group being derived from more recently accreted and less enriched lithospheric mantle underlying younger crustal terraines...|$|R
