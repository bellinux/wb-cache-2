5|$|A merging draft, BioCode, was {{published}} in 1997 {{in an attempt to}} standardize nomenclature in these three areas, but <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> formally adopted.

A revised BioCode that, instead of replacing the existing codes, would provide a unified context for them, was proposed in 2011. However, the International Botanical Congress of 2011 declined to consider the BioCode proposal. The ICVCN remains outside the BioCode, which does not include viral classification.|$|E
