5|$|Commercial solar {{water heaters}} began {{appearing}} in the United States in the 1890s. These systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable <b>heating</b> <b>fuels.</b> As with photovoltaics, solar water heating attracted renewed attention {{as a result of}} the oil crises in the 1970s but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices. Development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s and annual growth rates have averaged 20% since 1999. Although generally underestimated, solar water heating and cooling is by far the most widely deployed solar technology with an estimated capacity of 154GW as of 2007.|$|E
25|$|The {{displaced}} dispatchable generation {{could be}} coal, natural gas, biofuels, nuclear, geothermal or conventional hydro. Rather than starting and stopping nuclear or geothermal it is effective {{to use them}} as constant base load power, when that power is not needed it can displace <b>heating</b> <b>fuels</b> or be converted to storage for later use. Biofuels and hydro can be saved for later when intermittents are not generating power. Alternatives to burning coal and natural gas with the production of greenhouse gases may eventually make them a stranded asset that is left in the ground. Highly integrated grids favor flexibility and performance over cost, resulting in more plant capacity and lower capacity factors.|$|E

25|$|Similar {{dangerous}} {{soil conditions}} and insufficiently resistant buildings {{are also on}} the southern, western and northern boundaries of San Francisco and San Pablo bays and would also be severely affected by a major earthquake on the Hayward fault. As that portion includes the so-called Silicon Valley, the potential economic disruption due to destruction of works in progress and the dismantling of microelectronics fabrication plants could have an economic effect extending worldwide. The current estimates of the probability of a major earthquake on any of the numerous regional faults range up to 70 percent within the thirty-year period 2000–2029. A recent quiet period following many years of minor activity is considered to be particularly ominous by many, although geologists have not yet been able to predict earthquakes with any useful accuracy. They do warn that all residents of the region should be prepared for a large event and its subsequent effects (e. g., lack of water, firefighting, first aid, electricity, motor and <b>heating</b> <b>fuels,</b> etc.) and that much life-safety protective work remains to be done.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the past}} {{electrical}} generation was all dispatchable and consumer demand led {{how much and}} when to dispatch power. The trend in adding intermittent sources such as wind, water, solar, means the grid is beginning to be led by the intermittent supply instead. Effective use of intermittent sources relies on electric power grids that are carfully managed, for instance using highly dispatchable generation that is able to shut itself down whenever an intermittent source starts to generate power, and to successfully startup without warning when the intermittents stop generating. [...] Ideally {{the capacity of the}} intermittents would grow to be larger than consumer demand for periods of time, creating excess low price electricity to displace <b>heating</b> <b>fuels</b> or be converted to mechanical or chemical storage for later use.|$|E
