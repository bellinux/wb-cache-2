5|$|Larsson was {{commissioned}} to decorate all {{the walls of}} the central staircase in the museum except for one, and he wanted to decorate the last wall as well. He intended the last wall to present a contrast to the other illustrations of the staircase. Whereas the painting Gustav Vasa enters Stockholm 1523 presented a midsummer theme with a triumphant king, Larsson wanted the last illustration to be a midwinter theme with a king who sacrificed himself <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E

He signed treaties in 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847, and 1854.

5|$|The {{doctrine}} {{emphasizes the}} importance of personal empowerment, proposing that it is God's will <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>people</b> to be happy. The atonement (reconciliation with God) is interpreted to include the alleviation of sickness and poverty, which are viewed as curses to be broken by faith. This is believed to be achieved through donations of money, visualization, and positive confession.|$|E
5|$|For most of George's regency and reign, Lord Liverpool {{controlled}} {{the government as}} Prime Minister, with little help from George. His ministers found his behaviour selfish, unreliable and irresponsible. At all times he was much {{under the influence of}} favourites. Taxpayers were angry at his wasteful spending at a time when Britons were fighting in the Napoleonic Wars. He did not provide national leadership in time of crisis, nor act as a role model <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>people.</b> Liverpool's government presided over Britain's ultimate victory, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed. After Liverpool's retirement, George was forced to accept Catholic emancipation despite opposing it. His only legitimate child, Princess Charlotte, died before him in 1817 and so he was succeeded by his younger brother, William.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} {{military}} mandarin from central Vietnam, Định moved south {{when his father was}} posted to Gia Định as the provincial commander. Định grew up to lead {{a military}} colony, overseeing the settlement and economic development of his constituency. He gained a reputation for being an able leader and land developer who cared <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>people.</b> When France began its invasion of southern Vietnam in 1859, Định organised local militia to reinforce the imperial army. As the regular army units suffered defeats on the battlefield, its remnants joined Định's partisans, and by 1861, he had around 6,000 men under his command. Định built his own resistance base and organised guerrilla attacks against the French. His success led Tự Đức to grant Định command of the southern partisans and to order the regular commanders to coordinate their plans with him. Định's forces quickly gained the respect of the French. They focused on disrupting the French bureaucracy and military posts in addition to the transportation of rice. Their most notable attack was the sinking of L'Espérance in December 1861.|$|E

25|$|In the New Testament, Jesus {{speaks of}} the {{importance}} of Christians forgiving or showing mercy towards others.

25|$|Jandamarra The Play (2008) {{was sold}} out before its opening season premiere at the Perth International Arts Festival. As the {{director}} of Bunuba Films since 2000, Oscar {{was one of the}} driving forces in the company's marathon journey to bring Jandamarra's story to the stage. Jandamarra, a Bunuba warrior born in 1873, was famous <b>for</b> leading <b>his</b> <b>people</b> in an armed uprising against the British colonisation of their lands. He outsmarted the police and settlers in the Kimberley for years, before being killed in 1897 at the age of 24. Geoffrey Bolton, a distinguished Australian historian, compared Jandamarra to guerilla leaders like the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata and Sicilian rebel Salvatore Giuliano. Oscar said Jandamarra was fighting <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>people’s</b> freedom. “He was not an outlaw, he was fighting <b>for</b> <b>his</b> land, I think he was a freedom fighter”.|$|R
25|$|Nonetheless, despite this, an {{aged and}} weary Potsʉnakwahipʉ ("Buffalo Hump") led and settled his {{remaining}} followers on the Kiowa-Comanche reservation near Fort Cobb in Indian Territory in Oklahoma.

25|$|On December 5, 1946, the war council told Qazi Muhammad {{that they}} would fight and resist the Iranian army if they tried to enter the region. The lack of Kurdish tribal support however made Qazi Muhammad only see a {{massacre}} upon the Kurdish civilians performed by the Iranian army rather than Kurdish rebellion. This forced him to avoid war at all cost, {{even if it meant}} sacrificing himself <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>people,</b> which eventually happened and led to his execution.|$|E

An interesting feature of the book is that the accounts of chapters 2-6 and the visions in chapter 7 are in Aramaic (after the first few lines of chapter 2 in Hebrew). However, the visions of chapters 8-12 are in Hebrew, as is the introduction, chapter 1.|$|E

Bhishma adds that Duryodhana is loved by the people, while Yudhishthira is an unknown quantity to them.
