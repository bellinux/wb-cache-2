40|$|The coal {{handling}} process involves {{a number of}} activities from loading and unloading to stockpile. This procedure {{can be carried out}} by coal conveying system which includes a large number of mechanical equipment. The important activities under {{coal handling}} include loading/unloading, dumping, transporting etc. which are done with the help of various mechanical equipment. Every organization wants to profit as much as possible and increases their production rate by using maximum effort for care and maintain. And it is possible if the equipment is running in good condition with zero breakdowns, zero accident, and zero wastage. This research work presents a practical analysis for monitoring the operational performance of equipment, which shows the two additional objectives: the first one is the identification of major causes of production losses which are born from malfunctions, breakdowns, and bad operating programme. And the second one is the implementation of a suitable and appropriate methodology for improvement of coal handling systems, which handling the coal from bunker to stockyard within an industry. The data are analyzed and compared with World class to Obtained OEE. During the operation, many reasons are there, which affect the production rate called six big losses. To minimize the six big losses and improve productivity, an accurate effective estimation of equipment is necessary and offers a suitable methodology. For the purpose of the study, a case study methodology is applied in order to analyze in the depth of maintenance in a real context. The primary focus of this research work is to monitor the equipment performance in coal handling plants and its contribution to the company for overall operation. The OEE data are recorded through tables and compared to world class OEE considering the operational losses and also performance reports are briefly analyzed through figures in terms of equipment failures in different locations, idle time for materials, operators and speed loss time for minor stoppages like sensor blocked, cleaning/checking or component jamming. For minimizing the downtime and promote productivity, a suitable methodology is developed through tables for determining the status of coal handling equipment viz. Tippler, Side arm charger, Reversible apron <b>feeder,</b> <b>Belt</b> conveyor system, Stacker, Reclaimer. This research work deals with the quantitative measurement of equipment performance in coal handling plant, which defines losses for many reasons. As a result, valuable information is provided concerning the performance monitoring of production equipment and implementing a suitable methodology for improvement of coal handling machinery operations viz tippler, side arm charger, reversible apron <b>feeder,</b> <b>belt</b> conveyor, stacker, reclaimer. Introduce the estimation and evaluation of OEE procedure which is highly valid and accurate performance indicator and has become very popular in all the industries starting from mining area for excavation of material to harbour area for material handling. OEE shows a right metrics to analyze the ordinary issue and improving the whole process. There are many formulas, systems and metrics being used to improve the whole production process, but one and only OEE reduces complex problem into easy. The biggest advantage of OEE allows companies to have separate business functions by applying a single easy to understand the formula. OEE {{is by far the most}} effective benchmarking tool in making sound management and maintenance decisions.

40|$|A recent {{increase}} in the number of <b>belt</b> <b>feeder</b> downtime events at the Client’s sites and a changing economic environment has prompted the need for a better understanding of <b>belt</b> <b>feeder</b> resistance loads occurring at site. A better understanding of the loads actually occurring at site will be used to make recommendations on how the current design process could be improved. The Bruff and TUNRA methods currently used for <b>belt</b> <b>feeder</b> design were reviewed and used to predict the pressure of the <b>belt</b> <b>feeder</b> hydraulic drive system for a range of initial fill bin levels. Trials were then carried out at one of the Client’s iron ore sites to verify these design predictions over a range of bin levels. The results of the trial indicate that the current design methods significantly over-predict belt feed resistance. These prediction methods also fail to predict the relationship between initial start-up pull out force and initial fill bin level. The results suggest that an arched stress field is partially formed in the hopper during the filling process resulting in significantly lower initial pull-out forces. This implies that a smaller drive system could have been used for this particular application, potentially resulting in significantly reduced installation costs. The results do not, however, provide enough evidence to be able to confidently state that the pull-out force on a <b>belt</b> <b>feeder</b> in a different application would also be significantly less than the TUNRA prediction.

This has a distinct advantage over nonflexible feeding schemes such as bowl feeders which require considerable adjustment to changeover from one part to another.

40|$|Material {{handling}} {{is undoubtedly}} {{the most important}} and in fact an indispensable job in industries for it is encountered at every stage right from the time raw materials enter the factory gate to the point when it leaves in form of finished products. The engineering of material handling falls under two categories depending on form of material: bulk solid handling and unit handling. In case of handling lumpy materials like coals etc., feeder plays a vital role as an uninterrupted source of uniform feed provider to the conveyor system. Although several <b>feeders</b> like <b>belt,</b> apron, screw, <b>feeders</b> etc are available, reciprocating feeders are still in use because it ensures a continuous and controlled feed rate, is low in cost, its drive mechanism is simple, it can handle wide range of miscellaneous materials including lumps, easy in assembly and disassembly and maintenance requirement is quite low. The challenge which we have taken via the project, is to design a drive mechanism for a reciprocating coal feeder. We call it a challenge because we have to design various intricate components like couplings, worm reducers, gearbox etc. We call it complicated since all the components are interdependent on each other to a great extent. So we cannot design anything randomly. We have to take into considerations the smallest of small things like the various forces acting, how each component can fail under various stress conditions. We have to optimize everything right from the motor selection, to speed reduction ratio selection, to the capacity of coal which we can handle. We are going to follow the above-mentioned strategies so that our project does not remain just a theory but can become a reality for industries...|$|R

40|$|In {{automation}} {{and handling}} engineering, supplying work pieces between different stages along {{the production process}} chain is of special interest. Often the parts are stored unordered in bins or lattice boxes and hence have to be separated and ordered for feeding purposes. An alternative to complex and spacious mechanical systems such as bowl <b>feeders</b> or conveyor <b>belts,</b> which are typically adapted to the parts' geometry, is using a robot to grip the work pieces out of a bin or from a belt.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Since {{the era of}} industrialization, the {{handling}} of materials in bulk form has become a necessary process {{for a range of}} industries throughout the world. Bulk handling and storage facilities should be designed and operated to obtain both maximum reliability and efficiency as well as encourage economy. A better understanding of the stress field and arching behavior and an accurate assessment of the bin wall pressure are essential steps to achieving reliable design of the storage bins or the feeder system. To date, the determination of the critical mass-flow hopper opening dimensions to prevent blockages due to the formation of stable, cohesive arches has been based on the radial stress field generated in the lower region of the hopper. The surcharge loads on the hopper have not been taken into account. Non-linear effects caused by the hopper surcharge loads in mass-flow analysis need to be addressed. In this study, a large number of experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of the surcharge pressure and the filling level on the hopper wall pressure during arching. The failure mechanism of the arches is discussed by means of studying the arch profile in the mass-flow hopper. In this study, to ensure efficient feeding, the hopper and feeder geometry are designed as an integral unit. The stress field at the hopper/feeder interface is of particular interest due to the role that it plays in estimating the feeder loads. In reality, the two-dimensional stress field assumed in the mass-flow hopper is influenced by the shear force due to the feeder operation. The combination of the active stress field and the passive stress field in the mass-flow hopper is suggested. This study also attempts to provide an accurate estimation of the feeder loads by investigating the feeder loads given by a combination of two methods. Apart from the comparisons between the experimental and theoretical results, numerical simulations using the discrete element method were carried out additionally to assist in the investigation of the hopper wall pressures and feeder loads. The influences of the various parameters on the hopper wall pressure, such as filling heights and outlet dimensions, are presented in this thesis.

This dyke is approximately 1500 m wide at the sampling area and extends for more than 150 km NNE/SSW. Major and trace element geochemistry of the dyke indicates that the magmas that formed this intrusive body were sub-alkaline, tholeiitic and boninitic, {{and the presence of}} a negative Nb anomaly indicates the involvement of subducted oceanic lithosphere during magma genesis, most likely an inherited signature from earlier subduction events and the Mesoarchaean collision of the Tasiast-Tijirit and Choum-Rag el Abiod Terranes. A palaeomagnetic study was also undertaken on samples collected from two different sections across the dyke. However, no within- or inter-site grouping of any palaeomagnetic directions could be identified, thus precluding any palaeographic interpretation. The Ahmeyim Great Dyke is interpreted {{to be part of the}} feeder system for a 2733 Ma Large Igneous Province (LIP); tholeiitic-komatiitic greenstone belts of this age are absent in the West African Craton (WAC) but are present on many other blocks. However, additional constraints are required to reliably link the Ahmeyim Great Dyke with any other such LIP-type greenstone belts in late Archaean supercontinent reconstructions.

A computerised tank-based waste pellet monitoring system was developed and used to study feeding rhythms in greenback flounder. It consisted of an infrared sensor and a recording unit capable of continuously detecting wastage with reference to time. Actual feed intake was determined as the difference between pellets presented by a mechanical <b>belt</b> <b>feeder</b> and the uneaten pellets detected by the monitoring system. Diel feeding rhythms were described by the temporal variation of actual feed intake at intervals of 30 mm. The role of light-dark (LD) cycles and food deprivation in the regulation of diel feeding rhythms in greenback flounder (75 - 281 g) was examined. The fish is a diurnal feeder, but is capable of feeding at night. Feeding appeared to have an endogenous circadian component. A LD 12 : 12 cycle was a potent environmental cue to entrain circadian feeding rhythms. Re-feeding after a single period of food deprivation of 26 - 57 h was capable of temporarily over-riding feeding rhythms. The effect of feeding regime (difference in temporal distribution of feed) on growth and proximate body composition was investigated. The feeding regimes {{had an impact on the}} growth, with 1 meal of 3 h during the scotophase resulting in lower growth than the other five feeding regimes (feed continuously available, 12 meals of 1 h per meal, 6 meals of 1 h per meal, 3 meals of 2 h per meal, and 1 meal of 3 h during the photophase). However, the feeding regimes did not significantly influence proximate body composition. Locomotor activity patterns were examined in relation to feeding regimes and combinations of meal size and meal duration at a single daily meal. Groups assigned to a higher frequency (and hence a longer total duration) of daily meals were less active during mealtime even though the daily ration was equivalent as percentage of body weight per day. A distinct food anticipatory activity (FAA) was observed in the groups of fish receiving a single daily meal either during photophase or during scotophase, and FAA also developed before at least one out of three daily meals but not before any meal in the regimes of six daily meals or more than six daily meals. It was further demonstrated that whether or not a single daily meal is a potent zeitgeber to synchronise daily locomotor activity pattern depends on the combination of meal size and meal duration. The fish fed at the meal sizes of 0. 25 and 0. 5...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{mixing and}} {{blending}} of bulk materials can be undertaken using several techniques. Fluidised mixers, mechanical mixers, and multi-tube type blenders, with internal mechanical recirculation or external recirculation, are commonly employed for this purpose. However, {{the use of}} well designed mass-flow silos can often achieve good mixing and blending performance, usually by a recycling process, provided that the silo geometry is matched to the bulk material properties. Of direct benefit {{in the use of}} mass-flow silos in the mixing and blending of bulk materials is the reduction, over that of a mechanical mixer, of particle attrition and degradation during the process, a minimisation in the contamination of the bulk material by the mixer's lining, and a lower input energy requirement to the system. The mass-flow silo also allows the mixing and blending of both cohesive and free-flowing bulk materials whereas the multi-tube type blenders are limited in their application to free-flowing materials. If particle attrition and material contamination is not a problem in the mixing and blending of the materials then mechanical mixers may be employed. However, well designed blending silos and feeders can still be employed in the process to ensure the segregation of the materials will be avoided in the subsequent downstream handling of the mechanical mixer. Previous studies have examined the mixing and blending phenomena in a mass-flow silo, or 'in-bin blending' of bulk materials as it is commonly referred. However, these studies have all been based upon assumptions, or experimental data obtained from pilot scale test rigs, rather than being based upon analytical predictions derived from bulk material flow properties and silo geometry. The purpose of this thesis, therefore, has been to propose a theoretical prediction of the flow patters which occur in a mass-flow silo, with no flow restricting device at the outlet, and expand this concept to enable the determination of the blending efficiency of a given silo by utilising linear systems theory. With a knowledge of the blending efficiency of a mass-flow silo known, the theory was then extended, by the application of feedback response transfer functions (in systems terminology), to allow the determination of the mixing and blending of bulk materials in mass-flow silos with hopper-in-hopper type inserts/with a <b>belt</b> <b>feeder</b> interface. With the importance of supporting inserts in silos, the current study has examined normal flow stresses existing in mass-slow silos, with and without hopper-in-hopper type inserts. With a knowledge of these stresses, and by nothing the differing flow patters in silos sue to eccentric type material discharge, basic design constraints of rectangular supports have been shown with reference to their structural integrity in supporting various insert types in material flow channels...|$|R
