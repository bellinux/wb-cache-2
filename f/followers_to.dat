5|$|Although Muhammad had {{delivered}} Quranic verses commanding the Hajj, the Muslims had not performed it due to Quraysh enmity. In {{the month of}} Shawwal 628, Muhammad ordered his <b>followers</b> <b>to</b> obtain sacrificial animals and {{to prepare for a}} pilgrimage (umrah) to Mecca, saying that God had promised him the fulfillment of this goal in a vision when he was shaving his head after completion of the Hajj. Upon hearing of the approaching 1,400 Muslims, the Quraysh dispatched 200 cavalry to halt them. Muhammad evaded them by taking a more difficult route, enabling his <b>followers</b> <b>to</b> reach al-Hudaybiyya just outside Mecca. According to Watt, although Muhammad's decision to make the pilgrimage was based on his dream, he was also demonstrating to the pagan Meccans that Islam did not threaten the prestige of the sanctuaries, that Islam was an Arabian religion.|$|E

When later interviewed, Collazo said that as a young man, in 1932 he heard Albizu Campos speak about the Rhoads letter and decided to devote his life to the Nationalist movement.|$|E

We show that, under some conditions, an ex-post efficient revenue-maximizing auction—which solicits bids sequentially—partially discloses the leader's bid <b>to</b> the <b>follower,</b> <b>to</b> influence his learning. The disclosure rule that emerges is novel; it may reveal <b>to</b> the <b>follower</b> only a pair of bids to which the leader's actual bid belongs.

Those who migrated from Mecca along with Muhammad became known as muhajirun (emigrants).|$|E

Mirza Yahya had married the widow of the Báb against the Báb's clear instructions; dispatched <b>followers</b> <b>to</b> the province of Nur for the second attempt on the life of the Shah; and instigated violence against prominent Bábís who had challenged his leadership.|$|E

He took Ruth Anne Preece as his second wife and she had three children, named Glory, Power and Hallelujah. By 1902 his fame had spread as far as India, from where Mirza Ghulam Ahmad warned him of his false teachings and made a death prophecy against him stating that he would die within Mirza's lifetime, if he will claim that he was a god another time, which did come true as in the life time of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad he stopped claiming being a god. After the death of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad he claimed again being god and was sentenced to death and died.|$|E

This fortress fell at the end of March 1907 and Tiku began to work his way back to Tondon through the forest. He and the other leaders, Buginese and Torajan alike, were chased by Dutch troops. The other leaders capitulated to the Dutch and were sentenced to either three years in a prison in Makassar or exile to Buton. Tiku, meanwhile, stayed hidden in the forests.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite {{began to}} {{emphasize}} a strict hierarchy, teaching that his students needed his guidance, as {{he needed the}} guidance of the Next Level. Zeller notes that this naturally ensured {{that there would be no}} possibility of the group's continuing if Applewhite were to die. A relationship with Applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation; he encouraged his <b>followers</b> <b>to</b> see him as Christ. Zeller states that the group's previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite's role as a mediator. Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but, in the 1980s, the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority.|$|E

He spent most of the year in Wales, preaching the crusade, accompanied by the chronicler Gerald of Wales.

His lectures became a medley of religion and politics, punctuated by controversial attacks on the Catholic Church, and thus brought him under censure by the French government. The messianic element conflicted with Roman Catholic teachings, and some of his works were placed on the Church's list of prohibited books, though both Mickiewicz and Towiański regularly attended Catholic mass and encouraged their <b>followers</b> <b>to</b> do so.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{adaptive}} formation {{control is}} addressed for {{a network of}} autonomous mobile robots {{in which there are}} only two leaders knowing the prescribed reference velocity while the others just play the role of followers. Assuming that each follower has only two neighbors to form a cascade interconnection, an adaptive formation control law is designed that allows each <b>follower</b> <b>to</b> achieve a specific triangular formation with its two neighbors without the need to know the velocity of its neighbors. With this scalable design approach, any expected geometric pattern of a group of n robots with two leaders can be realized by assigning an appropriate neighbor relationship and specifying a desired formation for each <b>follower</b> <b>to</b> reach. Both rigorous analysis and simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive formation controller. ...|$|R
