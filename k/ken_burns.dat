2500|$|A {{prototype}} series titled Rurouni: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story {{appeared as}} a pair of separate short stories published in 1992 and 1993. The first story, published in December 1992 in the Weekly Shōnen Jump Winter Special issue of 1993, featured an earlier version of Kenshin stopping a crime lord from taking over the Kamiya family dojo. Watsuki described the first Rurouni story, echoing the [...] "Megumi Arc", as a [...] "pilot" [...] for Rurouni Kenshin. According to Watsuki, the final Rurouni Kenshin series was not composed entirely from his free will. Describing the creation of historical stories as [...] "hard," [...] Watsuki initially wanted to make his next series in a contemporary setting. An editor approached Watsuki and asked him to make a new historical story. With the historic concept, Watsuki intended to use the Bakumatsu time period from Moeyo <b>Ken</b> (<b>Burn,</b> O Sword) with a story akin to Sugata Sanshirō. Watsuki experimented with various titles, including Nishin (Two-Hearts) Kenshin, Yorozuya (Jack-of-All-Trades) Kenshin, and variations of [...] "Rurouni" [...] and [...] "Kenshin" [...] with different kanji in that order.|$|R
5000|$|Nobuhiro Watsuki based Shinomori on Hijikata Toshizō, {{the deputy}} Leader of the Shinsengumi. There are most {{certainly}} versions of Hijikata portrayed {{in books and}} fiction; Aoshi {{grew out of the}} Hijikata who killed his gentler feelings and buried his human weakness. Watsuki describes himself as a fan of the other version of Hijikata. Watsuki describes that version of Hijikata, seen in Moeyo <b>Ken</b> (<b>Burn,</b> O Sword), as [...] "a bundle of raw combat-instinct who keeps fighting until the very death." [...] Since, according to Watsuki, the addition of the Oniwabanshū occurred during the [...] "last minute," [...] he found difficulty writing with him since he had not resolved a [...] "concrete image" [...] for Aoshi. Watsuki says that he used no specific design model for Aoshi. As the image of Hijikata grew stronger within Watsuki, the Rurouni Kenshin author added fringes (bangs) to Aoshi's design. Watsuki held a chance to change the hairstyle while compiling the edited manga, but chose not to edit the hairstyle, since he did not want readers to believe that [...] "Aoshi was wearing a rug or anything." ...|$|R
40|$|Sport {{historians have}} largely avoided {{television}} history even though several series, like <b>Ken</b> <b>Burn</b> 2 ̆ 7 s Baseball and the BBC 2 ̆ 7 s More Than a Game, have reached large audiences. Only one journal, The Journal of Sport History, regularly reviews mediated forms of sport history, {{while the other}} journals only sporadically engage with television history and film. This article evaluates the documentary The Original Mermaid: The Amazing Story of Annette Kellerman by creating three fictitious reviews using Alun Munslow 2 ̆ 7 s tripartite model of historical inquiry: reconstructionism, constructionism and deconstructionism. These reviews of The Original Mermaid are intended to encourage sport historians {{to move beyond the}} view that television sport history is not worthy of serious consideration and to stimulate a critical appreciation of sport history on television. As part of this process of critiquing television history, there is an implicit critique - to employ a sporting metaphor - of {{the rules of the game}} of sport history. In some ways this article is a personal journey, but more significantly it addresses key 2 ̆ 7 moments 2 ̆ 7 in sport history as different methodological, epistemological and ontological positions have been adopted by practitioners...|$|R
