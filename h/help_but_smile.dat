500|$|Upon its release, {{the video}} {{received}} general acclaim from critics. Iona Kirby of Daily Mail praised the documentary-style video, which gives fans {{an opportunity to}} see the life of Rihanna and insight into what she likes to do. A reviewer from Rap-Up praised the video, commenting that it is a [...] "real blast in a glass!" [...] According to PopDash's Giovanna Falcone, the video shows [...] "Rihanna goofing around with friends and family, on stage and loving life, you can't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>smile</b> throughout." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator commented that the music video looks [...] "like one big, drunken night out." [...] A reviewer from Rolling Stone magazine also commented that the video [...] "finds Rihanna in an appropriately celebratory mood..... it's mostly a lot of shots of her partying backstage with friends and celebrities." [...] Sarah Maloy of Billboard magazine commented [...] "there are no special effects, storylines – and no chance of lawsuits," [...] referring to one of Rihanna's previous music videos, [...] "S", which was faced with two lawsuits. Maloy also noted that the video presents Rihanna's ordinary life just as it is.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of the series, Martin called them as the [...] "most {{entertaining}} characters" [...] of the series and [...] "one of anime's liveliest and most entertaining couples". He described their constant glee as infectious and their [...] "bizarre logic" [...] as priceless. He felt that their presence [...] "elevates the series from merely {{a very good one}} to a truly exceptional one." [...] He believes that they always [...] "make the most of their screen time", noting how every one of their actions [...] "give an entirely new twist to the events otherwise playing out normally." [...] Carl Kimlinger, also from ANN, adds that [...] "the things those two can do to a well-laid plan are simply appalling." [...] Davey Jones of Active Anime felt the pair was the [...] "highlight of the story" [...] and should have their own series. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment described the two as [...] "very off center in a colorful and fun way" [...] and believed they stood out from the large cast because they were [...] "far more outgoing." [...] He felt that the connections they make {{with the rest of the}} cast [...] "are fun to watch and there's only a kind of elegance to it". Beveridge commented that [...] "when this pair comes on the screen, [...] can’t help but smile" [...] and that he [...] "enjoy all of the scenes that involve [...] because they bring such a lighthearted aspect to the show that’s definitely needed to break up the more intense scenes." [...] DVD Talk's Todd Douglass felt that Isaac and Miria are [...] "the uplifting and energetic component of [...] show," [...] feeling that it is entertaining to see how they influenced the events. Nick Hartel, also from DVD Talk, believed that it would be cruel not to mention them. He described them to be filled with [...] "a maniac energy, often brought to a screeching halt by melodramatic breakdowns over trivial occurrences or bold assumptions." [...] Although he admit they seem to have to place in the series at first, he notes that their interactions with other characters [...] "causes a drastic shift in tone." [...] He comments that as the plot progresses, the pair [...] "become a bright spot as storylines take dark turns and serve as a reminder of the goodness that makes up the vast majority of the world." [...] Daryl Surat of the Anime World Order Podcast and quest Mike Toole believed that out of every other character in the ensemble cast, the pair are the [...] "default protagonists" [...] simply because they meet every other character. They also felt that if ignorance is bliss, they are the happiest people [...] "in the world" [...] because they are [...] "that stupid". The two characters were compared to Bonnie and Clyde, but the reviewers felt that were more like Blue Falcon and Dynomutt, characters from the animated series Dynomutt, Dog Wonder. Even if the events become grim, the reviewers could not <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>smile</b> as Isaac and Miria appear. ANN columnist Erin Finnegan described Isaac and Miria as [...] " [...] a couple of completely loveable weirdoes". She agreed that the subplot revolving around them [...] "takes some of the edge off the dark moments." [...] Amanda Tarbet of SequentialTart.com drew parallels between the duo and the trickster god archetype. She compared them to the kitsune of Japanese folklore, which are portrayed [...] "as tricksters, but also as nurturing characters such as guardians and friends". She felt that Isaac and Miria [...] "represent this duality perfectly." [...] Tarbet also described them as part Bonnie and Clyde and part Rodgers and Hammerstein.|$|E

She {{is one of the}} most powerful Beatrice users in the world, which is why she is sometimes targeted by assassins. Usually, Ayako is a very serious girl, who has never been known to smile around others. However, whenever she is around Mamoru, she can't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> blush and <b>smile</b> a little. Ayako ends up being Mamoru's girlfriend after their first fight with an enemy. Ayako's parents thought of her as a freak and abandoned her. She grew up living alone with a caretaker in her grandfather's mansion, which may help to explain her asocial personality prior to meeting Mamoru.|$|R

It would later be revealed that he has an internal wife called Pat, can self-reproduce throughout the summer months, collects stickers from car parks, was formerly the lead singer in the pop group Japan, has a pet jellyfish called Peter and plays the Bontempi organ. Les also had a fixation with mangoes and was later accompanied by a sycophantic little robot called Dylan.|$|R

40|$|Institution {{and many}} months {{traveling}} around the world, {{he was one of}} those professors who would find a place that he likes and stay. Dr. Lave was at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh for four decades, where he was a University Professor and the Harry B. and James H. Higgins Professor of Economics and Finance. He was the major adviser to more than 40 doctoral students. They admired him for his great intelligence and willingness to spend time with them. For illustrations, see Revkin’s tribute to Lester published in the New York Times (1) and a web recounting of how he would ask his students to explain their work during a one-minute ride in an elevator. (2) These reflections cannot <b>help</b> <b>but</b> bring a <b>smile</b> to your face. I know from personal experience that he could ask penetrating questions that would make you think hard about what you were advocating or doing, but his style was gentlemanly and his motives were constructive.

Eventually, the sports car creeps back into view [...] the driver has run out of shoulder and signals to be let in. Instead of giving way, you stare ahead and accelerate, inching dangerously close to the bumper in front of you. After squeezing back the intruder, you can't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> notice a <b>smile</b> creep onto your face. Judges worry, whereas filmmakers delight, {{in the fact that}} revenge feels good. Evolutionary theorists argue that such an "eye-for-an-eye " strategy makes sense, preventing future damage to one's self or kin (1, 2). Yet, in cases ranging from inconsiderate drivers to Nazi war criminals, even unrelated onlookers seem highly motivated to seek revenge, often in spite of personal cost. From the standpoint of self-interest, punishing those who violate the interests of strangers [...] a form of revenge called altruistic punishment [...] seems irrational.

6000|$|The {{negotiations}} terminated with ungentlemanly {{language on}} his part, and [...] "The Stormy Petrels" [...] scattered, {{never to be}} foregathered together again above the troubled waters of humanity. Now-a-days, listening to the feeble plans of modern reformers, I cannot <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>smile,</b> remembering what was done in Chequers Street, St. Luke's, {{in an age when}} Mrs. Grundy still gave the law to literature, while yet the British matron was the guide to British art. I am informed that there is abroad the question of abolishing the House of Lords! Why, [...] "The Stormy Petrels" [...] abolished the aristocracy and the Crown in one evening, and then only adjourned for the purpose of appointing a committee to draw up and have ready a Republican Constitution by the following Friday evening. They talk of Empire lounges! We closed the doors of every music-hall in London eighteen years ago by twenty-nine votes to seventeen. They had a patient hearing, and were ably defended; but we found that the tendency of such amusements was anti-progressive, and against the best interests of an intellectually advancing democracy. I met the mover of the condemnatory resolution at the old [...] "Pav" [...] the following evening, and we continued the discussion over a bottle of Bass. He strengthened his argument by persuading me to sit out the whole of the three songs sung by the [...] "Lion Comique"; but I subsequently retorted successfully, by bringing under his notice the dancing of a lady in blue tights and flaxen hair. I forget her name but never shall I cease to remember her exquisite charm and beauty. Ah, me! how charming and how beautiful [...] "artistes" [...] were in those golden days! Whence have they vanished? Ladies in blue tights and flaxen hair dance before my eyes to-day, but move me not, unless it be towards boredom. Where be the tripping witches of twenty years ago, whom to see once was to dream of for a week, to touch whose white hand would have been joy, to kiss whose red lips would have been to foretaste Heaven. I heard only the other day that the son of an old friend of mine had secretly married a lady from the front row of the ballet, and involuntarily I exclaimed, [...] "Poor devil!" [...] There was a time when my first thought would have been, [...] "Lucky beggar! is he worthy of her?" [...] For then the ladies of the ballet were angels. How could one gaze at them--from the shilling pit--and doubt it? They danced to keep a widowed mother in comfort, or to send a younger brother to school. Then they were glorious creatures a young man did well to worship; but now-a-days-- ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This naked appearance, {{together}} with their miserable circumstances, was no very comfortable sight to my Spaniards, who, for their parts, I may venture, Sir, without flattery, to say, are men of the best behaviour, calmest tempers, and sweetest nature, that can possibly be; for they immediately ordered Friday's father {{to see if he}} knew any of them, or if he understood what they could say. No sooner did the old Indian appear, but he looked at them with great seriousness; yet, as they were not of his nation, they were utter strangers to him, and none could understand his speech or signs, but one woman. This was enough to answer the design, which was to assure them they would not be killed, being fallen into the hands of Christians, who abhorred such barbarity. When they were fully satisfied of this, they expressed their joy by such strange gestures, and uncommon tones, as it is not possible for me to describe. But the woman their interpreter, was ordered next to enquire, whether they were content to be servants, and would work for the men who had brought them hither to save their lives? Hereupon, (being at this time unbound) they fell a capering and dancing, one taking this thing upon her shoulders, and the other that, intimating, that they were willing to do any thing for them. But now, Sir, having women among us, and dreading that it might occasion some strife, if not blood, I asked the three men 'what they would do, and how they intended to use these creatures, whether as servants or women?' One of them very pertly and readily answered, 'they would use them as both,' Gentlemen, said I as you are your own masters, I am not going to restrain you from that; but methinks, for avoiding dissentions among you, I would only desire you to engage, that none of you will take more than one for a woman or wife, and that having taken this one, none else should presume to touch her; for though we have not yet a priestly authority to marry you, yet it is but reasonable, that whoever thus takes a woman, should be obliged to maintain her, since nobody has any thing to do with her; and this, indeed, appeared so just to all present, that it was unanimously agreed to. The Englishmen then asked my Spaniards, 'whether they designed to take any of them? but they all answered, No; some declaring they had already wives in Spain; and others that they cared not to join with infidels. On the reverse, the Englishmen took each of them a temporary wife, and so set up a new method of living. As to Friday's father, the Spaniards, and the three savage servants we had taken in the late battle, they all lived with me in our ancient castle; and indeed we supplied {{the main part of the}} island with food, as necessity required. But the most remarkable part of the story is, how these Englishmen, who had been so much at variance, should agree about the choice of those women; yet they took a way good enough to prevent quarreling among themselves. They let the five women in one of their huts, and going themselves to the other, drew lots which should have the first choice. Now, he that had the first lot went to the hut, and fetched out her he chose; and it is remarkable, that he took her that was the most homely and eldest of the number, which made the rest of the Englishmen exceedingly merry; the Spaniards themselves could not <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>smile</b> at it; but as it happened, the fellow had the best thought, in choosing one fit for application and business; and indeed she proved the best wife of all the parcel.|$|E
