Unique touches to the interior include an A-pillar gauge pod with boost, and fuel and oil pressure gauges. This modification is only available on the GT/SC conversion.Even the standard GT conversion gets Shelby <b>headrest</b> <b>covers,</b> special GT dash plaque and engine plate.

50|$|As {{the number}} of {{low-cost}} carriers has grown, these airlines have begun to compete {{with one another in}} addition to the traditional carriers. In the US, airlines have responded by introducing variations to the model. JetBlue Airways advertises satellite television. Advertiser-supported Skybus Airlines launched from Columbus in 2007, but ceased operations in April 2008. In Europe, the emphasis has remained on reducing costs and no-frills service. In 2004, Ryanair announced proposals to eliminate reclining seats, window blinds, seat <b>headrest</b> <b>covers,</b> and seat pockets from its aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The {{light blue}} back {{lighting}} {{introduced in the}} third generation was continued. Later models (1994 and on) also featured translucent speedometer and tachometer needles. All VTEC & SE models received leather interior. Also featured was an 8-speaker audio system (Gathers DSP 8 Speaker System) which included a center dash-mounted speaker and rear center subwoofer, while the U.S. version received only 7 speakers (center dash speaker not included). The Japanese version also included a digital climate control system. The Canadian version received some options which were not available in the United States. For instance, the Japanese Prelude had power folding mirrors {{as well as a}} rear windscreen wiper, while the Canadian market was the one to have heated mirrors and optional heated seats. The Japanese model came with optional Honda Access accessories such as Typus ski racks, under dash lights, <b>headrest</b> <b>covers,</b> a cabin air filter, and floor mats. Some of the Japanese domestic market fourth generation Prelude VTECs did not come with options such as a sunroof and 4-wheel steering, as it was possible to skip these options when buying in Japan. The fourth generation Prelude also shares some suspension components with the fifth generation (1994-97) Honda Accord. It also shares many suspension components with the 5th generation Prelude's that are not equipped ATTS system.|$|R
50|$|The main {{differences}} between the two are that the Caravelle was sold as an eight-passenger version, while the Combi was available as a nine-passenger version, the Caravelle was only painted in metallic colors, while the Combi was only available in non-metallic colors, and the Caravelle was fitted with an AM/FM stereo cassette sound system, tinted windows, velour upholstery, reading lights, mid and rear <b>headrests,</b> and wheel <b>covers</b> from the European T25 model.|$|R
40|$|When {{implementing}} a managed healthcare intervention among a working population, evidence-based healthcare is critical. In the current study, {{the change of}} work posture of sewing-machine operators from seated to stand-up (the intervention) was managed within a physiotherapy and ergonomics programme (programme) in Johnson Controls Automotive S. A. (Pty) Ltd (company) without local evidence to guide the postural transition. The management of the intervention, implemented {{over a period of}} 4. 5 years, presented the opportunity for a retrospective longitudinal study. The study determined the impact of the change in work posture on the incidence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) from June 2004 to January 2009 (period). The role of the physiotherapist in the programme was to deliver manual therapy to all sewing-machine operators with WRMSDs, and to provide a clinical - ergonomics service, {{as a member of a}} multidisciplinary team, to the company. The population of sewing-machine operators (n= 123) was described in terms of personal factors (e. g. age, medical history, musculoskeletal history, and body mass index (BMI)), ergonomic risk factors (e. g. work posture, force and duration) and overall incidence of WRMSDs. The associations of risk factors (personal and ergonomic) with WRMSDs, and work posture with WRMSDs among sewing-machine operators were statistically determined. The majority of the population (97. 6 %) was female, with mean age 42. 3 ± 8 years. At baseline, 17. 9 % were hypertensive, 3. 3 % had arthritis, 6. 5 % were diabetic, and the mean BMI was 29. 7 kg/m² (22 % of BMIs was normal). The largest proportion of the sewing-machine operators were sewing cloth and leather (79. 7 %) (compared to sewing cloth and vinyl), and the remainder performed forceful precision stitching (20. 3 %), including <b>headrest</b> <b>covers,</b> airbags and top stitching on the final product. Job rotation took place between forceful precision stitching and straight stitching (for 36. 6 % of the sewing-machine operators). p> The intervention was implemented within the study period. At baseline 100 % of sewing machine operators were sewing in the seated work posture. Early in the study, 17. 9 % of them changed their work posture from seated to stand-up, 30. 1 % changed to the stand-up work posture in January 2007, and 34. 9 % a year later. The last 17. 1 % remained seated till the last year of the study period. From July 2008, 100 % of the sewing-machine operators were sewing in the stand-up work posture. The results indicated two strong associations of risk factors and a change in work posture with WRMSDs. Obesity (specifically morbid obesity) was a personal risk factor for upper limb disorders and working in the stand-up work posture was protective for spinal disorders, compared to working in the seated work posture. Furthermore, the results indicated a high incidence of disorders (specifically of the spinal area and upper limb) during the first three months of the programme, as well as an increased incidence of lower leg disorders for the first and consecutive month of the change in work posture from seated to standing up. Lower limb disorders were specifically associated with obesity. The increase of lower limb disorders during the postural adaptation phase was temporary, and was addressed within the programme with proper shoe wear, silicone innersoles, supportive stockings and exercises. The combination proved to be effective in preventing and/or managing lower limb disorders. The outcome of the current study provided evidence on the incidence of WRMSDs, and associations between risk factors and work posture, and WRMSDs among sewing machine operators managed within the programme.
