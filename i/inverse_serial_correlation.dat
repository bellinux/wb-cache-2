40|$|Although {{infrequent}} {{trading in}} equity stocks is {{more prevalent in}} the United Kingdom (and other non-United States countries), we find that it is proportionally more important in explaining the degree of <b>serial</b> <b>correlation</b> in stock returns in the US than in the UK, in contrast {{to much of the}} existing literature. We show that infrequent trading cannot explain more than a small proportion of the <b>serial</b> <b>correlation</b> observed in monthly UK stock returns and hence, other explanations for return predictability must be sought. Many studies have shown that stock market returns in the UK and other international markets are substantially and significantly serially correlated. The success of an investment strategy that is based on the apparent predictability of returns depends on whether the <b>serial</b> <b>correlation</b> is truly random and period specific or due to time varying risk premia or to market microstructure effects. A frequently noted explanation for this <b>serial</b> <b>correlation</b> is market thinness or, more precisely, the infrequency with which a substantial number of UK stocks are traded. Non-synchronous trading results in a measurement error in the observed data for returns on individual stocks, portfolios and market indices. This measurement error generates <b>serial</b> <b>correlation</b> in the observed returns. Here, we assess {{the extent to which the}} observed <b>serial</b> <b>correlation</b> in returns can be explained by equity non-trading behaviour. This will reveal whether there is any residual <b>serial</b> <b>correlation</b> left to be explained by alternative sources.

40|$|Wavelet {{analysis}} {{is a new}} mathematical method developed as a unified field of science {{over the last decade}} or so. As a spatially adaptive analytic tool, wavelets are useful for capturing <b>serial</b> <b>correlation</b> where the spectrum has peaks or kinks, as can arise from persistent dependence, seasonality, and other kinds of periodicity. This paper proposes a new class of generally applicable wavelet-based tests for <b>serial</b> <b>correlation</b> of unknown form in the estimated residuals of a panel regression model, where error components can be one-way or two-way, individual and time effects can be fixed or random, and regressors may contain lagged dependent variables or deterministic/stochastic trending variables. Our tests are applicable to unbalanced heterogenous panel data. They have a convenient null limit N(0, 1) distribution. No formulation of an alternative model is required, and our tests are consistent against <b>serial</b> <b>correlation</b> of unknown form even in the presence of substantial inhomogeneity in <b>serial</b> <b>correlation</b> across individuals. This is in contrast to existing <b>serial</b> <b>correlation</b> tests for panel models, which ignore inhomogeneity in <b>serial</b> <b>correlation</b> across individuals by assuming a common alternative, and thus have no power against the alternatives where the average of <b>serial</b> <b>correlations</b> among individuals is close to zero. We propose and justify a data-driven method to choose the smoothing parameter-the finest scale in wavelet spectral estimation, making the tests completely operational in practice. The data-driven finest scale automatically converges to zero under the null hypothesis of no <b>serial</b> <b>correlation</b> and diverges to infinity as the sample size increases under the alternative, ensuring the consistency of our tests. Simulation shows that our tests perform well in small and finite samples relative to some existing tests. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004. ...|$|R
