[...] He {{received}} fatherly advice from his dad, and recalled: [...] <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> they've got the best fans, and it's a blast because every game is live or die for them. It's a great environment to grow up playing baseball, {{and learning how to}} play under pressure in front of all those people. He loved it, and I'm looking forward to it, too.|$|E
500|$|In June 2015, The New York Times {{reported}} that Hastert had approached a business associate, J. David John, in 2010, {{to look for}} a financial adviser {{to come up with an}} annuity plan that would [...] "generate a substantial cash payout each year." [...] This request was the same year that prosecutors say he agreed to start paying hush money to the person he allegedly committed misconduct against. John told the New York Times that [...] "I did not think much about it at the time, but looking back at it, it does seem strange. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> he needed to generate some cash." ...|$|E
500|$|By this time, the UKAEA {{employed}} some 40,000 {{people in}} offices, laboratories and factories scattered around Britain. Gowing {{knew little about}} atomic energy; she once remarked {{that when she was}} appointed, she [...] "didn't know an atom from a molecule". [...] This was rectified, and she won the respect of Sir Christopher Hinton and Sir James Chadwick, and became friends with Nicholas Kurti, Sir Rudolf Peierls and Niels Bohr. At one point she asked Chadwick what he intended to do with all the documents in wooden filing cabinets in his attic, and <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> [...] "burn them". Such heart-stopping moments led her to help establish the Centre for Scientific Archives in 1972.|$|E

500|$|Downey {{has been}} {{a close friend of}} Mel Gibson since they starred in Air America. Downey defended Gibson during the {{controversy}} surrounding The Passion of the Christ, and said [...] "nobody's perfect" [...] in reference to Gibson's DUI. Gibson said of Downey: [...] "He {{was one of the first}} people to call and offer the hand of friendship. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> 'Hey, welcome to the club. Let's go see what we can do to work on ourselves.'" [...] In October 2011, Downey was being honored at the 25th American Cinematheque Awards; Downey chose Gibson to present him with his award for his life's work, and used his air time to say a few kind words about Gibson and explain why he chose him to present the award.|$|E
500|$|During the credits, {{there is}} a final cut scene between Amelia and an Old Coot first {{introduced}} earlier in the campaign. At first, his comments regarding how her family must be proud of her seem out of place—then he makes {{a reference to the}} Circle and how she was able to defeat them in only one lifetime, hinting that he is indeed the original Morgan Black. [...] As the Old Coot walks away, his voice grows deeper with a more exaggerated Scottish accent, further supporting this idea. [...] It appears he has lived longer than the average person because he drank from the Fountain of Youth after Act I. Amelia then asks what <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> he replies with a knowing, [...] "Don't miss your train," [...] and then he walks away.|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{recorded}} around thirty new compositions with The Hawks, {{including some}} of the most celebrated songs of his career: [...] "I Shall Be Released", [...] "This Wheel's on Fire", [...] "Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)", [...] "Tears of Rage" [...] and [...] "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere". Two of these featured his lyrics set to music by members of The Band: Danko wrote the music of [...] "This Wheel's on Fire"; Manuel, who composed [...] "Tears of Rage", described how Dylan [...] "came down to the basement with a piece of typewritten paper ... and <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> 'Have you got any music for this?' ... I had a couple of musical movements that fit ... so I just elaborated a bit, because I wasn't sure what the lyrics meant. I couldn't run upstairs and say, 'What's this mean, Bob: [...] "Now the heart is filled with gold {{as if it was a}} purse"? ...|$|E

500|$|After {{assembling}} a playable demo of Flight Unlimited, the team requested assistance from then-US Aerobatic Team member Michael Goulian, {{who worked as}} a flight instructor at the nearby Hanscom Field. Because of the game's flight code, Goulian was able to execute aerobatic maneuvers within less than three minutes of playing the game; and he later performed his [...] "entire basic aerobatic routine". Blackley told PC Gamer US that, while Goulian disliked flight simulators, [...] "When he flew Flight Unlimited, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> 'pretty cool.' I was so psyched". Goulian assisted the team during the next year of development: he co-designed the game's flight lessons and advised the team on adjustments to the plane models. Aerobatic pilot Patty Wagstaff was also consulted. At one point, the team encountered problems while testing a maneuver in the game's Sukhoi Su-31, and Blackley was concerned that he would need to rework the game's physics code. However, Goulian phoned a colleague—a Russian pilot—who told them to compensate for the plane's abnormally large ailerons. Using his advice on flying the real-world plane, the team found that the maneuver worked correctly. Goulian endorsed Flight Unlimited and wrote the foreword to its official strategy guide.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence, and filmed in Malibu, California, {{during the week of}} October 29, 2002. Lawrence created the video's concept and told MTV News, [...] " [...] had a conversation on the phone and all he said was he wanted to have some dancing in it, but to do my thing. He told me what the song was about, but in a [...] as well. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> it was a kiss-off song and so I came up with this idea and he went for it". Lawrence added that he also included some details in the video, including a reference to Spears's tattoo, which Timberlake enjoyed. He explained that he and Timberlake did not mention names while creating the video, only discussing the song's general beats. Lawrence also revealed that executives of Jive Records were nervous about some aspects of the video, such as Timberlake's representation of a voyeur and the tone of some scenes he was portraying with a girl. [...] "That's the thing I liked most about this project, was that he was coming into it with a super clean-cut image with 'N Sync and he's such a nice guy and so handsome and what I was into doing was making him be a bit scary. Lurking around the house in the rain, throwing a rock through her window, being a peeping Tom, getting revenge and doing stuff that's not really what a nice guy does." [...] The music video for [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] was released onto the iTunes Store on April 28, 2003.|$|E
500|$|The {{office workers}} are stuck working {{overtime}} {{on a major}} assignment. After asking Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) to confirm {{that he has not}} made any plans for the evening in anticipation of the overtime assignment, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) calls corporate and declares that he is releasing the workers from overtime. Michael then proceeds to invite Jim and his girlfriend Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to join him and his girlfriend Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) for dinner at his condominium after Jim had previously turned him down nine times. When Jim begins to formulate an excuse, Michael reminds him that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> he hadn't made any plans. Jim begins to suspect that Michael fabricated the overtime assignment and the call to corporate just to maneuver him and Pam into coming to dinner. Michael also invites Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey), but excludes Angela's former boyfriend Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), much to Dwight's dismay. On a tour of the condominium, Jan shows the workspace from which she runs her candle-making home business. Jan's dominance in the relationship is apparent from the living arrangements; Michael sleeps on a small bench due to Jan's [...] "space issues", and his sole comfort is a very small [...] "plasma TV," [...] which he bought for $200. It is also later revealed that Michael underwent three vasectomies in the course of trying to please Jan. Throughout the evening, Jan plays a song by her former assistant, Hunter. Titled [...] "That One Night", the lyrics of the song strongly suggest an intimate encounter once occurred between Jan and Hunter.|$|E

6000|$|Mercy {{looked at}} him in unconcealed surprise. His strongly-felt {{interest}} in her was restrained within the strictest limits of good-breeding: he was unmistakably a gentleman. Did he really mean what <b>he</b> had <b>just</b> <b>said?</b> ...|$|R

"Bruce {{was very}} clever: he didn't issue {{me with an}} ultimatum, he didn't rant and rave or {{threaten}} me. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Tom Walley {{would be proud of}} you". Tom was my youth team manager at Watford and absolutely hated people being out of shape... It was a gentle hint, but I realised... I had to sort it out myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meetings at Paisley were tumultuous and Asquith was barracked by hecklers singing [...] "The Red Flag". Asquith {{was widely}} {{expected}} {{to lose his}} seat and did so by 2,228. He received 46.5 per cent {{of the vote in}} his final parliamentary election, a straight fight against Labour. Violet wrote; [...] "Father was absolutely controlled. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> to me, 'I'm out by 2,000'." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{this time}} Ramblin' Jack Elliott studied {{extensively}} under Guthrie, visiting {{his home and}} observing how he wrote and performed. Elliott, like Bob Dylan later, idolized Guthrie and was inspired by his idiomatic performance style and repertoire. Because of Guthrie's Huntington's disease, Dylan and Guthrie's son Arlo later claimed they learned much of Guthrie's performance style from Elliott. When asked about Arlo's claim, Elliott said, [...] "I was flattered. Dylan learned from me the same way I learned from Woody. Woody didn't teach me. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> If {{you want to learn}} something, just steal it—that's the way I learned from Lead Belly." ...|$|E

6000|$|After sitting some {{minutes in}} silence, and {{watching}} {{the progress of the}} chain, at which I now wrought more assiduously than ever, he inquired: [...] "Whether what <b>he</b> had <b>just</b> <b>said</b> would have the effect of making me entirely detest him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "WE'RE all right!" [...] Maisie echoed devoutly. But {{the next}} moment, {{in the light}} of what <b>he</b> had <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> she asked: [...] "How shall I ever leave you?" [...] It was as if she must somehow take care of him.|$|R
2500|$|In Heath and Potter's book , Kinkade's work is {{described}} as [...] "so awful it must {{be seen to be}} believed." [...] In Dana Spiotta's 2011 novel Stone Arabia, the main character's boyfriend, an art teacher at a private school in Los Angeles, gives her presents of Thomas Kinkade Painter of Light pieces. [...] "When I asked him why Thomas Kinkade, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> 'Well, he is America's most successful artist. And a native Californian as well.' Or he would say, 'His name has a trademark— see?' and he would point to the subscript that appeared after his name." [...] The pieces are [...] "deeply hideous" [...] and [...] "kitschy," [...] but for some reason she loves them.|$|E
2500|$|Levy {{and many}} others have {{supported}} Dylan {{in the context of}} a larger, older blues and folk tradition of songwriters evolving old songs into new ones, which Dylan was no stranger to in the 1960s. Pete Seeger himself has previously expressed the view that Dylan is a link in this chain of folk and blues songwriters. Seeger has spoken many times about the folk process, often recounting that his friend Woody Guthrie once said to him [...] "That guy stole that from me, but I steal from everybody". Ramblin' Jack at one time expressed similar sentiments: [...] "Dylan learned from me the same way I learned from Woody. Woody didn't teach me. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> 'If you want to learn something, just steal it—that's the way I learned from Lead Belly'".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with All About Soap Richie revealed how Alfie reacts. He commented: [...] "It's {{the last thing he}} expected to hear. He didn't see it coming. He's upset and angry, especially when Kat tries to explain how he made her feel when he accused her of sleeping with someone else when she got pregnant again. He obviously didn't mean the things he said then – <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> them {{in the heat of the}} moment, but those words have stuck with Kat." [...] Asked whether Alfie appreciates Kat's honesty, he replied: [...] "Not at all – he'd rather not know. Deep down, Alfie knows that Kat has done things in the past that maybe she shouldn't have, but he didn't know all the details. Now he knows Kat has been unfaithful, he has got to confront the fact. The jury is still out on that one," [...] he explained. [...] "I don't know, if I'm honest. They always seem to take two steps forward and then one step back... They do tend to come through these things, so who knows?" ...|$|E
60|$|She made no reply; {{she showed}} no sign of feeling at what <b>he</b> had <b>just</b> <b>said.</b> Her head sank a little; her hands clasped {{themselves}} on her lap; the obstinate resignation which can submit to anything hardened her face, stiffened her figure--and that was all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poke, at your service." [...] He {{pronounced}} the word slowly and very distinctly, as if what <b>he</b> had <b>just</b> <b>said</b> of his self-confidence were true.

60|$|Strongly {{interested}} by this time, {{in studying}} Captain Bennydeck's character {{on the side}} of it which was new to him, Randal owned that he observed with surprise the interest which his friend felt in perfect strangers.

2500|$|In {{spite of}} his overt idiocy, Beavis {{possesses}} a number of character strengths. He can be inadvertently witty and, when discussing subjects that neither he nor Butt-Head understand, he {{is more likely to}} guess the actual mechanisms at work. Also, on the rare occasion that a female exhibits interest in one of the duo, it is usually Beavis who gets the attention. This could be because of Beavis' somewhat childlike temperament, which is less off-putting than Butt-Head's crasser, more blatantly sexual approaches. For example, when the two encounter members of the opposite sex, Butt-Head will typically lead off with a smug opening line such as [...] "Hey, baby", which invariably flops; Beavis, on the other hand, will usually approach the woman with a less obvious [...] "Hi!" [...] or [...] "Hey, how's it going?". Easily influenced by Butt-Head, however, Beavis will often imitate his buddy's cruder pick-up lines. Beavis has also shown instances of insight on such topics as the true meaning of Christmas, or in his analysis of a video by Korn. However, in both instances Beavis seems to be either in a trance or possessed, and shortly afterward he displays no recollection of what <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On June 30, 2013, del Toro {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} developing Hellboy 3 at Legendary Pictures. He stated: [...] "I hate giving pieces about it, but last night, we were at dinner and Ron said, 'I would be very happy to do Hellboy again, when are we doing Hellboy 3? Thomas Tull said, 'I {{would love to see}} Hellboy 3.' He didn't say he would love to do it <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> he'd like to see it, but today, I'll ask him." [...] Ron Perlman added his support for the idea, stating: [...] "Not just anybody can make this movie. I loved working for Legendary and I know for Guillermo working on Pacific Rim was one of his greatest experiences. The reason I loved working for them is because Guillermo was so happy. I came in six months into the shoot and he seemed as fresh as a daisy, simply because he was working for someone who appreciated and supported his outlandish visions of what he wanted to put on the screen. My immediate, silent wish was, wouldn't it be great if these guys came in and helped resolve the Hellboy series." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sapp was {{scheduled}} to fight at K1 Dynamite!! 2010. He was set to battle Shinichi Suzukawa on New Year's Eve in a Pancrase-style matchup, but pulled out {{at the last minute}} due to contract disputes. When questioned about Sapp's refusal to fight {{on the day of the}} event, FEG President Sadaharu Tanikawa asked, [...] "Does anyone actually care? I don't know the reasons why, but we did our best to make him fight. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> he didn't want to. This is typical [...]" [...] But Sapp claims that the promoters were contracted to pay him $30,000 for the fight, but that Tanikawa offered him $15,000 shortly after he arrived in Japan for the event. Sapp refused to fight for half of the original purse. [...] In response, he [...] "should not be considered as a normal person" [...] and is [...] "the worst, most lamentable dust man." [...] Tanikawa went on to say via Twitter that [...] "No one cares anymore, but the Sapp incident had NOTHING to do with the fight money … That guy is such a loser. He is one lonely man." ...|$|E
60|$|This guide, Glendinning, {{had become}} acquainted with Black {{at a time when}} the latter resided in Lanarkshire, and, as <b>he</b> had <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> was unacquainted with the region through which they now {{travelled}} beyond the river Cluden.
