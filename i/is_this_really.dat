25|$|In the {{discussion}} of special relativity, forces played {{no more than a}} background role. Special relativity assumes the ability to define inertial frames that fill all of spacetime, all of whose clocks run {{at the same rate as}} the clock at the origin. <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>really</b> possible? In a nonuniform gravitational field, experiment dictates that the answer is no. Gravitational fields make it impossible to construct a global inertial frame. In small enough regions of spacetime, local inertial frames are still possible. General relativity involves the systematic stitching together of these local frames into a more general picture of spacetime.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} towards [...] "Fight for This Love" [...] {{has been}} mixed. Ruth Harrison from 'Female First' {{was impressed by}} the song after initially being worried that Cole {{would not be able to}} cope going solo. She said [...] "Whilst it does sound just a little bit Girls Aloud-y, we still love it, and can see it being a huge hit on the club circuit up and down the country ... we think this is going to send her well on her way to global superstardom." [...] Popjustice also liked the song saying [...] "'Fight For This Love' is very definitely not just a Girls Aloud single with one person singing it... its one of those songs you can have on repeat for an hour and a half without getting bored. One thing that hits you is - well, <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>really</b> what Cheryl sounds like? Vocally it's a big surprise... As it turns out, she sounds really great - strong, confident, direct. Like a proper pop singer. It's a sleek, powerful production..." ...|$|E
500|$|Manhunt {{is easily}} the most violent game ever made. It will likely be {{dismissed}} by many as a disgusting murder simulator with no reason to exist. But Manhunt also is the Clockwork Orange of video games, holding your eyes open so as to not miss a single splatter – asking you, <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>really</b> what you enjoy watching? Had Manhunt been poorly made, using the snuff film angle as a cheap gimmick, the game would have been shameful and exploitative. What elevates it to a grotesque, chilling work of art is both presentation and game play. Manhunt is solid as a game; it's engaging to use stealth as you creep {{through the streets of}} this wicked city, using your smarts to avoid death, while dishing out much of your own. It's Ubisoft's Splinter Cell meets the cult Faces of Death videos [...] If Manhunt succeeds at retail, it will say more about America's fascination with violence than any political discourse or social debate. That makes Manhunt the most important video game of the last five years.|$|E

I'd not really thought about that stuff, because it had always <b>been</b> <b>this</b> <b>really</b> personal thing. But it was really exciting, and it's really cool to be a part of that." ...|$|R
500|$|Rousseau's unknown fate in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] {{was heavily}} {{discussed}} among critics. [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{felt that the}} relationship between Rousseau and Alex after their reunion remained unexplored, which made Rousseau's death a wasted opportunity for a powerful death scene. BuddyTV's Don Williams believed that Rousseau would survive, mainly because he had been waiting to see her flashback for four seasons, and thought her death would ensure it would not happen. Dan Compora from SyFy Portal was disappointed in her death scene, noting, [...] "I wasn't shocked to see Danielle get killed, but the scene felt like it was tossed in just in case this had to serve as the season finale." [...] Compora felt that Rousseau deserved more screen time in the episode leading up to her death. [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman described it as [...] "a rude and lazy {{way to get rid of}} Rousseau". John Kubicek, also of BuddyTV, found her death scene unsatisfactory, commenting, [...] "Then we have that entirely tacked on scene at the end which felt so artificial, like I accidentally flipped over to a different show. While I agree Danielle Rousseau being shot with an arrow is shocking, <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>really</b> what the show has come to? Arbitrarily putting a recurring character's life in peril to pose as a cliffhanger?" ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the latter}} half of his argument, he {{addressed}} the lesser-included issue. At trial, the jury had deliberated for three hours. Since Schmuck had admitted to the odometer tampering, [...] "the only thing the jury could have been out considering was <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>really</b> mail fraud. Are these mailings really sufficiently closely related to what my client was trying to do to be mail fraud?" [...] he posited them asking themselves. [...] "I think it's clear from that record that a lesser instruction on odometer tampering had at least an arguable chance of success." [...] The justices asked no questions, and Steinberg asked to reserve his remaining time for rebuttal.|$|E

She praised the album's [...] "ridiculously good vibes," [...] which leave you [...] "smiling". In addition, {{she noted that}} the music is [...] "full of passion and fun, making them such an easily liked band". Melodic {{reviewer}} Tom Spinelli compared the album to the Put Up or Shut Up EP, calling it [...] "full of energy and life". He noted that the album displays [...] "a mature step forward in the [...] "pop punk genre". In a negative review for Punknews.org, mikexdude said the group created an [...] "uninspired disc devoid of any authenticity with So Wrong, It's Right". Around halfway into the album, he said the band [...] "successfully removed all the remaining endearing qualities of the genre. <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>really</b> what pop-punk is like now?
