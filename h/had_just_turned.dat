5|$|Lorde was {{discovered}} by A representative Scott MacLachlan of Universal Music Group (UMG) {{at the age of}} 12, when MacLachlan saw footage of Lorde performing at a school talent show in Auckland, New Zealand. At the age of 13, Lorde started writing songs herself. MacLachlan unsuccessfully tried to set up Lorde with several songwriters and producers to help her with production. Ultimately, he paired Lorde with Joel Little in December 2011, when she <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>turned</b> 15. Little was impressed by Lorde's vocal performance and songwriting abilities, and he built songs with musical structures based on Lorde's lyrics.|$|E

He then lost in the semifinals to Rod Laver.

25|$|Livock {{was born}} in Newmarket, Suffolk, {{the son of a}} {{veterinary}} surgeon, and was educated at Cheltenham School. He <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>turned</b> 17 when the First World War broke out in August 1914, and his father was keen for his son to join him in his practice. However, young Livock had other ideas, and on 27 October 1914 he was commissioned into the Royal Naval Air Service as a probationary flight sub-lieutenant, and was posted to HMS Pembroke, for duty with the RNAS at Hendon. There, at the Grahame-White School, he learned to fly the Grahame-White Type XV biplane, and on 20 December 1914 was granted Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate No. 1004.|$|E
25|$|Sadaaki {{fought in}} the Boshin War (1868-1869), leading Kuwana forces during the {{fighting}} in northern Japan. He was together with Katamori until {{the start of the}} siege of Aizu, when Katamori asked him to leave and seek reinforcements from the other clans of the Northern Alliance. Sadaaki followed his brother's advice and headed for the Yonezawa Domain. After the fall of Yonezawa and the defeat of the Alliance, Sadaaki embarked on Enomoto Takeaki's warships at Matsushima Bay, and went on to the Ezo Republic. He was brought to Yokohama at the war's end, where he formally surrendered. After a few years in confinement, he was pardoned and released in 1872. It was soon after his release that he finally married Matsudaira Hatsu, who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>turned</b> 16.|$|E
25|$|After {{winning the}} toss, New Zealand chose to bat first {{and ended with}} a total of 262. Pakistan batted {{conservatively}} yet lost wickets at regular intervals. With the departure of Imran Khan and Saleem Malik shortly thereafter, Pakistan still required 115 runs at a rate of 7.67 per over with veteran Javed Miandad being the only known batsman remaining at the crease. A young Inzamam-ul-Haq, who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>turned</b> 22 and was not a well-known player at the time, burst onto the international stage with a match-winning 60 off 37 balls. Once Inzamam got out, Pakistan required 36 from 30 balls, which wicketkeeper Moin Khan ended with a towering six over long off, followed by the winning boundary to midwicket. The match is seen as the emergence of Inzamam onto the international stage.|$|E

25|$|Mowat {{trained as}} a lawyer. On January 27, 1836, Mowat, not yet sixteen years old, {{articled}} in the law office of John A. Macdonald, {{during a time when}} there was no formal legal education in the province. Macdonald <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>turned</b> 21. Early in their work relationship, Mowat and Macdonald were close friends, and worked successfully to build the legal practice. But they grew apart over time, as Mowat matured into a genuine rival of the older Macdonald. Mowat was mostly even-tempered and moderate in his behaviour, {{in sharp contrast to the}} firebrand Macdonald, who struggled with alcohol abuse for much of his life. As a young man, Mowat moved away from Kingston, eventually settling in Toronto, to develop his own career and life away from Macdonald's prominence.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt's plan to {{convince}} Hoover {{to run for}} the Democratic nomination fell through after Hoover publicly declared himself to be a Republican, but Roosevelt nonetheless decided to seek the 1920 vice presidential nomination. After Governor James M. Cox of Ohio won the party's presidential nomination, he chose Roosevelt as his running mate, and the party formally nominated Roosevelt by acclamation. Although his nomination surprised most people, Roosevelt was considered as bringing balance to the ticket as a moderate, a Wilsonian, and a prohibitionist with a famous name. Roosevelt <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>turned</b> 38, four years younger than Theodore had been when he received the same nomination from his party. Roosevelt resigned as Assistant Secretary of the Navy after the Democratic convention and campaigned across the nation for the Cox–Roosevelt ticket.|$|E
