25|$|Munroe {{figured that}} the best way to make pencils was by {{starting}} with a quarter inch slab of cedar wood. He then would cut the slots for his special formula graphite paste and fill them. He would let the paste air dry. The next step was to glue an eighth inch veneer of wood over the slots. The final step was to saw the slab into pencils. This resulted in a wooden lead graphite pencil that was just under a <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> thick.|$|E
25|$|The 2010 {{team was}} the first to wear white helmets since 1974. The white helmets were similar in design to the ones worn during the Jim Carlen era from 1970–1974 {{featuring}} a one-inch scarlet stripe in the middle bordered by two <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> black stripes. The helmets used in 2010 feature a black face mask instead of scarlet and the current version of the Double T. The helmets were worn for away games against the New Mexico Lobos, Iowa State Cyclones, and Oklahoma Sooners. The 2013 team saw a great expansion of uniform combinations and designs coinciding with Kingsbury's creative control over the uniforms.|$|E
25|$|Writing ink {{is usually}} {{water-based}} and {{is much less}} viscous than the oil-based inks used in printing. High quality paper, which has good consistency of absorption, enables cleaner lines, although parchment or vellum is often used, as a knife {{can be used to}} erase imperfections and a light-box is not needed to allow lines to pass through it. Normally, light boxes and templates are used to achieve straight lines without pencil markings detracting from the work. Ruled paper, either for a light box or direct use, is most often ruled every quarter or <b>half</b> <b>inch,</b> although inch spaces are occasionally used. This is the case with litterea unciales (hence the name), and college-ruled paper often acts as a guideline well.|$|E

25|$|There was a {{clear-cut}} incision on the neck. It was six {{inches in length}} and commenced {{two and a half}} inches in a straight line below the angle of the jaw, one <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> in over an undivided muscle, and then becoming deeper, dividing the sheath. The cut was very clean and deviated only a little downwards. The arteries and other vessels contained in the sheath were all cut through. The cut through the tissues on the right side was more superficial, and tailed off to about two inches below the right angle of the jaw. The deep vessels on that side were uninjured. From this it was evident that the hemorrhage was caused through the partial severance of the left cartoid artery.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, the MTA {{listed the}} 191st Street station among the 69 most {{deteriorated}} {{stations in the}} subway system. The station was completely renovated in 2003–2004 by the New York City Transit Authority. All of the deteriorating tiles and mosaics were replaced with exact reproductions of the originals made by Serpentile, a company that does reproductions of original subway motifs. The tiles are all unglazed porcelain a <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> wide. Each of the 72 columns had to be plastered and prepared for four-sided mosaics that wrap around each one. There are 72 vertical panels, and over 3500 linear feet of mosaics. New York City Transit construction crews did all of the tile and installation work. The station {{is also home to}} a mosaic tile piece of art titled Primavera by Raul Colon, accessible from the St. Nicholas Ave entrance to the station, or via the access tunnel on Broadway.|$|E
25|$|The front pin {{is known}} as the 'King' and is painted with a white, one and a <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> wide {{vertical}} stripe. The two pins to either side are known as the 'Quarter pins' and are marked with either a triangle or the numbers 1 and 2, in order to identify them. Traditionally the 'King' is the heaviest pin, with the 'Quarters' being heavier {{than the rest of the}} pins but not heavier than the 'King'. Directly behind the 'King' is the middle pin which {{is known as}} the 'Birdie', as the other pins form a 'cage' around it. The back pin sits directly behind the 'Birdie', the 'Back quarters' directly behind the 'Quarter' pins, and the 'Wingers' on the outside of the diamond. The 'Birdie', 'Back Quarters', 'Back Pin' and 'Wingers' are non-specific pins and are not marked so any of the six unmarked pins can be placed on any of the six plates.|$|E

25|$|Cryoablation: Cryoablation is a {{technique}} used to destroy tissue using cold temperature. The tumor is not removed and the destroyed cancer is left to be reabsorbed by the body. Initial results in properly selected patients with unresectable liver tumors are equivalent to those of resection. Cryosurgery involves the placement of a stainless steel probe {{into the center of}} the tumor. Liquid nitrogen is circulated through the end of this device. The tumor and a <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> margin of normal liver are frozen to -190nbsp&°C for 15 minutes, which is lethal to all tissues. The area is thawed for 10 minutes and then re-frozen to -190nbsp&°C for another 15 minutes. After the tumor has thawed, the probe is removed, bleeding is controlled, and the procedure is complete. The patient will spend the first post-operative night in the intensive care unit and typically is discharged in 3 – 5 days. Proper selection of patients and attention to detail in performing the cryosurgical procedure are mandatory in order to achieve good results and outcomes. Frequently, cryosurgery is used in conjunction with liver resection as some of the tumors are removed while others are treated with cryosurgery.|$|E
25|$|Despite that it {{was unusual}} for women to {{participate}} in archaeology at the time, in 1901, encouraged by Howard Carter, Lady William Cecil began excavations at Qubbet el-Hawa near Aswan. Her family was wintering {{in the area and}} while exploring on {{the west bank of the}} Nile had discovered what she thought might be an ancient cemetery. Carter, who in 1899 had been appointed by the Antiquities Service as one of two European Chief Inspectors and in charge of excavations in the Nile Valley south from Qus to the Sudanese border, came to see the find the following day. He arranged for permits to excavate and provided an inspector and workers to assist in the dig. She kept a diary of the details of the expedition in which multiple tombs were found, as well as wooden anthropoid coffins of the Saite Era. Though the entire necropolis was infested with termites, Tomb 21 yielded two burial boxes. The male's coffin disintegrated when it was touched, but the female's coffin remained intact and was removed. The exterior was painted in yellow and devoid of any inscription. The mummy was covered with a blue network of beading. A coarse blue glaze was used on the winged scarabs and Amenti gods depicted on the canopic jars. The sole adornment of the mummy was a one inch by <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> opaque green stone. Lady William's diary recorded that the names found in the tomb were Bao-bao, daughter of Pawebas and Shepentanefet and her brother Waher. She also reported remnants of a former burial, which may have been the tomb of Shepentanefret.|$|E
500|$|In January 1844, North Carolina Representative James Iver McKay, the {{chairman}} of the Committee on Ways and Means, solicited the views of Director Patterson on the gold dollar. [...] Patterson had more of Gobrecht's pattern dollar struck to show to committee members, again advising against a coin that if issued would be only about a <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> (13 mm) in diameter. [...] He told Treasury Secretary John C. Spencer that the only gold coins of that size in commerce, the Spanish and Colombian half-escudos, were unpopular and had not been struck for more than twenty years. [...] This seemed to satisfy the committee as nothing more was done for the time, and when a gold dollar was proposed again in 1846, McKay's committee recommended against it.|$|E

It was during this time that stagecoach robberies became frequent occurrences.

2500|$|Around 11:20pm, while {{preparations}} for the final act were under way, stage manager J. W. Thorpe saw a small flame on the left, or prompt side of the stage. The fire {{was coming from the}} lower part of a drop hanging below the rigging loft near the center stage border-light. The canvas was hanging, partially detached, from its frame and, Thorpe thought, somehow must have slipped past the wire mesh guard of the border lamp and ignited. He estimated its size to be no larger than his hand. Though water in paint buckets was once kept on hand on the stage and in the rigging loft and though a two and a <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> (...) water pipe still serviced a fire hose backstage, none of these facilities was readily available. Thorpe considered the fire hose, but there was much scenery in the way. He decided that the fire would be well under way by the time the hose was in place. He opted to extinguish the flame by whatever means were readily available. He directed carpenters Hamilton Weaver and William Van Sicken to extinguish the flame. They attempted this by beating the fire with long stage poles.|$|E
2500|$|In 1876 the Newhall {{railroad}} tunnel located [...] {{north of}} Los Angeles between {{the town of}} San Fernando and Lyons Station Stagecoach Stop (now Newhall) was completed, providing the final link from San Francisco to Los Angeles for the railroad.

[...] Many of them had prior experience working on Southern Pacific's located tunnels in the Tehachapi Pass. [...] Due to the sandstone composition of the mountain that was saturated with water and oil, frequent cave-ins occurred and the bore had to be constantly shored up by timbers during excavation. [...] The initial location for the north end of the tunnel near Newhall was abandoned due to frequent cave-ins caused by oil-soaked rock. [...] The north end of the tunnel excavation commenced in June 1875. [...] Water was a constant problem during construction and pumps were utilized to keep the tunnel from flooding. [...] Workers digging from both the north and south ends of the tunnel came face to face on July 14, 1876. [...] The bores from each end were only a <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> out of line with dimensions of [...] high, [...] wide at the bottom and over [...] at the shoulders.
