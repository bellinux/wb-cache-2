Class V cavities were prepared on buccal surfaces of 30 extracted human molars, with <b>gingival</b> <b>margins</b> 1. 5 [*]mm on the root. Prepared teeth were randomly assigned into 3 groups of 10 each and restored with Single Bond/Filtek Supreme using following techniques; Group I: oblique; Group II: occlusogingival; and Group III: split-increment. After restoration finishing, teeth were thermocycled, and immersed in 2 % methylene blue dye for 24 [*]h. Teeth were sectioned buccolingually. Digital photographs were made of sectioned surfaces using digital camera fitted on stereomicroscope. Microleakage was scored at occlusal and <b>gingival</b> <b>margins</b> using 0 – 3 scale. Dye penetration depth (DPD) at both margins was also measured using AnalySIS software. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni multiple comparison test. Results. 5 % of occlusal margins in Groups I and III had 50 [*]μm average (DPD). In Group II, only 10 % of occlusal margins showed dye penetration, with 60 [*]μm average depth. For <b>gingival</b> <b>margins,</b> Groups I and III presented dye penetration in 55 % of specimens, with 220 and 150 [*]μm average (DPD), respectively. Group II had 60 % of <b>gingival</b> <b>margins,</b> with 230 [*]μm average (DPD).

Our objective was to determine the differences in the perception of smile esthetics among orthodontists, general dentists, and laypersons with respect to alteration in the maxillary canine <b>gingival</b> <b>margin</b> in close-up smile analyses. Materials and Methods: Close-up photograph of an ideal Indian female smile was selected. The images were digitally altered to create symmetrical images with the <b>gingival</b> <b>margin</b> levels of maxillary canine matching the central incisors. Twelve alterations were created in the <b>gingival</b> <b>margin</b> of the canine with discrepancies of 1, 2, and 3 mm in relation to the most superior point on the labial <b>gingival</b> <b>margin</b> of patient's central incisor and divided under four groups. Finally, close-up images of the smile were assessed by orthodontist, general dentist, and layperson who indicated the level of attractiveness of each smile on a visual analogue score. The data collected were then statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Newman–Keul's range test. Results: Most evaluators considered all the three components, i. e., lips, teeth, and gingiva while assessing the smile's attractiveness. Statistically significant differences were observed between different evaluator groups when considering bilateral increase in crown height by 2 and 3 mm. The perceptions of asymmetries in the <b>gingival</b> <b>margin</b> levels of the maxillary canines were 1. 0 mm for orthodontists and 2. 0 mm for laypersons.

30|$|These {{findings}} {{correspond to}} the findings of Bernard et al. [18], Kuijpers et al. [19], and Jemt et al. [20] who reported that even if the implant is inserted after 19  years of age, the adjacent teeth and surrounding alveolar bone may continue to develop vertically and may continue to erupt resulting in infraocclusion of the implant restoration, i.e., a discrepancy between the <b>gingival</b> <b>margin</b> of the implant restoration and the <b>gingival</b> <b>margin</b> of the adjacent natural teeth may appear in a few years after treatment, and the implant becomes submerged. In cases where the upper and lower incisors are not in contact, the resulted extrusion might be 0 / 2 to 0 / 3  mm per year. Implants behave like ankylosed teeth, and their position cannot change in contrast to their neighboring natural teeth; therefore, even small tooth movements of adjacent teeth after implant placement can cause esthetic problems [21 - 23]. The disharmonious levels of the <b>gingival</b> <b>margins</b> resulting from infra-positioned implant restorations are an evident disadvantage in patients with a high smile line. Thus, ‘gummy smile’, or patients who show the <b>gingival</b> <b>margins,</b> is in our opinion a contraindication for implant substitution of the upper incisors [5].|$|R

METHODS: After 16 weeks of healing, implants (Osseospeed, Astra Tech Dental Implant) were positioned. Depending on the different fixture inclination and the thickness of buccal peri-implant soft tissue, abutment selection resulted in four groups: Group 1 (patients with zirconia ZirDesign(®) stock abutments), Group 2 (titanium stock TiDesign(®) abutments), Group 3 (zirconia cad-cam abutments), and Group 4 (titanium cad-cam abutments).

METHODS: Frontal photographs of the smiles of two adult women were used. Images were altered to create a symmetrical image with the <b>gingival</b> <b>margin</b> levels of the maxillary canines matching the central incisors and a 1. 0 -mm central-to-lateral incisal step. Later, the images were altered in order to create six different central incisor vertical positions in 0. 5 -mm increments. The images were randomly assembled in an album, which was given to 114 judges, 57 orthodontists and 57 laypersons, who were asked to evaluate the attractiveness of the images using the visual analog scale. The data collected were statistically analyzed by means of 1 -way analysis of variance with the Tukey post-hoc test and the Student t test. RESULTS: The highest rated smiles showed two notable characteristics: a) the central incisor <b>gingival</b> <b>margins</b> matched or were 0. 5 mm below the line of the canine <b>gingival</b> <b>margins</b> and; b) the central-to-lateral incisal step was 1. 0 to 1. 5 mm.

The teeth were randomly divided into 3 groups: (I) restorations with no rebonding, (II) restoration margins rebonded with an enamel adhesive (Margin Bond), (III) restoration margins rebonded with a specific unfilled resin. The specimens were then thermocycled and immersed in 0. 5 % fuchsin dye solution. The samples were sectioned longitudinally and observed under a stereomicroscope for assessment of microleakage.

40|$|Introduction: Microleakage {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} complications of direct tooth-colored restorations. One of the described methods to reduce microleakage is the use of bonding agents after finishing restorations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate microleakage associated with class V composite restorations while using rebonding on restorative margins. Materials and Methods: A total of 48 extracted caries-free human premolars were selected. Class five cavities were prepared on the buccal surfaces of all samples. Occlusal margins were placed in enamel while <b>gingival</b> <b>margins</b> were placed in dentin. Teeth were randomly divided into four groups of 12. Group 1 was considered as the control group, which was restored without rebonding. In groups 2, 3 and 4, after finishing and polishing, rebonding was performed by Prompt L-Pop, permaseal and Clearfil SE Bond on the restoration margins respectively. Specimens were thermocycled for 500 cycles, sealed with two layers of fingernail polish except for the occlusal and <b>gingival</b> <b>margins,</b> and immersed in fuschine 2 % for 24 hours. Specimens were longitudinally sectioned with diamond disk and studied under stereomicroscope. The data were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis and wilcoxon tests. (α = 0. 05). Results: Kruskal-wallis test showed no statistically significant differences for microleakage on occlusal (P value = 0. 075) and <b>gingival</b> <b>margins</b> (P value = 0. 281) among the groups. Wilcoxon test showed significant differences between occlusal and <b>gingival</b> <b>margins</b> in Prompt L-Pop (P value = 0. 023) and permaseal (P value = 0. 026) groups, but between the other groups, this difference was not significant.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} <b>gingival</b> <b>margin</b> {{changes in}} the esthetic zone after immediate implant placement and provisionalization over 5 years with a custom anatomic provisional abutment. Materials and Methods: Single maxillary incisor immediate implant placement and provisionalization procedures, completed and followed between February 2006 and August 2006, were analyzed retrospectively. During clinical recalls at 3 months, 1 year, and 5 years, changes in <b>gingival</b> <b>margins</b> were recorded with clinical photographs and recorded in millimeters. Results: Forty-seven patients each received a single implant (19 central incisors, 28 lateral incisors) and were followed for 5 years. Implants and restorations had a 100 % survival rate during the study. The mean <b>gingival</b> <b>margin</b> changes (recession) were 0. 17 mm {{at the time of}} definitive restoration, 0. 27 mm at 3 months, 0. 30 mm at 1 year, and 0. 30 mm at 5 years. After 5 years, 24 of the 47 implant crowns had no significant gingival recession. All central incisor sites received 4. 3 -mm-diameter implants and had a mean change in tooth length of 0. 03 mm at 5 years. Lateral incisor sites (n = 28) received either a 3. 5 -mm-diameter implant (n = 20) or a 4. 3 -mm-diameter implant (n = 8). Lateral sites with the 3. 5 -mm implant had a mean change in <b>gingival</b> <b>margin</b> height of 0. 08 mm of tooth length at 5 years; lateral sites with a 4. 3 -mm platform displayed a mean change of 0. 82 mm of tooth length. Conclusion: This study suggests that implant diameter, gingival biotype, surgical technique, and/or the reason for tooth loss can influence the amount of gingival recession occurring over 5 years. Most recession occurred within the first 3 months, between implant placement/provisionalization and definitive restoration.

Material and Methods: The data derived from a 26 -year longitudinal study of a group of Scandinavian middle-class males characterized by good to moderate oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups. At each of 7 examinations between 1969 and 1995, the mesial and buccal surfaces were scored for dental, restorative and periodontal parameters. The mesial sites of premolars and molars of 160 participants were observed during 26 years (1969 - 1995). A control group with 615 sound surfaces or filling margins located more than 1 mm from the <b>gingival</b> <b>margin</b> in all 7 surveys was compared with a test cohort with 98 surfaces which were sound or had filling margins located more than 1 mm from the <b>gingival</b> <b>margin</b> at baseline (1969) and had a subgingival filling margin 2 years after (1971). Results and conclusions: The study confirmed the long held concept that restorations placed below the <b>gingival</b> <b>margin</b> are detrimental to gingival and periodontal health. In addition, this study suggests that the increased loss of attachment found in teeth with subgingival restorations started slowly and could be detected clinically 1 to 3 years after the fabrication and placement of the restorations.

After thermocycling and sectioning of the samples, the sizes of marginal gaps at <b>gingival</b> <b>margins</b> were measured in µm under a stereomicroscope. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare marginal gaps at P< 0. 05 level of significance. The means of marginal gaps were significantly different between the two study groups (U= 180, P< 0. 001), with higher means of marginal gaps in group 2 (with CHX disinfection) compared to group 1 (without CHX disinfection) (P< 0. 0005). Application of CHX for the disinfection of cavities in giomer restorations resulted in an increase in <b>gingival</b> <b>margin</b> gaps...|$|R
