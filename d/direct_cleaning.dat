40|$|Following {{successful}} {{pilot plant}} trials conducted {{as a research}} project by the Sugar Milling Research Institute (SMRI), full scale implementation of the process developed was begun in 1983 and continued in 1984. The processconsistsofa two stage treatment involving spraying a 25 to 30 % wlv NaOH solution, at 100 to I 05 'C, over the evaporator tubes followed by spraying a 2 % wlv solution of sulphamic acid at 70 'C. Experiences in the practical application of this process are discussed. It {{has been found that}} no mechanical cleaning need be done and it is expected that with optimisation of the process, <b>direct</b> <b>cleaning</b> costs will become competitive with mechanical cleaning costs...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{cleaning}} or {{activation of}} an electrically conductive layer (or a conductor line or contact pad) on a substrate {{or of the}} adjacent substrate surface is carried out by placing the layer in a gas-filled discharge space (3) between two electrodes (1, 2), positioning a dielectric (4) between the layer {{and at least one}} electrode (2) and applying a voltage between the electrodes to create a dielectrically hindered discharge through the dielectric, resulting in micro-discharges which effect <b>direct</b> <b>cleaning</b> or activation of the layer or substrate surface. Preferably, the dielectric (4) is diamond, a high voltage resistant ceramic insulating material such as ceramic, glass or porcelain, an insulating plastic such as 'Teflon' (RTM), PVC, fluorocarbon or phenoplast, or a surface coated with such materials. Also claimed is an apparatus for effecting a dielectrically hindered discharge, especially for carrying out the above process. USE - For removing contaminants, such as condensates adhesi ve or polymerisation residues, carbon-containing substances, metal oxides and metal hydrides, from the circuit lines or pads of circuit boards or electronic circuits prior to contacting with solder pastes, solders and passivating agents. ADVANTAGE - The process can be integrated into the manufacturing process {{to reduce the risk of}} re-contamination, acts extremely uniformly on the layer or substrate surface so that little or no heating occurs, is non-polluting and inexpensive, improves the mechanical, electrical and corrosion properties of the layer, can be localised at the layer to minimise substrate attack and avoids the need for fluxes or wet activation baths during subsequent soldering...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, ongoing daily dental {{cleaning}} {{to domestic}} dogs has been clinically evaluated by veterinary clinicians {{to be effective}} in the prevention of periodontal diseases including zoonoses, especially in the aging dogs. In this study, in order to improve the canine oral hygiene, we have compared the various dental cleaning methods {{based on the number of}} bacteria on the teeth using dental care products for dogs which are commercially available. In addition, we have isolated zoonotic bacteria of Capnocytophaga spp and then examined changes in the number of the bacteria after the dental cleaning. Of the seven methods of dental <b>cleaning</b> (<b>direct</b> methods; n= 4, indirect methods; n= 3), all the <b>direct</b> dental <b>cleaning</b> methods achieved a high rate of bacterial reduction and appeared {{to be effective in}} the prevention of periodontal diseases in dogs. The present findings indicate that ongoing canine dental cleaning significantly reduces intraoral bacteria as well as dental plaques, thus reducing the risk of periodontal diseases...|$|R

30|$|Current pig house {{cleaning}} {{procedures are}} hazardous {{to the health}} of farm workers, and yet necessary if the spread of disease between batches of animals is to be satisfactorily controlled. Autonomous cleaning using robot technology offers salient benefits. This paper addresses the feasibility of designing a vision-based system to locate dirty areas and subsequently <b>direct</b> a <b>cleaning</b> robot to remove dirt. Novel results include the characterisation of the spectral properties of real surfaces and dirt in a pig house and the design of illumination to obtain discrimination of clean from dirty areas with a low probability of misclassification. A Bayesian discriminator is shown to be efficient in this context and implementation of a prototype tool demonstrates the feasibility of designing a low-cost vision-based sensor for autonomous cleaning.|$|R
40|$|The {{requirements}} of the working and safety norms demonstrate significant need of increased efficiency and improved working conditions in cleaning confined spaces. This paper presents {{an overview of the}} existing technologies and solutions for cleaning large confined spaces. A special attention is <b>directed</b> for <b>cleaning</b> interior surface of confined spaces used mainly for storing bulk materials or liquids, such as silos. The cleaning technologies for confined space depend on several aspects as the build-up material, the surface material, the ambient conditions. Four cleaning techniques are presented in this paper. The mechanisms and robots related to the studied problem are surveyed and evaluated from the viewpoint of their capability to clean interior surfaces. The dominating majority of the existing cleaning equipment is constructed to serve cleaning the entire volume of the respective confined space (silo), but not for cleaning the interior surface...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{interesting}} theoretical {{developments in the}} study of international environmental problems over the past two decades, as scholars grapple to deal with the complexities and growing range of actors constituting the political realms of issues like climate change, biodiversity loss and other forms of environmental degradation (Morin and Orsini 2013). Most recently, Global Environmental Politics (GEP) _ has followed an emerging trend within critical International Relations (IR) that re-focuses scholarly attention on methods and the methodological approaches used to understand, generate knowledge and represent international political life (O’Neil et al. 2013). This chapter aims to review some of the key theoretical and methodological approaches and recent innovations within the field of GEP, and indicate how a turn to the sociology of international environmental relations, in particular the sociological approach of Pierre Bourdieu, may offer important tools for further unpacking and illuminating the power relations imbued in all international political activities <b>directed</b> at <b>cleaning</b> the planet. This is not only important for providing GEP scholars with critical tools to deconstruct the politics of global environmental degradation, but also because this field offers a key site for understanding patterns of social domination structuring contemporary international political order...|$|R
40|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} and viral mRNAs, {{in which}} the first transcribed nucleotide is an adenosine, are decorated with a cap- 1 structure, 7 MeG 5 ′-ppp 5 ′-A 2 ′OMe. The positive-sense RNA genomes of flaviviruses (Dengue, West Nile virus) for example show strict conservation of the adenosine. We set out to produce GpppA- and 7 MeGpppA-capped RNA oligonucleotides for non-radioactive mRNA cap methyltransferase assays and, in perspective, for studies of enzyme specificity in relation to substrate length {{as well as for}} co-crystallization studies. This study reports the use of a bacteriophage T 7 DNA primase fragment to synthesize GpppACn and 7 MeGpppACn (1 [*]≤[*]n[*]≤[*] 9) in a one-step enzymatic reaction, followed by <b>direct</b> on-line <b>cleaning</b> HPLC purification. Optimization studies show that yields could be modulated by DNA template, enzyme and substrate concentration adjustments and longer reaction times. Large-scale synthesis rendered pure (in average 99 %) products (1 [*]≤[*]n[*]≤[*] 7) in quantities of up to 100 [*]nmol starting from 200 [*]nmol cap analog. The capped RNA oligonucleotides were efficient substrates of Dengue virus (nucleoside- 2 ′-O-) -methyltransferase, and human (guanine-N 7) -methyltransferase. Methyltransfer reactions were monitored by a non-radioactive, quantitative HPLC assay. Additionally, the produced capped RNAs may serve in biochemical, inhibition and structural studies involving a variety of eukaryotic and viral methyltransferases and guanylyltransferases...|$|R
50|$|Cleaning gobies {{generally}} service a {{wide range}} of clients; however, members of the genus Elacatinus are considered the most specialized cleaner gobies in tropical western Atlantic. Most frequent clients of Elacatinus include damselfish, Pomacentridae and grunts, Haemulidae and planktivores. Rather than seeking their client actively, they remain close to their cleaning station and seldom move more than a meter laterally. They do, however, dance in zig-zag swimming pattern to attract clients. Hosts come to the cleaning sites and pose to show their intent to receive service. Such poses are usually <b>directed</b> at the <b>cleaning</b> station rather than the individual gobies. However, not all the potential clients, or those who pose, are attended by cleaners. Duration of cleaning may range from couple seconds up to almost half an hour. In observational studies, decrease in cleaning frequency turned out to be correlated to increase in cleaning durations. The rate of feeding and cleaning duration most likely reflects the number of parasites on clients' bodies.|$|R
40|$|Interfacial {{tension and}} surface tension are {{properties}} of surfactants and surfactant {{systems that have}} been studied extensively. Aqueous formulations conmining surfactants are being investigated as altematives to solvents used to clean metal parts. Correlation between properties, such as the interfacial tension of a formulation and its cleaning efficiency is an important consideration. The end user is interested in this correlation in order to evaluate an appropriate aqueous cleaner. The formulator {{is interested in the}} most efficient surfactant or blend of surfactants which will produce a high performance cleanex. Although “textbook ” theory on surface activity and surfactants is comprehensive, <b>direct</b> correlation to <b>cleaning</b> performance in a typical aqueous system has yet to be determined. Surface tension has been used as an indication of a surfactant’s ability to wet the soil to be removed. Interfacial tension has been understood to be an indication of a surfactant’s capability to emulsify. Either value varies widely depending upon the soil being used. Therein lies a major difficulty when trying to correlate cleaning performance to surface activity...|$|R
40|$|Background Few {{guidelines}} {{exist for}} the initial management of wounds in disaster settings. As wounds sustained are often contaminated, {{there is a high}} risk of further complications from infection, both local and systemic. Healthcare workers with little to no surgical training often provide early wound care, and where resources and facilities are also often limited, and clear appropriate guidance is needed for early wound management. Methods We undertook a systematic review focusing on the nature of wounds in disaster situations, and the outcomes of wound management in recent disasters. We then presented the findings to an international consensus panel with a view to formulating a guideline for the initial management of wounds by first responders and subsequent healthcare personnel as they deploy. Results We included 62 studies in the review that described wound care challenges in a diverse range of disasters, and reported high rates of wound infection with multiple causative organisms. The panel defined a guideline in which the emphasis is on not closing wounds primarily but rather <b>directing</b> efforts toward <b>cleaning,</b> debridement, and dressing wounds in preparation for delayed primary closure, or further exploration and management by skilled surgeons. Conclusion Good wound care in disaster settings, as outlined in this article, can be achieved with relatively simple measures, and have important mortality and morbidity benefits. © 2014 Société Internationale de Chirurgie...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAnimal {{cleanliness}} in dairy herds {{is essential}} to ensure hygienic milk production, high microbial quality of carcasses, good hide quality, and animal welfare. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify on-farm factors associated with dairy cattle cleanliness. The study also examined differences in risk factors and preventive factors between contrasting herds regarding cattle cleanliness. In total, 60 dairy herds, selected from a national database, were visited by 2 trained assessors during the indoor feeding period in February and March 2009. In Norwegian abattoirs, cattle are assessed and categorized according to hide cleanliness, based on national guidelines, using a 3 -category scale. Dirty animals result in deductions in payment to farmers. “Dirty” herds (n= 30) were defined as those that had most deductions in payment registered due to dirty animals slaughtered in 2007 and 2008. “Clean” herds (n= 30) were those that had similar farm characteristics, but slaughtered only clean animals during 2007 and 2008, and thus had no deductions in payments registered. The dairy farms were located in 4 different areas of Norway. Relevant information, such as housing, bedding, feeding, and management practices concerning cleaning animals and floors, was collected during farm visits. In addition, the cleanliness of each animal over 1 yr of age (4, 991 animals) was assessed and scored on a 5 -point scale, and later changed to a dichotomous variable during statistical analysis. Milk data (milk yield and somatic cell counts) were obtained from the Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System. Factors associated with dirty animals in all 60 herds were, in ranked order, high air humidity, many dirty animals slaughtered during the previous 2 yr, lack of preslaughter management practices toward cleaning animals, animal type (heifers and bulls/steers), housing (freestalls and pens without bedding), manure consistency, and lack of efforts <b>directed</b> toward <b>cleaning</b> the animals throughout the year. Additional factors associated with dirty animals in the dirty herds were water leakage from drinking nipples/troughs into lying areas, bedding type, and feed type. In the clean herds, additional risk factors were water leakage from drinking nipples/troughs and low milk yield...|$|R
40|$|Safe {{water is}} widely {{recognized}} as both a fundamental human need and a key input into economic activity. Across the developing world, the typical approach to addressing these needs is to segregate supplies of water for domestic use from water for large-scale agricultural production. In that arrangement, the goal of domestic water supply is to provide small amounts of clean safe water for <b>direct</b> consumption, <b>cleaning,</b> bathing and sanitation, while the goal of agricultural water supply is to provide large amounts of lower quality water for irrigated agriculture. A new third use of water is now being given more attention by researchers: small amounts of water employed in selected household enterprises. This third use may be particularly important for women. There is a potential, therefore, that provision of modest amounts of water to smallholder farmers can enhance household economic production, save labor time for women and girls, and improve family health. This paper adds to the emerging literature on the multiple values of improved water supplies [...] improved health, time savings, and small-scale production for individual farmers and collectives [...] for {{the case of a}} rural community in the western highlands of Kenya. With minimum external support, two groups in this community have managed to install and operate systems of spring protection and piped water to their members' homesteads. Members of those households, particularly women, have benefited substantially in terms of time savings, health and small-scale production. The experience of this community also illustrates some of the challenges that must be faced for a community to effectively self-organize the investment and maintenance of a communitybased water scheme. There are challenges of finance, gender relations, and conflict over scarce water supplies, group leadership, enforcement of community bi-laws, and policy. Data from a census of springs in the same area show that successful collective action for water management is unusual, but certainly not unique, in this region of Kenya. Although women emerge as the main beneficiaries of improved water management in the community, their substantial contributions are largely hidden behind social norms regarding gender roles and relations. Research methods need to carefully triangulate information sources in order to clarify the very substantial and active roles performed by women. Kenya's water policy should be modified to better recognize and facilitate small-scale community-based water projects...|$|R
