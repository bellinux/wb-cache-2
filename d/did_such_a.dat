25|$|Stanton was unnerved by Buchanan's ambivalence {{towards the}} South Carolina secession crisis, {{and wanted to}} stiffen him against {{complying}} to the South's demands. On December 30 Black came to Stanton's home, and the two agreed to pen their objections to Buchanan ordering a withdrawal from Fort Sumter. If he <b>did</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> thing, the two men, along with Postmaster General Holt, agreed that they would resign, delivering a crippling blow to the administration. Buchanan obliged them. The South Carolinian delegates got their response from President Buchanan on New Year's Eve 1860; the President would not withdraw forces from Charleston Harbor.|$|E
25|$|The trial {{documents}} show that many individuals were {{implicated in the}} plot. Chief among them were Queen Tiye and her son Pentaweret, Ramesses' chief of the chamber, Pebekkamen, seven royal butlers (a respectable state office), two Treasury overseers, two Army standard bearers, two royal scribes and a herald. There {{is little doubt that}} all of the main conspirators were executed: some of the condemned were given the option of committing suicide (possibly by poison) rather than being put to death. According to the surviving trial transcripts, a total of three separate trials were started, while 38 people were sentenced to death. The tombs of Tiye and her son Pentaweret were robbed and their names erased to prevent them from enjoying an afterlife. The Egyptians <b>did</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> thorough job of this that the only references to them are the trial documents and what remains of their tombs.|$|E

500|$|Gotye was {{initially}} {{reported to have}} been unimpressed with the Glee rendition of his song, but later stated that his words had {{been taken out of}} context. On April 22, 2012, two Australian newspapers, the Sunday Mail and the Sunday Herald Sun, quoted him as having said, [...] "They <b>did</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> faithful arrangement of the instrumentals but the vocals were that pop Glee style". The Mail's quote continued after a comma with [...] "ultra-dry, sounded pretty tuned and the rock has no real sense, like it's playing to you from a cardboard box." [...] The Herald Sun's continuation of the quote came after a period: [...] "It made it sound dinky and wrong." [...] Gotye said in an interview the next day that he had been referring to [...] "this xylophone hook in my song—it's kind of dinky not just in the cover version but the original song". He added, [...] "I thought it was really clever to transpose the song to two guys ... It was a great idea." [...] In an interview published ten days later, Glee executive music producer Adam Anders said that although the iTunes version of the song that the show released was [...] "very true" [...] to Gotye's, that in the episode itself, [...] "the reality is, it was drier".|$|E

2500|$|He spent {{close to}} a year before {{production}} dressing in Morrison-like clothes, and spent time at Morrison's old hangouts along the Sunset Strip. His portrayal of Morrison was praised and members of The Doors noted that Kilmer <b>did</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> convincing job that they had trouble distinguishing his voice from Morrison's. Paul Rothchild played Kilmer's version of [...] "The End" [...] for the band's guitarist, Robby Krieger, who told him, [...] "I'm really glad they got 'The End'. We never got a recording of that live with Jim and now we've got it." [...] However, Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek was less than enthusiastic with how Morrison was portrayed in Stone's interpretation.|$|E
2500|$|Comedian Freek de Jonge {{performed}} an 'election show' ('verkiezingsconference') {{on public television}} {{on the night before}} the elections. It was called [...] "De Stemming 2006" [...] (an ambiguous name which means both [...] "The Vote 2006" [...] and [...] "The Mood 2006") [...] In his ironic comedy show, which was totally focused on the elections, he ridiculed the candidates, making such a show a uniquely Dutch phenomenon. When asked whether this show would influence the upcoming elections de Jonge stated he would make a fool out of everyone, not favoring a single person. This was the second time he <b>did</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> show. The first one was in 2003, when it was the thirty-third best watched TV-programme in the Netherlands that year. This year, the show was watched by 2,016,000 viewers.|$|E

2500|$|He {{was elected}} as an Independent {{supporter}} of the National Government. Defying the advice of more experienced members, including Austen Chamberlain, he made his maiden speech on 4 December 1935, {{the second day of}} the opening session of the new Parliament. He protested to the Prime Minister, Baldwin, on a motion that would give precedence to government bills over private member's bills. He went into the [...] "No" [...] lobby alongside the members of the Independent Labour Party and fellow university member Eleanor Rathbone, but the motion was passed by 232 to 5. Churchill praised Herbert for his [...] "composure and aplomb", and also famously said: [...] "Call that a maiden speech? It was a brazen hussy of a speech. Never <b>did</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> painted lady of a speech parade itself before a modest Parliament." [...] During his speech, Herbert promised to introduce his Matrimonial Causes Bill into law by the end of the parliament.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} for The Hollywood Reporter, Arthur Knight wrote [...] "Coonskin is not anti-black. Nor is it anti-Jewish, anti-Italian, or anti-American, {{all of whom}} fall prey to Bakshi's wicked caricaturist's pen as {{intensely}} {{as any of the}} blacks in his movie. What Bakshi is against, as this film makes abundantly clear, is the cheats, the rip-off artists, the hypocrites, the phonies, the con men, and the organized criminals of this world, regardless of race, color, or creed." [...] The film is most critical in its portrayal of the Mafia. According to Bakshi, [...] "I was incensed at all the hero worship of those guys in The Godfather; Pacino and Caan <b>did</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> great job of making you like them. [...] One thing that stunned me about The Godfather movie: here's a mother who gives birth to children, and her husband essentially gets all her sons killed. In Coonskin, she gets her revenge, but also gets shot. She turns into a butterfly and gets crushed. [...] These [...] guys don't give you any room." ...|$|E

For me it was very satisfying. After I read it, I had to sit for five or 10 minutes, just reflecting and digesting, because it definitely makes an impact." [...] Emerson said: [...] Carbonell described the finale as being [...] "all about everyone’s resolutions." [...] Cusick said [...] "There are so many walks of life getting together to talk about the show and so many issues to be brought up and that's exactly what the ending will bring up.

2500|$|The {{role was}} recast with Jacob Young, {{who had left}} his role as Rick Forrester on The Bold and the Beautiful. Angela Shapiro, at the time President of ABC Daytime, stated: [...] "It is {{challenging}} to cast a character as intense and compelling as Lucky Spencer. We are fortunate to find a young actor with Jacob's charisma and talent." [...] Young assumed the role on February 25, 2000, almost a year after Jackson's last appearance, speculated to {{be an attempt to}} ease the transition between characters due to Jackson's popularity. Young commented: [...] "At first I was a little bit insecure about (taking the role after Jackson). But now that I've started to think about it, Lucky was such a great character, and Jonathan <b>did</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> great job that (fans) wanted him to come back. (Lucky) being in such demand, I think it was great that it opened up and allowed someone else to come in and give this character a shot." [...] In November 2000, Young guest starred on the FOX network sketch comedy series MADtv, making a small cameo appearance as the character. That December, Young announced he would not be renewing his contract, and last appeared on February 10, 2003. He cited a desire to pursue music and film work at the time, later admitting monetary contract disagreements as the reason he left.|$|E
