Such <b>insulation</b> <b>breakdowns</b> in High Voltage (HV) / Medium Voltage (MV) equipment typically involve arc-flash/fire hazards, posing safety threats. Moreover probable undelivered power and huge financial losses are also associated. Early detection of PD activity can provide warnings about pending insulation/device failures and hence, maintenance or repair activities can be scheduled before breakdown occurs. Moreover, clustering of PD due to different types of sources is of practical importance as it indicates the severity of defect and provides an insight into the time available for repair activities before complete breakdown. State of the art tools for electrical PD monitoring are expensive and cannot be economically deployed over a large network of HV/MV assets.

High voltage switch boards, particularly, 415 V and above exhibit an arc flash hazard to operators and facilities. Thus, this project focuses on the electrical quantification on such hazards and how the safety risk is managed by using adequate personal protective equipments (PPE). This is done so by utilizing the classical short circuit analysis approach and employing the IEEE 1584 Standard’s Arc Flash arcing current and hence the energy equations and cross-matched to the rating of the PPEs required for adequate protection and safety. This approach also determines the safe boundary parameter which presents the distance from these equipments where arc flashes don’t reach out. This electrical quantification is done manually using hand-calculations and solidified further using simulation tool namely SKM Power Tool. The simulation is much more in depth for calculation with detail switchboard parameters are input to output the desired results. This effort translates in adequately protecting people and properties from unwanted disasters by enforcing operators to wear proper PPEs during operations or maintenance.

5000|$|When partial {{discharge}} is initiated, high frequency transient current pulses will appear and persist for nanoseconds to a microsecond, then disappear and reappear repeatedly as the voltage sinewave {{goes through the}} zero crossing. The PD happens near the peak voltage both positive and negative. PD pulses are easy to measure using the HFCT method. The HFCT is a [...] "high frequency" [...] current transducer which is clamped around the case ground of the component being tested. The severity of the PD is measured by measuring the burst interval {{between the end of}} a burst {{and the beginning of the}} next burst. As the <b>insulation</b> <b>breakdown</b> worsens, the burst interval will shorten due to the breakdown happening at lower voltages. This burst interval will continue to shorten until a critical 2 millisecond point is reached. At this 2 ms point the discharge is very close to the zero crossing and will fail with a full blown discharge and major failure. The HFCT method needs to be used because of the small magnitude and short duration of these PD events. The HFCT method is done while the component being tested stays energized and loaded. It is completely non-intrusive. Another method of measuring these currents is to put a small current-measuring resistor in series with the sample and then view the generated voltage on an oscilloscope via a matched coaxial cable.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} some {{important}} aspects of steady state thermal stability in the insulation of HVDC cables. The resistively graded electric field distribution and the temperature distribution, under steady state, in dc cables, are interrelated. The dc conductivity {{is known to be}} a function of stress as well as of temperature. Reasonably convincing theories of electric stress and temperature distribution are now available in the literature. Until recently, the thermal runaway was believed, primarily, to be a consequence of an inordinate run away in the sheath temperature due to dynamic interaction with the ambient. While this premise is partly true, there are other overriding factors controlling the stability. This paper presents a detailed investigation on this aspect and it is shown that the multi-factor dependent dc conductivity alone causes the thermal instability, boundary conditions at sheath having a marginal role.

40|$|External overvoltages {{can cause}} several damages to a HV/MV substation, leading to <b>insulation</b> <b>breakdowns.</b> The {{appropriate}} {{protection of the}} substation against external overvoltages is critical, {{in order to ensure}} the efficient, reliable and safe operation of the system. Shielding wires, mast and surge arresters are the main parts of a lightning protection system. The current PhD project deals with the effective lightning protection of HV/MV substations, examining the impact of various factors on the magnitude of the developed overvoltages at different positions of the system. The influence of the equivalent circuit model of the various components to the calculated overvoltages is also examined. Moreover, the substation outage rate due to lightning strokes is calculated, considering shielding failures and back-flashovers. In addition, special issues are discussed, i. e. induced overvoltages and installation of arresters in parallel. In comparison with other studies, main contribution of the thesis is that does not focus only {{on the role of the}} grounding resistance, but examines the dominant influence of other parameters; the improvement of the lightning performance of the substation can be achieved by the appropriate adjustment of various factors of the system. The current work highlights also the advantages and drawbacks of each equivalent circuit model, providing a guide to other researchers in order to select the appropriate models. As far as the risk assessment analysis is concerned, innovation of the performed study constitutes the inclusion of the arresters‟ failure rate to the total substation failure rate, since their possible failure results in malfunction of the nominal operation of the system. The induced overvoltages arriving at the entrance of the substation are also calculated, examining the role of the lightning hit position, the waveform of the lightning current, emphasizing to the role of the installation position of the arresters. Finally, the need for good matching of the voltage – current characteristics of the arresters is revealed, otherwise, the expected equal sharing of the injected lightning current will not be achieved. The current Thesis indicates that the combination of the arresters in parallel does not influence the expected overvoltages, but has to do mainly with the absorbed energy by the arresters...|$|R

Because these systems measure both current and voltage, they also monitorpower and are able to identify problems caused by unusual operating conditions and identify causes oflost efficiency.Because model-based systems only examine the difference between actual and predicted currents,they effectively filter out all the normal electrical signals that are so apparent in conventional Motor CurrentSpectral Analysis (MCSA), leaving a much simpler set of signals to be analysed.Because these systems are based on the relationship between voltage and current, they deal well withinverter driven systems where the input voltage may be of a variable frequency and there may be a noisywaveform high in harmonic components. Model-based systems effectively filter out all this noise in thevoltage signal from the resulting current signal, leaving just the underlying imperfections.This ease of use and low cost of this type of equipment makes it appropriate for lower cost, lowercriticality equipment.|$|E
