5|$|Exposure may not {{be evident}} for eight hours for 50% HF, rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations, and a burn may {{initially}} be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function. If skin has been exposed to HF, damage can be reduced by rinsing it under a jet of water for 10–15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing. Calcium <b>gluconate</b> is often applied next, providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride; skin burns can be treated with 2.5% calcium <b>gluconate</b> gel or special rinsing solutions. Hydrofluoric acid absorption requires further medical treatment; calcium <b>gluconate</b> may be injected or administered intravenously. Using calcium chloride – a common laboratory reagent – in lieu of calcium <b>gluconate</b> is contraindicated, and may lead to severe complications. Excision or amputation of affected parts may be required.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of antivenom, benzodiazepines and intravenous calcium <b>gluconate</b> were used to relieve symptoms of pain and distress, although calcium is not recommended as its benefit has not been shown in clinical trials.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the Common Cold Unit {{was set up}} by the Medical Research Council in 1946 and it {{was where}} the {{rhinovirus}} was discovered in 1956. In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease, but no practical treatment could be developed. The unit was closed in 1989, two years after it completed research of zinc <b>gluconate</b> lozenges in the prophylaxis and treatment of rhinovirus colds, the only successful treatment {{in the history of the}} unit.|$|E
5|$|The element was {{probably}} {{named by the}} alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc <b>gluconate</b> (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous calcium <b>gluconate</b> is {{considered}} a specific antidote. Slow heart rate can be treated with atropine and sympathomimetics. Low blood pressure is treated with vasopressors such as adrenaline.|$|E
25|$|Male dogs – Neutersol (Zinc <b>gluconate</b> {{neutralized}} by arginine). Cytotoxic; produces irreversible infertility by chemical {{disruption of}} the testicle. It is now produced as Esterilsol in Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Calcium (calcium {{chloride}} or calcium <b>gluconate)</b> increases {{threshold potential}} through a mechanism {{that is still}} unclear, thus restoring normal gradient between threshold potential and resting membrane potential, which is elevated abnormally in hyperkalemia. A standard ampule of 10% calcium chloride is 10 mL and contains 6.8mmol of calcium. A standard ampule of 10% calcium <b>gluconate</b> is also 10 mL but has only 2.26mmol of calcium. Clinical practice guidelines recommend giving 6.8mmol for typical EKG findings of hyperkalemia. This is 10 mL of 10% calcium chloride or 30 mL of 10% calcium <b>gluconate.</b> Though calcium chloride is more concentrated, it is caustic to the veins and should only be given through a central line. Onset of action is less than one to three minutes and lasts about 30–60 minutes. The goal of treatment is to normalize the EKG and doses can be repeated if the EKG does not improve within a few minutes.|$|E
25|$|All {{versions}} of the GBP bypass the duodenum, which is the primary site of absorption of both iron and calcium. Iron replacement is essential in menstruating females, and supplementation of iron and calcium is preferable in all patients. Ferrous sulfate is poorly tolerated. Alternative forms of iron (fumarate, <b>gluconate,</b> chelates) are less irritating and probably better absorbed. Calcium carbonate preparations should also be avoided; calcium as citrate or <b>gluconate</b> (with 1200mg as calcium) has greater bioavailability independent of acid in the stomach, and will likely be better absorbed. Chewable calcium supplements that include vitamin K are sometimes recommended by doctors as {{a good way to}} get calcium.|$|E
25|$|In addition, as {{recommended}} in all dental traumas good oral hygiene with 0.12% chlorhexidine <b>gluconate</b> mouthwash, a soft and cold diet, and avoidance of smoking {{for several days}} may provide a favorable condition for periodontal ligaments regeneration.|$|E
25|$|Retarders {{slow the}} {{hydration}} {{of concrete and}} are used in large or difficult pours where partial setting before the pour is complete is undesirable. Typical polyol retarders are sugar, sucrose, sodium <b>gluconate,</b> glucose, citric acid, and tartaric acid.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{supplements}} {{can prevent}} copper deficiency, but supplements {{should be taken}} only under a doctor's supervision. Different forms of copper supplementation have different absorption rates. For example, the absorption of copper from cupric oxide supplements is lower than that from copper <b>gluconate,</b> sulfate, or carbonate.|$|E
25|$|Examples of oral iron {{that are}} often used are ferrous sulfate, ferrous <b>gluconate,</b> or amino acid chelate tablets. Recent {{research}} suggests the replacement dose of iron, {{at least in the}} elderly with iron deficiency, may be as little as 15mg per day of elemental iron.|$|E
25|$|Various factors {{influence}} copper absorption. For example, copper absorption {{is enhanced}} by ingestion of animal protein, citrate, and phosphate. Copper salts, including copper <b>gluconate,</b> copper acetate, or copper sulfate, are more easily absorbed than copper oxides. Elevated levels of dietary zinc, as well as cadmium, high intakes of phytate and simple sugars (fructose, sucrose) inhibit dietary absorption of copper. Furthermore, low levels of dietary copper inhibit iron absorption.|$|E
25|$|Triclosan {{has been}} {{associated}} with a higher risk of food allergy. This may be because exposure to bacteria reduces allergies, as predicted by the hygiene hypothesis, and not caused by toxicology of triclosan itself. This effect may also occur with chlorhexidine <b>gluconate</b> and PCMX, among other antibacterial agents. Other studies have linked triclosan to allergic contact dermatitis in some individuals. Additionally, triclosan concentrations have been associated with allergic sensitization, especially inhalant and seasonal allergens, rather than food allergens.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{treatments}} that may be useful. These include efforts to reduce absorption of the drug including: activated charcoal taken by mouth if given shortly after the ingestion or whole bowel irrigation if an extended release formula was taken. Efforts to cause vomiting are not recommended. Medications to treat the toxic effects include: intravenous fluids, calcium <b>gluconate,</b> glucagon, high dose insulin, vasopressors and lipid emulsion. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may also be an option.|$|E
25|$|Extensive or pancolitis. Patients usually {{require a}} {{combination}} of oral Mesalazine or sulfasalazine along with topical Mesalazine or steroid enemas. Oral prednisone (40–60mg/day) should be given only in severe cases or if oral Mesalazine fails. Once remission is induced, maintenance therapy is with standard oral Mesalazine doses. Supplemental iron (ferrous sulfate or ferrous <b>gluconate)</b> may be given due to chronic blood loss. Loperamide may be given for symptomatic relief of chronic diarrhea, but should not be given in suspected toxic megacolon.|$|E
25|$|Due to its similar {{structure}} and properties, pentavalent arsenic metabolites {{are capable of}} replacing the phosphate group of many metabolic pathways. The replacement of phosphate by arsenate is initiated when arsenate reacts with glucose and <b>gluconate</b> in vitro. This reaction generates glucose-6-arsenate and 6-arsenogluconate, which act as analogs for glucose-6-phosphate and 6-phosphogluconate. At the substrate level, during glycolysis, glucose-6-arsenate binds as a substrate to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and also inhibits hexokinase through negative feedback. Unlike the importance of phosphate in glycolysis, the presence of arsenate restricts the generation of ATP by forming an unstable anhydride product, through the reaction with D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The anhydride 1-arsenato-3-phospho-D-glycerate generated readily hydrolyzes due to the longer bond length of As-O compared to P-O. At the mitochondrial level, arsenate uncouples the synthesis of ATP by binding to ADP {{in the presence of}} succinate, thus forming an unstable compound that ultimately results in a decrease of ATP net gain. Arsenite (III) metabolites, on the other hand, have limited effect on ATP production in red blood cells.|$|E
500|$|In most single-tablet, over-the-counter, daily vitamin {{and mineral}} supplements, zinc is {{included}} in such forms as zinc oxide, zinc acetate, or zinc <b>gluconate.</b> Zinc is {{generally considered to be}} an antioxidant. However, it is redox inert and thus can serve such a function only indirectly. [...] As such, it may protect against accelerated aging of the skin and muscles of the body; studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc also helps speed up the healing process after an injury. Zinc deficiency compromises the human immune system.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{absorbed into}} blood through the skin, it reacts with blood calcium and may cause cardiac arrest. Burns with areas larger than 160cm2 (25 square inches) have the {{potential}} to cause serious systemic toxicity from interference with blood and tissue calcium levels. [...] In the body, hydrofluoric acid reacts with the ubiquitous biologically important ions Ca2+ and Mg2+. Formation of insoluble calcium fluoride is proposed as the etiology for both precipitous fall in serum calcium and the severe pain associated with tissue toxicity. In some cases, exposures can lead to hypocalcemia. Thus, hydrofluoric acid exposure is often treated with calcium <b>gluconate,</b> a source of Ca2+ that sequesters the fluoride ions. HF chemical burns can be treated with a water wash and 2.5% calcium <b>gluconate</b> gel or special rinsing solutions. However, because it is absorbed, medical treatment is necessary; rinsing off is not enough. Intra-arterial infusions of calcium chloride have also shown great effectiveness in treating burns.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fruit is}} a small drupe [...] long, thinner-fleshed and smaller in wild plants than in orchard cultivars. Olives are {{harvested}} in the green to purple stage. Canned black olives have often been artificially blackened (see below on processing) and may contain the chemical ferrous <b>gluconate</b> to improve the appearance. Olea europaea contains a seed commonly referred to in American English as a pit or a rock, and in British English as a stone.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{authoritative}} clinicians {{and researchers}} advise completing endodontic therapy {{as soon as}} possible, especially in situations necessitating incision and drainage, in order to remove the cause of infection without delay. [...] Recent studies have shown, however, that intracanal application of certain medicaments prior to the completion of endodontic therapy may produce highly favorable results when followed by conventional therapy, even when the periapical area is very large. The use of chlorhexidine <b>gluconate</b> and calcium hydroxide for infection control was shown to lead to substantial healing of a large periapical lesion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} homeopathic {{dilution}} results in no objectively detectable active ingredient in most cases, but some preparations (e.g. calendula and arnica creams) do contain pharmacologically active doses. One product, Zicam Cold Remedy, which was marketed as an [...] "unapproved homeopathic" [...] product, contains two ingredients {{that are only}} [...] "slightly" [...] diluted: zinc acetate (2X = 1/100 dilution) and zinc <b>gluconate</b> (1X = 1/10 dilution), which means both are present in a biologically active concentration strong enough to have caused some people to lose their sense of smell, a condition termed anosmia. Zicam also listed several normal homeopathic potencies as [...] "inactive ingredients", including galphimia glauca, histamine dihydrochloride (homeopathic name, histaminum hydrochloricum), luffa operculata, and sulfur.|$|E
2500|$|Mild CCB {{toxicity}} {{is treated}} with supportive care. Nondihydropyridine CCBs may produce profound toxicity and early decontamination, especially for slow-release agents, is essential. [...] For severe overdoses, treatment usually includes close monitoring of vital signs {{and the addition}} of vasopressive agents and intravenous fluids for blood pressure support. [...] Intravenous calcium <b>gluconate</b> (or calcium chloride if a central line is available) and atropine are first-line therapies. [...] If the time of the overdose is known and presentation is within two hours of ingestion, activated charcoal, gastric lavage, and polyethylene glycol may be used to decontaminate the gut. [...] Efforts for gut decontamination may be extended to within 8 hours of ingestion with extended-release preparations.|$|E
2500|$|Instances {{of arsenic}} {{poisoning}} have occurred after use of arsenic-containing homeopathic preparations. Zicam Cold remedy Nasal Gel, which contains 2X (1:100) zinc <b>gluconate,</b> reportedly caused {{a small percentage}} of users to lose their sense of smell; 340 cases were settled out of court in 2006 for [...] In 2009, the FDA advised consumers to stop using three discontinued cold remedy Zicam products because it could cause permanent damage to users' sense of smell. Zicam was launched without a New Drug Application (NDA) under a provision in the FDA's Compliance Policy Guide called [...] "Conditions under which homeopathic drugs may be marketed" [...] (CPG 7132.15), but the FDA warned Matrixx Initiatives, its manufacturer, via a Warning Letter that this policy does not apply when there is a health risk to consumers.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{pre-operative}} holding area, {{the patient}} changes {{out of his}} or her street clothes and is asked to confirm the details {{of his or her}} surgery. A set of vital signs are recorded, a peripheral IV line is placed, and pre-operative medications (antibiotics, sedatives, etc.) are given. When the patient enters the operating room, the skin surface to be operated on, called the operating field, is cleaned and prepared by applying an antiseptic such as chlorhexidine <b>gluconate</b> or povidone-iodine to reduce the possibility of infection. If hair is present at the surgical site, it is clipped off prior to prep application. The patient is assisted by an anesthesiologist or resident to make a specific surgical position, then sterile drapes are used to cover the surgical site or at least a wide area surrounding the operating field; the drapes are clipped to a pair of poles near the head of the bed to form an [...] "ether screen", which separates the anesthetist/anesthesiologist's working area (unsterile) from the surgical site (sterile).|$|E
5000|$|Calcium <b>gluconate,</b> in {{the form}} of a gel, is used to treat burns from {{hydrofluoric}} acid; calcium <b>gluconate</b> injections may be used for more severe cases to avoid necrosis of deep tissues, as well as to treat hypocalcemia in hospitalized patients. <b>Gluconate</b> is also an electrolyte present in certain solutions, such as [...] "plasmalyte a", used for intravenous fluid resuscitation. [...] Quinine <b>gluconate</b> is a salt between gluconic acid and quinine, which is used for intramuscular injection in the treatment of malaria. Zinc <b>gluconate</b> injections are used to neuter male dogs. [...] Ferrous <b>gluconate</b> injections have been proposed in the past to treat anemia.|$|E
50|$|Calcium <b>gluconate</b> {{side effects}} include nausea, constipation, upset stomach. Rapid {{intravenous}} injections of calcium <b>gluconate</b> may cause hypercalcaemia, which {{can result in}} vasodilation, cardiac arrhythmias, decreased blood pressure, and bradycardia. Extravasation of calcium <b>gluconate</b> can lead to cellulitis. Intramuscular injections may lead to local necrosis and abscess formation.|$|E
50|$|Zinc <b>gluconate</b> is the {{zinc salt}} of gluconic acid. It is an ionic {{compound}} {{consisting of two}} anions of <b>gluconate</b> for each zinc(II) cation. Zinc <b>gluconate</b> is a popular form for the delivery of zinc as a dietary supplement, {{in which case the}} name zincum gluconicum is often used.|$|E
5000|$|In aqueous {{solution}} at neutral pH, gluconic acid forms the <b>gluconate</b> ion. The salts of gluconic acid {{are known as}} [...] "gluconates". Gluconic acid, <b>gluconate</b> salts, and <b>gluconate</b> esters occur widely in nature because such species arise from the oxidation of glucose. Some drugs are injected {{in the form of}} gluconates.|$|E
50|$|Gel {{preparations}} {{of calcium}} <b>gluconate</b> {{are used to}} treat hydrofluoric acid burns. This is because calcium <b>gluconate</b> reacts with hydrofluoric acid to form insoluble, non-toxic calcium fluoride.|$|E
50|$|The {{intravenous}} {{formulations of}} calcium include calcium chloride and calcium <b>gluconate.</b> The forms that are taken by mouth include calcium acetate, calcium carbonate, calcium citrate, calcium <b>gluconate,</b> calcium lactate and calcium phosphate.|$|E
50|$|Potassium <b>gluconate</b> {{is used as}} {{a mineral}} {{supplement}} and sequestrant. It is sold over-the-counter as tablets or capsules providing up to 593 mg of potassium <b>gluconate,</b> thereby containing 99 mg or 2.53 mEq of elemental potassium. This is the permissible upper limit for each tablet or capsule of over-the-counter potassium supplements sold in the USA. Potassium <b>gluconate</b> is also sold over-the-counter as bulk powder.|$|E
5000|$|Iron(II) <b>gluconate,</b> or ferrous <b>gluconate,</b> {{is a black}} {{compound}} {{often used}} as an iron supplement. It is the iron(II) salt of gluconic acid. It is marketed under brand names such as Fergon, Ferralet, and Simron.|$|E
