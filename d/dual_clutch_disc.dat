40|$|We are {{interested}} in an automotive riveted <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> located in the clutch system. After gearshift and during the clutch re-engagement, the <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> allows to transmit a progressive torque through its axial stiffness. In order to ensure the stability of cushion curve during the lifetime of the system, we propose to perform a Finite Element model of the riveted <b>clutch</b> <b>disc.</b> The aim is to optimize the correlation between numerical and experimental results {{in order to obtain}} a prediction of contact pressures in the riveted <b>clutch</b> <b>disc.</b> This work will be the first step, leading to a framework for the drawing up of design rules for riveted <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> in term of stability. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology {{for the assessment}} of the NVH (noise vibration and harshness) performance of <b>Dual</b> <b>Clutch</b> Transmissions (DCTs) depending on some transmission design parameters, e. g. torsional backlash in the synchronizers or <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> moment of inertia, during low speed maneuvers. A 21 -DOFs nonlinear dynamic model of a C-segment passenger car equipped with a DCT is used to simulate the torsional behavior of the driveline and to estimate the forces at the bearings. The impacts between the teeth of two engaging components, e. g. gears and synchronizers, generate impulses in the forces, thus loading the bearings with force time-history characterized by rich frequency content. A broadband excitation is therefore applied to the gearbox case, generating noise and vibration issues. The metric used to assess the severity of a specific test and to compare, at least qualitatively, the NVH performance related to different design parameters sets, is based on the RMS (root-meansquare) value of each bearing force time-history. Variations from one test to another allow assessing the benefit introduced by specific design parameter modifications. Applications of the proposed methodology aimed at evaluating the effects of reducing the <b>clutch</b> <b>discs</b> moment of inertia, the synchronizers backlash and the internal backlash in the differential are presented. Finally the paper shows that results not only depend on the gearbox design but also on the specific maneuver chosen to excite the dynamic system under test: a clear trend may be seen in some cases while only negligible effects are observed in other condition...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{comparison}} of temperatures produced in a dry friction <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> with different materials during a single engagement to assist in clutch plate design and analysis. A study of usage of different materials for friction lining of <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> is required, which will provide improved performance and enhanced life. This investigation is modelled mathematically and solved numerically using finite element method. ANSYS® 15. 0 is a dedicated finite element package used for determining the temperature distribution across a <b>clutch</b> <b>disc.</b> In the present work, an investigation of a conventionally used harmful friction lining material asbestos is compared with carbon-carbon composite, S 2 -glass fibre and aluminium metal matrix composite. The transient thermal analysis of a <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> with different materials is performed and the temperature distribution on the clutch system is compared. Simulation results indicate that all {{the values of the}} temperature obtained from the analysis of aluminium metal matrix are less than those of asbestos based lining material, therefore <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> made up of aluminium metal matrix composite will assure the extended service life and the longer stability {{due to the fact that}} the temperature responsible for the wear and tear has been reduced. Furthermore, the slipping time is also considered in this investigation...|$|R
