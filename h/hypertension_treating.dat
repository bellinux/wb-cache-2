40|$|Stroke is {{a leading}} cause of {{morbidity}} andmortality, accounting for 7 % of all deaths in Canada or 2, 400 events for every million Canadians per year. 1 Patients recovering from even a mild stroke or a recent transient ischemic attack (TIA) are at high risk of stroke recurrence, physical and intellectual disability, long-term institutionaliza-tion and death. Primary and secondary stroke prevention strategies remain critical for reducing the over-all burden of atherothrombotic disease. What are the major risk factors to consider? All patients who have suffered a stroke or TIA should receive the best possible management of any risk factors present. 1. <b>Hypertension</b> <b>Treating</b> any degree of blood pressure (BP) ele-vation, including mild hypertension, has been shown to significantly reduce stroke risk. Recent evidence suggests blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with either angio-tensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may pro-vide benefits in stroke prevention beyond BP control.

40|$|Childhood {{obesity is}} a growing problem in the United States, and in North Carolina. A 2009 - 2010 survey found that 13. 4 % of {{children}} aged 2 - 17 years were obese in North Carolina and that 17. 4 % of this same age group were obese in eastern North Carolina (North Carolina State Center for Health Statistics, 2011). By contrast, 18 % percent of children aged 6 - 11 years in the United States were obese (Ogden, Carroll, Kit, & Flegal, 2012). There are many adverse health complications that may accompany childhood obesity and obesity in childhood and adolescence is associated with adult mortality (Han, Lawlor, & Kimm, 2010). An obese child {{is likely to become}} an obese adult who may face serious, long-term health problems including heart disease, diabetes and <b>hypertension.</b> <b>Treating</b> these and other obesity related conditions cost the United States about 190 billion dollars in 2005 and costs billions each year (Hilton, 2013). Childhood obesity by itself costs 14. 1 billion dollars per year in medical costs (Institute of Medicine, 2012). Many causes of childhood obesity can be identified in the child’s environment. Unhealthy food choices in numerous locations, such as, schools, neighborhood corner stores, and fast food restaurant are readily available to children.

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldOBJECTIVES: Hypertension {{has been associated with}} impaired cognition. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy were applied to assess white matter abnormalities in <b>treated</b> vs untreated <b>hypertension</b> and if these correlated with neuropsychological performance. METHODS: Subjects were 40 patients with medically <b>treated</b> <b>hypertension</b> (mean age 69. 3 years), 10 patients with untreated hypertension (mean age 57. 6 years) and 30 normotensive controls (mean age 68. 2 years). Hypertension was defined as a previous diagnosis and taking hypertensive medication, or a resting blood pressure of > 140 / 90 mmHg on the day of assessment. RESULTS: Patients with <b>treated</b> <b>hypertension</b> performed worse on immediate (P = 0. 037) as well as delayed memory tasks (P = 0. 024) compared with normotensive controls. Cognitive performance was worse in untreated compared with <b>treated</b> <b>hypertension</b> on executive functions (P = 0. 041) and psychomotor speed (P = 0. 003). There was no significant correlation between cognition and any of the imaging parameters in <b>treated</b> <b>hypertension.</b> However, in untreated hypertension the results revealed a positive correlation between an executive functioning and attention composite score and DTI mean diffusivity values (P = 0. 016) and between psychomotor speed and spectroscopy NAA/tCr levels (P = 0. 015).

40|$|Background and Purpose: The optimal {{management}} of blood pressure (BP) in acute stroke remains unclear. For ischemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis, current guidelines suggest pharmacological intervention if systolic BP exceeds 180 mm Hg. We determined retrospectively {{the association of}} BP and antihypertensive therapy with clinical outcomes after stroke thrombolysis. Methods: The SITS thrombolysis register prospectively recorded 11 080 treatments from 2002 to 2006. BP values were recorded at baseline, 2 hours, and 24 hours after thrombolysis. Outcomes were symptomatic (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score deterioration &# 8805; 4) intracerebral hemorrhage Type 2, mortality, and independence at (modified Rankin Score 0 to 2) 3 months.

40|$|Background: Observational studies {{examining}} associations between hypertension and cancer are inconsistent. We explored {{the association of}} hypertension, graded hypertension and antihypertensive treatment with cancer incidence and mortality. Method: Eighty-six thousand five hundred and ninety-three participants from the Australian and New Zealand Diabetes and Cancer Collaboration were linked to the National Death Index and Australian Cancer Database. Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) for the association of <b>treated</b> and untreated <b>hypertension</b> with cancer incidence and mortality. Results: Over a median follow-up of 15. 1 years, 12   070 incident and 4350 fatal cancers were identified. Untreated and <b>treated</b> <b>hypertension,</b> compared with normotension, were {{associated with an increased}} risk for cancer incidence [hazard ratio 1. 06, 95 % CI (1. 00 - 1. 11) and 1. 09 (1. 02 - 1. 16) respectively], and cancer mortality (1. 07, 0. 98 - 1. 18) and (1. 15, 1. 03 - 1. 28), respectively. When compared with untreated <b>hypertension,</b> <b>treated</b> <b>hypertension</b> did not have a significantly greater risk for cancer incidence (1. 03, 0. 97 - 1. 10) or mortality (1. 07, 0. 97 - 1. 19). A significant dose-response relationship was observed between graded hypertension and cancer incidence and mortality; Ptrend =  0. 053 and Ptrend =  0. 001, respectively. When stratified by treatment status, these relationships remained significant in untreated, but not in <b>treated,</b> <b>hypertension.</b> Conclusion: <b>Hypertension,</b> both <b>treated</b> and untreated, is associated with a modest increased risk for cancer incidence and mortality. Similar risks in <b>treated</b> and untreated <b>hypertension</b> suggest that the increased cancer risk is not explained by the use of antihypertensive treatment. Jessica L.

40|$|Introduction: Pharmacological {{treatment}} {{combined with}} lifestyle modifications {{is an effective}} treatment for arterial hypertension. However, there are still patients who {{do not respond to}} standard treatments. Patients with pharmacologically resistant hypertension may benefit from renal denervation (RDN). Aim: To assess long-term quality of life (QoL) after RDN and effectiveness in reduction of blood pressure (BP) in patients with resistant hypertension. Material and methods: From 2011 to 2014, 12 patients with previously diagnosed resistant <b>hypertension,</b> <b>treated</b> by RDN, were included in this study. The QoL was assessed using a standardized Polish version of the Nottingham Health Profile questionnaire (NHP). Results : The median age was 54 (IQR: 51 – 57. 5) years. Mean baseline ambulatory pre-procedural systolic/diastolic BP was 188 / 115 ± 29. 7 / 18 mm Hg. The mean values of systolic/diastolic BP measured perioperatively and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively were 138 / 86, 138 / 85, 146 / 82, 152 / 86, and 157 / 91. All p-values for mean systolic and diastolic BP before versus successive time points after RDN were statistically significant; p-value for all comparisons < 0. 05. Improvement of QoL was only observed in two sections of the NHP questionnaire: emotional reaction and sleep disturbance. The analysis of the NHP index of Distress (NHP-D) showed a lower distress level perioperatively and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after RDN as compared to baseline. The RDN was not associated with any significant adverse events. Conclusions : Patients with pharmacologically resistant <b>hypertension</b> <b>treated</b> with RDN achieved significant reduction in BP during 24 -month follow-up.
