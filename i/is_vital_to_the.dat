While it is {{generally}} ignored during infantry-limited gameplay, it <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> long-range use of the Crusader tanks {{and one of the}} missions in which the player must direct artillery fire to defend a town. It is also important for scouting, though most of the game takes place in personal, close combat situations reducing the importance of this tactic.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is an {{essential}} element needed in large quantities. The Ca2+ ion acts as an electrolyte and <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> health of the muscular, circulatory, and digestive systems; is indispensable to the building of bone; and supports synthesis and function of blood cells. For example, it regulates the contraction of muscles, nerve conduction, and the clotting of blood. As a result, intra- and extracellular calcium levels are tightly regulated by the body. Calcium can play this role because the Ca2+ ion forms stable coordination complexes with many organic compounds, especially proteins; it also forms compounds {{with a wide range}} of solubilities, enabling the formation of skeletons.|$|E

5|$|During {{the casino}} {{shutdown}}, 36,000 casino workers were given leave. The shutdown of casinos resulted in lost {{revenue for the}} state, as an estimated $1.3 million per day was collected in gambling taxes plus an additional $2 million per day due to {{the closure of the}} lottery system. However, the sum of revenue not collected during the shutdown from gambling amounted to just {{a small fraction of the}} state's annual budget. Atlantic City's 12 casinos suffered losses estimated at $16–20 million per day during the shutdown. Revenue losses to lottery vendors and casino employees have not been calculated. Legislation signed by Governor Corzine in June 2008 would keep casinos and racetracks open in the event of a future budget showdown, with the Governor noting that the casino industry <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> New Jersey economy and that it should not operate under the threat of closure as it did in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{administered}} by Kuala Terengganu City Council, which covers the whole area of Kuala Terengganu district. The district's location at the estuary of Terengganu River divided the district into two parts, Kuala Terengganu Utara (North Kuala Terengganu), now known as Kuala Nerus, and Kuala Terengganu Selatan (South Kuala Terengganu), which {{is considered to be}} Kuala Terengganu proper. As the capital, the city <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> political and economic welfare of the state. It is the centre for the state and federal government agencies administration buildings, housing the offices of many ministries' departments and governmental bodies, such as the Immigration and Customs Department, State Economic Planning Unit, Pos Malaysia Kuala Terengganu General Post Office, Terengganu State Library, and many others. As the administrative capital of Terengganu, the Legislative Assembly convenes at Wisma Darul Iman, the state secretariat building. Kuala Terengganu is also the royal capital of the state, being the site of the Sultan's many palaces, for example Istana Badariah and Istana Maziah.|$|E

25|$|X and Y {{depend upon}} the {{gramicidin}} molecule. There exist valine and isoleucine variants of all three gramicidin species, and 'X' can be either. Y determines which is which; as Y gramicidin A contains tryptophan, B phenylalanine, and C tyrosine. Also note the alternating stereochemical configurations (in the form of D and L) of the amino acids; this <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> formation of the β-helix.|$|E

It is also important for freight handling and for tourism, as cruise ships stop in Akureyri during the summer months. The ice-free nature of the port has been important in the town's establishment.|$|E

25|$|Once {{political}} {{boundaries and}} military {{lines have been}} breached, pacification of the region is the final, and arguably the most important, goal of the invading force. After {{the defeat of the}} regular military, or when one is lacking, continued opposition to an invasion often comes from civilian or paramilitary resistance movements. Complete pacification of an occupied country can be difficult, and usually impossible, but popular support <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> success of any invasion.|$|E
25|$|Biotic pollen vectors are animals, usually insects, {{but also}} reptiles, birds, mammals, and sundry others, that {{routinely}} transport pollen {{and play a}} role in pollination.

The pollen adheres to the vector's body parts such as face, legs, mouthparts, hair, feathers, and moist spots; depending on the particular vector. Such transport <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pollination of many plant species.|$|E

External quantum efficiency values of 20% and 19% have been reported for red (625nbsp&nm) and green (530nbsp&nm) diodes, respectively. However, blue diodes (430nbsp&nm) have only been able to achieve maximum external quantum efficiencies in the range of 4% to 6%.|$|E

25|$|Although {{prayer in}} its literal sense {{is not used}} in animism, {{communication}} with the spirit world <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> animist way of life.

Other ways to receive messages from the spirits include using astrology or contemplating fortune tellers and healers. The native religions {{in some parts of}} North, East and South Asia, America, Africa, and Oceania are often animistic.|$|E
25|$|Florida {{also has}} major {{environmental}} {{issues related to}} the flow in the ACF basin. The Apalachicola Bay provides 35 percent of the freshwater flow to the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and it <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> richly productive estuaries in this region. The key to the estuary is the fluctuation in salinity levels produced by the ACF's freshwater flow. A reduced flow of fresh water into these estuaries would result in higher salinity levels, that could endanger the marine life, including that supporting major seafood industries.|$|E
25|$|Copper is an {{essential}} trace element that <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> health of all living things (humans, plants, animals, and microorganisms). In humans, copper {{is essential to the}} proper functioning of organs and metabolic processes. The human body has complex homeostatic mechanisms which attempt to ensure a constant supply of available copper, while eliminating excess copper whenever this occurs. However, like all essential elements and nutrients, {{too much or too little}} nutritional ingestion of copper can result in a corresponding condition of copper excess or deficiency in the body, each of which has its own unique set of adverse health effects.|$|E

Benghazi is also an industrial and commercial centre in Libya. Major manufactured goods include processed food, textiles, tanning, processed salt and construction materials, particularly cement; a large cement factory is located in al-Hawari. Food processing is based on local fish, imported goods, and the produce of irrigated coastal lowlands and the nearby Jabal al-Akdhar Mountains, including cereal, dates, olives, wool and meat.|$|E
25|$|The Tasian {{culture was}} the next in Upper Egypt. This culture group is named for the burials found at Der Tasa, on the east bank of the Nile between Asyut and Akhmim. The Tasian culture group is notable for {{producing}} the earliest blacktop-ware, a type of red and brown pottery that is painted black {{on the top and}} interior. This pottery <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dating of Predynastic Egypt. Because all dates for the Predynastic period are tenuous at best, WMF Petrie developed a system called Sequence Dating by which the relative date, if not the absolute date, of any given Predynastic site can be ascertained by examining its pottery.|$|E
