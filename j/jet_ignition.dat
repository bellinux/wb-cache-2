40|$|A prior {{paper has}} {{presented}} a novel {{design of a}} heavy duty truck engine fuelled with H 2. In this design, the customary in-cylinder Diesel injector and glow plug are replaced with a main chamber fuel injector and a <b>jet</b> <b>ignition</b> pre-chamber. The <b>jet</b> <b>ignition</b> pre-chamber is a small volume that {{is connected to the}} in-cylinder through calibrated orifices accommodating another fuel injector and a glow or a spark plug that controls the start of combustion. This design permits to operate the engine in four different modes: traditional compression ignition (CI), diffusion, Diesel-like (M 1); mixed gasoline/Diesel-like (M 2); traditional spark ignition (SI), premixed, gasoline-like (M 3); premixed, homogeneous charge compression ignition HCCI-like (M 4). In the mode diffusion with <b>jet</b> <b>ignition</b> (M 1), an injection occurs in the <b>jet</b> <b>ignition</b> pre-chamber before the main chamber fuel is injected and the engine operates therefore mostly Diesel-like. In the mode mixed diffusion/premixed Diesel/gasoline-like (M 2) an injection occurs in the <b>jet</b> <b>ignition</b> pre-chamber after only part of the main chamber fuel is injected and mixed with air.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{incentives}} {{to increase the}} fuel efficiency of combustion processes. This paper looks at two available options to achieve this goal. The former aims to develop an experimental method that can analyze combustion at extremely high pressures to improve the understanding of high pressure H 2 /air combustion. Experimental data has been lacking a suitable combustion diagnostic to visualize high pressure combustion processes, {{making it difficult to}} improve the process. Improvement of x-ray diffraction tomography in a windowless combustor makes it possible to see flame propagation at high pressure. The procedure and chamber are still in the design phase, yet the preliminary research of beryllium windows and x-ray absorbance spectra indicate the feasibility and efficacy of this method. A technique of increasing the fuel efficiency in spark ignited engines is to use a supersonic jet from the spark chamber as the catalyst for combustion to trigger multiple ignition points in the main chamber for H 2 /air. This method requires a dual combustion chamber configuration with the pre-chamber containing the spark and various nozzle configurations to alter the structure of a supersonic jet. The pre-chamber is kept at a higher equivalence ratio, or more fuel, while the main chamber is filled with ultra-lean (phi 0. 2 to 0. 5) fuel/air. <b>Ignition</b> location, <b>jet</b> characteristics, <b>ignition</b> delay time and instability modes are studied.

The main problems with two-stroke engines are emissions and low fuel-efficiency. This research used a two-stroke engine with crankcase scavenging. It also adopted an exhaust reed valve and lamellar intake, accommodating a high pressure direct injector as used in the latest two-stroke gasoline engines. The <b>jet</b> <b>ignition</b> device is replacing traditional spark plug. The main chamber and <b>jet</b> <b>ignition</b> use hydrogen as fuel.

40|$|Hot-jet {{ignition}} of a combustible mixture has {{application in}} internal combustion engines, detonation initiation, and wave rotor combustion. Numerical predictions {{are made for}} igni-tion of combustible mixtures using a traversing jet of chemically active gas {{at one end of}} a long constant-volume combustor (CVC) with an aspect ratio similar to a wave rotor chan-nel. The CVC initially contains a stoichiometric mixture of ethylene or methane at atmos-pheric conditions. The traversing jet issues from a rotating prechamber that generates gaseous combustion products, assumed at chemical equilibrium for estimating major spe-cies. Turbulent combustion uses a hybrid eddy-breakup model with detailed finite-rate kinetics and a two-equation k-x model. The confined jet is observed to behave initially as a wall jet and later as a wall-impinging jet. The jet evolution, vortex structure, and mixing behavior are significantly different for traversing jets, stationary centered jets, and near-wall jets. Pressure waves in the CVC chamber affect ignition through flame vorticity gener-ation and compression.

40|$|To {{obtain a}} further {{insight into the}} complex flame {{acceleration}} process of deflagrating fuel/air mixtures experimental investigations were carried out in free and partially confined homogeneous clouds with hydrogen as a fuel. The results of the experiments in an unconfined hemispherical configuration shows a distinct dependence of the flame velocity on the cloud size which does not exceed, however, an upper limiting value. The experiments under partially confined conditions without additional turbulence indicate that the flame velocity and consequently the pressure field is governed by the hemispherical flame front initially formed; i. e. the flame velocity is not affected by the partial confinement. To increase the turbulence effects further experiments were carried out with a fan and with <b>jet</b> <b>ignition.</b> In the case of fan induced turbulence the flame velocity was strongly influenced by the fan speed.

40|$|Accurate {{modeling}} of turbulence/chemistry interactions in turbulent reacting diesel jets {{is critical to}} the development of predictive computational tools for diesel engines. The models should be able to predict the transient physical and chemical processes in the <b>jets</b> such as <b>ignition</b> and flame lift-off. In {{the first part of this}} work, an existing unsteady flamelet progress variable (UFPV) model is employed in Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations and large-eddy simulations (LES) to assess its accuracy. The RANS simulations predict that ignition occurs toward the leading tip of the <b>jet,</b> followed by <b>ignition</b> front propagation toward the stoichiometric surface, and flame propagation upstream along the stoichiometric surface until the flame stabilizes at the lift-off height. The LES, on the other hand, predicts ignition at multiple points in the jet, followed by flame development from the ignition kernels, merger of the different flames and then stabilization. The UFPV model assumes that combustion occurs in thin zones known as flamelets and turbulent strain characterized by the scalar dissipation rate modifies the flame structure. Since the flamelet is thinner than the smallest grid size employed in RANS or LES, the effect of the turbulence is modeled through probability distribution functions of the independent variables. The accuracy of the assumptions of the model is assessed in this work through direct numerical simulations (DNS) which resolves the flame. The DNS is carried out in turbulent mixing layers since the combustion in a diesel jet occurs in the fuel/air mixing layer surrounding the jet. ^ The DNS results show that the flamelet model is applicable but that its implementation in the UFPV model is flawed because the effects of expansion due to heat release and increase in diffusivity due to rise in temperature are not accounted for in the formulation of the scalar dissipation rate. A new diffusivity-corrected flamelet model is proposed which leads to an improved prediction of flame development. Furthermore, it is shown that the most commonly used approach to calculate the scalar dissipation rate in LES of reacting flows leads to large errors when the LES grid size is large. The DNS results are used to determine the best model for the filtered scalar dissipation rate and its PDF under diesel engine conditions. A new model is derived for the variance of the scalar dissipation rate. The DNS results are also used to compare the performance of the UFPV model with the Perfectly Stirred Reactor (PSR) model predictions. It is shown that the UFPV model performance is superior for turbulent intensities and grid sizes encountered in diesel engine application...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Ignition of a {{combustible}} mixture by {{a transient}} jet of hot reactive gas {{is important for}} safety of mines, pre-chamber ignition in IC engines, detonation initiation, and in novel constant-volume combustors. The present work is a numerical study of the hot-jet ignition process in a long constant-volume combustor (CVC) that represents a wave-rotor channel. The mixing of hot jet with cold mixture in the main chamber is first studied using non-reacting simulations. The stationary and traversing hot jets of combustion products from a pre-chamber is injected through a converging nozzle into the main CVC chamber containing a premixed fuel-air mixture. Combustion in a two-dimensional analogue of the CVC chamber is modeled using global reaction mechanisms, skeletal mechanisms, and detailed reaction mechanisms for four hydrocarbon fuels: methane, propane, ethylene, and hydrogen. The <b>jet</b> and <b>ignition</b> behavior are compared with high-speed video images from a prior experiment. Hybrid turbulent-kinetic schemes using some skeletal reaction mechanisms and detailed mechanisms are good predictors of the experimental data. Shock-flame interaction is seen to significantly increase the overall reaction rate due to baroclinic vorticity generation, flame area increase, stirring of non-uniform density regions, the resulting mixing, and shock compression. The less easily ignitable methane mixture is found to show higher ignition delay time compared to slower initial reaction and greater dependence on shock interaction than propane and ethylene. The confined jet is observed to behave initially as a wall jet and later as a wall-impinging jet. The jet evolution, vortex structure and mixing behavior are significantly different for traversing jets, stationary centered jets, and near-wall jets. Production of unstable intermediate species like C 2 H 4 and CH 3 appears to depend significantly on the initial jet location while relatively stable species like OH are less sensitive.

Our statistical analysis, relating the occurrence of both on-ground and in-flight HCWT explosions to the cumulative flight hours of commercial passenger aircraft containing HCWT's reveals that the best estimate of HCWT explosion rate is 1 explosion in 1. 4 x 10 {sup 8 } flight hours. Based on an analysis of SFAR 88 by Sandia National Laboratories and our independent analysis, SFAR 88 reduces current risk of historical HCWT explosion by at least a factor of 10, thus meeting an FAA risk criteria of 1 accident in billion flight hours. This paper also surveys and analyzes parameters for <b>Jet</b> A fuel <b>ignition</b> in HCWT's. Because of the paucity of in-flight HCWT explosions, we conclude that the intersection of the parameters necessary and sufficient to result in an HCWT explosion with sufficient overpressure to rupture the HCWT is extremely rare...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{structures}} of turbulent non-reacting jets and laminar reacting jets which impinge on walls are studied. The laminar jet studies are carried out to understand the structure of laminar diffusion flames which interact with walls. ^ A study of mass entrainment rates in wall-impinging jets and comparison of the rates with those in radial and round jets show {{that the increase in}} entrained mass in the fully developed wall-impinging jet is slower than that in the fully developed round and radial jets. These results are supported by computational studies. ^ Detailed chemical kinetics are employed in the reacting jet computations. As this approach is computationally time-consuming, several methods to accelerate the chemistry calculations are explored. It is shown that parallelizing the chemical kinetics computations using the Message Passing Interface algorithm can achieve a close to linear speed-up for chemistry calculations. An in-situ adaptive tabulation method is shown to give a significant speed-up but is not suitable during the early stage of <b>jet</b> development and <b>ignition.</b> Computations of transient reacting laminar wall jets show that minor species distribution in the wall jet is affected by wall heat transfer. NO formation in the transient wall-impinging jet is reduced relative to a free jet. A significant fraction of the soot that is formed deposits on the wall as a result of thermophoresis. Wall heat transfer decreases soot formation and oxidation rates. Radiative heat transfer also reduces the soot formation and oxidation rates. ^ A wall-modified interactive flamelet model which includes the effects of wall heat transfer is developed and implemented in a multidimensional code. In this model, several flamelets representing different levels of heat loss to the wall are calculated. The averaged flame profile is interpolated between the flamelets according to the energy defect due to wall heat loss. Computations carried out in a heavy-duty Diesel engine and comparisons with measured results in the engine show that the wall-modified flamelet model is able to improve the predictions of NO emissions relative to a more widely employed local equilibrium characteristic time model. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} development of electrically-powered, lamination-based microactuators for the realization of large arrays of high impulse and short duration micro-jets with potential applications {{in the field of}} micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). Microactuators offer unique control opportunities by converting the input electrical or chemical energy stored in a propellant into useful mechanical energy. This small and precise control obtained can potentially be applied towards aerodynamic control and transdermal drug delivery applications. This thesis discusses {{the development of}} both chemical and physical microactuators and characterizes their performance with focus towards the feasibility of using them for a specific application. The development of electrically powered microactuators starts by fabricating an array of radially firing microactuators using lamination-based micro fabrication techniques that potentially enable batch fabrication at low cost. The microactuators developed in this thesis consist of three main parts: a micro chamber in which the propellant is stored; two electrode structures through which electrical energy is supplied to the propellant; and a micro nozzle through which the propellant or released gases from the propellant are expanded as a jet. The fabricated actuators are then integrated with MEMS-process-compatible propellants and optimized to produce rapid ignition of the propellant and generate a fluidic <b>jet.</b> This rapid <b>ignition</b> is achieved either by making the propellant itself conductive, thus, passing an electric current directly through the propellant; or by discharging an arc across the propellant by placing it between two closely spaced electrodes. The first concept is demonstrated with chemical microactuators for the application of projectile maneuvering and the second concept is demonstrated with physical microactuators for transdermal drug delivery application. For both the actuators, the propellant integrated microactuators are characterized for performance in terms of impulse delivered, thrust generated and duration of the jet. The experimentally achieved results are validated by comparing with results from theoretical modeling. Finally, the feasibility of using chemical microactuators for maneuvering the path of a 25 mm projectile spinning at 500 Hz is discussed and the feasibility of applying the physical microactuators for increasing skin's permeability to drug analog molecules is studied.

40|$|This paper explores through engine {{simulations}} {{the use of}} LPG and CNG gas fuels in a 1. 5 liter Spark Ignition (SI) four cylinder {{gasoline engine}} with double over head camshafts, four valves per cylinder equipped with a novel mixture preparation and ignition system comprising centrally located Direct Injection (DI) injector and <b>Jet</b> <b>Ignition</b> (JI) nozzles. With DI technology, the fuel may be introduced within the cylinder after completion of the valve events. DI of fuel reduces the embedded air displacement effects of gaseous fuels and lowers the charge temperature. DI also allows lean stratified bulk combustion with enhanced rate of combustion and reduced heat transfer to the cylinder walls creating a bulk lean stratified mixture. Bulk combustion is started by a <b>Jet</b> <b>Ignition</b> (JI) system introducing in the main chamber multiple jets of reacting gases for enhanced rate of combustion, initiating main chamber burning in multiple regions with reduced sensitivity to mixture state and composition. Coupling of JI and DI allows {{the development of a}} lean burn engine making possible operation up to main chamber overall fuel-to-air equivalence ratios reducing almost to zero and throttle-less load control by quantity of fuel injected as in the diesel engine. Results are presented in terms of maps of brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and efficiency and maximum power densities. Load variations are obtained by varying the air to fuel equivalence ratio from ?= 1 up to ?= 6. 6. Maximum power densities running ?= 1 are 80 hp/liter (60 kW/liter) with CNG and almost 90 hp/liter (67 kW/liter) with LPG. BSFCs are as low as 200 and 190 g/kWh and brake efficiencies are up to 39 and 37 % respectively with LPG and CNG running lean ?= 1. 65. Low BSFCs and high brake efficiencies are possible from 25 to 100 % of engine load...|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} {{application}} of turbulent <b>jet</b> <b>ignition</b> technique to heavy duty multi-cylinder {{natural gas engine}} for mobile application. Pre-chamber spark plugs are identified as a promising means of achieving turbulent <b>jet</b> <b>ignition</b> as they require minimal engine modification with respect to component packaging in cylinder head and the ignition system. Detailed experiments were performed with a 6 cylinder 9. 4 liter turbo-charged engine equipped with multi-point gas injection system to compare performance and emissions characteristics of operation with pre-chamber and conventional spark plug. The results indicate that ignition capability is significantly enhanced as flame development angle and combustion duration are reduced by upto 30 % compared to those with conventional spark plugs at certain operating points. Maximum possible dilution (limited by combustion stability index, Coefficient of Variation (COV) of Gross Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEPg)) with excess air and EGR were investigated experimentally at engine speed of 1500 rpm and 5, 12 and 18 bar IMEPg operating load and {{results indicate that the}} lean limit is extended by 0. 8 - 1 Lambda unit and 5 - 8 % EGR rate units. It was also observed that pre-chamber spark plugs cause charge pre-ignition at loads exceeding 10 - 12 bar IMEPg. To avoid this, the minimum amount of dilution, with excess air and then EGR, which is required to operate above 10 bar IMEPg was estimated experimentally. Finally, to compare performance and emission characteristics of operation with these two ignition techniques, the engine was tested on an ESC-like (European Stationary Cycle) 12 mode cycle. Results indicated marginal reduction in cycle averaged NOx emissions with maximum excess air dilution and about 50 % reduction with maximum EGR dilution, whereas CO and HC emissions increased. Other operating characteristics like the flame development angle, combustion duration, brake efficiency etc. are also compared for the tested operating range of the test engine...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Obstacles in {{the path}} of a flame lead to a {{significant}} increase of the turbulence in the expansion flow in front of the flame and therefore, have a strong influence on the combustion process itself. The present paper deals with the aspect of flame quenching due to the turbulence induced by one highly blocking obstacle in hydrogen-air mixtures and the resulting acceleration of the flame. In case of sensitive mixtures it is possible to obtain a transition from the deflagrative to the detonative combustion mode (DDT). Several experiments were performed in facilities of different dimension in order to investigate the physical phe-nomena for the <b>jet</b> <b>ignition</b> behind the obstacle. Non-intrusively optical measurement techniques were used to obtain information on the flow field, the turbulence intensity in the expansion flow {{directly in front of the}} flame, and the structure of the flame itself. 1...|$|E
5000|$|In 1966, General Motors {{designed}} a special [...] engine {{for the production}} Z/28 Camaro in order for it to meet the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Trans-Am Series road racing rules limiting engine displacement to [...] from 1967 to 1969. It {{was the product of}} placing the 283 cu in 3.00 in stroke crankshaft into a [...] bore 327 cu in cylinder-block. The 1967 302 used the same nodular cast-iron crankshaft as the 283, with a forged-steel crank that was also produced. This block is one of three displacements, 302/327/350, that underwent a crankshaft bearing diameter transformation for 1968 when the rod-journal size was increased from the [...] diameter small-journal to a [...] large-journal and a main-journal size that was increased from [...] to [...] The large-journal connecting rods were thicker (heavier) and used 3/8 in diameter cap-bolts to replace the small-journal's 11/32. 1968 blocks were made in 2-bolt and 4-bolt versions with the 4-bolt center-three main caps each fastened by two additional bolts which were supported by the addition of heavier crankcase main-web bulkheads. When the journal size increased to the standard large-journal size, the crankshaft for the 302 was specially built of tufftride-hardened forged 1053-steel and fitted with a high-rpm [...] diameter harmonic balancer. It had a 3/4-length semi-circular windage tray, heat-treated, magnafluxed, shot-peened forged 1038-steel 'pink' connecting rods, floating-pin in `69, forged-aluminum pistons with higher scuff-resistance and better sealing single-moly rings. Its solid-lifter cam, known as the [...] "30-30 Duntov" [...] cam named after its /0.030 in hot intake/exhaust valve-lash and Zora Arkus-Duntov (the first Duntov cam was the / 1957 grind known as the '097, which referred to the last three digits of the casting number) the [...] "Father of the Corvette", was also used in the 1964-1965 carbureted 327/365 and fuel injected 327/375 engines. It used the '202' / valve diameter high-performance 327 double-hump `461 heads, pushrod guide plates, hardened 'blue-stripe' pushrods, edge-orifice lifters to keep more valvetrain oil in the crankcase for high-rpm lubrication, and stiffer valvesprings. In 1967, a new design high-rise cast-aluminum dual-plane intake manifold with larger smoother turn runners was introduced for the Z/28 that the LT-1 350 cu in 1969 Corvette and 1970 Z/28 engines were equipped with until the Q-jet carburetor returned in 1973. Unlike the Corvette, the exhaust manifolds were the more restrictive rear outlet 'log' design to clear the Camaro chassis's front cross-member. It had a chrome oil filler tube {{in the front of the}} intake manifold next to the thermostat housing from 1967 to 1968. The first year had unique chrome valve covers with Chevrolet stamped into them without an engine displacement decal pad. In 1968, the engine had the chrome covers, but without the Chevrolet name, connected to a PCV valve and a chrome [...] drop-base open-element air cleaner assembly fitted with a crankcase breather on a [...] vacuum secondary Holley 4-Bbl carburetor. A 'divorced' exhaust crossover port heated well-choke thermostat coil was used to provide cleaner and faster engine warm-up. Its single-point distributor had an ignition point cam designed to reduce point bounce at high rpm along with a vacuum diaphragm to advance ignition timing at idle and part-throttle for economy and emissions. Pulleys for the balancer, alternator, water-pump, as well as optional power-steering, were deep-groove to retain the drive belt(s) at high rpm. In 1969, the 302 shared the finned cast-aluminum valve covers with the LT-1 350 Corvette engine. Conservatively rated at [...] (SAE gross) at 5800 rpm and [...] at 4800, actual output with its production 11:1 compression ratio was around [...] with [...] primary x 3.00 in secondary Sanderson tubular headers that came in the trunk when ordered with a 1967 Z/28, and associated carburetor main <b>jet</b> and <b>ignition</b> timing tuningneeded. In 1968, the last year for factory headers, they had [...] primaries x 3.00 in secondaries. A stock 1968 Z/28 with the close-ratio transmission, optional transistorized-ignition and 4.88 gear, fitted with little more than the factory cowl plenum cold-air hood induction and headers, was capable of running 12.9 second/ 1/4-mile times on street tires.|$|R

40|$|Hypergolic {{propellants}} {{are widely}} used by the propulsion community in various applications. A monomethylhydrazine fuel and nitrogen tetroxide-based oxidizer rep- resent {{the state of the}} art for hypergolic propellants. The health hazards associated with these propellants has prompted research into gelled formulations due to the inherent safety advantages of gels. Gelling propellants alters many of the chemical and physical properties relevant to the processes encountered in rocket engines. The effect of these altered properties must be understood and quantified before a system utilizing gelled propellants can be fielded. This study explores the rheological properties of gelled monomethylhydrazine and red fuming nitric acid as well as the ignition of liquid and gelled monomethylhydrazine and red fuming nitric acid. ^ Monomethylhydrazine has been gelled with various concentrations of hydroxypropylcellulose. A simple procedure for mixing the gel was developed and the viscosity-shear rate relationship measured with a rotational rheometer. Increasing the hydroxypropylcellulose concentration increased the viscosity of the monomethylhydrazine gels and increased the shear-thinning behavior of the gels. The viscosity- shear rate relationship was modeled using the power-law and Carreau-Yasuda models to quantify the repeatability of the rheological properties. The viscosity measurements for the monomethylhydrazine gels generally varied less than 25 % from the average for a single gel formulation. The monomethylhydrazine gels had negligible yield stresses and were not thixotropic. ^ Red fuming nitric acid was gelled with 3, 4, and 5 % by mass fumed silica using a mixing procedure developed for silica-hydrocarbon gels. The red fuming nitric acid gels exhibited shear-thinning, thixotropic behavior and had measurable yield stress values. Increasing the fumed silica concentration increased the viscosity, the shear-thinning behavior, and the yield stress of the gels. A power-law curve fit was applied to the viscosity-shear rate results and demonstrated large variations in the rheological measurements. The large deviations resulted from the thixotropic behavior the gels. A method that presheared the gel samples prior to performing the rheological measurements led to improved measurement repeatabililty. ^ The ignition of liquid monomethylhydrazine and red fuming nitric acid was examined through a series of drop tests and impinging jet tests with a unlike-doublet injection system. Drop tests resulted in minimum ignition delays of 1. 5 milliseconds characterized by a flame and a loud report. In the impinging <b>jet</b> tests an <b>ignition</b> event defined by a visible flame was observed only at injection velocities from 8 to 20 ft/s. The ignition events were characterized by poor mixing and the burning of large monomethylhydrazine drops with no flame spreading. A series of impinging jet tests with a hydrocarbon-based fuel mixture and 91. 2 % H 2 O 2 resulted in repeatable ignition delays from 6 to 8 ms at injection velocities from 48 to 138 ft/s, verifying the system functionality. Additional jet tests with a fuel mixture of 2 -dimethylaminoethylazide and tetramethylethylenediamine with red fuming nitric acid exhibited similar ignition behavior to the monomethylhydrazine and red fuming nitric acid tests. An investigation into the red fuming nitric acid composition points to the presence of some impurity that may be altering the <b>ignition</b> processes. Impinging <b>jet</b> tests were also performed with monomethylhydrazine and red fuming nitric acid gels. Although an ignition event was generally not observed, the gels exhibited distinct flow patterns related to the rheological properties of the propellants. ...|$|R
