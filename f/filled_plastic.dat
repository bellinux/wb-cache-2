50|$|Ground mica {{is used in}} the well-drilling {{industry}} as an additive to drilling fluids. The coarsely ground mica flakes help prevent the loss of circulation by sealing porous sections of the drill hole. Well drilling muds accounted for 15% of dry-ground mica use in 2008. The plastics industry used dry-ground mica as an extender and filler, especially in parts for automobiles as lightweight insulation to suppress sound and vibration. Mica is used in plastic automobile fascia and fenders as a reinforcing material, providing improved mechanical properties and increased dimensional stability, stiffness, and strength. Mica-reinforced plastics also have high-heat dimensional stability, reduced warpage, and the best surface properties of any <b>filled</b> <b>plastic</b> composite. In 2008, consumption of dry-ground mica in plastic applications accounted for 2% of the market. The rubber industry used ground mica as an inert filler and mold release compound in the manufacture of molded rubber products such as tires and roofing. The platy texture acts as an antiblocking, antisticking agent. Rubber mold lubricant accounted for 1.5% of the dry-ground mica used in 2008. As a rubber additive, mica reduces gas permeation and improves resiliency.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} bamboo and hybrid bamboo-precipitated calcium {{carbonate}} (PCC) fillers on thermal expansion behavior of <b>filled</b> <b>plastic</b> composites was investigated. The linear {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (LCTE) of the filled composites decreased with increased PCC and bamboo filler loading levels. The composite system with refined bamboo fibers (RBFs) had smaller LCTE values {{compared with those}} from the systems with ground bamboo particles (GBPs). The use of silane treatment on bamboo fiber/particle surface helped enhance its bonding to the plastic matrix, leading to a further reduction of LCTE values for both GBP and RBF composite systems. The observed behavior of reduced LCTE is attributed to a small filler LCTE value, reduced overall plastic volume, and enhanced interfacial bonding with treated bamboo materials. Thus, hybrid bamboo and PCC fillers are suitable materials for reducing the thermal expansion of the composites caused by temperature changes...|$|E
40|$|The {{applicability}} {{and limits}} of time-resolved transillumination to determine the internal details of biological tissues are investigated by phantom experiments. By means of line scans across a sharp edge, the spatial resolution (Ax) and its dependence on the time-gate width (At) can be determined. Additionally, measurements of completely absorbing bead pairs embedded in a turbid medium demon-strate the physical resolution in a more realistic case. The benefit of time resolution is especially high for a turbid medium with a comparatively small reduced scattering coefficient of approximately pL, ' = 0. 12 mm- 1. Investigations with partially absorbing beads and <b>filled</b> <b>plastic</b> tubes demonstrate the high sensitivity of time-resolving techniques with respect to spatial variations in scattering or absorption coefficients that are due to the embedded disturber.

40|$|A {{piezoelectric}} acoustic {{position detector}} has been fabricated using a piezoelectric bimorph ring and an acoustic sensor. The disk type piezoelectric bimorph with a center-opening and the acoustic sensor are placed {{at each end}} of a small plastic cylindrical cavity and act as the driving element and the detecting element, respectively. When the driving element vibrates at the cavity's resonance frequency, the air <b>filled</b> <b>plastic</b> cavity will be excited into a resonance state. The resonance frequency can be estimated by using a Helmholtz resonator theory. When an object obstructs the sound beam, the acoustic field would be changed. This thus leads to a variation {{in the state of the}} sound resonance. A lock-in amplifier is used to monitor the output voltage and phase change of the acoustic sensor. The experimental results show that the position detector has a linear phase change of 0. 017 ° μm- 1 and a linear voltage change of 51. 2 μV/μm to small displacement along the acoustic radiation direction.

40|$|Abstract: Slush {{nitrogen}} (SN 2) is {{a mixture}} of solid nitrogen and liquid nitrogen coexisting under an average temperature of - 207 ºC. In order to investigate whether plunging a French plastic straw (commonly used for spermatozoa cryopreservation) in SN 2 may substantially increase cooling rates with respect to liquid nitrogen (LN 2), a numerical simulation of the heat conduction equation with convective boundary condition was used to predict the cooling rates. Calculations performed using heat transfer coefficients in the range of film boiling confirmed the main benefit of plunging a straw in slush over LN 2 does not arise from their temperature difference (- 207 ºC vs. - 196 ºC) but from an increase in the external heat transfer coefficient. Numerical simulations using high heat transfer (h) coefficients (assumed to prevail in SN 2) suggested that plunging in SN 2 would increase cooling rates of French straw. This increase of cooling rates was attributed to a less or null film boiling responsible for the low heat transfer coefficients in liquid nitrogen when the straw is placed in the solidliquid mixture or slush. In addition, it was demonstrated that predicted cooling rates of French straws in SN 2 tends to level-off for high h values, suggesting heat transfer is dictated by the heat conduction within the liquid <b>filled</b> <b>plastic</b> stra...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} 3 {{different}} methods for removing the initial {{air on the}} properties of fermented plant beverages produced from phom-nang seaweed (Gracilaria fisheri) and wild forest noni (Morinda coreia Ham.) were investigated. Only method M which covered the space above the fermentation liquid with a water <b>filled</b> <b>plastic</b> bag produced no surface film of yeast, had the highest acidity and also antibacterial activity from both plants after 90 days of fermentation. However, the yeast count still exceeded the standard guidelines for plant beverages. The fermented beverage from wild forest noni showed more antibacterial activity against 3 of 4 pathogenic bacteria tested than that from the phomnang seaweed, probably for its higher levels of acidity and ethanol content. Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) isolated from the fermentation samples from days 1 - 5 using the method M from both fermented plant beverages were Leuconostoc mesenteroides supsp. mesenteroides and Leu. mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum while presence of Lactobacilus plantarum was only recorded at days 4 - 5 in the wild forest noni beverage. From days 6 - 14 the isolates were Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus brevis from wild forest noni beverage, whereas only L. brevis was not detected in the seaweed beverage. During days 21 - 45 both beverages had a similar LAB population of L. plantarum and L. brevis while L. coryniformis was only found in the wild forest noni beverage.

40|$|Many {{engineering}} structures completely surround and enclose gas filled volumes. The enclosed gas adds additional stiffness {{to the surrounding}} structure. This thesis shows how to account for this effect {{by means of an}} augmented virtual work principle. The additional term augmenting the virtual work equilibrium statement for the structure is the virtual boundary work done by the pressure of the enclosed gas. The augmented equations are discretized using standard finite element methods, and the additional terms are discussed. The resulting 2 ̆ 2 pneumatic 2 ̆ 2 finite element is shown to be analogous to regular structural finite elements. To assess the accuracy and efficiency and also to illustrate the applicability of the present formulation, a series of seven examples was selected. The first three examples demonstrate the behavior of a simple pneumatic cylinder. In two of these examples, the cylinder is attached to a compressed beam-column. In the next two examples, the behavior of the end cap of a partially <b>filled</b> <b>plastic</b> food product container is studied. The numerical results using the pneumatic element compare well with an alternative Rayleigh-Ritz solution of the end cap behavior. The final two examples represent the behavior of a double bellows air spring shock absorber under static isothermal and dynamic adiabatic conditions. For the static isothermal case, an experimental study was performed with results in good agreement with the pneumatic element solutions. For the dynamic adiabatic loading case, the dynamic stiffness of the air spring was predicted using the pneumatic element. The numerical results agree with experimental data published in an air spring application guide. The examples illustrate that the pneumatic element formulation {{can be applied to the}} large deflection analysis of structures that enclose gas filled volumes. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of the lung weight in vivo is possible with the quantitative computer tomography (qCT) analysis. Especially in acute lung injury (ALI) {{the knowledge of the}} lung weight can help to identify the etiology of lung-dysfunction. The current definition of ALI is orientating on parameters such as impaired oxygenation or radiological opacifications. With this definition a heterogeneous group is captured. There might be dysfunction of the lung due to atelectasis or due to edema, both leading to impaired oxygenation. For the clinician it is important to differentiate between atelectasis and edema. For example, in patients with edematous lungs the clinician is focusing on prevention of secondary lung injury whereas in atelectasis the clinician is targeting a more aggressive treatment. The method of qCT has the potential to differentiate atelectasis from edema and could thus provide valuable information for managing trauma patients fulfilling commonly used criteria for ALI. So far a reference value for normal lung weights in ventilated patients is not available. In recent studies the lung weights of ALI-Patients where compared to healthy spontaneous breathing patients. Effects of a positive end expiratory pressure ventilation (PEEP) or possible influence of intravenous fluid substitution were ignored. The aim of this work was define a reference value of normal lung-weights in ventilated trauma patients. To reveal possible effects of PEEP or intravenous fluid substitution on the lung weight we provided a comparison group of spontaneous breathing trauma patients. In this prospective observational study CTs of trauma patients with normal lungs who underwent emergency CT were selected and two subgroups formed for spontaneous breathing (n = 31) and mechanically ventilated patients (n = 44). The decision whether a lung was normal was based on independent reviewers of the CT images. The arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2) had to be greater than 400 mmHg. Demographic data, ventilation and clinical parameters of each patient where obtained from the patient data management system. In demographic data mechanically ventilated patients did not differ from the spontaneous breathing patients (only significant variation in sex, with a higher male proportion in the ventilated group). Mechanically ventilated patients were ventilated with PEEP of 10 mmHg {{at the time of the}} CT acquisition. The PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was 550  74 mmHg. Mechanically ventilated patients received significant more intravenous fluid substitution (p = 0. 02). The lung weight in mechanically ventilated patients was 873  124 g Standard deviation (SD), in spontaneous breathing patients 866  169 g SD. The validity of our method was reviewed by placing a water <b>filled</b> <b>plastic</b> bottle next to the thorax. The mass was calculated in two ways: by quantitative computed tomography and by the volumetric mass density of water. A deviation of 2 % could be shown Our results suggest that lung weights of mechanically ventilated patients with normal lungs do not differ from those of other with normal lungs (Gattinoni 2006, Puybasset 2000). In conclusion, a moderate PEEP neither a moderate intravenous fluid substitution do not affect the lung weight. The lung weights assessed in this work can be used as reference values, especially, for the group of the trauma-associated ALI. With these results it is possible to identify pathological lung weights. Furthermore it gives a tool in identifying the etiology of ALI and therefore it helps the clinician in making the right therapeutic decisions...|$|E
