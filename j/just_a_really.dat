5|$|There's {{something}} special about that first single, we were never quite able to recapture that sound. I don't {{know if it was}} the guitars or the recording. It was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> gnarly, gnarly guitar sound. We've gotten some since, but they've been a different kind. I think it {{had more to do with}} the actual electromagnetic chemistry of what was going through our amps that day. It was just a cool, fried-out sound.|$|E

She had previously covered the Isley Brothers' single [...] "At Your Best (You Are Love)". By 2001, Aaliyah had enjoyed her now seven-year career and {{felt a sense of}} accomplishment. [...] "This is what I always wanted," [...] she said of her career in Vibe magazine. [...] "I breathe to perform, to entertain, I can't imagine myself doing anything else. I'm <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> happy girl right now. I honestly love every aspect of this business. I really do. I feel very fulfilled and complete." ...|$|E
500|$|According to his colleagues, Hillenburg is [...] "a perfectionist workaholic". He is {{also known}} for his private nature. Julia Pistor, co-producer of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, noted that Hillenburg is [...] "very shy". She went on to say, [...] "He doesn't {{want people to know}} about his life or family. He's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> funny, down-to-earth guy with a dry sense of humor who puts his family first and keeps us on our toes in keeping our {{corporate}} integrity." [...] Hillenburg said about himself, [...] "I make animation because I like to draw and create things. I have no real interest to be on camera or to be a celebrity. It's not that I don't like people, but I like having my privacy." ...|$|E

"I think it's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> metaphor, <b>really.</b> It's <b>a</b> {{psychiatric}} {{term for}} when crazy people {{get together and}} their out-of-control psyches enhance one another, and not always in positive ways. I think it describes the inner-workings of Fall Out Boy. When {{the four of us}} get together in a room, things get pretty insane." [...] —Joe Trohman, on the significance of the album's title.|$|R
500|$|Vernon was sampled {{on another}} {{song from the}} album, [...] "Lost in the World" [...] and appears on vocals on [...] "Monster". While there during {{recording}} sessions, he had reportedly recorded 10 tracks. He watched Minaj record her verse, and he too, expressed admiration for Minaj's performance on the song, however he noted that initially {{he had no idea}} who she was. Vernon described the process as highly artistic, stating that the fourteen-hour day recording schedule allowed for a lot of fun and creativity. West, talking about recording the song with Vernon, stated that he was [...] "similar to me, where he just does shit just so people would be like, 'Oh shit, how did you do that? How did that happen?' He's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> cool guy to be around." ...|$|E
500|$|Lehto {{recalled}} that making a character-driven story {{was a great}} challenge—players would come {{to know more about}} them as they progressed through the campaign, but the Spartan characters also had to behave intelligently. [...] "The Halo games consistently featured protagonists that were silent during gameplay sequences. Community manager Brian Jarrard pushed for allowing players to choose a female Noble Six and have the cinematics and dialogue change accordingly. The post-credit game sequence was the subject of intense discussion; some at Bungie wanted to remove it. Executive producer Joe Tung noted, [...] "the 'survive' component ... felt great to us. We definitely talked about different versions of how that was happening and different versions of ending [...] cinematically, but I think the way that it ultimately ended up is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> well-paced, significant and emotionally impactful ending." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1982, {{freelance}} reporter Randy Shilts {{completed his}} first book: {{a biography of}} Milk, titled The Mayor of Castro Street. Shilts wrote the book while {{unable to find a}} steady job as an openly gay reporter. The Times of Harvey Milk, a documentary film based on the book's material, won the 1984 Academy Award for Documentary Feature. Director Rob Epstein spoke later about why he chose the subject of Milk's life: [...] "At the time, {{for those of us who}} lived in San Francisco, it felt like it was life changing, that all the eyes of the world were upon us, but in fact most of the world outside of San Francisco had no idea. It was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> brief, provincial, localized current events story that the mayor and a city council member in San Francisco were killed. It didn't have much reverberation." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{scheduled}} for release in August. Schieppati claims it will be heavier than the band's 2003 release, This Is Love, This Is Murderous, and bridges the gap between This Love and The Truth, [...] "The melodies are darker, the riffs are heavier. We <b>just</b> wrote <b>a</b> <b>really</b> aggressive record that encompasses everything we've ever tried {{to do as a}} band and then raised the bar a notch or two." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, Wright named John Leslie live on air as the {{television}} presenter being {{linked to the}} alleged rape of Ulrika Jonsson. Wright subsequently claimed he couldn't remember blurting out Leslie's name during the show. In a Sky 1 show, John Leslie: My Year of Hell, Wright offered John Leslie an apology. Leslie confirmed he wouldn't sue Wright, claiming: [...] "I think he <b>just</b> made <b>a</b> <b>really</b> big mistake and unfortunately I was the one paying the price." ...|$|R
5000|$|His response: [...] "Interesting question! I {{think it}} might be the car {{accident}} syndrome, where sometimes you don't WANT to look, but you always end up turning your head to see what happens. They are so unrealistic and usually quite graphic with their violence, that it becomes almost silly, and you start to laugh and wonder how is the next person going to die. Maybe everybody <b>just</b> likes <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good villain, and I think Jason is probably in the top five." ...|$|R
500|$|Eve was {{contracted}} {{to appear in}} two episodes of Glee, having been offered the role of Grace after Whitney Houston declined to appear. Discussing her casting, Eve stated: [...] "I got asked and I'd heard the buzz about the show. When the first pilot episode came out, I figured it was something different and something we haven't seen on TV before. I didn't want to turn it down!" [...] She commented {{that she would have}} loved to have seen Whitney Houston appear in the show, explaining: [...] "I think it would've been different in a sense because she's an original diva. She would've brought a whole other energy, which would've been amazing." [...] Comparing her character Grace to McKinley High glee director Will, Eve explained: [...] "For me especially, I come from a harder place. I'm the teacher of a reform school. I'm used to being very strict." [...] Asked if she would return to the show in the future, she replied: [...] "If I'm asked to do it, I definitely would. It's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> well-made, smart show." [...] Though she does not sing in [...] "Hairography", Eve commented that she would like to do so if she returned to Glee in the future, naming [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] by Eurythmics as her ideal song choice.|$|E
500|$|In April 2004, Clarkson {{entered the}} studio {{immediately}} after the Independent Tour. She said in an interview, [...] "I've written most of (the songs) so far, but there's {{some people who have}} some stuff for me. I'm not {{one of those people who}} thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) as long as I can relate to it." [...] During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, [...] "I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material." [...] Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, [...] "I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone." [...] In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, [...] "I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing... so it worked out perfectly." [...] Moody recalled, [...] "It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she had all these songs in mind of what she wanted to do. It's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>really,</b> really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently." ...|$|E
2500|$|Azarenka {{tends to}} play an {{aggressive}} baseline style that showcases her mobility. She is known for her strong two handed backhand, return game and taking the ball early. Her game is based on controlled aggression which she uses to hit relentless groundstrokes and to move her opponent around the court in order to hit low risk winners. Her aggressive game was praised particularly by American tennis player Sloane Stephens, who said that [...] "she's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> tough competitor".|$|E

5000|$|... "It was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> joke, <b>really,</b> like {{lot of my}} {{paintings}} that poke fun at things, comments Schorr, who completed the piece in 2000, then sold it to Courteney Cox of Friends television show fame." [...] Initially, [...] "leaders of Art and Culture Center of Hollywood...had decided to take down the painting that had drawn nasty phone calls, e-mails, and criticism from the City Commission." [...] The controversy died down after meetings between local, state, and museum officials concerning artist's rights, free speech and censorship.|$|R

It's kinda disgraceful that they won't spend anything on a decent recording! I won't say who, because last time I commented on a sloppy recording (on this page), they refused to pay me and I got all manner of threats and insults from people associated with the band, so I'd best be quiet!" ...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Vice Magazine, the twins stated, [...] "Part of our heritage is German American. Also our eyes are blue, and Prussian Blue is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> pretty color." [...] They also remarked, [...] "there is also {{the discussion of the}} lack of 'Prussian Blue' coloring (Zyklon B residue) in the so-called gas chambers in the concentration camps. We think it might make people question some of the inaccuracies of the 'Holocaust' myth." [...] This is a reference to claims made by many Holocaust deniers that the Holocaust either did not happen or had far fewer victims.|$|E
2500|$|News {{reports from}} Waterloo County, Ontario {{indicate}} that [...] "A Lutheran minister was {{pulled out of}} his house ... he was dragged through the streets. German clubs were ransacked through the course of the war. It was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> nasty time period.". That sentiment was the primary reason for the 1916 Berlin to Kitchener name change in Waterloo County. A document in the Archives of Canada makes the following comment: [...] "Although ludicrous to modern eyes, the whole issue of a name for Berlin highlights the effects that fear, hatred and nationalism can have upon a society in the face of war." ...|$|E
2500|$|Craig Sheffer portrays Keith Scott, Dan's older, kinder, under-achieving brother. Sheffer {{said that}} {{characters}} like Keith {{are not the}} most enjoyable to play. [...] "Keith is a very simple character. I actually prefer more of a challenge. He wasn't a hugely interesting character. But {{he was a good}} guy and he was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> genuine human being with good intentions", commented Sheffer. [...] "And that's a nice thing to play and come {{home at the end of}} the day. You don't bring too much with you. We had some good scenes within the framework of a simple character, so there was some of that stuff to play, but also a lot of cheesy stuff." [...] After Dan chose Deb rather than Karen, Keith helped Karen to raise Lucas and fell in love with her, but they only get together in season three. He had a recurring drinking problem and rivalry with his brother.|$|E
5000|$|The opening shows Su-Elise Nash {{staring into}} a mirror, before all three girls get sucked in. Once inside they sing and perform a dance routine before a white and gold backdrop.

When the remix concludes, the video finished off as it began, with the three girls looking into the mirror, with Su-Elise proclaiming: [...] "I <b>just</b> had <b>a</b> <b>really</b> weird daydream".

2500|$|Despite {{concerns}} by Havins, fans of {{the romance}} continued to support the pairing. Havins, cautious but appreciative {{in regards to the}} couple's popularity, expressed thanks for the support. Even though the network produced an alternative coupling for Babe with Babe and Josh, which was set as a healthier love story, it had the opposite effect on viewers, who saw Josh's need and [...] "love" [...] for Babe as an obsession reminiscent of a stalker. Coleridge, on the other hand, saw Josh as a better choice for Babe and found it difficult to blame Babe for her one-night stand/emotional affair with him. Havins disagreed about the cheating, but touched on the importance of needing a change for the love story: [...] "Babe's affair was wrong. But her marriage to JR is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> volatile, unhealthy relationship at this point. Some extreme changes need to be made. It can't just be JR saying 'I'm sorry' until the next thing happens. We've heard that before." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ramsay's {{reputation}} is built upon {{his goal of}} culinary perfection. Since the airing of Boiling Point which followed Ramsay's quest of earning three Michelin stars, the chef has also become infamous for his fiery temper and use of expletives. Ramsay once famously ejected food critic A. A. Gill along with his dining companion, Joan Collins, from his restaurant, leading Gill to state that [...] "Ramsay is a wonderful chef, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> second-rate human being." [...] Ramsay admitted in his autobiography {{that he did not}} mind if Gill insulted his food, but a personal insult {{he was not going to}} stand for. Ramsay has also had confrontations with his kitchen staff, including one incident that resulted in the pastry chef calling the police. A 2005 interview reported Ramsay had retained 85% of his staff since 1993. Ramsay attributes his management style to the influence of previous mentors, notably chefs Marco Pierre White and Guy Savoy, father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, and Jock Wallace, his manager while a footballer at Rangers.|$|E

We've started work— I've {{done a lot of}} visuals and Damon's done a lot of music but we haven't figured out how they're going to fit together. I can't say much about it yet but it's sort of like a film, but not with one narrative story. There's many stories, told around a bigger story, set to music, and done in live action, animation, all different styles, well... originally it was a film but now we think it's a film and it's a stage thing as well and... look, it's basically us doing what the fuck we want without worrying about whether it's for a record company or a film company or whatever. So I'm not sure how it'll pan out, or even if it will happen. But Damon's written around 70 songs for it, and I've got great plans for the visuals, but right now, at this moment, it's still <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good idea."

5000|$|When EastEnders {{embarked}} upon a storyline {{which saw}} Lucy's peer Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) abused by the ephebophile Tony King (Chris Coghill), the Daily Mirrors Tony Stewart questioned whether viewers {{would take the}} plot seriously, given the [...] "sexually precocious" [...] nature of the soap's storylines, {{and the fact that}} only recently, Lucy, who is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> year younger than Whitney, had almost given her virginity to her older boyfriend. When Tony began to groom Lucy's friend Lauren, the Mirrors Maeve Quigley commented: [...] "It's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> pity <b>really</b> that Tony didn't decide to turn his attentions to Lucy Beale instead - he would be minus a vital piece of his anatomy and his wallet by now." ...|$|R

The title itself [...] "Cloud Atlas," [...] the cloud refers to the ever changing manifestations of the Atlas, which is the fixed human nature which is always thus and ever shall be. So the book's theme is predacity, the way individuals prey on individuals, groups on groups, nations on nations, tribes on tribes. So I just take this theme {{and in a sense}} reincarnate that theme in another context...|$|R
5000|$|Ball {{said of the}} finale, [...] "...the {{first part}} of the season {{we had a lot of}} {{different}} storylines taking place in different places and then we wanted to bring them all together ... where everyone was fighting the same fight for the last episode." [...] He also commented on the scene in which Jessica feeds on a truck driver, [...] "She's still a fairly freshly-made vampire. Bill hasn't been much of a maker and she <b>just</b> had <b>a</b> <b>really</b> emotional experience with Hoyt walking out on her.
