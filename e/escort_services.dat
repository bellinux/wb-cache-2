25|$|It {{is known}} that Li Luoneng was {{proficient}} in other martial arts before studying Dai clan's Xin Yi. Some claim his original art was Qimen Quan (奇门拳), perhaps his family's style, while others believe he actually studied Tongbei Quan and Gongli Quan. Li came to study under the Dai family either because he heard of their fame in the martial arts and business, or maybe as suggested by others, after having fought and lost to a practitioner of their art. It is generally agreed he then settled {{in the area of}} their village, and grew and sold vegetables, which earned him the nickname 'Li Lao Nong' 李老农 (Old Farmer Li, but also 'Respectable Farmer Li'). Initially, members of the Dai clan refused to teach him, but he eventually won over their trust, and he was taught by Dai Wenxiong, Guo Weihan, or both. After learning Dai Xin Yi for a number of years, perhaps over a decade, Li left the Dai territories and traveled across Shanxi and Hebei provinces, teaching for many years his own elaboration on the art, now called 'Xing Yi Quan'. No reasons were ever recorded for the many changes Li made to the art, but there are those who claim that Li wished to compete with the Dai clan's fame, perhaps because of some grudge. Li and many of his students and grand-students were famous for offering bodyguard and caravan <b>escort</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E

40|$|A QUALITATIVE STUDY ON THE EXPERIENCE OF <b>ESCORT</b> <b>SERVICE</b> UNDER THE ACT (SFS 1993 : 387) SUPPORT AND SERVICE FOR THE DISABLED The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{experiences}} of <b>escort</b> <b>service</b> under the Act (SFS 1993 : 387) concerning Support and Service for the disabled (LSS) for self-determination, participation and equality of living conditions. In the results of this study appears that the <b>escort</b> <b>service</b> fulfills its role in breaking the isolation of persons with disabilities.

The aspects that emerges is that <b>escort</b> <b>service</b> gives persons with disabilities the opportunity to develop their independence, increase their self-esteem and broaden their frames of reference through increased participation in community life.
