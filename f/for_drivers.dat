Schumacher would be world champion if he finished ahead of Villeneuve, or if Villeneuve failed to score any points by finishing lower than sixth or not completing the race.|$|E
5|$|After quickly {{growing into}} a city, Omaha failed to pave its streets accordingly. A chaotic {{transportation}} system was highlighted by several miles of successful horsecar tracks; however, the city only ever had four miles (6km) of cable car service. Several early suburbs were built on reliance of service from these lines, including Dundee, Benson and Kountze Place. In the early 1880s an extensive boulevard system {{was built to}} create a park-like atmosphere <b>for</b> <b>drivers</b> throughout the city. The Trans-Mississippi Exposition in 1889 led {{to the construction of}} many new transportation features, particularly the magnificent Burlington Station.|$|E

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the final positions, Loeb started the season leading in the World Rally Championship <b>for</b> <b>Drivers</b> with ten points. Sordo was second with eight points, Grönholm was in third position with six points. In the World Rally Championship for Manufacturers, Stobart Ford had one point from Henning Solberg's fourteenth-placed position (although Wilson finished the rally quicker, he was not nominated to earn points for the manufacturer). Stohl earned OMV-Kronos Citroën two points. Subaru were in third place with eight points, BP-Ford were two points clear of Subaru in second place, and Citroën Total WRT was first, with eighteen points – ten from Loeb's win and eight from Sordo.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invocation}} {{and the performance}} of the United States National Anthem, the children of the late sports marketer Ed Shull gave the command <b>for</b> <b>drivers</b> to start their engines. On the pace laps, Johnson, after changing his engine, and teammate Earnhardt, who had to move to a back-up car, had to fall behind all the other drivers in the event after doing major changes during practice. At the start, Newman was the leader going through the first corner, but on the same lap Menard, with pushing assistance from Martin, passed him. On the second lap, the first caution was given because Newman spun sideways in the second turn but avoided impacting the wall. During the caution, he drove to pit road for a pit stop.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{politicians}} on {{both sides}} of the river began to seek funding to build a new road bridge across the river. The rail bridge, while still adequate for rail traffic, it proved to be a challenge <b>for</b> <b>drivers.</b> The western terminus of the bridge featured a curve which was navigated easily by wagons and early automobiles, but was dangerous for semi trucks. Governor Terry Branstad was convinced a new bridge was needed after riding in a railcar to view the underside of the road deck. The new, four-lane Keokuk–Hamilton bridge opened on November 23, 1985, nearly eight months ahead of schedule and under budget.|$|E

5|$|Loeb's win was {{his fourth}} at Monte Carlo and twenty-ninth in WRC. It was the sixth {{time that he}} had {{achieved}} a podium position there, which brought his WRC podium finishes to forty-eight. He earned ten points in the World Rally Championship <b>for</b> <b>Drivers.</b> Sordo was two points behind him, while Grönholm was in third position with six points. With Atkinson and Hirvonen in fourth and fifth place, Petter Solberg, Toni Gardemeister and Jan Kopecký were the other points finishers. In the World Rally Championship for Manufacturers, Citroën Total World Rally Team earned the maximum eighteen points for their 1–2 finish, BP Ford World Rally Team placed second, with ten points, with the Subaru World Rally Team placing third with eight points.|$|E
5|$|Outside the World Rally Championship, Mouton drove a Porsche Carrera RS {{to victory}} in the 1977 RACE Rallye de España and to {{second place in the}} 1977 Tour de France Automobile. She also {{finished}} runner-up to Bernard Darniche in the overall European Rally Championship (ERC). Mouton {{went on to win the}} Tour de France with the 131 Abarth the following year. At the Rallye d'Antibes, she finished third behind the Stratos drivers Darniche and Attilio Bettega. She placed fifth in the ERC standings and fourth in the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) Cup <b>for</b> <b>Drivers,</b> the predecessor to the drivers' world championship. In 1979, Mouton finished second in the French Rally Championship, behind Porsche 911 SC driver Bernard Béguin.|$|E
5|$|The race {{began at}} 3:15p.m. Eastern Standard Time and was {{televised}} {{live in the}} United States on ABC. At {{the start of the}} race, weather conditions were cloudy. Dr. Roger Marsh began pre-race ceremonies by giving the invocation. The Texas Christian University Marching Band performed the national anthem, and rock band ZZ Top gave the command <b>for</b> <b>drivers</b> to start their engines. During the pace laps, two drivers moved {{to the back of the}} grid due to unapproved changes: Bill Elliott because of an transmission change, and Andretti because he changed his engine.|$|E

5|$|Although March {{considered}} quitting Formula One {{on several}} occasions, money was always found to support {{at least one}} car. Motorsport historian Mike Lawrence credits Mosley with pressing for a six-wheeled March to be built as a draw for sponsors, having seen the popularity with fans of Tyrrell's six-wheeled P34. The resulting March 2-4-0 never competed in Formula One, but generated the required publicity and a Scalextric slotcar model was profitable. Mosley {{spent much of his}} time negotiating deals <b>for</b> <b>drivers</b> with sponsorship and was also successful in selling Marches to other Formula One teams, such as Williams and Penske. The cars were rarely frontrunners, although the works team won a single race in both 1975 and 1976. By the end of 1977, Mosley was fed up with the struggle to compete in Formula One with no resources and left to work for FOCA full-time, selling his shares in the company to Herd but remaining as a director. March's involvement in Formula One ended the same year.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{new ideas}} about the {{treatment}} of alcoholism, the lifetime suspension was downgraded to a 10-year suspension in 1952. DUI prosecutions remained difficult in cases when drivers refused to take a Breathalyzer test, and so in 1966, the state authorized the suspension of a person's driver's license for refusing to submit a breath sample. In 1977, the BAC limit was reduced to 0.10%, but the law was modified to differentiate between {{the second and third}} offenses, with lesser penalties for first and second convictions. In 1983, the state established a per se rule wherein a person over the limit was considered drunk in all cases (that is, not merely a presumption). Nine years later, the 0.01% BAC limit <b>for</b> <b>drivers</b> under 21 was instituted, and in 2003, the 0.10% BAC limit was reduced to 0.08% to comply with federal highway funding requirements.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the first}} Gatorade Duel, Murphy Reynolds gave the command <b>for</b> <b>drivers</b> {{to start their}} engines. During the pace laps, Casey Mears went {{to the back of}} the field because he changed his engine and Truex did the same because he {{switched}} to a backup car. At the start, Gordon and Bayne were the leaders. On the first lap, Bowyer became the leader after having assistance from Burton. On the following lap, Jamie McMurray moved into the third position, after drafting with Kyle Busch. On the third lap, the first caution was given because Mears' engine failed. At the lap six restart, Bowyer was the leader, ahead of Burton, Kyle Busch, and Biffle. Two laps later, Busch became the leader. On the 11th lap, Carl Edwards moved up to third, while McMurray moved up to second. Two laps later, Edwards became the leader. On lap 14, Gordon reclaimed the first position, as Bayne moved up to second. On the following lap, the second caution was given after Logano collided into the wall and slid through grass. Most of the drivers made pit stops during the caution. At the lap 20 restart, Edwards was the leader ahead of Kyle Busch.|$|E
5|$|Kulwicki raced in fourNASCAR Busch Grand National Series (now Xfinity Series) {{races in}} 1984. At the time, the Busch Grand National Series was {{considered}} NASCAR's feeder circuit, a proving ground <b>for</b> <b>drivers</b> {{who wished to}} step up to the organization's premiere circuit, the Winston Cup. Kulwicki qualified second fastest and finished in second place at his first career NASCAR race, which took place at the Milwaukee Mile, several city blocks from where he grew up. Later that year, he finished seventh at Charlotte and fifth at Bristol. The following year, Kulwicki placed sixteenth in the season-opening Busch Series race at Daytona. Although he won the pole position at that year's event in Milwaukee, he finished fourteenth because of engine problems. Kulwicki's Busch Series successes caught car owner Bill Terry's eye and he offered Kulwicki a chance to race for him in several Winston Cup events.|$|E
5|$|March {{was more}} {{successful}} in selling large numbers of customer cars in the lower formulae. Mosley organised extensive test sessions for the 1971 cars for journalists and drivers, and arranged a successful scheme <b>for</b> <b>drivers</b> to rent cars and engines for the season, rather than buying them outright. Losing money on a deal to supply Jochen Neerpasch, then motorsport manager at Ford, with a Formula Two car paid off when Neerpasch moved to BMW and offered March an exclusive deal to use BMW's Formula Two engine for the 1973 season. March cars powered by BMW engines won five of the next 11 European Formula Two championships. However, BMW also put pressure on Herd {{to concentrate on the}} Formula Two programme. As a result, he spent less time with the Formula One team, where Mosley started to act as a race engineer.|$|E

5|$|On December 27, 2011 (76 FR 81133), FMCSA {{published}} a final rule amending its hours-of-service (HOS) regulations <b>for</b> <b>drivers</b> of property-carrying commercial motor vehicles (CMVs). The final rule adopted several {{changes to the}} HOS regulations, including a new provision requiring drivers to take a rest break during the work day under certain circumstances. Drivers may drive a CMV only if 8 hours or less have passed {{since the end of}} the driver’s last off-duty or sleeper-berth period of at least 30 minutes. FMCSA did not specify when drivers must take the 30-minute break, but the rule requires that they wait no longer than 8 hours after the last off-duty or sleeper-berth period of that length or longer to take the break. Drivers who already take shorter breaks during the work day could comply with the rule by taking one of the shorter breaks and extending it to 30 minutes. The new requirement took effect on July 1, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the month}} of July, the Autodromo Nazionale Monza race track's main {{straight}} was straightened and the Variante Goodyear and Seconda Variante chicanes were reconfigured by the race organisers to become a series of narrower corners with the exit away from the entry of turn one. The run-off areas around the two sections of the circuit were enlargened. Some of the drivers, however, were unhappy with the modifications, though, as there were fears of a multi-car accident on the first lap. Coulthard claimed that the new corner would make braking more difficult and was concerned over the amount of penalties issued to other competitors. However, Michael Schumacher believed his and other teams would be less concerned with suspension damage. Jean Alesi {{who was the first}} driver to test the new circuit, said that it would be easier <b>for</b> <b>drivers</b> to pull off the track {{in the event of a}} technical issue.|$|E
5|$|Rain hit {{the circuit}} on Saturday afternoon, ending {{three hours before}} the session started, {{resulting}} in several damp patches on the circuit though the air temperature remained hot. Different sections of the circuit dried out at different rates making it difficult <b>for</b> <b>drivers</b> to tell precisely how wet or dry certain corners were. The teams ran intermediate tyres before switching to the super-soft tyre as the session progressed. Some drivers ran deep into turn five. Vettel was the fastest driver of the session {{with a time of}} 1:48.028 set in the last twenty minutes of the one-hour period. The time was four-tenths faster than championship rival Alonso. Hamilton was third fastest, two-thousandths of a second in front of Massa. Rosberg was fifth, ahead of Webber and Nico Hülkenberg. Kubica, Sutil and Buemi completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Hispania Racing driver Bruno Senna's right-rear tyre got onto a white line at the Singapore Sling chicane and spun. Senna later brushed a wall entering the Esplanade Bridge in the final minute and stopped his car, causing the yellow-flags to be shown; drivers were unable to improve on their lap times because of the limited time available.|$|E
