5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Danielle Federici, was filmed {{during the early}} summer of 1994. It was filmed in black-and-white, and features Carey walking along the streets of New York, watching several different people, ranging from a small child to an elderly man, lonely {{and in need of}} a friend. Additionally, aside from several scenes of Carey and a large church choir in a large antechamber, the video is known as the first video in which Carey appears with straightened hair. Throughout her career up until that point, Carey had famously sported long, auburn curls. However, the video presented Carey's first image makeover, where she appears with bangs and a long straightened hairstyle. The video begins with scenes of Carey walking down a long New York street, with the addition of close ups of Carey's <b>face.</b> <b>As</b> <b>she</b> stares down the road, she witnesses a small girl, sitting alone in an alley corner, glaring into the sky. As the first chorus begins, Carey enters a large foyer, with a choir dressed in black singing perched atop a large staircase. During the second verse, she similarly witnesses an older man, who is sitting on a withered stoop.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E
25|$|In the 2003 revival {{starring}} Bernadette Peters, {{the final}} dialogue scene remains, but leaves the ending open to more interpretation from the audience. Louise {{walks through the}} stage door, with Rose following behind. Rose then turns to face the audience, a look of sadness and longing on her <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> takes {{one last look at}} the empty stage. She pauses and slowly closes the door.|$|E

60|$|We all {{bowed and}} said we should be delighted. Even Bastin {{appeared}} anxious to revisit Egypt in such company, though when he was there it seemed to bore him. But what she meant about taking us I could not guess. Nor had we time to ask her, for she went on, watching our <b>faces</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> spoke.|$|R
500|$|... "The Coup" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} Paul Lieberstein, who plays series regular Toby Flenderson, and was directed by executive producer and series creator Greg Daniels. Several cast members believed the episode contains Shakespearean themes, in particular elements of the Macbeth character Lady Macbeth in Angela's storyline. Lady Macbeth was depicted as an ambitious woman who [...] "exerted an evil influence over her husband," [...] characteristics that fit with Angela attempting to push her lover, Dwight, into power. In her weekly blog for TV Guide, actress Kate Flannery previewed the episode, [...] "Behind every great man is a pushy woman. Or in this case, a pushy, short, judgmental blonde named Angela. It's the ultimate Adam-and-Eve saga. Angela is about to push the apple in Dwight's <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> persuades {{him to try to}} take Michael's place at Dunder-Mifflin [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The video commences with a {{close-up}} shots of Cyrus' <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> counts in the backup band behind her. For a moment, she {{is replaced by}} a different girl holding a small stuffed monkey. Cyrus then reappears, holding onto her necklace and wearing a multicolored sequin sundress designed by Sass & Bide, black Chuck Taylor All-Stars, and leg warmers. Her wavy hair styled loose and in front of her shoulders. As Cyrus continues to sing, she is replaced by more girls holding different items, including teddy bears, stuffed animals, snow globes, and love letters. As the song approaches its chorus, Cyrus and the girls start dancing and jumping. Cyrus continues singing as she holds a white rose and a girl deletes a text message from her boyfriend. At one point, Cyrus holds a photograph of her and an ex-boyfriend with black curly hair, his face obscured by a doodle on a piece of notebook paper. At the end of the video, Cyrus blows the camera a kiss, mouths [...] "I love you," [...] and turns away.|$|E
500|$|In the Sticky & Sweet Tour, [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] was {{performed}} as the closing {{song of the}} [...] "Futuristic rave with Japanese influence" [...] section. During the last segment of the show, Madonna wore a futuristic robotic dress with plates on her shoulder and a wig with long curled hair. She opened the breastplate from the previous performance, and started singing [...] "Give It 2 Me". Parts of the lyrics of the song flashed on the screens {{in the style of}} a shooter video game, featuring 1980s games like Space Invaders and Asteroids. Gradually, more and more dancers joined Madonna, and together they started jumping on stage. Williams appeared on the screens to sing his lines. He made a special guest appearance, for the performances of [...] "Give It 2 Me", at the Madison Square Garden stop of the tour. Near the end of the performance, Madonna asked the crowd to sing along with her while she shouted, [...] "No one is ever going to stop me". The performance ended with video backdrops showing Madonna's sweaty, unsmiling, exhausted <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> disappeared behind the reformed cubicle-shaped screens, which showed the words, 'Game Over', and [...] "Holiday" [...] started playing in the background.|$|E

5000|$|... "Beautiful" [...] was pre-released on February 9, {{and also}} had a lyric video which {{contained}} childhood photos of Amber uploaded on S.M Entertainment's official YouTube channel on the same day. The song is an acoustic ballad, and its lyrics, written 3 years before its release, {{tells the story of}} the hardships the rapper <b>faced</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> achieved her dreams of becoming an entertainer.|$|R
60|$|Her voice died away, and her <b>face</b> burnt <b>as</b> <b>she</b> looked down; but a {{few words}} of {{interest}} led her on.|$|R
500|$|The {{rush for}} Madonna's fashion {{started with the}} music video for [...] "Lucky Star". In the video, Madonna wore an all-black outfit with leggings, ankle boots, and belly button, with her tangled hair tied in a floppy black ribbon. This was coupled with a shiny black miniskirt, an earring on her right ear, cut-off gloves and rubber bangles. Madonna's friend Erika Belle was {{credited}} with designing the outfit, although biographer Mary Cross noted that Madonna was after all wearing her day-to-day outfit. Mary Lambert, then a Rhode Island School of Design graduate, was decided for directing the video. However, Arthur Pierson replaced her as the director. Warner Bros. gave Pierson a small budget to make the video, shot in an afternoon. Madonna's brother, Christopher Ciccone, is a back-up dancer in the video. In his book Life with My Sister Madonna he says that although he was only paid $200 to dance in the video, {{at the time he}} was [...] "just happy to be part of it." [...] The video starts with the close-up of Madonna's <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> slides her sunglasses down her nose. This scene was a reference to the character of Lolita in Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film of the same name, and Audrey Hepburn in the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961). The image then fades to white, denoting the celestial stars dazzle, and then resumes itself in color. Madonna is shown dancing against a stark white background, along with closeups of her mesmerised gaze. She is accompanied by Belle and brother Christopher, as backup dancers. The video ends with the initial black-and-white image repeated, but in retrograde, as Madonna puts back on the sunglasses. The taking down and putting up of those sunglasses provided a frame to contain the song, functioning like a curtain that marks the opening and closing of a stage performance.|$|E
2500|$|While drawing Levi, Suruga {{attempted}} to make him appear younger than he does in Attack on Titan. [...] She noted that his lack of emotiveness {{made it difficult to}} choose which expressions to give him while drawing. [...] With Isabel, Suruga {{attempted to}} convey a [...] "lively, energetic" [...] character who, while [...] "very cute", was just as capable at fighting Titans as anyone else. [...] Suruga had difficulty drawing Furlan's <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> wanted to give him characteristics that would clearly distinguish him from the other two main characters. [...] Despite that, she found it surprisingly easy to copy the character's hairstyle from Namaniku ATK's original design.|$|E
2500|$|Corby {{was taken}} from her prison to a Bali {{hospital}} in June 2008 to be treated for depression. In July 2008, she was permitted to leave her hospital ward under armed guard to visit a beauty salon located within the hospital grounds to have her hair done and for a pedicure. While {{she was at the}} salon, word of her presence got out and, upon leaving the salon, Corby was faced with a large number of reporters. She attempted to hide her <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> left the salon and her doctor stated that her condition was [...] "back to zero" [...] and that additional treatment for depression would be needed. On 9 July 2008, she was returned to the prison, ending a stay of {{two and a half weeks}} in the hospital. Corby was again taken to the hospital on 22 May 2009 for depression.|$|E

2500|$|The album I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got {{featured}} Marco Pirroni and Kevin Mooney, of Adam and the Ants fame, {{and contained}} her international breakthrough hit [...] "Nothing Compares 2 U", a song written by Prince and originally recorded and released by a side project of his, The Family. Aided by a memorable and well received video by John Maybury which consisted almost solely of O'Connor's <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> performed the song, {{it became a}} massive international hit, reaching No. 1 in several countries. In Ireland it hit the top spot in July 1990 and remained there for 11 weeks; it is the eighth most successful single of the decade there. It had similar success in the UK, charting at No. 1 for 4 weeks, and in Germany (No. 1 for 11 weeks). In Australia, it reached No. 1 on the Top 100. It also claimed the No. 1 spot on the Hot 100 chart in the US. She also received Grammy nominations including Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. She eventually won the Grammy for Best Alternative Music Performance, but boycotted the award show.|$|E
2500|$|A {{writer of}} Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "this clip for the ballad 'Someone Like You' {{sticks to the}} singer's simple but emotionally direct {{approach}} with black-and-white footage that lingers on her subtly expressive <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> lip-synchs to the tune while walking along sad, grey city streets." [...] Andrea Devaro of Long Island Press concluded, [...] "its simplicity beautifully portrays the complexity of emotions invoked in the song." [...] Leah Collins of Dose called Adele [...] "'60s bombshell glam" [...] {{and said that the}} video's [...] "simplicity is its strength." [...] She added: [...] "There's something about streetlamps, cafes and the River Seine that lend an air of melancholic elegance to what would otherwise be just another walk of shame by a girl with two-day-old hair. Not everyone gets to indulge in moments as tragic but beautiful as a weepy solitary walk through Paris landmarks. But then, we don't all have voices as tragic and beautiful as Adele's either." [...] A more mixed review was given by AOLs Ashley Percival who called the video predictable and added [...] "It's all very pleasant, but after all this time, what's the point?". Nicole Eggenberger [...] of OK! wrote that Adele [...] "created the perfect music video to go along with her hauntingly beautiful ballad" [...] and further described it as [...] "simple yet stunning." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wray {{was also}} a member {{of one of the most}} famous B-movie units at work during what is now viewed as the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood -- a group whose {{creative}} energy and inventiveness made Lewton's success possible. She spoke about working with the group in a conversation with her daughter many years later, a recollection that shines a clear light on the group's chemistry and skill, and the special place it held in Wray's heart:She rarely spoke about her early career or the McCarthy era. [...] But when I asked once what it was like working with Lewton, she smiled -- thought about it for a long moment -- and then told me about the night the group spent figuring out how to build to the first murder in The Leopard Man. [...] The scene she had written was pure psychological terror, trading on very basic fears -- of the dark, of being punished unjustly, locked out of your own home, abandoned by people you trust -- and at the same time it sets up the mystery that is the premise of the entire film. [...] They were under pressure to get this sequence right, and almost everyone was there that night. The session went well into the small hours of the morning, was filled with laughter, and included a hilarious riff as one of them experimented with a set of castanets, which turned out to be the key to building the tension and suspense. They worked their way through a dozen different shot sequences before they were satisfied and, listening to her, I had the very strong impression that they would have come up with that same elegant, powerful scene even if they had been working with an A-movie budget and had more time. [...] As Agee so famously observed about Lewton, these were people who understood film and cared about human beings. [...] I can still see the smile on her <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> recalled that night. [...] -- Stefani Warren, September 2016 ...|$|E
