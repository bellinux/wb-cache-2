I {{used to hear}} those {{wonderful}} stories in the cutting room that Tom and Dick and Stuart would tell about Superman and that's how I kind of got the ideas for the plots of 'Taking Flight' and 'Making Superman'". Donner commented, [...] "There are a few shots where Chris 's costume looked green. We went in and cleaned that up, bringing the color {{back to where it}} should be." [...] Thau wanted to make the film shorter: [...] "I wanted to take out the damn poem where Lois is reciting a poem [...] when they're flying around. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> take out a lot of that car chase where it was just generic action… It was like a two-minute car chase.

[...] It was followed by a box set release in the same month, containing [...] "bare bones" [...] editions of Superman II, Superman III, and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. In November 2006, a four-disc special edition was released, followed by an HD DVD release and Blu-ray.

For Sparks, {{there should}} be an [...] "element that [...] the characters apart in order to have drama".

60|$|When {{appointed}} brigadier-general I at {{once thought}} it proper {{that one of}} my aides should come from the regiment I had been commanding, and so selected Lieutenant C. B. Lagow. While living in St. Louis, I had had a desk in the law office of McClellan, Moody and Hillyer. Difference in views between the members of the firm on the questions of the day, and general hard times in the border cities, had broken up this firm. Hillyer was quite a young man, then in his twenties, and very brilliant. I asked him to accept a place on my staff. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> take one man from my new home, Galena. The canvass in the Presidential campaign the fall before had brought out a young lawyer by the name of John A. Rawlins, who proved himself one of the ablest speakers in the State. He was also a candidate for elector on the Douglas ticket. When Sumter was fired upon and the integrity of the Union threatened, there was no man more ready to serve his country than he. I wrote at once asking him to accept the position of assistant adjutant-general with the rank of captain, on my staff. He was about entering the service as major of a new regiment then organizing in the north-western part of the State; but he threw this up and accepted my offer.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have had}} a bad sick week, mostly in bed--with putting pen to paper quite out of my power: {{otherwise}} I should sooner have thanked you for the so generous spirit of that letter, and told you, with emotion, how much it has touched me. I am really more overcome than I can say by your having been able to indulge in such freedom of mind and grace of speculation, during these dark days, on behalf of my poor old rather truncated edition, in fact entirely frustrated one--which has the grotesque likeness for me of a sort of miniature Ozymandias of Egypt ("look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!")--round which the lone and level sands stretch further away than ever. It is indeed consenting to be waved aside a little into what was once blest literature to so much as answer the question you are so handsomely impelled to make--but my very statement about the matter can only be, alas, a melancholy, a blighted confusion. That Edition has been, {{from the point of}} view of profit either to the publishers or to myself, practically a complete failure; vaguely speaking, it doesn't sell--that is, my annual report of what it does--the whole 24 vols.--in this country amounts to about £25 from the Macmillans; and the ditto from the Scribners in the U.S. to very little more. I am past all praying for anywhere; I remain at my age (which you know,) and after my long career, utterly, insurmountably, unsaleable. And the original preparation of that collective and selective series involved really the extremity of labour--all my [...] "earlier" [...] things--of which the Bostonians would have been, if included, one--were so intimately and interestingly revised. The edition is from that point of view really a monument (like Ozymandias) which has never had the least intelligent critical justice done it--or any sort of critical attention at all paid it--and the artistic problem involved in my scheme was a deep and exquisite one, and moreover was, as I held, very effectively solved. Only it took such time--and such taste--in other words such aesthetic light. No more commercially thankless job of the literary order was (Prefaces and all--they of a thanklessness!) accordingly ever achieved. The immediate inclusion of the Bostonians was rather deprecated by the publishers (the Scribners, who were very generally and in a high degree appreciative: I make no complaint of them at all!)--and there were reasons for which <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> wait: we always meant that that work should eventually come in. Revision of it loomed peculiarly formidable and time-consuming (for intrinsic reasons,) and as other things were more pressing and more promptly feasible I allowed it to stand over--with the best intentions, and also in company with a small number more of provisional omissions. But by this time it had stood over, disappointment had set in; the undertaking had begun to announce itself as a virtual failure, and we stopped short where we were--that is when a couple of dozen volumes were out. From that moment, some seven or eight years ago, nothing whatever has been added to the series--and there is little enough appearance now that there will ever. Your good impression of the Bostonians greatly moves me--the thing was no success whatever on publication in the Century (where it came out,) and the late R. W. Gilder, of that periodical, wrote me at the time that they had never published anything that appeared so little to interest their readers. I felt about it myself then that it was probably rather a remarkable feat of objectivity--but I never was very thoroughly happy about it, and seem to recall that I found the subject and the material, after I had got launched in it, under some illusion, less interesting and repaying than I had assumed it to be. All the same I should have liked to review it for the Edition--it would have come out a much truer and more curious thing (it was meant to be curious from the first;) but there can be no question of that, or of the proportionate Preface to have been written with it, at present--or probably ever within my span of life. Apropos of which matters I at this moment hear from Heinemann that four or five of my books that he has have quite (entirely) ceased to sell and that he must break up the plates. Of course he must; I have nothing to say against it; and the things in question are mostly all in the Edition. But such is [...] "success"! I should have liked to write that Preface to the Bostonians--which will never be written now. But think of noting now that that is a thing that has perished! ...|$|E
