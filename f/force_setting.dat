25|$|When the {{deliverable}} asset {{exists in}} plentiful supply, {{or may be}} freely created, then {{the price of a}} futures contract is determined via arbitrage arguments. This is typical for stock index futures, treasury bond futures, and futures on physical commodities when they are in supply (e.g. agricultural crops after the harvest). However, when the deliverable commodity is not in plentiful supply or when it does not yet exist - for example on crops before the harvest or on Eurodollar Futures or Federal funds rate futures (in which the supposed underlying instrument is to be created upon the delivery date) - the futures price cannot be fixed by arbitrage. In this scenario there is only one <b>force</b> <b>setting</b> the price, which is simple supply and demand for the asset in the future, as expressed by supply and demand for the futures contract.|$|E

40|$|Let G be a graph, and Z {{a subset}} of its vertices, which we color black, while the {{remaining}} are colored white. We define the skew color change rule as follows: if u is a vertex of G, and exactly one of its neighbors v, is white, then change the color of v to black. A set Z is a skew zero <b>forcing</b> <b>set</b> for G if {{the application of the}} skew color change rule (as many times as necessary) will result in all the vertices in G colored black. A set Z is a minimum skew zero <b>forcing</b> <b>set</b> for G if it is a skew zero <b>forcing</b> <b>set</b> for G of least cardinality.

40|$|Observations {{and simple}} {{theoretical}} arguments {{suggest that the}} Northern Hemisphere (NH) stratospheric polar vortex is stronger in winters following major volcanic eruptions. However, recent studies show that climate models forced by prescribed volcanic aerosol fields fail to reproduce this effect. We investigate the impact of volcanic aerosol forcing on stratospheric dynamics, including {{the strength of the}} NH polar vortex, in ensemble simulations with the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model. The model is forced by four different prescribed <b>forcing</b> <b>sets</b> representing the radiative properties of stratospheric aerosol following the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo: two <b>forcing</b> <b>sets</b> are based on observations, and are commonly used in climate model simulations, and two <b>forcing</b> <b>sets</b> are constructed based on coupled aerosol–climate model simulations. For all forcings, we find that simulated temperature and zonal wind anomalies in the NH high latitudes are not directly impacted by anomalous volcanic aerosol heating. Instead, high-latitude effects result from enhancements in stratospheric residual circulation, which in turn result, at least in part, from enhanced stratospheric wave activity. High-latitude effects are therefore much less robust than would be expected if they were the direct result of aerosol heating. Both observation-based <b>forcing</b> <b>sets</b> result in insignificant changes in vortex strength. For the model-based <b>forcing</b> <b>sets,</b> the vortex response is found {{to be sensitive to the}} structure of the forcing, with one <b>forcing</b> <b>set</b> leading to significant strengthening of the polar vortex in rough agreement with observation-based expectations. Differences in the dynamical response to the <b>forcing</b> <b>sets</b> imply that reproducing the polar vortex responses to past eruptions, or predicting the response to future eruptions, depends on accurate representation of the space–time structure of the volcanic aerosol forcing...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} forced {{orientation}} of graphs {{was first introduced}} by Chartrand et al. in 1994. If, for a given assignment of directions to a subset S of the edges of a graph G, there exists an orientation of E(G) S, so that the resulting graph is strongly connected, then that given assignment {{is said to be}} extendible to a strong orientation of G. A <b>forcing</b> <b>set</b> for a strong orientation D of G is a subset of E(G), to which the assignment of orientations from D, can uniquely be extended to E and thus result D. The size of the smallest <b>forcing</b> <b>set</b> for a strong orientation D of G is denoted by fD(G).
