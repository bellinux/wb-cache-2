Following further unauthorised digging the estate took steps to stop it. Before the problem was resolved the turmoil surrounding unconstrained and persistent gold digging by locals had caused Kemball to resign as estate commissioner, and Lord Stafford, the local Sutherland parliamentary representative, to resign.|$|E
25|$|The camel {{companies}} {{consisted of}} a small headquarters and four sections, each of seven groups of four men. The <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> was 130 men, all armed with Lee–Enfields, the standard British bolt action rifle of the time. However the move from patrol to a more active combat role in August 1916 led to a re-organisation. Each company added a machine-gun section of fifteen men with three Lewis guns; the company headquarters also received extra staff. All this increased company strength to 184 men. The four companies were expected to operate as independent units that travelled by camel but then dismounted to fight as infantrymen. Following the practise of cavalry and mounted infantry units, one man of each group of four held the camels when the team was in action, which reduced a team's firepower by a quarter. However it was soon discovered that camels were not as nervous as horses when faced with artillery and rifle fire, and one man would look after twelve to sixteen camels once the troopers had dismounted.|$|E
25|$|Although the United Mine Workers of America {{failed to}} win {{recognition}} by the company, the strike had a lasting impact both on conditions at the Colorado mines and on labor relations nationally. John D. Rockefeller, Jr. engaged labor relations expert and future Canadian Prime Minister W. L.

There was to be no discrimination against workers who had belonged to unions, and the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> union. The Rockefeller plan was accepted by the miners in a vote. Rockefeller also brought in pioneer public relations guru Ivy Lee, who warned that the Rockefellers were losing public support and developed a strategy that Junior followed to repair it. It was necessary for Junior to overcome his shyness, go personally to Colorado {{to meet with the}} miners and their families, inspect the conditions of the homes and the factories, attend social events, and especially to listen closely to the grievances. This was novel advice, and attracted widespread media attention, which opened the way to resolve the conflict, and present a more humanized versions of the Rockefellers.|$|E

500|$|Cornwallis's predecessor, John Macpherson, had {{authorised}} {{negotiations with}} the sultan of Kedah for the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> trading post {{on the island of}} Penang. [...] Captain Francis Light, a trader familiar with the East Indies, negotiated an agreement in which the sultan, who was surrounded by powerful adversaries, received a share of the trade profits and a defensive military alliance in exchange for Penang. [...] Captain Light made representations to the sultan that the company had agreed to these terms, and occupied the island in August 1786. [...] Cornwallis, concerned that the military aspects of the agreement might draw the company into conflicts with the sultan's adversaries or the Dutch, withheld approval of the agreement and requested the company's directors to decide the issue. [...] When the company refused the military alliance, the sultan began blockading the island, renamed Prince of Wales Island by Light, and started in 1790 to accumulate troops with the view toward forcibly evicting the British. Cornwallis's brother William, then with the Royal Navy in the area, sailed from Penang to pick up troops in India for its defence. Captain Light, however, routed the sultan's forces in April 1791 before those reinforcements arrived. An agreement was then signed in which the company paid the sultan an annual stipend for the use of Penang. [...] The fort that Captain Light constructed to protect Penang's principal town, George Town, became known as Fort Cornwallis in the earl's honour.|$|E
