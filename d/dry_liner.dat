5000|$|A {{wet liner}} {{cylinder}} block features cylinder walls that are entirely removable, which {{fit into the}} block by means of special gaskets. They {{are referred to as}} [...] "wet liners" [...] because their outer sides come in direct contact with the engine's coolant. In other words, the liner is the entire wall, rather than being merely a sleeve. Wet liner designs are popular with European manufacturers, most notably Renault and Peugeot, who continue to use them to the present. <b>Dry</b> <b>liner</b> designs use either the block's material or a discrete liner inserted into the block to form the backbone of the cylinder wall. Additional sleeves are inserted within, which remain [...] "dry" [...] on their outside, surrounded by the block's material. With either wet or <b>dry</b> <b>liner</b> designs, the liners (or sleeves) can be replaced, potentially allowing overhaul or rebuild without replacement of the block itself; but in reality, they are difficult to remove and install, and for many applications (such as most late-model cars and trucks), an engine will never undergo such a procedure in its working lifespan. It is likelier to be scrapped, with new equipment—engine or entire vehicle—replacing it. This is sometimes rightfully disparaged as a symptom of a throw-away society, but on the other hand, it is actually sometimes more cost-efficient and even environmentally protective to recycle machinery and build new instances with efficient manufacturing processes (and superior machine performance and emission control) than it is to overvalue old machinery and craft production.|$|E
50|$|The {{last of the}} {{prototype}} A-0 series was V8, which was completed in October. It switched engines entirely and mounted the Daimler-Benz DB 600Aa, along with a three-bladed, fully adjustable, all-metal propeller. The engine was a huge change for the aircraft, producing 716 kW (960 hp) for takeoff and had 33.9 L (2,069 in³) displacement at 686 kg (1,510 lb), compared that to the Jumo 210Da's 514 kW (690 hp) from 19.7 L (1,202 in³) {{at about the same}} weight. V8 was seen primarily as a testbed for the new engine, and more importantly, its cooling systems. The DB used a <b>dry</b> <b>liner</b> in the engine that resulted in poor heat flow, so more of the heat was removed by oil as opposed to water, requiring changes to the cooling systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{main body}} of the engine was a single {{aluminium}} casting, with grey cast iron <b>dry</b> <b>liners</b> to the cylinders. The crankshafts were also of cast iron.|$|R
5000|$|The 3.8-litre {{version was}} {{released}} in 1958, initially for {{the last of the}} XK150s and the Mark IX saloon. It retained the 3.4’s bore centres and 106 mm stroke but was bored out to 87 mm for a total displacement of (3,781 cc / 230.7 cu-in). The distance between the cylinder bores was sufficiently small that it was decided to fit <b>dry</b> <b>liners</b> to the bores. The 3.8 had a number of detail differences from the 3.4, particularly in its valve gear and carburetion. The standard 3.8 produced [...] SAE gross and up to [...] SAE gross in the XK150SE with the straight port head.|$|R
5000|$|A diesel {{version of}} the 948 cc A-Series engine (producing [...] at 2,500 rpm and [...] torque at 1,750 rpm) was {{produced}} for the BMC Mini Tractor. It was developed {{with the help of}} Ricardo Consulting Engineers. This engine has <b>dry</b> <b>liners.</b> The block is almost identical to the petrol engine. the oil pump has been removed from the camshaft and is driven by an extension to what would have been the distributor drive. A petrol version of this modified engine was 'reverse-engineered' for use in the Mini Tractor whilst retaining parts commonality with the diesel variant, rather than using a standard petrol A-Series unit. The diesel A-Series was also sold as a marine engine under the BMC name alongside the diesel B-Series engines.|$|R
40|$|Setting {{expansion}} of 4 phosphate-bonded investments was measured under 3 different conditions: a hygroscopic condition, a condition using a ring lined {{with a wet}} liner and a condition using a ring lined with a <b>dry</b> <b>liner.</b> Accuracy of castings of a Ni-Cr alloy made {{in each of the}} 4 investments in rings lined with a wet liner was measured. One investment exhibited negative potential for hygroscopic expansion. Expansion of all investments in wet-lined rings was not significantly different from their expansion under the hygroscopic condition. There {{was no significant difference in}} setting expansion between the investments when a wet liner was used. Significant differences in accuracy existed between castings produced in the different investments using a wet liner. The correlation between the setting {{expansion of}} the investments using a wet liner and the accuracy of castings produced using a wet liner was not high and was not significant. Comparison between investments with regard to their ability to produce accurate castings in terms of mould expansion by measurement of setting expansion is of no value...|$|E

5000|$|On August 8, 2014, CodComm made a tweak to Frank's format. Songs from 1990 {{through the}} present were {{completely}} removed from rotation, {{with the exception}} of a few select songs from the 1990s. A large amount of songs from the 1970s and a few select songs from the 1960s have been added. Most of the pre-1980 songs added back into rotation have not been played on Frank since the September 2012 format tweak. Songs from the 1980s were mainly unaffected by the adjustment, however the modifications were significant enough to reclassify the format from Adult Hits to Classic Hits. This put Frank musically in line with other Classic Hits stations such as WCBS-FM and KRTH. In October 2014, personalities began promoting the new 93.9 frequency on-air. Although the station continues to be branded [...] "Frank 93-5", the tagline [...] "and now at 93.9 for the Upper Cape" [...] was added. Voiceover talent James Justice was also phased out and replaced by John Tesh. John began to voice both station promos and <b>dry</b> <b>liners</b> that play over song intros at times when no on-air personality is on the air. By year's end, Janet Birchfield and Bumper Morgan had parted ways with CodComm.|$|R

40|$|Ocean {{transportation}} {{has been}} mainly studied {{from an economic}} and strategic point of view. This paper adopts an operations management approach aiming at {{the identification of the}} value-adding attributes that characterize the ocean transportation industry. This is achieved by using Johansson et al. 's 1 four value metrics—service, quality, cost, time—which are used for the identification of the contribution that different factors make to the total created value. In this paper, multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) has been used to measure and compare the value of different processes of various sectors of the ocean transportation industry. The application of MAUT methodology is illustrated with an example from the four sectors of the industry: <b>liner,</b> <b>dry</b> bulk, liquid bulk and specialized. Results suggest that there is strong emphasis placed by ocean transportation companies on quality and that there is differentiating importance put on service and cost by different sectors. Time is seen as the lowest value contributor by all four sectors of the surveyed companies...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the years}} the demand for {{ornamental}} bromeliads has grown {{and is expected to}} grow even more in the near future. The bromeliad production chain is already highly specialized, starting with companies that have specialized themselves in propagation and marketing of the resulting liners (small young plants adapted to the greenhouse). To cover the increasing market these companies have to merchandize bromeliads over short as well as long distances. Quality problems arising during transport can cause severe economical losses. Besides mechanical damage, physiological damage becomes a problem of growing concern. Little is yet known about transport conditions or handling methods which can allow safer transport resulting in less damaged plants. In this report the authors investigated the possibilities and effects of drying young plants prior to transport on post transport re-growth as dried plants are less vulnerable to both mechanical and physiological damage. For the Aechmea and Guzmania cultivar investigated, it can be stated that <b>drying</b> of young <b>liners</b> till 70 % Relative Water Content (RWC) prior to transport causes no post transport growth reduction. Moreover RWC values can be linked to simple weight measurements to implement this guideline in commercial practice. Furthermore a time saving treatment of cutting the roots {{at the end of the}} shoot instead of washing them to remove soil before transport, delivered satisfying results concerning both drying characteristics and re-growth after transport. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of a gasketless interface, which was used successfully to couple an aluminium cylinder head to an open deck design cylinder block. The cylinder block was manufactured from aluminium, featuring shrink fit <b>dry</b> cast iron <b>liners.</b> Extensive CAE modelling was employed to implement the gasketless interface and thus avoid using a conventional metal or fiber based cylinder head gasket. The engine was specifically designed and configured for the purpose, being a 430 cm 3, highly turbocharged (TC) twin cylinder in-line arrangement with double overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder. Most of the engine components were specially cast or machined from billets. The new design removed the conventional head gasket and relied on the correct amount of face pressure generated by interference between the cylinder head and block to seal the interface. This had advantages in improving the structural integrity of the weak open deck design. Extensive FEM analysis determined the correct amount of interference needed for successful operation under all operating conditions. Extensive thermal analysis concluded that removing the conventional gasket {{had the advantage of}} improving the heat path between the cylinder head and block, as the gasket behaves as an insulator. The possibility of gasket failure due to abnormal combustion is also eliminated. The design proved successful in operation, withstanding knock amplitudes of 30 bar, in-cylinder pressures exceeding 100 bar and high combustion temperatures. The engine completed extensive static and transient testing with no interface problems after initial development, recording 25 bar brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) on pump gasoline. 13 - 16 NovemberOpen Acces...|$|R
40|$|Cast stone (CS) {{is a form}} of pre-cast {{concrete}} widely, used in architectural applications for decorating and building face in place of natural stone due its superior features. The present study was an attempt in using of local lightweight aggregate materials (LWAM) as an alternative to percentage of coarse aggregate, and glass wastes as alternatives to percentages of fine aggregate in cast stone normal mixtures with white cement and plasticizer admixture. The CS products were cured after 24 hrs using of two different processes: water curing (at 23 C° for 3 days) and steam curing (at 60 C° for 14 hrs). Then the products were characterized by tests of compressive strength, design, absorption, flexure strength and <b>liner</b> <b>drying</b> shrinkage. The addition of alternative materials was done by trial mixes (M 0 -M 3) through 3 groups (A, B, and C) according to standards. Group A: design of reference mixtures of CS with compressive strength of 46. 3 MPa and the absorption of 6. 19 %, Group B: design of mixtures containing 50 % LWA were 16 % lighter than those of Group A with compressive strength of 43. 6 MPa and 11 % improvement in the absorption, Group C: design of mixtures containing (50 and 75 %) glass waste with compressive strength of (47. 5 - 44. 3 MPa) and the absorption of (5. 3 - 4. 7 %), respectively. The modified steam curing process (curing after 24 hrs casting) done in this study could prove its effectiveness in the achievement of the required compressive strength in comparison with the normal process (direct curing after casting) due to the effect of such new process in providing the more uniform distribution of the cement gel with good physical properties. Results from the flexural strength test could prove the achievement of the required levels (6. 9 – 6. 3 at 50 – 75 % glass waste addition) recorded in the standard...|$|R
