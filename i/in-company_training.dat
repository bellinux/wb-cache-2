40|$|It {{is true that}} {{participation}} in <b>in-company</b> further <b>training</b> has increased considerably in Germany {{over the past few}} years, nevertheless it ranks in the lower-medium range in European comparison. At the same time, the demand for skilled manpower is increasing steadily while the chances of finding employment are declining more and more for low-skilled or unskilled workers. Especially small and medium-sized companies in Germany are affected by a lack of skilled labour despite high unemployment. Investment in the employees' human capital in order to adapt to the company's demand for vocational skills is a key instrument to meet these difficulties. In this study, the commitment to <b>in-company</b> further <b>training</b> of small and medium-sized companies in Germany and Denmark is empirically examined and evaluated, using the data of a Europe-wide company survey (CVTS II), and taking into account the arrangement of the further training systems in both countries. Seen from an education and employment policy perspective, Denmark is very successful, which is also reflected in a strong commitment to <b>in-company</b> further <b>training.</b> Therefore, the question is investigated whether the deficits in further training in small and medium-sized German companies can be attributed originally to company size, or whether the institutional arrangements of the different further training systems play the key role.

30|$|However, our central {{analytical}} interest specifically {{refers to}} those {{factors that are}} relevant in assessing in-company IVET’s significance. Therefore, we will only present a few selected hypotheses about company characteristics’ impact on the make-or-buy decision. In our first hypothesis, we propose {{a positive relationship between}} <b>in-company</b> vocational <b>training</b> and the company’s evaluation of apprenticeship training’s cost-benefit ratio. But it is not sufficient to just take firms’ perception of costs as a covariate, as costs have to be seen in comparison to the benefits. Therefore, we also include the evaluation of benefits in our analysis. Costs and benefits both are dependent on the basic conditions for training in the company.|$|R
30|$|To {{meet their}} demands for {{qualified}} workers, companies essentially choose between providing their own initial vocational {{education and training}} (IVET) or recruiting differently qualified staff from the external labour market. In Germany, the overriding importance ascribed to <b>in-company</b> apprenticeship <b>training</b> has traditionally affected this decision. Over their lifetimes, more than 50 per cent of a given school leavers cohort will have received basic occupational training through the dual IVET system (Gericke, [2014]), which includes firms and part-time vocational schools as learning venues. However, the choice of whether and which individuals should participate in an initial vocational training programme rests exclusively with the companies. The following paper therefore focuses {{on the question of}} which different key company-related factors the recruitment of new apprentices and (unskilled and skilled) workers from the external labour market fundamentally depends on.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} years, {{the demand for}} {{employees}} {{in the health care}} sector has increased. Due to the demographic change, the demand for skilled employees can be expected to continue to rise in this sector. Against this background, this article tries to study empirically the manpower requirements in health care, using the data of two representative establishment surveys. What is of particular importance here are the questions as to how far this demand can be met by recruiting on the external labour market, and what role <b>in-company</b> further <b>training</b> plays in this context. First, the current and future manpower requirements of the health care sector are compared with those of the other economic sectors, using the data of the IAB establishment panel. Then the company survey on manpower requirements and training in health care, which was carried out in the spring of 2002, is consulted to obtain more precise information on the specific problems concerning the search for employees and the filling of jobs in this sector. The corresponding descriptive analyses prove that the companies of the health care sector do indeed have a high demand for skilled employees that cannot always be met solely by external recruitment. Finally, based on these findings, the relationship between skill needs and <b>in-company</b> further <b>training</b> is examined using multivariate analyses. Here it can be shown that companies with demand for skilled employees are particularly committed to further training. However, as the majority of the company-supported further training schemes take place at least in part during working hours and are counterbalanced by the remaining employees doing extra work, the problem arises that the shortage of staff is only shifted within the company when acting in such a way. A solution to this problem is provided by the instrument of job-rotation as laid down in the Job-AQTIV Law. The results of a further survey are to prove whether this is in fact taken up by the companies of the health care sector.

50|$|Nearly {{two thirds}} of those {{entering}} upper secondary education enter the vocational education and training system. At this level, vocational education and training is mainly provided through the ‘dual system’. Students spend some {{of their time in}} a vocational school; some of their time doing an apprenticeship at a host company; and for most programmes, students attend industry courses at an industry training centre to develop complementary practical skills relating to the occupation at hand. Common patterns are for students to spend one- two days per week at the vocational school and three-four days doing the apprenticeship at the host company; alternatively they alternate between some weeks attending classes at the vocational school and some weeks attending industry courses at an industry training centre. A different pattern is to begin the programme with most of the time devoted to in-school education and gradually diminishing the amount of in-school education in favour of more <b>in-company</b> <b>training.</b>|$|E
40|$|A major {{proposition}} is that dual training arrangements alone do {{not necessarily}} solve quality problems {{in the delivery of}} vocational education and training (VET) nor improve VET links to the labor market. An essential strategy for Australia should be to further develop holistic training courses linked to apprenticeship models and embed both into a dual system and a comprehensive system of quality control of VET. The German dual system is an alternating training structure. Training occurs in a company providing the apprenticeship and in a compulsory vocational part-time school. Conditions of apprenticeship are closely linked with the prerequisite of homogeneous training schemes based on governmental training ordinances. Companies provide training opportunities on a totally voluntary basis. Two basic types of <b>in-company</b> VET are <b>training</b> as part of the working process and training pursued in a specific training environment.

50|$|The Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges, {{popularly known}} as CSPC, {{is the brainchild of}} some Prominent Nabueños who have long dreamed of having their college. Its {{establishment}} came into reality {{as a result of the}} feasibility study initiated by the defunct Bicol River Basin Development Program (BRBDP). Said undertaking is an inter agency commitment with the aim of promoting a balance agro-industrial development in the region to achieve the national development goals of the 80’s. The idea of having a community college within Nabua was first conceived by then Municipal Mayor, Atty. Ulpiano D. Duran, Sr. so that poor and deserving Nabueños who wish to take post secondary and collegiate courses could be freed from the burden of going to other places and save a lot of their education. With the support of his Vice Mayor, Hon. Sofio Barela, Sr. the Sangguniang Bayan passed a resolution for the creation of a community college within the Nabua National High School. Atty. Duran submitted the resolution to then Governor Felix A. Fuentebella for approval and funding assistance. Considering the merit of the request, Governor Fuentebella deemed it wise to indorse the proposal to BRBDP Director, Col. Lorenzo Ballecer, a Nabueño, who then initiated the conduct of the feasibility study by his technical men with the assistance of some personnel of Nabua National High School. On the course of the study, the team did not only consider the establishment of a community college but also the possibility of putting up a state tertiary institution in the area. As a result of the study conducted, it came out to be very promising if a Polytechnic College would be created. This was based on the premise that very crucial to the overall development scheme is the rationalization of the technical and vocational education with an updated curricular and linkage programs to match the needs of industries and entrepreneurs for skilled and dedicated manpower. With the very strong representation of his father, Assemblyman Arnulfo P. Fuentebella sponsored a bill creating a Polytechnic College within the Nabua National High School using the result of the feasibility as basis, which later become Batas Pambansa Bilang 512, approved by the President Ferdinand E. Marcos on June 10, 1983. Sec. 2 BP 512 states that: “the College shall primarily provide higher technological, professional, and vocational instruction and training in fisheries, trades and technology, arts and sciences, as well as short term technical and vocational courses, as the Board of Trustees may deem necessary, and shall promote researches in the exploration and conservation of natural resources in the province.” The immediate targets are the graduates of the barangay, private and public high schools, out of school youths and drop outs within Rinconada area, which comprises six municipalities and one city: Nabua, Baao, Bula, Bato, Buhi, Balatan and Iriga City. The first organizational meeting of the college was held on February 22, 1985 at the Provincial Capitol of Camarines Sur. Deputy Minister Vedasto G. Suarez who represented the MECS Minister Jaime C. Laya, presided over the meeting. Government officials present were: Hon. Felix A. Fuentebella, Governor; Atty. Fernando O. Beriña, Provincial Kagawad; Atty. Ulpiano D. Duran Sr., Municipal Mayor; Dir. Carmelo R. Villacorta, BRBDP Director; Dr. Franciscpo Pili, BFAR Director; Dr. Ciriaco N. Divinagracia, CSSAC President; Engr. Aproniano Los Baños, Provincial Engineer; Mr. Constancio Cater, Provincial Administrator; Mr. Germites C. Dineros, NNHS Principal; Atty. Magno Catabijan Sr., MECS Legal Officer; Atty. John Imlan, PASUC Administrative Officer. An Ad Hoc Committee was created headed by Dr. Ciriaco N. Divinagracia, the designated officer in charge. The committee was tasked to prepare the implementing guidelines for the operationalization of the college. During its second organizational meeting on April 1, 1985, the implementing guidelines were approved and Provincial Kagawad Fernando O. Beriña was designated Officer in charge. With only eleven (11) personnel; five (5) full-time instructors and six (6) administrative Personnel, the College has initially managed to run its affair. A total approximation of Five hundred thousand pesos (P500, 000.00) was approved by the Provincial Government of Camarines Sur for the 1985 operation of the college as provided for in BP 512. Thereafter, the operation and maintenance shall be incorporated in subsequent General Appropriation Act. May 7, 1985 was a red letter day for CSPC when the college opens its door for enrolment. For the first ten days, it seemed as if the target of 240 students could not be attained. But when enrolment closed on May 27, 1985, the target was overshot by 105 students or a total of 345 students, broken down as follows; One Year Junior Business Machine Certificate, 87; One Year Junior Electrical Certificates, 91; One Year Junior construction Technical Certificate, 80. Having no building of its own to accommodate its enrollees, a small office and six classrooms of NNHS war damage building were temporarily offered for use after classes, while drafting classes were held at the library. On September 25, 1986, Dr, Lylia Corporal-Seña was appointed as the first President of CSPC. Under her able leadership, she negotiated the temporary use of the Gabaldon Building owned by the Municipal Government of Nabua to accommodate the increasing enrolment. Day class schedules were opened. In the later part of 1986, the college rented a residential house owned by the Regalado Family to house congested offices at the War Damaged Building. This was the first attempt of the college to stand on its feet. Inspired by the strong determination of the leadership of Dr. Seña, a three classroom building was donated by the Late Engr. Cleto Descalso, a Retired US Navy. This was the first building erected at the swampy - 8 hectares site donated by the Provincial Government of Camarines Sur. In the same year, the Parents Teachers Association initiated the construction of a four classroom cottage made of Light Local Materials. In the latter part of 1987, classes housed at the War Damaged building were all transferred to the new site. Unfortunately, the cottage lasted only for more than One Year when it was totally destroyed by the Typhoon Sisang. Under the leadership of Dr. Seña, the ladder type curriculum came in full swing. Altogether, programs on instruction, student activities, administrative concerns, and infrastructure development were given priority. With the end of her term, Mr. Ferdinand B. Valencia become the Officer-in-charge (March 1, 1993 - May 15, 1997) of the college thru the designation of the then DECS Secretary Armand V. Fabella. Conscious of the aim and objectives of technical education, improvements of program offered as well as infrastructure developments have been realized. Vital to student’s development were clear-out policies on the on-the-job training/ <b>in-company</b> training/ in-house <b>training</b> and affiliation as well as expansion of the scholarship programs on academic, band/ majorettes, publication, athletics, Sangguniang Kabataan and Barangay Scholars to poor but deserving students. Attempts for voluntary accreditation to AACCUP have been started. The campus was able to house more classrooms, college library, college museum, audio visual room, information technology building equipped with radio and communication dish satellite, computers, prayer room, chemistry and laboratory room, refrigeration and air conditioning room, machine shop, medical and dental clinics. Physics room, drafting, carpentry shop, typing pool, clinical and midwifery laboratory rooms. Construction of Automotive and Shop Building, phase 1 was completed in 1995, followed by the newly constructed Multi Purpose stage and landscaping of the campus contributed much in physical development. Likewise, sports and athletics facilities improved with the construction of volleyball, basketball and lawn tennis court, and backfilling of almost one hectare athletic and NROTC training field. College library has a total collection of 7,185 volumes of books. Owing to the growing commitment to serve the community, it was not a surprise to the college to produce topnotchers in the board examination: in 1995, Mr. Josuel M. Terano - 9th place in ME and Miss Melanie C. Gaspi - 12th place in midwifery. In 2003, Mr. Wilson Solis got the 6th place in ECE and in 2004, Engr. Jeffrey V. Esteve and Engr. Domingo S. Panton Jr. got the 18th and 19th place, respectively, in civil engineering. In May 16, 1997 to March 4, 1998, Dr. Lourdes G. Laniog assumed officer-in-charge of the college until her presidency in March 5, 1998 to May 31, 2002. Through the years, instruction, research and extension have been the focus of her leadership coupled with the hiring of additional teaching and non-teaching personnel, improvements of school facilities particularly, construction of covered court but collapsed during the typhoon Rosing, construction and completion of Multi Purpose Building, additional construction of covered walk, upgrading and restructuring of the Laboratory Shop Building, improvement of the water supply system, completion of the IT Building and rehabilitation of the Automotive and Machine Shop Building. Under her leadership, Secretary Raul Roco donated a 2-classroom building and the improvement of the AVR thru the fund assistance from Senator Magsaysay. The 3rd CSPC President, Dr. Monsito G. Ilarde, was appointed on May 27, 2002 but his formal assumption to the presidency was on July 1, 2002. Within the first month of his presidency, pursuant to the provision No. 2 of the CHED FY 2002 budget under the General Appropriation Act of FY 2000 or RA trades (BCAT) to Camarines Sur Polytechnic College (CSPC). Today, pursuant to CSPC board of Trustees resolution No. 00-044, the Former BCAT is now CSPC Naga Campus. A strong opposition to the integration of BCAT to CSPC is very evident to the BCAT Community because of their move for its conversion as a separate state college. Until now, CSPC Naga Campus community hopes that such move will still be reconsidered which the present leadership understand. For the moment this long standing dream has not been realized, the two campuses, Nabua and Naga, are doing its best in responding to the call for quality instruction and other mandated functions along research, extension and production. Significantly, Dr. Ilarde was able to mobilize developments for the college that paved the way for its strong commitment to provide professional and technological education for regional development. These are: accreditation of all its programs; produced board examination topnotchers as well as high percentage of board passers in almost all programs; compliance to EO 358 requirements of its non-degree programs; better students development programs and services; establishments and expansion of linkages; creation of the Buhi extension Campus with strong partnership with LGU Buhi; scholarship programs for faculty and students; physical development in support to the college primary goal in providing quality education. In May 3, 2011, Dr. Dulce Fajardo-Atian assumed as the 4th President of Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges. She envisions CSPC as the regional center of excellence in polytechnic education. As such continuing accreditations of all programs are in place and plans for opening of other curricular programs are considered to attain the goal of a university status. CSPC also embarks to be internationally recognized through its on-going endeavor for ISO accreditation. The challenge came on October 19, 2012 when the long-awaited dream of CSPC Naga campus came into reality. President Benigno S. Aquino III signed Republic Act No. 1110231 separating CSPC Naga Campus and converting it into Bicol State College of Applied Sciences and Technology (BISCAST).|$|R

30|$|Economics of {{education}} approaches {{in the tradition}} of human capital theory (Becker, [1964]) explain companies’ involvement in training in terms of investment in company-specific human capital and that investment’s positive returns. Specific human capital encompasses qualifications that can only be put to use in the company that provides the training. General human capital, in contrast, is transferable to other companies. As apprentice training in Germany, and in other countries such as Switzerland and Austria, is legally regulated to ensure that qualifications are transferrable beyond a particular company’s confines, it can be assumed {{that the majority of the}} qualifications imparted during apprentice training represents investment in Becker’s sense of general human capital. Companies would consequently view this type of investment as excessively risky because trainees would be more likely to leave or be lured away to other firms; therefore, these companies might be expected to recruit already-trained skilled workers from the external labour market. <b>In-company</b> <b>training</b> of skilled workers would then cease to be a worthwhile recruitment strategy.|$|E

In Italy, fashion {{has been one of the}} greatest experiments of modernity and one the most important events since the end of the World War II. In a few decades, it has grown in terms of identity, cultural impact, export volumes, and business, becoming a highly regarded aspect of the Italian culture. Modelled on the ‘Made in Italy’ label, ‘Learned in Italy’ focuses on the process of learning fashion, but, unlike the former, it has been the object of very little discussion and academic work. This paper presents some reflections under development at IUAV University of Venice on the peculiarities of learning fashion in the Italian context, taking into account academic-based experiences and <b>in-company</b> <b>training.</b> The perspective of ‘Learned in Italy’ makes it possible to explore immaterial aspects of fashion production, considering the human and relational factors of Made in Italy, from the local and regional scale...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{reflects}} on the growing demand for statistics training, in permanent education in general, and in just-in-time training with direct applicability in particular. It reports on work in short-course and in <b>in-company</b> <b>training</b> in statistics. Special attention is given to two cases, {{on the one hand}} a self-study course for a government department, on the other hand a system of highly interactive applets for visualization of statistical concepts related to the linear model. JUST-IN-TIME NETWORK-BASED LEARNING The existence of a growing demand for permanent education in general, and for just-intime on-the-job training with direct applicability to ongoing work in particular, cannot be denied. On the demand side are professionals with an academic degree or higher education. They are active in various socio-economic sectors like industry, government, finance and business, health sector or the educational domain; and they have various aims like updating or upgrading their knowledge, skills or competence. On the supply side, universities, private companies and mixed consortiums are the providers of formal and just-in-time education. Computer based training and/or e-learning (cd-rom and Internet) are becoming increasingly important as learning tools for just-in-time learning. Short focussed study module...|$|E
30|$|Cahuc et al. (2013) propose, for example, the {{implementation}} of effective activation measures similar to the German principle of “supporting and demanding” (Fördern und Fordern). Current structures and methods in France that are dedicated to support young people in difficulty are insufficient. The public employment service thus needs to be urgently given the means to take charge in a targeted and intensive manner for these young people. Next to establishing regular evaluations by independent experts examining the counterfactual situation (“What would {{have happened in the}} absence of the program or intervention?”) using modern scientific tools and methods, effective activation measures would include a monitoring program for young people without formal training, as well as a mandatory system of state-sponsored advice and counseling for young job seekers. In addition, a “youth guarantee” scheme should grant basic income support to the age group of 18 to 25 -year-olds while at the same time requiring job search efforts or participation in training programs. Moreover, the problem group of school dropouts should profit from a strengthening of existing <b>in-company</b> <b>training</b> programs. Cahuc et al. (2013) also recommend shifting employer training subsidies (e.g., exemptions from social security contributions or financial rewards for offering apprentices permanent employment) towards small and medium-sized enterprises.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Nowadays the {{formation}} of engineers requires more and more an active model well adapted to the necessities of the current global society. This premise is forcing universities to modify their traditional curricula in order to incorporate innovative aspects for {{the formation}}, so students can get an extra added value on their degree formation. As example, we can mention two cases currently in development {{in most of the}} universities of the European Union:?? Physical mobility {{on the basis of the}} international exchanges?? <b>In-company</b> <b>training</b> placements. These activities that have a benefit in {{the formation of}} the student, sometimes presents the problem of how to perform the evaluation in the evolution of the student's knowledge while they carry out these activities. In the case of international exchanges, it is easier, since the student incorporates to another university in which an evaluation model exists. However, in the case of in-company placements, it becomes more difficult to know the student's technical advance when he carries out a stay in a national or foreigner company. We are members of a group of European institutions (Università di Perugia (IT); TUCEP Consortium (IT); Universidad Politécnica de Valencia (E); University of Huddersfield (UK); Technological Educational Institution of Athens (GR)) that are working in the remote evaluation of in-company placements during the last two years. This work has been done under a projec...|$|E
