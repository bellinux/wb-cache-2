5|$|There was a {{football}} team operating in Tow Law as early as 1881, when a vicar captained the team. However, the club still playing today was founded as Tow Law in 1890. The club {{became one of the}} founding teams of the Auckland and District League in 1892, and won the Durham Amateur Cup the following year. They then joined the Northern League in 1894. In 1896 they won the Durham Challenge Cup. They left the Northern League, and played in the South Durham Alliance from 1900 to 1905. In 1905 the club changed its name to Tow Law Town which they have stuck with ever since. The club played <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crook</b> and District League from 1912 until 1914. After the end of World War I in 1918, the club again played in the Auckland and District League until 1920, when they returned to the Northern League where they have played ever since. The club were league winners two seasons in a row, in 1923–24 and 1924–25. They were runners up in 1928–29. In the Second World War they resigned from the Northern League on 20 March 1940 and their record of the season was deleted. They rejoined the league in 1945 on its resumption after the War.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Over {{the last}} decade, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) has {{documented}} a precipitous decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River redband trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) population, prompting {{this study to}} address potential factors contributing to the decline. There are two main goals to this project: (1) identify potential factors contributing to {{the reduction of the}} redband trout population <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River fishery and (2) provide management recommendations to all of the agencies responsible for managing <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River that might effect a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> redband trout population trend. This thesis had three objectives: (1) evaluate the movement patterns of redband trout and mountain whitefish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River below Bowman Dam, (2) monitor total dissolved gas levels (TDG) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River to evaluate the incidence of supersaturated water and gas bubble disease in redband trout and mountain whitefish and (3) implement a more comprehensive population estimate survey to document both redband trout and mountain whitefish population densities. Prior to this study, limited data existed on the distribution and movement patterns of redband trout and mountain whitefish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River below Bowman Dam. Based on the results from the 2 -year telemetry study, redband trout and mountain whitefish population exhibit a resident life history strategy and stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Wild and Scenic Section of <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River below Bowman Dam. Two potential explanations for the observed population decline were plausible: the decline was actually a decline, or the fish moved to other sections of <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River downstream of Bowman Dam. The telemetery study showed that redband trout and mountain whitefish stay within this section of river, thereby providing evidence against the explanation that the observed population decline was a result of movement of fish to other sections of river. The total dissolved gas study demonstrated that gas saturation levels become elevated enough to cause gas bubble disease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River below Bowman Dam. <b>The</b> gas saturation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River is equivalent or higher than levels shown to produce gas bubble disease (GBD) in fishes. When flows exceed 600 cfs, the total dissolved gas saturation exceeds the maximum Oregon Department of Environmental Quality mandated level of 110...|$|R

2500|$|History is an {{approximately}} 9-foot tall (274.32cm) {{statue of}} a female figure draped in Hellenistic robes, holding a feathered quill in her proper right hand and an open book cradled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> of her proper left arm. She wears a floor-length tunic with a wide, slightly pleated neckline underneath a loosely draped mantle which is approximately a foot shorter than the tunic itself. The mantle is draped over her proper left shoulder, encircles her body about the proper right hip, and is gathered at her proper left waist. Her proper right sleeve is rolled halfway up her arm above the elbow, and her proper right arm is crossed {{in front of her}} body, horizontal to her waist. She holds a feathered quill delicately in her proper right hand, and little finger of which is curled and raised slightly. The little finger of her proper left hand, which holds the open book, is also curled slightly, adding a sense of delicacy to her pose. Some of the pages of the book have been delineated from one another, in order to give it a more realistic appearance. Her hair is pulled back into a braid, and wound around itself several times, creating a thick bun. Her features have an idealized cast to them, and her eyes are lowered, gazing at the pages of the book in her proper left hand. The sculpture's proper right foot is raised slightly at the heel, and she stands with the majority of her weight on her proper left foot. This sculpture, like the other seven, is carved from Italian Carrara marble, and sits upon a cement pedestal. Approximately three feet below the base of the statue is a black plaque, upon which is the word [...] "HISTORY" [...] in gold lettering.|$|E

Emigration is an underlying theme in both novels though <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Florentines it is just temporarily experienced by the protagonist while coming of age. The Florentines, which represents an early and very original example of the campus novel tradition, belongs to the bildungsroman genre and its central theme is encounter: with England, English university life, English language...|$|R

'Here am I, good people, hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!' cried the waving hand. Then as the slit in the shawl widened Frank saw that behind the energetic fist there was a huge open mouth, a little button of a nose, and two eyes which were so resolutely screwed up that it seemed as if the owner had made a resolution never under any circumstances to take the least notice of this new world into which it had been transported.
