40|$|An {{advanced}} ozone {{membrane reactor}} that uses membranes for ozone distribution, reaction contact and selective water separation {{was used for}} ozone treatment of a recalcitrant <b>endocrine</b> <b>disrupting</b> <b>compound</b> in water. Experiments and model calculation were employed to examine the ozonation of phthalate in the new reactor. Experimental results showed that fast ozone mass transfer rate is responsible for membrane reactor's superb performance compared with a semibatch reactor. Selective water removal further enhanced phthalate conversion and TOC removal by concentrating the pollutants in the reaction zone. Clean water was produced by membrane separation. Mathematical model was used to investigate the effect of membranes, reactor design and reaction operation on pollutant conversion and removal. (c) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Bisphenol A (BPA), a pervasive, <b>endocrine</b> <b>disrupting</b> <b>compound</b> (EDC), {{acts as a}} mixed agonist- {{antagonist}} {{with respect}} to estrogens and other steroid hormones. We hypothesized that sexually selected traits would be particularly sensitive to EDC. Consistent with this concept, developmental exposure of males from the polygynous deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, to BPA resulted in compromised spatial navigational ability and exploratory behaviors, while there was little effect on females. Here, we have examined a related, monogamous species, the California mouse (Peromyscus californicus), where we predicted that males would be less sensitive to BPA in terms of navigational and exploratory behaviors, while displaying other traits related to interactions with females and territorial marking that might be vulnerable to disruption.

Twenty-two 60 -day-old male rats (F 0) received either a BPA diet (50 μg/kg/day) or vehicle alone for 10 weeks before being mated with non-exposed females.
