500|$|In 1963 Timmons' playing, with Lewis Powers on {{bass and}} Ron McCurdy on drums, was {{described}} by a Washington Post reviewer as [...] "flexible and adventuresome [...] Glossing over everything is an undeniable sheen of church music and spirituals." [...] In 1965 the same reviewer commented that Timmons was employing musicians who were of much lower ability: [...] "Timmons lacks a certain passion but I wonder {{if this is not}} the fault of his sidemen." [...] Timmons started playing vibes in the mid-1960s. He occasionally played organ, but recorded only one track on that instrument – a 1964 version of [...] "Moanin'" [...] on From the Bottom. Recordings as a leader continued, usually as part of a trio or quartet, but, after joining Milestone Records around 1967, Timmons' album <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>It!</b> featured him as part of a nonet, playing arrangements by Tom McIntosh.|$|E

Wood said he looked out his window at the red dirt on the then-undeveloped Moanalua Ridge and said, [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> as close to that color as you can because that's the color it will be when you're through." ...|$|E
2500|$|Further, Wilby {{submitted}} {{that the}} Council committed {{a criminal act}} when they allowed the movement of toxic waste without a licence: in 1986 there was no proper permission in place for moving the contaminated waste, only for moving 'inert' waste. Inspectors were not told {{the true nature of}} the substances involved and so took only sporadic samples from the site. Wilby said that the council had deliberately ignored the advice from experts to properly analyse the site because it was going to be an expensive task. He said: [...] "They decided they were going to do this 'dig-and-dump'. They thought 'we have got this great deal of land and all this spoil on this site which must be contaminated, we have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> off there because we'll never be able to sell it.'" [...] Records demonstrated that in one test which took place in 1983 only five soil samples were collected to represent a [...] area.|$|E

[...] "I {{remember}} Riel, and they'd have {{let him down}} again if he'd known enough not to aggravate them by killing that man at Fort Garry.

I can't {{get down to}} the book. I sit over it, and sit over it, but the confounded meadowlarks keep echoing in my ears, and I begin to see the fields, and the redwood canyons, and Selim. And after I waste an hour, I give up and ring for Selim. And if it isn't that, it's any one of a {{thousand}} other enchantments." ...|$|E

'I don't {{care for}} that,' Jacob said sturdily; 'if <b>it</b> has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> dirty <b>it</b> has <b>got</b> to; that ain't my fault; {{but it is}} my fault if it starts dirty.

25|$|Pile disliked {{school and}} thus {{received}} little education. He {{was put to}} work very young. His character was more practical than theoretical, trusting more to their eye than the plan.

Simpkins' boy; working his way through Stanford University, has elected the joy-ride path and is in jail waiting trial for forgery. Dick put his own lawyers on the case, smoothed it over, got the boy out on probation, and Simpkins' milk reports came back to par. And {{the best of it}} is, the boy made good, Dick kept an eye on him, saw him through the college of engineering, and he's now working for Dick on the dredging end, earning a hundred and fifty a month, married, with a future before him, and his father still milks." ...|$|E
