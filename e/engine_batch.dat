40|$|The {{computing}} {{and modeling}} environment of IIASA was {{studied in the}} context of computation-intensive ad resource-demanding applications/models which are being developed and used by the researchers/scientists of IIASA. High Performance Computing applicatins can be classified into two broad computing fields; sequential distributed and parallel distributed applications and these applications has been developed for heterogeneous operating system architectures such as Linux, Windows and Solaris etc. Majority of IIASA applications/models belong to the latter class of computing and these applications are resource demanding when the extensive and repetitive use of these applications is required according to the need of some research study. Not every sequential application can be easily parallelized; therefore, instead of re-programming sequental applications into parallel ones, the idea of distributing such applications on computing cluster/grid is often an effective approach for accelerating the work. In the light of available computing resources and modest modeling environment of IIASA, the virtualization and Sun Grid <b>Engine</b> (<b>batch</b> job scheduler and manager for cluster/grid) was efficiently exploited and designed, built and tested. This resulted in a computational cluster supporting multiple operating systems and multiple sequential distributed and parallel distributed applications/models along with multiple job execution types such as binaries and JAVA...|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to study the {{numerous}} contributors towards cyclic variations in combustion in a direct injection spark ignition engine, simultaneous high-speed imaging of fuel injection and flame growth are undertaken on a crank-angle resolved basis in a single-cylinder optical research <b>engine.</b> <b>Batches</b> of images from 100 consecutive cycles are acquired for all conditions with synchronised in-cylinder pressure logging. The engine is motored and fired at stoichiometric conditions at 1500 RPM under part-load and wide-open-throttle conditions (0. 5 - 1. 0 bar intake pressure), with injection timing set early in the intake stroke to promote homogeneous mixture formation with a centrally mounted multi-hole injector. Liquid impingement is observed on the cylinder walls and on the piston crown with early intake injection and multiple injection strategies are employed in {{an attempt to}} reduce impingement and alter mixture preparation and subsequent combustion. The effects are investigated for iso-octane and pump-grade gasoline at engine coolant temperatures of 50 and 90 °C. Gasoline sprays showed severe deformation and partial collapse of the individual spray plumes at 90 °C, leading to a different mixture formation process relative to iso-octane, which showed no such effects at this engine temperature. Using multiple fuel injections per cycle, but maintaining the same overall air-to-fuel ratio with single-injection strategies, a significant reduction in direct impingement on the walls was observed, together with different flame growth relative to single injection. These results suggest that injection strategy and type of fuel is playing {{an important role in the}} mixture preparation process, even for homogeneous early direct injection, and that different types of multiple-injection strategies alone have the potential to modify significantly in-cylinder phenomena, affect combustion and potentially exhaust emissions.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we discuss {{challenges}} of common bioinformatics applications when deployed outside their initial development environments. We propose a three-tiered approach to mitigate {{some of these issues}} by leveraging an encapsulation tool, a high-level workflow language, and a portable intermediary. As a case study, we apply this approach to refactor a custom EST analysis pipeline. The Starch tool encapsulates program dependencies to simplify task specification and deployment. The Weaver language provides abstractions for distributed computing and naturally encourages code modularity. The Makeflow workflow <b>engine</b> provides a <b>batch</b> system agnostic <b>engine</b> to execute compiled Weaver code. To illustrate the benefits of our framework, we compare implementations, show their performance, and discuss benefits derived from our new workflow approach relative to traditional bioinformatics development.

50|$|Export {{documents}} to Spain and Jane's (1936 ed.) reported it as a fighter, but Raab later {{described it as}} a trainer, which would be borne out by the low powered <b>engine</b> chosen. A <b>batch</b> of these aircraft, along with the Tigerschwalbe R-26V/33 (derived from an earlier Raab-Katzenstein model), were to be delivered to the Republican forces. Components of 30 aircraft were to be produced in Greece and shipped to Spain, where a subsidiary would carry out final assembly. An AEKKEA aircraft engineer, Georgios Pangakis, reported 40 (rather than 30) R-29s shipped to Spain, still missing engines and machine guns, which proved difficult to acquire. According to Raab, the Republicans gave roughly 60 incomplete airframes of both types, along with plans to the Soviets to be shipped back to the USSR.|$|R
50|$|Designed {{to meet a}} {{specification}} by the Imperial German Navy for a higher-powered {{replacement for}} the Sablatnig SF-2s then in service, the SF-5 was a very similar aircraft other than in its choice of <b>engine.</b> The first <b>batch</b> (serials 968-987) were delivered between January and May 1917, built in the Navy's HFT classification (unarmed reconnaissance aircraft equipped with wireless transmitter and receiver). They were followed by two further batches (1224-1233 and 1352-1371) between July and September. LVG built the type under licence as a trainer aircraft without any radio equipment, delivering 20 aircraft (1017-1036 and 1214-1223) {{during the second half}} of 1917. LFG produced the type in the BFT category (unarmed reconnaissance aircraft equipped with wireless transmitter but not receiver), building ten examples (1459-1468) between September 1917 and February 1918.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} marker-based position verification, using daily imaging and an off-line correction protocol, by calculating the delivered dose to prostate, rectum and bladder. Methods: Prostate cancer patients (n = 217) were treated with IMRT, receiving 35 daily fractions. Plans with five beams were optimized taking target coverage (CTV, boost) and organs-at-risk (rectum and bladder) into account. PTV margins were 8 mm. Prostate position was verified daily using implanted fiducial gold markers by imaging the first segment of all the five beams on an EPID. Setup deviations were corrected off-line using an adapted shrinking-action-level protocol. The estimated delivered dose, including daily organ movements, Was calculated using a version of PLATO's dose <b>engine,</b> enabling <b>batch</b> processing {{of large numbers of}} patients. The dose was calculated inclusion of setup corrections, and was evaluated relative to the original static plan. The marker-based measurements were considered representative for all organs. Results: Daily organ movements would result in an underdosage of 2 - 3 Gy to CTV and boost volume relative to the original plan, which was prevented by daily setup corrections. The dose to rectum and bladder was oil average unchanged, but a large spread was introduced by organ movements, which was reduced by including setup corrections. Conclusions: Without position verification and setup corrections, margins of 8 mm would be insufficient to account for position uncertainties during IMRT of prostate cancer. With the daily off-line correction protocol, the remaining variations are accommodated adequately. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

50|$|Curtiss and Porte's {{plans were}} {{interrupted}} by the outbreak of World War I. Porte sailed for England on 4 August 1914 and rejoined the Navy {{as a member of}} the Royal Naval Air Service. Appointed Squadron Commander of Royal Navy Air Station Hendon, he soon convinced the Admiralty of the potential of flying boats and was put in charge of the naval air station at Felixstowe in 1915. Porte persuaded the Admiralty to commandeer (and later, purchase) the America and a sister craft from Curtiss. This was followed by an order for 12 more similar aircraft, one Model H-2 and the remaining as Model H-4's. Four examples of the latter were assembled in the UK by Saunders. All of these were similar to the design of the America and, indeed, were all referred to as Americas in Royal Navy service. The engines, however, were changed from the under-powered 160 hp Curtiss engines to 250 hp Rolls-Royce Falcon <b>engines.</b> The initial <b>batch</b> was followed by an order for 50 more (totalling 64 Americas overall during the war). Porte also acquired permission to modify and experiment with the Curtiss aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|The Char B1 bis had a {{top speed}} of 25 km/h {{provided}} by a [...] petrol <b>engine.</b> The first <b>batch</b> of 35 Char B1 bis used the original engine but from 1938 to May 1940 they were slowly re-equipped. Its weight was about 31.5 metric tons. The operational range was about 180 km which was similar to other tanks of the period. At 20 km/h the three fuel tanks (total capacity of 400 L) would be exhausted in six hours. To improve matters, at first, trailers with an 800-litre auxiliary fuel tank were towed but this practice was soon abandoned. Instead Char B1 units included a large number of fuel trucks and TRC Lorraine 37 L armoured tracked refuelling vehicles specially designed to quickly refuel them. The last tanks to be produced in June had an extra internal 170 L fuel tank. To cool the more powerful engine the Char B1 bis had the air intake on the left side enlarged. It is often claimed this formed a weak spot in the armour, based on a single incident on 16 May near Stonne where two German 37 mm PAK guns claimed to have knocked out three Char B1's by firing at the intakes at close range. The air intake was a 6 in thick assembly of horizontal slits alternately angled upwards and downwards between 28 mm thick armour plates, and as such intended to be no more vulnerable than the normal 55 mm side plates.|$|R
40|$|Development of an {{apparatus}} capable of hosting combustion processes at volumetric compression ratios {{in excess of}} 100 : 1 and mean piston speeds of order 100 m/s has been successfully completed. Non-reacting gas compression tests indicate that the current piston/ring design is capable of achieving pressures as high as 90 % of their isentropic values (based on volume) with a repeatability of about 1 %. These values are more than adequate for a systematic investigation of combustion at extreme states. Two preliminary, light-load combustion tests have just been conducted using methanol and diesel as fuels. While these initial results are more symbolic than systematic, they indicate that our strategies for fuel injection, injection synchronization, and energy (work) extraction are also functioning correctly, {{and that we are}} well positioned to investigate the requirements for combustion under very high-speed, extreme compression conditions. In a parallel effort, we continue to investigate what is possible in the design space of ultra-high efficiency engines. While previous efforts focused on <b>batch</b> <b>engine</b> geometries (i. e., piston-cylinder), efforts during the past year have focused on understanding efficiency optimization for steady-flow (i. e., turbine) engines. Although similar in many respects, a key difference is the inability of these engines to provide reversible work interactions. Although still leading to a form of the same extreme-states principle that led to the experimental work cited above, this research shows that there exist intrinsic limitations on the state to which the working fluid may be compressed due to the inherent irreversibilities of the turbomachinery. Equally important, is that our preliminary assessment indicates that these states are well outside of the current engine operating envelope such that the possibility exists for significant improvement in the efficiency of steady flow combustion engines...|$|R
