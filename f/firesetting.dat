The <b>fireset</b> was located inside this flux compression experiment where large magnetic fields are generated. No energy sources were allowed inside the experiment and no wire connections can penetrate through the wall, of the experiment {{because of the high}} magnetic fields. The flux compression was achieved with high explosives in the experiment. The <b>fireset</b> was used to remotely charge a 1. 2 {micro}f capacitor to 6, 500 V and to provide a readout of the voltage on the capacitor at the control room. The capacitor was charged by using two 7 W fiber coupled GaAlAs laser diodes to illuminate two fiber coupled 12 V solar cells. The solar cell outputs were connected in parallel to the input of a DC-DC converter which step up a 12 V to 6, 500 V. A voltmeter, powered by illuminating a third 12 V solar cell with 1 W laser diode, was used to monitor the charge on the capacitor. The voltage was measured with a divider circuit, then converted to frequency in a V-F converter and transmitted to the control room over a fiber optic link. A fiducial circuit measured the capacitor firing current and provided an optical output timing pulse...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Firesetting</b> is {{the process}} of exposing a rock face to high {{temperatures}} to induce cracking, spalling, and an overall increase to the brittleness of the rock {{in order to make it}} more susceptible to mining processes. [...] Understanding the process of <b>firesetting</b> has been a crucial element to the development of an archaeological history of mining and as such has been the subject of several experiments to reproduce the technique. [...] Typically <b>firesetting</b> experiments are conducted by setting a fire next to a predetermined rock face while taking measurements on the amount of and type of fuel used, temperatures of the fire and rock face, the amount of spalling before and after excavation, as well as the amount of time required for the different procedures. [...] This examination allows for several possible inferences to be made about the mining process including the total amount of fuel a mining site may have needed to complete and its effects on the surrounding environment as well as how mining labor could have been organized. One outcome of <b>firesetting</b> experimentation is the realization that the quenching, or dousing the rock face with water after heating, is not necessary to making the rock face easier to excavate. [...] The quenching process had been a standard step in most experiments with <b>firesetting,</b> but now more research is necessary to answer the new question of why quenching was used if it was not effective.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{some authors}} {{continue}} {{to speculate that}} enuresis {{may be related to}} <b>firesetting</b> and animal cruelty in some way. One argument is that because persistent bed-wetting beyond the age of five can be humiliating for a child, especially {{if he or she is}} belittled by a parental figure or other adult as a result, this could cause the child to use <b>firesetting</b> or cruelty to animals as an outlet for his or her frustration. Enuresis is an [...] "unconscious, involuntary, and nonviolent act and therefore linking it to violent crime is more problematic than doing so with animal cruelty or firesetting".|$|E
40|$|High gain {{photoconductive}} semiconductor switches (PCSS) {{are being}} used to produce high power electromagnetic pulses foc (1) compact, repetitive accelerators, (2) ultra-wide band impulse sources, (3) precision gas switch triggers, (4) optically-activated <b>firesets,</b> and (5) high power optical pulse generation and control. High power, sub-nanosecond optical pulses are used for active optical sensors such as compact optical radars and range-gated hallistic imaging systems. Following a brief introduction to high gain PCSS and its general applications, this paper will focus on PCSS for optical pulse generation and control. PCSS technology can be employed in three distinct approaches to optical pulse generation and control: (1) short pulse carrier injection to induce gain-switching in semiconductor lasers, (2) electro-optical Q-switching, and (3) optically activated Q-switching. The most significant PCSS issues for these applications are switch rise time, jitter, and longevity. This paper will describe both the requirements of these applications and the most recent results from PCSS technology.

40|$|The {{velocity}} of short duration high-amplitude shock waves and high-speed motion created by {{sources such as}} explosives, high energy plasmas and other rapid-acceleration devices are difficult to measure due to their fast reaction times. One measurement tool frequently used is VISAR (Velocity Interferometer System for Any Reflector). VISAR is an optical-based system that utilizes Doppler interferometry techniques to measure the complete time-history of the motion of a surface. This technique is gaining worldwide acceptance as the tool of choice for measurement of shock phenomena. However, one limitation of the single point VISAR is that it measures only one point on a surface. The new Multi Point VISAR remedies the single point VISAR's limitation by using multiple fiber optics and sensors to send and receive information. Upcoming programs that need analysis of large diameter flyers prompted the concept and design of a single cavity-multiple fiber optic Multi Point VISAR (MPV). Preliminary designs and the testing of a single cavity prototype in 1996 supported the theory of compact fiber optic bundle systems for development into the Multi Point VISAR.

40|$|Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) is used {{throughout}} the stockpile as an energetic material. The formulation of PETN into XTX 8003 (80 % PETN, 20 % Sylgard 182) creates an extrudable energetic composite. PETN and XTX 8003 {{are used in the}} <b>firesets</b> for the retired W 68 (MC 2370) and the W 76 (MC 3028). When faced with potential lifetime extensions, energetic materials are naturally suspect regarding their output after prolonged aging. The authors have studied PETN and XTX 8003 by looking at 25 -year-old samples from retired MC 2370 s and newer materials. Both the old and new materials have also been placed in various accelerated aging protocols to investigate any decomposition that might occur over time. PETN is known to decompose autocatalytically even {{in the early stages of}} decomposition, but the process is poorly understood. Published values for the activation energy of decomposition vary by > 40 kcal/mol. The 12 million year half life predicted for room temperature PETN would be dramatically shortened by chemical influences that lead to lower energy decomposition pathways. Degree of confinement, purity, and crystal size all influence degradation rates. In this paper, the authors observe the effects of chemical and thermal aging on PETN. They anticipate changes in mechanism at higher temperature aging, and before trying to extrapolate to lower temperatures, they want to make sure that they understand the different chemical processed involved...|$|R

40|$|A Chemical-structure-based PolyUrethane Foam (CPUF) {{decomposition}} {{model has}} been developed to predict the fire-induced response of rigid, closed-cell polyurethane foam-filled systems. The model, developed for the B- 61 and W- 80 <b>fireset</b> foam, {{is based on a}} cascade of bondbreaking reactions that produce CO 2. Percolation theory is used to dynamically quantify polymer fragment populations of the thermally degrading foam. The partition between condensed-phase polymer fragments and gas-phase polymer fragments (i. e. vapor-liquid split) was determined using a vapor-liquid equilibrium model. The CPUF decomposition model was implemented into the finite element (FE) heat conduction codes COYOTE and CALORE, which support chemical kinetics and enclosure radiation. Elements were removed from the computational domain when the calculated solid mass fractions within the individual finite element decrease below a set criterion. Element removal, referred to as ?element death,? creates a radiation enclosure (assumed to be non-participating) as well as a decomposition front, which separates the condensed-phase encapsulant from the gas-filled enclosure. All of the chemistry parameters as well as thermophysical properties for the CPUF model were obtained from small-scale laboratory experiments. The CPUF model was evaluated by comparing predictions to measurements. The validation experiments included several thermogravimetric experiments at pressures ranging from ambient pressure to 30 bars. Larger, component-scale experiments were also used to validate the foam response model. The effects of heat flux, bulk density, orientation, embedded components, confinement and pressure were measured and compared to model predictions. Uncertainties in the model results were evaluated using a mean value approach. The measured mass loss in the TGA experiments and the measured location of the decomposition front were within the 95 % prediction limit determined using the CPUF model for all of the experiments where the decomposition gases were vented sufficiently. The CPUF model results were not as good for the partially confined radiant heat experiments where the vent area was regulated to maintain pressure. Liquefaction and flow effects, which are not considered in the CPUF model, become important when the decomposition gases are confined...|$|R

Basically they used the thermic alteration or <b>firesetting</b> (Mohen 1992, Craddock 1995, Eiroa et al. 1996, Timberlake 2003). This consists of applying fire to the rock and then pouring water over it: the rapid changes of temperature will cause cracks within the rocks that can be totally broken with the help of mauls and picks. Then the useful masses were selected, crushed and transported to the production centre that could be in the surrounding area (Mitterberg) or far away (Rudna Glava).|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Firesetters have {{traditionally}} been considered dangerous repeat offenders. However, the specific risk factors associated with <b>firesetting</b> recidivism have not been consistently tested in representative samples. It is also unclear whether individuals whose offending is limited to <b>firesetting</b> {{are at increased risk}} of reoffending when compared with firesetters who have more versatile offending. This study aimed to: (1) determine the rate of <b>firesetting</b> recidivism in a representative sample of firesetters before the courts; and (2) determine the psychiatric and criminogenic factors that are related to <b>firesetting</b> recidivism. Methods: The study employed a data linkage approach to examine the psychiatric and criminal histories of 1052 firesetters convicted of arson between 2000 and 2009 in Victoria, Australia. The characteristics of those who reoffended, over a follow-up period of 2. 5 - 11 years, by committing arson and arson-related offences were compared with those who went on to reoffend in other ways but not arson. An improper model was used to determine which of the tested variables could meaningfully predict <b>firesetting</b> recidivism. Results: The rate of <b>firesetting</b> recidivism, based on charges, was very low (5. 3 %) compared with the rate of general recidivism (55. 4 %); the vast majority of <b>firesetting</b> recidivists were mixed (criminally versatile) offenders (91 %). The study found that general criminality, <b>firesetting</b> history, and psychiatric disorder were associated with <b>firesetting</b> recidivism.
