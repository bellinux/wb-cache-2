40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new method for <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>precursors,</b> here diluted phosphoric acid, on silicon wafers {{for the purpose of}} inline diffusion. The method {{consists}} of a surface preparation step to enhance wettability followed by the actual coating step. Coating is carried out by rolling the precursor onto the wafers with a set of sponge rollers. This approach results in homogenous deposition of thin precursor layers without the need for adding surfactants or organic solvents. We demonstrate that the novel precursor deposition method, in conjunction with an appropriate diffusion process, is suitable for preparation of very homogeneous emitters exhibiting depth profiles similar to POCl 3 emitters. Cell efficiency of first processed multi-crystalline solar cells was 15. 2 % in average and 15. 6 % for the best cell...|$|E
40|$|Nanocomposites are of {{interest}} for numerous applications such as catalysis, photonic band gap materials, and waveguides. Ionomers and diblock copolymers have previously been used as templates for ordered nanocomposites. However, these processes have been limited to reactions within thin films or coprecipitation methods from solution due to mass transport limitations of ceramic and metallic precursors within the solid templates. This issue has been addressed by fabricating ordered nanocomposites using phase selective <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>precursors</b> into supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) swollen polymeric templates. SCCO 2 is an effective plasticizing agent for most polymers and enhances mass transport of the precursors into polymeric templates while preserving the initial template morphology. By proper choice of template material, the precursor can be selectively bound within one phase of the template and reacted to produce the desired material. The resulting composite contains nanoparticles arranged in an ordered morphology dictated by the template over bulk dimensions. Polymer/ceramic and polymer/metal nanocomposites have been successfully synthesized using this technique. ...|$|E

Galvanostatic measurements show a volumetric capacity (415 mAh·cm− 3) of the deposited electrode material. In addition, electrochemical activity was shown for half-cells, created by coating WO 3 with LLT as the solid-state electrolyte. The electron blocking properties of the LLT solid-electrolyte was shown by ferrocene reduction. 3 D depositions were done on various micro-sized Si template structures, showing fully covering coatings of both WO 3 and LLT. Finally, the thermal budget required for WO 3 layer deposition was minimized, which enabled attaining active WO 3 on 3 D TiN/Si micro-cylinders.

3000|$|Based on the {{characterization}} of morphologies, structures, and composition, the CNNC growth can be outlined as the catalyst-leading growth mode. In this mode, the nickel catalyst layer first melts and fragments into separated hemisphere-like islands under heating of the abnormal glow discharge plasma over the substrate. Then, the incipient CNNCs are formed on the nickel islands due to the <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>precursors</b> such as CN species, nitrogen atoms, and C 2 species from the discharge plasma [17]. As the CN radicals and other reactive species continue to attach, the heights and lateral diameters of the CNNCs increase simultaneously. Meanwhile, the enclosed molten nickel will be sucked {{to the top and}} leave the narrow pipelines {{in the center of the}} cone bodies by the capillary effect. The catalyst nickel on the tops will lead to the growth of the CNNCs. As the CNNCs increase in height, the ion streams accelerated by a voltage of 350  eV will be focused on the tops by a locally enhanced electric field. The intense ion streams will sputter off the attached species and cut down the diameters of the tops [18]. In this way, the intact CNNC arrays with central pipelines and sharp tips eventually finish the growth. Because the precursors are mainly composed of CN species, nitrogen atoms, and C 2 species [17], the bodies of the as-grown CNNCs are mainly amorphous CN [...]...|$|E

XRD analysis, BET surface area results and H 2 TPR measurements have all revealed the presence of significant interaction between the perovskite and the alumina based support, which becomes very strong upon thermal treatment at 1100 °C. On the other hand, MgO supported samples undergo only sintering processes with reduction of surface area upon treatment at 1100 °C. Catalytic activity measurements in methane combustion have been performed both in fixed bed and in monolithic reactor. The results on powders {{have shown that the}} dispersion on both supports is effective to enhance the catalytic performances of the catalysts treated at 800 °C. A very strong deactivation is observed for the La/Al 2 O 3 supported catalyst when pre-treated at 1100 C, while LaMnO 3 /MgO shows a promising high thermal stability. The chemical nature of the active sites changes by dispersing LaMnO 3 on both supports, even if to a different extent, as revealed by the estimated values of apparent activation energy and reaction orders for methane and oxygen. Structured combustion catalysts have been prepared following well established procedures towashcoat commercial cordierite monoliths with lanthanum stabilised alumina. The subsequent <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>precursors</b> on the coated monolith has been obtained by deposition precipitation method. Comparison between monolith and corresponding powder sample shows a higher catalytic activity of the former, likely to be attributed to the better dispersion obtained with repeated deposition cycles of active phase on the thin washcoat layer.

In this work, CZTS thin films were grown using two different processes, based on vacuum <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>precursors,</b> followed by a heat treatment in sulphur atmosphere. The precursors were deposited using two different approaches: (i) electron-beam evaporation of multiple stacks made of ZnS, Sn and Cu and (ii) co-sputtering deposition of the three binary sulphides CuS, SnS and ZnS. All the materials were characterized both as isolated films and as absorber layer in solar cells, produced using the typical structure Mo/CZTS/CdS/i:Zno/AZO. Both growth processes were found to give good quality kesterite films, showing CZTS as the main phase, large grains and suitable properties for PV application, but higher homogeneity and stoichiometry control were achieved using the co-sputtering route. A detailed investigation on CZTS optical properties, microstructure, intrinsic defect density and their correlation with the material composition is presented. A strong effect of the tin content on the bandgap energy, sub-gap absorption coefficient, crystalline domain and grain size is shown and a model based on the increase of the intrinsic defect density induced by a reduced tin content is proposed. These studies suggested a correlation between the increase of the bandgap energy and the improvement of the material quality, which was also confirmed by the performances of the final devices. CZTS thin films were then assembled into the solar cells and their properties as absorber layer were optimized by varying both composition and thickness.

The results concerning the upper part of the transition, where the first sign change occurs, are discussed in terms of the renormalized fluctuation model for the Hall conductivity, adapted through the field rescaling procedure in order to take into account the arbitrary orientation of the magnetic field.

The basic processing approach involves first synthesizing a powder containing the oxides of copper, indium and gallium.

Among all growth technique, the bottom-up vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) nanowire (NW) fabrication technique offers the ability to encode material functionalities along the length of a NW in a user programmable manner. A robust control of VLS growth requires understanding of multiple heterogeneous chemical processes: (1) transportation of semiconductor molecules/atoms from vapor to liquid droplets or vice versa at the vapor-liquid (VL) interface, (2) crystallization and dissolution of semiconductor atoms at the liquid-solid (LS) interface, and (3) the conformal <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>precursor</b> molecules onto the nanowire sidewall at the vapor-solid (VS) interface.
