50|$|In 1999, {{these were}} the first retail {{brokerage}} accounts where every communication and business process was conducted electronically. New account applications, account approvals, monthly customer statements and trade confirmations were all processed over the internet and/or sent electronically. ShareBuilder’s automatic investing system was the first commercial program that employed an in-house share accounting system that accepted customer orders for any stock or exchange-traded fund (ETF) on a dollar-denominated basis, instead of specified share amounts. This enabled the investor to set a pre-determined dollar amount for monthly investing and accumulate both whole and fractional shares of stock as the program executed. Most importantly, this form of investing is based on aggregating customer orders across all stocks being bought, enabling the trade cost to be spread across a multitude of buyers and allowing efficient order execution for even small orders. For example, a customer investing only $50 each in Google and Microsoft every month would have their order grouped with thousands of dollars' worth of other orders, enabling better order execution, <b>fractional</b> <b>share</b> purchases and a commission as low as $1 per transaction.|$|E
40|$|The law and {{economics}} literature on multiple causation generally distinguishes between causal uncertainty and joint causation. For cases of causal uncertainty {{it has been shown}} that proportional liability, a <b>fractional</b> <b>share</b> rule, may lead to socially optimal incentives for the level of care. However, for cases of joint causation <b>fractional</b> <b>share</b> rules tend to be inefficient. This paper argues that the crucial distinction is not so much between the uncertainty or jointness of the causal elements, but rather between the additivity or non-additivity of risk factors. We develop an approach that integrates causal uncertainty and joint causation. We show that an apportionment rule that assigns liability in proportion to the probability of causation always yields efficient incentives when the risk factors are additive. In non-additive cases the proportional rule has an efficient equilibrium outcome (and this equilibrium is unique for almost all parameter settings) when tortfeasors act independently and simultaneously. But it is not always efficient when tortfeasors act in concert or act sequentially. We apply our approach to four recent cases from English jurisprudence. These cases illustrate that both causal uncertainty and joint causation may involve additive as well as non-additive risks. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{revocable}} {{trust is}} a popular estate planning tool used to disinherit a spouse in sixteen jurisdictions. In common law jurisdictions, a surviving spouse, who is dissatisfied {{with his or her}} inheritance, has the right to receive an elective share of the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s estate regardless of the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s estate plan. However, sixteen jurisdictions have defined a dissatisfied spouse 2 ̆ 7 s rights with a <b>fractional</b> <b>share</b> of the deceased spouse 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 net probate estate, 2 ̆ 2 allowing one spouse to disinherit the other, by single-handedly transferring his or her assets to a revocable trust. To add insult to injury seven of these common law jurisdictions have recently codified trust law making it seamless for the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s creditor to be paid from revocable trust assets. The elective share is one of few limitations imposed on testamentary freedom. Common law property jurisdictions have created a public policybased statute for married persons that prohibit the first-to-die spouse from disinheriting his or her surviving spouse. To avoid disinheritance, common law jurisdictions statutorily protect a surviving spouse (spouse) with an elective share. The elective share arose {{in the early nineteenth century}} as a replacement of dower and curtesy rights. At that time the nature of wealth shifting from real to personal property made dower and curtesy obsolete. The elective share protected the spouse from disinheritance by guaranteeing him or her with a <b>fractional</b> <b>share</b> of the deceased spouse 2 ̆ 7 s net probate estate, a method known as the traditional elective share. 2 ̆ 7 However, like the shift from real to personal property there has been a subsequent shift in wealth from probate to non-probate assets (like revocable trusts) making the traditional elective share equally obsolete and inadequate to protect a spouse from disinheritance...|$|E

40|$|The {{effective}} {{number of}} parties, N = 1 /Σp(i) 2 (where p(i) is the <b>fractional</b> <b>share</b> of the ith party), usually suffices to describe adequately {{a constellation of}} parties of different strengths.

In such cases N(∞) = 1 /p 1 is proposed as a supplementary indicator: a value less than 2 indicates absolute dominance. An 'NP' index proposed earlier {{is a combination of}} N and N(∞); its values are close of those of N(∞), but NP sometimes falls below 2 even when many parties are relevant for coalition formation.

We establish a connection between the multiplication operation on trees and the theory of word equations, allowing us to derive the decidability of its existential theory and the undecidability of its full first-order theory. We prove that the full first-order theory over the model with both the Boolean operations and the restricted multiplication operation (with constants on the right hand side) is decidable via an embedding to tree-automatic structures...|$|E

40|$|We {{find that}} {{strategic}} sequencing {{and other factors}} sort parties roughly into two groups. Low-ranking parties lose part of their inherent support, compared to probabilistic expectations, while high-ranking parties profit from the shift. Our method is to graph the worldwide mean seat shares of parties at various ranks by size against the largest party share (Nagayama triangle format). The resulting empirical pattern looks complex, yet when we adjust a probabilistic model to account for strategic and other factors that may hurt the smaller parties, the fit becomes close. The number of parties that profit from transfers {{is close to the}} inverse of the <b>fractional</b> <b>share</b> of the largest party. The model fits best when the transfer is assumed to involve about one-half of inherent minor party support. This is a novel way to estimate the universal average strength of strategic and other factors that work against the smaller parties.

40|$|International audienceScientific workloads {{are often}} {{described}} by directed acyclic task graphs. This is {{in particular the}} case for multifrontal factorization of sparse matrices —the focus of this paper— whose task graph is struc-tured as a tree of parallel tasks. Prasanna and Musicus advocated using the concept of malleable tasks to model parallel tasks involved in matrix computations. In this powerful model each task is processed on a time-varying number of processors. Following Prasanna and Musicus, we consider malleable tasks whose speedup is p α, where p is the <b>fractional</b> <b>share</b> of processors on which a task executes, and α (0 < α ≤ 1) is a task-independent parameter. Firstly, we use actual experiments on mul-ticore platforms to motivate the relevance of this model for our application. Then, we study the optimal time-minimizing allocation proposed by Prasanna and Musicus using optimal control theory. We greatly simplify their proofs by resorting only to pure scheduling arguments. Building on the insight gained thanks to these new proofs, we extend the study to distributed (homogeneous or heterogeneous) multicore platforms. We prove the NP-completeness of the corresponding scheduling problem, and we then propose some approximation algorithms...|$|E

40|$|For {{parties of}} unequal seat shares (s i), the widely used {{effective}} number of parties (N = 1 /Σs i 2) offers an equivalent in equal-sized parties, {{but it needs}} a supplement to express the imbalance in actual shares. This is akin to supplementing the mean with the standard deviation. A suitable 'index of balance' is b = -log s 1 /log p, where S 1 is the largest share and p {{is the number of}} seat-winning parties. It can range from 0 (utter imbalance) to 1 (perfect equality of all parties). In most individual countries, the median balance is between 0. 4 and 0. 6, and the worldwide median balance is close to 0. 50 for any number of seat-winning parties except 2, in line with a simple logical model. Independent of electoral systems used, a rule of conservation emerges: the median product of the largest party's <b>fractional</b> <b>share</b> and the square root of the number of seat-winning parties is conserved: s 1 p 0. 5 = 1.
