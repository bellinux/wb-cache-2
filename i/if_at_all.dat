5|$|The ancient Sussex {{fishing village}} of Brighthelmston, {{which in the}} 18th and 19th centuries {{developed}} into the fashionable seaside resort of Brighton, lay within the Anglican Diocese of Chichester. In the 19th century, before the Elementary Education Act 1870 centralised the provision of primary-level education and established school boards, most 5- to 12-year-olds were taught (<b>if</b> <b>at</b> <b>all)</b> at schools founded and sponsored by charities, private benefactors or churches. There were many such church schools in Brighton: Anglican churches with their own schools included Christ Church, St Bartholomew's, St John the Evangelist's, St Mark's, St Martin's, St Paul's and St Stephen's.|$|E
5|$|The new {{brigadier general}} {{was placed in}} command of the Albany post, serving under Major General Jeffery Amherst. In 1759, shortly after {{capturing}} Ticonderoga without a fight, General Amherst learned of the death of General John Prideaux whose expedition had captured Fort Niagara. Amherst then ordered Gage to take Prideaux's place, and to take Fort de La Présentation (also known as Fort La Galette) {{at the mouth of the}} Oswegatchie River on Lake Ontario. When Amherst learned that the French had also abandoned Fort St. Frédéric, he sent a messenger after Gage with more explicit instructions to capture La Galette and then, <b>if</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> possible, to advance on Montreal.|$|E

5|$|The {{privileges}} {{have been}} lost and eroded over time. Only three survived into the 20th century: {{the right to be}} tried by other peers of the realm instead of juries of commoners, freedom from arrest in civil (but not criminal) cases, and access to the Sovereign to advise him or her on matters of state. The right to be tried by other peers was abolished in 1948. Legal opinion considers the right of freedom from arrest as extremely limited in application, <b>if</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> The remaining privilege is not exercised and was recommended for formal abolition in 1999, but has never been formally revoked.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{right whale}} spends the summer months in the far Southern Ocean feeding, probably close to Antarctica. It migrates north in winter for breeding, and can be seen around the coasts of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Mozambique, New Zealand, South Africa and Uruguay. Since hunting of the {{southern right whale}} ceased, stocks are estimated to have grown by 7% a year. The South American, South African and Australasian groups apparently intermix very little, <b>if</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> because of the strong fidelity of mothers to their feeding and calving grounds. The mother passes these instincts to her calves.|$|E

5|$|Although the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech, only a {{relatively}} small subset of these {{will be used to}} transcribe any one language. It is possible to transcribe speech with various levels of precision. A precise phonetic transcription, in which sounds are described in a great deal of detail, is known as a narrow transcription. A coarser transcription which ignores some of this detail is called a broad transcription. Both are relative terms, and both are generally enclosed in square brackets. Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details, or only to details that are relevant to the discussion at hand, and may differ little <b>if</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> from phonemic transcriptions, but they make no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed are necessarily meaningful in the language.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{tracks are}} rare and no burrows under the sea-floor {{have so far}} {{been found in the}} Burgess Shale. These {{absences}} have been used to support the idea that the water near the sea-floor was anoxic. However {{it is possible that the}} water just above the sea-floor was oxygenated while the water in the sediment below it was anoxic, and also possible that there simply were no deep-burrowing animals in the Burgess Shale. Some fossils, such as Marrella, are almost always the right way up, which suggests they were not transported far <b>if</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Others, such as Wiwaxia, are often at odd angles, and some fossils of animals with shelly or toughened components very rarely contain remains of soft tissues. This suggests that the distances over which corpses were transported may have varied between genera, although most were buried where they had lived.|$|E

5|$|Homozygous FH {{is harder}} to treat. The LDL receptors are {{minimally}} functional, <b>if</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Only high doses of statins, often {{in combination with other}} medications, are modestly effective in improving lipid levels. If medical therapy is not successful at reducing cholesterol levels, LDL apheresis may be used; this filters LDL from the bloodstream in a process reminiscent of dialysis. Very severe cases may be considered for a liver transplant; this provides a liver with normally functional LDL receptors, and leads to rapid improvement of the cholesterol levels, but at the risk of complications from any solid organ transplant (such as rejection, infections, or side-effects of the medication required to suppress rejection). Other surgical techniques include partial ileal bypass surgery, in which part of the small bowel is bypassed to decrease the absorption of nutrients and hence cholesterol, and portacaval shunt surgery, in which the portal vein is connected to the vena cava to allow blood with nutrients from the intestine to bypass the liver.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{sketches}} and songs were {{cast by the}} production team, sometimes acting on input from the show's stable of performers themselves. While certain roles naturally lent themselves to a particular actor, Norris said that confidence in the entire cast's ability was such that the producers also experimented with casting against type. The demands of filming thirteen episodes' worth of material in the same timeframe as a standard six-episode sketch show, while coping with the many complex makeup and wardrobe changes required, resulted in casting also being partially dependent on the logistics of moving a performer from one character to another. Recurring characters were <b>if</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> possible played by the actor who had originated the part, leading {{to the development of}} several signature roles, as for example Baynton's Charles II, Jim Howick's Shouty Man, Rickard's Bob Hale, Willbond's Henry VIII, Martha Howe-Douglas' Elizabeth I and Simon Farnaby's Death.|$|E
5|$|Iodous {{acid and}} iodite are even less stable and exist {{only as a}} {{fleeting}} intermediate in the oxidation of iodide to iodate, <b>if</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Iodates {{are by far the}} most important of these compounds, which can be made by oxidising alkali metal iodides with oxygen at 600°C and high pressure, or by oxidising iodine with chlorates. Unlike chlorates, which disproportionate very slowly to form chloride and perchlorate, iodates are stable to disproportionation in both acidic and alkaline solutions. From these, salts of most metals can be obtained. Iodic acid is most easily made by oxidation of an aqueous iodine suspension by electrolysis or fuming nitric acid. Iodate has the weakest oxidising power of the halates, but reacts the quickest.|$|E

5|$|The {{first thing}} {{he had to do}} was {{determine}} the characteristics of the aircraft that would be used. There were only two Allied aircraft large enough: the British Avro Lancaster and the US Boeing B-29 Superfortress. The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) wanted to use the B-29 <b>if</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> possible, even though it required substantial modification. Ramsey supervised the test drop program, which began at Dahlgren, Virginia, in August 1943, before moving to Muroc Dry Lake, California, in March 1944. Mock ups of Thin Man and Fat Man bombs were dropped and tracked by an SCR-584 ground based radar set of the kind that Ramsey had helped develop at the Radiation laboratory. Numerous problems were discovered with the bombs and the aircraft modifications, and corrected.|$|E
5|$|The most {{characteristic}} initial {{physical symptoms}} are jerky, random, and uncontrollable movements called chorea. Chorea may be initially exhibited as general restlessness, small unintentionally initiated or uncompleted motions, lack of coordination, or slowed saccadic eye movements. These minor motor abnormalities usually precede more obvious signs of motor dysfunction {{by at least}} three years. The clear appearance of symptoms such as rigidity, writhing motions or abnormal posturing appear as the disorder progresses. These are signs that the system in the brain {{that is responsible for}} movement has been affected. Psychomotor functions become increasingly impaired, such that any action that requires muscle control is affected. Common consequences are physical instability, abnormal facial expression, and difficulties chewing, swallowing, and speaking. Eating difficulties commonly cause weight loss and may lead to malnutrition. Sleep disturbances are also associated symptoms. Juvenile HD differs from these symptoms in that it generally progresses faster and chorea is exhibited briefly, <b>if</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> with rigidity being the dominant symptom. Seizures are also a common symptom of this form of HD.|$|E
