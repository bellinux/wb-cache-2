40|$|In this study, {{one-dimensional}} {{analysis using}} AVL Boost software {{has been carried}} out on a series of compression and spark ignition engines utilizing a manufacturer fitted single-entry turbocharger and a modified twin-entry unit, the latter adopting two symmetrical turbine <b>housing</b> <b>inlet</b> ports. The model reconstruction using AVL Boost considers parameters that accurately represent the physical engine conditions including manifold geometry, turbocharger flow maps and combustion chamber characteristics. Model validations have been made for a standard single-entry turbocharger configuration to predict the maximum engine power and torque, in comparison with available manufacturer data and analytical calculations. Further studies concentrate on engine performance comparisons between single- and twin-entry turbochargers at low engine speed conditions, typically in a range of 1000 â€“ 3000 RPM. Improvements in turbine shaft speed, engine power and torque have been achieved, thus implying improved low speed engine response. This study reveals the potential commercial benefits of adopting a twin-entry turbocharger and contribution to the academic community through this additional research...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis was to demonstrate the concept of generating electrical energy using only compressed air as a working fluid. Compressed air systems are common on naval installations, posing an enticing opportunity for small-scale electrical generation. The use of a small turbine, {{in this case a}} turbocharger, provided a constant source of shaft power which was used to spin a small permanent magnet motor. With the permanent magnet motor generating alternating current (AC) voltage, a bridge rectifier integrated circuit (IC) was used to rectify the voltage to direct current (DC). The electricity generated was then stored in a 16 -volt supercapacitor. While testing the system, it was discovered that more shaft power could be produced if atmospheric air was entrained into the turbine <b>housing</b> <b>inlet.</b> The effect was similar to an ejector, which is commonly used on aircraft engines to increase thrust. This research demonstrated the feasibility of combining commercially available components to harness compressed air in order to generate electricity on a small scale. This system could be utilized to offset power spikes associated with heavy equipment startup, or as an always-on emergency backup system for critical components. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|E

40|$|An <b>inlet</b> <b>housing</b> for a partial-admission turbine {{has been}} {{designed}} to cause the inlet airflow to make a smooth transition from an open circular inlet to an inlet slot. The smooth flow is required for purposes of measuring inlet flow characteristics and maximizing the efficiency of the turbine. A partial-admission turbine is a turbine in which the inlet slot occupies less than a complete circle around the rotor axis. In this case, the inlet slot occupies a 90 arc. The present special inlet-housing design is needed because the "bull nose" shape of a conventional turbine <b>inlet</b> <b>housing</b> fails to provide the required smooth transition in a partial-admission configuration and thereby gives rise to a loss of turbine efficiency and inaccuracies in inlet flow measurements. Upon entering the <b>inlet</b> <b>housing</b> through the circular opening, the flow encounters a "tongue"-shaped passageway, which serves as a ramp that diverts the flow to the first of two straight passages. This first passageway occupies a 90 arc and has a length equal to two passage heights. Instrumentation rakes for measuring the characteristics of the inlet flow are installed in this passageway. Just past the first straight passageway is the second one, which is narrower and leads to the 90 turbine inlet slot. This passageway is used to smooth the flow immediately prior to its passage through the turbine inlet slot. The length of this second passageway equals the length of the chord of a turbine vane. The <b>inlet</b> <b>housing</b> incorporates small ports for measuring static pressures at various locations of the flow, and incorporates bosses for the installation of the instrumentation rakes. The <b>inlet</b> <b>housing</b> also includes a flange at its inlet end for attachment to a circular inlet duct and a flange at its outlet end for attachment to the outer casing of the turbine...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Mobile agents {{performing}} dynamic sensing without {{control on}} information acquisition rely on arbitrarily distributed information. The integration of irrelevant, ambiguous or misleading evidence {{may result in}} poor classification performance. In contrast, active fusion schemes seek to acquire evidence that is most appropriate to the current task, e. g., to disambiguate {{the current state of}} belief. This paper understands the fusion process in visual object detection as a sequential decision problem. Reinforcement learning enables to develop an efficient strategy to fuse decisive information in terms of a sensorimotor mapping. The presented system learns object models from visual appearance and uses a connectionist architecture for a probabilistic interpretation of the 2 -D views. The expected gain in the global classification accuracy provides a utility measure to reinforce actions leading to discriminative viewpoints. The system is verified in experiments with a sewer robot on the task of visually detecting <b>house</b> <b>inlets</b> in sewage pipes for navigation purposes. Crucial improvements in performance are gained using the learned fusion strategy in contrast to arbitrary action selections. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{hydraulically}} operated pump is described for in-ground filtering and monitoring of wells or other fluid sources, including a hollow cylindrical pump <b>housing</b> with an <b>inlet</b> and an outlet, filtering devices positioned in the inlet and the outlet, a piston that fits slidably within the pump housing, and an optical cell {{in fluid communication}} with the pump housing. A conduit within the piston allows fluid communication between the exterior and {{one end of the}} piston. A pair of O-rings form a seal between the inside of the pump housing and the exterior of the piston. A flow valve positioned within the piston inside the conduit allows fluid to flow in a single direction. In operation, fluid enters the pump <b>housing</b> through the <b>inlet,</b> flows through the conduit and towards an end of the pump housing. The piston then makes a downward stroke closing the valve, thus forcing the fluid out from the pump housing into the optical cell, which then takes spectrophotometric measurements of the fluid. A spring helps return the piston back to its starting position, so that a new supply of fluid may enter the pump housing and the downward stroke can begin again.
