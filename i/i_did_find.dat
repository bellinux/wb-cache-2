That doesn't mean that there's no gun use, so <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>find</b> it really interesting. For me, the thing is, it blew me away that members of [...] Parliament were speaking about this. One, because it's a music video, and two, because don't you guys have television shows out there that show crime? It's really strange to me. I don't understand why pop stars are put on such a high pedestal over other celebrities. Why do members of Parliament feel that they need to scrutinize her for having a gun, and 'She's in the public,' and 'She should know better,' and 'She's a role model,' but what about every other celebrity out there? What about every other actor? That's very strange to me. I was really surprised at how much the gun use was scrutinized. [...] a professional criminal, so it makes sense he has a gun. We shouldn't censor ourselves." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's funny!" [...] growled the Hip-po-gy-raf; [...] "I {{can smell}} straw, but I can't find it. Well, it's here, somewhere, and I must hunt around until <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>find</b> it, for I'm hungry." ...|$|R
60|$|Object. But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>find</b> many {{weaknesses}} in every duty that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> perform, as when I pray, when I read, when I hear, {{or any other}} duty, that it maketh me out of conceit with myself, it maketh me think that my duties are nothing worth.|$|R

6000|$|... "He did say something," [...] {{admitted}} the other, [...] "the first time I saw him. And, by-the-bye, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>find</b> {{him in the}} garden. The thump {{on the back of}} his head had made him a little incoherent then. Afterwards he was rather reticent than otherwise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And so it was, {{instead of}} in paradise, that I found myself in the arid desert of commercialism. I found nothing but stupidity, except for business. I found none clean, noble, and alive, though I found many who were alive--with rottenness. What <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>find</b> was monstrous {{selfishness}} and heartlessness, and a gross, gluttonous, practised, and practical materialism." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{shall not}} need to make any great ado in opening the words at this time, but shall rather lay down one {{doctrine}} that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>find</b> in them; and in prosecuting that, I shall show you, in some measure, {{the scope of the}} words.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I am {{worse off}} now than I was before. I thought I was earning your forgiveness, {{but if it}} is my own, I can't be lenient; it would not become me. Now what can <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> <b>Find</b> me some way out of this with your wise little head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and my femur of a rabbit," [...] said Armine, [...] "and {{said it was}} a nasty old bone, and the baker's Pincher ate it up; but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>find</b> my turtle-dove's egg in the ash-heap, and {{discovered}} it over again, and you don't see it is broken now; it is stuck down on a card." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Absolutely nothing," [...] I declared. [...] "Stop, though. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>find</b> out this. There is {{some secret}} about the child's parentage. I {{have spoken with}} two people who know it, {{and one of them}} warned me that in keeping the child we were interfering in a greater matter than we had any idea of. Of course {{it might have been a}} bluff, but I fancy that Lady Delahaye was in earnest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I {{went up to}} Brest, where I thought I {{might find}} some sort of steamer which might suit me, and in that harbor <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>find</b> an English steamer, which had {{discharged}} her cargo and was expectin' to sail again pretty much in ballast and brandy, so far as I could make out. I went to this vessel and I made an offer to her captain to charter her for an excursion of one week--that was all I wanted.|$|E
40|$|This paper evaluates three {{possible}} explanations for why empirical studies have found a quite moderate response of multinationals' capital structure to tax incentives. Firstly, by concentrating on debt decisions by operating subsidiaries, previous studies may have overlooked the importance of holding companies. Secondly, international transfer-pricing guidelines may reduce the tax incentives for debt financing. And thirdly, debt as a tax planning tool may be especially used by large multinationals. Whereas <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>find</b> empirical evidence {{in favor of the}} third hypothesis, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>find</b> empirical evidence for the first and the second hypothesis. business taxation, tax planning, leverage, corporate finance...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{do think}} people are so conventional. Don't you?" [...] said Gertie, while Carl discerningly stole one of Ray's best cigars out of the humidor. [...] "Awfully conventional. Not going out for good long walks. Dorothy Gibbons and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>find</b> the nicest place to walk, up in Bronx Park, and there's such a dear little restaurant, right on the water; of course the water was frozen, but it seemed quite wild, you know, for New York. We might take that walk, {{whenever}} you'd like to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, thank God--or I {{should never}} have found you here. Poor old Gloody came to us, in search of help. 'My master's in a swoon, and I can't bring him to.' Directly I heard that, I remembered that you had drunk what he had drunk. What had {{happened}} to him, must have happened to you. Don't ask me how long it was before I found you, and what I felt when <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>find</b> you. I do so want to enjoy my happiness! Only let me see you safely home, and I ask no more." ...|$|E

60|$|Well, I did {{not find}} that, but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>find</b> the receipt from the Mont de Piété for a parure of {{emeralds}} on which half a million francs had been lent. This I carefully put away in my waistcoat pocket, but as {{there was nothing else}} I wished to do just then I extinguished the light and made my way cautiously out of the apartment and out of the house. No one had seen me enter or go out, and M. le Marquis had not stirred while I went through his pockets.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it; but I've seen a wreck since then, and it {{has about}} scared the paint off me. I'm not going to guy anyone as long as I steam--not when they're new to the {{business}} an' anxious to learn. And I'm not goin' to guy the old Mogul either, though <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>find</b> him wreathed around with roastin'-ears.

6000|$|Northwick {{ate with}} wolfish greed, {{and as the}} victuals {{refreshed}} and fortified him, he came out with his story, slowly, bit by bit. Pinney listened with mute admiration. [...] "Well, sir," [...] he said, [...] "it's the biggest thing I ever heard of." [...] But his face darkened. [...] "I suppose you know it leaves me out in the cold. I came up here," [...] he explained, [...] "as the agent of your friends, to find you, and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>find</b> you.

500|$|Craig {{has been}} {{reluctant}} to discuss his religious beliefs. During an interview about the apparently anti-religious message of the 2007 film, The Golden Compass, in which Craig starred, he stated: [...] "I've never been religious and I’m not a church-goer, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>find</b> religion fascinating because it has such a huge impact on our lives".|$|R

"You {{are very}} kind and very welcome. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>find</b> pleasures to beguile my loneliness, which gayer {{people would not}} enjoy, and it is well that I can, else I should turn morose and tyrannical, and doom some unfortunate to {{entertain}} me all day long."

40|$|In recent work, {{economist}} Yew-Kwang Ng suggests {{strategies for}} improving animal welfare {{within the confines}} of institutions such as the meat industry.

Nicky Perrata, a Greek boy, taught me my letters, {{and it was}} n't till after I learned to read that I found out there was {{anything}} really wrong in bay-pirating. I 'd been used to it ever since I could remember, and almost all the people I knew made their living that way. But when <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>find</b> out, I ran away, thinking to quit it for good. I 'll tell you about it sometime, and how I 'm back at it again.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>find</b> a ladder, and {{fortunately}} {{it was long}} enough. Mr. and Mrs. Sparrow were out when I arrived, possibly on the hunt for cheap photo frames and Japanese fans. I {{did not want to}} make a mess. I removed the house neatly into a dust-pan, and wiped the street clear of every trace of it. I had just put back the ladder when Mrs. Sparrow returned with a piece of pink cotton-wool in her mouth. That was her idea of a colour scheme: apple-blossom pink and Reckitt's blue side by side. She dropped her wool and sat on the waterspout, and tried to understand things.|$|E

There will be nothing to alarm him, if I go to his mother's sister. If you could see Lady Northlake, you would feel as sure as I do that she will take my part.|$|E
