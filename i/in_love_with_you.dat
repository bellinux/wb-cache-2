25|$|Arena's latest venture, her {{new album}} Eleven, is so named {{because it is the}} 11th album of her {{recording}} career, but also because she likes its astrological implications' '11' being a figure of enlightenment and artistic sensitivity. Like its predecessor, 2013's Reset, Eleven is a pop-heavy collection, featuring songwriting collaborations with, among others, Kate Miller-Heidke, Hayley Warner and Evermore's Jon Hume. Her new album, was recorded in Sydney, Melbourne, London and Stockholm, as well as in Paris. The Eleven album is a mix of atmospheric electronica (Unravel Me, Overload), smouldering anthems (Wouldn't Be Love If It Didn't, Love Falls, Not Still <b>in</b> <b>Love</b> <b>with</b> <b>You)</b> and dance-friendly pop (Magic). Arena's most recent release, Eleven, became her seventh Top 10 album in Australia by debuting at No. 2 on the ARIA album chart in November 2016, and is now certified gold.|$|E
500|$|... "I'll Be Your Lover, Too" [...] was {{inspired}} by Morrison and Planet's marriage. This acoustic ballad has a moderate 4/4 tempo, with one 5/8 bar before the vocal comes in. [...] "Blue Money", a pun-filled reference to Morrison's financial situation, is about a model, perhaps his wife. (Planet worked in the industry before meeting Morrison.) [...] "Sweet Jannie" [...] is the second twelve-bar blues on the album; written about young love, the song is another that reviewers speculated was about Planet. The lyrics, [...] "I've been <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> baby / Ever since you were in Sunday school" [...] lead Clinton Heylin {{to believe it was}} written about memories from Morrison's childhood when he attended Sunday school in Belfast; Planet is a California-raised Texan.|$|E

500|$|... "Dangerously in Love 2" [...] is a {{moderate}} R, soul and quiet storm ballad pacing in medium time. It {{was written in}} the key of F major, and moves at {{a moderate}} tempo set at 100 beats per minute. Vocal elements of the song range from E3 to D5. [...] "Dangerously in Love" [...] is backed by piano and thumping drum instrumentation. Many music critics noted it to be musically similar to the original Destiny's child version. Lyrically, the song is about being romantically obsessed, as indicated in the chorus: [...] "I am <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> / You set me free / I can't do this thing called life without you here with me". According to Lisa Verrico of The Times, [...] "Dangerously in Love 2" [...] bears resemblance to Janet Jacksons work if viewed from a [...] "flirty" [...] perspective.|$|E
500|$|... "Juxtapozed with U" [...] is 3 minutes 8 seconds {{long and}} is in the key of A major. The track begins with a drum fill, {{featuring}} flanging, before a harp, strings, acoustic guitar and bass join at 2 seconds. An electric guitar joins at 13 seconds playing a melody line. The song breaks down at 25 seconds for the first verse with just bass, drums, acoustic guitar and occasional synthesizer accompanying Gruff Rhys's vocals which are fed through a vocoder. The first chorus begins at 47 seconds with the strings and harp re-entering while Rhys sings the words [...] "You've got to tolerate all those people that you hate, I'm not <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> but I won't hold that against you" [...] twice without the use of a vocoder. The song breaks down again for the second verse after which the second chorus enters at 1 minute 33 seconds. The outro begins at 1 minute 58 seconds with Rhys singing [...] "Let's get juxtaposed, juxtaposed, just suppose I'm juxtaposed with you" [...] supported by harmony backing vocals. The rest of the band continue singing these words while Rhys begins singing the chorus lyrics, starting at 2 minutes 43 seconds. The track ends with Rhys singing the words [...] "Let's get juxtaposed" [...] backed only by harmony vocals.|$|E
