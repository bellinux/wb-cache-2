40|$|Many {{farmers are}} sowing mixed swards {{containing}} chicory (Cichorium intybus), plantain (Plantago lanceolata), red clover (Trifolium pratense) and white clover (T. repens) (hereafter termed <b>herb</b> <b>and</b> clover mix). This <b>herb</b> <b>and</b> clover mix has comparable annual dry matter (DM) production to perennial ryegrass white clover pasture (rye/wc), however, {{it has a}} different pattern of growth, producing more DM during summer <b>and</b> autumn. The <b>herb</b> <b>and</b> clover mix also has a higher nutritive value {{and is able to}} support greater rates of animal production, especially over summer, than rye/ wc in both sheep <b>and</b> cattle. The <b>herb</b> <b>and</b> clover mix is most suited to a rotational grazing interval of 3 – 4 weeks to an 8 cm residual height, with no winter grazing. When managed appropriately the <b>herb</b> <b>and</b> clover mix is able to persist for at least 2 years and up to 5 years under both sheep and cattle grazing. fals...|$|R

Many different spices, <b>herbs</b> <b>and</b> flavourings are used in conjunction with palm oil or groundnut oil to create deeply flavoured sauces and soups often made very hot with chili peppers. Nigerian feasts are colourful and lavish, while aromatic market and roadside snacks cooked on barbecues or fried in oil are plentiful and varied.|$|E
5|$|The adult russet sparrow {{is mostly}} a seed-eater, eating the seeds of <b>herbs</b> <b>and</b> weeds as well as rice, barley, and other grains. Berries, {{such as those of}} the kingore (certain Berberis spp.), are also eaten when available. Nestlings are fed mostly on insects, {{especially}} caterpillars and larval beetles obtained on trees and flying insects caught by aerial pursuit. During the breeding season adults also consume insects.|$|E
5|$|The {{biological}} {{interest is}} focused on the species-rich mesotrophic grassland found across the site, which is actively maintained by grazing. The species present are predominantly grasses, although <b>herbs</b> <b>and</b> orchids are also found. The area has been classified as MG5 under the British National Vegetation Classification because of the species composition. The site is small and isolated, and therefore requires careful management to avoid damage caused by activity on neighbouring land.|$|E

5|$|Various {{types of}} sausage {{are part of}} Sephardi and Mizrahi cuisine in Israel. Jews from Tunisia make a sausage, called osban, with a filling of ground meat or liver, rice, chopped spinach, and a blend of <b>herbs</b> <b>and</b> spices. Jews from Syria make smaller sausages, called gheh, with a {{different}} spice blend while Jews from Iraq make the sausages, called mumbar, with chopped meat and liver, rice, and their traditional mix of spices.|$|E
5|$|A large {{variety of}} {{eggplant}} salads and dips {{are made with}} roasted eggplants. Baba ghanoush, called salat ḥatzilim in Israel, is made with tahina and other seasonings such as garlic, lemon juice, onions, <b>herbs</b> <b>and</b> spices. The eggplant is sometimes grilled over an open flame so that the pulp has a smoky taste. A particularly Israeli variation of the salad is made with mayonnaise called salat ḥatzilim b'mayonnaise. Eggplant salads are also made with yogurt, or with feta cheese, chopped onion and tomato, or {{in the style of}} Romanian Jews, with roasted red pepper.|$|E
5|$|At higher elevations, {{mountain}} hemlock and subalpine fir are {{the most}} common trees. Alaska cedar and whitebark pine are also present. However, as the elevation increases, the forest becomes increasingly fragmented, and is interspersed with meadows consisting of grasses, <b>herbs,</b> <b>and</b> shrubs. Scree slopes are also common. Temperatures can vary greatly within one day due to the high altitude of the habitat and lack of forest cover. For the same reasons, the parkland also experiences increased solar radiation. At the upper edge of the parkland, trees tend to be stunted, and grow in small clumps. Common shrubs include heather and mountain huckleberry. Off-trail hiking can be very destructive in the sub-alpine zone.|$|E
40|$|<b>Herb</b> <b>and</b> legume sward mixes {{containing}} chicory (Cichorium intybus), plantain (Plantago lanceolata), {{red clover}} (Trifolium pratense) and white clover (T. repens) are being increasingly used by farmers to improve animal performance compared to perennial ryegrass and white clover swards. However, {{little is known}} about the agronomic properties of this <b>Herb</b> <b>and</b> Legume Mix. The objectives of this research were to examine key factors likely to affect the success of the <b>Herb</b> <b>and</b> Legume Mix as a perennial sward mix. This thesis included a series of glasshouse experiments, a grazing experiment (examining plant parameters and animal grazing preference) and a mowing experiment. The glasshouse experiments indicated that chicory and plantain have different strategies for coping with moisture stress. The results suggest plantain may be more productive under moderate drought due to its greater shoot mass fraction, whereas chicory may be more productive and persistent under severe drought due to its greater root mass and taproot diameter. The <b>Herb</b> <b>and</b> Legume Mix accumulated greater annual dry matter when removed under Hard grazing (post-grazing residual of 4 cm) compared to Lax grazing (post-grazing residual of 8 cm). Hard grazing favoured plantain growth and persistence, while Lax grazing favoured red clover growth and resulted in chicory with a larger taproot diameter. It was concluded that grazing management decisions should be determined by ensuring optimal management of chicory. Ewe lambs displayed grazing preference for species within the <b>Herb</b> <b>and</b> Legume Mix; however this varied between seasons and was affected by the species availability, vertical access <b>and</b> palatability. The <b>Herb</b> <b>and</b> Legume Mix had a greater herbage nutritive value than the ryegrass and white clover sward and had a more stable composition over time than pure swards of chicory and plantain under a wide range of defoliation regimes. The results suggest the <b>Herb</b> <b>and</b> Legume Mix might be a more flexible perennial forage option than pure swards of chicory and plantain. Overall the results of this thesis indicated that the <b>Herb</b> <b>and</b> Legume Mix can be successfully utilised in most New Zealand grazing systems as a perennial forage sward...|$|R

5|$|Both species {{live on the}} ground, {{are active}} during the night, are solitary, and feed mainly on fruits and seeds, but may also eat <b>herbs</b> <b>and</b> insects. They build nests of leaves and {{branches}} among vegetation, for example in a tree hollow, or under rocks. In Panama, T.talamancae breeds throughout the year and the average litter size is about six. Various species of mites, chiggers, fleas, and sucking lice have been recorded as parasites on both species.|$|E
5|$|Chicken is {{the most}} widely eaten meat in Israel, {{followed}} by turkey. Chicken is prepared in a multitude of ways, from simple oven-roasted chicken to elaborate casseroles with rich sauces such as date syrup, tomato sauce, etc. Examples include chicken casserole with couscous, inspired by Moroccan Jewish cooking, chicken with olives, a Mediterranean classic, and chicken albondigas (meat balls) in tomato sauce, from Jerusalem Sephardi cuisine. Albondigas are also prepared from ground meat., similar to albogindas is the more popular Kufta which is made of minced meat, <b>herbs</b> <b>and</b> spices and cooked with tomato sauce, date syrup, pomegranate syrup or tamarind syrup with vegetables or beans.|$|E
5|$|Cooking in {{southern}} England was noted for {{a tendency toward}} frying, simmering, and roasting, and this also became true for Virginian cooking. Wealthy households tended to vary cooking methods greatly, while poor households were generally confined to boiling and frying. The only form of cooking that was slow to develop was baking. Typical dishes among the upper classes were fricassees of various meats with <b>herbs,</b> <b>and</b> sometimes {{a good amount of}} claret. Common food among the lower classes was corn porridge or mush, hominy with greens and salt-cured meat, and later the traditional southern fried chicken and chitlins.|$|E

5|$|Dietary {{supplements}} often contain vitamins, but {{may also}} include other ingredients, such as minerals, <b>herbs,</b> <b>and</b> botanicals. Scientific evidence supports the benefits of dietary supplements for persons with certain health conditions. In some cases, vitamin supplements may have unwanted effects, especially if taken before surgery, with other dietary supplements or medicines, or if the person taking them has certain health conditions. They may also contain levels of vitamins many times higher, and in different forms, than one may ingest through food.|$|E
5|$|Glamorgan sausage (Welsh: Selsig Morgannwg) is a {{traditional}} Welsh vegetarian sausage for which the main ingredients are cheese (usually Caerphilly), leeks and breadcrumbs. The earliest published mention of the dish is from the 1850s in the book Wild Wales by George Borrow, although earlier records in the Glamorgan Archives show a version which contains pork. The modern vegetarian version became popular during the Second World War when meat was harder to come by, and is now mass-produced by at least two companies. Variations include swapping the leeks for onions, as well as different <b>herbs</b> <b>and</b> spices, and various types of cheese.|$|E
5|$|Human {{impact on}} the {{environment}} has resulted in an increase in the intrabreeding between species, with introduced species worldwide, which has resulted in an increase in hybridization. The genetic mixing may threaten many species with extinction, while genetic erosion in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of many species for future breeding. Many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden <b>herbs</b> <b>and</b> trees have been produced by hybridization. One flower, Oenothera lamarckiana, was central to early genetics research into mutationism and polyploidy.|$|E
