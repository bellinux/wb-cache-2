The block Hessian matrix is constructed by mixing a small critical block of the accurate Hessian for key atoms involved <b>in</b> bond <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> <b>forming</b> with large noncritical blocks of the low-level Hessian.

40|$|As a {{new class}} of {{high-capacity}} cathode materials, the Li-rich Mn-based layer-structured xLi(2) MnO(3) center dot(1 x) LiMO 2 (M = Ni, Co, Mn, etc.) is a promising candidate for constructing high energy-density Li-ion batteries. Unfortunately, drawbacks such as oxygen evolution, poor rate performance and potential fading during cycling hinder their commercial applications. Migration of the transition metal (Mn) into the Li layer of Li 2 MnO 3 and the resultant irreversible structural transition are believed to be responsible for these issues. Therefore, it is essential to explore the driving force for the Mn migration. In this study, we show, starting from understanding the impact of O and Li vacancies on the migration of the Mn atoms by the first-principles molecular dynamics simulation, that Mn migration is closely involved <b>in</b> the <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> <b>forming</b> of the Mn-O bonds of the MnO 6 octahedron and its continuous distortion (MnOx, 4 <= x <= 6). In addition, Mn migration along with the generation of O vacancy lowers the delithiation potential. Inconsistent with conventional beliefs, Mn migration into the Li layer was found to promote, rather than block, Li diffusion in some cases. The mechanism for MnO 6 distortion provides new insight into understanding the micro mechanism of the layered-to-spinel structural transition and revealing the designing of superior cathode materials...|$|R
40|$|Protein kinases, {{representing}} one of {{the largest}} protein families involved in almost all aspects of cell life, have become {{one of the}} most important targets for the development of new drugs to be used in, for instance, cancer treatments. In this article an exhaustive theoretical study of the phosphoryl transfer reaction from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to dihydroxyacetone (Dha) catalyzed by DhaK from Escherichia coli (E. coli) is reported. Two different mechanisms, previously proposed for the phosphoryl transfer from ATP to the hydroxyl side chain of specific serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues, have been explored based on the generation of free energy surfaces (FES) computed with hybrid QM/MM potentials. The results suggest that the substrate-assisted phosphoryl and proton-transfer mechanism is kinetically more favorable than the mechanism where an aspartate would be activating the Dha. Although the details of the mechanisms appear to be dramatically dependent on the level of theory employed in the calculations (PM 3 /MM, B 3 LYP:PM 3 /MM, or B 3 LYP/MM), the transition states (TSs) for the phosphoryl transfer step appear to be described as a concerted step with different degrees of synchronicity <b>in</b> the <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> <b>forming</b> bonds process <b>in</b> both explored mechanisms. Residues of the active site belonging to different subunits of the protein, such as Gly 78 B, Thr 79 A, Ser 80 A, Arg 178 B, and one Mg 2 + cation, would be stabilizing the transferred phosphate in the TS. Asp 109 A would have a structural role by posing the Dha and other residues of the active site in the proper orientation. The information derived from our calculations not only reveals the role of the enzyme and the particular residues of its active site, but it can assist in the rational design of new more specific inhibitors...|$|R
