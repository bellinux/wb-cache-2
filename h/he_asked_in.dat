25|$|Between July and October 1940, de Gaulle {{rejected}} the unconstitutional, repressive and racist laws instituted by Pétain, and established his own bona fides (good faith) {{as the principal}} defender of republican values. <b>He</b> <b>asked,</b> <b>in</b> his Appeal of 18 June 1940, that every patriot who could reach British territory should do so and join the Free French Army to fight in company with the Allies. The Free French forces also rallied the various French overseas colonies to fight back against the Vichy régime. His approval of this link between the Résistance and the colonials legitimised it.|$|E

[...] Paul conceded {{that he would not}} win the election but explained that votes for his ticket would give a bigger voice to Libertarian issues in American politics, and that he would only be disappointed if he did not receive at least 5% of the vote in the state. A few weeks later, The New York Times discovered that many former members of the Pat Robertson campaign were helping Ron Paul's candidacy. They found that the campaign workers were disseminating literature in Michigan that criticized Bush, and stated that Paul would [...] "carry the standard" [...] of the free market. Paul commented in a San Diego Union interview that he [...] "identifwith Robertson" [...] although [...] "he's not a libertarian." [...] Paul spent the beginning of August, campaigning {{in his home state of}} Texas.|$|E

I was a little aggravated by the loooong animated menus that introduce all the characters, one by one, but it's really that missing episode that has me upset." [...] Bovberg described the set as [...] "annoying" [...] for missing the episode.

500|$|Anglin officially {{endorsed}} Donald Trump {{for president}} in 2015. Anglin encouraged the website's readers to [...] "vote {{for the first time}} in our lives for the one man who actually represents our interests". The website also received national and international coverage for its endorsement of Trump's proposal of a temporary moratorium on admitting foreign Muslims into the country; it proclaimed [...] "Heil Donald Trump – The Ultimate Savior". According to the SPLC, white supremacist endorsement of Trump is unprecedented, as the movement is generally skeptical of all politicians. In July 2016, Andrew Anglin and The Daily Stormer were mentioned by Lacy Clay, Democratic Representative from Missouri, as <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>in</b> a congressional hearing whether FBI director James Comey was aware of Trump sharing Twitter posts by white supremacists. [...] Anglin wrote in July 2016 that he believed that Trump was a pragmatic anti-Semite who praised Israel to win votes from evangelical Christians, while dropping subtle hints about purported Jewish domination of rival Hillary Clinton's campaign. The Huffington Post journalist Jessica Schulberg compared how white nationalists like Anglin and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke believed Trump to be representative of their ethnic interests, while at the same time several Jews believed him to be representative of theirs.|$|E

Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, and Harry Blackmun {{generally}} were quiet; however, the silence of Thomas stood out in the 1990s as the other eight justices engaged in active questioning. The New York Times Supreme Court correspondent Adam Liptak has called it a [...] "pity" [...] that Thomas does not ask questions, saying that he has a [...] "distinctive legal philosophy and a background entirely different from that of any other justice" [...] and that those <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>in</b> the 2001 and 2002 terms were [...] "mostly good questions, brisk and pointed."

Moreover, he is in the Protestant {{cemetery}} there, where Shelley’s three-year-old son is buried as well; and yet, as if mocking all despair, a [...] "light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread."

2500|$|William Hogarth's {{painting}} [...] {{features a}} flautist (who {{stands next to}} a painting of Zeus, as an eagle, abducting Ganymede), which may be a satirical depiction of Frederick – thereby publicly outing him as a homosexual as early as 1744. Frederick certainly {{spent much of his}} time at Sanssouci, his favourite residence in Potsdam, in a circle that was exclusively male, though a number of his entourage were happily married. The palace gardens include a Temple of Friendship (built as a memorial to Wilhelmine), which celebrate the homoerotic attachments of Greek Antiquity, and which is decorated with portraits of Orestes and Pylades, amongst others. At Sanssouci Frederick entertained his most privileged guests, especially the French philosopher Voltaire, whom <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>in</b> 1750 to come to live with him. Their literary correspondence and friendship, which spanned almost 50 years, was marked by mutual intellectual fascination, and began as a flirtation. However, in person Frederick found Voltaire difficult to live with, and was often annoyed by Voltaire's many quarrels with his other friends. Voltaire's angry attack on Maupertuis, the President of Frederick's academy, in the form of Le Diatribe du Docteur Akakia provoked Frederick to burn the pamphlet publicly and put Voltaire under house arrest, after which Voltaire left Prussia.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 April 1940, Norway was {{invaded by}} Nazi Germany. Part of the {{background}} for Lange's predictions about the future war was the letters he sent to several foreign heads of state, including Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>in</b> a letter what Hitler's plans were with his [...] "Third Reich", and received response from German authorities that [...] "Nazi Germany will triumph on all fronts." [...] Lange had several Jewish friends, and considered their situation to be under such threat in 1939/40 that he thought they should escape before a German invasion of Norway. He managed to reserve 100 seats on the Norwegian America Line for Jews to escape, {{but none of the}} seats were taken. Lange and several of his friends from the Fatherland League were eager to join the resistance forces of the Norwegian Campaign, and they set out to Nordmarka on skis on 10 April. Lange had with him a machine gun and 1,000 bullets, but was forced to turn his weapon in when they met other resistance members. He was considered to be [...] "not reliable" [...] on account of his time in the Fatherland League, and he was left to ski back to Oslo. Lange became dejected and bitter {{as a result of his}} treatment, and he was left to think that the Labour Party, which he had criticised for not arming the defence before the invasion, had now also taken over control of Nordmarka.|$|E

2500|$|Jaffe {{eventually}} set {{three conditions}} for the casting of Brando: That {{he would have to}} take a fee far below what he typically received; he'd have to agree to accept financial responsibility for any production delays his behavior cost; and he had to submit to a screen test. Coppola convinced Brando to a videotaped [...] "make-up" [...] test, in which Brando did his own makeup (he used cotton balls to simulate the character's puffed cheeks). Coppola had feared Brando might be too young to play the Don, but was electrified by the actor's characterization as the head of a crime family. Even so, he had to fight the studio in order to cast the temperamental actor. Brando had doubts himself, stating in his autobiography, [...] "I had never played an Italian before, and I didn't think I could do it successfully." [...] Eventually, Charles Bluhdorn, the president of Paramount parent Gulf+Western, was won over to letting Brando have the role; when he saw the screen test, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>in</b> amazement, [...] "What are we watching? Who is this old guinea?" [...] Brando was signed for a low fee of $50,000, but in his contract, he was given a percentage of the gross on a sliding scale: 1% of the gross for each $10million over a $10million threshold, up to 5% if the picture exceeded $60million. According to Evans, Brando sold back his points in the picture for $100,000, as he was in dire need of funds. [...] "That $100,000 cost him $11million," [...] Evans claimed.|$|E
2500|$|Heseltine was {{disappointed}} not {{to receive the}} support of old allies on the second ballot; these included Tom King (whom <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>in</b> vain to second his nomination, but who supported Douglas Hurd), Cecil Parkinson and Norman Lamont (who managed Major’s campaign). Over the weekend on 24–25 November, many Conservative MPs were faced with the anger of their local party members who overwhelmingly supported Thatcher but did not at that time have a vote in leadership elections, and opinion polls showed that chancellor John Major would also boost Conservative support if leader (previously Heseltine's unique selling-point). In the second ballot, {{a week after the}} first, Heseltine's vote actually fell to 131 (just over 35%) as some MPs had voted for him in the first ballot as a protest against or to try to oust Thatcher but preferred to vote for other candidates now that they had a wider choice. John Major, with 185 votes, was only two votes short of an overall majority. Heseltine immediately and publicly conceded defeat, announcing that he would vote for Major if the third ballot went ahead (it did not, as Hurd, who had finished a distant third, also conceded). Although {{for the rest of his}} career Heseltine's role in Thatcher's downfall earned him enmity from Thatcher's supporters in the Conservative party, this opprobrium was not universal. In a reference to the reluctance of the Cabinet to support Thatcher on the second ballot, Edward Leigh said of Heseltine: [...] "At least he stabbed her in the front".|$|E
