5000|$|The {{fire was}} {{probably}} {{caused by a}} cigarette left burning on a balcony, which had become hot enough to melt the balcony divides made from plastic polycarbonate, a material that had been approved by international cruise line safety rules. The fire caused scorching damage in up to 150 cabins, and smoke damage in at least 100 more on passenger decks 9 to 12 (Dolphin, Caribe, Baja and Aloha decks). A passenger, Richard Liffidge, 72, of Georgia, died from [...] "asphyxia secondary to inhalation of smoke and <b>irrespirable</b> gases" [...] and thirteen other passengers suffered significant smoke inhalation.|$|E
50|$|In total, only 11 bodies (eight {{miners and}} the three rescue men) were ever {{recovered}} from the mine. Inquests recorded {{the cause of death}} as carbon monoxide poisoning. The mine shafts remained sealed for six months, after which unaffected districts were gradually re-entered. Recovery teams first entered the pit, using breathing apparatus, on 7 March 1935. The damage caused by explosions and by the water directed down the pit was severe, and efforts concentrated on building stoppings so that fresh air could be readmitted to the pit. In May, Parry Davies, captain of the Llay Main No. 2 rescue team, accompanied by two inspectors and a Ministry of Mines doctor, entered into the 20's return airway to recover the body of John Lewis of Cefn-y-Bedd, {{one of the members of}} the No. 1 team killed in the initial rescue attempts. By July, a party of men using breathing apparatus had proceeded 700 yards beyond the stoppings into the Dennis section as far as the top of the haulage road of the 142's Deep, though they found no trace of any of the missing miners. Within a matter of months, normal ventilation was restored to the Slant section: this work was, to that date, the first ever reopening of a pit by men working in an <b>irrespirable</b> atmosphere. However, the mining inspectors refused to allow recovery teams to go further into the Dennis districts to retrieve bodies after retrieving air samples from beyond the permanent stoppings (the mine's ventilation system), this was despite calls from the workers themselves that they should be allowed to do so. Dennis was never reopened; the bodies of the remaining 254 victims of the disaster would be left in the sealed districts.|$|E
40|$|First void urine {{samples were}} {{collected}} from copper smelter workers exposed to inorganic arsenic and from unexposed controls. Arsenic compounds (As (III), As (V), methylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid) in these samples were analyzed by selective volatilization as arsines with determination of arsenic by plasma excitation emission spectrometry. On the day preceding the urine sample collection a breathing zone measurement was made of respirable arsenic particulates for each subject. It was found {{that all of the}} subjects, including the controls excreted arsenic primarily as methylated species. Approximately 50 % of the total arsenic was excreted as dimethylarsinic acid and 20 % as methylarsonic acid. Slight differences in the proportion of various arsenic compounds were observed with varying levels of inorganic arsenic exposure. Amounts of arsenic species were all closely correlated {{with each other and with}} exposure. <b>Irrespirable</b> particulate exposures were measured on a subset of high exposure workers. <b>Irrespirable</b> arsenic was found to be more closely correlated with excretion of arsenic compounds than was respirable arsenic...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1920 s, {{the only}} {{respiratory}} protection which coal miners had available during exposure to toxic or <b>irrespirable</b> environments was a filter self-rescuer that catalytically converted carbon monoxide (CO) to carbon dioxide (CO 2). The deficiencies of this self-rescuer, {{which have been}} described elsewhere (37) led to the support by the Bureau of Mines {{of the development of}} a new generation of self-rescuers which utilized potassium superoxide (KO 2) as the air-revitalization chemical. Since KO 2 reacts with exhaled breath and releases oxygen (O 2) while it absorbs CO 2, the new self-rescuers were closed-circuit devices which isolated the miner from contact with toxic or <b>irrespirable</b> atmospheres. A device with a one-h duration developed by Lockheed under contract with the Bureau of Mines (18) utilized 1. 5 Ib of KO 2, weighed 4. 54 Ib and measured 6. 5 by 3. 6 by 7. 7 in. Since the earlier, filter self-rescuer weighed about 2. 5 lb and was worn continuously by the miner, the one-h, KO 2 -based device represented a substantial addition to the equipment that the miner was accustomed to carrying and, therefore, was considered to be too large and too heavy...|$|E
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is discipline {{which use}} everything as service that provide economic, convenient and on-demand services to requested end users and cloud service consumer. Building a cloud computing network {{is not an}} easy task. It requires lots of efforts and time. For this, there arises a concept called Cloud Engineering. Cloud engineering is a discipline that uses set of processes which help to engineer a cloud network. The structure and principles of cloud engineering {{plays an important role in}} the engineering of usable, economic and vibrant cloud. The cloud engineering use a cloud development life cycle (CDLC) which systematic developed cloud. Quality assurance and verification is an important and mandatory part of development cycle. Quality assurance ensures the quality and web service of cloud network. Cloud Verification is an <b>irrespirable</b> step in a development of an economic cloud computing solution of a network. Verify the performance, reliability, availability, elasticity and security of cloud network against the service level agreement with respect to specification, agreement and requirement. The work in this paper focuses on the Quality Assurance factors and parameters that influence quality. It also discuses quality of data used in a cloud. This paper proposes and explores the structure and its component used in verification process of a cloud...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} {{practice}} of the Mining Rescue Service of the Czech Republic, since 2005, the insulated overpressure regenerative breathing apparatuses with a closed circuit and supply of medicinal oxygen are used as the backbone working breathing apparatuses. At {{the end of the}} year 2010, the compressed-air breathing apparatuses were introduced into the {{practice of the}} Mining Rescue Service of the Czech Republic, which, in precisely defined types of mine rescue service interventions and under precisely defined conditions, can replace the aforementioned backbone working insulated overpressure regenerative breathing apparatuses. Recently, mining rescue services in deep coal mines have been more and more often conducted under conditions of an <b>irrespirable</b> mine atmosphere containing high concentrations of carbon monoxide, but at the same time containing sufficient oxygen for the breathing physiology of mine rescuer (for example, interventions dealing with the disposal of machinery under conditions of occurrence of endogenous mining fire of coal). This fact, after a long time, has resumed again the discussion of miners' rescue experts about whether it would be possible to implement the use of breathing apparatuses filtrating carbon monoxide into practice by the Mining Rescue Services of the Czech Republic in order to ensure a sufficient level of safety for mining rescuers even in an unexpected and rapid decline of the oxygen amount in the mine air at the site of the mine rescue service. The benefit of the breathing apparatuses filtrating carbon monoxide is their significantly lower weight, long protection period and also significantly smaller dimensions and design variability of the device. The disadvantages are higher breathing resistances and a higher temperature of the air mass inhaled from the breathing apparatus filtrating carbon monoxide...|$|E
