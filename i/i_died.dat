5|$|The {{maintenance}} of Taman Sari was abandoned shortly after Hamengkubuwono <b>I</b> <b>died,</b> {{partly because the}} elaborate hydraulic works were so difficult to maintain. The gardens were neglected and the buildings suffered some damage during the Java War of 1825–1830.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond <b>I</b> <b>died</b> in Apulia in 1111. Bohemond II {{was still}} a minor, so his mother {{took charge of the}} {{government}} of Taranto. The Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos sent envoys to Tancred to demand control of Antioch, but Tancred refused to obey and continued to govern the principality. Tancred died in 1112 and bequeathed Antioch to his sister's son, Roger of Salerno.|$|E
5|$|Catherine's {{ability to}} bear children, however, failed to improve her marriage. In 1534, {{at the age}} of 15, Henry had taken as his {{mistress}} the 38-year-old Diane de Poitiers, whom he adored {{for the rest of his}} life. Even so, he respected Catherine's status as his consort. When King Francis <b>I</b> <b>died</b> on 31 March 1547, Catherine became queen consort of France. She was crowned in the basilica of Saint-Denis on 10 June 1549.|$|E

He also possibly had another son named Wahneferhotep. In spite of this, Neferhotep I named his brother Sihathor as coregent in {{the last months of}} his reign and when both Sihathor and Neferhotep <b>I</b> <b>died</b> around the same time, they were succeeded by another brother, Sobekhotep IV.|$|E

In 1819 Kamehameha <b>I</b> <b>died.</b> His son would take Kekāuluohi as one of his own queen consorts however, under the {{influence}} of Christian missionaries, Kamehameha II renounced all his other wives except one. Kekāuluohi was then free to marry Kanaʻina after they both took Christian first names. The couple was married on Kauaʻi.|$|E

5|$|Béla, who {{had been}} Andrew's heir before Solomon's coronation, left for Poland in 1059; his sons {{accompanied}} him. They returned with Polish reinforcements and began a rebellion against Andrew. After defeating Andrew, Béla was crowned king on 6 December 1060. Solomon left the country, taking refuge in the Holy Roman Empire. Béla <b>I</b> <b>died</b> on 11 September 1063, some time before German troops entered Hungary in order to restore Solomon. Ladislaus and his brothers, Géza and Lampert, went back to Poland, and Solomon was once again crowned king in Székesfehérvár. The three brothers returned when the Germans left Hungary. To avoid another civil war, the brothers signed a treaty with Solomon on 20 January 1064, acknowledging Solomon's reign {{in exchange for their}} father's duchy.|$|E
5|$|Despite his successes, when Edward <b>I</b> <b>died</b> in 1307 {{he left a}} {{range of}} {{challenges}} for his son to resolve. One {{of the most critical}} was the problem of English rule in Scotland, where Edward's long but ultimately inconclusive military campaign was ongoing when he died. Edward's control of Gascony created tension with the French kings. They insisted that the English kings should give homage to them for the lands; the English kings saw this demand as insulting to their honour, and the issue remained unresolved. Edward I also faced increasing opposition from his barons over the taxation and requisitions required to resource his wars, and left his son debts of around £200,000 on his death.|$|E
5|$|During the Early Classic, cities {{throughout}} the Maya region {{were influenced by}} the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico. In AD 378, Teotihuacan decisively intervened at Tikal and other nearby cities, deposed their rulers, and installed a new Teotihuacan-backed dynasty. This intervention was led by Siyaj K'ak' ("Born of Fire"), who arrived at Tikal in early 378. The king of Tikal, Chak Tok Ich'aak <b>I,</b> <b>died</b> on the same day, suggesting a violent takeover. A year later, Siyaj K'ak' oversaw the installation of a new king, Yax Nuun Ahiin I. The installation of the new dynasty led to a period of political dominance when Tikal became the most powerful city in the central lowlands.|$|E

5|$|During {{this period}} too, a {{marriage}} was arranged between {{the son of}} Matad, Mormaer of Atholl, and the daughter of Haakon Paulsson, Earl of Orkney. The marriage temporarily secured the northern frontier of the Kingdom, and held out the prospect that a son of one of David's Mormaers could gain Orkney and Caithness for the Kingdom of Scotland. Thus, by the time Henry <b>I</b> <b>died</b> on 1 December 1135, David had more of Scotland under his control than ever before.|$|E
5|$|Edward I of England had a {{great number}} of {{children}} with his first wife, Eleanor of Castile, but only one son who survived into adulthood – the future Edward II (b. 1284). After Eleanor died, the king married Margaret of France, with whom he had two children: Thomas (b. 1300) and, when the king was sixty-two, Edmund. Edmund was born at Woodstock in Oxfordshire on 5 August 1301, and was therefore referred to as Edmund of Woodstock. Son of the English king, he was also, through his mother, grandson of Philip III of France. On 7 July 1307, before Edmund had turned six, King Edward <b>I</b> <b>died,</b> leaving Edmund's half-brother Edward to succeed as King Edward II.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, Zara Yaqob became more despotic. When Takla Hawariat, abbot of Dabra Libanos, criticized Yaqob's beatings {{and murder of}} men, the emperor had the abbot himself beaten and imprisoned, where he died after few months. Zara Yaqob was {{convinced}} of a plot against him in 1453, which led to more brutal actions. He increasingly became convinced that {{his wife and children}} were plotting against him, and had several of them beaten. Seyon Morgasa, the mother of the future emperor Baeda Maryam <b>I,</b> <b>died</b> from this mistreatment in 1462, which led to a complete break between son and father. Eventually relations between the two were repaired, and Zara Yaqob publicly designated Baeda Maryam as his successor.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Ivan Shishman {{was engaged}} in a war against the voivode of Wallachia, Dan I, between 1384 and 1386. There are few details about that war, only a brief note in the Anonymous Bulgarian Chronicle that Dan <b>I</b> <b>died</b> 23 September 1386 after being poisoned. The war {{was linked to the}} {{hostilities}} between Ivan Shishman and Ivan Sratsimir (Dan I's uncle), who had the support of the Wallachian rulers and was married to Anna of the House of Basarab.|$|E
5|$|King Amangkurat <b>I</b> <b>died</b> {{during his}} retreat in Tegal in July 1677. The crown prince succeeded {{his father and}} took the title of Amangkurat II, and was {{accepted}} by the Javanese gentry in Tegal (his grandmother's hometown) {{as well as by}} the VOC. However, he failed to assert his authority in the nearby town of Cirebon, whose ruler decided to declare independence from Mataram with support from the Banten Sultanate. Furthermore, his younger brother Pangeran Puger (later PakubuwanaI) took the now-ruined capital, refused entry to AmangkuratII's loyalists, and declared himself king under the title of Ingalanga Mataram.|$|E
5|$|The Emperors Hadrian, Septimius Severus and Constantius I all held {{court in}} York during their various campaigns. During his stay 207–211AD, the Emperor Severus proclaimed York {{capital of the}} {{province}} of Britannia Inferior, {{and it is likely}} that it was he who granted York the privileges of a colonia or city. Constantius <b>I</b> <b>died</b> in 306AD during his stay in York, and his son Constantine the Great was proclaimed Emperor by the troops based in the fortress. In 311AD a bishop from York attended the Council at Arles to represent Christians from the province.|$|E

5|$|The Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Robert <b>I,</b> <b>died</b> in January 1228. His brother Baldwin II succeeded him, but a regent {{was needed}} to rule the Latin Empire since Baldwin was ten years old. Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria was {{willing to accept the}} regency, but the barons of the Latin Empire {{suspected}} that he wanted to unite the Latin Empire with Bulgaria. They offered the imperial crown instead to John, an ally of the Holy See.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{was initially}} successful: the rebels defeated the royal army at Gegodog (1676), captured {{most of the}} Javanese north coast, and took the Mataram capital Plered (1677). King Amangkurat <b>I</b> <b>died</b> during the retreat of the royal court. His son and successor, Amangkurat II, requested help from the VOC in exchange for financial remuneration and geopolitical concessions. The VOC's subsequent involvement turned the tide of the war. VOC and Mataram forces recovered lost territories and overran Trunajaya's new capital at Kediri (1678). However, the rebellion continued until the capture of Trunajaya {{at the end of}} 1679, and the defeat, death, or surrender of the other rebel leaders (1679–1680). Trunajaya was killed by AmangkuratII personally in 1680 while a prisoner of the VOC.|$|E
5|$|Trajan's {{successor}} Hadrian (r.117–138AD) {{reaffirmed the}} Roman-Parthian border at the Euphrates, {{choosing not to}} invade Mesopotamia due to Rome's now limited military resources.

However, the Roman–Parthian War of 161–166AD began when Vologases invaded Armenia and Syria, retaking Edessa. Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (r.161–180AD) had co-ruler Lucius Verus (r.161–169AD) guard Syria while Marcus Statius Priscus invaded Armenia in 163AD, followed by the invasion of Mesopotamia by Avidius Cassius in 164AD.|$|E
