50|$|A {{flatfish}} is {{a member}} of the order Pleuronectiformes of ray-finned demersal fishes, also called the <b>Heterosomata,</b> sometimes classified as a suborder of Perciformes. In many species, both eyes lie on one side of the head, one or the other migrating through or around the head during development. Some species face their left sides upward, some face their right sides upward, and others face either side upward.|$|E
40|$|Apart {{from the}} work of Thomson and Anderton (1921), Finlay (1928), and Rapson (1940), little is known of the biology of {{southern}} hemisphere <b>Heterosomata.</b> As it is usual for fishery investigations to be first directed towards commercially important species the relative minor importance of the flatfishes in most southern countries accounts for the small contributions made to the knowledge of this interesting group. The three papers referred to above, describe work done in New Zealand...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that a very {{important}} phenomenon accompanying the metamorphosis in the Flatfishes (<b>Heterosomata)</b> is the migration of one of the eyes of the symmetrical larva to the opposite side so that ultimately both the eyes are {{on the same side of}} the body namely, the coloured side. In the case of the Malabar sole (Cynoglossus semifasciatus Day) Seshappa and Bhimachar 1955 have described the various stages in the migration of the eye, the migrating eye being that of the right side...|$|E
40|$|Psettodes erumei (Schneider), popularly {{called the}} 'Indian Turbot' and locally known as 'Bhakas' in Bombay, {{belongs to the}} group of {{flatfishes}} known as <b>Heterosomata.</b> This group comprises the Halibut, Turbot, Sole and Plaice, which in Western countries form a very important group of commercial fishes. Off the Bombay coast, however, the flatfish fishery is of lesser importance owing largely to a traditional prejudice against this group of fishes and {{it was not until the}} introduction of trawlers that the importance of flatfishes, particularly that of P. erumei, was realised. Not only is there a considerable increase in the catch of this fish, but there is' a progressive demand for it as a prime food fish. Considering these potentialities investigation on the fishery of P. erumei and its biology was undertaken...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe gastric {{evacuation}} (at 11 oC and 19 oC) and {{the relation}} between prey size and fish size of juveniles of Buglossidium luteum and Arnoglossus thori (Pisces, <b>Heterosomata)</b> are studied. The fish were collected at 20 m depth in the Banyuls Bay (France, Western Mediterranean). B. luteum showed a very rapid evacuation rate at 19 oC (2 h to 4 h for a IgDW meal) and a slower one at 11 oC (9 h 30 min for a IgDW meal). A. thori showed similar rates at both temperatures (6 h 20 min to 7 h 30 min for a IgDW meal). The relationship between prey size and predator size showed that A. thori always took larger prey than B. luteum. The diet of the latter changes only slightly with the increasing size of the fish. In contrast, the diet of A. thori changes more rapidly towards larger prey. A hypothesis explaining the contradictory evidence concerning the effect of fish and meal size on gastric evacuation is propose...|$|E
40|$|The order <b>Heterosomata,</b> {{the great}} {{group of the}} flatfishes, has long been of major {{economic}} importance in the marine fisheries of the world. Its multiform representatives {{are the subject of}} a very extensive and diverse literature which, however, is but a brief prologue to what research can bring to light. This paper is an attempt to contribute to the knowledge of one member of the group, and it is hoped that it may be of some value to intelligent management of the fishery in the future. The specimens of starry flounder for this study were taken during the last four months of 1946 and throughout the years 1947 and 1948 from the waters of Elkhorn Slough, the mouth of the Salinas River and at various localities in Monterey Bay. In Elkhorn Slough the fish were caught in a bobbinet seine 255 cm. long and 94 cm. deep, with hexagonal meshes of 3 mm. diameter. At the mouth of the Salinas River a minnow seine was used for monthly collections made from September, 1946, to February, 1947. This net measured 3 m. long, 1 1 / 4 m. deep, and had meshes 12 mm. in length. During the period from March, 1947, to August, 1947, the samples from the same locality were taken in a modified beam trawl. This gear had a beam 2 m. long, a depth of 50 cm. and length of 4 m. The mesh length was graduated from 4 cm. at the lead line to 2 cm. in the sack. A bag of bobbinetting was sewed around the sack to impound all fish small enough to pass through the mesh of the sack. The fish taken from Monterey Bay were secured from commercial fishermen and wholesale fish dealers. These fish were caught in trammel nets off Santa Cruz; in drag nets off Monterey and Moss Landing; in purse seines off Capitola, Fort Ord, and Moss Landing; and in crab nets off Moss Landing and the Pajaro River...|$|E
40|$|The digenean Stephanochasmus baccatus (Nicoll, 1907) is a {{parasite}} found in marine flatfish which are {{of importance to}} the mariculture industry in Scotland. In the area of study, Loch Ewe, on the North-west coast of Scotland, the first intermediate hosts are the gastropods Buccinum undatum (L.) and Neptunea antiqua (L.). Several species of teleost fish of the Order <b>Heterosomata</b> act as second intermediate host and the definitive host is Eutrigla gurnardus (L.) or Myoxocephalus scorpius (L.). Aspects of the host/parasite relationships at all the host levels were investigated. Samples of B. undatum and N. antiqua were collected from May to September and the incidence of the natural infections of the major digenean species were recorded. In some samples, height, weight and copulatory organ length were measured {{with a view to}} finding an indicator of parasitism. The histopathology of S. baccatus in the molluscan host was described and seasonal changes discussed in relation to observed variations in the infectivity of cercariae to second intermediate hosts. Groups of 1 + fish were experimentally infected with cercariae at intervals from May to September when no more S. baccatus infections were found in the molluscs. Differences in the infectivity of the cercariae during these months were demonstrated. The pattern of glycogen deposition in both the molluscan digestive gland-and the intra-molluscan larvae were studied in an attempt to explain the loss of infectivity in cercariae in July and August. A. reduction in infectivity of cercariae after ageing was demonstrated experimentally by infecting fish with cercariae which were freshly dissected out and with cercariae kept for 10 hours at 12 Â°C. This loss of infectivity was correlated with loss of glycogen from cercarial tails. A variety of I-group intermediate host species were infected experimentally and the distribution of cysts in the body, fins, skin and muscle were compared with the turbot, Scophthalmus maximus (L.) and the plaice, Pleuronectes lap tessa L. These were shown to differ significantly. Four species of intermediate host which are of culturable significance, S. maximus, P. platessa, the common. dab, Limanda limanda (L.) and the Dover sole, Solea solea (L.) were experimentally infected and the tissue responses to invasion and encystment of S. baccatus were examined sequentially. The inflammatory response and metacercarial growth in each species of fish were found to differ in some important aspects which affected the subsequent viability in the definitive host. The viability of metacercariae from P. platessa and S. maximus were tested by controlled infection of the definitive host M. scorpius. A number of wild caught definitive hosts were examined for natural infections. An attempt gras made to describe the seasonal cycle of events in the life history of S. baccatus based on the information from this and other studies. The relative significance of different host species in different geographic locations was discussed...|$|E
