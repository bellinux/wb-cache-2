The horse was perspiring heavily. And the farmer didn't recognize it so we cornered it. I hopped on the horse's back. Since it had a bridle on, I took hold of the tick rein and said, [...] "Giddy-up." [...] Headed for the highway, I knew the horse would turn in the right direction. I didn't know what the right direction was. And the horse trotted and galloped along. Now and then he would forget he was on the highway and start into a field. So I would pull on him a bit and call his attention to the fact the highway was where he was supposed to be. And finally, about four miles from where I had boarded him, he turned into a farm yard and the farmer said, [...] "So that's how that critter came back. Where did you find him?" [...] I said, [...] "About four miles from here." [...] "How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> should come here?" [...] I said, [...] "I didn't know. The horse knew.

Some of Cao Cao's officers {{were concerned that}} since Yuan Shang was coming home with Yuan Tan at his heels, Yuan Shang's soldiers would theoretically be on [...] "death ground" [...] (死地), where they would fight more fiercely to save themselves according to Sun Tzu's The Art of War. Cao Cao pointed out that he should indeed avoid battle with the reinforcements if Yuan Shang came {{on the main road}} from the east; but if Yuan Shang moved across to the northwestern hills, he would have friendly territory (Gao Gan's Bing province) behind him and his army would be easier to deal with. Yuan Shang approached obliquely from the north, to the delight of Cao Cao. When his scouts told him Yuan Shang's army reached Handan, Cao Cao candidly announced to his generals [...] "I already have Ji Province, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> <b>You</b> shall see soon." ...|$|E

40|$|These {{are very}} common trees on Tiritiri Matangi. Excellent {{examples}} of kanuka {{can be seen}} particularly {{at the top of}} the hill on the Kawerau Track, at the place where the track to the pa goes up to the left. Manuka can be easily seen everywhere on the island, but look along the sides of the track near the end of your walk up through Little Wattle Valley. What does it look like? Manuka are small multi-trunked, bushy trees, which grow to about four metres high. They have very fl aky bark, creamy or pink fl owers, and leaves which feel prickly when you grasp them. The leaves have a strong smell when crushed. When fl owers die they leave broad brown seed pods. Kanuka are taller than manuka. They grow to 15 metres. Kanuka also has very fl aky bark. Their fl owers and seed pods are much smaller and narrower than those of the manuka. What can be found living on it? The manuka and kanuka trees both have very fl aky bark, so there are heaps of nooks and crannies for insects to live in. This in turn means that there is lots of food for birds which like to eat the insects. Tiritiri Matangi: An education resource for schools 147 Has it a use for humans? Both manuka and kanuka are rapid-growing, so are very important colonising trees. Leaves can be brewed to make a tea. The gum was used by Maori to ease coughs (according to botonist Andrew Crowe, the gum looks and tastes like damp icing sugar). Tea tree oil can also be gathered from these plants. Manuka wood shavings are excellent to use to fl avour and preserve fi sh by smoking. Manuka is a favourite honey in modern times. Be careful! With any plants, don’t ever try to eat or use any part of them unless you are very sure they are safe. Maori knew far more about them than we do and even they made some tragic mistakes. Where is it found? Manuka and kanuka are found throughout New Zealand, and a variety is also found in Australia, particularly Tasmania. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> <b>You</b> can tell manuka and kanuka apart by feeling their leaves. Manuka leaves are very spiky to touch, while kanuka leaves are much softer. It is easy to remember this if you think: ‘Kanuka is kind, manuka is mean’. 148 Tiritiri Matangi: An education resource for school...|$|E
