60|$|The {{thing that}} perhaps {{surprised}} Nigel most {{in this strange}} cavern was the blaze of light with which it was filled, for it came down direct through a funnel-shaped hole in the high roof and bore a marvellous resemblance to natural sunshine. He was well aware that unless the sun were shining absolutely in the zenith, the laws of light forbade the entrance of a <b>direct</b> <b>ray</b> into such a place, yet there were the positive rays, although the sun was not yet high in the heavens, blinding him while he looked at them, and casting the shadows of himself and his new friends on the floor.|$|E
60|$|For the rest, {{both the}} tap and parlour of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters gave upon the river, and had red {{curtains}} matching the noses {{of the regular}} customers, and were provided with comfortable fireside tin utensils, like models of sugar-loaf hats, made in that shape that they might, with their pointed ends, seek out for themselves glowing nooks {{in the depths of}} the red coals, when they mulled your ale, or heated for you those delectable drinks, Purl, Flip, and Dog's Nose. The first of these humming compounds was a speciality of the Porters, which, through an inscription on its door-posts, gently appealed to your feelings as, 'The Early Purl House'. For, it would seem that Purl must always be taken early; though whether for any more distinctly stomachic reason than that, as the early bird catches the worm, so the early purl catches the customer, cannot here be resolved. It only remains to add that in the handle of the flat iron, and opposite the bar, was a very little room like a three-cornered hat, into which no <b>direct</b> <b>ray</b> of sun, moon, or star, ever penetrated, but which was superstitiously regarded as a sanctuary replete with comfort and retirement by gaslight, and on the door of which was therefore painted its alluring name: Cosy.|$|E

6000|$|There are {{no doubt}} in the Divina Commedia (regarded merely as poetry) sandy spaces enough both of physics and metaphysics, but with every {{deduction}} Dante remains the first of descriptive as well as moral poets. His verse is as various as the feeling it conveys; now it has the terseness and edge of steel, and now palpitates with iridescent softness like the breast of a dove. In vividness he is without a rival. He drags back by its tangled locks the unwilling head of some petty traitor of an Italian provincial town, lets the fire glare on the sullen face for a moment, and it sears itself into the memory forever. He shows us an angel glowing with that love of God which makes him a star even amid the glory of heaven, and the holy shape keeps lifelong watch in our fantasy constant as a sentinel. He has the skill of conveying impressions indirectly. In the gloom of hell his bodily presence is revealed by his stirring something, on the mount of expiation by casting a shadow. Would he have us feel the brightness of an angel? He makes him whiten afar through the smoke like a dawn,[254] or, walking straight toward the setting sun, he finds his eyes suddenly unable to withstand a greater splendor against which his hand is unavailing to shield him. Even its reflected light, then, is brighter than the <b>direct</b> <b>ray</b> of the sun.[255] And how mack more keenly do we feel the parched lips of Master Adam for those rivulets of the Casentino which run down into the Arno, [...] "making their channels cool and soft"! His comparisons are as fresh, as simple, and as directly from nature as those of Homer.[256] Sometimes they show a more subtle observation, as where he compares the stooping of Antaeus over him to the leaning tower of Garisenda, to which the clouds, flying in an opposite direction to its inclination, give away their motion.[257] His suggestions of individuality, too, from attitude or speech, as in Farinata, Sordello, or Pia,[258] give in a hint what is worth acres of so-called character-painting. In straightforward pathos, the single and sufficient thrust of phrase, he has no competitor. He is too sternly touched to be effusive and tearful: ...|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} pattern for early film studios {{was provided by}} the studio which Georges Méliès had built in 1897.

The soft overall light without real shadows that this arrangement produced, and which also exists naturally on lightly overcast days, was to become the basis for film lighting in film studios for the next decade.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Geometrical Optics (GO) based path loss model for indoor environment path loss prediction. Both Geometrical Optics based total rays model and <b>direct</b> <b>ray</b> path loss model were developed. Optimization was then conducted to improve both models in path loss prediction for case of Line- Of - Sight (LOS) indoor environment. Both Geometrical Optics based total rays model and <b>direct</b> <b>ray</b> model were optimized with log-distance-dependent expression using least-square approach. This log-distance-dependent expression includes all effects due to multiple reflection and all uncertainties which is distance-dependent. The path loss measurement {{was conducted in}} Division of Information Technology (DITSC), Universiti Putra Malaysia. Both models were optimized with measured path loss which was collected from DITSC. The value of correction factor and coefficient in additional expression for optimized GO were developed and presented in this paper. The optimized GO based modes ware validated at five buildings in Universiti Putra Malaysia by referring to the absolute mean error for its accuracy and effectiveness in path loss prediction. The optimized <b>direct</b> <b>ray</b> model shows the best accuracy compared with optimized total rays model, <b>direct</b> <b>ray</b> model and total rays model...|$|E

30|$|The {{threshold}} {{for the first}} ray detection is generally determined by the noise floor. Its value {{is equal to the}} level of the peaks of noise, i.e., to the maximum amplitude of the CIR where the multipath component amplitudes are below noise level. It is obvious that the proposed algorithm works reliably in both LOS and NLOS scenarios, but it fails in some NLOS cases when the first (<b>direct)</b> <b>ray</b> is strongly attenuated and drowned in noise.|$|E

Moreover, these patches enable to exploit the properties of local field functions, and to speed-up considerably the rendering. Extensive statistics of the various optimizations proposed are given and discussed. The implantation into public domain software RayShade is sketched...|$|E
