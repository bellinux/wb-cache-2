5|$|As {{interactions}} between proteins are reversible, and depend <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> availability of {{different groups of}} partner proteins to form aggregates that are capable to carry out discrete sets of function, study of the {{interactions between}} specific proteins {{is a key to}} understand important aspects of cellular function, and ultimately the properties that distinguish particular cell types.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan campaigned <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{platform}} that Carter was weak on defense, citing {{the cancellation of}} the B-1 program as an example, a theme he continued using into the 1980s. During this time Carter's defense secretary, Harold Brown, announced the stealth bomber project, apparently implying {{that this was the}} reason for the B-1 cancellation.|$|E

5|$|South Dakota's early economy relied <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> soil, {{minerals}} and {{ecology of the}} area, as {{nearly all of the}} earliest white settlers in the area were farmers, miners, or trappers. Although other economic sectors have risen in prominence in recent years, early dependence on the land laid the foundation for the future economic activity of the state.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans campaigned <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tariff issue, {{turning out}} {{protectionist}} {{voters in the}} important industrial states of the North. Further, the Democrats in New York were divided over the gubernatorial candidacy of David B. Hill, weakening Cleveland's support in that swing state. A letter from the British ambassador supporting Cleveland caused a scandal which cost Cleveland votes in New York.|$|E

He also published a number of short stories, children's books, and essay collections.|$|E
5|$|Aesthetically glam metal draws <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> glam rock or glitter rock of the 1970s, {{often with}} very long backcombed hair, use of make-up, gaudy {{clothing}} and accessories (chiefly consisting of tight denim or leather jeans, spandex, and headbands). The visual aspects of glam metal appealed to music television producers, particularly MTV, whose establishment {{coincided with the}} rise of the genre. Glam metal performers became infamous for their debauched lifestyles of drugs, strippers and late-night parties, which were widely covered in the tabloid press.|$|E

Lowther, like Stephen, came from an aristocratic family, adopted a masculine style of dress, and was an accomplished fencer, tennis player, motorist and jujitsu enthusiast. In later years she said the character of Stephen was based on her, which may have been partly true.|$|E
5|$|Arulpragasam's early {{compositions}} relied <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Roland MC-505 music sequencer {{and drum}} machine. Her later work marked an evolution in her sound with rare instruments, electronics and unusual sound samples. Critics have acclaimed a distinctive style to her music. Lyrically incorporating {{a range of}} political, social, philosophical and cultural references that have defied existing pop music conventions, Arulpragasam {{was one of the}} first acts to come to public attention through the internet. She posted many of her songs and videos from 2002 onwards on platforms such as MySpace.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{expansion}} of the British Empire, a similar approach was also gaining popularity in Britain. An Anglicised interpretation of Islamic architecture is exemplified by the Brighton Royal Pavilion, completed in 1823, and the Sezincote House, completed a few years earlier. Both these buildings drew <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Islamic motifs, which were later to be evident at the Vorontsov Palace and were new and novel designs {{at the time of the}} Prince's visit to England.|$|E

In the US, firearms {{are the most common}} cause of fatal TBI, followed by vehicle accidents and then falls. Of deaths from firearms, 75% are considered to be suicides.|$|E
5|$|During his reign, Michael relied <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{loyalty and}} support {{of a group of}} Oltenian lords, the most {{important}} of whom were Buzescu Brothers (Romanian: Fraţii Buzeşti) and his own relatives on his mother's side, the Cantacuzinos. He consequently protected their interests throughout his reign; for example, he passed a law binding serfs to lands owned by aristocrats. From the standpoint of religious jurisdiction, the Treaty of Alba Iulia had another important consequence: it placed all the Eastern Orthodox bishops in Transylvania {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Metropolitan Seat of Târgovişte.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 Margaret Mackworth, now {{the second}} Viscountess Rhondda, {{launched}} the Six Point Group, an action group that focused <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> equality {{between men and}} women and the rights of the child.

She established a number of women's organisations, pressure groups and launched the influential feminist journal Time and Tide. She also made an unsuccessful bid to gain entry into the House of Lords, fighting against a 1922 ruling that barred the admission of women.|$|E

5|$|Montserrat, {{just north}} of the storm's center, was warned in advance of the storm but still {{suffered}} £150,000 (1928 UKP) in damages and 42 deaths; Plymouth and Salem were devastated and crop losses caused near-starvation conditions before relief could arrive. All commercial and government buildings on the island were destroyed, as were more than 600homes. Saint Kitts and Nevis also suffered <b>heavily.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> island of St. Kitts, a number of homes built on wooden foundations were demolished. Nine deaths were reported, six of which occurred {{as a result of a}} schoolhouse collapse. Thirteen people were killed on the island of Nevis.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1899, the German {{government}} took formal control, establishing a protectorate. A treaty with Spain, signed on 30 July, ensured German control over several other island {{groups in the}} Pacific, and these {{were added to the}} protectorate of German New Guinea. The economic life of German New Guinea's small population of European and Asian settlers, {{as well as that of}} its Melanesian population, relied <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> export of copra and the import of goods and services. It remained a modest outpost, and by August 1914 only 1,273 Europeans lived in the colony, while there was also a small but significant number of Japanese, Chinese and Malays.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} from the lectures, the Canadian Corps staff {{officers}} produced a tactical analysis of the Verdun battles and delivered a series of corps and divisional-level lectures to promote the primacy of artillery and {{stress the importance of}} harassing fire and company and platoon flexibility.

The final plan for the assault on Vimy Ridge drew <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> experience and tactical analysis of the officers who attended the Verdun lectures. British First Army commander General Henry Horne approved the plan on 5 March 1917.|$|E
