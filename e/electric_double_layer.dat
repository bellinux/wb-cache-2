Using anode and cathode to describe the electrodes in supercapacitors (and also rechargeable batteries including lithium ion batteries) can lead to confusion, because the polarity changes depending on whether a component is considered as a generator or as a consumer of current. In electrochemistry, cathode and anode are related to reduction and oxidation reactions, respectively. However, in supercapacitors based on <b>electric</b> <b>double</b> <b>layer</b> capacitance, there is no oxidation and/or reduction reactions {{on any of the}} two electrodes.

40|$|Abstract. A {{review is}} given {{on a number}} of {{colloidal}} phenomena with special reference to their applicability to nanoparticles. Phenomena addressed include preparation, <b>electric</b> <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> and their characterization, electrokinetics, van der Waals and Lifshits forces, electric and steric particle interaction. Key words: colloid stability, electrokinetics, nanoparticles, <b>electric</b> <b>double</b> <b>layers,</b> polymer and polyelectrolyte adsorption, steric interaction. 1. Nanoparticles, or colloids, a matter of definition “Nanoparticles are small colloidal particles, but not all small colloidal particles are nanoparticles. ” This opening statement may be used to define the topic and scope of the present pa-per. In practice, the definition is sometimes more a matter of habit than of general acceptance. Colloid science has a long history; it dates back to halfway the nineteenth century. The name was coined by Thomas Graham in 1861 after the Greek word κoλλα, meaning glue, because some of his colloidal sys-tems were glue-like. Nowadays we know that most colloid...|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{models are}} {{developed}} for the translation and rotation of metallic rods in a uniform electric field. The limits of thin and thick <b>electric</b> <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> are considered. These models include the effect of stripes of different metals {{along the length of}} the particle. Modeling results are compared to experimental measurements for metallic rods. Experiments demonstrate the increased alignment of particles with increasing field strength and the increase in degree of alignment of thin versus thick <b>electric</b> <b>double</b> <b>layers.</b> The metal rods polarize in the applied field and align parallel to its direction due to torques on the polarized charge. The torque due to polarization has a second order dependence on the electric field strength. The particles are also shown to have an additional alignment torque component due to non-uniform densities along their length. The orientation distributions of dilute suspensions of particles are also shown to agree well with results predicted by a rotational convective-diffusion equation...|$|R

In this paper it is shown that this seeming conflict finds its cause {{in the way the}} <b>double</b> <b>layer</b> is formed: expulsion for <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> forming spontaneously by ion adsorption from the solution, but uptake when the <b>double</b> <b>layer</b> is formed by an external field.

40|$|A model {{based on}} steric {{hindrance}} mechanisms [1] {{is used to}} determine the pore sizes of two ultrafiltration (UF) membranes. The lysozyme rejection coefficients of those membranes are predicted through the same model after modification of the pore size and solute radius by taking into account the development of <b>electric</b> <b>double</b> <b>layers.</b> Two asymmetric cellulose acetate membranes M 1 and M 2 were prepared and characterized. Membrane M 1 has an hydraulic permeability of 2. 1 x 10 - 6 m/s/bar, a molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of 30, 000 Da and an average pore radius of 2. 6 nm. Membrane M 2 has an hydraulic permeability of 5. 9 x 10 - 6 m/s/bar, a molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of 60, 000 Da and an average pore radius of 5. 3 nm. Aqueous solutions of lysozyme containing a NaCl concentration of 0. 1 M were ultrafiltrated through membranes M 1 and M 2. The predicted lysozyme rejections considering the development of <b>electric</b> <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> on the protein and membrane pore surfaces, are in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R
5000|$|Energy transfer: <b>Double</b> <b>layers</b> can {{facilitate}} {{the transfer of}} electrical energy into kinetic energy, dW/dt=I•ΔV where I is the electric current dissipating energy into a <b>double</b> <b>layer</b> with a voltage drop of ΔV. Alfvén {{points out that the}} current may well consist exclusively of low-energy particles. Torvén et al. have postulated that plasma may spontaneously transfer magnetically stored energy into kinetic energy by <b>electric</b> <b>double</b> <b>layers.</b> No credible mechanism for producing such <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> has been presented, however. Ion thrusters can provide a more direct case of energy transfer from opposing potentials in the form of <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> produced by an external electric field.|$|R
5000|$|The work {{function}} {{is not simply}} dependent on the [...] "internal vacuum level" [...] inside the material (i.e., its average electrostatic potential), because {{of the formation of}} an atomic-scale <b>electric</b> <b>double</b> <b>layer</b> at the surface. This surface electric dipole gives a jump in the electrostatic potential between the material and the vacuum.|$|E
50|$|An {{interface}} {{is defined}} as the common boundary formed between two different phases, such as between a solid and gas. Electric potential, or charge, is the result of an object's capacity to be moved in an electric field. An interfacial potential is thus defined as a charge located at the common boundary between two phases (for example, an amino acid such as glutamate on the surface of a protein can have its side chain carboxylic acid deprotonated in environments with pH greater than 4.1 to produce a charged amino acid at the surface, which would create an interfacial potential). Interfacial potential is responsible for the formation of the <b>electric</b> <b>double</b> <b>layer,</b> which has a broad range of applications in what is termed electrokinetic phenomena. The development of the theory of the <b>electric</b> <b>double</b> <b>layer</b> is described below.|$|E

5000|$|A flowFET {{relies on}} the {{principal}} of electro-osmotic flow (EOF). In many liquid-solid interfaces, there is an electrical double layer that develops due to interactions between the two phases. In {{the case of a}} microfluidic channel, this results in a charged layer of liquid {{on the periphery of the}} fluid column which surrounds the bulk of the liquid. This <b>electric</b> <b>double</b> <b>layer</b> has an associated potential difference known as the zeta potential.When an appropriately-oriented electrical field is applied to this interfacial double layer (i.e. parallel to the channel and in the plane of the <b>electric</b> <b>double</b> <b>layer),</b> the charged liquid ions experience a motive Lorentz force. Since this layer sheaths the fluid column, and since this layer moves, the entire column of liquid will begin to move with a speed [...] The velocity of the fluid layer [...] "diffuses" [...] into the bulk of the channel from the periphery towards the centre due to viscous coupling. The speed is related to the strength of the electric field , the magnitude of the zeta potential , the permittivity [...] and the viscosity [...] of the fluid: ...|$|E
50|$|As a charged {{particle}} moves through a gravitational force or centrifugation, an electric potential is induced. While the particle moves, ions in the <b>electric</b> <b>double</b> <b>layer</b> lag behind creating a net dipole moment behind due to liquid flow.

25|$|Electrochemical {{capacitors}} (supercapacitors) {{consist of}} two electrodes separated by an ion-permeable membrane (separator), and an electrolyte ionically connecting both electrodes. When the electrodes are polarized by an applied voltage, ions in the electrolyte form <b>electric</b> <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> of opposite polarity to the electrode's polarity. For example, positively polarized electrodes {{will have a}} layer of negative ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface along with a charge-balancing layer of positive ions adsorbing onto the negative layer. The opposite {{is true for the}} negatively polarized electrode.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} relation {{provides a}} measure of the sedimentation potential due to the settling of charged spheres. First discovered by Smoluchowski in 1903 and 1921. This relationship only holds true for non-overlapping <b>electric</b> <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> and for dilute suspensions. In 1954, Booth proved that this idea held true for Pyrex glass powder settling in a KCl solution. From this relation, the sedimentation potential, ES, is independent of the particle radius and that ES → 0, Φ p → 0 (a single particle).|$|R
50|$|EKI's can be {{leveraged}} {{for rapid}} mixing or can cause undesirable dispersion in sample injection, separation and stacking. These instabilities {{are caused by}} a coupling of electric fields and ionic conductivity gradients that results in an electric body force. This coupling results in an electric body force in the bulk liquid, outside the <b>electric</b> <b>double</b> <b>layer,</b> that can generate temporal, convective, and absolute flow instabilities. Electrokinetic flows with conductivity gradients become unstable when the electroviscous stretching and folding of conductivity interfaces grows faster than the dissipative effect of molecular diffusion.|$|E
50|$|Electrostatic double layers are {{especially}} common in current-carrying plasmas, {{and are very}} thin (typically ten Debye lengths), compared to the sizes of the plasmas that contain them. Other names for a double layer are electrostatic double layer, <b>electric</b> <b>double</b> <b>layer,</b> plasma double layers. The term ‘electrostatic shock’ in the magnetosphere {{has been applied to}} electric fields oriented at an oblique angle to the magnetic field {{in such a way that}} the perpendicular electric field is much stronger than the parallel electric field, In laser physics, a double layer is sometimes called an ambipolar electric field.|$|E
50|$|Unilamellar TiNSs have {{a number}} of unique properties, and are said to combine those of {{conventional}} titanate and titania. Structurally, they are infinite ultrathin (~0.75 nm) 2D sheets with a high density of negative surface charges originating from the oxygen atoms at the corners of the adjoint octahedrons. TiNSs may balance this anionic charge by inserting a counterionic layer between the two sheets either via layering or in aqueous solution. This <b>electric</b> <b>double</b> <b>layer</b> gives the material flexible interlayer distances, high cation exchange capacity, and excellent dielectric capabilities.|$|E
