Immense efforts have been made to determine effective antiglycation compounds from natural products. Pomelo has shown beneficial effects for human health.

Our results showed that the pomelo extract (0. 25 - 2. 00 mg/mL) significantly inhibited the overall formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in a concentration-dependent manner. The pomelo extract markedly decreased the level of fructosamine, which is directly associated with reduction in formation of AGEs and Nε -(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML). In addition, the pomelo extract inhibited protein oxidation through its ability to prevent the loss of thiol groups and reduced protein carbonyl formation.

The antioxidant potential of all fractions were then evaluated in terms of total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, DPPH free radical scavenging potential, reducing potential and total antioxidant capacity by specific standard procedure. The disc diffusion method was incorporated to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity on nutrient agar medium. The highest total phenolic content was found in aqueous fraction (570. 20 ± 0. 48 mg GAE/g of <b>dried</b> <b>extract)</b> while the lowest in the n-Hexane fraction (337. 51 ± 0. 21 mg GAE/g of <b>dried</b> <b>extract).</b> However, ethyl acetate fraction exhibited the highest flavonoid content which amounted to 132. 27 ± 0. 25 mg quercetin equivalents/g of <b>dried</b> <b>extract.</b> Likewise, ethyl acetate fraction showed the highest antioxidant capacity (21. 61 ± 0. 11 g of L-ascorbic acid equivalents/g of <b>dried</b> <b>extract)</b> along with the lowest IC 50 (1. 72 ± 0. 39 µg/ml) & EC 50 (2. 25 ± 0. 75 µg/ml) value. However, DPPH free radical scavenging activity and reducing power of all fractions were found to be concentratio...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine the phytochemical content and the protective effect of red grape skin extract (RGSE) against fructose-mediated protein oxidation. In addition, RGSE was screened for its potential as an antioxidant using various in vitro models. Methods: Antioxidant activity was measured by 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, superoxide radical scavenging activity, trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), ferrous ion chelating power. The total phenols content was measured by Folin–Ciocalteu assay, the flavonoids content by the AlCl 3 colorimetric method. Antiglycation activity was determined using the formation of AGE fluorescence intensity, Nε-(carboxymethyl) lysine, and the level of fructosamine. The protein oxidation was examined using the level of protein carbonyl content and thiol group. Results: The results showed that the content of total phenolics, flavonoids and total anthocyanins in RGSE was 246. 3 ± 0. 9 mg gallic acid equivalent/g <b>dried</b> <b>extract,</b> 215. 9 ± 1. 3 mg catechin equivalent/g <b>dried</b> <b>extract,</b> and 36. 7 ± 0. 8 mg cyanidin- 3 -glucoside equivalent/g <b>dried</b> <b>extract,</b> respectively. In the DPPH radical scavenging activity, hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, and superoxide radical scavenging activity, RGSE had the IC 50 values of 0. 03 ± 0. 01 mg/ml, 5. 40 ± 0. 01 mg/ml, and 0. 58 ± 0. 01 mg/ml, respectively. In addition, RGSE had trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay (395. 65 ± 1. 61 mg trolox equivalent/g <b>dried</b> <b>extract),</b> ferric reducin...|$|R
