The fish were starved for 3 weeks and then fed ad libitum by hand for 3 weeks in the 3 periods studied. The study provided evidence of the adaptation of the fish to starvation followed by what may be termed compensatory growth once feeding was resumed. The length changes of the fish indicate that the weight gains were due to grojth rather than increases in <b>gut</b> <b>fat</b> deposits or increased water uptake...|$|E
40|$|We have {{identified}} an essential cis {{element in the}} proximal promoter region of the rat carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI) gene that is requisite for promoter activity in liver nuclear extracts. Excess synthetic oligonucleotides specifying this region abolished promoter-dependent in vitro transcription. We show that C/EBP, a nuclear factor enriched in liver but found as well in other tissues, such as <b>gut,</b> <b>fat,</b> and lung, interacts with an inverted repeat, GTTGCAAC, {{at the core of}} the essential cis element. In brain, a tissue that did not express CPSI or contain significant levels of C/EBP, a different factor was capable of binding at or near the C/EBP recognition element. Activity of the CPSI promoter in liver nuclear extracts was also dependent on sequences 5 ' to the C/EBP motif; presumably, factors binding to elements within this upstream region are instrumental in restricting CPSI gene expression to liver and intestinal mucosa...|$|E
40|$|The tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus is an {{important}} parasite of cattle {{in many areas of}} the tropics. Characterization of molecules involved in mechanisms such as vitellogenesis and embryo development may contribute to a better understanding of this parasite’s physiology. The vitellin-degrading cysteine endopeptidase (VTDCE) is the most active enzyme involved in vitellin hydrolysis in R. microplus eggs. Here we show an association between VTDCE and vitellin in an additional site, apart from the active site. Our data also demonstrate cysteine endopeptidase activity in different tissues such as ovary, <b>gut,</b> <b>fat</b> body, salivary gland and female haemolymph, where it is controlled by a physiological inhibitor. In R. microplus female gut, VTDCE is localized in areas of protein synthesis and trafficking with the underlying haemolymph. VTDCE is also localized in the ovary basal region, in vesicle membranes of ovary pedicel cells and in oocyte cytosol. These results suggest that VTDCE plays a role in vitellin digestion during tick development...|$|E

40|$|Background: Bacteria are {{associated}} with the <b>gut,</b> <b>fat</b> bodies and reproductive organs of stored product mites (Acari: Astigmata). The mites are pests due to the production of allergens. Addition of antibiotics to diets can help to characterize the association between mites and bacteria. Methodology and Principal Findings: Ampicillin, neomycin and streptomycin were added to the diets of mites and the effects on mite population growth (Acarus siro, Lepidoglyphus destructor and Tyrophagus putrescentiae) and associated bacterial community structure were assessed. Mites were treated by antibiotic supplementation (1 mgg 21 of diet) for 21 days and numbers of mites and bacterial communities were analyzed and compared to the untreated control. Bacterial quantities, determined by real-time PCR, significantly decreased in antibiotic treated specimens from 5 to 30 times in A. siro and T. putrescentiae, while no decline was observed in L. destructor. Streptomycin treatment eliminated Bartonella-like bacteria in the both A. siro and T. putrescentiae and Cardinium in T. putrescentiae. Solitalea-like bacteria proportion increased in the communities of neomycin and streptomycin treated A. siro specimens.

40|$|Access to {{this item}} has been {{restricted}} by repository administrators {{at the request}} of the author until March 8, 2017. Aging is a complex biological phenomenon that alters many different physiological processes. Although many age-related phenotypes, such as neurodegeneration, weakening circadian rhythms, and inflammaging, are well-studied, the links between them are not. To elucidate these links we created an inflammation-like state in Drosophila melanogaster by overexpressing Relish (Rel), an NFκB transcription factor in the Imd innate immunity pathway. Then we observed how aging parameters such as lifespan, locomotor activity rhythms, and neurodegeneration were affected. We found that systemic Rel overexpression causes significant lifespan shortening and increased neurodegeneration. By overexpressing Rel specifically the <b>gut,</b> <b>fat</b> body, head fat body, or neurons, we found that these tissues were not responsible for the lifespan shortening that was observed with systemic Rel overexpression. While increased Rel shortens lifespan and increase neurodegeneration, it has no detrimental effects on rhythms of locomotor activity. We conclude that age-related increase in Rel expression in wild-type flies may be linked with accelerated aging and that Rel overexpression could serve as possible model to study mechanisms of inflammaging in Drosophila. Further experiments are needed to understand why Rel overexpression causes lifespan shortening and neurodegeneration, especially to investigate the possible role of the glia and genes downstream of Rel...|$|E
40|$|We {{have found}} two novel lipocalins in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster that are {{homologous}} to the grasshopper Lazarillo, a singular lipocalin within this protein family which functions in axon guidance during nervous system development. Sequence analysis {{suggests that the}} two Drosophila proteins are secreted and possess peptide regions unique in the lipocalin family. The mRNAs of DNLaz (for Drosophila neural Lazarillo) and DGLaz (for Drosophila glial Lazarillo) are expressed with different temporal patterns during embryogenesis. They show low levels of larval expression and are highly expressed in pupa and adult flies. DNLaz mRNA is transcribed in a subset of neurons and neuronal precursors in the embryonic CNS. DGLaz mRNA is found in a subset of glial cells of the CNS: the longitudinal glia and the medial cell body glia. Both lipocalins are also expressed outside the nervous system in the developing <b>gut,</b> <b>fat</b> body and amnioserosa. The DNLaz protein is detected in a subset of axons in the developing CNS. Treatment with a secretion blocker enhances the antibody labeling, indicating the DNLaz secreted nature. These findings make the embryonic nervous system expression of lipocalins a feature more widespread than previously thought. We propose that DNLaz and DGLaz may {{have a role in}} axonal outgrowth and pathfinding, although other putative functions are also discussed.

Apart from causing significant damage to pinewoods, T. pityocampa occurrence is also an issue for public and animal health, as it is responsible for dermatological reactions in humans and animals by contact with its irritating hairs. High throughput sequencing technologies have allowed the fast and cost-effective generation of genetic information of interest to understand different biological aspects of non-model organisms as well as the identification of potential pathogens. Using these technologies, we have obtained and characterized the transcriptome of T. pityocampa larvae collected in 12 different geographical locations in Turkey. cDNA libraries for Illumina sequencing were prepared from four larval tissues, head, <b>gut,</b> <b>fat</b> body and integument.

40|$|Flavescence dorée (FD) is a grapevine {{disease that}} afflicts several wine {{production}} areas in Europe, from Portugal to Serbia. FD {{is caused by}} a bacterium, “Candidatus Phytoplasma vitis,” which is spread throughout the vineyards by a leafhopper, Scaphoideus titanus (Cicadellidae). After collection of S. titanus specimens from FD-contaminated vineyards in three different areas in the Piedmont region of Italy, we performed a survey to characterize the bacterial microflora associated with this insect. Using length heterogeneity PCR with universal primers for bacteria we identified a major peak associated with almost all of the individuals examined (both males and females). Characterization by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis confirmed the presence of a major band that, after sequencing, showed a 97 to 99 % identity with Bacteroidetes symbionts of the “Candidatus Cardinium hertigii” group. In addition, electron microscopy of tissues of S. titanus fed for 3 months on phytoplasma-infected grapevine plants showed bacterial cells with the typical morphology of “Ca.

Here, we examine if increased levels of an IGFBP-like protein can extend lifespan, using Drosophila as the model organism. We demonstrate that Imaginal morphogenesis protein-Late 2 (IMP-L 2), a secreted protein and the fly homologue of the human IGFBP 7 tumour suppressor, is capable of binding {{at least two of}} the seven Drosophila insulin-like peptides (DILPs), namely native DILP 2 and DILP 5 as present in the adult fly. Increased expression of Imp-L 2 results in phenotypic changes in the adult consistent with down-regulation of IIS, including accumulation of eIF- 4 E binding protein mRNA, increase in storage lipids, reduced fecundity and enhanced oxidative stress resistance. Increased Imp-L 2 results in up-regulation of dilp 2, dilp 3 and dilp 5 mRNA, revealing a feedback circuit that is mediated via the fly <b>gut</b> and/or <b>fat</b> body. Importantly, over-expression of Imp-L 2, ubiquitous or restricted to DILP-producing cells or <b>gut</b> and <b>fat</b> body, extends lifespan.

40|$|Chitin synthases are {{critical}} enzymes for synthesis of chitin and thus for subsequent {{growth and development}} in insects. We identified the cDNA of chitin synthase gene (CHS) in Aphis glycines, the soybean aphid, which is a serious pest of soybean. The full-length cDNA of CHS in A. glycines (AyCHS) was 5802 bp long with an open reading frame of 4704 bp that encoded for a 1567 amino acid residues protein. The predicted AyCHS protein had a molecular mass of 180. 05 kDa and its amino acid sequence contained all the signature motifs (EDR, QRRRW and TWGTR) of chitin synthases. The quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed that AyCHS was expressed in all major tissues (<b>gut,</b> <b>fat</b> body and integument); however, it had the highest expression in integument (&# 126; 3. 5 fold compared to gut). Interestingly, the expression of AyCHS in developing embryos was nearly 7 fold higher compared to adult integument, which probably {{is a reflection of}} embryonic molts in hemimetabolus insects. Expression analysis in different developmental stages of A. glycines revealed a consistent AyCHS expression in all stages. Further, through leaf dip bioassay, we tested the effect of diflubenzuron (DFB, Dimilin &# 174;), a chitin-synthesis inhibitor, on A. glycines ' survival, fecundity and body weight. When fed with soybean leaves previously dipped in 50 ppm DFB solution, A. glycines nymphs suffered significantly higher mortality compared to control.

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} carried out at Siwa Research Station which {{belonging}} to Desert Research Center, Egypt, {{to determine the effects}} of weaning age on growth performance, feed intake and carcass characteristics. A total of 28 newborn male Barki lambs were used for 240 days. Lambs were divided into two equal groups (14 lambs of each) and weaned either at 60 (early weaning, EW, with birth weight of 4. 12 ± 0. 14 kg and served as treated group) or at 120 days of age (late weaning, LW, with birth weight of 4. 11 ± 0. 10 kg and served as control group). At 4 months of age, all lambs (control and treated groups) put in a 4 months fattening period. At the end of fattening period, eight rams of each weaning age (EW and LW) were randomly selected and slaughtered to assess carcass characteristics. In addition, weights of all internal fat depots: heart fat, kidneys fat and <b>gut</b> <b>fat</b> (the fatty tissue surrounding the alimentary tract) were removed and weighed separately. The results indicated that, early weaned lambs had a highly (P< 0. 01) significant effect on LBW and had higher th values of ADG and GR at the beginning of the 6 month up to the end of experimental period compared with late weaned lambs. The results revealed that EW lambs had superior (P< 0. 01) carcass weight (7. 44 %) and tailed hot carcass weight (20. 04 %). All internal organs (liver, kidneys, heart, spleen, lung with trachea and testis) weights were approximately similar and did not significantly different between EW and LW lambs. Therefore, the results showed no differences due to weaning age on weights of internal organs.

40|$|Signaling by the Transforming Growth Factor-Beta; (TGF-Beta) {{superfamily}} {{is essential}} for many cellular processes and is required throughout the life of many organisms. TGF-Beta; signaling triggers distinct developmental programs and cellular processes, thus disruption of the pathway is associated with defects in development and growth of the organism. Signaling specificity is achieved {{through the use of}} distinct pathway components and combinatorial action with other cell signaling pathways. The main goal of my thesis project was to understand the roles of two ligands of the TGF-Beta; superfamily, Maverick (Mav) and Myoglianin (Myo), and their mechanism of action in Drosophila. We first characterized several mutant alleles for mav and myo that were previously generated in the lab. Next, we investigated the role of mav at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Loss-of-function analysis suggests that mav has no affect on growth of the NMJ. However, ectopic expression of mav in glial cells does have an affect on the NMJ, suggesting that while not essential, NMJ growth may be sensitive to changes in levels of Mav. Phenotypic analysis of mutations in myo that encodes an activin ligand, revealed a wide range of metamorphosis phenotypes reminiscent of loss of the steroid hormone ecdysone. We investigated the role of myo in several tissues that undergo specific changes during metamorphosis. We determined that myo is selectively required for expression of the ecdysone receptor EcR-B 1 isoform in a diverse group of neurons in the central nervous system, but not in other EcR-B 1 expressing tissues, for example <b>gut,</b> <b>fat</b> body and salivary glands. Therefore one of the roles of Myo is to regulate the ability of specific cells to respond to ecdysone. Importantly, we found that salivary gland destruction in response to ecdysone signaling is dependent on activin signaling, but this occurs through regulation of EcR-B 1 in specific cells in the brain, rather than in the salivary gland itself. Our data argue for a model in which ecdysone signaling utilizes both direct and indirect inputs to coordinate salivary gland destruction during pupal metamorphosis. The work presented here provides insights into the requirement of Myo/activin signaling in regulation and coordination of steroid dependent biological processes in animals...|$|E

Interestingly, homozygous Pdp 1 p 205 embryos develop normally, hatch and become viable larvae. Analyses of Pdp 1 null mutant embryos reveal that the overall muscle pattern is normal as is the patterning of the <b>gut</b> and <b>fat</b> body. Pdp 1 p 205 larvae also appear to have normal muscle and gut function and respond to ecdysone. These larvae, however, are severely growth delayed and arrested.

The stunted growth of Pdp 1 p 205 larvae is accompanied by defects in mitosis and endoreplication similar to that associated with nutritional deprivation. The cellular defects resulting from the Pdp 1 p 205 mutation are not cell autonomous. Moreover, PDP 1 expression is sensitive to nutritional conditions, suggesting a link between nutrition, PDP 1 isotype expression and growth. These results indicate that Pdp 1 has a critical role in coordinating growth and DNA replication...|$|R

At 17, 5 kg slaughter weight, Priangan (17600 ± 89 g) produced 47. 10 % carcass, 11. 14 % head and shank, 6. 67 % skin, 14. 38 % offals, 4. 84 % blood and 12. 71 % <b>gut</b> content; <b>Fat</b> Tail (17490 ± 20 g) produced 48. 76 % carcass, 9. 20 % head and shank, 7. 00 % skin, 13. 38 % offals, 4. 08 % blood and 11. 99 % gut content. At 25. 0 kg slaughter weight, Priangan (24917 ± 183 g) produced 48. 70 % carcass, 10. 14 % head and shank, 6. 90 % skin, 12. 90 offals, 5. 03 % blood and 12. 12 % <b>gut</b> content. <b>Fat</b> Tail produced 52. 39 % carcass, 8. 39 % head and shank, 7. 00 % skin, 13. 11 % offals, 4. 19 % blood and 10. 61 % gut content...|$|R
40|$|In the {{physiological}} state {{a multitude of}} gut hormones are released into the circulation {{at the same time}} depending on {{the quality and quantity of}} the diet. These hormones interact with receptors at various points in the “gut-brain axis” to affect short-term and intermediate-term feelings of hunger and satiety. The combined effects of macronutrients on the predominant gut hormone secretion are still poorly understood. Besides, adipokines form an important part of an “adipoinsular axis” dysregulation which may contribute to β-cell failure and hence to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). Even more, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and T 2 DM seem to share a genetic basis. In susceptible individuals, chronic exaggerated stimulation of the proximal <b>gut</b> with <b>fat</b> and carbohydrates may induce overproduction of an unknown factor that causes impairment of incretin production and/or action, leading to insufficient or untimely production of insulin, so that glucose intolerance develops. The bypass of the duodenum and jejunum might avoid a putative hormone overproduction in the proximal foregut in diabetic patients that might counteract the action of insulin, while the early presentation of undigested or incompletely digested food to the ileum may anticipate the production of hormones such as GLP 1, further improving insulin action...|$|R
40|$|The ileal brake is an intraluminal nutrient-triggered {{feedback}} control from the distal to the proximal <b>gut</b> with <b>fat</b> {{being the most}} potent trigger. Peptide YY (PYY) {{is one of the}} hormonal mediators of the ileal brake. Effects of the fat induced ileal brake on proximal small intestine, postprandial gallbladder motility and hormone release are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those evoked by the fat induced jejunal brake. Activation of the ileal brake reduces gallbladder emptying especially in the late postprandial phase. It not clear wherether this action is hormonally mediated through PYY release. Ileal brake induced satiety and proximal gastric relaxation are not mediated through PYY release. In order to produce a significant effect on satiety and food intake the dose of exogenous PYY infusion must probably be in the supraphysiological range. Activation of the ileal brake with subsequent PYY release in malabsorptive diseases is most likely secondary, resulting from malabsorption rather than primarily due to the underlying disease. The findings that laxative induced malabsorption activates the ileal brake mechanism in healthy subjects and that pancreatic enzyme supplementation normalises antroduodenal motility and postprandial plasma PYY secretion in chronic pancreatitic patients with exocrine pancreatic secretion are clear evidence supporting this concept.

40|$|AbstractA bioinformatics-based {{investigation}} of three insect species with completed genome sequences {{has revealed that}} insect chitinase-like proteins (glycosylhydrolase family 18) are encoded by a rather large and diverse group of genes. We identified 16, 16 and 13 putative chitinase-like genes in the genomic databases of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, respectively. Chitinase-like proteins encoded by this gene family were classified into five groups based on phylogenetic analyses. Group I chitinases are secreted proteins that are the most abundant such enzymes in molting fluid and/or integument, and represent the prototype enzyme of the family, with a single copy each of the catalytic domain and chitin-binding domain (ChBD) connected by an S/T-rich linker polypeptide. Group II chitinases are unusually larger-sized secreted proteins that contain multiple catalytic domains and ChBDs. Group III chitinases contain two catalytic domains and are predicted to be membrane-anchored proteins. Group IV chitinases are the most divergent. They usually lack a ChBD and/or an S/T-rich linker domain, and are known or predicted to be secreted proteins found in <b>gut</b> or <b>fat</b> body. Group V proteins include the putative chitinase-like imaginal disc growth factors (IDGFs). In {{each of the three}} insect genomes, multiple genes encode group IV and group V chitinase-like proteins. In contrast, groups I–III are each represented by only a singe gene in each species...|$|R
40|$|We have {{identified}} genes regulated by starvation and sugar signals in Drosophila larvae using whole-genome microarrays. Based on expression profiles {{in the two}} nutrient conditions, they were organized into different categories that reflect distinct physiological pathways mediating sugar and fat metabolism, and cell growth. In the category of genes regulated in sugar-fed, but not in starved, animals, there is an upregulation of genes encoding key enzymes of the fat biosynthesis pathway and a downregulation of genes encoding lipases. The highest and earliest activated gene upon sugar ingestion is sugarbabe, a zinc finger protein that is induced in the <b>gut</b> and the <b>fat</b> body. Identification of potential targets using microarrays suggests that sugarbabe functions to repress genes involved in dietary fat breakdown and absorption. The current analysis provides a basis for studying the genetic mechanisms underlying nutrient signalling...|$|R
