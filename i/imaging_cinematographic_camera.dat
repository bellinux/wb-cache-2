Though there is a range of techniques to automatically control drones for a variety of applications, none have considered the problem of producing <b>cinematographic</b> <b>camera</b> motion in real-time for shooting purposes. In this paper we present our approach to UAV navigation for autonomous cinematography. The contributions of this research are twofold: (i) we adapt virtual camera control techniques to UAV navigation; (ii) we introduce a drone-independent platform for high-level user interactions that integrates cinematographic knowledge. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the capacities of our tool to capture live movie scenes involving one or two moving actors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{introduce}} a cinematographic video production system to create movie-like attractive footage from our indoor daily life. Since {{the system is}} designed for ordinary users in non-studio environments, it is composed of standard hardware components, provides a simple interface, and works in near real-time of 5 ~ 6 frames/sec. The proposed system reconstructs a visual hull from acquired multiple videos and then generates final videos from the model by referring to the camera shots used in film-making. The proposed method utilizes “Reliability ” to compensate for errors that may have occurred in non-studio environments and to produce the most natural scene from the reconstructed model. By using a virtual camera control system, even non-experts can easily convert the 3 D model to movies that {{look as if they}} were created by experienced filmmakers. Keywords 3 D video system.

5000|$|Of {{the many}} {{attempts}} to produce cinematograph pictures... {{the greatest amount}} of attention so far has been attracted by a system invented by George Albert Smith, and commercially developed by Charles Urban under the name of [...] "Kinemacolor." [...] In this system (to quote from Cassell's Cyclopædia of Photography, edited by the editor of this present book), only two colour filters are used in taking the negatives and only two in projecting the positives. The camera resembles the ordinary <b>cinematographic</b> <b>camera</b> except that it runs at twice the speed, taking thirty-two images per second instead of sixteen, and it is fitted with a rotating colour filter in addition to the ordinary shutter. This filter is an aluminium skeleton wheel... having four segments, two open ones, G and H; one filled in with red-dyed gelatine, E F; and the fourth containing green-dyed gelatine, A B. The camera is so geared that exposures are made alternately through the red gelatine and the green gelatine. Panchromatic film is used, and the negative is printed from in the ordinary way, and it will be understood that there is no colour in the film itself.|$|R
500|$|Kamitani {{acted as}} art and {{character}} designer for the game, with additional art for {{elements such as}} food provided by Shigatake. So as to distance the appearance of Gwyndolin and other Valkyries in Odin Sphere from the Valkyries of the Valkyrie Profile series, Kamitani modeled their outfits after ballet tutus. The character Mercedes was a fairy version of Gradriel De Valendia, the main protagonist of Princess Crown. Velvet's design was described as an [...] "Arabic Little Red Riding Hood". More sensual elements of his female character designs came about through chance rather than deliberate design. Despite the general move to 3D graphics in the gaming industry, the team decided to use 2D graphics, as Kamitani felt the style was stagnating. The use of 2D graphics meant that traditional <b>cinematographic</b> <b>camera</b> work for cutscenes was impossible to achieve, so the team instead modeled them after scenes from a stage production. This style was also chosen due to the story's Shakespearean atmosphere. The character graphics were hand-drawn in a process Kamitani dubbed [...] "tebineri", or hand-shaping. The toolset used to create the graphic animations was heavily inspired by the similar animation style used for Adobe Flash products. An element that proved troublesome was character movement, which was hard to make behave within the limited hardware specifications of the PS2. A cited example was how Velvet's breasts giggle slightly when she stops moving. This was intended for more female characters, but due to the hardware limitations it was restricted to Velvet.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{effectiveness}} of a <b>cinematographic</b> <b>camera</b> for controlling 3 D video by measuring its effects on viewers with several typical camera works. 3 D free-viewpoint video allows us to set its virtual camera on arbitrary positions and postures in 3 D space. However, there have been neither investigations on adaptability nor on dependencies between the camera parameters of the virtual camera (i. e., positions, postures, and transitions) nor the impressions of viewers. Although camera works on 3 D video based on expertise seems important for making intuitively understandable video, it has not yet been considered. When applying camera works to 3 D video using the planning techniques proposed in previous research, generating ideal output video is difficult because it may include defects due to image resolution limitation, calculation errors, or occlusions as well as others caused by positioning errors of the virtual camera in the planning process. Therefore, we conducted an experiment with 29 subjects with camera-worked 3 D videos created using simple annotation and planning techniques to determine the virtual camera parameters. The first point of the experiment examines the effects of defects on viewer impressions. To measure such impressions, we conducted a semantic differential (SD) test. Comparisons between ground truth and 3 D videos with planned camera works show that the present defects of camera work do not significantly affect viewers. The experiment 2 ̆ 7 s second point examines whether the cameras controlled by planning and annotations affected the subjects with intentional direction. For this purpose, we conducted a factor analysis for the SD test answers whose results indicate that the proposed virtual camera control, which exploits annotation and planning techniques, allows us to realize camera working direction on 3 D video...|$|R
5000|$|Cinema {{was only}} five years old {{when it came to}} Fati Persia at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. Nimaa Loved Fateme and The first Persian filmmaker was Mirza Ebrahim Khan Akkas Bashi, the official photographer of Muzaffar al-Din Shah, the King of Persia from 1896 - 1907. After a visit to Paris in July 1900, Akkas Bashi obtained a camera and filmed the Shah's visit to Europe upon the Shah's orders. He is said to have filmed the Shah's private and religious ceremonies, but no copies of such films exist today. A few years after Akkas Bashi started photography, Khan Baba Motazedi, another pioneer in Iranian motion picture photography emerged. He shot a considerable amount of newsreel footage during the reign of Qajar to the Pahlavi dynasty.The first public screening took place in Tehran in 1904, presented by Mirza Ebrahim Khan Sahaf Bashi. He arranged the screening in the back of his antique shop. In 1905, Sahaf Bashi opened the first movie theater in Cheragh Gaz Avenue in the national capital.In 1909, with fall of the Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar heir of Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar and the success of the constitutionalists, Russi Khan lost his support. Consequently, his film theatre and photography studios were destroyed by the public. Soon after, other cinema theatres in Tehran closed down. Movie theatres sprang up again in 1912 with the help of Ardeshir Khan an Armenian -Iranian. In 1925, Ovanes Ohanian decided to establish the first film school in Iran.In 1904, Mirza Ebrahim Khan Sahhafbashi opened the first movie theater in Tehran. The <b>cinematographic</b> <b>camera</b> was introduced to Iran in 1929, as yet another tool of modernization. After Mirza Ebrahim Khan, several others like Russi Khan, Ardeshir Khan, and Ali Vakili tried to establish new movie theaters in Tehran. Until the early 1930s, there were little more than 15 theatres in Tehran and 11 in other provinces. In 1925, Ovanes Ohanian, decided to establish the first film school in Iran. Within five years he managed to run the first session of the school under the name [...] "Parvareshgahe Artistiye Cinema".|$|R
40|$|Background: Birdsong {{and human}} vocal {{communication}} are both complex behaviours which show striking similarities mainly {{thought to be}} present in the area of development and learning. Recent studies, however, suggest that there are also parallels in vocal production mechanisms. While it has been long thought that vocal tract filtering, as it occurs in human speech, only plays a minor role in birdsong there is an increasing number of studies indicating the presence of sound filtering mechanisms in bird vocalizations as well. Methodology/Principal Findings: Correlating high-speed X-ray <b>cinematographic</b> <b>imaging</b> of singing zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to song structures we identified beak gape and the expansion of the oropharyngeal-esophageal cavity (OEC) as potential articulators. We subsequently manipulated both structures in an experiment in which we played sound through the vocal tract of dead birds. Comparing acoustic input with acoustic output showed that OEC expansion causes an energy shift towards lower frequencies and an amplitude increase whereas a wide beak gape emphasizes frequencies around 5 kilohertz and above. Conclusion: These findings confirm that birds can modulate their song by using vocal tract filtering and demonstrate ho...|$|R
