500|$|With 54,288 total entries and a {{combined}} prize pool of $159,796,918, the 2007 WSOP {{was the largest}} series of poker tournaments ever. [...] For many, winning {{a share of the}} prize pool was all that mattered, while others sought the glory associated with winning a bracelet. [...] This dichotomy could not have been illustrated better than a deal negotiated at the Senior Championship event. Tony Korfman wanted the money while Ernest Bennett wanted the glory. [...] Rather than leave their fates to chance, the two of them ensured they got what they wanted. In exchange for splitting the prize money, Korfman agreed to let Bennett win the bracelet. [...] After winning $8.25million in the Main Event, Jerry Yang and his wife retired. [...] "My winning today also means a lot to me, because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can use this money {{to do a lot of}} good for other people out there," [...] Yang said before donating over a million dollars to charity.

The single opens with the lyrics, [...] "Take a breath/ Take it deep/ Calm yourself/ He says to me/ If you play/ You play for keeps/ Take the gun/ And count to three."

[...] In the upcoming verse, the character that the singer portrays in the song it's scared that the man talking to her will always have a power over, [...] "Say a prayer to yourself/ He says close your eyes/ Sometimes it helps/ And then I get a scary thought/ That he's here means he's never lost." [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] ends with a sound of a gun shot, which according to Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V.

500|$|The song, {{which was}} the last one written for the album, was placed {{at the end of the}} album because it [...] "marks a new beginning" [...] for the band, {{which was the}} theme on the album and a theme in Lee's life. In the booklet of The Open Door, she stated that her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler, was the main {{inspiration}} for the song. In the booklet she wrote, [...] "Josh, you are my muse. Nothing inspires me the way you do. Thank you for all my missing pieces. Thank you for your strength and love. Thank you for letting me see myself through your eyes, because only then could <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am good enough for you." [...] One of the band's previous singles, [...] "Bring Me to Life", was also written about Josh Hartzler. In an interview with VH1, Lee further revealed the inspiration behind the song, saying [...] "I had gone through a lot of difficult things during the writing of the whole album, and by the end of it, I had stepped away from those bad situations. That's really hard. You have to be really brave and strong about it. After doing that, I felt so amazing. For the first time I felt like I could write a song based on how good I felt. I have never done that before ever. During another interview with The Washington Post she stated: ...|$|E

Blatt discussed the reunion's failure in an interview with i-D magazine in 2012: [...] "I don't think it was done for the right reasons... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did it for the money.

2500|$|Rabbi Abbahu said in Rabbi Eleazar's {{name that}} [...] "his trained men" [...] in [...] meant Torah scholars, and thus when Abram made them fight to rescue Lot, he brought {{punishment}} on {{himself and his}} children, who were consequently enslaved in Egyptian for 210 years. But Samuel said that Abram was punished because he questioned whether God would keep God's promise, when in [...] Abram asked God [...] "how shall <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall inherit it?" [...] And Rabbi Johanan said that Abram was punished because he prevented people from entering beneath {{the wings of the}} Shekhinah and being saved, when in [...] the king of Sodom said it to Abram, [...] "Give me the persons, and take the goods yourself," [...] and Abram consented to leave the prisoners with the king of Sodom. Rav interpreted the words [...] "And he armed his trained servants, born in his own house" [...] in [...] to mean that Abram equipped them by teaching them the Torah. Samuel read the word vayarek ("he armed") to mean [...] "bright," [...] and thus interpreted the words [...] "And he armed his trained servants" [...] in [...] to mean that Abram made them bright with gold, that is, rewarded them for accompanying him.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Jacob bar Aha said in {{the name}} of Rav Assi that Abraham asked God whether God would wipe out Abraham's {{descendants}} as God had destroyed the generation of the Flood. Rabbi Jacob bar Aha {{said in the}} name of Rav Assi that Abraham's question in [...] "O Lord God, how shall <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall inherit it?" [...] {{was part of a larger}} dialogue. Abraham asked God if Abraham's descendants should sin before God, would God do to them as God did to the generation of the Flood (in [...] ) and the generation of the Dispersion (in Genesis in [...] ). God told Abraham that God would not. Abraham then asked God (as reported in [...] ), [...] "Let me know how I shall inherit it." [...] God answered by instructing Abraham (as reported in [...] ), [...] "Take Me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old" [...] (which Abraham was to sacrifice to God). Abraham acknowledged to God that this means of atonement through sacrifice would hold good while a sacrificial shrine remained in being, but Abraham pressed God what would become of his descendants when the Temple would no longer exist. God replied that God had already long ago provided for Abraham's descendants in the Torah the order of the sacrifices, and whenever they read it, God would deem it as if they had offered them before God, and God would grant them pardon for all their iniquities. Rabbi Jacob bar Aha said {{in the name of}} Rav Assi that this demonstrated that were it not for the , Ma'amadot, groups of lay Israelites who participated in worship as representatives of the public, then heaven and earth could not endure..
