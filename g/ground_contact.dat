5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> point trails behind the steering axis <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E
5|$|When landing, {{wind shear}} {{is also a}} hazard, {{particularly}} when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to <b>ground</b> <b>contact.</b> The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E
5|$|Free flight {{lasted for}} 10 hours and 29 minutes and was {{followed}} by another 41 hours of bumpy ride with frequent <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> before the inevitable final crash. The Eagle traveled for 2 days and 3½ hours altogether, during which time, according to Andrée, {{none of the three}} men got any sleep. The definitive landing appears to have been gentle. Neither the men nor the homing pigeons in their wicker cages were hurt, and none of the equipment was damaged, not even the delicate optical instruments and Strindberg's two cameras.|$|E

5|$|The rider applies {{torque to}} the {{handlebars}} {{in order to}} turn the front wheel and so to control lean and maintain balance. At high speeds, small steering angles quickly move the <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> points laterally; at low speeds, larger steering angles are required {{to achieve the same}} results in the same amount of time. Because of this, it is usually easier to maintain balance at high speeds. As self-stability typically occurs at speeds above a certain threshold, going faster increases the chances that a bike is contributing to its own stability.|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> points of {{the front and rear}} wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E
5|$|A termite nest can be {{considered}} as being composed of two parts, the inanimate and the animate. The animate is all of the termites living inside the colony, and the inanimate part is the structure itself, which is constructed by the termites. Nests can be broadly separated into three main categories: subterranean (completely below ground), epigeal (protruding above the soil surface), and arboreal (built above ground, but always connected to the ground via shelter tubes). Epigeal nests (mounds) protrude from the earth with <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> and are made out of earth and mud. A nest has many functions such as providing a protected living space and providing shelter against predators. Most termites construct underground colonies rather than multifunctional nests and mounds. Primitive termites of today nest in wooden structures such as logs, stumps and the dead parts of trees, as did termites millions of years ago.|$|E

The paper describes the results obtained with a new sensor for measuring the exact timing of trawl <b>ground</b> gear bottom <b>contact</b> and departure, as well as monitoring of the <b>ground</b> gear <b>contact</b> during the haul. Measured towed duration with the new system is compared with the traditional survey measures of this parameter on a number of hauls, and the results are discussed with respect to survey bias...|$|R

This enables the spacecraft to perform many functions autonomously that previously could only be planned and carried out from the ground. In some cases, this increased computing power is required to perform functions that {{must be carried out}} on the spacecraft.

40|$|Dynamically {{simulated}} {{characters are}} difficult to control because they are underactuated—they have no direct control over their global position and orientation. In order to succeed, control policies must look ahead to determine stabilizing actions, but such planning is complicated by frequent <b>ground</b> <b>contacts</b> that produce a discontinuous search space. This paper introduces a locomotion system that generates high-quality animation of agile movements using nonlinear controllers that plan through such contact changes. We demonstrate the general applicability of this approach by emulating walking and running motions in rigid-body simulations. Then we consolidate these controllers under a higher-level planner that interactively controls the character’s direction...|$|R
5|$|Wind figures {{prominently}} in several popular sports, including recreational hang gliding, hot air ballooning, kite flying, snowkiting, kite landboarding, kite surfing, paragliding, sailing, and windsurfing. In gliding, wind gradients {{just above the}} surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider. Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed {{to deal with the}} effect of the gradient. When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to <b>ground</b> <b>contact.</b> The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E
25|$|Thus, the {{specialised}} cornified {{structures of}} the hoof are the wall, the sole, the frog and periople. The wall does not exfoliate at all; it is constantly growing downward (about 1cm per month), and self-trims by wearing or chipping by <b>ground</b> <b>contact,</b> in wild and feral horses. Solar, frog and periople material grow outwards and exfoliate at the surface by <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> and wearing. In the domesticated horse, movement and typical ground hardness are insufficient to allow self-trimming, so humans have to care for them, trimming {{the walls and the}} frog, and scraping off the dead sole.|$|E

25|$|Wheelbase is the {{horizontal}} {{distance between the}} centers (or the <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> points) of {{the front and rear}} wheels. Wheelbase is a function of rear frame length, steering axis angle, and fork offset. It is similar to the term wheelbase used for automobiles and trains.|$|E
25|$|This countersteering to {{the right}} causes the <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> to move {{to the right}} of the center of mass, as the bike moves forward, thus {{generating}} a leftward lean. Finally the front end steers to the left and the bike enters the left turn.|$|E

5000|$|A two-mass-skate bicycle (TMS) is a {{theoretical}} model {{created by a}} team of researchers at Cornell University, University of Wisconsin-Stout, and Delft University of Technology to show that it is neither sufficient nor necessary for a bike to have gyroscopic effects or positive trail to be self-stable. [...] The two-mass and skates aspects of the model were chosen to eliminate design parameters so that the nine that remain, the locations of the masses and the steering geometry, could be more easily analyzed. Instead of full inertia tensors, the total mass of the bike is reduced to just two point masses, one attached to the rear frame and one attached to the front fork. Instead of rotating wheels, the non-holonomic <b>ground</b> <b>contacts</b> are provided by small-radius skates.|$|R

25|$|All of the {{evidence}} allegedly supporting alternative theories is discussed in the 2013 report of Maciej Lasek commission.

25|$|Trail, or caster, is the {{horizontal}} distance {{from where the}} front wheel touches the ground to where the steering axis intersects the ground. The measurement is considered positive if the front wheel <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> point is behind (towards {{the rear of the}} bike) the steering axis intersection with the ground.

40|$|A hybrid genetic {{algorithm}} {{is used to}} schedule tasks for 8 satellites, which can be modelled as a robot whose task is to retrieve objects from a two dimensional field. The objective {{is to find a}} schedule that maximizes the value of objects retrieved. Typical of the real-world tasks to which this corresponds is the scheduling of <b>ground</b> <b>contacts</b> for a communications satellite. An important feature of our application is that the amount of time available for running the scheduler is not necessarily known in advance. This requires that the scheduler produce reasonably good results after a short period but that it also continue to improve its results if allowed to run for a longer period. We satisfy this requirement by developing what we call a sustainable {{genetic algorithm}}...|$|R

25|$|Trail {{can vary}} as the bike leans or steers. In {{the case of}} {{traditional}} geometry, trail decreases (and wheelbase increases if measuring distance between <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> points and not hubs) as the bike leans and steers {{in the direction of}} the lean. Trail can also vary as the suspension activates, in response to braking for example. As telescopic forks compress due to load transfer during braking, the trail and the wheelbase both decrease. At least one motorcycle, the MotoCzysz C1, has a fork with adjustable trail, from 89mm to 101mm.|$|E

25|$|The horse hoof {{is not at}} all a rigid structure. It is elastic and flexible. Just {{squeezing}} the heels by hand will demonstrate that. When loaded, the hoof physiologically changes its shape. In part, this is a result of solar concavity, which has a variable depth, in the region of 1–1.5cm. In part, it {{is a result of the}} arched shape of the lateral lower profile of the walls and sole, so that when an unloaded hoof touches a firm ground surface, there is only contact at toe and heels (active contact). A loaded hoof has a much greater area of <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> (passive contact), covering the lower wall edge, most of the sole, bars and frog. Active contact areas can be seen as slightly protruding spots in the walls and in the callused sole.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} a state estimation framework for legged robots that allows estimating the full pose of the robot without making any {{assumptions about the}} geometrical structure of its environment. This is achieved {{by means of an}} Observability Constrained Extended Kalman Filter that fuses kinematic encoder data with on-board IMU measurements. By including the absolute position of all footholds into the filter state, simple model equations can be formulated which accurately capture the uncertainties associated with the intermittent <b>ground</b> <b>contacts.</b> The resulting filter simultaneously estimates the position of all footholds and the pose of the main body. In the algorithmic formulation, special attention is paid to the consistency of the linearized filter: it maintains the same observability properties as the nonlinear system, which is a prerequisite for accurate state estimation. The presented approach is implemented in simulation and validated experimentally on an actual quadrupedal robot. I...|$|R
5|$|If {{the bike}} and rider are {{considered}} to be a single system, the forces that act on that system and its components can be roughly divided into two groups: internal and external. The external forces are due to gravity, inertia, <b>contact</b> with the <b>ground,</b> and <b>contact</b> with the atmosphere. The internal forces are caused by the rider and by interaction between components.|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} {{high-speed}} motion CCD video cameras allowed {{the use of}} temporal highresolution video images of lightning flashes. High-speed cameras are now an essential tool in lightning research. Being able to see and analyze sequential, time resolved images of lightning processes is greatly improving our understanding of this complex phenomenon. Flash characteristics like stroke multiplicity, interstroke time interval, flash duration, number of <b>ground</b> <b>contacts</b> are easily determined. With these cameras, the missing of strokes that occur at relatively short time intervals is practically excluded. The presence of continuing current events, the waveshape of their intensity and the occurrence of M components can be observed. Also, the elapsed time since the return stroke and time interval between successive M components can be measured. In addition, recoil leaders that retrace fine branch structures during the propagation of positive leaders to ground were observed {{for the first time}} with these cameras. This review paper will describe some recent findings obtained with high-speed videos...|$|R
