50|$|COC is {{commonly}} extruded with cast or blown film {{equipment in the}} manufacture of packaging films. Most often, due to cost, COC is used as a modifier in monolayer or multilayer film to provide properties not delivered by base resins such as polyethylene. Grades of COC based on ethylene show a certain amount of compatibility with polyethylene and can be blended with PE via commercial dry blending equipment. These films are then used in consumer applications including food and healthcare packaging. Key COC enhancements can include thermoformability, shrink, <b>deadfold,</b> easy tear, enhanced stiffness, heat resistance and higher moisture barrier. Common applications include shrink films and labels, twist films, protective or bubble packaging, and forming films. Another noted application which often relies on a high percentage of COC in the end product is pharmaceutical blister packaging.|$|E
