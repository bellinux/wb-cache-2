25|$|In early 1975 the merged group began rehearsing for In Praise of Learning in a {{freezing}} gymnasium. It was {{an arduous}} and extremely demanding time, something Slapp Happy {{were not prepared}} for, and it soon {{became apparent that the}} merger might not work. Nevertheless, they still went to The Manor and made In Praise of Learning together. But it was only after they started rehearsing with a view to performing live together that it became clear that their approaches were incompatible. The merger ended in April 1975, when Anthony Moore quit and Peter Blegvad was asked to leave. However, Dagmar Krause, whose contribution had added another dimension to Henry Cow's sound, elected to remain, which effectively spelled the end of Slapp <b>Happy</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> band.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the show (roughly 8 years), Monk overcomes many of his phobias and some aspects of his OCD. Though he hasn't been cured of many of them, if any at all, {{he has been able to}} put them in the back of his mind when {{involved}} in case work. His most notable breakthrough is shown in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to Group Therapy", when Adrian is locked in a car trunk with his fellow OCD patient and personal rival, Harold Krenshaw. During the terrifying trip, both men overcome their longstanding case of claustrophobia (fear of small spaces), as well as their own differences, resulting in them becoming friends. Possibly due to this, as well as the many cases Monk has solved over the years, he is reinstated as detective first class by Stottlemeyer in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the Badge". Though he is very excited about his reinstatement initially, Monk realizes that becoming a detective again didn't mean that he would be happier. In a session with Dr. Bell, Monk realizes he was always <b>happy</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> private detective and consultant to the SFPD as his own boss. After overcoming his fear of heights and singlehandedly capturing a killer window-washer, Monk turns in his badge. In the series finale, he learns that his late wife, Trudy, had given birth to a daughter before they had met. The knowledge and events of the episode lead to positive changes in his personality.|$|E

2500|$|Nogradi won the Janikovszky-Eva {{award in}} 2003, {{but he has}} never {{received}} any national awards. As he says, [...] "They look at me as an outsider, {{because the people who}} give the awards in our country do not fully understand what I have been trying to accomplish with my work and my projects. Fortunately, my readers, the children (and their parents) do, so as long as they love and read my books, I am <b>happy.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> famous Hungarian poet, Sandor Weöres, once said, a writer, if he is any good, must live a sort of life that the powers that be do not even consider him for an award.... I agree." ...|$|E
2500|$|The merged group {{returned}} to the studio in early 1975 to record Henry Cow's In Praise of Learning (as [...] "Henry Cow/Slapp Happy"). The only real contribution from Slapp Happy (besides Dagmar's singing) was the Moore/Blegvad song [...] "War", which blended in well with the album's political aggression. But differences in approach {{between the two groups}} had come to a head in April 1975 and Anthony Moore and Peter Blegvad quit, suggesting that Henry Cow's music was too serious (and political) for their liking. Dagmar Krause, however, elected to remain with Henry Cow, who needed a vocalist. This effectively spelt the end of Slapp <b>Happy</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> band. Slapp Happy did, however, record one more single, [...] "Johnny's Dead", without Krause, which was released in July 1975.|$|E
2500|$|The {{show was}} {{noted for its}} minimalist set, where LaLanne {{inspired}} his viewers to use basic home objects, such as a chair, to perform their exercises along with him. Wearing his standard jumpsuit, he urged his audience [...] "with the enthusiasm of an evangelist," [...] to get off their couch and copy his basic movements, a manner considered the forerunner of today's fitness videos. In 1959, LaLanne recorded Glamour Stretcher Time, a workout album which provided phonograph-based instruction for exercising with an elastic cord called the Glamour Stretcher. [...] As a daytime show, much of LaLanne's audience were stay-at-home mothers. [...] Wife Elaine LaLanne {{was part of the}} show to demonstrate the exercises, as well as the fact that doing them would not ruin their figures or musculature. [...] LaLanne also included his dog <b>Happy</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way to attract children to the show. [...] Later in the run, another dog named Walter was used, with LaLanne claiming [...] "Walter" [...] stood for [...] "We All Love To Exercise Regularly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Raimi {{sifted through}} the {{previous}} drafts by Gough, Millar, Koepp and Chabon, picking what he liked with screenwriter Alvin Sargent. He felt that thematically the film had to explore Peter's conflict with his personal wants against his responsibility, exploring {{the positive and}} negatives of his chosen path, and how he ultimately decides {{that he can be}} <b>happy</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> heroic figure. Raimi stated the story was partly influenced by Superman II, which also explored the titular hero giving up his responsibilities. The story is mainly taken from The Amazing Spider-Man No. 50, [...] "Spider-Man No More!" [...] It was decided that Doctor Octopus would be kept as the villain, as he was both a visually interesting villain who was a physical match for Spider-Man, and a sympathetic figure with humanity, accompanied {{by the fact that the}} character had been repeatedly considered as a villain for the first film over the course of its 15-year development. Raimi changed much of the character's backstory, however, adding the idea of Otto Octavius being a hero of Peter, and how their conflict was about trying to rescue him from his demons rather than kill him.|$|E
2500|$|Things {{changed for}} O'Brien in 1991, when in quick succession, an {{engagement}} fell through; Lookwell was not picked up; and, burned out, he quit Saturday Night Live. [...] "I told Lorne Michaels I couldn't {{come back to}} work and I just needed to do something else," [...] O'Brien recalled. [...] "I had no plan whatsoever. I was literally in this big transition phase in my life where I decided, I'll just walk around New York City, and an idea will come to me." [...] Mike Reiss and Al Jean, then dual showrunners of The Simpsons, called O'Brien and offered him a job. The series was notorious in the writing community at the time; O'Brien recalls [...] "everyone wanted to be on that show, but they never hired." [...] O'Brien {{was one of the first}} hires after the show's original crew. With the help of old Groundlings friend Lisa Kudrow, O'Brien purchased an apartment in Beverly Hills. He and Kudrow became involved as well, and Kudrow believed he should begin performing rather than writing. O'Brien disagreed, feeling that Kudrow was being overly flattering and that asserting he was <b>happy</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> writer. In his speech given at Class Day at Harvard in 2000, O'Brien credited The Simpsons with saving him, a reference to the career slump he was experiencing prior to his being hired for the show.|$|E
