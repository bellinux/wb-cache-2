40|$|We {{document}} {{the fact that}} at both the aggregate and the firm level, corporations tend to simultaneously raise <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> and accumulate liquid assets. For all but the very largest firms, the aggregate correlation between <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> raised and liquidity accumulation is 0. 6, and the average firm level correlation is 0. 2. This seems puzzling if internal and <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> are substitutes and <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> is costly. In fact, static pecking order intuition predicts that firms will first draw down liquid balances and only then issue <b>external</b> <b>finance.</b> On the other hand, if one believes that the cost of <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> varies over time, then the fact that there appear to be aggregate waves of issuance and savings activity may not be surprising. We show that a simple dynamic model with constant costs of <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> can easily match the observed positive correlation between liquidity accumulation and <b>external</b> <b>finance.</b> We compare the results of this simple model to those from a model which features a shock to the cost of <b>external</b> <b>finance...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{connection}} between the capital market and the real estate market. Empirically, we find that positive real house price shocks lower the <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> premium and stimulate nonresidential investment and real GDP. Our theoretical framework is able to mimic the volatility of the <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> premium, the relative price of real estate and capital, and the investment in real estate and capital. It also captures the cyclicality of the <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> premium and of real estate prices. The contribution of real estate price fluctuations to the variability of the <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> premium and the GDP is confirmed to be significant. ...|$|R
25|$|Paraguay {{also lost}} its {{financial}} independence {{as it became}} deeply indebted to foreign creditors. Moreover, those foreign creditors (mainly British) also took over critical infrastructures which had been developed integrally by the state without any kind of <b>external</b> <b>financing,</b> such as the railroad system. The imposition of those predatory practices {{under the banner of}} free trade curtailed the incipient development of Paraguay's economy.|$|E
25|$|In irrigation, SSA states {{represent}} {{almost all}} spending; in transport and energy {{a majority of}} investment is state spending; in Information and communication technologies and water supply and sanitation, the private sector represents the majority of capital expenditure. Overall, aid, {{the private sector and}} non-OECD financiers between them exceed state spending. The private sector spending alone equals state capital expenditure, though the majority is focused on ICT infrastructure investments. <b>External</b> <b>financing</b> increased from $7 billion (2002) to $27 billion (2009). China, in particular, has emerged as an important investor.|$|E
25|$|The {{share of}} <b>external</b> <b>financing</b> varies greatly. In the 2001-2005 period {{official}} development assistance financed 71% of investments in Benin, 68% in Tanzania, 63% in Kenya, 43% in the DR of Congo, 34% in South Africa, 13% in Nigeria and less than 1% in Côte d'Ivoire or Botswana. According to another World Bank study of 5 countries, in the 2002-2008 period {{official development assistance}} financed on average 62% of public expenditures on water and sanitation. The share varied from 83% in Sierra Leone to 23% in the Republic of Congo.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine whether}} {{financial}} systems facilitate efficient {{allocation of resources}} into perspective projects. Employing European micro-level data from 1996 - 2005, we show that firms in industries with the best growth opportunities use more <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> in financially more developed countries. The result is robust to controlling for technology determinants of <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> and to choosing different proxies for growth opportunities. We also find that the explanatory power of the technology determinants decreases significantly once growth opportunities are controlled for, {{which suggests that the}} often used measures of determinants of <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> are partly driven by growth opportunities.

40|$|US {{data show}} that the <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> premium, {{measured}} by the high yield bond spread, moves countercyclically and leads movements in output by four quarters. This paper constructs a model with nominal rigidities and financial accelerator to explain this observation. The key finding of this paper is: it is agents' reaction on news about future technology changes that generates the observed countercyclical movement and lead-lag pattern of the <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> premium, while a contemporary technology shock generates a procyclical movement of the <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> premium. The variance decomposition based on the estimated model demonstrates that news shocks account for about 72 % of fluctuations in the <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> premium. ...|$|R

25|$|Usually, {{water is}} {{provided}} by utilities in urban areas and municipalities or community groups in rural areas. Sewerage is not common and wastewater treatment is even less common. Sanitation is often {{in the form of}} individual pit latrines or shared toilets. 70% of investments in water supply and sanitation in Sub-Saharan Africa are financed internally and only 30% is financed externally (2001–2005 average). Most of the internal financing is household self-finance ($2.1bn), which is primarily for on-site sanitation such as latrines. Public sector financing ($1.2bn) is almost as high as <b>external</b> <b>financing</b> (US$1.4bn). The contribution of private commercial financing has been negligible at $10 million only.|$|E

S attributes the largely positive projections to diversification in income generation, the government's efforts towards fiscal consolidation, improvement in <b>external</b> <b>financing</b> conditions and performance, and stronger capital inflows and remittances. ESCAP report published in May 2015 claimed that {{economic growth in}} Pakistan picked up to 4.1% in 2014 {{from an average of}} 3.7% in the previous three years and growth was expected to rise to 5.1% in 2015.|$|E
40|$|We {{suggest the}} {{possibility}} that the poor empirical performance of the Tobin’s q model is due to a misspecification problem.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of policy initiatives co-ordinated by Asian national governments on firms' access to <b>external</b> <b>finance,</b> using a unique firm-level database of eight Asian countries- Hong Kong SAR, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand over the period of 1996 - 2012. Using a difference-indifferences approach and controlling for firm-level and macroeconomic factors, the results show a significant impact of policy on firms' access to <b>external</b> <b>finance.</b> After splitting firms into constrained and unconstrained, using several criteria, the results document that unconstrained firms benefited significantly in obtaining <b>external</b> <b>finance,</b> compared to their constrained counterparts. Finally, we show {{that the increase in}} access to <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> after the policy initiative helped firms to raise their investment spending, especially for unconstrained firms...|$|R
40|$|Our {{objective}} {{in this paper}} is to analyze empirically the relationship between the <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> premium of non-financial corporations in Brazil with their default probability and with their demand for inventories. As for the former relation, we find that corporations that have greater <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> premium have greater probability of default. As for the latter, we find that the <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> premium is positive and statistically significantly correlated. The results confirm previous results of the literature that indicate that the balance sheet channel of monetary policy is relevant in Brazil. ...|$|R
25|$|The airline {{completed}} its decentralisation from CAAC when it gained independence on 10 October 1993. As such, the airline could {{from then on}} restructure itself into shareholding enterprises, independently arrange <b>external</b> <b>financing</b> and establish subsidiaries to complement its core enterprise. During the airline's early years, the carrier was the dominant domestic carrier. Together with the two major airlines of China– Air China and China Eastern– the airline handled half of passenger traffic carried by all Chinese carriers. Owing to Air China's status as the country's flag carrier, the airline is entitled to extensive international service rights, with China Eastern and China Southern's international networks confined to mainly East Asia and within Asia, respectively. Like other Chinese carriers, China Southern was subjected to CAAC's exclusive right to grant operating rights for every prospective route {{as well as to}} regulate domestic prices.|$|E
25|$|Ethiopia {{delivers}} roughly 81% {{of water}} volume to the Nile through the river basins of the Blue Nile, Sobat River and Atbara. In 1959, Egypt and Sudan signed a bilateral treaty, the 1959 Nile Waters Agreement, which gave both countries exclusive maritime rights over the Nile waters. Ever since, Egypt {{under international law}} vetoed almost all projects in Ethiopia that sought to utilize the local Nile tributaries. This {{had the effect of}} discouraging <b>external</b> <b>financing</b> of hydropower and irrigation projects in western Ethiopia, thereby impeding water resource-based economic development projects. However, Ethiopia {{is in the process of}} constructing a large 6,450 MW hydroelectric dam on the Blue Nile river. When completed, this Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is slated to be the largest hydroelectric power station on the continent. The Gibe III hydroelectric project already generates an estimated 1,870-MW.|$|E
25|$|Whereas a {{national}} recession is identified by two quarters of decline, defining a global recession is more difficult, because a Developing country {{is expected to}} have a higher GDP growth than a Developed country. According to the IMF, the real GDP growth of the emerging and developing countries is on an uptrend and that of advanced economies is on a downtrend since late 1980s. The world growth is projected to slow from 5% in 2007 to 3.75% in 2008 and to just over 2% in 2009. Downward revisions in GDP growth vary across regions. Among the most affected are commodity exporters, and countries with acute <b>external</b> <b>financing</b> and liquidity problems. Countries in East Asia (including China) have suffered smaller declines because their financial situations are more robust. They have benefited from falling commodity prices and they have initiated a shift toward macroeconomic policy easing.|$|E

40|$|We {{study how}} non-listed firms trade off financial, real, and {{distributive}} uses of cash. We show that firms' marginal value of cash (MVC) affects {{the mix of}} <b>external</b> and internal <b>finance</b> used to absorb fluctuations in cash flows; in particular, high-MVC firms employ substantially more <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> on the margin. Linking firms to their main bank, we find that shocks to bank finance affect corporate trade-offs and have real effects in high-MVC firms, making investment more sensitive to firm cash flows. Our analysis suggests that <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> constraints affect the real economy via firms' marginal value of cash.

The MTDF recognizes that with 0.25% of its total GDP, Pakistan's investment in the {{water supply and sanitation}} sector is inadequate and provides for US$2 billion (120 billion rupee) or US$404 million per year for the sector from 2005 to 2010, half of which is to be paid by the federal and provincial governments, including the construction and rehabilitation of water supply schemes in urban and rural areas and wastewater treatment plants in provincial capitals. The other half is expected to be provided by the private sector and includes water supply systems, sewerage networks and wastewater treatment as part of new housing schemes in cities and towns.|$|E
25|$|<b>External</b> <b>financing</b> {{institutions}} {{were concerned with}} the insufficient capacity to operate and maintain the infrastructure they were financing in Lebanon. Until 2000 there were 21 water authorities in Lebanon who were financially and technically weak. The limited sewer networks, if they existed at all, were managed by the respective municipalities, which had often even less technical and financial capacity than the water authorities. In {{the absence of a}} sanitation tariff, municipalities lacked the financial resources to operate and maintain sanitation infrastructure. The experience with wastewater treatment plants is illustrative of the difficulties encountered. For example, the operating costs for the first wastewater treatment plant in Lebanon, the Al-Ghadir plant in Beirut completed in 1997, still have to be subsidized by the government because the municipal governments in the service area (the Beirut and Baabda districts) lack the resources to do so. Furthermore, incomplete infrastructure considerably reduces the development impact of the plant. Because the construction of sewers was delayed, most of the sewage of Southern Beirut still flowed into the Mediterranean without any treatment via both the Al Ghadir River and sea outlets. The Al Ghadir plant provides only preliminary treatment, followed by discharge through a 2.6km marine outfall. The second wastewater treatment plant built in Lebanon, intended for the city of Baalbek and completed in 2001, could not be put into operation, because both the sewer system and the outfall main were not completed. Wastewater treatment plants in Tripoli and Sidon were inaugurated in 2009 and 2010 respectively, both long after they were due to be completed.|$|E

40|$|Why do {{corporations}} accumulate liquid assets? We show theoretically that intertemporal trade-offs between {{interest income}} taxation {{and the cost}} of <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> determine optimal savings. Intriguingly, we find that, controlling for Tobin's "q", saving and cash flow are negatively related because firms lower cash reserves to invest after receiving positive cash-flow shocks, and vice versa. Consistent with theory, we estimate negative propensities to save out of cash flow. We also find that income uncertainty affects saving more than do <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> constraints. Therefore, contrary to previous evidence, saving propensities reflect too many forces to be used to measure <b>external</b> <b>finance</b> constraints.
