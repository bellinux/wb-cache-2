5|$|The main {{damage done}} by mole crickets is {{as a result of}} their {{burrowing}} activities. As they tunnel through the top few centimetres of soil they push the ground up in little ridges, increasing evaporation of surface moisture, disturbing germinating seeds and damaging the delicate young roots of seedlings. They are also <b>injurious</b> to turf- and pasture-grasses as they feed on the roots of the grasses, leaving the plants prone to drying-out and damage by use.|$|E
5|$|Relatively {{inactive}} during daytime, the sparsely-spotted stingaree preys {{mainly on}} crustaceans, {{and to a}} much lesser extent on polychaete worms and other small benthic organisms. It is aplacental viviparous, with the mother provisioning her young with histotroph ("uterine milk"). Life history differs between the eastern and western subpopulations: eastern females bear litters of up to six pups with a twelve-month gestation period, while western females bear litters of {{only one or two}} pups with a ten-month gestation period. Also, western rays mature later and live longer than eastern rays. The venomous sting of the sparsely-spotted stingaree is potentially <b>injurious</b> to humans, and it has been reported to react aggressively if disturbed. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern, as there is little fishing activity over the majority of its range.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} aplacental viviparous, with the {{developing}} embryos sustained to term by histotroph ("uterine milk") {{produced by the}} mother. Females bear litters of up to four pups every other year, after a gestation period of at least six months. This species is closely related to, and may hybridize with, the yellowback stingaree (U.sufflavus). The venomous sting of the crossback stingaree is potentially <b>injurious</b> to humans. This common species is seldom caught by commercial fisheries other than in the northernmost extent of its range. Thus, its population is largely secure and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The Whig Party {{was also}} divided in Kentucky, not only between Clay and Taylor, but between gubernatorial candidates. William J. Graves, out of {{politics}} since his fatal shooting of Representative Cilley, had the backing of sitting Whig governor William Owsley, while Archibald Dixon had secured support from former Whig governor Robert P. Letcher. Letcher wrote to Crittenden that a Whig split and Democratic victory in the gubernatorial election would have an <b>injurious</b> effect on Whig hopes of carrying Kentucky in the 1848 presidential election; another former Whig governor, Thomas Metcalfe, concurred. At the Whig nominating convention, both Graves and Dixon withdrew their names and a delegate from Logan County put forward Crittenden's name without his consent. The nomination easily carried before Crittenden's friends could block it. The governorship was less prestigious and paid less than Crittenden's position in the Senate. He {{would also have to}} abandon his growing legal practice before the Supreme Court and would lose input on national issues of importance to him such as the territorial questions that grew out of the Mexican War. Nevertheless, he believed that his candidacy would unite the Whigs and help Taylor win Kentucky's electoral votes in the general election. He accepted the nomination a week after it was made.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{common ragwort}} (Senecio jacobaea) {{is one of}} the five plants named as an <b>injurious</b> weed under the {{provisions}} of the Weeds Act 1959. The word <b>injurious</b> in this context indicates that it could be harmful to agriculture not that it is dangerous to animals, as all the other <b>injurious</b> weeds listed are non-toxic. Under the terms of this Act, a land occupier can be required by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs {{to prevent the spread of}} the plant. However, the growth of the plant is not made illegal by the Act and there is no statutory obligation for control placed upon landowners in general.|$|E

Rall's suit stated that Hellman was attempting to sabotage his career. Four of Rall's five claims were dismissed, leaving libel per se. The lawsuit remains unresolved.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of Irish Catholics is a cruel one. We are enslaved by a Protestant power. The penal laws against our religion {{are not yet}} abolished in full.

He does not make himself responsible, however, for all that the paper contains.|$|E
25|$|Definite loss: The loss {{takes place}} at a known time, in a known place, and from a known cause. The classic example is death of an insured person on a life {{insurance}} policy. Fire, automobile accidents, and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion. Other types of losses may only be definite in theory. Occupational disease, for instance, may involve prolonged exposure to <b>injurious</b> conditions where no specific time, place, or cause is identifiable. Ideally, the time, place, and cause of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person, with sufficient information, could objectively verify all three elements.|$|E
25|$|Against {{all these}} ascetic views and tendencies Maimonides raised his {{powerful}} voice, and his sober view maintained the upper hand. He admits the wholesome influence on those needing much {{discipline of the}} soul of fasting and vigils, of sexual and social abstemiousness, the self-torture of the hermit, and of the penitent who dwells in deserts and uses only coarse haircloth for the covering of his flesh; but he declares the constant use of what can at best be only a remedial measure in abnormal and unsound conditions of life {{to be a great}} folly and <b>injurious</b> extravagance.|$|E
25|$|To be {{prepared}} against any future attempt {{of the same}} kind, Otto judged it prudent {{at this time to}} enter into a treaty with his maternal uncle King Valdemar II of Denmark, by which they respectively bound themselves to support each other against all enemies whatsoever. This treaty was in the end most <b>injurious</b> to the states of Brunswick. Otto was made count of Garding and Thetesbüll by King Valdemar, and participated in the Battle of Mölln of 1225 and the Battle of Bornhöved of 1227 on the side of Denmark. After the last battle Otto was imprisoned in Rostock, the capital of Schwerin, where he was shut up in a fortress.|$|E
25|$|A {{major issue}} in {{whiplash}} prevention {{is the lack of}} proper adjustment of the seat safety system by both drivers and passengers. Studies have shown that a well designed and adjusted head restraint could prevent potentially <b>injurious</b> head-neck kinematics in rear-end collisions by limiting the differential movement of the head and torso. The primary function of a head restraint is to minimize the relative rearward movement {{of the head and neck}} during rear impact. During a rear-end collision, the presence of an effective head restraint behind the occupant’s head can limit the differential movement of the head and torso. A properly placed head restraint where one can sufficiently protect his/her head lower the chances of head injury by up to 35% during a rear-end collision.|$|E
25|$|The {{pattern of}} injury, {{evaluation}} and treatment will {{vary with the}} mechanism of the injury. Blunt trauma causes injury via a shock effect; delivering energy over an area. Wounds are often not straight and unbroken skin may hide significant injury. Penetrating trauma follows {{the course of the}} <b>injurious</b> device. As the energy is applied in a more focused fashion, it requires less energy to cause significant injury. Any body organ, including bone and brain, can be injured and bleed. Bleeding may not be readily apparent; internal organs such as the liver, kidney and spleen may bleed into the abdominal cavity. The only apparent signs may come with blood loss. Bleeding from a bodily orifice, such as the rectum, nose, or ears may signal internal bleeding, but cannot be relied upon. Bleeding from a medical procedure also falls into this category.|$|E
25|$|On September 11, 2009, she {{advanced}} the decriminalization of <b>injurious</b> calumny against public officials, a charge which had, in 2000, {{resulted in a}} prison term of one year for Eduardo Kimel, a journalist investigating the San Patricio Church massacre of 1976. She drew fire for a highly controversial Audiovisual Media Law proposed shortly afterwards, however. Defended by the government as a reform intended to fragment ownership of media companies so as to encourage plurality of opinion, the bill was criticised by part of the opposition {{as a means to}} silence voices critical of the government, especially those in the Clarín media group (the country's largest). However, a significant amount of opposing congressmen voted in favor of the law, as they considered it was clearly an improvement on the existing one; also, the government had been willing to negotiate and modify parts of the proposed new law to improve it.|$|E
25|$|Pasley's diving salvage {{operation}} set many diving milestones, {{including the}} first recorded use of the buddy system in diving, when he gave instructions to his divers to operate in pairs. In addition, the first emergency swimming ascent was made by a diver after his air line became tangled {{and he had to}} cut it free. A less fortunate milestone was the first medical account of a diving barotrauma. The early diving helmets had no non-return valves, so if a hose was severed near the surface, the ambient pressure air around the diver's head rapidly drained from the helmet to the lower pressure at the break, leaving a pressure difference between the inside and outside of the helmet that could cause <b>injurious</b> and sometimes life-threatening effects. At the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in 1842, Sir John Richardson described the diving apparatus and treatment of diver Roderick Cameron following an injury that occurred on 14 October 1841 during the salvage operations.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Dulaney Jr. of Maryland, {{likewise}} {{observed that}} attempting to tax subjects on the inequitable basis of 'virtual' representation was unsound because, The {{situation of the}} non-electors in England — their capacity to become electors — their inseparable connection {{with those who are}} electors, and their representatives — their security against oppression resulting from this connection, and the necessity of imagining a double or virtual representation, to avoid iniquity and absurdity, have been explained — the inhabitants of the colonies are, as such, incapable of being electors, the privilege of election being exerciseable only in person, and therefore if every inhabitant of America had the requisite freehold, not one could vote, but upon the supposition of his ceasing to be an inhabitant of America, and becoming a resident of Great-Britain, a supposition which would be impertinent, because it shifts the question — should the colonies not be taxed by parliamentary impositions, their respective legislatures have a regular, adequate, and constitutional authority to tax them, and, therefore, there would not necessarily be an iniquitous and absurd exemption, from their not being represented by the House of Commons. There is not that intimate and inseparable relation between the electors of Great-Britain, and the inhabitants of the colonies, which must inevitably involve both in the same taxation; on the contrary, not a single actual elector in England might be immediately affected by a taxation in America, imposed by a statute which would have a general operation and effect, upon the properties of the inhabitants of the colonies. The latter might be oppressed in a thousand shapes, without any sympathy, or exciting any alarm in the former. Moreover, even acts, oppressive and <b>injurious</b> to the colonies in an extreme degree, might become popular in England, from the promise or expectation, that the very measures which depressed the colonies, would give ease to the inhabitants of Great-Britain.|$|E
