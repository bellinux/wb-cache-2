5|$|The only {{floppy disk}} drives that were readily {{available}} in 1975 were IBM compatible 8-inch drives. MITS selected the Pertec FD400 disk drive which could store over 300,000 bytes of data. The Altair <b>disk</b> <b>controller</b> occupied two boards and had over 60 ICs. The initial units were to be available in August, but were delayed {{until the end of}} 1975. The production version of Extended Disk BASIC was released in April 1976. The controller with one disk drive sold for $1,480 (kit) and $1,980 (assembled).|$|E
25|$|When using {{hardware}} RAID, {{the controller}} usually adds controller-dependent {{data to the}} drives which prevents software RAID from accessing the user data. While {{it is possible to}} read the data with a compatible hardware RAID controller, this inconveniences consumers as a compatible controller usually isn't readily available. Using the JBOD/RAID-Z combination, any <b>disk</b> <b>controller</b> can be used to resume operation after a controller failure.|$|E

50|$|The Multibus based Xylogics 450 SMD and Xylogics 451 ESMD <b>disk</b> <b>controllers</b> {{along with}} Interphase Multibus SMD <b>disk</b> <b>controllers</b> were {{significant}} to the workstation and minicomputer industry during the 1980s as a low cost interface the low cost, high performance, high capacity SMD and ESMD disk drives {{available at the}} time. Sun 1, Sun 2 and Sun 3 servers and Silicon Graphics IRIS, HP/Apollo all used Xylogics 450 and 451 <b>disk</b> <b>controllers.</b>|$|R

25|$|A blank {{unformatted}} diskette has a {{coating of}} magnetic oxide with no magnetic {{order to the}} particles. During formatting, the magnetizations of the particles are aligned forming tracks, each broken up into sectors, enabling the controller to properly read and write data. The tracks are concentric rings around the center, with spaces between tracks where no data is written; gaps with padding bytes are provided between the sectors {{and at the end}} of the track to allow for slight speed variations in the disk drive, and to permit better interoperability with disk drives connected to other similar systems. Each sector of data has a header that identifies the sector location on the disk. A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is written into the sector headers {{and at the end of}} the user data so that the <b>disk</b> <b>controller</b> can detect potential errors. Some errors are soft and can be resolved by automatically re-trying the read operation; other errors are permanent and the <b>disk</b> <b>controller</b> will signal a failure to the operating system if multiple attempts to read the data still fail.|$|E
25|$|Gary Kildall {{originally}} developed CP/M during 1974, as an operating system {{to run on}} an Intel Intellec-8 development system, equipped with a Shugart Associates 8-inch floppy disk drive interfaced via a custom floppy <b>disk</b> <b>controller.</b> It was written in Kildall's own PL/M (Programming Language for Microcomputers). Various aspects of CP/M were influenced by the TOPS-10 operating system of the DECsystem-10 mainframe computer, which Kildall had used as a development environment.|$|E
25|$|The new B+ was {{incapable}} of operating some original BBC B programs and games, such as, for example, the very popular Castle Quest. A particular problem was {{the replacement of the}} Intel 8271 floppy <b>disk</b> <b>controller</b> with the Western Digital 1770 – not only was the new controller mapped to different addresses, it was fundamentally incompatible and the 8271 emulators that existed were necessarily imperfect for all but basic operation. Software that used copy protection techniques involving direct access to the controller, simply would not operate on the new system. Acorn attempted to alleviate this, starting with version 2.20 of the 1770 DFS, via an 8271-backward- compatible Ctrl+Z+Break option.|$|E

High-end disks use SCSI, Fibre Channel or Serial Attached SCSI. <b>Disk</b> <b>controllers</b> can also control {{the timing of}} access to flash memory which is not mechanical in nature (i.e. no physical disk).|$|R

25|$|The HDD's {{electronics}} {{control the}} movement of the actuator and the rotation of the disk, and perform reads and writes on demand from the <b>disk</b> <b>controller.</b> Feedback of the drive electronics is accomplished by means of special segments of the disk dedicated to servo feedback. These are either complete concentric circles (in the case of dedicated servo technology), or segments interspersed with real data (in the case of embedded servo technology). The servo feedback optimizes the signal to noise ratio of the GMR sensors by adjusting the voice-coil of the actuated arm. The spinning of the disk also uses a servo motor. Modern disk firmware is capable of scheduling reads and writes efficiently on the platter surfaces and remapping sectors of the media which have failed.|$|E
25|$|A {{spindle motor}} {{in the drive}} rotates the {{magnetic}} medium at a certain speed, while a stepper motor-operated mechanism moves the magnetic read/write head(s) radially along {{the surface of the}} disk. Both read and write operations require the media to be rotating and the head to contact the disk media, an action originally accomplished by a disk-load solenoid. Later drives held the heads out of contact until a front-panel lever was rotated (5¼") or disk insertion was complete (3½"). To write data, current is sent through a coil in the head as the media rotates. The head's magnetic field aligns the magnetization of the particles directly below the head on the media. When the current is reversed the magnetization aligns in the opposite direction, encoding one bit of data. To read data, the magnetization of the particles in the media induce a tiny voltage in the head coil as they pass under it. This small signal is amplified and sent to the floppy <b>disk</b> <b>controller,</b> which converts the streams of pulses from the media into data, checks it for errors, and sends it to the host computer system.|$|E
25|$|Hard disk {{controllers}} (IBM 2844, 3830, among others, and compatibles) {{accept the}} X'02' command, but first cause a seek to cylinder X'0000', and head X'0000', and {{a search for}} record X'01', before executing the sequential read command {{as if it was}} a X'06'. Without this special hard <b>disk</b> <b>controller</b> behavior, device independent IPL would not be possible. On a hard drive, the IPL Text is contained on cylinder X'0000', track X'0000', and block X'01' (24 bytes), and cylinder X'0000', track X'0000', and block X'02' (fairly large, certainly somewhat more than 3,000 bytes). The volume label is always contained on cylinder X'0000', track X'0000', and block X'03' (80 bytes). The volume label always points to the VTOC, with a pointer of the form HHHH (that is, the VTOC must reside within the first 65,536 tracks). The VTOC's Format 4 DSCB defines the extent (size) of the VTOC, so the volume label only needs a pointer to the first track in the VTOC's extent, and as the Format 4 DSCB, which describes the VTOC, is always the very first DSCB in the VTOC, HHHH also points to the Format 4 DSCB.|$|E

500|$|The ZX Spectrum +2A was {{a variant}} of the Spectrum +3, also {{released}} in 1987, and housed inside a black case. The Spectrum +2A/+3 motherboard (AMSTRAD part number Z70830) was designed such that it could be assembled without the floppy <b>disk</b> <b>controller</b> or associated logic and a +2 style [...] "datacorder" [...] connected. Originally, Amstrad planned to introduce an additional disk interface for the +2A/+2B called the AMSTRAD SI-1, but it never appeared.

2500|$|Another LED/photo-transistor pair {{located near}} the center of the disk detects the index hole once per {{rotation}} in the magnetic disk; it is used to detect the angular start of each track [...] and whether or not the disk is rotating at the correct speed. Early 8‑inch and 5¼‑inch disks had physical holes for each sector and were termed hard sectored disks. Later soft-sectored disks have only one index hole, and sector position is determined by the <b>disk</b> <b>controller</b> or low-level software from patterns marking the start of a sector. Generally, the same drives are used to read and write both types of disks, with only the disks and controllers differing. Some operating systems utilizing soft sectors, such as Apple DOS, do not use the index hole; the drives designed for such systems often lack the corresponding sensor; this was mainly a hardware cost-saving measure.|$|E
