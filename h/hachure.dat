40|$|<b>Hachures</b> in Digital Cartography Abstract This thesis {{deals with}} the {{possibilities}} of creating <b>hachures,</b> especially slope and shadow, in digital cartography. First part focuses on utilization of <b>hachures</b> and its construction in classic cartography. The rules that should {{be observed by the}} mapmaker are described. In the next section are delineated the current possibilities how to create <b>hachures</b> in digital cartography. The existing algorithms are evaluated. On the basis of the rules and research of literature is designed own methodology. Emphasis is put on automation using digital terrain model. The work as well contains testing the algorithm on the real data. Key words: <b>hachures,</b> digital cartography, hypsograph...|$|R

5000|$|... "Throughout {{the first}} 16 {{years of my}} career, nature was the primary theme of my artwork. My {{tapestries}} were prepared with the techniques of classical French gobelins, with dense spacing of the wrap, applying <b>hachure,</b> and delicate transitions of subtle colors.“Castle-Resonance”, an exhibition in Gödöllő, inspired me to turn my work to a different artistic direction. The compelling themes of Castle Resonance encouraged me to experiment with unconventional materials providing {{a new dimension to}} my artwork. During this period, I completed “Find 2000”, a work that inspired a chain of ideas that continued to dominate my future designs.Since then, I remain captivated by the idea of contrasts, particularly, the contrasts between various textures, rustic and fine surfaces, and various materials; the fine and detailed goblin in opposition to sackcloth together on tapestry; silk versus linen; weaving hemp-yarn against gold threads or wool and silk threads simultaneously to create a drastic, yet astonishing effect within each individual piece.While working on this new stylistic effect, I also became interested in thematic elements associated with Eastern cultures and religions, and these novel themes became apparent in my work.Presently, I am mainly focusing on the design of praying-rugs which I named the “Sacred Tapestries”. So far, six individual pieces have been completed. They were woven with an interesting and difficult technical approach using wool, linen or silk on every second weft. In my artwork I combine the Eastern and Western culture by incorporating the motives from the oriental rugs.With my “Sacred Tapestries” I would like to send a message that transcends cultural, racial and religious barriers." ...|$|E

40|$|The Royal Commission on Ancient and Historic Monuments for Scotland (RCAHMS) {{are obliged}} to record Historical Monuments and to make this {{information}} available to the public. The traditional method of relief representation within archaeology employs ‘hachures ’ (a <b>hachure</b> being a hand drawn line {{along the line of}} steepest gradient of a slope and in the direction of that slope). With the development of GIS within RCAHMS this data has to be digitally accessible. This research reports on a method for automatic relief representation (archaeological features such as ramparts and mound) required in order to visualise archaeological monuments within a GIS. The need for automated relief representation arose because current methods for the representation of monument sites as points or lines is not adequate and an automated process was necessary in terms of time and economic efficiency. Furthermore alternatives to hatchuring (such as contours, relief shading and DTMs) proved ineffective at showing the subtle morphological changes that typically define earth works and boundaries to ancient monuments. In this paper we report on an automated <b>hachure</b> process, developed in C, and embedded in the GenaMap GIS. The C program takes as input the isolines defining {{the top and bottom of}} the slope and ‘drops ’ hachures between these contours. Results of implementation are presented and evaluated against hand drawn results...|$|E

40|$|Incised stones {{have been}} {{reported}} from locations across Idaho, most commonly in the panhandle region. Though relatively rare, they are in some instances associated with Late Archaic (2000 [...] 150 B. P.) period sites and in southeastern Idaho with the Fremont pattern (1300 [...] 500 B. P.). Four types of incised stones are described. Type 1 items consist of stones characterized by parallel lines located on the face or margins of the stone with lines that may be horizontal, vertical or diagonal, or a combination, though one direction is usually predominant; in some cases, the lines are minimal in length and/or number. Type 2 incised stones are characterized by centrally placed <b>hachure,</b> while Type 3 stones are characterized by etching or by lines that are irregular and multi-directional in placement and without discernible patterning. Type 4 stones are more decorative; these display combinations of motifs, including zig-zags, ladders, parallel lines, and chevrons.
