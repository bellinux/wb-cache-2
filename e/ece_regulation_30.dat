5000|$|All tires {{sold for}} road use in Europe after July 1997 must carry an E-mark. The mark itself is either an upper case [...] "E" [...] or lower case [...] "e" [...] - {{followed}} by a number in a circle or rectangle, {{followed by a}} further number. An (upper case) [...] "E" [...] indicates that the tire is certified {{to comply with the}} dimensional, performance and marking requirements of <b>ECE</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>30.</b> A (lower case) [...] "e" [...] indicates that the tire is certified to comply with the dimensional, performance and marking requirements of Directive 92/23/EEC. The number in the circle or rectangle denotes the country code of the government that granted the type approval. The last number outside the circle or rectangle is the number of the type approval certificate issued for that particular tire size and type.|$|E
50|$|Although {{a system}} of uniform auto safety {{performance}} and equipment <b>regulations</b> (<b>ECE</b> <b>Regulations)</b> had been in place in Europe since 1958, the United States did not seek to adopt or harmonize with these <b>ECE</b> <b>regulations,</b> which have since been adopted by virtually all industrialized countries outside North America. Compared to the <b>ECE</b> <b>regulations,</b> American regulations are fundamentally different in philosophy, content, emphasis, and enforcement protocol. Vehicles conforming to the internationalized (originally European) <b>ECE</b> <b>regulations</b> are allowed or required throughout the entire rest of the world, but such vehicles are illegal in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|<b>ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> 90 (abbreviated [...] "ECE R90") is an <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> specifying design, construction, and {{performance}} requirements and test protocols for replacement brake linings for roadgoing motor vehicles and trailers.|$|R

50|$|In 1958, {{under the}} auspices of the United Nations, a {{consortium}} called the Economic Commission for Europe had been established to commonize vehicle regulations across Europe so as to standardize best practices in vehicle design and equipment and minimize technical barriers to pan-European vehicle trade and traffic. This eventually became the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations, which began to promulgate what would eventually become the UN's <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulations</b> on vehicle design, construction, and safety performance. Although most of the world's countries accept or require ECE-compliant vehicles—either as official signatories to <b>ECE</b> <b>regulations</b> or by national regulations effectively identical to ECE—the United States, virtually alone in the world, has declined to join the forum or accept <b>ECE</b> <b>regulations,</b> and blocks the importation of vehicles built to international <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulations</b> rather than the U.S. safety regulations.|$|R
50|$|Both the internationalized European <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> 19 and North American SAE {{standard}} J583 permit {{selective yellow}} front fog lamps. <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> 48 currently requires new vehicles to {{be equipped with}} headlamps emitting white light. However, selective yellow headlamps remain permitted throughout Europe on vehicles already so equipped, {{as well as in}} non-European locales such as Japan and New Zealand.|$|R
25|$|International <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulations</b> permit higher-intensity high-beam {{headlamps}} {{than are}} allowed under North American regulations.|$|R
5000|$|UK {{regulations}} briefly required vehicles {{first used}} on or after 1 April 1987 to {{be equipped with}} a dim-dip deviceor functionally dedicated daytime running lamps, except those vehicles type-approved to <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> 48 regarding installation of lighting equipment—this exception was made because ECE R48 did not require dim-dip or daytime running lights, and while countries signatory to the <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulations</b> are permitted to maintain their own national regulations as an option to the <b>ECE</b> <b>regulations,</b> they {{are not permitted to}} bar vehicles approved under the <b>ECE</b> <b>regulations.</b> The dim-dip system operated the low beam headlamps (called [...] "dipped beam" [...] in the UK) at between 10% and 20% of normal low beam intensity. The running lamps permitted as an alternative to dim-dip were required to emit at least 200 cd straight ahead, and no more than 800 cd in any direction. In practice, most vehicles were equipped with the dim-dip option rather than the running lamps.|$|R

50|$|Amendments {{to include}} ISOFIX in UN <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulations</b> 14 & 44, which specify uniform {{provisions}} {{for the design}} of vehicle seat anchorages and child safety seats, came into force in February 2004.|$|R
50|$|European Union Directive 2008/89/EC {{requires}} all {{passenger cars}} and small delivery vans first type approved on or after 7 February 2011 in the EU to come equipped with daytime running lights. The mandate {{was extended to}} trucks and buses in August 2012. Functional piggybacking, such as operating the headlamps or front turn signals or fog lamps as DRLs, is not permitted; the EU Directive requires functionally specific daytime running lamps compliant with <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> 87 and mounted to the vehicle in accord with <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> 48. DRLs compliant with R87 emit white light of between 400 and 1,200 candela.|$|R
50|$|Together {{with the}} (now defunct) American Automobile Manufacturers Association, {{in the late}} 1990s Global Automakers {{advocated}} for U.S. regulators to begin recognizing some of the <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulations,</b> which are used instead of U.S. regulations {{throughout most of the}} world.|$|R
50|$|Under <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> 37, which governs {{automotive}} {{filament lamps}} {{in most of}} the world, the H1 lamp's nominal rating is 55 watts at 12 volts, and its test rating is 68W (maximum) and 1550 ±15% lumens at 13.2V. R37 also contains provisions for 6-volt, 55-watt and 24-volt, 70-watt H1 lamps. The United States government does not recognise <b>ECE</b> <b>regulations,</b> but rather applies its own regulations. Under these, the H1 is rated 65W (maximum) and 1410 lumens ±15% at 12.8V. Despite the two different sets of specified voltages and test protocols, the lamps themselves are the same; with few exceptions, 12-volt H1 lamps are generally manufactured and tested to comply with both regulations.|$|R
25|$|In Europe and {{the many}} non-European {{countries}} applying <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulations,</b> even HID headlamps designed as such must be equipped with lens cleaning and automatic self-leveling systems, except on motorcycles. These systems are usually absent on vehicles not originally equipped with HID lamps.|$|R
50|$|Selective yellow is a colour for {{automotive}} lamps, particularly headlamps {{and other}} road-illumination lamps such as fog lamps. Under <b>ECE</b> <b>regulations,</b> headlamps were formerly permitted {{to be either}} white or selective yellow—in France, selective yellow was mandatory for all vehicles' road-illumination lamps until 1993.|$|R
50|$|Importing {{rules for}} the UK are stringent; all {{vehicles}} must undergo Individual Vehicle Approval to assure compliance with applicable <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulations</b> or British national equivalents. The speedometer must be converted from kilometres per hour to miles per hour, a rear fog light and unleaded-fuel restrictor installed.|$|R
50|$|Automotive EC Directives and <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulations</b> require {{third party}} {{approval}} - testing, certification and production conformity assessment {{by an independent}} body. Each member state is required to appoint an Approval Authority to issue the approvals, and a Technical Service {{to carry out the}} testing to the Directives and Regulations.|$|R
5000|$|Amber is one {{of several}} {{technically}} defined colors used in automotive signal lamps. In North America, SAE standard J578 governs the colorimetry of vehicle lights, while outside North America the internationalized European <b>ECE</b> <b>regulations</b> hold force. Both standards designate a range of orange-yellow hues in the CIE color space as [...] "amber".|$|R
5000|$|In early 2009, Canada's {{regulation}} {{shifted to}} harmonize with US Federal standards and international <b>ECE</b> <b>regulations.</b> As in the U.S., consumer protection groups were {{upset with the}} change, while Canadian regulators maintained that the 4 km/h test speed is used worldwide and is more compatible with improved pedestrian protection in vehicle-pedestrian crashes.|$|R
40|$|In 1993 the European Experimental Vehicles Committee (EEVC) {{has set up}} Working Group 14 {{to develop}} a test {{procedure}} for energy-absorbing front underrun protection systems (FUPS) for trucks. For this purpose the working group proposed a research programme, describing a stepwise approach to achieve this objective. This paper reports on the first results of the project dealing with accident investigation and results from car-to-truck frontal crash tests with a front underrun protection device (FUPD) according to <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> No. 93. For the first time accident data of several European countries have been connected to give an overview about the accident scene in Europe with respect to car-to-truck frontal collisions. A representative accident type {{is defined as a}} basis for crash testing. Car-to-truck frontal crash tests with a FUPD according to the <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> are described and the results are discussed...|$|R
25|$|The {{international}} <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulations</b> for filament headlamps and for high-intensity discharge headlamps {{specify a}} beam with a sharp, asymmetric cutoff preventing {{significant amounts of}} light from being cast {{into the eyes of}} drivers of preceding or oncoming cars. Control of glare is less strict in the North American SAE beam standard contained in FMVSS / CMVSS 108.|$|R
2500|$|Headlamps are {{generally}} {{required to produce}} white light, according to both ECE and SAE standards. <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> 48 currently requires new vehicles to be equipped with headlamps emitting white light. Different headlamp technologies produce different characteristic types of white light; the white specification is quite large and permits {{a wide range of}} apparent color from warm white (with a brown-orange-amber-yellow cast) to cold white (with a blue-violet cast). Previous <b>ECE</b> <b>regulations</b> also permitted selective yellow light, which from 1936 until 1993 was required on all vehicles registered in France. Selective yellow headlamps are no longer common, but are permitted in various countries throughout Europe as well as in non-European locales such as South Korea, [...] Japan and New Zealand. In Iceland, yellow headlamps are allowed and the vehicle regulations in Monaco still officially require selective yellow light from all vehicles' low beam and high beam headlamps, and fog lamps if present.|$|R
50|$|From October 2008, all {{new cars}} {{had to be}} sold with a sticker on the {{windscreen}} showing the fuel consumption and the CO2 emissions. Fuel consumption figures are expressed as urban, extra urban and combined, measured according to <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulations</b> 83 and 101 - which are the based on the European driving cycle; previously, only the combined number was given.|$|R
50|$|Automotive tell-tales are {{regulated}} by automobile safety standards worldwide. In the United States, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 101 includes tell-tales in its specifications for vehicle controls and displays. In Canada, the analogous Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 101 applies. In Europe and {{throughout most of}} the rest of the world, <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulations</b> specify various types of tell-tales.|$|R
50|$|The European {{integrated}} Hydrogen Project (EIHP) was a European Union {{project to}} integrate United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE or ECE) guidelines {{and create a}} basis of <b>ECE</b> <b>regulation</b> of hydrogen vehicles and the necessary infrastructure replacing national legislation and regulations. The aim of this project was enhancing of the safety of hydrogen vehicles and harmonizing their licensing and approval process.|$|R
50|$|Under <b>ECE</b> <b>regulations,</b> H1 lamps are {{required}} to emit white or selective yellow light. U.S. regulations require H1 lamps to emit white light. Under both ECE and U.S. specifications, the allowable range of white light is quite large; some H1 lamps have a slight blue or yellow tint to the glass yet still produce light legally acceptable under the requirement for white light.|$|R
50|$|There are no ADRs {{applicable}} to AA or AB category vehicles. There are ADRs for lighting, braking, noise, controls and dimensions for LA category vehicles, mostly referencing the equivalent UN <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulations.</b> An approval {{is required to}} supply to the market any road vehicle to which ADRs apply and an import approval is required to import any road vehicle into Australia.|$|R
50|$|On November 2011, {{the export}} version (excluding Japanese version) of the Camaro was {{introduced}} {{after a two-year}} delay. The delay {{was due to the}} unexpected domestic demand. The export version included different tail lamps with integrated reverse and amber turn signal lamps, larger external rear view mirrors with integrated side turn signal repeaters, a rear bumper without reverse light inserts, and other changes as to comply with <b>ECE</b> <b>regulations.</b>|$|R
50|$|Council Directive 80/1269/EEC of 16 December 1980 on the {{approximation}} {{of the laws}} of the Member States relating to the engine power of motor vehicles is a European Union law concerning measurement of engine power in motor vehicles intended for road use with at least four wheels and a maximum speed exceeding 25 km/h. Council Directive 80/1269/EEC is based upon ISO 1585 with some influence of <b>ECE</b> <b>regulation</b> 85. It can essentially be seen as an updated version of DIN 70020, which it has replaced.|$|R
50|$|U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 111 {{requires}} that convex side view mirrors {{must have a}} curvature radius of between 889 mm and 1651 mm. Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 111 stipulates a range of between 890 mm and 1800 mm. Neither the U.S. nor the Canadian standard allows for aspheric mirrors. The European <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> 46 used {{throughout most of the}} world permits planar, convex, and/or aspheric mirrors {{on either side of the}} vehicle. American research suggests non-planar driver side mirrors may help reduce crashes.|$|R
40|$|A {{four years}} {{accident}} statistic is shown and analysed, {{including more than}} hundred bus rollover accidents. The number of fatalities and serious injured passengers proved that although this type of accident is rear, {{it is the most}} serious bus accident. Data can be found in this statistics about the small buses and double decker (high buses and coaches) too which are not covered yet by <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> 66. The different kind of rollover accidents (turn on side, roll dawn from the road into a ditch, falling into a precipice, combined rollover accident, etc.) may be studied. The standard accident – which is the basis of the approval test in an international regulation – is analysed {{on the basis of the}} accident statistics. The paper shows the development of the standard rollover test used in the <b>ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> 66 (required strength of bus superstructure in rollover) and points out the problem of the “limited deformation”. The limited deformation is an existing problem of the Regulation 66 created by the used standard rollover test. This paper and its discussion could contribute to the international work done for the development of Reg. 66. The author is the chairman of the international expert group doing this job...|$|R
