40|$|In-channel fine-sediment storage, {{especially}} in areas draining highly <b>erodible</b> <b>materials,</b> constitutes {{an important part}} of the sediment budget of a drainage basin. This phenomenon occurs when sediment production in the basin is greater than the river's transport capacity, resulting in large accumulations of fines along the river channel. In-channel sediment storage has been studied in a similar to 3 -km channel length reach of the River Isabena during an average hydrological year (2007 - 2008). The River Isabena drains an area of 445 km(2). It is located at the Southern Pyrenees and the channel network flows through an area of extremely <b>erodible</b> <b>materials</b> producing an enormous amount of suspended sediment. Total in-channel sediment storage for the study period has been estimated at approximately 679 t, which equates to 0. 32 % of the annual suspended sediment load calculated at the basin's outlet. Sediment storage values obtained in the study reach have been extrapolated to the whole main channel length (45 km), resulting in a total storage of 9, 810 t, representing the 4. 7 % of the annual total load. In-channel storage shows both temporal and spatial trends. In relation to the former, sediment is continuously accumulated during low-flows while the latter shows that sediment accumulation increases in the downstream direction. Results suggest that the fine-grained sediment stored in the channel may represent an important component of the suspended sediment budget of rivers draining highly <b>erodible</b> <b>materials</b> such as the River Isabena.

50|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, some {{researchers}} have suspected that Alba Mons eruptions included {{a significant amount of}} pyroclastics (and therefore explosive activity) during early phases of its development. The evidence was based on the presence of numerous valley networks on the volcano's northern flanks that appeared to be carved by running water (see below). This evidence combined with thermal inertia data, which indicated a surface dominated by fine-grained materials, suggested an easily <b>erodible</b> <b>material,</b> such as volcanic ash, was present. The volcano's extremely low profile is also more easily explained if the edifice were built largely from pyroclastic flow deposits (ignimbrites).|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the large shield volcanoes, Tharsis contains a number of smaller volcanoes called tholi and paterae. The tholi are dome-shaped edifices with flanks that are much steeper than the larger Tharsis shields. Their central calderas are also quite large in proportion to their base diameters. The density of impact craters {{on many of the}} tholi indicate they are older than the large shields, having formed between late Noachian and early Hesperian times. Ceraunius Tholus and Uranius Tholus have densely channeled flanks, suggesting that the flank surfaces are made up of easily <b>erodible</b> <b>material,</b> such as ash. The age and morphology of the tholi provide strong evidence that the tholi represent the summits of old shield volcanoes that have been largely buried by great thicknesses of younger lava flows. By one estimate the Tharsis tholi may be buried by up to 4 km of lava.|$|E

40|$|Many {{soils and}} sediments in the Pilbara region of {{north-western}} Australia are highly susceptible to erosion. Large quantities of construction materials are required as iron ore mining and the extensive railway lines used to transport ore to port {{continue to be}} developed in the region. Simply avoiding the use of highly <b>erodible</b> <b>materials</b> is often considered to be too high a cost where alternatives are scarce. Constructing embankments to survive the cyclonic wet season from material highly susceptible to erosion, is a major challenge. Highly <b>erodible</b> <b>materials</b> encountered in the Pilbara include some bedrock shales, dispersive alluvial silts and sands and slaking clays and mudstones. Dispersive materials can erode internally by the formation of pipes or tunnels.

Similarly, slaking material can undergo compaction during wetting and drying cycles resulting in unexpectedly large settlements. The effect of erosion, in general, is controlled by appropriate embankment design and construction, in particular compaction standards. Erosion controls include sacrificial batters, surface protection, encapsulation and stabilisation. For many mining projects achieving short-term construction deadlines is a high priority and adding erosion control measures after construction may be preferred.

40|$|Pucioasa Lake, {{situated}} {{upstream from}} the locality bearing the same name, {{was put into}} operation in 1975. The initial volume was 10. 764 million m 3, yet the main problem is the intensive storage of alluvial deposits, {{due to the fact}} that it retains most of the solid flow brought by Ialomiţa River and by its tributaries. This has led to an intense clogging with a substantial reduction of the water volume held, so that, in 2006, the calculated volume for a height of 418 m was of 6. 47 million m 3, in the context of a relatively cleaned basin after the high floods of 2005 and 2006, generated by the evacuation operations. After the years 2007 and 2008, when no high floods were recorded and so no cleaning, but just massive storage of alluvial deposits, in 2009 the water volume at 418 m was just of 3. 59 million m 3, which gave birth to a clogging of about 63 % of the initial volume. The reasons leading to the clogging situation are: the change of the rivers’ slope in the upstream area, the increase of the river’s erosion level, its location downstream from the confluence with Ialomicioara Leaotei, with a hydrographic basin developed largely in the deforested Subcarpathian area, made up of easily <b>erodible</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

30|$|Estimating the {{sediment}} load in the Himalayan river basins is very challenging. Bruijnzeel and Bremmer ([1989]) suggest that {{the sediment}} loads from large river basins cannot be estimated accurately because of {{the wide range of}} <b>erodible</b> <b>materials</b> contributing sediment and the different methods used for estimation in different studies. Sharma ([1997]) indicated that nearly 135 million tons per year (t/year) of sediment is transported from the Koshi (sometimes written Kosi) river basin (about 57, 000 km 2), into the Ganges river. Laban ([1979]) cited in Tiwari ([2000]), reported a sediment load of about 119 million t/year in the same river, equivalent to 2 -mm topsoil depth over the entire catchment. The specific sediment yield was reported to be around 2, 500 t/km 2 /year (equivalent to 25 t/ha), which is very high compared to both the Ganges itself (491 t/km 2 /year) and other river systems in the world (for example, Brahmaputra 578, Amazon 207, and Nile 40 t/km 2 /year) (Alford [1992]; Mool et al. [2001]; Sharma [1997]). Even when the different size of the basin areas is taken into account, the sediment loads of the Himalayan rivers (Yellow, Ganges/Brahmaputra, Yangtze) are high compared to those {{in other parts of the}} world (Milliman and Meade [1983]). Among these, the Koshi river basin has an exceptionally high sediment-carrying capacity; although, it comprises only 5 % of the Ganges river basin area, it contributes nearly 25 % of the total sediment load (Sharma [1997]).|$|R
40|$|High {{sediment}} {{concentrations in}} runoff are a characteristic {{feature of the}} Chinese Loess Plateau, and are probably caused by {{factors such as the}} occurrence of <b>erodible</b> <b>materials</b> on steep slopes, the characteristics of the loess and the harsh climate that results in low plant cover. When sediment concentration increases, fluid density increases, viscosity increases and settling velocity decreases. These effects become increasingly important with increasing concentration and can result in flow behaviour that is quite different from that of clear water flow. Although the net effect of these changes on the flow is not always apparent, erosion models that deal with high sediment concentrations should consider such effects and could include corrections for some of these effects. A case study in a small catchment on the Loess Plateau indicated that sediment concentrations were considerable, and literature data suggested that for such sediment concentrations, corrections for settling velocity, fluid density and viscosity are needed. Furthermore, a number of corrections are necessary to be able to compare field measurements with results of soil erosion models: sediment volume should be subtracted from runoff volume and a density correction is needed to use data from a pressure transducer. For flumes that were used to measure discharge from smaller areas inside the catchment, the measured water level should be corrected by subtracting the sediment level in the flume from the water level, while the sediment volume should also be subtracted from the discharge. Finally, measured concentration should be corrected to give concentration expressed as grams per litre of clear water, since soil erosion models express sediment concentration in this way...|$|R

Understanding and quantifying sediment load is important in catchments draining highly <b>erodible</b> <b>materials</b> that eventually contribute to siltation of downstream reservoirs. Within this context, the suspended {{sediment transport}} and its temporal dynamics have been studied in the River Isabena (445 km(2), south-central Pyrenees, Ebro basin) by means of direct sampling and turbidity recording during a 3 -year dry period. The average flood-suspended sediment concentration was 8 g l(- 1). with maximum instantaneous values above 350 g l(- 1). The high scatter between discharge and suspended sediment concentrations (up to five orders of magnitude) has not permitted the use of rating curve methods to estimate the total load. Interpolation techniques yielded a mean annual sediment load of 184, 253 t y(- 1) for the study period, with a specific yield of 414 t km(- 2) y(- 1). This value resembles those reported for small torrents in nearby mountainous environments and {{is the result of}} the high connectivity between the badland source areas and stream courses, a fact that maximises sediment conveyance through the catchment. Floods dominated the sediment transport and yield. However, sediment transport was more constant through time than that observed in Mediterranean counterparts; this can be attributed to the role of base flows that entrain fine sediment temporarily stored in the channel and force the river to carry high sediment concentrations (i. e., generally in the order of 0. 5 g l(- 1)), even under minimum flow conditions.

Rainfall, runoff and {{sediment}} transport relations in a mesoscale mountainous catchment: The River Is?bena (Ebro basin). CATENA, 82 (1), 23 - 34. Sponsorship: Catalan Government and the European Social FundThis paper examines {{the relations between}} rainfall, runoff and suspended sediment transport in the Is?bena basin during a quasi-average hydrological year. The Is?bena is a mesoscale river basin that drains a mountainous area comprising patches of highly <b>erodible</b> <b>materials</b> (badlands). The paper includes {{an analysis of the}} different hydrological {{and sediment}}ary responses of the catchment to a similar rainfall. Thirty-four floods were studied, with a very variable response observed. Runoff coefficients ranged from 0. 32 % to 33 %. The sedimentary response was also highly variable, with maximum suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) oscillating between < 0. 1 and 90 g l? 1 and flood sediment loads varying from 27 to 54, 000 t per hydrological event. Most sediment load was concentrated in spring when competent floods occur frequently. Pearson correlation matrix and backward stepwise multiple regression indicate that the hydrological response of the catchment is strongly correlated with total precipitation, event duration, and rainfall of the previous days. Very low correlation was observed with rainfall intensity. The relation between rainfall and sediment transport followed the same trend. Sediment variables (e. g., total load and SSC) were significantly correlated with variables such as total rainfall and rainfall over the previous days, although the significance level was lower in comparison with the runoff related variables. There was again no correlation between sediment variables and rainfall intensity. On-going research in the area suggests that, apart from rainfall, factors such as sediment availability in the badlands and accumulation of sediment in the channels influences the river's sedimentary response. The non-linear hydrosedimentary response is reflected in the wide range of runoff coefficients and sediment loads that have been observed in response to similar amounts of precipitation.

40|$|Abstract: Dendrogeomorphological {{analyses}} of trees affected by debris flows have regularly {{been used to}} date past events. However, while previous studies in the Swiss Alps have focused primarily on granitic and gneissic debris-flow material and on Larix decidua Mill. and Picea abies (L.)

In this paper, we report on results obtained from a debris-flow cone in the Rhone valley (Valais, Switzerland) where very fine and muddy material (limestone, dolomite, quartzite and calcite) occasionally affects P. sylvestris trees. Based on the results of a geomorphic map, 1004 increment cores from 451 disturbed P. sylvestris, 37 L. decidua and five P. abies trees were sampled, allowing reconstruction of 15 events between AD 1793 and 2005 as well as the determination of breakout locations of events. From the data, it also appears that debris-flow material only rarely left the incised channel over the last 200 years and that overbank sedimentation events did not occur after 1961, when a rockslide delivered large amounts of <b>erodible</b> <b>material</b> and subsequent debris flows caused an important incision of the canyon on the cone...|$|E
30|$|Our monitoring-based {{study shows}} that {{sustained}} transportation of suspended volcaniclastic sediment occurred in the Akagawa–Nigorigawa River system for at least 19  months following even the very small (VEI 1 – 2) Ontake eruption of 2014. Two post-eruptive lahars removed erupted material as a potential sediment source in the upstream part of the Akagawa catchment, and this remobilization contributed {{to a decline in}} sediment supply in the Akagawa River after the lahars (Fig.  2 c). Remobilization of <b>erodible</b> volcanic <b>material</b> in river valleys during the early post-eruption phase of the 2000 eruption at Miyakejima was similarly a significant constraint on sediment discharge after that eruption (Yamakoshi et al. 2005). These findings suggest that a higher sediment supply will continue for a longer time period when only normal fluvial processes (without lahars) drive the erosion and transportation of eruptive material (Fig.  2 c). Increased turbidity was observed during the snowmelt season and was associated with diurnal variations in flow discharge and with the occurrence of rainstorm events up to 19  months after the eruption. This finding indicates that precipitation and snowmelt during early spring can cause fluctuations in sediment delivery after the eruption of a seasonally snow-clad volcano.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 This study {{examines}} stream channel erosion processes {{in a small}} urbanizing watershed influenced by deposits of the Columbia Basin catastrophic floods: Kelley Creek, a 12 -km² tributary of Johnson Creek, located just east of Portland, Oregon. Information on landscape history, stream channels, and sediment dynamics was compiled. The effects of future land use changes on stream channel response were projected. The likely effects of engineered solutions (stormwater management detention or infiltration facilities) are compared to land-use controls in mitigating the impact of future development on channel erosion. The geology of Kelley Creek is shaped by volcanic processes and Missoula floods, leading to fine-textured soils and streambeds that are susceptible to erosion. Headwaters are buttes of the Boring Lava formation overlain by Springwater Formation mudflow deposits. Alluvial silts deposited during late Pleistocene catastrophic floods mantle the low-relief valley floor. Land use in Kelley Creek transitioned from forestry to agriculture in the 20 th century, and more recently to urban expansion, increasing concerns of watershed managers about effects of development on sediment dynamics. Since 1930, land use on the valley floor of Kelley Creek {{has been dominated by}} nursery and berry agricultural production. Forested headwaters have been impacted by roads, culverts, and timber harvest. Seven percent of watershed area is currently impervious, with housing and commercial uses projected to increase following the incorporation of Kelley Creek into Portland's metropolitan urban growth boundary. Field surveys and engineering calculations were used to estimate sediment transport under current and future conditions in the watershed. Cross sectional geometry, slope and sediment size distributions were obtained from 15 locations in first to second-order channels in the watershed, and data were analyzed with sediment transport equations to simulate annual sediment transport rates given current and post-development flow patterns. Results indicate that the stream channel is most sensitive to altered discharge patterns where gravel-sized (D₅₀ > 10 mm) sediments currently are mobilized during annual peak events. In locations where fine (D₅₀ < 5 mm) particles dominate the stream bed, particles mobilize throughout the year and changes in discharge patterns do not increase the duration of transport or overall bedload yields. Because most of the sensitive locations with gravel sediments are located within or near the forested headwaters, preserving these headwater forests will protect sensitive stream channels as effectively as engineered stormwater retention or infiltration approaches. Kelley Creek's stream channel is still adjusting to recent mudflows and catastrophic floods, which provided abundant supplies of fine, <b>erodible</b> <b>materials.</b> Allowing this adjustment to continue without accelerating erosion in the face of rapid urban development poses an unusual challenge for managing geomorphic processes...|$|R
40|$|The Bodélé Depression, Chad is the planet's {{largest single}} source of dust. Deflation from the Bodélé {{could be seen}} as a simple {{coincidence}} of two key prerequisites: strong surface winds and a large source of suitable sediment. But here we hypothesise that long term links between topography, winds, deflation and dust ensure the maintenance of the dust source such that these two apparently coincidental key ingredients are connected by land-atmosphere processes with topography acting as the overall controlling agent. We use a variety of observational and numerical techniques, including a regional climate model, to show that: 1) contemporary deflation from the Bodélé is delineated by topography and a surface wind stress maximum; 2) the Tibesti and Ennedi mountains {{play a key role in}} the generation of the erosive winds in the form of the Bodélé Low Level Jet (LLJ); 3) enhanced deflation from a stronger Bodélé LLJ during drier phases, for example, the Last Glacial Maximum, was probably sufficient to create the shallow lake in which diatoms lived during wetter phases, such as the Holocene pluvial. Winds may therefore have helped to create the depression in which <b>erodible</b> diatom <b>material</b> accumulated. Instead of a simple coincidence of nature, dust from the world's largest source may result from the operation of long term processes on paleo timescales which have led to ideal conditions for dust generation in the world's largest dust source. Similar processes plausibly operate in other dust hotspots in topographic depressions...|$|R
