5|$|In 1517, Martin Luther, an Augustinian friar in Germany, {{sent his}} Ninety-Five Theses to several bishops. His theses protested key points of Catholic {{doctrine}} {{as well as}} the sale of indulgences. In Switzerland, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin and other Protestant Reformers further criticised Catholic teachings. These challenges developed into the European movement called the Protestant Reformation, which gave birth to a variety of Christian denominations known today collectively as Protestantism. The English Reformation during the reign of Henry VIII began as a political dispute. When the pope denied Henry's petition for a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>nullity</b> of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, he had the Acts of Supremacy passed, making him head of Church of England, forming Protestant Anglicanism.|$|E

5000|$|According to Canon 1095 a {{marriage}} can be declared null only when consent {{was given in}} the presence of some grave lack of discretionary judgment regarding the essential rights and obligations of marriage, or of some real incapacity to assume these essential obligations. Pope Benedict XVI in his address to the Roman Rota in 2009, echoing words of his predecessor John Paul II, has criticized [...] "the exaggerated and almost automatic multiplication <b>of</b> <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> marriage in cases of the failure of marriage on the pretext of some immaturity or psychic weakness {{on the part of the}} contracting parties". Calling for [...] "the reaffirmation of the innate human capacity for matrimony", he insisted on the point made in 1987 by John Paul II that [...] "only incapacity and not difficulty in giving consent invalidates {{a marriage}}".|$|R

2500|$|Early Medieval Europe {{continued}} the late Roman ban on cousin marriage; {{under the law}} of the Catholic Church, couples were forbidden to marry if they were within four degrees of consanguinity. In the ninth century, the church raised the number of prohibited degrees to seven and changed the method by which they were calculated. Eventually, the nobility became too interrelated to marry easily as the local pool of unrelated prospective spouses became smaller; increasingly, large payments to the church were required for exemptions ("dispensations"), or retrospective legitimizations of children, in what amounted to a 'protection racket' by the church. In 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council reduced the number of prohibited degrees of consanguinity from seven to four. The method of calculating prohibited degrees was changed also. [...] Instead of the former practice of counting up to the common ancestor then down to the proposed spouse, the new law computed consanguinity by counting back to the common ancestor. In the Roman Catholic Church, unknowingly marrying a closely consanguineous blood relative was grounds for a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>nullity,</b> but during the 11th and 12th centuries, dispensations were granted with increasing frequency due to the thousands of persons encompassed in the prohibition at seven degrees and the hardships this posed for finding potential spouses. After 1215, the general rule was that while fourth cousins could marry without dispensation, the need for dispensations was reduced.|$|E

In 1537 he was present at the christening of Prince Edward and the funeral of Jane Seymour; in 1538 he was at the {{reception}} of Anne <b>of</b> Cleves, the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> whose <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> marriage he afterwards signed. He liked to reside in his remote diocese; when in London, even after the dissolution, he seems to have stayed at Bermondsey.

40|$|The mutual {{recognition}} {{and acceptance of}} canon law and civil law have generated interesting debates through the centuries. This is particularly true since the Second Vatican Council called for {{a new way of}} thinking on matters pertaining to our religious way of life and on our relationship with other peoples and nations. As a result many pastorally important issues have surfaced. One of these is the possibility for the Church of recognizing and accepting a legitimate decision <b>of</b> the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> a marriage by a civil court. India, a secular country by constitution, accommodates many religions. The State recognizes the laws of all religious groups and acknowledges them as Personal Civil Laws, such as Indian Christian Marriage Act of 1872 and the Indian Divorce Act of 1869, governing matters such as marriage, succession, and divorce. Therefore, when carrying out any action which has consequences in civil law, every person is expected to observe his/her applicable personal civil law. According to the Church's teaching, marriage is indissoluble. However, the Church provides for a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> invalidity under strict conditions. A close examination of the ecclesial and civil laws indicates that, {{in order to protect the}} sacredness of this institution and to prevent invalid marriages, both systems have established a number of impediments and defects of consent which invalidate marriage ab initio. While Indian civil courts do not recognize the <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>nullity</b> granted by an ecclesiastical court, the Church does not accept a civil decree <b>of</b> <b>nullity</b> or <b>of</b> divorce. This particular confrontation between the two systems of laws naturally results in undue pain, tension and financial burdens for the persons involved. Therefore, we ask the question: Is it possible for the Church formally to accept a legitimately issued civil decree <b>of</b> <b>nullity</b> and allow the parties to marry in accordance with the norms of canon law without submitting them to a fresh new canonical trial? This question defines the hypothesis of our dissertation. Our study has demonstrated that there is substantial agreement between canon law and Indian civil law on several substantive aspects of marriage. For example, both hold that the right to marriage is a natural right of every human being. Both have established impediments in order to protect the social institution of marriage from being contracted invalidly. Both systems also recognize the invalidating effect of deceit. Once it is proven with moral certainty, or beyond reasonable doubt, that one party was deceitful in obtaining the consent of the other, both systems of law consider the marriage null and void. Therefore, at least in the case scenario discussed in our study, the Church can formally recognize and accept a civil <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> invalidity of a marriage and declare the parties involved free to enter upon a new canonical marriage according to the norms of canon law. We maintain that this conclusion, mutatis mutandis, can be applied also to other similar hypotheses...|$|R
40|$|The {{absence of}} a Romanian legal {{definition}} of the concept <b>of</b> <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> commercial companies arouses a lot of questions. The delimitation of this concept {{is very important for}} a correct establishment of its field of application. In other words, are the cases <b>of</b> <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> commercial companies regulated only by Law no. 31 / 1990 or by the provisions of common law as well? Started {{from the fact that the}} nullity is not considered by the legislator a simple sanction applicable to the juridical acts but it affects directly the existence of the company and becomes a means to sanction the creation of a legal person by disregarding the imperative legal provisions, we analyzed firstly the Romanian (II) and the EU legal provisions regarding the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> commercial companies. The elements of this analyze helped us to qualify the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> commercial companies and its effect (III). Finally, through the conclusion formulated we hope to call the attention on the fact that a company, even created through the non-observance of the legal rules, can be viable from economic point of view and it is senseless to make it disappearance. <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> commercial companies; <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> juridical acts; absolute nullity; relative nullity; <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> the commercial company’s nullity. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the {{juridical}} {{person is a}} notion without correspondence in the old civil law theory. In fact the regulation of the {{juridical person}} is a matter that enters relatively recent civil law because in traditional approach civil law dealt with natural persons and associations of natural persons only. The difference between the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the agreement of association and the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the juridical person itself, born by such association, is clearly revealed by the law. The two notions are still linked. One cannot imagine a <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the agreement without the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the legal person born by such agreement. Nevertheless the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the juridical person is laid down independently, comprising limited cases of occurrences. The regulation <b>of</b> the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the juridical person finds out its correspondence in the Company Law. The <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> {{the company has a}} distinct regulation, in Company Law, in line with the regulation <b>of</b> the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the juridical person. In this case the civil law imported the notion from commercial law in order to limit the incidences <b>of</b> the <b>nullity</b> aiming the security of the civil circuit and the interest of the third persons. In a general accepted way, nullity represents a civil sanction which impedes the effects of an act concluded in a way that breach the law.
