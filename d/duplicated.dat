However, in 2014 a new model {{was proposed in which}} salivary protein genes are <b>duplicated</b> and then restricted to the venom gland.

5|$|Through this weaving process, aspect weavers {{allow for}} code {{which would have}} {{otherwise}} been <b>duplicated</b> across classes. By eliminating this duplication, aspect weavers promote modularity of cross-cutting concerns. Aspects define the implementation code which would have otherwise been <b>duplicated</b> and then use pointcuts and join points to define the advice. During weaving, the aspect weaver uses the pointcuts and join points, known as a pointcut designator, to identify the positions in candidate classes at which the implementation should be injected. The implementation is then injected into the classes at the points identified, thus permitting the code to be executed at the appropriate times without relying on manual duplication by the programmer.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Finding <b>duplicates</b> is an {{important}} phase of systematic review. However, no consensus regarding the methods to find <b>duplicates</b> has been provided. This study aims to describe a pragmatic strategy of combining auto- and hand-searching <b>duplicates</b> in systematic review and to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of <b>duplicates.</b> METHODS AND FINDINGS: Literatures regarding portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) were searched by the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases. <b>Duplicates</b> included one index paper and one or more redundant papers. They were divided into type-I (<b>duplicates</b> among different databases) and type-II (<b>duplicate</b> publications in different journals/issues) <b>duplicates.</b> For type-I <b>duplicates,</b> reference items were further compared between index and redundant papers. Of 10936 papers regarding PVT, 2399 and 1307 were identified as auto- and hand-searched <b>duplicates,</b> respectively. The prevalence of auto- and hand-searched redundant papers was 11. 0 % (1201 / 10936) and 6. 1 % (665 / 10936), respectively. They included 3431 type-I and 275 type-II <b>duplicates.</b> Of 11403 papers regarding BCS, 3275 and 2064 were identified as auto- and hand-searched <b>duplicates,</b> respectively. The prevalence of auto- and hand-searched redundant papers was 14. 4 % (1640 / 11403) and 9. 1 % (1039 / 11403), respectively. They included 5053 type-I and 286 type-II <b>duplicates.</b> Most of type-I <b>duplicates</b> were identified by auto-searching method (69. 5 %, 2385 / 3431 in PVT literatures; 64. 6 %, 3263 / 5053 in BCS literatures). Nearly all type-II <b>duplicates</b> were identified by hand-searching method (94. 9 %, 261 / 275 in PVT literatures; 95. 8 %, 274 / 286 in BCS literatures). Compared with those identified by auto-searching method, type-I <b>duplicates</b> identified by hand-searching method had a significantly higher prevalence of wrong items (47 / 2385 versus 498 / 1046, p< 0. 0001 in PVT literatures; 30 / 3263 versus 778 / 1790, p< 0. 0001 in BCS literatures). Most of wrong items originated from EMBASE database. CONCLUSION: Given the inadequacy of a single strategy of auto-searching method, a combined strategy of auto- and hand-searching methods should be employed to find <b>duplicates</b> in systematic review...|$|R

40|$|Different {{modes of}} gene {{duplication}} including whole-genome duplication (WGD), and tandem, proximal and dispersed duplications are widespread in angiosperm genomes. Small-scale, stochastic gene relocations and transposed gene duplications are widely accepted {{to be the}} primary mechanisms for the creation of dispersed <b>duplicates.</b> However, here we show that most surviving ancient dispersed <b>duplicates</b> in core eudicots originated from large-scale gene relocations within a narrow window of time following a genome triplication (γ) event that occurred in the stem lineage of core eudicots. We name these surviving ancient dispersed <b>duplicates</b> as relocated γ <b>duplicates.</b> In Arabidopsis thaliana, relocated γ, WGD and single-gene <b>duplicates</b> have distinct features with regard to gene functions, essentiality, and protein interactions. Relative to γ <b>duplicates,</b> relocated γ <b>duplicates</b> have higher non-synonymous substitution rates, but comparable levels of expression and regulation divergence. Thus, relocated γ <b>duplicates</b> should be distinguished from WGD and single-gene <b>duplicates</b> for evolutionary investigations. Our results suggest large-scale gene relocations following the γ event were associated with the diversification of core eudicots...|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} to S. cerevisiae and C. elegans, analyses {{based on the}} current knockout (KO) mouse phenotypes led {{to the conclusion that}} <b>duplicate</b> genes had almost no role in mouse genetic robustness. It has been suggested that the bias of mouse KO database toward ancient <b>duplicates</b> may possibly cause this knockout <b>duplicate</b> puzzle, that is, a very similar proportion of essential genes (PE) between <b>duplicate</b> genes and singletons. In this paper, we conducted an extensive and careful analysis for the mouse KO phenotype data and corroborated a strong effect of <b>duplicate</b> genes on mouse genetics robustness. Moreover, the effect of <b>duplicate</b> genes on mouse genetic robustness is duplication-age dependent, which holds after ruling out the potential confounding effect from coding-sequence conservation, protein-protein connectivity, functional bias, or the bias of <b>duplicates</b> generated by whole genome duplication (WGD). Our findings suggest that two factors, the sampling bias toward ancient <b>duplicates</b> and very ancient <b>duplicates</b> with a proportion of essential genes higher than that of singletons, have caused the mouse knockout <b>duplicate</b> puzzle; meanwhile, the effect of genetic buffering may be correlated with sequence conservation as well as protein-protein interactivity...|$|R

40|$|Deleting a <b>duplicate</b> gene {{often results}} in a less severe {{phenotype}} than deleting a singleton gene, a phenomenon commonly attributed to functional compensation among <b>duplicates.</b> However, <b>duplicate</b> genes rapidly diverge in expression patterns after duplication, making functional compensation less probable for ancient <b>duplicates.</b> Case studies suggested that a gene may provide compensation by altering its expression upon removal of its <b>duplicate</b> copy.

Here we reanalyze the yeast data and show that the high dispensability of <b>duplicate</b> genes with low expression similarity is a consequence of expression similarity and gene dispensability, each being correlated with a third factor, the number of protein interactions per gene.
