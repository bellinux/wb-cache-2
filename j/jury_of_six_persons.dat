50|$|State v. Jones, 2003-1345 (La. App. 1st Cir. 9/24/04), 888 So.2d 885 - A divided First Circuit en banc {{court upheld}} the trial court’s {{conviction}} of a defendant {{for a fourth}} offense DWI. Writing in a separate concurrence, Judge Kuhn addressed the posture of the dissenting opinion, which maintained that the Supreme Court’s holding in State v. Smith, 367 So.2d 857 (La. 1979), required the First Circuit, on its own motion, {{to find that the}} verdict rendered by a twelve-person jury constituted patent error. Pointing out that the defendant, who was entitled to a jury before six people, had been tried by a twelve-person jury created no prejudice and did not infringe defendant's due process safeguards. Judge Kuhn emphasized the lack of prejudice because the twelve-person jury had rendered a unanimous verdict. Reviewing the First Circuit’s affirmance of the conviction, the Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the defendant’s conviction by a unanimous twelve-person jury, rather than by <b>jury</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> <b>persons</b> as required by state constitution, was subject to harmless error analysis and that the defendant’s conviction by unanimous jury of 12 persons was harmless error beyond reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court also held that the empanelling of jury composed of a greater number of persons than constitutionally required did not constitute a non-waivable jurisdictional defect subject to automatic nullity and abrogated its earlier decision in State v. Smith, 367 So.2d 857 (among other decisions). See State v. Jones, 2005-0226 (La. 2/22/06), 922 So.2d 508.|$|E
