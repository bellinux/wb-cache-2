50|$|The ligule {{is part of}} {{the leaf}} that is found at the {{junction}} of the blade and sheath of the leaf. It may take several forms, but it is commonly some form of translucent membrane or a fringe of hairs. The membranous ligule can be very short 1 - 2 mm (Kentucky bluegrass, Poa pratensis) to very long 10 - 20 mm (Johnson <b>grass,</b> <b>Sorghum</b> halepense), it can also be smooth on the edge or very ragged. Some grasses do not have a ligule, for example barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli).|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} types of sorghum such as grain sorghum, <b>grass</b> <b>sorghum,</b> sweet sorghum and broomcorn. Grain Sorghum usually requires less water than other crops such as maize, and produces higher yields in hotter areas such as Africa and Asia. Nepal’s climate ranges from tropical to a more arctic climate depending on the altitude. The Terai region of Nepal is a {{southern part of the}} country and tends to be more tropical with a hot, humid climate. This is prime for the growth of Sorghum. Sorghum is well adapted to dryer climates and tolerates hot climates better than maize or soybeans. It is a warm season grass and has adapted to grow {{in a wide range of}} soil types often tolerating waterlogging and many poor soil types.|$|E
50|$|The main {{threat to}} the species is the loss and {{degradation}} of its habitat, caused {{in part by the}} invasion of non-native plant species and the overgrowth of native plants. The worst invasive species is Johnson <b>grass</b> (<b>Sorghum</b> halepense). The orchid grows naturally next to various species of horse-tail and other marsh plants, and when these plants become too dense the orchid cannot penetrate the layers of vegetation. Horse-tails also outcompete the orchid. It is likely that fire suppression is a threat, as fires naturally thin competing vegetation. Grazing of cattle and other livestock is a threat, though grazing has been eliminated in the most sensitive cienega sites in most locations. Changes in the hydrology of these wetland sites is a {{threat to the}} habitat, which is still recovering from draining operations initiated over a century ago. Pumping of groundwater reduces available water in the habitat.|$|E

5000|$|The {{approach}} {{relies on}} a combination of companion crops to be planted around and among maize or sorghum. Both domestic and wild grasses can help to protect the crops by attracting and trapping the stemborers. The grasses are planted in the border around the maize and sorghum fields where invading adult moths become attracted to chemicals emitted by the grasses themselves. Instead of landing on the maize or sorghum plants, the insects head for {{what appears to be a}} tastier meal. These grasses provide the [...] "pull" [...] in the [...] "push-pull" [...] strategy. They also serve as a haven for the borers' natural enemies. Good trap crops include well-known grasses such as Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and Sudan <b>grass</b> (<b>Sorghum</b> vulgare sudanense). Napier grass has a particularly effective way of defending itself against the pests: once attacked by a borer larva, it secretes a sticky substance which physically traps the pest and limits its damage.|$|E

This effect appeared, however, to be characteristic of chilling‐susceptible plant species {{and was not}} observed in plants which {{are known to be}} chilling‐tolerant, indicating that the measurement of qQ can serve in practice to estimate rapidly the relative chilling tolerance of crop plants. A large number (28) of sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and Sudan <b>grass</b> (<b>Sorghum</b> sudanense) genotypes were screened for chilling tolerance using this rapid qQ method. Although sweet sorghum and sudan grass obviously behaved as chilling‐sensitive plants, a considerable variation for chilling susceptibility was observed among the different genotypes tested. Some sweet sorghum varieties, such as ‘Dale’ and ‘Keller’, and most of the sudan grass varieties appeared to possess a certain degree of resistance towards low temperature stress, indicating the existence of useful germplasms in Sorghum for improving stress tolerance.

Further, shattercanes are of two types: those that form an abscission callus, and those with a fragile rachis. Many offtypes that exhibit the common morphological characteristics of midwestern shattercanes but do not shatter are also found in and near farm field.

40|$|In eastern Africa, farmers plant napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) or Sudan <b>grass</b> (<b>Sorghum</b> vulgare sudanese) as a trap weed in maize. The stem borer, {{accountable}} {{for up to}} 30 % yield losses in maize, prefers these grasses to maize. Two other weeds are planted that repel stemborers: molasses grass (Melinis minutifolia) or the silver-leafed desmodium (Desmodium uncinatum). The trick is to plant repellent weeds in the maize field to chase out the stemborers, and to plant the trap weed {{on the edges of}} the field. The stemborers are caught in the sticky substance that these trap weeds produce. Both napier and Sudan grass are also used as fodder. Molasses grass not only repels stemborers but also ticks. Nonetheless, desmodium seems to excel its colleagues in usefulness. It fixes nitrogen in the soil, is an important source of fodder, repels stemborers and most surprisingly: it turns out to repel the noxious weed striga too (see other box). During trials, as much as 40 times less striga was found in the desmodium maize fields, compared to mono-cropped maize. The International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology, based in Nairobi, developed, tested and disseminated the combined intercropping system. It has caught on extremely well. Farmers both smallholder and large commercial from Ethiopia to Tanzania are now planting desmodium in their maize. One spin-off effect of this popularity is that selling desmodium seed has become an emerging income-generating opportunity. In Togo and Benin, Mucuna spp. have been brought into action as cover crops to restore the fertility of arable land and reduce weed infestation. It has caught on especially in areas of high rural population density, where land pressure is high and periods of fallow are not long enough. Growing mucuna during the improved fallowing suppresses spear grass infestation (Imperata cylindrica) but it is also grown intercropped with maize. The technique is spreading fast and mucuna seed sales are a booming business.

30|$|In {{the most}} {{comprehensive}} comparisons to date, between rice and two panicoid <b>grasses,</b> <b>sorghum</b> and maize, the frequency of gene movement over the last fifty million years was calculated as at least 5 %, and possibly as high as 25 %, between sorghum and rice [53]. This number {{does not include the}} gain or loss of tandemly repeated gene copies, a very common phenomenon in all grass lineages investigated. Most of the genic rearrangements in maize compared to either rice or sorghum are apparent gene losses on one of two maize homoeologues [40, 53], an expected outcome of the polyploidization event about five mya that gave rise to the Zea lineage [80]. However, too little data yet exist to identify possible subtle patterns in types of rearrangement. Moreover, rearrangements involving genes are likely to be under selective pressure, so the events currently observed in any species are a combined outcome of those events that have occurred, minus those that were subsequently removed by chance or by selection against some specific changes.|$|R
