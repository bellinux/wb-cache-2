5|$|During the Labour {{leadership}} campaign, {{he described}} himself as a socialist, and spoke out against some of the actions of the Blair ministry, including criticising its record on civil liberties and foreign policy. Though he was not yet an MP {{at the time of the}} 2003 vote, Miliband was a strong critic of the Iraq War. <b>He</b> <b>backed</b> UK military action and intervention in Afghanistan and Libya respectively.|$|E
5|$|He {{was known}} for his support of {{representative}} democracy and his populist style. For example, he would hold town halls and let constituents vote on motions to decide what he would do in Congress on their behalf and these meetings helped Bedell understand the problems of his constituents; as a result, <b>he</b> <b>backed</b> issues that were important to his farming constituency, such as waterway usage fees and production constraints.|$|E

He cited personal and health issues for not making the race. In 2000, <b>he</b> <b>backed</b> the presidential campaign of Senator John McCain. Nunn reconciled with his son, and when Steve ran for governor in 2003, Louie supported him. After Steve Nunn ran third in a four-way primary, the elder Nunn supported the Republican nominee, Ernie Fletcher, hosting a fundraiser for him.|$|E
5|$|In May, Jarrah {{received}} a visa from the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, arriving in Florida in June 2000. There, he began taking flying lessons {{as well as}} training in hand-to-hand combat. Jarrah maintained contact with his girlfriend in Germany and {{with his family in}} Lebanon in the months preceding the attacks. This close contact upset Mohamed Atta, the tactical leader of the plot, and al-Qaeda planners may have considered another operative, Zacarias Moussaoui, to replace him if <b>he</b> <b>backed</b> out.|$|E

5|$|Youtsey, who {{received}} a life sentence, did not appeal, but after two years in prison, he turned state's evidence. In Howard's second trial, Youtsey claimed that ex-governor Taylor had discussed an assassination plot with Youtsey and Howard. <b>He</b> <b>backed</b> the prosecution's claims that Taylor and Powers worked out the details, he acted as an intermediary, and Howard fired the shot. On cross examination, the defense pointed out contradictions {{in the details of}} Youtsey's story, but Howard was still convicted. Youtsey was paroled in 1916 and was pardoned in 1919 by Democratic governor James D. Black.|$|E
5|$|According to Pyun, {{the idea}} of Max Havoc has existed since at least 2001. At the time, {{he was asked to}} direct the film in Hawaii. After the September 11 attacks, it was decided that filming in Miami was more {{economically}} viable. Pyun said that Hawaiian film star Mark Dacascos was interested in playing the character of Max Havoc, but that <b>he</b> <b>backed</b> out after anthrax appeared in Florida. Bali was considered next for filming but the idea was abandoned after the terrorist bombing there in 2002. The director and producer settled on filming on Guam, voicing their interest to Guam officials in late 2003. Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon {{was supposed to be the}} first of two films to act as a backdoor pilot into a Max Havoc television series.|$|E

5|$|Arana's support {{began to}} be {{solicited}} by the landed elite, who felt threatened by Arévalo's reforms. Arana, who was not initially inclined {{to get involved with}} politics, began to make occasional statements against the government. In the 1948 parliamentary election, <b>he</b> <b>backed</b> a number of opposition candidates, all of whom were defeated. By 1949 the National Renovation Party and the PAR were both openly hostile to Arana, while a small fragment of the Popular Liberation Front split off to support him. The leftist parties decided to back Árbenz instead, as they believed that only a military officer could defeat Arana.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{studied at}} Plato's Academy in Athens, {{remaining}} {{there for some}} 17 years. Like Plato, he sought universals in his philosophy, but unlike Plato <b>he</b> <b>backed</b> up his views with detailed observation, notably of {{the natural history of}} the island of Lesbos and the marine life in the island's lagoon at Pyrrha. This study made him the earliest natural historian whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on zoology was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for some two thousand years. His writings on zoology form about a quarter of his surviving work. Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus later wrote a similar book on botany, Enquiry into Plants.|$|E
5|$|At the war's end in 1945, Ull {{only had}} {{fourteen}} members. Its average member age was lowered to 65 {{years after the}} admission of five new members in 1946 and 1947. The post-war period also saw the admission to SK Ull of men from more professional groups. One of the new members, Erik Plahte, would serve as chairman from 1951 to 1973, when <b>he</b> <b>backed</b> down {{at the age of}} 84. Another of the new post-war members, Jakob Vaage, took over. He was then aged 68. By 1953, all the club's elected positions were held by post-war members. Three of the older members, some with experience dating to the 1880s, were admitted as honorary members, the first honorary members in SK Ull since 1889.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} time, the Italian Grand Prix {{was held at}} the Livorno Circuit rather than the {{traditional}} venue of Monza. Caracciola took pole position, and despite two false starts caused by spectators pouring onto the track, held his lead {{for the majority of the}} race and won from his teammate Lang by just 0.4seconds. In doing so Caracciola clinched the European Championship for the second time. <b>He</b> <b>backed</b> up the win with another at the Masaryk Grand Prix two weeks later. He trailed Rosemeyer for much of the race until the Auto Union skidded against a kerb and allowed the Mercedes into the lead.|$|E
5|$|Goldschmidt drew {{criticism}} {{in recent years}} for some of his business activities. In 2002, he lobbied business and political leaders to support Weyerhaeuser in its hostile takeover of Willamette Industries, Inc., then the only Fortune 500 company headquartered in Portland. In early 2004, <b>he</b> <b>backed</b> a purchase of Portland General Electric (PGE) by Texas Pacific Group which, though never consummated, put on hold city and county studies to acquire PGE by condemnation. Criticism of Goldschmidt's business activities peaked when, on November 13, 2003, Governor Ted Kulongoski nominated him to the Oregon State Board of Higher Education.|$|E
5|$|He {{started his}} {{professional}} career between 1803 and 1804, {{in the office}} of Augustine Gascón, officiating as labour counselor for Indians. As a result, he confronted powerful people like the mayors of Cochabamba and Chayanta. He left the city after being threatened, and returned to Buenos Aires in 1805 with his wife Maria Guadalupe Cuenca and their newborn son. Once in the city, he became a reporter of the hearings of the Royal Audiencia, a local appeal court. The Buenos Aires Cabildo, the local council, hired him as an advisor as well. He defended Melchor Fernández, aggrieved by Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, in one of his first cases. In another of his early disputes <b>he</b> <b>backed</b> the Cabildo in denying the appointment as an ensign of the young Bernardino Rivadavia.|$|E
