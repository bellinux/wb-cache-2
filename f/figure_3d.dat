Very similarly, the loosest pod-like nanoarchitecture 4 (Figure 2 h, D 104 = 31.3 nm) exhibited a relatively low adsorbance of N 2 (<b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> d 1) with also a narrow hysteresis loop at a relative pressure P/P 0 of 0.25 to 0.95 {{as well as a}} quasi-bimodal pore diameter distribution (<b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> d 2). It was worth noting that the broad hysteresis loop (<b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> a 1) and relative narrow one (<b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> b 1) were due to the strong and weak capillarity phenomena existing within the compact (Figure 2 d) and relatively loose nanoarchitectures (Figure 2 e), respectively. Moreover, the characteristic H 3 -type hysteresis loop (<b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> b 1) indicated the existence of dominant slit pores and channels with a relatively uniform shape and size within the relatively loose pod-like nanoarchitectures (Figure 2 e,f). This was in accordance with the SEM observation (Figure 1 c) and literature results [45, 46].

30|$|The 2 D {{nature of}} the {{structures}} {{in the study area}} is also constrained by the shapes of phase-tensor ellipses and induction arrows (<b>Figure</b> <b>3).</b> The major axes of the phase-tensor ellipses obtained at 9.4 Hz are roughly parallel to the survey line, and the ratios of major to minor axes lengths are generally large (<b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> a). In contrast, these ellipses become more circular at higher frequencies (see 1, 100 Hz in <b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> c). In addition, real induction arrows (Parkinson 1962; <b>Figure</b> <b>3),</b> which intrinsically tend to point toward lower resistivity areas, do not appear to have any preferential orientation or length at high frequencies (1, 100 Hz; <b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> c). In comparison, the arrows obtained for lower frequency data (97 Hz and 9.4 Hz; <b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> a,b) point toward {{the central part of the}} study area. This suggests that the resistivity structure has lateral variations parallel to the survey line at depths corresponding to the low frequency data obtained during this study.|$|R
30|$|As mentioned, we {{make use}} of {{molecular}} dynamics simulations and DFT calculations of conductance to understand these experimental measurements and observations. Figure 2 shows the two structures studied using MD, as described earlier. In <b>Figure</b> <b>3,</b> we show some snapshots of the configurations found just after the contact between the two tips and just before breaking a nanocontact. Three basic atomic structures are found: a monomer (<b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> A), a dimer (<b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> B) and a double contact (D.C.) (<b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> C,D,E).

We define a double dimeric contact as the one where the contact is between two atoms facing two other atoms, while we define a double monomeric contact as a contact where two atoms are contacting each other. Another interesting point is that for the double dimeric contact, we have identified two possible structures: one where two atoms are perpendicular to the other two (<b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> C), which we call transversal configuration (D.C. Dimeric T), and one where two atoms are parallel to the other two (<b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> D), which we call parallel configuration (D.C. Dimeric P).|$|R

We also investigated {{the influence of the}} resident time that the source temperature stays at the peak temperature (570 °C) on film thickness. We compare two samples, <b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> a, d, where each has an identical saw-toothed heating profile. The sample in <b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> a has 1 s of resident time at 570 °C, while that of <b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> d has 5 s of resident time at 570 °C. Our results show that there is {{no significant difference in the}} thicknesses between these two samples, and the differences are within the range of errors - the sample in <b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> a has a nominal thickness of 25 nm, while the sample in <b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> d has a nominal thickness of 22 nm. As shown, there are no noticeable differences in the thicknesses despite the fact that the sample in <b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> d has four more seconds at the peak temperature. This shows that the total duration the source temperature stays above 420 °C, instead of at the peak temperature of 570 °C, plays a more critical role in influencing the thicknesses of the films. Furthermore, when comparing <b>Figures</b> <b>3</b> d and e, the effect of the duration the source stays above 420 °C becomes more obvious - longer synthesis time above 420 °C leads to thickening of the film (to 57 nm) as shown in <b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> e, the sample which is exposed to 70 s longer than the sample in <b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> d. It is evident that film thickness is predominantly influenced by the heating duration at or above the melting point of zinc and, to a minimal extent, by changes in the resident time at the peak temperature. The evidence indicates that heating to just above 420 °C is sufficient to allow deposition to occur in the argon-plasma environment. The grain sizes also appear to increase from an average grain diameter of 44 nm to 75 nm as synthesis duration increases from 135 s to 445 s.|$|R
