5|$|Wagener County Park {{is located}} off M-25 in the {{community}} of Helena. M-25 begins to curve to the northwest in Sand Beach near the Rock Falls Cemetery. In the city of Harbor Beach, M-25 is called Huron Avenue and meets M-142 for the first of two occasions. Here is the Harbor Beach Golf Course {{on the south side of}} town as M-25 moves inland through town. North of town, the trunkline parallels an old routing of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway as it is once again renamed Lakeshore Road. The highway moves farther inland north of Rubicon and Port Hope as it begins to round the tip of the Thumb. In <b>Grindstone</b> City, M-25 loses the Lakeshore Road name in favor of <b>Grindstone</b> Road all the way to Port Austin.|$|E
5|$|Windy Nook {{has a long}} {{industrial}} history, {{with evidence}} of milling and pottery in the area. The principal industry, however, was stone quarrying, and the initial settlement grew as this industry flourished. By {{the turn of the}} 20th century, several quarries operated in Windy Nook and the largest, Kell's Quarry, provided the sandstone and <b>grindstone</b> used to build St Alban's Church, a Grade II listed building and principal landmark in the village, which was consecrated on 25 August 1842.|$|E

In 1834 a second large {{chemical}} works {{was established by}} Hugh Lee Pattinson, John Lee and George Burnett; it soon employed around 300 men. <b>Grindstone</b> quarries produced high quality stone and a brownware pottery under Mr. Joseph Wood had opened for business. In 1842, Brandling Station was opened at Mullbery Street in Felling on the Brandling Junction railway linking Gateshead, South Shields and Sunderland. This {{is one of the}} oldest passenger stations in the world.|$|E

5|$|Most ancient Egyptians were farmers {{tied to the}} land. Their {{dwellings}} were {{restricted to}} immediate family members, and were constructed of mud-brick designed to remain cool {{in the heat of}} the day. Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a <b>grindstone</b> for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread. Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed mats, while wooden stools, beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture.|$|E
5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived {{in when he}} first came to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck with the idea of attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands of wire they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to crimp the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the pins and turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How to crimp the barbs to the wire was solved, in the barn, by tying one end of the wire and another length of wire to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the wires to a <b>grindstone.</b> The <b>grindstone</b> was used to twist the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E

25|$|As more {{settlers}} {{arrived and}} cleared the land, cash crops replaced subsistence farming. Gradually, mixed farming and market gardens became the dominant form of agriculture, {{and in the}} early 20th century the area was declared the Garden of Canada. The first peaches grown in Canada were cultivated in the <b>Grindstone</b> Creek watershed in the city's south-west part. The farming tradition has passed down through the generations. Today over forty percent of the <b>Grindstone</b> Creek watershed is still devoted to farms, orchards and nurseries.|$|E

25|$|The {{next step}} was {{introduction}} of a new pulp process, thermomechanical pulp (TMP), replacing the former <b>grindstone</b> mechanical pulping. TMP allowed for more long fibers to be retained, thus improving the strength. This allowed for cellulose content to be dropped from fifteen percent, which would allow for cost-savings along with faster processing through the paper machines. The first TMP machine was installed in 1977, with a daily capacity of 120 tonnes.|$|E
25|$|Mary Island and Canoe Point {{were both}} {{purchased}} in 1897; the remainder were acquired in 1898. Among the early locations intended {{for inclusion in}} the reservation was a peninsula known as Cement Point on <b>Grindstone</b> Island; however it was eventually declined by the state due to uncertainty regarding its legal ownership. These purchases were some of the earliest actions taken by New York State to preserve lands for recreational purposes, preceded only by the protection of the Forest Preserve and the Niagara Reservation.|$|E
25|$|Egyptian bread {{was made}} almost {{exclusively}} from emmer wheat, {{which was more}} difficult to turn into flour than most other varieties of wheat. The chaff does not come off through threshing, but comes in spikelets {{that needed to be}} removed by moistening and pounding with a pestle to avoid crushing the grains inside. It was then dried in the sun, winnowed and sieved and finally milled on a saddle quern, which functioned by moving the <b>grindstone</b> back and forth, rather than with a rotating motion.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>grindstones</b> were {{excavated}} so {{that the}} block of stone was in one piece and more or less already shaped underneath on the outside. Thus each of them left a round or oval hollow, or imprint, {{on the surface of}} rock it came from. These [...] "negative imprints" [...] are found all over the surface of the stone quarried, following the relief and remodelling it. Thus their disposition varies with said relief. These traces of extraction are the means by which <b>grindstones</b> quarries are identified.|$|R
25|$|A TMP mill was {{installed}} 1977, {{but not until}} a series of upgrades were completed in 1992 could the former <b>grindstone</b> production be scrapped {{and the need to}} buy sulfite cellulose could be dropped. PM3 became operational on 23 June 1981. The machines have been through several major upgrades, the most extensive in the late 1980s and early 2000s. A deinking mill became operational in June 2000. Proposals for PM4, which would have produced magazine paper, were abandoned after the plans to build a gas-powered on-site thermal power plant were scrapped by Industrikraft Midt-Norge.|$|E

Leicestershire's bowlers were smashed to all corners, Phil DeFreitas the only one who escaped with some respectability as he took two for 50 in eleven overs. Gibson, Leicestershire's best performer of the first innings, conceded 124 for no wicket the second time around.|$|E
25|$|The Malvern Roller Mill {{was added}} to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on August 4, 1995 because of its local {{significance}} in the areas of industry and commerce. The building operated as a grinding mill for farmers and the nearby community of Malvern from its construction until it closed in 1942. It is the only known mill in northwestern Illinois that retains all of its equipment for an all roller and no <b>grindstone</b> process. If the millrace and turbines are clean the mill could operate as it did when it was in business. The Malvern Roller Mill provides a glimpse at the complexity of late 19th century milling operations.|$|E

25|$|The crank became {{common in}} Europe {{by the early}} 15th century, seen {{in the works of}} those such as the {{military}} engineer Konrad Kyeser (1366after 1405). A rotary <b>grindstone</b> − the earliest representation thereof − which is operated by a crank handle is shown in the Carolingian manuscript Utrecht Psalter; the pen drawing of around 830 goes back to a late antique original. A musical tract ascribed to the abbot Odo of Cluny (ca. 878−942) describes a fretted stringed instrument which was sounded by a resined wheel turned with a crank; the device later appears in two 12th century illuminated manuscripts. There are also two pictures of Fortuna cranking her wheel of destiny from this and the following century.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{original}} attractions are outside {{the gates of the}} current-day theme park along Grand Ave. at the California Marketplace, mostly things which would no longer be considered interesting to today's audience, or things which were merely there for decoration. Near the restrooms behind Berry Place are the waterfall overshooting the water wheel and historic gristmill <b>grindstone,</b> a replica of George Washington's Mount Vernon estate fireplace hearth, and what remains of the visible beehive. Some attractions still exist, but have been incorporated into backstage areas, such as the Rock Garden, now an employee smoking area. Other attractions have been removed, such as the historic volcano, and the cross-section of giant sequoia with age rings denoting historic events such as Christopher Columbus visiting America.|$|E
25|$|After the Union army {{seized the}} {{crossing}} at <b>Grindstone</b> Ford, any Confederate forces between the Big Bayou Pierre and the Big Black River were compromised. Realizing this, Bowen evacuated Grand Gulf and proceeded with all speed to Hankinson's Ford across the Big Black, barely escaping the Union trap. Grant's intention {{at this time}} was to move north over this same route and advance directly on Vicksburg. However, scouting parties that he sent out found that Pemberton had good defensive positions {{to the south of}} the city. Instead, he decided to break the city's supply line by seizing the railroad from Jackson to Vicksburg. He gave orders for his three corps (Sherman having arrived across the river) to advance over three separate routes to attack the railroad at Edwards Station (the westernmost objective, with McClernand's corps), Clinton (easternmost, with McPherson's) and Midway Station (center, with Sherman's).|$|E
50|$|Some {{sandstones}} {{are resistant}} to weathering, yet are easy to work. This makes sandstone a common building and paving material including in asphalt concrete. However, some {{that have been used}} in the past, such as the Collyhurst sandstone used in North West England, have been found less resistant, necessitating repair and replacement in older buildings. Because of the hardness of individual grains, uniformity of grain size and friability of their structure, some types of sandstone are excellent materials from which to make <b>grindstones,</b> for sharpening blades and other implements. Non-friable sandstone {{can be used to make}} <b>grindstones</b> for grinding grain, e.g., gritstone.|$|R
