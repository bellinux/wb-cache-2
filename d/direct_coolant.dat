40|$|CO 2 hydrate slurry is a {{favourable}} <b>direct</b> <b>coolant</b> {{of fresh}} products {{due to its}} large latent heat and phase change temperature around 5 Â°C. Continuous production of this slurry is, however, difficult to realise due to {{the high rate of}} hydrate formation. The use of additives is proposed with the purpose of decreasing the formation rate so that the controllability of the process is improved. Type-III Antifreeze Proteins (AFPs) are non-poisonous additives which have proven to be inhibitors of hydrate formation. These additives have also shown to protect the bio-cells of fresh products from damaging by freezing. The effect of these additives on the CO 2 hydrate formation rate is experimentally investigated. The experiments have been performed in a coil heat exchanger with 6 mm internal diameter under operating conditions corresponding to hydrate formation conditions. The concentration of Type-III AFPs has been varied: no additives, 5 ppm and 10 ppm. The mixture of additives and CO 2 -water solution is cooled down until the hydrate formation conditions are attained. The growth rate of hydrates {{on the wall of the}} heat exchanger has been derived from the variation of the overall heat transfer coefficient with time. Results show that the addition of AFPs changes the supersaturation degree of CO 2 water solution needed to initiate the hydrate formation process. A low concentration of the proposed additives is sufficient to slow down the formation rate of CO 2 hydrate improving significantly the controllability of the hydrate production process...|$|E
40|$|Reactor vessel {{internals}} are structures {{located within}} the reactor vessel that support and orient the reactor fuel assemblies and <b>direct</b> <b>coolant</b> flow through the core. The core basket {{is part of the}} internals structure, which consists of vertical plates that surround the outer faces of the hexagonal peripheral fuel assemblies. The vertical plates are bolted to the edges of horizontal former plates that are bolted to the inside surface of the core basket. There are typically four levels of former plates located at various elevations within the core basket of a VVER- 440 reactor. The bolts that secure the baffle plates to the former plates are referred to as "baffle former bolts. Nuclear power plants identified the cracking of baffle former bolts as early as 1988 and this problem continues to occur. Although this cracking is not fully understood, testing of cracked bolts suggests an age-related intergranular stress-corrosion cracking process influenced by bolt material, fluence, stress, and temperature. Inspection and replacement of baffle former bolts have been carried out successfully at the Loviisa NPP Unit 2 in early September 2006. In particular, {{this is the first time}} that bolts replacement is performed in a VVER- 440 reactor type. Ultrasonic testing was used to assess the integrity of the baffle former bolts. Subsequently some defective bolts were replaced with a remotely controlled underwater manipulator system, as a preventive maintenance measure. This work is a further step in the application of a complex Western PWR technology to VVER reactors type...|$|E
40|$|A {{rotary engine}} has a {{substantially}} trochoidal-shaped housing cavity {{in which a}} rotor planetates. A cooling system for the engine <b>directs</b> <b>coolant</b> along a single series path consisting of series connected groups of passages. Coolant enters near the intake port, passes downwardly and axially through the cooler regions of the engine, then passes upwardly and axially through the hotter regions. By first flowing through the coolest regions, coolant pressure is reduced, thus reducing the saturation temperature of the coolant and thereby enhancing the nucleate boiling heat transfer mechanism which predominates in the high heat flux region of the engine during high power level operation...|$|R

The system utilizes a plastic insert cold plate design to provide even cooling over the backside of a power electronics device by <b>directing</b> <b>coolant</b> through parallel serpentine channels. Material selection and compression set testing evaluated suitable elastomers for seals and polymers for the plastic insert. Computational fluid dynamics software {{was used to evaluate}} the thermal performance of the cooling system under ideal conditions as well as various wear out conditions (e. g. channel blockage, erosion of channel walls). Properties of used 50 / 50 ethylene glycol water coolant were evaluated to discover additional causes of reduced thermal performance. After completing the cooling system evaluation under initial and degraded conditions, the impact on a power module's operating temperature was correlated to an estimation of the device's reliability...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} is made between two different cooling schemes, including a complete system thermal analysis and weight accounting for each. A hydrogen-direct system operates {{at a higher}} pressure (34. 5 Mpa) and greater temperature rise in the coolant. There is no temperature limit on the coolant itself and high injector temperatures may be achieved, but the pressure lines must be routed over great distances (10 m). The system is simple, and the coolant is almost weightless. In contrast, an indirect system operates at a lower pressure (3. 8 n MPa) and the liquid coolant has a much greater thermal capacity. The greater thermal capacity causes much less of a temperature rise in the coolant. The chosen coolant is Syltherm 800. This nontoxic fluid is compatible with any metal, including titanium. The loop requires a separate fuel/coolant heat exchanger and coolant pump. The indirect system offers some distinct safety advantages but is heavier than the <b>direct</b> hydrogen <b>coolant</b> system...|$|R
40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{heat conduction}} {{problem in a}} porous wall with a cooling fluid was considered theoretically. The case related to the porous injector head of rocket engine, where the heat flux is <b>directed</b> toward a <b>coolant</b> flow, was studied. The equations for the temperatures of permeable media and coolant were solved analytically. Using reasonable assumptions the equation system was simplified and the order of equations as reduced. The margins, where the used assumptions are valid, were defined. The solution is expressed in hyperbolic functions and shows that the flow of coolant leads {{to the increase in}} the temperature gradient near the hot side of porous wall. The expressions for the temperatures of wall and coolant at hot-gas-side wall are given. The thickness of wall, at which the temperature of the hot wall is independent on the wall thickness, was found...|$|R

Each module 50 A houses a first phase change material 55 A, for example hexadecane paraffin, and each module 50 B houses a second phase change material 55 B, for example tetradecane paraffin, which has a phase change temperature which is less than the phase change temperature of the first phase change material 55 A. The cooling apparatus 20 is equipped with a coolant heat exchange circuit provided with mode selection valves 84 and 86 which are operated by a controller 88 to selectively <b>direct</b> the LCG <b>coolant</b> to be cooled through the cooling apparatus in one of three operating modes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{comparisons of}} utilizing direct oil cooling approaches and conventional indirect cooling approaches for electrical motors which are mounted in HEVs or ZEVs. Both finite volume Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model by FLUENT and finite element electromagnetic model by JMAG {{are applied to}} make the simulation accurate and comprehensive. Average temperature over the stator back, pressure drop between inlet and outlet and average heat transfer coefficient over the cooling duct are evaluated under identical flow rate, velocity and pressure drop for different cooling approaches. In addition, the influences on torque and power performances by the cooling ducts made in the housing or stator back are evaluated by JMAG model. The directly cooled motors show lower temperature rises at the stator back since the <b>direct</b> contact between <b>coolant</b> and stator back can avoid the unnecessary thermal contact resistances between the stator back and housing, meanwhile make the coolant more close to the heat sources, and thus improve the cooling efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Titanium is {{classified}} as a difficult to machine superalloy. Its low thermal conductivity causes a concentration of heat in the tool. It causes cutting tools to overheat during machining, that leads to increased machining cost. However, recent advances in cooling technology in aerospace manufacturing, specifically the combination of through spindle cooling and split tools, is claimed to yield improved Ti- 6 AL- 4 V machining productivity. The development was led by a tool supplier placing a premium on confidentiality. The result is as this technology has only recently been released into the market, rather little if any performance studies {{have been published in}} scientific literature. The paper investigates the potential machining benefits of through spindle cooled split tools for Ti- 6 AL- 4 V milling. The geometry, coolant flow and operational characteristics of the split tools are described. The performance of other more conventional cooling methods such as a nozzle <b>directed</b> high pressure <b>coolant</b> stream is presented from literature. The investigation includes test results of split tools. In conclusion an application domain is discussed where the technology offers improvements over existing technologies...|$|R
40|$|Mass {{and energy}} {{transfer}} between confined plasma and coolant gas streams was studied experimentally. Argon {{was used as}} the plasma gas and nitrogen {{was used as the}} coolant gas. The temperature profiles present in the mixing region were determined by optical-spectrographic methods. Both the electronic excitation temperature of the argon atoms and the rotational temperatures of the nitrogen molecules were determined. The compositions and axial velocities present in the plasma coolant mixing region were determined by sampling probe methods. The measured nitrogen temperatures were found to be much lower than the argon temperatures present at the same point in the flow. The difference could be explained on the basis of incomplete mixing and thermal equilibration on the microscopic scale. The composition profiles indicated that <b>direct</b> induction of <b>coolant</b> into the high-velocity plasma jet and the formation of a recirculation eddy increased the mixing of plasma and coolant. From the standpoint of carrying out a chemical reaction in the plasma jet, the results indicate that the mixing of a reactant injected into a plasma jet reaction chamber with the plasma would be very rapid but that the internal energy modes of the reactant molecule might not be fully excited during the short residence time in the high-velocity flow...|$|R
40|$|Cable-in-Conduit Conductors (CICCs) {{are used}} in the {{fabrication}} of superconducting fusion grade magnets. It acts as a narrow cryostat to provide cryo-stability with <b>direct</b> contact of <b>coolant</b> fluid to conductor. The superconducting magnets are cooled using forced flow (FF), supercritical helium or two phase (TP) cooling through void space in the CICC. Thermo-hydraulics using supercritical helium single phase flow is well-known and established. Research topic of behavior of forced flow, two phase (TP) helium cooling in CICC involves perceived risks of the CICC running into flow chocking and possible thermo-acoustic oscillations leading to flow instabilities. This research work involves study of forced flow two phase helium cooling in CICC wound superconducting magnets. The TP flow provides cryo-stability by the latent heat of helium not by enthalpy as in case of CICC being cooled with supercritical helium. Study reveals some attractive regimes in the case of TP cooling, at a given mass flow rate of single phase helium at the inlet and a heat flux acting on the CICC. Analysis carried out predicts significant gains with TP cooling on a prototype CICC, which is circular in cross section and appropriate for fusion devices for high magnetic field applications. These general formalisms may be extended to specific magnets wound with CICC. This paper describes analysis of TP cooling of a CICC...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{characteristics}} of Canadian Supercritical Water-cooled Reactor (SCWR) are {{significantly different from}} those of CANDU reactors due to the supercritical water coolant and the once-through <b>direct</b> cycle <b>coolant</b> system. Therefore, it is necessary to study its dynamic behaviour and further design adequate control system. An accurate dynamic model is needed to describe the dynamic behaviour. Moving boundary method is applied to improve numerical accuracy and stability. In the model construction process, three regions have been considered depending on bulk and wall temperature being higher or lower than the pseudo-critical temperature. Benefits of adopting moving boundary method are illustrated in comparison with the fixed boundary method. The model is validated with both steady-state and transient simulation and can accurately predict the dynamic behaviour of the Canadian SCWR. A linear dynamic model, for dynamic analysis and control system design, is obtained through linearization on the nonlinear dynamic models derived from conservation equations. The linearized dynamic models are validated against the full order nonlinear models in both time domain and frequency domain. The open-loop dynamics are also investigated through extensive simulations. Cross-coupling analysis among inputs and outputs is examined using Relative Gain Array (RGA) and Nyquist plots, from which adequate input-output pairings are identified. Cross-coupling at different operating conditions are also evaluated to illustrate the nonlinearities. It can be concluded that the Canadian SCWR is a Multiple Input and Multiple Output (MIMO) system with strong cross-coupling and a high degree of nonlinearity. Due to the existence of strong cross-coupling, the Direct Nyquist Array (DNA) method is used to decouple the system into a diagonal dominance form via a pre-compensator. Three Single Input and Single Output (SISO) compensators are synthesized to the pre-compensated system in the frequency domain. The temperature variation induced by the disturbances at the reactor power and pressure can be significantly reduced. To deal with the nonlinearities, a gain scheduling control strategy is adopted. Different set of controllers are used at different load conditions. The control strategy is evaluated under various operating scenarios. It is shown that gain scheduling control can successfully achieve satisfactory performance for different operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|The key {{objectives}} in introducing passive features in thesafety systems for Light Water Reactor (LWR) are to increasetheir reliability, {{to simplify the}} design of the plants and toimprove performance and economics. Component and integralsystem tests in scaled facilities are required for optimizingthe design and for certification of these safety systems. Experimental programs are also needed for a betterunderstanding of all significant physical phenomena on thebasis of which the passive safety systems function. In thefirst partof the thesis the results of an investigationon melt coolability with bottom coolant injection arepresented. Ex-vessel coolability of a molten pool and/or debrisis, perhaps the most vexing remaining issue, needingresolution, in the beyond the design-base safety assessment forthe current and the future light water reactor plants. Latephase of the progression of a severe accident is associatedwith corium-melt discharge from the Reactor Pressure Vessel(RPV) and its relocation on the concrete basemat in the form ofa debris bed consisting of liquid/particulate corium. The coredebris generates decay heat and attacks the concrete basematand the containment structures and continues to do so, untilthe coolability of debris bed is achieved. Failure to assurethe coolability of the debris bed is tantamount to the failureto assure the termination of the severe accident. A researchprogram named DECOBI was developed at the Nuclear Power Safetydivision of the Royal Institute of Technology to study thecoolability of melt pools with bottom coolant injection whichoccurs passively through nozzles embeddedin concrete whichopen after ablation of a predetermined depth of concretebasemat. The research objective was to explore the mechanism ofhigh heat transfer and in particular the large scale porosityformation. In the DECOBI program first a series of experimentswere performed at low temperature, by using transparent pooland coolant that allows the visualization of the flow patternduring the pool-coolant interaction. The parameters governingthe early stages of the coolant phase change and dispersion inthe pool are identified through these visual experiments. Experiments were performed also with metallic (Pb) andbinary oxide simulants (CaO-B 2 O 3, MnO-TiO 2, CaO-WO 3), such that a substantial range of parametersinfluencing coolant-melt interaction and the subsequent debrisstructure was investigated. The molten metal (Pb) has highconductivity and low viscosity, which results in a high heattransfer rate and mixing of pool and coolant. The coolingprocess occurs rapidly and the porosity, after solidificationhas a fine and quite uniform structure. On the contrary theoxide mixture CaO-B 2 O 3 has high temperature, low conductivity, highviscosity and glassy material structure, which resulted inlower heat transfer rate and more difficult pool-coolantmixing. In the coolant-contacted regions, directly above thenozzle locations, an interconnected branched channel typeporosity was obtained. These regions had high porosity and theyquenched due to the continuous passage of coolant, even longafter solidification. The other regions did not developporosity because the crust formed outside the quenched regions,prevented the <b>direct</b> contact of <b>coolant</b> with these regions. These regions, however, could conduct heat to the adjacent coldregions and cooled eventually. The experiments performed usingtheoxide mixtures CaO-WO 3 and MnO-TiO 2 (which have lower viscosity compared to that ofCaO-B 2 O 3 and a ceramic material structure) showed betterpool-coolant mixing and rapid quenching of the melt. Theporosity obtained was uniformly distributed throughout themelt. DECOBI program, thus, reveals that, through this schemeof coolant injection the debris arriving in the containment asa result of vessel failure can be quenched in a relativelyshort time. Analysis performed, based on the insights gainedfrom the experiments, estimates the amount of porosity that canbe obtained with a single nozzle. Thesecond partof the thesis is focused on the issue of thelight gas effects on the efficiency of a Passive ContainmentCooling System (PCCS) for a Boiling Water Reactor. The presenceof hydrogen affects the efficiency of PCCS, sincenon-condensable gases reduce the steam condensation rate andconsequently the efficiency of the condensers. The gasdistribution not only influences the PCC performance but alsoaffects the containment pressure build-up. The data and someanalysis of a series of four system transient tests performedin the PANDA facility, show that retention of non-condensablegas in the DW could mitigate the system pressure. The PCC(Passive Cooling Condenser) operation modes are qualitativelydiscussed and the PCCS performance is analyzed for one test byquantifying the major heat sinks (PCC pools, wetwell pool, RPVwater, structural materials, etc) and comparing them during thetest period with the decay heat (heat source) generated in theRPV. The heat transfer coefficients in one PCC have beendetermined for one test at selected times before, during andafter helium injection. In this way, the effect of light gashas been quantified in term of variation of heat transferrate. Keywords:DECOBI, nuclear severe accident, PANDA,PCCS...|$|R
