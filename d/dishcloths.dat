Brooms and <b>dishcloths</b> never could be as distasteful as they once had been, for Beth had presided over both, and something of her housewifely spirit seemed to linger around the little mop and the old brush, never thrown away. As she used them, Jo found herself humming the songs Beth used to hum, imitating Beth's orderly ways, and giving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and cozy, which was the first step toward making home happy, though she didn't know it till Hannah said with an approving squeeze of the hand...|$|E

Brooke came home'. I also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a supply of dusters, holders, and piece bags, for Beth made enough to last till the silver wedding came round, and invented three different kinds of <b>dishcloths</b> for the express service of the bridal china.|$|E

50|$|The work on {{uncovering}} {{the secrets of}} what people believe in relation to food safety continues, with Ackerley's work for the UK Hygiene Council’s survey of home hygiene. Last year’s study revealed that 75% of <b>dishcloths</b> were extremely dirty - indicating that when people think they are cleaning, they are actually “dirtying”. Chris Evans on BBC Radio 2 interviewed Ackerley in February 2009 on this very subject, {{as he was concerned}} about why his <b>dishcloths</b> smelled so bad.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dishcloths</b> {{are often}} left damp {{and provide a}} {{breeding}} ground for bacteria. Since the kitchen sink is used to clean food, <b>dishcloths</b> are routinely infected with E. coli and salmonella. In 2007 a study from the Journal of Environmental Health found that putting a damp dishcloth (or sponge) in the microwave for 2 minutes killed 99% of living pathogens. However, fire departments have subsequently warned people not to do this as it can be a fire hazard, especially if the dishcloth or sponge is not sufficiently wet. Several small fires have been started as a result of people following the advice from the study.|$|E

50|$|Prevention of mold {{exposure}} {{from food}} is generally to consume food {{that has no}} mold growths on it. Also, mold growth {{in the first place}} can be prevented by the same concept of mold growth, assessment, and remediation that prevents air exposure.

50|$|Traditionally, {{cross-stitch}} {{was used}} to embellish items like household linens, tablecloths, <b>dishcloths,</b> and doilies (only {{a small portion of}} which would actually be embroidered, such as a border). Although there are many cross-stitchers who still employ it in this fashion, it is now increasingly popular to work the pattern on pieces of fabric and hang them on the wall for decoration. Cross stitch is also often used to make greeting cards, pillowtops, or as inserts for box tops, coasters and trivets.|$|E
40|$|The {{microbiology}} {{of domestic}} kitchens {{in the homes}} of subjects who had suffered sporadic Salmonella infection (cases) was compared with control domestic kitchens. Case and control <b>dishcloths</b> and refrigerator swabs were examined for the presence of Salmonella spp., total Enterobacteriaceae counts and total aerobic colony counts. Salmonella spp. were isolated from both case and control <b>dishcloths</b> and refrigerators but {{there were no significant differences}} between the two groups. Colony counts were similar in case and control <b>dishcloths</b> and refrigerator swabs. There was no relationship between the total counts and presence of Salmonella. There was no evidence that cases of Salmonella infection were more likely to have kitchens which were contaminated with these bacteria or have higher bacterial counts than controls. Total bacterial counts were poor indicators of Salmonella contamination of the domestic kitchen environment. Further factors which could not be identified by a study of this design may increase risk of Salmonella food poisoning. These factors may include individual susceptibility of the patient. Alternatively, sporadic cases of Salmonella food poisoning may arise from food prepared outside the home...|$|E

40|$|The {{first study}} was {{designed}} to determine the occurrence of bacteria in <b>dishcloths</b> used in restaurants and bars. Coliforms were isolated from 89 % of <b>dishcloths</b> and 70 % of tabletops. Escherichia coli was isolated from 54 % of <b>dishcloths</b> and 20 % of tabletops. The numbers of heterotrophic bacteria (HPC) and coliforms were higher in bars than in restaurants. The levels of HPC found in <b>dishcloths</b> were 25 -fold and coliforms were 60 -to 120 -fold lower than the levels found in <b>dishcloths</b> in previous home studies. The most commonly isolated genera from <b>dishcloths</b> in restaurants and bars differed from those in homes. The numbers of HPC on restaurant tabletops were 45 -fold greater after cleaning than prior to cleaning. The mandatory use of sanitizers in restaurants and bars may therefore have reduced contamination levels and caused a shift in the microbial populations present in food service establishments. The second {{study was designed}} to determine the recovery efficiency and the survival of two respiratory viruses on produce and was compared to the survival of the enteric poliovirus 1. Adenovirus was recovered with an efficiency of 56 %, 32 % and 35 % from lettuce, strawberries and raspberries, respectively. Coronavirus was recovered from lettuce with an efficiency of 19. 6 %, but could not be recovered from strawberries. Poliovirus was recovered from lettuce with an efficiency of 76. 6 % and 0. 06 % from strawberries. The survival of the viruses was observed for up to eight days. Adenovirus survived the longest on raspberries, with a log₁₀ reduction of 0. 61, followed by 1. 68 - and 1. 75 -log₁₀ reductions on strawberries and lettuce, respectively. Coronavirus declined by 0. 41 -log₁₀ after two days and > 1. 34 log₁₀ by day 4 on lettuce. The enteric poliovirus 1 survived longer on produce, decreasing by only 0. 37 -log₁₀ on lettuce and 1. 30 -log₁₀ on strawberries. A microbial risk assessment was performed to assess the risk of infection from ingesting 1, 10, and 100 particles of adenovirus on lettuce. The estimated risk of infection by ingesting these numbers were 1 : 2000, 1 : 200, and 1 : 20, respectively and increased in a proportional way as the number of servings was increased from one to ten and 365 servings of lettuce...|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} of a series of {{articles}} about statistics for biologists, Anthony Hilton and Richard Armstrong talk about the distribution of data — are they normal? Is the data normal? Chi Squared and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test The first stage of any statistical analysis is to determine the degree to which, if at all, the data depart from normality. Having established the distribution of the data, parametric or non-parametric statistical tests may be applied as appropriate. Microbiological data, especially from environmental sources, may have very large counts and associated standard deviations, and are unlikely to be normally distributed. In this StatNote we describe the application of two tests of normality. The Scenario The domestic kitchen is increasingly recognised as an important reservoir of pathogenic microorganisms, with <b>dishcloths</b> and sponges providing an ideal environment for their growth, survival and dissemination. Given the intrinsic structural and compositional differences between these two material types, a study was envisaged to investigate if one provided a more favourable environment for bacterial survival than the other; the hypothesis being that there would be a quantitative difference between the number of microorganisms recovered from <b>dishcloths</b> compared to sponges.

40|$|Head to Head’ was a two-person {{exhibition}} at Castlefield Gallery in Manchester, including works by Hayley Newman and Emily Speed. Newman exhibited three new works in ‘Head to Head’. ‘Domestique’ (2010 - 13) {{was a series}} of over seventy <b>dishcloths</b> embroidered with faces (thirty-eight were exhibited). The second body of work in the exhibition was ‘Façadism’ (2013 -present), short stories about faces and building façades, presented as a group of A 1 posters, pasted directly onto the gallery walls. ‘Façadism’ takes its title from architectural terminology describing the practice of demolishing a building while maintaining its façade. Designed by the Fraser Muggeridge Studio, the stories were mocked up to resemble photocopies of an old book. Pages were unnumbered and the writing is ongoing. The final work in this grouping {{was a series of}} frottage renderings of the fronts of banks, entitled ‘Histoire Economique’ (2013), a reference to Max Ernst’s ‘Histoire Naturelle’ (1926).

40|$|Four {{language}} production experiments {{examine how}} English speakers plan compound words during phonological encoding. The experiments tested production latencies in both delayed and online tasks for English noun-noun compounds (e. g., daytime), adjective-noun phrases (e. g., dark time), and monomorphemic words (e. g., denim). In delayed production, speech onset latencies reflect {{the total number}} of prosodic units in the target sentence. In online production, speech latencies reflect the size of the first prosodic unit. Compounds are metrically similar to adjective-noun phrases as they contain two lexical and two prosodic words. However, in Experiments 1 and 2, native English speakers treated the compounds as single prosodic units, indistinguishable from simple words, with RT data statistically different than that of the adjective-noun phrases. Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrate that compounds are also treated as single prosodic units in utterances containing clitics (e. g., <b>dishcloths</b> are clean) as they incorporate the verb into a single phonological word (i. e. dishcloths-are). Taken together, these results suggest that English compounds are planned as single recursive prosodic units. Our data require an adaptation of the classic model of phonological encoding to incorporate a distinction between lexical and postlexical prosodic processes, such that lexical boundaries have consequences for post-lexical phonological encoding. </p...|$|E
