Two angular variables were measured. Firstly, the angle between the long axis of the third molar and the occlusal plane (M 3 –OP) and secondly, the angle between the long axis of the third molar and the long axis of the second molar (M 3 –M 2). Data were analyzed by paired and student’s t-test. ResultThe analyzed data to assess {{the changes in the}} third molar angulation from pretreatment to post treatment did not vary significantly in both the groups (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Magister Scientiae Dentium - MSc(Dent) The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether there are changes in the interdental arch widths and arch lengths of the mandibular and maxillary arches during nonextraction and extraction orthodontic treatment. The records of 78 patients treated by one orthodontist were used for this study. Three treatment groups were selected: a nonextraction group (Group NE), a <b>group</b> treated with <b>extraction</b> of maxillary and mandibular first premolars (Group 44), and a <b>group</b> treated with <b>extraction</b> of maxillary first premolars and mandibular second premolars (Group 45). The arch width measurements were measured in the inter-canine, inter-premolar and inter-molar areas. The arch length was measured as the sum of the left and right distances from mesial anatomic contact points of the first permanent molars to the contact point of the central incisors or to the midpoint between the central incisor contacts, if spaced. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics of the data, analysis of the correlation matrices, Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests of the changes which occurred during treatment. The intercanine widths in the mandible and maxilla increased during treatment in all three <b>groups,</b> with the <b>extraction</b> <b>groups</b> showing a greater increase than Group NE (p 0. 05), while the maxillary arch length remained essentially unchanged. Both <b>extraction</b> <b>groups</b> showed decreases in arch length in the dentitions (p< 0. 05), with greater decreases occurring in the maxilla. The difference in arch length change between the two <b>extraction</b> <b>groups</b> was not significant (p< 0. 05). The inter-canine arch width increased in all three treatment groups, more so in the two <b>extraction</b> <b>groups.</b> From this it is evident that extraction treatment does not necessarily lead to narrowing of the dental arches in the canine region.

Design: Prospective case series. Setting: Horus Vision Correction Center and Ellite Vision Correction Center, Alexandria, Egypt. Methods: Myopic eyes with astigmatism up to 4. 00 diopters (D) had wavefront-guided LASIK or small-incision lenticule extraction. Visual and refractive changes were evaluated during a 6 -month follow-up. The astigmatic changes were evaluated using the Alpins method. Result: The study evaluated 107 eyes (55 patients), 52 eyes having wavefront-guided LASIK and 55 eyes, small-incision lenticule extraction. No statistically significant differences were found in the 6 -month postoperative sphere between the 2 groups (P =. 652). The postoperative manifest cylinder and spherical equivalent were significantly lower in the wavefront-guided LASIK group (P <. 001). The 6 -month postoperative cylinder was 0. 50 D or less in all eyes in the wavefront-guided LASIK groups and in 79. 8 % in the small-incision lenticule <b>extraction</b> <b>group</b> (P <. 001).

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparative study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi {{during the period}} 2003 to 2005. METHODOLOGY: Data were collected using records of patients who visited the study setting during the study period. Pre- and post-treatment lateral cephalographs and study casts of 81 orthodontic patients (41 =non-extraction and 40 =premolar extractions) were taken. Variables used for evaluating vertical dimension were Frankfort mandibular plane angle (FMA), facial height (N-Me), facial height ratio (N-ANS/ANS-Me), soft tissue facial height (G 2 ̆ 7 to Me 2 ̆ 7), soft tissue facial height ratio (G 2 ̆ 7 -Sn 2 ̆ 7 /zn 2 ̆ 7 -Me 2 ̆ 7), upper first molar to palatal plane and lower first molar to mandibular plane distance, posterior facial height to anterior facial height ratio (PFH/AFH) and Y-axis. Intercanine, interpremolar and intermolar widths and arch depths were also measured. To evaluate the pre-treatment and posttreatment comparison within each group, paired t-tests were used. For pre- and posttreatment comparisons between the extraction and non-extraction groups, independent sample t-tests were used.

30|$|In {{regard to}} the gonial angle, a similar {{observation}} of a decrease but at a higher value (−[*] 2.5, SD 4.5) was made by Kirschneck et al. [14] in an <b>extraction</b> <b>group</b> of patients. Other authors could not confirm any similar findings [8], while most did not assess changes in the gonial angle. Gonial angle though is an important parameter of the craniofacial complex giving an indication about the vertical parameters and symmetry of the facial skeleton. Any change in the gonial angle might be attributed to two distinctive causes. Either there is a true morphologic change in the angle between the ramus and {{the base of the}} mandible or there is a change in the location of the derived cephalometric landmark of articulare due to rotation of the mandible. Because of the curvature in the mandibular condyle, any minute change in the identification of articulare can {{have an impact on the}} gonial angle. Even though not statistically significant, most changes for vertical parameters were negative in the <b>extraction</b> <b>group,</b> thus showing a vertical decrease, which could lead to the alteration of the gonial angle.|$|E
30|$|The {{borderline}} {{group of}} patients identified by the discriminant analysis exhibited similar morphological characteristics at treatment’s onset; therefore, the posttreatment changes could safely {{be attributed to the}} choice of extraction or non-extraction treatment and not to pre-existing differences. Treatment choice {{had an impact on the}} patients’ vertical skeletal dimensions. Patients treated with four first premolar extractions showed a slight decrease in the vertical skeletal measurements, whereas non-extraction patient treatment showed a slight increase. The treatment time was also significantly higher in the <b>extraction</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E
30|$|The sample {{consisted}} of 542 randomly selected records of Class I patients treated in a university graduate program and in five private orthodontic offices. Of these patients, 331 were female and 211 male. The mean age was 14.55 (standard deviation (SD) 5.36) for the non-extraction group and 14.52 (SD 4.86) for the <b>extraction</b> <b>group.</b> The extensive series of 32 linear and angular measurements derived from the cephalometric analysis and the dental casts, along with the variables of age and gender, fueled a stepwise discriminant analysis.|$|E
40|$|The {{architecture}} of a distributed vision system is presented, with particular attention {{directed to the}} bottom-up indexing mechanism performed by a hierarchically organized network of information processing (IP) modules. Each IP module adaptively transforms input data passed by lower-level modules into more complete observations and performs a transformation that is modeled as a regularization process. This scheme {{is applied to the}} problem of recognizing objects whose 3 -D shape can be described as a set of planar surfaces. Edge detection, straight-line <b>extraction,</b> <b>grouping,</b> and matching are the IP modules considered. In particular, the regularization process consists of either a voting scheme or a Markov random field labeling process, depending on the level. At the higher level, a degree of belief is given about the presence of objects contained in the scene and considered in the model database. Results demonstrate both the validity of the processes applied separately at each level and the global consistency of the method...|$|R
40|$|The <b>extraction</b> of <b>group</b> A streptococcal antigens {{by group}} C phage-associated lysin has been confirmed. In {{addition}} to the T antigen the extract contained M-protein, group-specific polysaccharide and mucopeptide antigen which was difficult to remove. This method of extraction of the T antigen was compared with the trypsin method. The latter method {{was found to be}} of advantage in giving a pure specific antigen...|$|R
30|$|In this section, {{algorithms}} for photo analysis {{have been}} organized in three categories: assessment, information <b>extraction,</b> and <b>grouping.</b> From the performed review, assessment {{seems to be}} the less explored area. This may be explained by the highly subjective nature of the task, which makes it difficult to perform precise or universal analyses. The other two areas are more explored in the literature and present a richer set of approaches.|$|R
