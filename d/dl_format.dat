Pyrgg {{has the ability}} to generate graphs of different sizes and is designed to provide input files for broad range of graph-based research applications, including but not limited to testing, benchmarking and performance-analysis of graph processing frameworks. Pyrgg target audiences are computer scientists who study graph algorithms and graph processing frameworks.

Shortly after, Datalogics {{was acquired by}} Frame Technology and in 1995 Frame Technology (and Datalogics) was acquired by Adobe. In 1996 Adobe Ventures invested in Datalogics, a reincorporation under its original name as a privately held, independent entity.|$|R

There are also equivalent European Computer Manufacturers Association (Ecma) standards {{for some of these}} specifications, such as Ecma-267 for DVD-ROMs. Also, the DVD+RW Alliance publishes competing recordable DVD specifications such as DVD+R, DVD+R DL, DVD+RW or DVD+RW <b>DL.</b> These DVD <b>formats</b> are also ISO standards.|$|R
5000|$|In 1946, Decca Records {{released}} {{an album of}} the score for Fancy Free (Decca DA-406), conducted by [...] Leonard Bernstein [...] Before {{the introduction of the}} LP, this was initially released in the original 78rpm album format, in which four 78rpm records were bound together in a photo album style book, with a booklet included. Each of the seven movements of the ballet, plus the introductory vocal number Big Stuff, comprised one side of a 78. The sides were sequenced with the last number backing the first, the second-last the second, and so on, so that all four discs could be stacked and played in sequence, then flipped en masse to complete the album. The album was rereleased in 1953 in the new 10" [...] LP <b>format</b> (<b>DL</b> 6023).|$|R
40|$|A {{flexible}} {{information model}} for systematic development and deployment of product families during {{all phases of}} the product realization process is crucial for product-oriented organizations. In this {{paper we propose a}} unified information model to capture, share, and organize product design contents, concepts, and contexts across different phases of the product realization process using a web ontology language (OWL) representation. Representing product families by preconceived common ontologies shows promise in promoting component sharing while facilitating search and exploration of design information over various phases and spanning multiple products in a family. Three distinct types of design information, namely, (1) customer needs, (2) product functions, and (3) product components captured during different phases of the product realization process, are considered in this paper to demonstrate the proposed information model. Product vector and function component mapping matrices along with the common ontologies are utilized for designer-initiated information exploration and aggregation. As a demonstration, six products from a family of power tools are represented in OWL <b>DL</b> (Description Logic) <b>format,</b> capturing distinct information needed during the various phases of product realization...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedEarning {{a college degree}} is an aspiration of many, and on-line distance learning (DL) is a feasible way to attain that level of education. The Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) offers masters- and doctorate-level degrees to federal government employees via resident and DL means. Does either method of delivery provide a better, or worse, opportunity for strong student performance? Do available student characteristics lead to better performance in one method or the other? This study analyzed the performance of 2, 633 student Navy officers in the NPS Graduate School of Business and Public Policy (GSBPP), the Graduate School of Engineering and Applied Science (GSEAS) and the Graduate School of Operational and Information Science (GSOIS) in the <b>DL</b> and resident <b>formats.</b> The analysis used simple linear models, general linear models, and recursive partitioning to determine which of ten-selected predictors can identify strong or poor student performance. Results of the analysis showed the NPS Academic Profile Code (APC) is a strong indicator of an increased probability of success, while DL students in GSEAS and GSOIS are at greatest risk of poor performance. More research is recommended to determine why those students have difficulty succeeding at NPS. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
