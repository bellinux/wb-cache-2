Bio-inspired bi-layered physical hydrogels only constituted of chitosan and water were processed and applied to the treatment of full-thickness burn injuries. The aim of the study was at assessing whether this material was totally accepted by the host organism and allowed in vivo skin reconstruction of limited area third-degree burns. A first layer constituted of a rigid protective <b>gel</b> <b>ensured</b> good mechanical properties and gas exchanges.

40|$|Introduction: At present, {{the polymer}} gel {{dosimeter}} {{is considered to}} be the best possible dosimeter for measuring 3 -dimesional radiation dose distribution in radiotherapy. These gels are normally toxic; therefore, manufacturing, handling and discarding them require special attention. In order to find less toxic recipe, N-isopropyle acrylamide polymer gel (NIPAM) was introduced. In this study, the reproducibility and stability of NIPAM polymer gel dose response together with some influencing factors related to MR imaging were studied. Methods: The NIPAM gel was prepared according to a method, described by senden et al in 2006. The gels were irradiated approximately 2 h after manufacturing and MR images of the gel were made 24 h after irradiation. The effects of different batches, post-irradiation time and the MRI room temperature on reproducibility and stability of polymer gel dose response were explored by analyzing the NMR response (R 2) of the gel. Results: In a fixed temperature, the response of the gel was found to be stable 24 h after irradiation. The results showed that the dose response of the NIPAM polymer gel is highly reproducible in the same and different batches of chemical. No inhomogeneity was observed for magnetic fields in the specified position of measurements and 5 °C fluctuation was recorded for MRI room temperature. Conclusion: Fluctuation in MRI room temperature necessitates that stringent attention to be paid to controlling the gel temperature at the time of imaging. The new formulation of polymer <b>gel</b> <b>ensures</b> stability of the gels’ spatial resolution and makes it a suitable dosimeter for distant or remote measurements...|$|R

Polyethylene glycol based graphene gels have been synthesized and very high ER response, 25, 000 percent enhancement in viscosity under influence of electric field, has been observed for low concentration systems 2 wt. percent. The gels overcome several drawbacks innate to ER fluids.

In the present study, we tested two different 3 -D culture systems and apply them to the epigenetic conversion of mouse dermal fibroblasts into insulin producing-cells (Pennarossa, et al., 2013; Brevini, et al., 2015), combining also the use of two oxygen tensions. In particular, cells were differentiated using the Polytetrafluoroethylene micro-bioreactor (PTFE) and the Polyacrylamide (PAA) gels with different stiffness (1 kPa; 4 kPa), maintained either in the standard 20 % or in the more physiological 5 % oxygen tensions. Standard differentiation performed on plastic substrates was assessed as a control. Cell morphology (Fig. 1 A), insulin expression and release were analyzed to evaluate the role of both stiffness and oxygen tension in the process. The results obtained showed that 1 kPa PAA gel and PTFE system induced a significantly higher insulin expression and release than plastic and 4 kPa PAA gel, especially in low oxygen condition (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, comparing {{the efficiency of the}} two systems tested, 1 kPa PAA <b>gel</b> <b>ensured</b> a higher insulin transcription than PTFE (Fig. 1 C).

40|$|The Vif (viral {{infectivity}} factor) protein of HIV- 1 enhances viral infectivity during virus production 100 to 1000 fold (4). Though Vif {{is required}} for HIV- 1 infection in peripheral blood T lymphocytes, macrophages, and some T cell lines, its exact role during HIV- 1 infection remains unknown (13). Currently, it is proposed that Vif may affect the late phases of the viral life cycle, such as virion assembly and maturation (4). In {{order to get a}} better understanding of the function and mechanism of Vif, obtaining the structure of the protein is of extreme importance. Unfortunately, no structural information is available. Determining the structure of a protein using NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy requires that the protein be monomeric in solution. However, Vif exists in solution as aggregates, making NMR impossible. Constructing deletion mutants of Vif may change the protein’s aggregation behavior to monomeric in solution. Thus, these mutants may be the key to determining the structure of Vif, which, in turn, may lead to a better understanding of its function and indicate possible HIV- 1 drug targets. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was used to make the Vif deletion mutants. Restriction digests were performed on both the vector (pDlOVif) and the PCR product using the enzymes BamHl and Hindlll.

Because of the versatility of the technique, {{a wide range of}} protocols for the separation of samples like rare metal ions, protein isoforms, multiprotein complexes, peptides, organelles, cells, DNA origami, blood serum and nanoparticles exist. The advantage of FFE is the fast and gentle separation of samples dissolved in a liquid solvent without any need of a matrix, like polyacrylamide in <b>gel</b> electrophoresis. This <b>ensures</b> a very high recovery rate since analytes do not adhere to any carrier or matrix structure.

The adsorption of water vapours by dried pAAm cryogels was marginally dependent on the degree of grafting. The swelling of AAc-grafted pAAm cryogel increased pronouncedly with increasing pH. The adsorption of low-molecular weight ligand, Cu(II), by AAc-grafted pAAm cryogels increased linearly with the degree of grafting, while binding of high-molecular weight ligand, lysozyme, increased linearly till the degree of grafting of about 40 % followed by a sharp, nearly three-fold increase in lysozyme binding when the degree of grafting increased from 60 to 70 %.

40|$|Geopolymer {{can be used}} {{to produce}} {{structural}} concrete without the consideration on the emission of carbon dioxide as what Portland cement did. Geopolymer are produced when alumino-silicate, like fly ash mixed with a strong alkaline solution. The production of geopolymer is more economical and sustainable than normal cement. Durability of a structure is one of the concern for the engineers. In order to maintain the strength characteristic of the geopolymer, way to prolong the lifespan and cater the durability problems caused by cracks after high temperature exposure. Presence of self-healing agent contributes to the enhancement on the strength characteristic of the geopolymer concrete after high temperature exposure. There are several type of self-healing agent which can be used in geopolymer, such as: Poly Methyl Acrylate, silica gel, tung oil,silicone and bacterial solution. Silica gel will be used for this research as a self-healing agent. The main objective of this research is to determine the strength performance of self-healing geopolymer mortar after high temperature exposure. This research is conducted along with the following sub-objectives which is to identify the suitability of silica gel as self-healing agent in geopolymer mortar after exposed to extremely high temperature and the effectiveness of silica gel as self-healing agent in geopolymer mortar. Samples were subjected to elevated temperature of 500, 600 and 700 °C. The highest compressive strength achieved with the inclusion of silica gel in the specimen was 63. 579 MPa which is higher than normal concrete. The compressive strength of the geopolymer mortar is also preserved after high temperature exposure. The performance of the geopolymer concrete is enhanced with the presence of the self-healing agent as the micro cracks are filled. The compressive strength of geopolymer was preserved even after exposure to 500 °C in the furnace for 30 minutes. Samples showed that the compressive strength decreased exponentially from 600 °C onwards which indicated geopolymer started to fail structurally. At 500 °C, the compressive strength did not have significant difference where there are only slight reduction in the specimens. As a conclusion, the objectives of this research have been fulfilled. Silica gel is suitable for the self-healing mechanism to take place.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of an ongoing project financed by the Campania Region, a prototype system for seismic early and post-event warning is being developed and tested, based on a dense, wide dynamic seismic network (ISNet) and under installation in the Apennine belt region. This paper reports {{the characteristics of the}} seismic network, focussing on the required technological innovation of the different seismic network components (data-logger, sensors and data communication). To ensure a highly dynamic recording range, each station is equipped with two types of sensors: a strong-motion accelerometer and a velocimeter. Data acquisition at the seismic stations is performed using Osiris- 6 model data-loggers made by Agecodagis. Each station is supplied with two (120 W) solar panels and two 130 Ah <b>gel</b> cell batteries, <b>ensuring</b> 72 -h autonomy for the seismic and radio communication equipment. The site is also equipped with a GSM/GPRS programmable control/alarm system connected to several environmental sensors (door forcing, solar panel controller, battery, fire, etc) and through which the site status is known in real time. The data are stored locally on the hard-disk and, at the same time, continuously transmitted by the SeedLink protocol to local acquisition/analysis nodes (Local Control Center) via Wireless LAN bridge. At each LCC site runs a linux Earthworm system which stores and manages the acquired data stream. The real-time analysis system will perform event detection and localization based on triggers coming from data-loggers and parametric information coming from the other LCCs. Once an event is detected, the system will performs automatic magnitude and focal mechanism estimations. In the immediate post-event period, the RISSC performs shaking map calculations using parameters from the LCCs and/or data from the event database. The recorded earthquake data are stored into an event database, to be available for distribution and visualization for further off-line analyses. The seismic network will be completed in two stages: • Deployment of 30 seismic stations along the southern Apennine chain (to date almost completed) • Setting up a carrier-class radio communication system for fast and reliable data transmission, and installation of 10 additional seismic stations...|$|R
40|$|The aim {{of present}} work is {{cultivation}} of probiotic bacteria L. acidophilus, B. breve and B. longum {{in such a}} way that the culture forms cells clusters or comprehensive biofilm on the variety of free carriers. Biofilm formation of L. acidophilus on the silica from point of view bile and acid tolerance in gastrointestinal tract was studied. While the number of living cells in planktonic form (planktonic form) at pH 1 fell by 30 %, the viability of the biofilm cells was maintained to 90 % under the same environmental conditions. The biofilm culture showed also the protection against environment contained bile. Furthermore, the possibilities of drying procedures of biofilm cultures used as commercial technologies in pharmaceutical industry were studied. The comparison of freeze-drying and fluidization bed drying showed, that freeze-drying is more suitable method, which is able to achieve higher amount of viable cells after drying than fluidization bed drying. The effectivity of freeze-drying method is dependent on the selection of suitable cryprotective medium. In this case, about 90 % higher viability after freeze drying was achieved in comparison with fluidization bed drying. Finally, the industrial processing of probiotic strains into the solid dosage form was studied. Tablets should be produced at hardness between 70 and 90 N and water activity of tablet mixture can be maintained below 0. 3. Consequently, the drying step of the tablets in a hermetically closed space with at least 10 % of silica <b>gel</b> must be <b>ensured.</b> Thereafter, the tablets contain (5. 4 ± 0. 7) 109 viable cells after 6 months of drying process. Capsule production technology has no significant effect on the cell‘s viability during production. The triplex blistering foil for primary blistering of probiotic capsules was chosen. The triplex foil, which has low values of water vapour transition rate (0. 07 g H 2 O / (m 2 × day) and oxygen transition rate (0. 01 cm 3 /m 2 × day), was chosen. Other studied blistering foils commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry are not suitable for long storage of solid dosage forms contained probiotics...|$|R
