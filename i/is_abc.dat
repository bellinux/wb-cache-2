500|$|Footage {{from the}} first episode was {{screened}} at New York Comic Con in October 2015, while the first trailer for the season was released in November. Alice Walker of Screen Rant felt that [...] "this promo highlights {{the best parts of}} the show. Fast paced and slick, Atwell is still incredibly charming....There is {{a long way to go}} before we see if they can build on the momentum from the previous season, but so far it looks like a fun adventure." [...] Conversely, Kaitlin Thomas at TV.com called the promo [...] "weird", asking, [...] "Why <b>is</b> <b>ABC</b> marketing Agent Carter like it's one of the network's casually daft melodramas instead of a well-written drama...From a tonal and thematic standpoint, the series depicted in that trailer feels like the polar opposite of what it actually is....cutting together a bunch of scenes of Peggy punching people or holding a gun does not make her a badass when its framed in this way, and frankly, it's no wonder people aren't tuning in if that's the type of show they think this is." [...] In March 2016, Maureen Ryan, writing for Variety, described the season's promotion as [...] "lackluster", and blamed it, as well as other factors that included [...] "the botched rollout of Season 2", on the season's ultimately poor viewership.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} noted that in both playwrights, but {{especially}} in Plautus, the use of different metres tends to form a pattern, which Moore {{refers to as the}} [...] "ABC succession". Often a play can be divided into sections, which follow the pattern: A = iambic senarii, B = other metres, C = trochaic septenarii. In Plautus's Menaechmi, for example, the first four sections follow the ABC scheme, and only the 5th is different; thus the whole scheme <b>is</b> <b>ABC,</b> ABC, ABC, ABC, ACBCBC. In his Pseudolus, in the same way, the ABC pattern is used four times, followed by a final scene of 91 lines in other metres, making ABC, ABC, ABC, ABC, B. However, not all plays follow this scheme. For example, in Terence's Adelphoe, the pattern is ABCBAB, ABC, BCACB, AC, ABABC. In general it appears that Terence changes mode more frequently than Plautus. Four of Plautus's plays (Cistellaria, Stichus, Epidicus, and Persa) open directly with music, omitting the customary expository speech in unaccompanied iambic senarii.|$|E
