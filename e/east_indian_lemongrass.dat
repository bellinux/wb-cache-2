50|$|The most {{significant}} contribution of AMPRS is the 'Sugandhi' (OD19), {{a variety of}} lemongrass of high yield and quality. It has been nationally accepted as the {{most significant}} variety of <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>lemongrass.</b> Diverse soil and climatic conditions ranging from hot, humid tropics of Kerala to sub-tropical conditions of sub-Himalayan regions have not been unfavourable to its growth. A prized collection of 450 varieties of this species of India and abroad {{can be found in}} this Institute. A great deal has been done by the institute for the conservation of aromatic plants. A phytochemical laboratory upgraded to regional Analytical Laboratory for medicinal and aromatic plants has been established. It is sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India.|$|E

In India, 45 species are recorded of which the economic importance is C. winterianus, C. flexuosus, C. martinii, C. nardus, C. citratus, C. pendulus, C. jwarancusa and C. khasianus. Aerial and sub-aerial parts of C. flexuosus collected from Himavath Gopala hills, Karnataka, India, were subjected to hydrodistillation for extraction of essential oil. GC and GC-MS analysis were performed to know the chemical composition of the oil. Among the 39 compounds identified in aerial parts of the plant the major compounds were citral (64. 98 %), 1, 7 -octadien- 3 -ol (10. 97 %), dimethyl oxatricyclo nonanone (9. 44 %), nerol (2. 85 %), verbenol (1. 77 %) and caryophyllene oxide (0. 71 %). In sub-aerial parts of the plant 33 compounds were identified. The analysis of sub-aerial parts showed a different chemical profile compared to aerial part and possessed citral as the major compound of upto 30. 47 %. Other compounds in sub-aerial part are Eudesmol (17. 82 %), Elemol (14. 16 %), dihydro isopropyl methyl azulene (11. 08 %),. -cadinene (1. 88 %), junipene (1. 36 %), hydroxyalloaromadendrene, juniper camphor (1. 12 %) and elemene (1. 04 %) ...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to study self- disclosure with a focus on the difference between <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> and non <b>East</b> <b>Indians.</b> The present study examined whether a sample of 76 second generation <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> Americans living in the United States scored lower than 81 non <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> on the revised Magno Self Disclosure questionnaire. It was also examined if <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> who scored higher on the Suinn Lew Self Identity Acculturation scale would score higher on the Magno Self Disclosure scale. <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> participants did score significantly lower on the measure of self-disclosure than non <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> and <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> who scored higher on the self-disclosure measure scored significantly higher on acculturation to Western United States practices. Results indicate that <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> tend to self-disclose less information than non <b>East</b> <b>Indians,</b> but those who are more acculturated disclose more, indicating their practices more closely follow American groups cultural and social norms...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{the release}} of King of Suriname {{presented}} a breakthrough for <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> music, it was quite short lived, as few artists managed to succeed Ramdew Chaitoe {{in the years to}} follow. It was not until the 1960s that another Surinamese would catapult <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> music onto the scene once again. In 1968, a woman by the name of Dropati debuted with an album of traditional wedding songs, titled, Lets Sing & Dance. Once again, although religious in nature, Dropati's songs, much like those of Ramdew Chaitoe, went on to become huge pop hits within the <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> community. Dropati's epic songs such as [...] "Gowri Pooja" [...] and [...] "Lawa" [...] became such big hits that they firmly secured her name in history as one of the pillars of Indo-Caribbean music (Dropati, 1993). Lets Sing & Dance along with King of Suriname remain two of the best selling <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> albums of all time, even to this day (Ramdew Chaitoe, 1993). The effects of {{the release of}} these two albums were tremendous. Not only did they prove <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> music as a legitimate art form, but they also united the <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> of the Caribbean regardless of whether they were Guyanese, Trinidadian, Jamaican or Surinamese. However, these two albums also showed the need for a more popular, non-religious form of <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> music, one that would combine the high pitched dholak, dhantal & tassa drum beats with the folk and Hindi lyrics that made Lets Sing & Dance and King of Suriname/The Star Melodies Of Ramdew Chaitoe becoming so popular. http://www.saxakali.com/caribbean/Hemchandra1.htm.|$|R
