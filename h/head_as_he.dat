5|$|On 3 June 1982, ANO {{operative}} Hussein Ghassan Said shot Shlomo Argov, the Israeli {{ambassador to}} Britain, {{once in the}} <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> left the Dorchester Hotel in London. Said was accompanied by Nawaf al-Rosan, an Iraqi intelligence officer, and Marwan al-Banna, Abu Nidal's cousin. Argov survived, but spent three months in a coma {{and the rest of}} his life disabled, until his death in February 2003. The PLO quickly denied responsibility for the attack.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder {{secretly}} conducts his own investigation after a man is gunned down on the White House lawn attempting to inform the President of a planned alien invasion. However, he is soon in over his <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> tries to expose further evidence of colonization.|$|E
5|$|But by {{the time}} he {{captured}} the position, the rest of his company lay dead or wounded. Singh was left alone to achieve the objective assigned. He advanced towards the second Pakistani medium machine gun post. At this juncture, he was almost blinded by a grenade that blast at his face. His Sten gun ammunition had run out. Singh moved out of the trench and lobbed grenades at the next Pakistani post. Meanwhile, he jumped into another trench, and killed two Pakistani soldiers with his bayonet. Before he was able {{to move out of the}} trench, he was hit by a bullet in his <b>head.</b> <b>As</b> <b>he</b> succumbed to his wounds, Singh hurled a grenade into a nearby Pakistani trench.|$|E

5|$|On May 26, 1943, the 32nd Infantry Regiment {{was pinned}} down by enemy {{fire in the}} {{vicinity}} of Fish Hook Ridge, in the Aleutian Islands. On his own account, Martinez led two assaults, firing into the Japanese foxholes and occasionally stopping to urge on his comrades. His example inspired the men of his unit to follow. Martinez was shot in the <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> approached one final foxhole after the second assault, dying of the wound the following day. Because of his actions the pass was taken, and its capture was an important preliminary to the end of organized hostile resistance. Martinez was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{had put a}} {{price on}} Federico Pistrucci's <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had prosecuted Bonapartist rebels, so the family fled Rome when the French {{advanced}} towards it, stopping in Frosinone, where the boys were again put into an academic school. Filippo satisfied his father with enough academic achievement that he was allowed to take a job with a painter named Mango. Deprived of his brother, Benedetto became despondent and was eventually allowed to work at Mango's. There, he quickly displayed his artistic talent. Mango told Benedetto of his brother Giuseppe Mango, a cameo engraver in Rome. With the Pope and the French having made peace, the family was able to return there, and Benedetto Pistrucci began his training as a cameo carver. He advanced quickly, also taking lessons from Stefano Tofanelli, and soon Giuseppe Mango was selling Pistrucci's carvings as his own. Realising that his works were being sold as counterfeit antiques, Pistrucci began placing a secret mark, the Greek letter λ (lambda) on his creations.|$|E
5|$|The House of Venus, {{towards the}} eastern side of the city under a {{prominent}} cypress tree, was one of the most luxurious residences in the city. It had a set of private baths and a richly decorated interior, with fine mosaics dating from the 2nd century AD showing animal and mythological scenes. There were mosaics in seven corridors and eight rooms. The central courtyard has a fanciful mosaic depicting racing chariots in a hippodrome, drawn by teams of peacocks, geese and ducks. The mosaic of Venus for which the house is named has been removed to Tangier, but in the next-door room is a still-extant mosaic showing Diana and a companion nymph being surprised by Actaeon while bathing. Actaeon is depicted with horns beginning to sprout from his <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is transformed by the angry goddess into a stag, before being chased down and killed by his own hunting dogs. The house appears to have been destroyed some time after the city's fall around 280; a mosaic depicting Cupids feeding birds with grain has been charred by what appears to have been a fire burning directly on top of it, perhaps resulting from the building being taken over by squatters who used the mosaic as the site of a hearth.|$|E

5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E
25|$|The Seventh Doctor - the TARDIS {{collided}} with Death's <b>Head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was being {{expelled from the}} Transformers' Universe. The Doctor shrunk the Transformer-scale Death's Head to human size using a Tissue Compression Eliminator, then sent him to 8162. Death's Head was subsequently hired to kill The Doctor, but was betrayed by his employer and did not complete the contract. The Doctor later {{claimed to be the}} 'unknown party' that originally stole Death's Head from his creators, Lupex and Pyra, and sent him into the Transformers Universe, hoping to shape his adventures for good.|$|E
25|$|On 23 July 1997, {{at around}} 4.30 pm, a sixteen-year-old boy {{discovered}} {{the body of}} a man, lying face down, at the base of an old water tower in Keillers Park, in downtown Göteborg. Called on site, the police determined that the man had been shot twice with a pistol. The first bullet hit him in the back and went right through the heart, while the second was fired to his <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> lay on the ground. A bag and a head cap were recovered beside the body.|$|E

25|$|Mayweather {{controlled}} the fight from the beginning, knocking Hatton {{out in the}} 10th round to retain the welterweight championship. Hatton suffered a cut over his right eye in round three; from that point, his pace and movement began to slow. In round six, Hatton lost a point for punching the back of Mayweather's <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was draped over the ropes. During the tenth round, Hatton was caught by a checked left hook thrown from Mayweather's hip; after falling headfirst into the turnbuckle, he hit the floor. Hatton made it to his feet, but was dazed. Two more lefts in quick succession knocked Hatton down again, and referee Cortez stopped the fight at 1:35 of round ten. Official scorecards read 88–82, 89–81, and 89–81 {{at the time of}} stoppage, all in favor of Mayweather.|$|E
25|$|After Giancana's {{return to}} the U.S., the police {{detailed}} officers to guard his house in Oak Park, Illinois. However, {{on the night of}} June 19, 1975, someone recalled the police detail. A gunman later entered Giancana's basement kitchen and shot him {{in the back of the}} <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was frying sausage and peppers. After Giancana fell to the ground, the gunman turned him over and shot him six more times in the face and neck. Investigators suspected the murderer was a close friend whom Giancana had let into the house. One reason for this suspicion was that Giancana, due to his heart problems, could not eat spicy foods. Therefore, he might have been cooking for a friend. Giancana was killed shortly before he was scheduled to appear before the Church Committee investigating CIA and Cosa Nostra collusion in plots to assassinate President John F. Kennedy.|$|E
25|$|The Ohioans withdrew {{and were}} {{replaced}} in their position by the 15th Kentucky. As Johnson's men ran low on ammunition, Brig. Gen. Patrick R. Cleburne's brigade entered the battle at about 3:40p.m. Cleburne's horse, Dixie, {{was killed by}} an artillery shell, which also wounded Cleburne in the ankle, but he kept his troops moving forward. As they advanced up the slope, they were subjected to Confederate artillery fire; Cleburne later surmised that the friendly fire was caused by his men wearing blue uniform trousers, which had been captured from Union soldiers at Richmond. On Cleburne's left, Brig. Gen. Daniel W. Adams's brigade joined the attack against the 15th Kentucky, which had been reinforced by three companies of the 3rd Ohio. The Union troops retreated to the west toward the Russell House, McCook's headquarters. Lytle {{was wounded in the}} <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> attempted to rally his men. He was left on the field for dead, and was captured.|$|E

500|$|Merrick's {{death was}} ruled {{accidental}} and the certified {{cause of death}} was asphyxia, caused by the weight of his <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> lay down. Treves, who performed an autopsy on the body, said that Merrick had died of a dislocated neck. Knowing that Merrick had always slept sitting upright out of necessity, Treves {{came to the conclusion that}} Merrick must have [...] "made the experiment", attempting to sleep lying down [...] "like other people".|$|E
500|$|In contrast, {{the offices}} of Capitol Pictures and Lipnick's house are pristine, lavishly decorated, and {{extremely}} comfortable. The company's rooms are bathed in sunlight, and Ben Geisler's office faces a lush array of flora. Barton meets Lipnick in one scene beside an enormous, spotless swimming pool.

He preferred [...] "The Big Dipper", which was inspired by his friends who saw him dip his <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> walked through doorways. After his basketball career ended, Chamberlain played volleyball in the short-lived International Volleyball Association, was president of this organization, and is enshrined in the IVA Hall of Fame for his contributions. Chamberlain was also a successful businessman, authored several books, and appeared in the movie Conan the Destroyer. He was a lifelong bachelor, and became notorious for his claim to have had sexual intercourse {{with as many as}} 20,000 women.|$|E
500|$|A 2009 study {{estimated}} that ankylosaurids could swing their tails at 100 degrees laterally and the mainly cancellous clubs {{would have a}} lowered moment of inertia and been effective weapons. The {{study also found that}} while large ankylosaurid tail clubs were capable of breaking bones, medium and small clubs were not. Despite the feasibility of tail swinging, the researchers could not determine whether ankylosaurids used their clubs for defense against potential predators, in intraspecific combat or both. In 1993, Tony Thulborn proposed that the tail club of ankylosaurids primarily acted as a decoy for the <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> thought the tail too short and inflexible to have an effective reach; the [...] "dummy head" [...] would lure a predator close to the tail, where it could be stricken. Carpenter has rejected this idea, as tail club shape is highly variable among ankylosaurids, even in the same genus.|$|E
