40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{research}} the secrecy of <b>Jesus</b> <b>identity</b> in the synoptic gospels, with a special focus on the gospel of Mark. It was the late theologian William Wrede who coined the term Messianic Secret, in 1901. By which, it means the specific theme that can be found in various bible verses in the synoptic gospels, where Jesus demands secrecy after he performs healing miracles and exorcisms, and after private conversations with the apostles. The main question of this study is what is the purpose for the author of the Gospel of Mark to keep the identity of Jesus a secret, in comparison to Matthew and Luke? The method used to answer this question is redaction criticism, which focuses on the editor of the bible text. The study focuses on five bible stories, each found in the synoptic gospels, with a total of fifteen bible pericopes. The conclusion of this study is that the author of the Gospel of Mark wants to keep <b>Jesus</b> <b>identity</b> a secret, because the author believes that the people and the apostles need time to comprehend the true identity and the coming suffering of Jesus, who is the Messiah...|$|E

5000|$|The sura {{opens with}} the Bismillah and five Arabic letters: Kaf Ha Ya 'Ayn Sad. [...] The {{remaining}} 97 ayat {{can be divided}} into three primary sections. The first section, verses 2-40, consists of the narrative of the prophet Zachariah and the birth of his son John, the story of Mary and the birth of her son Jesus, and a commentary on <b>Jesus's</b> true <b>identity</b> which rejects the Christian claim that he is God's son. The second section, verses 41-65, tells of Abraham's departure from his family's idolatrous ways and then references many other prophets. The text discusses the various responses of those who heard their prophecy and the fates those hearers met; throughout these descriptions, the oneness of God is emphasized. The third section, verses 66-98, confirms the reality of resurrection and offers depictions of the Day of Judgment alongside depictions of this life.|$|R

25|$|The {{first and}} {{earliest}} view of Jesus in Islamic thought {{is that of}} a prophet; a human being chosen by God to present both a judgement upon humanity for worshipping idols and a challenge to turn to the one, true God, is foundational for all Muslims. From this basis reflected upon all previous prophets through the lens of Muslim <b>identity,</b> <b>Jesus</b> {{is no more than a}} messenger repeating the same message of the ages. Jesus is not traditionally perceived as divine, yet Muslim ideology is careful not to view Jesus as less than this, for in doing so would be sacrilegious and similar to rejecting a recognized Islamic prophet. The miracles of Jesus and the Qur'anic titles attributed to Jesus demonstrate the power of God rather than the divinity of Jesus—the same power behind the message of all prophets.|$|R

40|$|This thesis J 4, 4 - 42 : Jesus and the Samaritan woman {{deals with}} an exegesis of the {{conversation}} between Jesus and the Samaritan woman {{as well as with}} a deeper theological interpretation of themes from this conversation: living water and worshipping of God in Spirit and truth. At first, a langugage analysis is performed, because an exegesis of the text is based on it. The exegesis emphasises a place of the pericope in a context of John's gospel, stylistic specialities of John as well as a graduality in a knowledge of <b>Jesus's</b> truth <b>identity</b> from a perspective of the woman and Samaritan people from the town. It is pointed out that living water can be thought as all that Jesus gives to people here on earth for their redemption. Worshipping in Spirit and truth is interpreted as a relation of a man to God that is given by a personal presence of God in a human heart thanks to a faith in Jesus. Futhermore, the thesis is concerned with a description of Samaritan history from a biblical point of view as well as from a perspective of Samaritans themselves and with basic articles of the Samaritan religion that appear in the text (Mt. Gerizim, person of Taheb). What is also considered is a relevancy of the pericope nowadays from {{point of view of a}} man who is calling by God. Consequently, the text is given into a [...] ...|$|R
40|$|According to John Meier, the {{identity}} of the historical Jesus was shaped by early Jewish understandings of the prophet Elijah. This article assesses five points of alleged similarity between Jesus and Elijah and draws attention to two neglected distinctions: the distinction between the earthly Elijah and the eschatological one, and the distinction between the formative and interpretative functions of the figure of Elijah. Meier’s construal of the intention and <b>identity</b> of <b>Jesus</b> is put into question. Whereas it is possible to take Jesus’ election of the Twelve as an indication of his intention {{to play the role of}} Elijah, the present article argues instead for an Isaianic background of the key saying Q 22 : 30 b. The role according to which <b>Jesus</b> shaped his <b>identity</b> was that of Isaiah’s anointed prophet, whose task was also to begin the restoration of Israel by appointing those who would soon be “judging” the twelve tribes...|$|R

The demon recognizes Jesus as [...] "the Holy one of God", the first time Jesus' supernatural opponents are shown to know his true <b>identity.</b> <b>Jesus</b> simply says [...] "Be quiet, and come out of him!", healing the man with words alone. The people are amazed. This follows a path Mark often uses, that of {{a description of the}} affliction, Jesus' cure of the affliction, and then a demonstration of the cure to others. [...] The power of Jesus' word over the demon might be Mark's way of trying to show to his audience, perhaps under the threat of persecution, that Jesus' message will overcome evil. [...] By showing Jesus' teaching first before his exorcism Mark might be placing emphasis on Jesus' teachings as more important that any miracle he could perform.|$|R
50|$|The post-resurrection {{appearances}} of Jesus are the earthly {{appearances of}} Jesus to his followers after his death, burial and resurrection. Believers point {{to them as}} proof of the Resurrection of <b>Jesus</b> and his <b>identity</b> as Messiah, seated in heaven on the right hand of God (the doctrine of the Exaltation of Christ). There is a strong early tradition that the family and immediate followers of Jesus, and the apostle Paul, had visionary and mystical experiences of Jesus after his death. Several decades later, when the gospels of Matthew, Luke and John were being written, the emphasis had shifted to the physical nature of the resurrection, while still overlapping with the earlier concept of a divine exaltation of Jesus' soul. This development {{can be linked to}} the changing make-up of the Christian community: Paul and the earliest Christ-followers were Jewish, and Second Temple Judaism emphasised the life of the soul; the gospel-writers, in an overwhelmingly Greco-Roman church, stressed instead the pagan belief in the hero who is immortalised and deified in his physical body.|$|R

The Jesse Tree was the only prophecy in the Old Testament to be so literally and frequently illustrated, and so came also to stand for the Prophets, and their foretelling of Christ, in general. Both the St-Denis and Chartres windows include columns of prophets, as do many depictions. Often they carry banderoles with a quotation from their writings, and they may point to Christ, as the foretold Messiah. [...] The inclusion of kings and prophets was also an assertion of the inclusion and relevance in the biblical canon of books that some groups had rejected in the past.|$|R
40|$|Jesus’ table {{fellowship}} {{with tax}} collectors and sinners: {{aspects of a}} missional ecclesiology Christian churches with a historically powerful socio-cultural presence often have to adjust to a new marginalised and disempowered existence, stripped of influence in an increasingly secular society dominated by postmodern values. Many churches view this as a threat, and attempt to protect themselves through strengthening of the boundaries {{between them and the}} surrounding community, citing the holiness of the church as reason. This results in isolated and exclusive faith communities with no missionary identity, and a split between ecclesiology and missiology. This article proposes that Jesus’ table fellowship with tax collectors and sinners provides a motif for restating a missional ecclesiology. <b>Jesus</b> defined his <b>identity</b> as the Holy One of God by removal of boundaries and an inclusive seeking out of the marginalised in the society of his time. He shaped a new community of God’s people among them. Likewise, a missional church will understand her holiness not as separation from the world, but as service to God’s redemptive purposes, and will devote herself to inviting vulnerability and redemptive entering into the lives of others similar to the incarnation of the Son of God. This will result in the conscious social relocation of the church to the disempowered margins of society, {{as a sign of the}} eschatological community of Christ that He continues to gather around Himself in the present. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Generalate of Claudio Acquaviva: The Origins of the Jesuit Myth of China Michela Catto Adapting and {{accommodating}} {{in pursuit}} of evangelization à partir d’en haute, adopting the customs and habits of Confucian mandarins, speaking and dressing {{in the manner of}} the Chinese, and establishing a dialogue through science: these were four characteristics of the Chinese mission of the Society of <b>Jesus,</b> a Jesuit <b>identity</b> that was “forged” by the Chinese, as noted in the subtitle of a 2002 essay by Nicolas Standaert. All of these choices were made during the generalate of Claudio Acquaviva (1581 - 1615) and were accepted and codified by the general. To his generalate belongs as much the overcoming of suspicions that the Society of Jesus in Europe could feed toward the adaptation of Chinese habits and customs (with the approval of Alessandro Valignano’s Cerimoniale) as the structural and ideological choices of the Chinese missiological interpretive model. I am not referring to the simple ratification of a model that was being formed de facto in China. The general found himself having to select and decide between the different interpretations that his missionaries were compiling about China and leaning toward a positive model of humanity (favoring the judgments of José de Acosta more than the bellicose ideas of Alonso Sánchez), about its culture and its government (the adoption of the Confucian ratio studiorum and the decisive distancing from Buddhist monks, with whom the first Jesuits were naturally equated at the outset), and for a decodification of Confucianism as a doctrine of ethical and moral values, favoring and preferring the proposals of Matteo Ricci to the atheism of the Chinese religions described by João Rodrigues and the missionaries who arrived in China from Japan. The diffusion of this interpretation of China – the most noted and widespread in Europe at least until the question of Chinese Rites (1645) became public knowledge – through the publication the publication of the litterae annuae and the histories of the Jesuit mission in China not only placed the Jesuit seal on the Far East). It also codified the first myth about China that, even though it was later vigorously challenged, shaped all of European culture during the early modern period...|$|R
40|$|This thesis rereads central {{texts of}} Paul’s letters to {{demonstrate}} that Paul’s speech about God, Jesus Christ, and the Spirit is intricately intertwined so that talk about {{any one of the}} three (God, Jesus, or the Spirit) implies reference to all of them together (God, Jesus, and the Spirit). The first part of the Introduction describes how the current landscape of Pauline scholarship has largely given up this way of articulating the dynamics of Paul’s God-, Christ-, and Spirit-discourse. Eschewing explicitly trinitarian language in favor of other conceptualities, much recent Pauline scholarship has opted for discussing the relationship between God and Jesus in terms of ‘high’ or ‘low’ christology. After summarizing this trend, {{the second part of the}} Introduction describes trinitarian theologies as representing a better approach that will serve to open a fresh angle on Paul, despite its conceptual difference from Paul’s own speech. The next four chapters defend that supposition with detailed exegesis. Chapter 1 considers how the identity of God is shaped by Paul’s christology: God’s identity is only what it is in relation to Jesus. Chapters 2 and 3 consider the converse: how the <b>identity</b> of <b>Jesus</b> is shaped by his relation to God. These latter two chapters also rebut the charge that Paul’s alleged ‘subordinationist’ christology renders a trinitarian, relational reading of the divine identity untenable. Drawing on the conclusion found in the history of trinitarian theologies that the oneness or unity between God and Jesus does not come into conflict with the distinction between God and Jesus, Chapters 2 and 3 argue that the mutuality that exists between God and Jesus is asymmetrical but not for that reason graspable with the concept of ‘subordinationism’. Chapter 4 brings the Spirit into the mutual, reciprocal relationship between God and <b>Jesus.</b> The Spirit’s <b>identity</b> is derived from God and Jesus’; yet the Spirit is also involved in the sequence of events whereby God and Jesus are identified. The Spirit’s identity is relationally determined, but also God and Jesus are who they are only by virtue of the Spirit’s agency which is exercised by God in the resurrection of Jesus. In this way, despite its historical distance from Paul and its different idiom, trinitarian theology is shown to illumine a way through interpretive difficulties in Paul’s letters that the more recent concepts of ‘high’ and ‘low’ christology have hitherto been unable to illumine...|$|R
