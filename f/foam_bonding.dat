The objective of this research was to develop and implement an on-line gypsum wallboard manufacturing expert system incorporating on-line process monitoring information and statistical process control. In support of this objective, several sub-objectives were accomplished. First, an expert system addressing the major problems associated with gypsum wallboard manufacturing was developed. Second, manufacturing problems that utilized quantifiable process data in their problem solving procedures were identified for incorporation into the system. Third, the statistical process control techniques of control charting to filter process information were applied to selected problems in the manufacturing process. Finally, the system was implemented and verified. Several stagesand accompanying methods marked the development of this system. Identifying crucial parameters for expert system development, acquiring knowledge for those identified parameters, coding the knowledge base, adapting statistical process control (SPC) techniques to filter process data, and lastly, implementing the system in the study facility were the elements of the full expert system. Nine major categories of problems associated with gypsum wallboard manufacturing were identified and addressed by the expert system. Specifically, they were various types of problems associated with voids, the <b>foam,</b> <b>bond,</b> wallboard additives, the board line, the knife and inverter, the takeoff of the process end, and the warehouse.

40|$|In this paper, the postbuckling {{analysis}} is performed for shear deformable sandwich beams which comprise a functionally graded porous metal <b>foam</b> core <b>bonded</b> by two face layers. The beam model {{is based on}} the Timoshenko beam theory and von Kármán type nonlinear strain-displacement relationships. The material constants of the porous core vary smoothly and continuously along the thickness direction. Three porosity distributions, i. e., a symmetric non-uniform porosity distribution, an asymmetric non-uniform porosity distribution, and a uniform distribution are considered. The coefficients of porosity and mass density determine the variation amplitudes of material constants and are related by using typical mechanical properties of an open-cell metal foam. The nonlinear governing equation system is derived and then solved with the aid of the Ritz method in conjunction with a direct iterative algorithm. The adopted Ritz trial functions satisfy the employed geometric boundary condition: clamped-clamped. The postbuckling behaviors of the sandwich porous beams are examined by conducting a parametric study.

40|$|The NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) uses {{commercial}} waveguide {{windows on}} the output waveguide of Ka-band (32 GHz) low-noise amplifiers. Mechanical failure of these windows resulted in an unacceptable loss in tracking time. To address this issue, a new Ka-band WR- 28 waveguide window has been designed, fabricated, and tested. The window uses a slab of low-loss, low-dielectric constant <b>foam</b> that is <b>bonded</b> into a 1 / 2 -wave-thick waveguide/flange. The foam is a commercially available, rigid, closed-cell polymethacrylimide. It has excellent electrical properties with a dielectric constant of 1. 04, and a loss tangent of 0. 01. It is relatively strong with a tensile strength of 1 MPa. The material is virtually impermeable to helium. The finished window exhibits a leak rate of less than 3 x 10 (exp - 3) cu cm/s with helium. The material is also chemically resistant and can be cleaned with acetone. The window is constructed by fabricating a window body by brazing a short length of WR- 28 copper waveguide into a standard rectangular flange, and machining the resulting part to a thickness of 4. 6 mm. The foam is machined to a rectangular shape with a dimension of 7. 06 x 3. 53 mm. The <b>foam</b> is <b>bonded</b> into the body with a two-part epoxy. After curing, the excess glue and foam are knife-trimmed by hand. The finished window has a loss of less than 0. 08 dB (2 %) and a return loss of greater than 25 dB at 32 GHz. This meets the requirements for the DSN application. The window is usable for most applications over the entire 26 -to- 40 -GHz waveguide band. The window return loss can be tuned to a required frequency by var y in g {{the thickness of the}} window slightly. Most standard waveguide windows use a thin membrane of material bonded into a recess in a waveguide flange, or sandwiched between two flanges with a polymer seal. Designs using the recessed window are prone to mechanical failure over time due to constraints on the dimensions of the recess that allow the bond to fail.

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for bonding low-density nanoporous metal foam components to a substrate using solder that is sputtered onto the surfaces. Metal foams have unusual properties that make them excellent choices for many applications, and as technologies for processing these materials are evolving, their use in industry is increasing dramatically. Metal foams are lightweight and have advantageous dynamic properties, which make them excellent choices for many structural applications. They also provide good acoustic damping, low thermal conductivity, and excellent energy absorption characteristics. Therefore, these materials are commonly used in the automotive, aerospace, construction, and biomedical industries. The synthesis of nanoporous metal foams with a cell size of less then 1 {micro}m is an emerging technology {{that is expected to}} lead to widespread application of metal foams in microdevices, such as sensors and actuators. One of the challenges to manufacturing components from metal foams is that they can be difficult to attach to other structures without degrading their properties. For example, traditional liquid adhesives cannot be used because they are absorbed into foams. The problem of bonding or joining can be particularly difficult for small-scale devices made from nanoporous foam, due to the requirement for a thin bond layer. The current study addresses this problem and develops a method of soldering a nanoporous metal foam to a substrate with a bond thickness of less than 2 {micro}m. There are many applications that require micro-scale metal <b>foams</b> precisely <b>bonded</b> to substrates. This study was motivated by a physics experiment that used a laser to drive a shock wave through an aluminum foil and into a copper foam, {{in order to determine the}} speed of the shock in the copper foam. To avoid disturbing the shock, the interface between the copper foam and the aluminum substrate had to be as thin as possible. There are many other applications that could benefit from the bonding technology developed in this study, such as small-scale lightweight structural members, high-strength thermal insulating layers for electronics, and micro-scale mechanical dampers, to name but a few. Each of these applications requires one or more small metal <b>foam</b> components precisely <b>bonded</b> to a substrate. Several methods for <b>bonding</b> metal <b>foam</b> components have been developed by previous researchers. Macroscopic metal foam parts have been successfully bonded by laser welding to create T-sections and butt joints. Ultrasonic welding has been used to join aluminum sheet metal to aluminum foam for structural applications. These methods work well for <b>bonding</b> large <b>foam</b> components, but reducing these methods to a smaller length scale would be challenging. One method that has shown great potential for bonding layers of metal foams to substrates is a brazing process that uses a sputter-deposited interface material. Shirzadi et al. [9] have demonstrated bonds between stainless steel foam and a stainless steel substrate using a layer of copper-titanium filler metal that is sputtered onto the interface surfaces. The foam pieces that they bonded were approximately 10 mm in diameter and 10 mm thick with a cell size of approximately 200 {micro}m. After depositing the filler material, pressing the materials together, and heating them with an induction heater, bonds were achieved without causing significant damage to the foam. The current study also uses a sputter-deposited interface material to <b>bond</b> <b>foam</b> to a substrate. However, in contrast to previous work, the current study examines bonding microscale pieces of fragile nanoporous metal foam. In this study, a method is developed to bond a thin sheet of fragile, low-density nanoporous copper foam to an aluminum foil substrate of thickness 40 {micro}m. By sputter depositing an indium-silver alloy onto the foam and the substrate, a solder joint with a thickness of less than 2 {micro}m was achieved...|$|R
