5|$|Braham flew in {{the first}} wave. As Braham's wave reached Leeuwarden in the Netherlands and while {{four of the five}} RAF fighters made no contact, Braham {{attracted}} two enemy night fighters. The Messerschmitt Bf 110s were from IV./Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (Night Fighter Wing 1). Five had taken off under the command of Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer—who finished the war as the most successful night fighter of all time with 121 air victories. Schnaufer led his flight out toward the echo but turned back himself after engine trouble. Using his Serrate radar detector, Braham and his radar operator picked up the emissions made by the German fighters' Lichtenstein radar. He gained on and shot down Feldwebel Georg Kraft, an Experten with 15 air victories from 4./NJG 1. Kraft was killed. Another Bf 110 had witnessed the action and attempted to engage Braham but was outmanoeuvred and dispatched also. Its pilot, Feldwebel Heinz Vinke was the only member of his crew to survive. Braham considered shooting at one crew member, likely Vinke, who he had seen parachute out of the aircraft, but Bill Gregory persuaded him not to. Braham's Beaufighter was nearly struck by debris from the last victim. Braham had a habit of opening fire at very close range and the resulting disintegration of the Messerschmitt hurled debris at the closely following Beaufighter. One reason for firing at close-range was Braham's high state of fatigue. In such a state Braham could barely <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> open. Whenever he peered ahead they smarted and misted.|$|E
500|$|Richard Johnson, under {{contract}} to MGM, was cast as Dr. Markway. Wise saw Johnson in a Royal Shakespeare Company production of The Devils. Impressed with his acting, he offered him the role. Johnson later said he received invaluable film acting advice from Wise. Wise told him to <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> steady, to blink less, and to try not to time his acting (Wise said he {{would take care of}} that in the editing room). Johnson also credited Wise with helping him to craft a much more natural acting performance. Russ Tamblyn, also {{under contract}} with MGM, initially turned down the role as Luke because he felt that the character was [...] "a jerk", although he thought that the script was very good. The studio forced him to reconsider, threatening him with suspension. Tamblyn told the British cinema magazine Film Review in 1995 that while reading the script a second time, he realised the character was much more interesting. [...] "This is the ironic part," [...] he said, [...] "it {{turned out to be one}} of my favourite films that I've been in!" ...|$|E

When I saw Bud lie down I remembered what Dick had whispered. I pretended to be absorbed in my fishing, but really I was watching Greaser. As usual, he was smoking, and appeared listless, but he still held on to the lasso.|$|R
2500|$|Much of the {{terminology}} {{appears to be}} fluid, relying primarily on rhyming with the intended meaning. One example provided by Daniel William Barrett, in his book, [...] "Life and Work Among The Navvies," [...] contains the following navvy slang; [...] "'now, Jack, I'm goin' to get a tiddley wink of pig's ear; keep your mince pies on the Billy Gorman.'" [...] This means the speaker's going for a beer, and asking the person being addressed, to <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> on the foreman.

2500|$|After Vinnie Paul slammed Superjoint Ritual, saying Anselmo {{could not}} even <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> open, Anselmo replied, [...] "I just hear a big and sad yellowbelly crybaby fuckin' knowing that his meal ticket is in a {{different}} fuckin' band... You would have to know those guys to really understand where I was coming from. They're scared of their own fuckin' shadows. And, all that said, I wish them the best of fuckin' luck. I still love 'em." [...] Anselmo had engaged in a war of words with Dimebag {{since the fall of}} Pantera, culminating in the statement [...] "Dimebag deserves to be beaten severely" [...] in the December 2004 edition of the UK's Metal Hammer magazine. Initially, he denied making the statement, but later changed his story in a VH1 Behind the Music special on Pantera, claiming that the comment had been lighthearted and made off the record. However, Vinnie Paul told the press that he had heard the audio files of the interview and that Anselmo had not been misquoted.|$|E

[...] He invited me in, remarking, ‘Sit down, Standing Bear. [...] I have sent for you because I want you to tell you {{something}} of importance. [...] The Big Chief of this country, the King of England, has promised to attend a performance of our show. [...] Now I want you to go back to your people, call them all together, and tell them all about it. [...] Tell them {{to be very careful about}} their clothes; to see that they are perfectly clean and neat for that particular performance. [...] If anything needs repairs, tell them to attend to it at once. [...] We must please the King at this performance. [...] Rehearse your Indians well so they will do their best for me. [...] If the King likes our show, it will please the people of this country. [...] I have observed your own costume. [...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, I want you to do an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England. [...] I had a beautiful lance, and as the dance proceeded I worked over toward the King’s box. [...] There I shook the lance in his face and danced my very prettiest, you may be sure. [...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself. [...] I saw that I had made a hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard. [...] Buffalo Bill brought the King over to me and we were introduced. [...] We shook hands, although neither of us said a word. [...] But I had the honor of being introduced to King Edward VII, the monarch of Great Britain.” ...|$|E
