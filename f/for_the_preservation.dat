The formulations contain chromium based on the oxide CrO3 between 35.3% and 65.5%. In the United States, 65,300 metric tons of CCA solution were used in 1996.|$|E

5|$|In the Aegean Sea, Greece has {{allocated}} a {{large area}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> of the Mediterranean monk seal and its habitat. The Greek Alonissos Marine Park, that extends around the Northern Sporades islands, is the main action ground of the Greek MOm organisation. MOm is greatly involved in raising awareness in the general public, fundraising for the helping of the monk seal preservation cause, in Greece and wherever needed. Greece is currently investigating the possibility of declaring another monk seal breeding site as a national park, and also has integrated some sites in the NATURA 2000 protection scheme. The legislation in Greece is very strict towards seal hunting, and in general, the public is very much aware and supportive of the effort <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> of the Mediterranean monk seal.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{literature}} has been preserved {{on a wide}} variety of media. This includes papyrus scrolls and packets, limestone or ceramic ostraca, wooden writing boards, monumental stone edifices and coffins. Texts preserved and unearthed by modern archaeologists represent a small fraction of ancient Egyptian literary material. The area of the floodplain of the Nile is under-represented because the moist environment is unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> of papyri and ink inscriptions. On the other hand, hidden caches of literature, buried for thousands of years, have been discovered in settlements on the dry desert margins of Egyptian civilization.|$|E

5|$|EU {{legislation}} {{makes no}} provision <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> {{and protection of}} breed types, which, {{in the case of}} Limousins, have been maintained and the breed developed through a rigorously enforced breed standard for over a century. An attempt to protect the integrity of the French Limousin Herd Book by opposing the entry of foreign purebreds that may have been subject to less stringent selection criteria is prohibited under EU legislation because it is considered to hinder intra-Community trade. Current EU legislation with its focus on free trade thus has the potential to result in the dilution of purebred breeds and loss of efficiency gains arising from crossbreeding.|$|E

She was also selected as the first female delegate-at-large to the Democratic National Convention in 1920.

5|$|From the 2nd to the 4th centuries, the Christian {{authors who}} would become the Latin Church Fathers were in active {{dialogue}} with the Classical tradition, within {{which they had been}} educated. Tertullian, a convert to Christianity from Roman Africa, was the contemporary of Apuleius and one of the earliest prose authors to establish a distinctly Christian voice. After the conversion of Constantine, Latin literature is dominated by the Christian perspective. When the orator Symmachus argued <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> of Rome's religious traditions, he was effectively opposed by Ambrose, the bishop of Milan and future saint—a debate preserved by their missives.|$|E

5|$|Plans for {{restoring}} the courthouse had been proposed {{even before it}} fell into disuse. In 1961, the architectural modelist Theodore Conrad proposed converting the building into a new city hall for Jersey City. The plan would have created a mall {{in front of the}} building and surrounded it with additional city buildings and a museum. Another proposal would house a branch of the New Jersey State Museum in the building. Conrad led a citizens group that lobbied <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> of the building, and got it listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The award-winning restoration project resulted in the courthouse being reopened in 1985 for the use of the civil courts and other county offices.|$|E
5|$|The BBC Film Library {{was turned}} into a {{combined}} Film & Videotape Library <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> of both media. The Film Library at the time held only 47 episodes of 1960s Doctor Who; they had once held 53, but six episodes had either been junked or gone missing. Junkings at BBC Enterprises, however, continued until the intervention of Ian Levine, a record producer and fan of the programme. Following the transfer of episodes still held by Enterprises, there were 152 episodes of Doctor Who no longer held by the BBC, although subsequent efforts have reduced that number to 97.|$|E
