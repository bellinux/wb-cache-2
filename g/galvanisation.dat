In June 1974, {{after the release of}} Henry Cow's second album, Virgin Records (Henry Cow's record label) commissioned a solo record from Frith. They were impressed with his musical ability and gave him free rein to record whatever he wanted.

[...] Frith spent four days in July 1974 recording at the Kaleidophon Studios in London, and the resulting experimentation and the process of <b>galvanisation</b> and pressure led to the [...] "radical approach to the guitar" [...] on the album.

50|$|In September 1986, Audi {{released}} a new Typ 89 Audi 80 for the 1987 model {{year on the}} European market and introduced it elsewhere within a year.

Although often called the typ 89 even among knowledgeable Audi enthusiasts, the official and correct nomenclature was its production code Typ 89 from 1987 to 1989, and Typ 8A from 1990 onwards (in line with a restructuring of many VW platform designations). It introduced a new aerodynamic look and a fully galvanised bodyshell. This was the first mid-sized car to feature a fully zinc-coated body, giving it longevity and durability against corrosion perforation. This protective shield proved to be so effective that Audi extended its corrosion perforation warranty from the originally offered ten years to twelve years (during early pre-production, the body was expected to be good for only eight years). Audi still uses zinc <b>galvanisation</b> for all current steel-bodied models.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of his third presidential term, Vladimir Putin has consistently invoked conservative ideology. Thus he legitimises the Kremlin’s new political strategy, the aim of which is to stabilise the regime and prevent any political mobilisation in Russia around a liberal agenda. This strategy is also intended to strengthen the legitimacy of the current model of government, by portraying it as ‘traditional’ for Russia; and to justify the government’s repressive and anti-Western policies. It also includes the policy of reintegrating the post-Soviet space under the auspices of Moscow, as evidenced by the annexation of Crimea and the Novorossiya project. This strategy was devised {{as a response to the}} <b>galvanisation</b> of adherents of liberalisation in Russia, namely the new middle class and a part of the business and administrative elites who publicly demonstrated their dissatisfaction with the regime in 2011 and 2012.

30|$|Corrosion is {{a natural}} {{destructive}} phenomenon where pure metals interact with the environment to form non-desirable metallic compounds. Protection of metals from corrosion {{is one of the}} major economic issues. Mild steel (MS) is an important metal which is widely applied in oil wells, constructional materials, automobiles and many other industries due to its excellent mechanical properties and low cost [1]. Hydrochloric acid solutions (approximately 0.5 – 1  M) are widely used in several industrial processes, some of the important fields of application being acid pickling of steel, chemical cleaning and processing, ore production and oil well acidification [2]. Corrosion of MS when exposed to aggressive acids, such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid results in such damage that needs either repair or replacement of the part leading to huge loss of resources. Corrosion of MS is worth investigating because such corrosions cause damage to pipelines, bridges, marine structures and construction materials bringing heavy economic losses worldwide. Corrosion is also one of the major concerns in the durability of materials and structures; and studies are continuously carried out to develop effective methods for corrosion control [3]. There are a number of methods for corrosion control but the choice depends on economics, safety requirements and technical considerations. Mitigation of MS corrosion is achieved through such means as <b>galvanisation,</b> organic coating (enamel, polymer, oils etc.) and using corrosion inhibitors [4, 5, 6] which form film by adsorbing on the metal surface. The organic corrosion inhibitors although proved to be the best for the protection of MS, but they are restricted in some cases because of their toxicity. Therefore, the best means of protection is to adapt an inhibitor which is eco-friendly, easily soluble and effective at low concentration. The class of organic compounds which satisfy these conditions are drugs and their derivatives which are highly water soluble.|$|E
40|$|A {{very severe}} {{drawback}} of metal construction parts made {{of iron and}} steel is their susceptibility to corrosion. There {{are a number of}} processes for attaining long-term material protection. In the case of hot-dip <b>galvanisation</b> the parts are coated with negatively electric metals, chiefly zinc. The surface of the metal being subjected to this process must be bright. To achieve this the parts are first pickled in a hydrochloric acid bath. In the course of time the hydrochloric acid used for the pickling becomes spent as rust, hammer scales, iron and so on are deposited in the solution. This waste mixture has to be disposed of. In the techniques most commonly used up to now (oil-emulsion separation, CP units) the waste mixture is neutralized/precipitated and subsequently deposited on an special dump. The HYC-process recovers from the waste mixture valuable raw materials (iron chloride and zinc chloride) which can then be reintegrated in the processing cycle. A multiphase process removes the secondary constituents fouling the product or interfering with the separation process. The liquid is passed through an activated charcoal adsorption unit to remove the grease, inhibitors etc. from it. In a two-phase carburizing process heavy metals introduced through the steel being galvanized and the zinc used for this purpose are precipitated. The core of the unit consists of a zinc specific liquid-liquid extraction in which the iron chloride and zinc chloride are separated from one another. After passing through several re-treatment phases in an evaporation unit both the FeCl_ 2 and the ZnCl_ 2 solutions have reached the concentration desired. (orig.)

40|$|This {{article has}} two main objectives. First, it {{provides}} a critical appraisal of the theoretical accounts of globalisation/regionalisation provided by the left structuralist or ‘hyperglobalist’ approach and the new constitutionalist version of the neo-Gramscian approach. It is argued that both approaches have been essentially negative in their evaluation of the role and position of organised labour in the changing IPE. Such pessimism is particularly marked (perhaps not surprisingly) in the left structuralist approach, but nevertheless (and more surprisingly) still pervades the new constitutionalism. I argue that in both cases pessimism is to a significant degree misplaced and I seek to show the various points at which, in my view, each approach has gone wrong. Generally speaking, however, I {{would suggest that the}} problems highlighted have rather less to do with the general theoretical perspectives deployed (for both left structuralism and neo-Gramscian analysis have a great deal to offer the study of IPE) than with the specific treatments of these approaches critiqued here. Briefly stated, these treatments suffer from a common failure to conceptualise changing world orders in terms of the dialectic of structure and agency. Second, the article focuses on a more empirical analysis of (mainly British) labour movement agency within the context of European integration since the mid 1980 s, concentrating particularly, although not exclusively, on trade union responses to and understandings of economic and monetary union (EMU). This is designed partly as a corrective to the new constitutionalists’ emphasis on elite agency. I argue that the evidence indicates a significant <b>galvanisation</b> of labour agency at the European Union (EU) level. This needs to be understood partly in terms of a (negative/defensive) response to economic globalisation but also as a positive engagement with the globalisation/regionalism, structure/agency dialectic which reveals broader and more positive trade union purposes and objectives grounded in what Robert Cox has called ‘critical theory’ and directed at forms of social transformation. 4 This engagement has, in turn, been partly facilitated by the EU’s own determination of the structure/agency dialectic evident in the changing and politically contested (as opposed to elite-determined) governance structures of the EU. I argue that the starting theoretical assumptions of European labour movement agency are positive in their assertion of feasible alternatives to neoliberal economic governance at the EU level. This corresponds to the more optimistic version of neo-Gramscianism that has informed the work of Alain Lipiet...|$|E
