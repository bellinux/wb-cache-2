We have been questioning the over-intensification of agriculture from 20 years. BSE: never again: we {{want to change the}} agriculture policies in Europe. My statement about agriculture practice, environment, policies and strategies will focus on following points: Intensive production still remains the model and receives great support from the CAP, with great damages for environment; During the last ten years, under pressure of public opinion, the CAP was just little greened, but not put on a sustainable way; Will the next CAP just add more green paint or can the next CAP stop the destructive industrialisation of food production and give priority to the interests of consumers, farmers, and environment? It is true that the EU has increasing concern about the damages caused by over-intensive farming. But {{it is also true that}} the EU never had the political will to stop over-intensive farming and to support sustainable family farming, even if the damages represent huge costs for the society...|$|E

40|$|To {{increase}} profitability, farmers often {{decide to}} form strategic partnerships with other farmers, pooling their resources and outputs for greater efficiency and scale. These coordination decisions can have far-reaching and complex implications for overall {{food supply chain}} structural emergence, which in turn impacts system outcomes and long-term sustainability. In this paper, we describe an agent-based model that explores the impacts of <b>farmer</b> <b>coordination</b> decisions {{on the development of}} food supply chain structure over time. This model focuses on one type of coordination mechanism implementation method, in which coordinated farmer groups produce a single crop type and combine their yields to achieve economies of scale. The farmer agents 2 ̆ 7 decisions to coordinate with one another depend on their evaluation of the tradeoff between their autonomy and the expected economic benefits of coordination. Each coordination decision is a bilateral process in which the terms of group reward sharing are negotiated. We capture the effects of farmers 2 ̆ 7 size, income, and autonomy premia, as well as volume-price relationships and group profit-sharing rules, on the rate of <b>farmer</b> <b>coordination</b> and the number and size of groups that form. Results indicate that under many conditions, coordination groups tend to consolidate over time, which suggests implications for overall supply chain structural resilience...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Tracing {{the genetic}} origin of central <b>European</b> <b>farmer</b> N 1 a {{lineages}} {{can provide a}} unique opportunity to assess the patterns of the farming technology spread into central Europe in the human prehistory. Here, we have chosen twelve N 1 a samples from modern populations which are most similar with the farmer N 1 a types and performed the complete mitochondrial DNA genome sequencing analysis. To assess the genetic and phylogeographic relationship, we performed a detailed survey of modern published N 1 a types from Eurasian and African populations. Results The geographic origin and expansion of farmer lineages related N 1 a subclades have been deduced from combined analysis of 19 complete sequences with 166 N 1 a haplotypes. The phylogeographic analysis revealed that the central <b>European</b> <b>farmer</b> lineages have originated from different sources: from eastern Europe, local central Europe, and from the Near East via southern Europe. Conclusions The results obtained emphasize that the arrival of central <b>European</b> <b>farmer</b> lineages did not occur via a single demic diffusion event from the Near East {{at the onset of the}} Neolithic spread of agriculture into Europe. Indeed these results indicate that the Neolithic transition process was more complex in central Europe and possibly the farmer N 1 a lineages were a result of a 'leapfrog' colonization process. </p...|$|R
25|$|Agriculture {{arrived in}} the Netherlands somewhere around 5000 BC with the Linear Pottery culture, who were {{probably}} central <b>European</b> <b>farmers.</b> Agriculture was practised only on the loess plateau in the very south (southern Limburg), but even there it was not established permanently.
