50|$|Motion picture {{prints are}} often contact printed either from an original, or a <b>duplicate</b> <b>negative.</b>|$|R
5000|$|All {{sources are}} {{assembled}} {{into a single}} master restoration element (most often a <b>duplicate</b> <b>negative).</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{fine grain}} master {{positive}} is a photographic term. It {{is also known as}} a {{fine grain master}} or fine grain and is a high-definition black-and-white intermediate positive image generated from a negative for the purpose of creating additional <b>duplicate</b> <b>negatives.</b> This intermediate element is exposed and chemically processed to a photographic gamma that will permit <b>duplicate</b> <b>negatives</b> as close to the original as is possible by a photochemical process.|$|R
5000|$|The new print {{was made}} “from the {{original}} 35mm nitrate picture negative, a 35mm safety <b>duplicate</b> <b>negative,</b> and a 35mm safety up-and-down track negative.” ...|$|R
50|$|Silver halide {{film is a}} slow {{version of}} camera film with a robust top coat. It is {{suitable}} for prints or for use as an intermediate from which further prints may be produced. The result is a negative copy. Preservation standards require a master <b>negative,</b> a <b>duplicate</b> <b>negative,</b> and a service copy (positive). Master negatives are kept in deep storage, and <b>duplicate</b> <b>negatives</b> are used to create service copies, which are the copies available to researchers. This multi-generational structure ensures {{the preservation of the}} master negative.|$|R
50|$|In {{traditional}} photochemical restorations, image polarity considerations must {{be observed}} when recombining surviving {{materials and the}} final, lowest generation restoration master may be either a <b>duplicate</b> <b>negative</b> or a fine grain master positive.|$|R
50|$|An {{internegative}} is {{a motion}} picture film duplicate. It {{is the color}} counterpart to an interpositive, in which a low-contrast color image is used as the positive between an original camera <b>negative</b> and a <b>duplicate</b> <b>negative.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2012, {{the film}} was {{preserved}} by the Academy Film Archive, using the original camera negative. A new fine grain master positive, new <b>duplicate</b> <b>negative</b> and new prints were created, as well as analog and digital soundtrack masters.|$|R
5000|$|Lavender Tint (variations: Purple Haze, Fleur de Lis) - Used in romantic, dusk or dawn, or oriental scenes primarily. Lavender tint {{was also}} used as a {{processing}} technique {{to cut down on}} contrast with <b>duplicate</b> <b>negatives</b> before fine grain positives were popular.|$|R
5000|$|Professor Mamlock {{opened in}} sixteen cinemas in Moscow, and was {{released}} in three hundred copies in the Soviet Union. Within the first eight days after its released, it had 370,000 admissions. Twenty-five copies were made for export to Europe, and a <b>duplicate</b> <b>negative</b> {{was sent to the}} United States to enable manufacturing new copies there.|$|R
40|$|Positive of the {{collodion}} wet-plate negative {{portrait of}} Abraham Lincoln taken 8 November 1863. This {{is one of}} the rare photographs of Lincoln looking directly at the viewer. It shows a haggard president with heavy lines on his face. His "lazy" left eye is noticeable. This positive image was made from the original Alexander Gardner negative by Indiana Historical Society photographer David Turk. He made the print from a <b>duplicate</b> <b>negative</b> (a negative of a transparency output from a digital scan of the original negative) ...|$|R
50|$|While a {{fine grain}} master appears {{over-exposed}} and dark, it contains {{all of the information}} in the original negative, compressed into the toe and straight-line portion of the H&D curve via exposure and chemical processing. The image is uncompressed when the <b>duplicate</b> <b>negative</b> is made from the element and the tonal range expanded up into the top straight-line and shoulder portion of the H&D curve.|$|R
50|$|The complete, uncut Animal Crackers, {{which had}} only been {{available}} for decades in a version cut for the 1936 reissue, was restored from a 35mm <b>duplicate</b> <b>negative</b> held by the British Film Institute and released by Universal Pictures in 2016 in DCP format for theatrical distribution and Blu-ray for home video as part of The Marx Brothers Silver Screen Collection. The restored edition features an optional commentary track by film historian Jeffrey Vance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{three year}} {{reconstruction}} {{was done by}} film historians David and Kimberly Shepard, with music scored by Gaylord Carter. [...] The source material was a 35mm <b>duplicate</b> <b>negative</b> from Czechoslovakia; the nitrate print had several defects {{that could not be}} taken out, was out of sequence and didn't have intertitles. [...] The intertitles were obtained from German censor records. [...] The film was tinted according to instructions by Fritz Lang, who was still living at the time.|$|R
40|$|Note translation: Negatives (some on film {{rather than}} glass) which are {{ascribed}} to Martin Göhring in our records. NB {{the people who}} have catalogued these negatives have formed the judgement that they are probably not the original negatives of photographs taken in Cameroon, but instead were a collelction of <b>duplicate</b> <b>negatives,</b> made in Basel for reasons we do not know. (PJ 08. 2002). NB there are many cases in which the negative image here is of a better quality than the paper print. (PJ 07. 2002) ...|$|R

5000|$|I {{could not}} find my Weston {{exposure}} meter! The situation was desperate: the low sun was trailing the edge of clouds in the west, and shadow would soon dim the white crosses ... I suddenly realized that I knew the luminance of the Moon — 250 cd/ft2. Using the Exposure Formula, I placed this value on Zone VII ... Realizing as I released the shutter that I had an unusual photograph which deserved a <b>duplicate</b> <b>negative,</b> I quickly reversed the film holder, but as I pulled the darkslide, the sunlight passed from the white crosses; I was a few seconds too late! The lone negative suddenly became precious.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the {{original}} negative was lost while being transferred from one film lab to another for preservation work. For {{a period of}} time the only existing copy was a 35mm print owned by Capra, until he made a <b>duplicate</b> <b>negative</b> from it and donated a newly minted print to the Library of Congress. Columbia later sold the rights to the story to United Artists for $200,000, and Capra remade the film as Pocketful of Miracles with Bette Davis and Glenn Ford in 1961. The director claimed to prefer the remake to the original, although most critics and, in later years film historians and movie buffs, disagreed with his assessment.|$|R
500|$|The {{colored lights}} in the Star Gate {{sequence}} were accomplished by slit-scan photography of thousands of high-contrast images on film, including Op art paintings, architectural drawings, Moiré patterns, printed circuits, and electron-microscope photographs of molecular and crystal structures. Known to staff as [...] "Manhattan Project", the shots of various nebula-like phenomena, including the expanding star field, were colored paints and chemicals swirling in a pool-like device known as a cloud tank, shot in slow-motion in a dark room. The live-action landscape shots in the 'Star Gate' sequence were filmed in the Hebridean islands, the mountains of northern Scotland, and Monument Valley. The coloring and negative-image effects were achieved {{by the use of}} different color filters in the process of making <b>duplicate</b> <b>negatives.</b>|$|R
40|$|Identity of creator is questionable.; Note translation: A small {{selection}} {{of a large number}} of glass-plate negatives (with four film negatives) ascribed in our records to Jakob Keller. Note that the four photographs of "Sister Käthi's bodyguard" are probably the same two photographs each represented by two negatives. This is an indication that negatives which we have in the archive may well be at least in part <b>duplicate</b> <b>negatives</b> made in Europe for reasons we do not know. (PJ 08. 2002). There is some inconsistency as some of the positives of these negatives are ascribed to Schkölziger (QE- 32. 010. 0123 - E- 30. 18. 036) and to Ittmann respectively (QE- 32. 010. 0507 and QE- 32. 010. 509 - E- 30. 18. 023).

50|$|In 1957, Universal Studios {{lost the}} rights to the {{original}} story, and a remake was released in 1963 directed by William Castle. For many years, the original version was considered a lost film and gained a tremendous {{reputation as one of the}} pre-eminent gothic horror films. Whale's fellow director and friend Curtis Harrington helped to prevent The Old Dark House from becoming a lost film. Harrington repeatedly asked Universal to locate the film negative, although it was Harrington who discovered a print of the film in the vaults of Universal Studios in 1968. He persuaded the George Eastman House film archive to finance a new <b>duplicate</b> <b>negative</b> of the poorly kept first reel, and restore the rest of the film.|$|R

50|$|Handschiegl {{described}} the invention thus: A separate, black-and-white print for each color {{to be applied}} was made. Using an opaque paint, portions of the image where color was to be applied were blocked out. A <b>duplicate</b> <b>negative</b> was made from the painted print and developed in a tanning developer, which hardened the gelatin layer {{where it had been}} exposed and developed. Those areas corresponding to the blocked out areas on the print remained relatively soft and capable of taking up dye. This dyed matrix film was brought into contact, in accurate register, with a positive print, to which the dye transferred in the appropriate areas. The print made several passes through the dye transfer machines, in contact with a separate matrix for each color. Usually, three colors were applied at the most.|$|R
5000|$|Originally the [...] "China Girl" [...] frames {{were created}} {{in-house}} by laboratories to varying standards, {{but in the}} mid-1970s engineers from the Eastman Kodak Company developed the Laboratory Aim Density system {{as a means of}} simplifying the production of motion picture prints. Under the LAD system, Kodak created many <b>duplicate</b> <b>negatives</b> of a single China Girl and provided them to laboratories to include in their standard leaders. These LAD frames were exposed to specific guidelines and allowed a laboratory technician to quickly make a subjective evaluation of a print's exposure and colour tone by looking at the China Girl herself. If a more objective evaluation were required, a densitometer could be used to compare the density of the colour patches in the LAD frame with Kodak's published guidelines.|$|R
50|$|Weber {{was one of}} the {{sponsors}} of a film made of a boxing match in Havana, Cuba, on 5 April 1915 between Jack Johnson and Jess Willard. He obtained the copyright on the film.He was refused permission to import it {{on the basis of a}} Federal law prohibiting import of such films for public exhibition.Weber argued that this law was not constitutional, since it infringed on the rights of states. The case was heard in the Supreme Court in December 1915, and decided against Weber.In 1916 Weber made a widely publicized attempt to bypass the restriction. He set up a motion picture camera 8 in south of the border between New York and Canada, pointing to a screen on the Canadian side on which each frame of the film of the 1915 Havana fight was projected, thus creating a <b>duplicate</b> <b>negative.</b> He lost the court case that followed on the basis that he had violated the spirit of the law.|$|R
50|$|Visconti {{adapted the}} script {{with a group}} of men he {{selected}} from the Milanese magazine Cinema. The members of this group were talented filmmakers and writers and played a large role in the emerging neorealist movement: Mario Alicata, Gianni Puccini, Antonio Pietrangeli and Giuseppe De Santis. When Ossessione was completed and released in 1943, it was far from the innocent murder mystery the authorities had expected; after a few screenings in Rome and northern Italy, prompting outraged reactions from Fascist and Church authorities, the film was banned by the Fascist government reestablished in the German occupied part of Italy after the September 1943 armistice. Eventually the Fascists destroyed the film, but Visconti managed to keep a <b>duplicate</b> <b>negative</b> from which all existing prints have been made. After the war, Ossessione encountered more problems with mass distribution, this time in the United States. As a result of the wartime production schedule, Visconti had never obtained the rights to the novel and Metro-Goldwyn Mayer began production on another version of the film, directed by Tay Garnett (The Postman Always Rings Twice, 1946), while the Fascist ban on Visconti’s work was still in effect.|$|R
50|$|They {{prepared}} and labeled insects that were included into the collection. For that service they received <b>duplicate</b> specimens. <b>Negative</b> {{aspects of this}} practice very soon became apparent. Some amateurs took advantage of Menetries’ reliance. A particularly negative role was played by V.I. Motschulsky starting in the mid-1850s. This very energetic man, colonel of the General Staff, owner of a huge collection and author of numerous works on systematics of beetles and some on other insects suggested that he would identify and bring into order the Coleoptera collection.|$|R
5|$|In 2013, {{the video}} {{distribution}} company The Criterion Collection, {{in collaboration with}} the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ Film Archive, began the restoration of the original negatives of the Apu trilogy, including Pather Panchali. These negatives had been severely damaged by a fire in London in 1993, and all film cans and fragments belonging to the Ray films were sent to the Motion Picture Academy for storage, where they lay unseen for two decades. It was discovered upon reexamination that, although many parts of the films were indeed destroyed by fire or the effects of age, other parts were salvageable. The materials were shipped to a restoration laboratory in Bologna, Italy: L’Immagine Ritrovata. Over a thousand hours of labor by hand were expended in restoring and scanning the negatives and, in the end, about 40 percent of the Pather Panchali negative was restored. (For those parts of the negative that were missing or unusable, <b>duplicate</b> <b>negatives</b> and fine-grain masters from various commercial or archival sources were used.) The Criterion Collection’s own lab then spent six months creating the digital version of all three films, at times choosing to preserve the distinctive look of the films even at the cost of retaining some imperfections.|$|R
25|$|Later that year, Méliès {{made the}} féerie Cinderella, based on Charles Perrault's fairy tale. The film was six minutes long {{and had a}} cast of over 35 people, {{including}} Bleuette Bernon in the title role. It was also Méliès' first film with multiple scenes, known as tableaux. The film was very successful across Europe and in the United States, playing mostly in fairgrounds and music halls. American film distributors such as Siegmund Lubin were especially in need of new material both to attract their audience with new films and to counter Edison's growing monopoly. Méliès' films were particularly popular, and Cinderella was often screened as a featured attraction even years after its U.S. release in December 1899. Such U.S. filmmakers as Thomas Edison were resentful of the competition from foreign companies and after the success of Cinderella, attempted to block Méliès from screening most films in the U.S.; but they soon discovered {{the process of creating}} film dupes (<b>duplicate</b> <b>negatives).</b> Méliès and others then established the trade union Chambre Syndicale des Editeurs Cinématographiques as a way to defend themselves in foreign markets. Méliès was made the first president of the union, serving until 1912, and the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was the group's headquarters.|$|R

5000|$|During the film's {{original}} theatrical release, {{the original}} negatives were worn down {{due to the}} reel being printed so much to meet demand. In addition, the <b>duplicate</b> <b>negative</b> was lost in Paramount archives. In 2006 Coppola contacted Steven Spielberg—whose studio DreamWorks had recently been bought out by Paramount—about restoring The Godfather. Robert A. Harris was hired to oversee the restoration of The Godfather and its two sequels, with the film's cinematographer Willis participating in the restoration. Work began in November 2008 by repairing the negatives so they could go through a digital scanner to produce high resolution 4K files. If a negative were damaged and discolored, work was done digitally to restore it to its original look. After {{a year and a}} half of working on the restoration, the project was complete. Paramount called the finished product The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration and released it to the public on September 23, 2008, on both DVD and Blu-ray Disc. Dave Kehr of The New York Times believed the restoration brought back the [...] "golden glow of their original theatrical screenings". As a whole, the restoration of the film was well received by critics and Coppola. The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration contains several new special features that play in high definition, along with additional scenes.|$|R
