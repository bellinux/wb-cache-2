5|$|During {{the early}} 1930s Butlin joined {{the board of}} Harry Warner's holiday camp company (now Warner Leisure Hotels) and in 1935 he {{observed}} the construction of Warner's holiday camp in Seaton, Devon. Butlin learned {{from the experience of}} Warner, and employed the workers who <b>had</b> <b>constructed</b> the Seaton camp to come to Lincolnshire to build his new camp at Skegness.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the Government {{decided that}} a further {{generation}} of new towns in South East England was needed to take the projected population increase of London, after the initial 1940s/1950s wave. Bletchley had already been considered as a new town in this first wave, and in the 1950s the London County Council <b>had</b> <b>constructed</b> overspill housing for several London boroughs there.|$|E
5|$|On 26 January, a {{combined}} U.S. Army and Marine unit called the Composite Army-Marine (CAM) Division advancing westward encountered the Yano Battalion at the Marmura River. Yano's troops temporarily halted the CAM's advance {{and then slowly}} withdrew westward {{over the next three}} days. On 29 January, the Yano retreated across the Bonegi River, where soldiers from the 2nd Division <b>had</b> <b>constructed</b> another defensive position.|$|E

5|$|U.S. Marines, {{under the}} overall command of U.S. Major General Alexander Vandegrift, {{captured}} {{the islands of}} Tulagi, Gavutu, and Tanambogo among which the Japanese Navy <b>had</b> <b>constructed</b> a naval and seaplane base. The landings were fiercely resisted by the Japanese Navy troops who, outnumbered and outgunned by the Allied forces, fought and died almost to the last man.|$|E
5|$|A castle {{here could}} guard {{several of the}} main {{strategic}} routes and form part {{of a network of}} strongholds of the Norman kingdom, in the former Danish Mercia, roughly the area today referred to as the East Midlands, to control the country internally. Also it was a centre from which troops could be sent to repel Scandinavian landings anywhere on the coast from the Trent to the Welland, to a large extent, by using the roads which the Romans <b>had</b> <b>constructed</b> for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Darius {{sponsored}} large {{construction projects}} in Susa, Babylon, Egypt, and Persepolis. In Susa, Darius {{built a new}} palace complex {{in the north of}} the city. An inscription states that the palace was destroyed during the reign of Artaxerxes I, but was rebuilt. Today only glazed bricks of the palace remain, the majority of them in the Louvre. In Pasargadae Darius finished all incomplete construction projects from the reign of Cyrus the Great. A palace was also built during the reign of Darius, with an inscription in the name of Cyrus the Great. It was previously believed that Cyrus <b>had</b> <b>constructed</b> this building, however due to the cuneiform script being used, the palace {{is believed to have been}} constructed by Darius.|$|E

5|$|At around 04:00 on 5 July, the German attack {{commenced}} with {{a preliminary}} bombardment. Manstein's main attack was delivered by Hoth's 4th Panzer Army, which was organized into densely concentrated spearheads. Opposing the 4th Panzer Army was the Soviet 6th Guards Army, which {{was composed of}} the 22nd Guards Rifle Corps and 23rd Guards Rifle Corps. The Soviets <b>had</b> <b>constructed</b> three heavily fortified defensive belts to slow and weaken the attacking armoured forces. Though they had been provided superb intelligence, the Voronezh Front headquarters had still {{not been able to}} pinpoint the exact location where the Germans would place their offensive weight.|$|E
5|$|In {{producing}} the series, Maiellaro crudely designed the characters as a cost-cutting measure; {{the series is}} animated by Radical Axis. He intended for the series to lack continuity starting from the pilot, but established a serial format after starting the second episode. He <b>had</b> <b>constructed</b> an ending for the series {{as well as a}} detailed map of characters; however, the series finale concluded differently from planned. Maiellaro cast people around his office for the characters, starring himself as the protagonist and Nine Pound Hammer vocalist Scott Luallen as the voice of Roostre; the band also performs the opening theme.|$|E
5|$|Lewis {{argues that}} Applewhite {{effectively}} controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms. Richard Hecht of the University of California, Santa Barbara, echoes this sentiment, arguing {{that members of}} the group killed themselves because they believed the narrative that he <b>had</b> <b>constructed,</b> rather than because he psychologically controlled them. In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to commit suicide because they saw {{it as a way to}} demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite.|$|E

5|$|Plantations {{continued}} to develop along {{the fringes of}} present-day West Virginia. By {{the close of the}} 18th century, Harman Blennerhassett <b>had</b> <b>constructed</b> a mansion on his plantation on Blennerhassett Island and Moses Shepherd had built Shepherd Hall near Wheeling, both in the Ohio River valley. Despite the agricultural development of then western Virginia's bottomlands and the resulting wealth of the plantation owners, the hinterlands of the Allegheny Mountains and Allegheny Plateau regions remained underpopulated and inhabited by subsistence farmers of meager means {{into the middle of the}} 19th century. By the 1860 United States Census, Berkeley, Greenbrier, Hampshire, Hardy, Jefferson, Kanawha, and Monroe counties consequently had the largest populations of slaves in present-day West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Russell repeats {{his opening}} monologue, {{but with the}} revelation {{that he is in}} fact hiding behind a fake wall the robbers <b>had</b> <b>constructed</b> inside the bank's supply room. He emerges a week after the robbery with the {{contents}} of Case's safe deposit box, including incriminating documents and several bags of diamonds. On his way out, he bumps into Frazier, who does not recognize him. When Frazier opens the safe deposit box, he finds the ring and a note from Russell. Frazier confronts Case and urges White to contact the Office of War Crimes Issues at the State Department about Case's war crimes. At home, Frazier finds a loose diamond, slipped into his pocket by Russell.|$|E
5|$|South of Moose on the Mooseâ€“Wilson Road, the Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve Center {{is located}} on land that was privately owned by Laurance S. Rockefeller and is {{situated}} on Phelps Lake. Donated to Grand Teton National Park and {{opened to the public}} in 2008, the property was once part of the JY Ranch, the first dude ranch in Jackson Hole. At Jenny Lake, the Jenny Lake Visitor Center is open from mid-May to mid-September. This visitor center is within the Jenny Lake Ranger Station Historic District and is the same structure photographer Harrison Crandall <b>had</b> <b>constructed</b> as an art studio in the 1920s.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, Hospital Information System (HIS) {{has been}} {{developed}} in several areas. Many hospitals <b>have</b> <b>constructed</b> HIS. According to the Ministry of Health in 2004, there were 6,063 hospitals out of 15,924 that had established hospital information systems. It is estimated that about 70% of county-level hospitals and above <b>have</b> <b>constructed</b> HIS by mid-2007.|$|R

5|$|The 51st Transport Regiment <b>had</b> <b>constructed</b> an {{airstrip}} on Lorengau and commenced another, {{known as}} Momote Airstrip, at the Momote Plantation on Los Negros. Lorengau {{was used as}} a staging point for aircraft moving between Rabaul and airstrips in North East New Guinea. The importance of the Admiralty Islands to the Japanese increased as the result of Allied advances in New Guinea and New Britain which blocked off other air routes. By February, both airstrips were unserviceable and the antiaircraft guns were silent in order to conserve ammunition and conceal their positions. Ezaki had ordered his men to neither move nor fire in daylight.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} of the Montana-class battleships {{would have}} been similar to the preceding Iowa-class battleships, but {{with an increase in}} the number of primary guns and more potent secondary guns for use against enemy surface ships and aircraft. Had they been completed, the Montanas {{would have been}} gun-for-gun the most powerful battleships the United States <b>had</b> <b>constructed,</b> and the only US battleship class that would have come close to equaling the Imperial Japanese Navy battleships Yamato and Musashi in armament, armor, and displacement.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{aspect of the}} book was Wright's method for dividing the meridian; an explanation of how he <b>had</b> <b>constructed</b> a table for the division; and the uses of this information for navigation. Essentially, the problem that occupied Wright was how to depict accurately a globe on a two-dimensional map according to the projection used by Gerardus Mercator in his map of 1569. Mercator's projection was advantageous for nautical purposes as it represented lines of constant true bearing or true course, known as loxodromes or rhumb lines, as straight lines. However, Mercator had not explained his method.|$|E

5|$|Tolkien {{at first}} {{intended}} The Lord of the Rings to be a children's tale {{in the style}} of The Hobbit, but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing. Though a direct sequel to The Hobbit, it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense backstory of Beleriand that Tolkien <b>had</b> <b>constructed</b> in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in The Silmarillion and other volumes. Tolkien's influence weighs heavily on the fantasy genre that grew up after the success of The Lord of the Rings.|$|E
5|$|Ã†thelbert retired {{some time}} before his death, consecrating Eanbald as his successor. The exact date this {{occurred}} is unclear. Alcuin gives a date corresponding to July 778, {{but it could be}} 777 too. Eanbald's position may have just been as an associate bishop, with Ã†thelbert remaining in office until his death while sharing the office with Eanbald. During his retirement, he <b>had</b> <b>constructed</b> a new church dedicated to Alma Sophia. He lived long enough to consecrate the new church, ten days before his death on 8 November.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century the suburbs of the left bank were the quickest growing areas of Rouen, in {{particular}} the communes of Sotteville (a large railway town) and Grand-Quevilly, but these towns did not have good enough public transport. Although the CTR <b>had</b> <b>constructed</b> some lines, they did not well serve residents wishing for rapid transit between the suburbs and the city centre. Line 4 of the CTR, with its central terminus at Place Beauvoisine, ran only as far as the Trianon roundabout {{at the edge of the}} Jardin des Plantes. A southern extension was planned to the BruyÃ¨res roundabout, a meeting-point of several roads to the new districts, and to the racecourse where major horse racing events took place each Thursday. But it was always delayed.|$|E
