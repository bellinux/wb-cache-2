25|$|Many machine models {{different}} from the standard multi-tape Turing machines have been proposed in the literature, for example random access machines. Perhaps surprisingly, each of these models {{can be converted to}} another without providing any extra computational power. The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary.

25|$|What tribunals all <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{they are}} created by statute, their adjudicators are usually {{appointed}} by government, and they focus on very particular and specialized areas of law.

There are both federal and provincial tribunals for some subject matters such as unionized labour and human rights.|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1797, Coleridge {{was fascinated}} {{with the idea of}} a river and it was used in {{multiple}} poems including [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] and [...] "The Brook". In his Biographia Literaria (1817), he explained, [...] "I sought for a subject, that should give equal room and freedom for description, incident, and impassioned reflections on men, nature, and society, yet supply in itself a natural connection to the parts and unity to the whole. Such a subject I conceived myself to have found in a stream, traced from its source in the hills among the yellow-red moss and conical glass-shaped tufts of bent, to the first break or fall, where its drops become audible, and it begins to form a channel". It is possible that the imagery of Biographia Literaria followed the recovery of the [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] manuscript during the composition of the book. Water imagery permeated through many of his poems, and the coast that he witnessed on his journey to Linton appears in Osorio. Additionally, many of the images are connected to a broad use of Ash Farm and the Quantocks in Coleridge's poetry, and the mystical settings of both Osorio and [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] are based on his idealised version of the region. [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] was composed in the same year as This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison, and both poems contained images that were used in the 14 October 1797 letter to Thelwall. However, the styles are very different as one is heavily structured and rhymed while the other tries to mimic conversational speech. What they do <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they use scenery based on the same location, including repeated uses of dells, rocks, ferns, and a waterfall found in the Somerset region. The Preface uses water imagery to explain what happens when visions are lost by quoting a passage from his poem The Picture. When considering all of The Picture and not just the excerpt, Coleridge describes how inspiration is similar to a stream and that if an object is thrown into it the vision is interrupted.|$|E
6000|$|Coal, as {{of course}} you know, is {{commonly}} said to be composed of vegetable matter, of the leaves and stems of ancient plants and trees--a startling statement, and one which I do not wish you to take entirely on trust. I shall therefore spend a few pages in showing you how this fact--for fact it is--was discovered. It {{is a very good}} example of reasoning from the known to the unknown. You will have a right to say at first starting, [...] "Coal is utterly different in look from leaves and stems. The only property which they seem to <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they can both burn." [...] True. But difference of mere look may be only owing to a transformation, or series of transformations. There are plenty in nature quite as great, and greater. What can be more different in look, for instance, than a green field of wheat and a basket of loaves at the baker's? And yet there is, I trust, no doubt whatsoever that the bread has been once green wheat, and that the green wheat has been transformed into bread--making due allowance, of course, for the bone-dust, or gypsum, or alum with which the worthy baker may have found it profitable to adulterate his bread, in order to improve the digestion of Her Majesty's subjects.|$|E
