500|$|On July 6, 1902, Flick hit three triples in one game. Between 1900 and 2010, 49 players {{accomplished}} that feat. By early 1904, Flick did {{not want}} to re-sign with Cleveland for the offered $2,500 ($ in current dollar terms). Plans were being made to run a railroad through a corner of Flick's farm and Flick hoped to hire some of his horses to the construction team.

In episode 13 of the Dutch TV series Of Beauty and Consolation Gould remarked, [...] "In {{a couple of years}} <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to gather in one volume my view of how evolution works. It is to me a great consolation because it represents the putting together of a lifetime of thinking into one source. That book will never be particularly widely read. It's going to be far too long, and it's only for a few thousand professionals—very different from my popular science writings—but it is of greater consolation to me because it is a chance to put into one place a whole way of thinking about evolution that I've struggled with all my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sven Anders Hedin, {{a medical}} doctor at the royal court, and married {{to one of the}} Queen's chambermaids, Charlotta Hellman, contributed two {{statements}} which have been quoted in connection with the scandal. In the summer of 1780, during the King's absence abroad, he passed through the private apartments of the Queen, which were expected to be empty at that hour. There, he claimed to have seen the Queen and Baron Munck embracing each other through the not-quite closed door to her bedroom. [...] To warn them that they were not alone, he hummed a tune and pretended to speak to himself, saying that he would be in trouble if the Queen discovered him there, and then left the room. He claimed to have found three expensive court costumes in his room a few days after this event. In October 1781, Hedin met the King in the corridor {{on his way to the}} Queen's bed chamber. Gustav III asked Hedin what time it was, and Hedin claims to have added to his reply: [...] "In nine months, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to answer exactly!" [...] in which Hedin insinuated that the King had expected him to remember the time should the fatherhood of the next child be questioned.|$|E

[...] On 15 May, a state of emergency was declared and Parliament was suspended in favour of the National Operations Council (NOC), a body of top government officials. That day, Ismail announced to the media that [...] "Democracy is dead in this country. It died {{at the hands of the}} opposition parties who triggered off the event leading to this violence." [...] Privately, Ismail accused the opposition parties of playing [...] "communal politics", by using the Islamic party, PAS, to appeal to the extremist Malays, and using the ostensibly multiracial parties such as the Democratic Action Party and Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia to appeal to the extremist Chinese. [...] "Since the Alliance's policy is based on compromise," [...] he said, [...] "it could not therefore please all the Malays or all the Chinese but could only please the moderate Malays and the understanding Chinese." [...] Ismail blamed the MCA as well, telling a friend that [...] "it was with this tension, with this irresponsible decision by the MCA that the riot started".|$|E
