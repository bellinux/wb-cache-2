5|$|As the German commanders on {{the spot}} had warned Hitler in vain, there was little chance of the attack succeeding, and the {{concentration}} of their armoured reserves at {{the western end of}} the front in Normandy soon led to disaster, as they were outflanked to their south and the front to their east collapsed, resulting <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German troops in Normandy being trapped in the Falaise Pocket.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its natural}} {{strategic}} {{position on a}} small peninsula into the Mediterranean Sea below the Taurus Mountains, Alanya has been a local stronghold for many Mediterranean-based empires, including the Ptolemaic, Seleucid, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman Empires.

All filter classes used in lumped element designs (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) can be implemented using a distributed element approach.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> works, {{including}} the original series, Warhol drastically simplified the gold medallion that appears on Campbell's Soup cans by replacing the paired allegorical figures {{with a flat}} yellow disk.

The works with torn labels are perceived as metaphors {{of life in the}} sense that even packaged food must meet its end. They are often described as expressionistic.|$|E
