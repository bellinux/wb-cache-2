5|$|Grace's (Debra Messing) {{pregnancy}} prompts Karen (Megan Mullally) {{to have a}} baby of her own. She pays a surrogate, Cricket (Wanda Sykes), {{to carry}} her child. Grace, who is bewildered at the idea of Karen having a baby, suspects that the only reason is that she is having one. Karen, however, dismisses the idea. Meanwhile, Cricket begins to have second thoughts on becoming Karen's surrogate, following Karen's strange behavior towards her and Karen's admission on how she and her husband, Stanley, will raise the child. This prompts Cricket to quit and Karen revealing to Grace that the only reason she wanted a baby was to help her marriage. She also admits that she <b>has</b> <b>thought</b> about leaving her husband.|$|E
25|$|This {{segmentation}} {{may result}} from deliberate policy. Segmentation and positioning are powerful marketing techniques, but the trade-off—against better focus—is that market segments may effectively be put beyond reach. On the other hand, product gap can occur by default; the organization <b>has</b> <b>thought</b> out its positioning, its offerings drifted to a particular market segment.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspension}} and the partly concomitant Thanksgiving break give the girls {{time to become}} closer and lead to their first kiss. Annie admits that she <b>has</b> <b>thought</b> that she may be gay. Liza soon realizes that although she has always considered herself different, she has not considered her sexual orientation until {{falling in love with}} Annie.|$|E

25|$|Another {{controversy}} was MCC's {{decision to}} allow members and other spectators to continue to bring limited amounts of alcoholic drinks into the ground at all matches. This decision challenged the ICC, which was attempting to implement a ban on this practice at all international matches around the world. MCC has opted to write to the ICC {{on an annual basis}} to seek permission for members and spectators to import alcohol into Lord's. No other Ground Authority <b>has</b> <b>thought</b> it necessary to seek permission from the ICC for their members and spectators to import alcohol into their cricket ground, there being money to be made out of selling alcohol themselves.|$|E
25|$|The Culture has {{achieved}} artificial intelligences where each Mind <b>has</b> <b>thought</b> processing capabilities many {{orders of magnitude}} beyond that of human beings, and data storage drives which, if written out on paper and stored in filing cabinets, would cover thousands of planets skyscraper high (as described by one Mind in Consider Phlebas). Yet it has managed to condense these entities to a volume of several dozen cubic metres (though much of the contents and the operating structure are continually in hyperspace). Minds also demonstrate reaction times and multitasking abilities orders of magnitude greater than any sentient being; armed engagements between Culture and equivalent technological civilizations sometimes occur in timeframes as short as microseconds, and standard Orbital Minds are capable of running all of the vital systems on the Orbital while simultaneously conversing with millions of the inhabitants and observing phenomena in the surrounding regions of space.|$|E

25|$|The {{elements}} {{found in}} consciousness are {{also to be}} found in the history of humanity and in the history of philosophy. In external nature there are expansion and contraction which correspond to spontaneity and reflection. External nature again in contrast with humanity expresses spontaneity; humanity expresses reflection. In human history the East represents the spontaneous stage; the Pagan and Christian world represent stages of reflection. This was afterwards modified, expanded and more fully expressed by saying that humanity in its universal development has three principal moments. First, in the spontaneous stage, where reflection is not yet developed, and art is imperfect, humanity <b>has</b> <b>thought</b> only of the immensity around it. It is preoccupied by the infinite. Secondly, in the reflective stage, mind has become an object to itself. It thus knows itself explicitly or reflectively. Its own individuality is now the only or at least the supreme thing. This is the moment of the finite. Thirdly, there comes an epoch in which the self or me is subordinated. Mind realizes another power in the universe. The finite and the infinite become two real correlatives in the relation of cause and product. This is the third and highest stage of development, the relation of the finite and the infinite. As philosophy is but the highest expression of humanity, these three moments will be represented in its history. The East typifies the infinite, Greece the finite or reflective epoch, the modern era the stage of relation or correlation of infinite and finite. In theology, the dominant philosophical idea of each of these epochs results in pantheism, polytheism, theism. In politics we have a correspondence also with the ideas of monarchy, democracy, and constitutional polity.|$|E
500|$|Hopps, who had {{previously}} written for animated series such as Buzz Lightyear of Star Command, Justice League, and Darkwing Duck, researched for the episode by re-reading every available comic book that featured Green Goblin. Hopps notes that [...] "you might consider him [...] crazed, but he's truly brilliant and <b>has</b> <b>thought</b> things out far in advance. He's always several steps ahead of where you think he is. So while I'm writing Goblin, I'm always trying {{to keep in mind}} where he's going next." [...] While penning the fight sequence between Goblin and Spider-Man, Hopps paid close attention to brawls detailed in [...] "Catalysts" [...] in order to better grasp [...] "how we could make it different and really up the stakes." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{hopes of}} winning over the opposition, Hitler {{arranged}} meetings in Munich {{with the three}} Greater Ruhr Gau leaders, including Goebbels. Goebbels was impressed when Hitler sent his own car to meet them at the railway station. That evening Hitler and Goebbels both gave speeches at a beer hall rally. The following day, Hitler offered his hand in reconciliation to the three men, encouraging them to put their differences behind them. Goebbels capitulated completely, offering Hitler his total loyalty. He wrote in his diary: [...] "I love him... He <b>has</b> <b>thought</b> through everything," [...] "Such a sparkling mind can be my leader. I bow to the greater one, the political genius." [...] He later wrote: [...] "Adolf Hitler, I love you because you are both great and simple at the same time. What one calls a genius." [...] As {{a result of the}} Bamberg and Munich meetings, Strasser's new draft of the party programme was discarded. The original National Socialist Program of 1920 was retained unchanged, and Hitler's position as party leader was greatly strengthened.|$|E

500|$|Besides word {{of mouth}} and {{opinions}} in letters, {{there were only a}} few published contemporary reviews. The writer and journalist John Stoddart (1773–1856), in a review of Lyrical Ballads, described [...] "Strange fits" [...] and [...] "She dwelt" [...] as [...] "the most singular specimens of unpretending, yet irresistible pathos". An anonymous review of Poems in Two Volumes in 1807 had a less positive opinion about [...] "I travell'd": [...] "Another string of flat lines about Lucy is succeeded by an ode to Duty". Critic Francis Jeffrey (1773–1850) claimed that, in [...] "Strange fits", [...] "Mr Wordsworth, however, <b>has</b> <b>thought</b> fit to compose a piece, illustrating this copious subject by one single thought. A lover trots away to see his mistress one fine evening, staring all the way at the moon: when he comes to her door, 'O mercy! to myself I cried, / If Lucy should be dead!' And there the poem ends!" [...] On [...] "A slumber did my spirit seal", Wordsworth's friend Thomas Powell wrote that the poem [...] "stands by itself, and is without title prefixed, yet we are to know, from the penetration of Mr. Wordsworth's admirers, that it is a sequel to the other deep poems that precede it, and is about one Lucy, who is dead. From the table of contents, however, we are informed by the author that it is about 'A Slumber;' for this is the actual title which he has condescended to give it, to put us out of pain as to what it is about." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{feasibility}} of Drexler's proposals largely depends, therefore, on whether designs {{like those in}} Nanosystems could be built {{in the absence of}} a universal assembler to build them and would work as described.
