40|$|This study {{documents}} the wide deviation of securitized real <b>estate</b> assets <b>in</b> <b>equity</b> REITs from {{the value of}} the underlying commercial properties. A procedure for estimating the net asset value of REITs is developed and the estimates are used to investigate the sources of premiums/discounts from net asset value in a large sample of equity REITs. To avoid measurement error bias, two-way analysis of variance is used to test for differences among size and property-type categories. The results indicate that retail REITs trade at significant premiums relative to the average REIT while warehouse/industrial REITs trade at discounts and small REITs trade at significant discounts while large REITs trade at premiums. The discounts and premiums from net asset value do not translate into higher cash flow yields. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{assess and}} analyze the three {{components}} of active management (asset allocation, market timing and security selection) {{in the performance of}} pension funds. Security selection explains most of the differences in pension fund returns. Large pension funds in our sample on average provide value to their clients after accounting for all investment-related costs, both before and after risk-adjusting: we find an annual alpha of 17 basis points from changes in asset allocation, 27 basis points from market timing, and 45 basis points from security selection. All three active management components exhibit significant liquidity limitations, which are important in all asset classes, including equity and fixed income. Security selection outperformance is largely driven by momentum trading. Accounting for momentum reduces the security selection alpha by about 72 basis points and offsets most of the positive risk-adjusted returns from market timing and asset allocation changes. Larger funds realize economies of scale in their relatively small allocation to private asset classes, like private equity and real <b>estate.</b> However, <b>in</b> <b>equity</b> and fixed income markets they experience substantial liquidity-related diseconomies of scale...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{economic indicators}} {{to show how}} the role of the real <b>estate</b> industry <b>in</b> the economy has evolved over time. This examination spans the early 1980 s through 1999. Our key conclusion includes the followings. In terms of economic flows real estate is as important a part of the economy as ever. About 11 % of GDP each year is attributable to the real estate industry. Some parts of the industry, especially those finance and capital market related, have increased share in GDP, while others (services) have remained constant or even shrunk. In a stock measure, household and corporation asset allocations have shown significantly lower shares for real estate. The strong performance of the stock market, growth in household wealth combined with a relatively low income elasticity of demand for housing, and changed corporate behavior appear to have contributed to this decline. The values of real <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> debt and <b>equity</b> markets have increased substantially. Securitizations of mortgage and commercial mortgage have made real estate an increasingly important component in debt market. The prominence of real estate investment trusts (REITs) in the stock market has increased since 1985. However it remains a very small fraction of the overall equity market. ...|$|R
