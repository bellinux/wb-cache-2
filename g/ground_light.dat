500|$|Ground {{camouflage}} is used {{to delay}} visual acquisition from the air of an aircraft that is {{on or near the}} <b>ground.</b> <b>Light</b> sand has been used for aircraft used over deserts, blues and greys for aircraft over the sea, and greens and browns for aircraft that are expected to operate in forested areas. However, a camouflaged aircraft either on the ground or flying low over the ground in bright sunlight remains vulnerable to being detected from above because of its own shadow cast on the ground.> This can reduce an aircraft's camouflage effectiveness at altitudes up to , particularly if the ground surface is pale and relatively uniform. Helicopters are often painted in ground camouflage, sometimes in regional or seasonal forms such as snow camouflage.

40|$|Single phase {{thyristor}} rectifiers {{are widely}} used in modern airport as dc power supply for such loads as air-conditioners, communication, computers and airport <b>grounding</b> <b>lighting</b> system(AGL). The disadvantages {{of this kind of}} rectifiers are the waveform distortion and the unbalance of loading, both of which have become a concern at many airports. In this paper, the harmonics produced by clusters of phase controlled rectifiers of airport <b>grounding</b> <b>lighting</b> system are studied based on experimental measurement. It is shown these rectifiers are the dominant harmonics source of the airport electrical power system. Harmonic pollution is found to be closely related to the load level of airport <b>grounding</b> <b>lighting</b> system. Voltage waveform distortion at point of common coupling (PCC) is primarily a result of harmonic current generated by the power electronics controlled loads. It is also found total voltage harmonics distortion does not necessarily increase with the increase of current distortion at PCC. The harmonics and unbalance for combined loads are also investigated in this paper. Severe unbalance is observed which is disadvantageous for the power transformer and the auxiliary generator. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5000|$|The autokinetic {{illusion}} occurs {{at night or}} in conditions with poor visual cues. This illusion gives the pilot the impression that a stationary object is moving {{in front of the}} airplane's path; it is caused by staring at a fixed single point of light (<b>ground</b> <b>light</b> or a star) in a totally dark and featureless background. The reason why this visual illusion occurs is because of very small movements of the eyes. In conditions with poor visual cues accompanied by a single source of light, these eye movements are interpreted by the brain as movement of the object being viewed. [...] This illusion can cause a misperception that such a light is {{on a collision course with}} the aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{originally}} {{developed for the}} experimental but never produced MBT-70 tank and served most notably as a primary weapon of the M551 Sheridan light tank, but the missile system was not issued to units serving in Vietnam and was retired in 1996. It was also used on the M60A2 [...] "Starship" [...] which was phased out by 1981. Ultimately {{very few of the}} 88,000 rounds produced were ever fired in combat, and the system has largely been succeeded as a US anti-tank missile by the later BGM-71 TOW wire-guided missile first produced in 1970. As wire guidance and tube launcher {{has proved to be a}} simpler, TOW has seen combat fitted to 15,000 <b>ground,</b> <b>light</b> and armored vehicle and helicopter platforms of 40 international armed forces. Main battle tanks of the late 20th and 21st fielded improved conventional 100 to 125 mm guns and ammunition which proved effective against enemy armor threats. While Soviets designers have developed gun launched missiles, the US and NATO were developing guided tank shells.|$|E
50|$|The SWIR {{spectrometer}} {{was designed}} and built by the Optical Payloads Group of Surrey Satellites (SSTL); it employs an immersed grating design in which light impinges upon an etched grating from within a high-index substrate (silicon in this case). The reduced wavelength within the refractive medium permits an efficient, space-saving design. The SWIR grating was provided by SRON (Netherlands), who also provided the Front-End Electronics (FEE). The SWIR spectrometer receives light from the main instrument via an intermediate pupil, and directs this - via a telescope - towards a slit which defines the along-track footprint of the instrument on the <b>ground.</b> <b>Light</b> from the slit is re-collimated, diffracted by the immersed-grating at high-order and finally imaged onto a two-dimensional detector by a high aperture relay lens. The SWIR detector (furnished by Sofradir, France) has 256 elements in the across-track direction and 1024 elements in the spectral direction (the element pitch is 30 microns); it is operated cold (typically 140 K). The SWIR spectrometer optics are mounted on a cooled optical bench (approximately 200K) and the instrument is insulated by a multiple-layer insulation (MLI) blanket. The SWIR instrument was aligned, focussed and characterised at the Mullard Space Science laboratory thermal vacuum facility in Surrey, UK.|$|E

30|$|Even though {{driving into}} sidings/the depot is a {{frequent}} task for drivers working shifts around rush hours, it {{does not account for}} a significant percentage of their shift. Hence, when the large percentage of all category A SPaDs and the low percentage of the shift spent in these locations are considered, this suggests that there are issues {{in the design of the}} locations and operational procedures. The signalling is the main difference at the depot and the sidings compared to the rest of the network with the majority of the signals being <b>ground</b> position <b>lights.</b> Even though the majority of the drivers disagree with added complexity of those locations and <b>ground</b> position <b>lights,</b> they gave this type of signals the lowest mark. Moreover, participants’ involvement in category A SPaDs does not influence the attitudes of the drivers towards the <b>ground</b> position <b>lights</b> (U =  28, p =  0.663).

However, when compared with different types of signals, they perceive the <b>ground</b> position <b>lights</b> as the hardest to interact with. It is also possible that the <b>ground</b> position <b>lights</b> are the hardest to interact with in the beginning of a shift before driving in passenger service.|$|R
