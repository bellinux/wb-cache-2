5|$|Peter Sellers, CBE (born Richard Henry Sellers; 8 September 1925– 24 July 1980) was an English film actor, comedian and singer. He {{performed}} in the BBC Radio comedy series The Goon Show, featured {{on a number of}} hit comic songs and became known to a worldwide audience through his many film characterisations, among them Chief Inspector Clouseau <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Pink</b> Panther series of films.|$|E
5|$|UNPROFOR and the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) {{requested}} the HV to withdraw to positions held before the offensive, but the HV declined the request. However, Croatia agreed that UNPROFOR and ECMM monitors {{would continue to}} be present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> zones when Croatia assumed control over them. The move was planned as a way to reassure the Serb population that the pink zones could provide them safety. In the aftermath of the offensive, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) adopted the UNSC Resolution 762, urging cessation of hostilities in or near the UNPAs, and urging the HV to pull back to positions held before 21 June. The 113th Brigade of the HV remained at the plateau regardless. The resolution authorised the UNPROFOR to perform monitoring of the pink zones. It also recommended establishment of a joint commission chaired by an UNPROFOR representative, and including representatives of the Government of Croatia, local authorities and the ECMM to oversee restoration of Croatian control <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> zones.|$|E

5|$|Takechi's Daydream {{had been}} {{considered}} a national embarrassment by the Japanese government because of its highly publicized release while the world {{was focused on the}} country for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Takechi's third film had suffered heavily from the governmental censorship, yet no legal action had been taken. Takechi's fourth film, the Nikkatsu-produced Black Snow (1965), was even more controversial than his previous work. David Desser credits Black Snow with bringing a political theme to the pink film. Politics would be featured in many later films <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> genre, most notably those of Kōji Wakamatsu.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Miljevci Plateau was a {{clash of}} the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska - HV) and forces of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), fought on 21–23 June 1992, during the Croatian War of Independence. The battle {{represented}} {{the culmination of a}} series of skirmishes between the HV and the RSK forces in Northern Dalmatia, after the implementation of the Vance plan and deployment of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) began. The skirmishes occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> zones—areas under control of the RSK, but outside the UN Protected Areas established by the Vance plan.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{something}} of a stopgap for the band, who had already started work on The Dark Side of the Moon, and was recorded in two sessions in France between touring, with three days for mixing. The original plan was to just record small sections of music, but they ultimately created enough songs for a complete album. The resulting work has been overlooked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pink</b> Floyd canon because of the huge commercial success of later albums, but still has a positive reaction from fans and critics.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>pink</b> muscle {{of several}} Teleosts was {{examined}} immunohistochemically using antisera specific for the myosins {{of red and}} white muscle, and histochemically using various methods for demonstrating myosin ATPase (mATPase) activity. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> catfish <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> muscle consists of 2 different layers of fibres. The superficial layer has a low mATPase activity after both acid and alkali pre-incubation, whereas the deeper layer has a high mATPase activity after acid and alkali pre-incubation, being more resistent to these conditions even than is <b>the</b> white muscle. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> trout <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> muscle is composed of fibres with the same mATPase activity as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> superficial <b>pink</b> muscle of <b>the</b> catfish, whereas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rock goby, goldfish, mullet and guppy <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> muscle is like <b>the</b> deep <b>pink</b> layer of <b>the</b> catfish. Immunohistochemically the fibres of <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> muscle behave like the white muscle fibres except <b>in</b> <b>the</b> guppy and rock goby <b>in</b> which at <b>the</b> level of the lateral line there occurs a transition zone between red and <b>pink</b> fibres. <b>The</b> fibres of this region react with both anti-fast and (to a lesser extent) anti-slow myosin antisera, and have a mATPase activity which, going from the superficial to the deeper fibres, gradually loses the red muscle characteristics to acquire those of <b>the</b> main <b>pink</b> muscle layer...|$|R

5|$|On 21 June, the HV {{attacked}} RSK {{positions at}} the Miljevci Plateau, located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> zone north of Šibenik. The TO forces in the area were subordinated to the 1st Brigade of the TO, and Lieutenant Colonel General Milan Torbica. The HV deployed 250 troops, elements of the 113th and 142nd Infantry Brigades, commanded by Brigadier Kruno Mazalin. The HV had infiltrated the pink zone along three routes—via Nos Kalik, across the Čikola river and by boat sailing upstream along the Krka River, during the night of 20/21 June. The fighting began at 5a.m. as the HV force, deployed in 26 squads, captured six out of seven villages on the plateau {{by the end of}} the morning. At 8:00p.m., the HV captured the village of Ključ, and all of the plateau. The advance created a HV-held salient south of Knin, several kilometres deep. It also led the RSK artillery to bombard Šibenik and HV bombardment of Knin in response, both on 22 June.|$|E
5|$|The Qing Emperor's {{undercover}} emissary Jack Knife {{arrives in}} the village to monitor the gold and takes up residence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pink</b> Blossom, a brothel run by Madam Blossom, Lady Silk's madame. Silver sends members of the Rodent clan to kill Zen-Yi before he can reach the village, but Zen-Yi kills them. The mercenary Brass Body {{arrives in the}} village and meets with Silver; he is sent to kill Zen-Yi. The blacksmith meets with Silk in the brothel and delivers the final payment needed to free her. After arriving in the village, Zen-Yi and his men are confronted by Brass and find that they cannot physically harm him because his skin turns to metal on impact. Brass beats Zen-Yi and destroys his blade-laden armor. Zen-Yi's last surviving man sacrifices himself to pull a canopy support beam loose, burying Brass under heavy stone. The blacksmith is watching the fight; he rescues Zen-Yi and helps him recover as penance for crafting the weapon that killed Zen-Yi's father.|$|E
5|$|The {{road race}} {{stages in the}} Netherlands were both marred by {{repeated}} crashes, which led to some unexpected big time gaps before the transfer to Italy. The overall standings were very turbulent in the first week, with four different riders holding the race leader's pink jersey. The 11th stage greatly re-shaped the overall standings, when several riders, including Sastre, gained almost 13minutes against {{the remainder of the}} field. Porte took the pink jersey after this stage. Two days later, Arroyo took the jersey, and kept it for five days. He eventually lost it to Basso on the first of two very difficult mountain stages to close out the Giro. Success was fairly widespread among the Giro's 22teams, as 17 of them came away with either a stage win, classification win, or stint <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> jersey.|$|E
