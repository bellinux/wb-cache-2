5|$|When {{referring}} to cannon, the term <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> often used incorrectly. In military usage, a <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> a cannon {{with a high}} muzzle velocity and comparatively flat trajectory, as opposed to other types of artillery, such as howitzers or mortars, which have lower muzzle velocities, and usually fire indirectly.|$|E
5|$|An assault is {{not caused}} if a {{defendant}} threatens {{to shoot the}} victim, but the victim is aware that the <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> not loaded or fake. However, {{it would be the}} actus reus of an assault if the victim wrongly believes the <b>gun</b> <b>is,</b> or may be, loaded. Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted assault. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.|$|E

2500|$|... 57 55 J was {{accepted}} {{for use as}} training weapon in 1950s {{because of a lack}} of suitable training guns and no funds to buy new ones. The old 57mm Nordenfelt and Hotchkiss <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> worn-out, and 76mm <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> kept in reserve, so 57 55 J, among other old <b>guns,</b> <b>was</b> used as training piece. Some of the <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> converted for sub-caliber training for the 234/50 Be and 305/52 O <b>guns.</b> The <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> refurbished at beginning of the 1960s and sub-caliber <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> converted back to the normal configuration, but the <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> removed from use and placed into storage in 1965–1966.|$|R

5|$|When {{referring}} to cannon, the term <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> often used incorrectly. In military usage, a <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> a cannon {{with a high}} muzzle velocity and a flat trajectory, useful for hitting the sides of targets such as walls, as opposed to howitzers or mortars, which have lower muzzle velocities, and fire indirectly, lobbing shells up and over obstacles to hit the target from above.|$|E

Twelve of the <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> {{purchased}} personally by Union commanders {{and used in}} the trenches during the siege of Petersburg, Virginia (June 1864 - April 1865). Eight other Gatling <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> fitted on gunboats.

500|$|When {{the ship}} was being {{refitted}} from 1891–94, her anti-torpedo boat armament was reinforced by the replacement of three 25.4-millimeter Nordenfelt guns {{by a pair of}} 2.5-pounder Hotchkiss guns and a single 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun. Two additional 11-millimeter Nordenfelt guns in the fighting tops were also added at that time. After the Sino-Japanese War, a small poop deck was added in 1896 and a quick-firing (QF) [...] <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> mounted there as the stern chase gun. Another such <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> mounted on the forecastle as the forward chase gun and the two 17-centimeter <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> replaced by another pair of 12-centimeter quick-firers. In addition twelve 3-pounder Hotchkiss <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> added and the 11-millimeter <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> replaced by 25.4-millimeter Nordenfelts.

50|$|The 152 mm siege gun model 1910 (152-мм осадная пушка образца 1910 года) <b>was</b> a heavy <b>gun</b> {{used by the}} Russian Army in World War I.

5|$|Abramski v. United States, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court found that making {{arrangements}} for a straw purchase of a <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> in violation of the Gun Control Act of 1968, and is different from re-selling or gifting a previously purchased gun. In the Abramski case, a former police officer from Virginia took advantage of a local discount to buy a gun for his uncle and later transferred it to Pennsylvania—the uncle's residence—using the appropriate federal procedure. During the purchase, Abramski falsely declared that he is purchasing the gun for himself.|$|E
5|$|Cannon: The {{earliest}} known {{depiction of}} a cannon is a sculpture from the Dazu Rock Carvings in Sichuan dated to 1128, however the earliest archaeological samples and textual accounts do not appear until the 13th century. The primary extant specimens of cannon from the 13th century are the Wuwei Bronze Cannon dated to 1227, the Heilongjiang hand cannon dated to 1288, and the Xanadu Gun dated to 1298. However, only the Xanadu gun contains an inscription bearing a date of production, so it is considered the earliest confirmed extant cannon. The Xanadu <b>Gun</b> <b>is</b> 34.7cm in length and weighs 6.2kg. The other cannon are dated using contextual evidence.|$|E
5|$|Halo {{departs from}} {{traditional}} FPS conventions by not forcing the player character to holster its firearm before deploying grenades or melee-range blunt instruments; instead, both attacks can be utilized while a <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> still equipped, supplanting or supplementing small-arms fire. All weapons {{may be used}} to bludgeon enemies, which allows Master Chief to silently kill opponents without alerting other nearby enemies. The Chief can also carry up to eight grenades at a time: up to four fragmentation and four plasma grenades each. Like the game's other weapons, the two types of grenades differ; the fragmentation grenade bounces and detonates quickly, whereas the plasma grenade adheres to targets before exploding, sometimes with blackly comic results.|$|E

5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{in which}} the player uses a rifle-shaped light gun to fire at targets on the screen. One duck at a time flies across the screen, with each duck {{appearing}} {{in a different place}} {{on the sides of the}} screen and flying in different paths. The player is allowed three shots to hit the duck as it flies across the screen. As with other light gun games, a hit is registered if the <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> pointed at the duck or similar light source when the trigger is pulled; no projectile is fired. When a shot is fired, a mark appears on the screen where the player was aiming; if the shot misses the duck, it changes direction away from the bullet. If the player hits a duck, it falls to the ground, and a hunting dog runs over and collects it. Each duck hit adds a small image of a duck to a row at the top of the screen. An screen overlay shows an image of marsh reeds and a tree branch. The <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> attached to the game cabinet by a metal cord, and is holstered in a small circular recess in the cabinet when not in use. Attempting to remove the gun sounds an alarm buzzer. Each game costs a quarter, and runs until the time limit runs out. Machines have adjustable time limits or can be set to run each game indefinitely, starting the score count over when the start button is pressed.|$|E

5|$|When {{trying to}} explain past phenomena, paleontologists and other {{historical}} scientists often construct a set of hypotheses about the causes and then look for a smoking gun, a {{piece of evidence that}} indicates that one hypothesis is a better explanation than others. Sometimes the smoking <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> discovered by a fortunate accident during other research. For example, the discovery by Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez of an iridium-rich layer at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary made asteroid impact and volcanism the most favored explanations for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.|$|E
5|$|Writing in the Handbook of Texas, {{historian}} Thomas Ricks Lindley {{maintains that}} the Wagner cannon does not match the Smithwick account.

It was likely melted down with many of the other cannons when the Mexican army retreated.|$|E
