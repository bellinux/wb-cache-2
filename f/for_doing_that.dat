I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E

Two flocks were selected in the north-eastern part of Zimbabwe and were monitored over two years. Flock entries and exits were recorded, body-mass changes measured fortnightly and blood samples collected in five consecutive weekly intervals in August-September 1988 and March-April 1989. The average kidding interval <b>for</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> kidded in August-December (382 ± 90 days) was longer (P< 0. 01) than <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> kidded in March-April (265 ± 48 days). The overall average kidding interval was 370 ± 122 days. Serum progesterone levels also indicated that of the 26 goats that kidded in October-December 1988, 65 % were non-pregnant 5 - 6 months after kidding. It is suggested that nutritional stress could be the cause of these long kidding intervals...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} risk factors for culling, sales and deaths in intensively managed dairy goat herds in New Zealand. A data set provided by the New Zealand Dairy Goat Cooperative (n[*]=[*] 13, 197 does) was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazard model. The outcome of interest was length of productive life (LPL), defined as the number of days from the date of second kidding to the date of removal from the herd or the date on which follow-up was terminated, whichever occurred first. Milk solids yield in the first lactation (MSL 1) as a predictor of LPL was parameterized in the model as a penalized spline term. To account for MSL 1 violating the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model, LPL was divided into two intervals: T 1 (less than or equal to 730 [*]days from the date of second kidding) and T 2 (greater than 730 [*]days from the date of second kidding). MSL 1 was then included in the model as a time-dependent covariate. A frailty term was included in the model to account for unmeasured, herd-level effects on LPL. During T 1, the daily hazard of removal <b>for</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> produced 80 [*]kg milk solids in the first lactation was 0. 84 (95 % CI 0. 58 – 1. 23) times the daily hazard of removal <b>for</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> produced 30 [*]kg milk solids in the first lactation. During T 2, the daily hazard of removal <b>for</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> produced 80 [*]kg milk solids in the first lactation was 1. 44 (95 % CI 0. 79 – 2. 65) times the daily hazard of removal <b>for</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> produced 30 [*]kg milk solids in the first lactation. We conclude that involuntary losses may be avoided if high MSL 1 yielding does are preferentially managed from 2 [*]years beyond the date of second kidding...|$|R

25|$|Epigraphical {{evidence}} {{show that}} a Jewish community had existed in Benevento since the fifth century at least. At the 10th century, Jewish traveller Ahimaaz ben Paltiel describes in his chronicle the Jewish community of Benevento, among other southern Italy towns. One of his relatives established a Yeshiva in town and {{a large part of}} his family ended residing in Benevento. In 1065, prince Landulf IV of Benevento forced a number of Jews to convert to Christianity. He was reproved <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> by Pope Alexander II. When Jewish traveller Benjamin of Tudela visited Benevento in 1159 or 1165, he described 200 Jewish families living in it. Being under Papal rule (unlike the rest of southern Italy), the Jewish community of Benevento was not expelled, as most other southern Italy Jewish communities in 1541. Nevertheless, they were expelled from town later on 1569, under Pope Paul IV. In 1617 the Jewish community was given permission to settle back in town, though 13 years later they were expelled once again after being accused of Well poisoning. Since then, there was no organized Jewish community in Benevento. Nevertheless, Jews had lived in Benevento in an unorganized manner during the past centuries, in addition to a few Israeli Jews living in town in recent years, occasionally suffering of Anti-Semitic incidents.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, Marshall {{took issue}} with the Court's {{conclusion}} that the same standard for ineffectiveness should apply in a capital sentencing proceeding that applies at an ordinary trial. The capital sentencing process {{is intended to be}} especially reliable, and [...] "reliability in the imposition of the death sentence can be approximated only if the sentencer is fully informed of all possible relevant information about the individual defendant whose fate it must determine." [...] The defendant's attorney is responsible <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that.</b> That and in light of the [...] "severity and irrevocability of the sanction at stake," [...] the standard for effective assistance in capital sentencing proceedings must be especially stringent. Accordingly, Marshall believed that a person on death row seeking relief from his death sentence on grounds of ineffective assistance should not have to show a reasonable probability that he would not have received a death sentence if counsel had presented more mitigating evidence. Because it was clear that Washington's attorney had failed to investigate and then present large amounts of information to the sentencing judge, Marshall concluded that Washington's lawyer was ineffective.|$|E
2500|$|Noting {{the growing}} union support, {{an article in}} the progressive-leaning Mother Jones {{magazine}} said that union support could splinter and derail the protests rather than sustain them because while unions are tightly organized, hierarchical, and run with a clear chain of command, Occupy Wall Street is the opposite in that they are [...] "a horizontal, autonomous, leaderless, modified-consensus-based system with roots in anarchist thought." [...] However, the article went on to suggest that if the unions and OWS joined together they could work to create a progressive movement that [...] "effectively taps into the rising feeling among many Americans that economic opportunity has been squashed by corporate greed and the influence of the very rich in politics." [...] As the success of the movement has become apparent, union organizers have begun to embrace some of their social media skills, bold tactics, and the simplicity of the 99% slogan. Damon Silvers, the AFL–CIO's policy director, said, “We think the Occupy movement has given voice to something very basic about what’s going on in our country right now. The fact that they’ve figured out certain concepts and language <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> we think is really important and positive.” The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) has endorsed the movement saying, [...] "We recognize the need to work together and learn from each other. The vitality, energy and dialogue growing from the Occupy Wall Street movement show the potential to organize, build power and win justice for the middle class.” ...|$|E
