My original conception of the story was that Cigarette-Smoking Man was a much better actor at winning Scully's affections and that Scully was less resistant to this attention to her."

According to the actress, her father (Mohammed Kaif) is a British {{businessman}} of Kashmiri descent and her mother (Suzanne, also spelt Susanna) is an English lawyer and charity worker. She has seven siblings: three elder sisters (Stephanie, Christine, and Natasha), three younger sisters (Melissa, Sonia, and Isabel) and an elder brother, Michael. Isabelle Kaif is also a model and actress. Kaif's parents divorced {{when she was a}} child, and her father moved to the United States. She said her father had no influence on Kaif or her siblings while they were growing up, and they were raised by their mother. On her father's absence in her life, Kaif stated: [...] "When I see friends who have wonderful fathers who are like pillars of support for their families, I say, if only <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>that.</b> But instead of complaining, I should be grateful for all the other things I have".

Between {{the end of the last}} Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: [...] "For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them.

500|$|In interviews, Hendrix usually gave {{different}} {{answers about}} the development of the song's lyrics. [...] Biographer Harry Shapiro points out that [...] "Purple Haze" [...] is most likely [...] "a pot-pourri of ideas" [...] which Hendrix developed over time. [...] As a fan of science fiction, he frequently incorporated its imagery in his songwriting. [...] Hendrix read Night of Light, a 1966 novel by Philip Jose Farmer, that expanded on a short story published in 1957. [...] In the story set on a distant planet, sunspots produce a [...] "purplish haze" [...] which has a disorienting effect on the inhabitants. [...] An early handwritten draft by Hendrix, titled [...] "Purple Haze – Jesus Saves", uses dream-like imagery where the sense of direction and time is distorted. [...] In an interview on January 28, 1967, before the song was completed, Hendrix was asked how he wrote songs; he responded, [...] "I dream a lot and I put my dreams down as songs. I wrote one called 'First Look Around the Corner' and another called 'The Purple Haze,' which was about a dream <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> I was walking under the sea." [...] He later expressed frustration that he was unable to more fully develop his ideas for the song: ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the lyrics}} to [...] "Purple Haze", which opened the US edition of Are You Experienced, are often misinterpreted as {{describing}} an acid trip, Hendrix explained: [...] " [...] was all about a dream <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> I was walking under the sea." [...] He speculated that the dream may {{have been inspired by}} a science fiction story about a purple death ray. Redding stated that Hendrix had not yet taken LSD {{at the time of the}} song's writing, which was after a gig in London on December 26, 1966. The first draft of the lyrics was exceedingly long, so Chandler and Hendrix reduced its length to something appropriate for mainstream pop music. It opens with a guitar/bass harmony in the interval of a tritone that was known as the diabolus in musica during the time of the Spanish Inquisition. The Catholic Church prohibited medieval composers of religious music from using the tritone, or flattened fifth, because as musicologist Dave Whitehill wrote: [...] "to play it was like ringing Satan's doorbell." [...] In the opinion of the author Ritchie Unterberger, the opening riff has [...] "become a permanent part of rock's vocabulary." [...] Whereas Rolling Stone described the song as the beginning of late-60s psychedelia, the authors Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek identified Hendrix's use of R, funk, and soul elements in the track.|$|E
500|$|Before Megan Mullally {{was given}} the role of Karen, she had {{previously}} been cast as a series regular on sitcoms such as The Ellen Burstyn Show, My Life and Times, and Rachel Gunn. Mullally guest starred on many other shows, including Ned & Stacey, on which she first worked with Messing. Mullally informed her agent {{that she did not}} want to do any more sitcoms or auditions for sitcoms, during the time that Will & Grace came around. [...] "Because my feeling was, like, Look, I've done it. It's not clicking. It's not for me. But he [...] was always arguing the point that the right thing hadn't come along yet." [...] She initially auditioned for the role of Grace, but admitted that {{she did not want to}} audition for the part of Karen. When asked about Karen's voice, Mullally revealed that the voice was an [...] "instinctive thing". She also said, [...] "...I think it was just a feeling that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> it would be better for the pace of the show and it would be funnier in some way, but I didn't know why.

Wahlberg {{was the first}} actor to sign on as a star of the film during its early stages of development. He agreed to portray Luttrell after reading Peter Berg's script. Wahlberg chose not to read Luttrell's book Lone Survivor during production to avoid arguments with Berg over events and details that were {{left out in the}} book. [...] "The problem when adapting a piece of material like that is that you always feel like something is missing", he explained. [...] "I wanted to come at it from this perspective." [...] Of Wahlberg's portrayal, Luttrell stated, [...] "Wahlberg is a consummate professional, and he's a great actor. It was a little strange watching somebody trying to play me, but we talked about it and I knew it would turn out great. I was more worried about the other guys because they’re not around to speak for themselves." [...] Wahlberg has since cited Lone Survivor as his favorite film role as an actor and producer: [...] "This is the best working experience I’ve ever had, under the toughest conditions. I remember early on as an actor, you worked a long, hard day, but you did something you felt was special, and that car ride home you couldn’t stop thinking about it. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> feeling every day on this movie." ...|$|E
500|$|The seventh season {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics, although increasingly critical reviews were more common this season. While critics enjoyed {{many of the}} episodes, many also felt that, as a whole, the season was the weakest of the show's original seven. Eric Mink of the New York Daily News praised the season, noting that it was [...] "proof that The X-Files still has more than enough creative life in it to justify an eighth season". He called many of the stand-alone episodes [...] "wonderfully creepy" [...] and noted that the season possessed a [...] "terrific bunch of episodes". Thomas Doherty from Cinefantastique gave the season a mixed review and noted that the series was hurt by the partnership between Mulder and Scully [...] "settl into the comfortable groove of a modern two career marriage—supportive, professionally rewarding, and utterly sexless." [...] Further, he noted that [...] "the most entertaining episode lately have been the self parodies, where killer cockroaches scurry and living dead roam, or where (in the Duchovny written and directed episode) Scully and Mulder are played by Téa Leoni and Garry Shandling in a motion picture only slightly more ludicrous than a 1998 motion picture called The X-Files." [...] Doherty argued that the [...] "self-parody" [...] style of the series caused viewers to not take it seriously anymore, explaining that, [...] "No longer going for the big chill, Carter and company are winking at their audience, as if to say: even we can't pretend to believe in this muddled mishmash anymore." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, was positive towards {{the first half of}} the season, but soon saw the episodes in more of a negative light. He wrote, [...] "A season that began with such hope ended with a sense of sorrow given the end result of the season-long backstage wheeling and dealing [...] Not even the magnificent season finale [...] could erase the nagging doubts <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> a series that had been so amazing for so long would soon embark upon a new course wrought with pitfalls and turmoil."

Apparently it has been used a lot and it was nice to hear. The ironic thing, though, is that the song was actually written for the fans. It was over six minutes long and was never meant to be a hit or anything like that. It was meant to be an opening for the 'live' show. We were putting out our third album and we wanted a really 'grand' opening for the show. So, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> 'riff' tucked away in a drawer since my college years and I took it out, found a tempo for it, wrote lyrics, {{and it turned out to}} be a great opening for that album and for the show, as well.

Faut reached her peak of the season on July 21, when she hurled a perfect game against the visiting Rockford Peaches at Playland Park. Ahead 2–0, she struck out five of the last nine hitters, including pitching ace Helen Nicol to end the game. Faut gave considerable credit for her perfect performance to the flawless fielding of her teammates. I had an extremely good team behind me, she recalled years later. To this day she remembered the shoestring catch Wagoner made on the right field foul line in the second inning.
