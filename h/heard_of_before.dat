5|$|Gröning {{worked as}} a {{bookkeeper}} for a year until 1942, when the SS ordered that desk jobs would be reserved for injured veterans, and that fit members in administrative roles were {{to be subjected to}} more challenging duties. Gröning and about 22 of his colleagues travelled to Berlin where they reported to one of the SS economic offices. They were then given a lecture by several high-ranking officers who reminded them of the oath of loyalty they took, which they could prove by doing a difficult task. The task was top secret – Gröning and his comrades had to sign a declaration that they would not disclose it to family or friends, or people not in their unit. Once this had concluded, they were split into smaller groups and taken to various Berlin stations where they boarded a train in the direction of Katowice with orders to report to the commandant of Auschwitz, a place Gröning had not <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
25|$|Attached to Company C, 1st Battalion, 1st Marines {{upon his}} arrival at Goodenough Island, D'Entrecasteaux Islands, early in December 1943, PFC Fardy left with that unit {{about a week}} later for Nascing, Alatu, New Guinea. The stay there was a short one also, for the 1st Marines left Finschaffen on Christmas Day 1943, for their December 26 landing on enemy-held Cape Gloucester, New Britain. Within two months of the time he left his home shores, the former {{draftsman}} was involved in a battle for an enemy airdrome on an island rarely <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{spaceship}} appears out {{of nowhere}} over Atlantis. John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) and his team discover that the ship is the Daedalus, which is strange as Stargate Command confirms that the Daedalus is actually two days away from Earth. Sheppard's team boards the new Daedalus and find it apparently abandoned with signs of battle damage. Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) views a log entry from the Daedalus commander, Colonel Sobel, who the team has never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>before.</b> Suddenly, there is a power spike and the Daedalus disappears from above Atlantis, while {{from the perspective of}} Sheppard's team, Atlantis disappears. McKay finds that they have been propelled into a parallel universe by what he terms an [...] "alternate reality drive", and thus the Daedalus is actually from an alternate reality.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} on creating believable video game characters, Bungie's Joseph Staten noted that, [...] "Master Chief is really what kicked off the creativity," [...] he said, [...] "in terms of how people react to him. He's a space Marine in really cool green armor." [...] The character's perspective changed as the game itself changed from a real-time strategy game to a first-person shooter, but the Chief was always {{intended to be a}} soldier in the last part of a long and bitter war. For much of the game's development, the character had no name. The developers spent time considering what rank and branch of the armed forces the Chief would belong to—naval ranks grabbed them as [...] "different" [...] from ones the developers had <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>before.</b> [...] "Master Chief" [...] was intended to be a placeholder while a real name was finalized, but the moniker stuck.|$|E
500|$|In September 1510, a {{group of}} Dominican friars arrived in Santo Domingo led by Pedro de Córdoba; appalled by the injustices they saw {{committed}} by the slaveowners against the Indians, they decided to deny slave owners the right to confession. Las Casas was among those denied confession for this reason. In December 1511, a Dominican preacher Fray Antonio de Montesinos preached a fiery sermon that implicated the colonists in the genocide of the native peoples. He {{is said to have}} preached, [...] "Tell me by what right of justice do you hold these Indians in such a cruel and horrible servitude? On what authority have you waged such detestable wars against these people who dealt quietly and peacefully on their own lands? Wars in which you have destroyed such an infinite number of them by homicides and slaughters never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>before.</b> Why do you keep them so oppressed and exhausted, without giving them enough to eat or curing them of the sicknesses they incur from the excessive labor you give them, and they die, or rather you kill them, in order to extract and acquire gold every day." [...] Las Casas himself argued against the Dominicans in favour of the justice of the encomienda. The colonists, led by Diego Columbus, dispatched a complaint against the Dominicans to the King, and the Dominicans were recalled from Hispaniola.|$|E
2500|$|After Disney's {{acquisition}} of Marvel Entertainment in 2009, CEO Bob Iger encouraged the company's divisions to explore Marvel's properties for adaptation concepts. By deliberately picking an obscure title, {{it would give}} them the freedom {{to come up with}} their own version. While directing Winnie the Pooh, director Don Hall was scrolling through a Marvel database when he stumbled upon Big Hero 6, a comic he had never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>before.</b> [...] "I just liked the title," [...] he said. He pitched the concept to John Lasseter in 2011, as one of five ideas for possible productions for Walt Disney Animation Studios, and this particular idea [...] "struck a chord" [...] with Lasseter, Hall, and Chris Williams.|$|E

2500|$|Vladimir Kosmich Zworykin {{was born}} in Murom, Russia, in 1888, on July 29 (old style July 17), {{to the family of}} a prosperous merchant. He had a {{relatively}} calm upbringing, and he rarely saw his father except on religious holidays. He studied at the St. Petersburg Institute of Technology, under Boris Rosing. He helped Rosing with experimental work on television in the basement of Rosing's private lab at the School of Artillery of Saint Petersburg. [...] They worked on the problem of [...] "electrical telescopy," [...] something Zworykin had never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>before.</b> [...] At this time, electrical telescopy (or television as it was later called) was just a dream. [...] Zworykin did not know that others had been studying the idea since the 1880s, or that Professor Rosing had been working on it in secret since 1902 and had made excellent progress. Rosing had filed his first patent on a television system in 1907, featuring a very early cathode ray tube as a receiver, and a mechanical device as a transmitter. Its demonstration in 1911, based on an improved design, was the first world's demonstration of TV of any kind.|$|E
2500|$|When {{he arrived}} back in Sydney in 1805 Macarthur further antagonised local {{authorities}} by claiming his 5,000 acres (20km²) in the Cowpastures. This was prime grazing land, well supplied by {{water from the}} Nepean river, and reserved by the Governor exclusively for the colony's cattle herds. Both Governors King and Bligh strongly objected to this and wanted the grant moved, but the Colonial Office wrote back affirming Macarthur's right to the land. Macarthur named it Camden Park after his patron. Bligh also turned down Macarthur's request for the remaining 5000 acres (20km²) after he had begun exporting wool to England. Bligh was firmly opposed to Macarthur's venture, according to Evatt, not because he objected to the fine wool industry, but because he believed that 'first preference {{should be given to}} agriculture'. As reported much later by Macarthur, Bligh said to him in a conversation at Government House; [...] "What have I to do with your sheep, sir? What have I to do with your cattle. Are you to have such flocks of sheep and such herds of cattle as no man ever <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>before?</b> No, sir!".|$|E

6000|$|... "So {{that was}} Major Grantly?" [...] said John. [...] "I have <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> him <b>before,</b> I think. He is {{a son of}} the old archdeacon, is he not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Oh, yes! Thanks. It’s a {{very poor}} jest. Change from body to body as {{travellers}} used to change horses at post houses. I’ve <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> this <b>before.</b> [...] .” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, p'raps it is Auberly; but {{whichever}} it is, he's got {{a pretty}} kettle o' fish to look after this mornin'. You seem to have <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> him <b>before,</b> mother?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must remember, Chastel," [...] said he, [...] "that {{he comes}} to us from some strange, distant island, having customs {{different}} from ours--a thing I had never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>before.</b> I can give you no other explanation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well. This goes {{clear away}} ahead of {{anything}} I ever <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>before.</b> Do you--now I ask {{you as a}} man and a brother--do you think I could venture to throw a rock here in any given direction without hitting a captain of this ship?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have written}} the last lines of this diary {{sitting on the}} deck. We have just passed a huge statue that rises out of the water, the name of which they {{mentioned}} but I can't remember, as it was not anything I ever <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E

50|$|The 2009 prize {{awarded to}} Herta Müller was {{attacked}} because many US literary critics and professors had never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Müller <b>before.</b> This reignited {{criticism that the}} committee was too Eurocentric.|$|R

60|$|When {{the grave}} {{had been filled}} with earth the little party {{turned back toward the}} cabin, and Esmeralda, still weeping copiously for the two she had never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>before</b> today, and who had been dead twenty years, chanced to glance toward the harbor. Instantly her tears ceased.|$|E
60|$|Aristabulus stood aghast! To indict {{the public}} was a step he had never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>before,</b> {{and he began to}} {{perceive}} that the question actually had two sides. Still, his awe of public meetings, and his habitual regard for popularity, induced him not to give up the matter, without another struggle.|$|E
60|$|Having perfected his arrangements, {{he would}} get my pipe, and, {{lighting}} it, would hand it to me.
