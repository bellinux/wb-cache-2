5|$|The Earp party rode {{north to}} the Percy Ranch, but were not welcomed by Hugh and Jim Percy, who feared the Cowboys; after a meal and some rest, they left around 3:00 {{in the morning of}} March 27. The Earp party slipped into the area near Tombstone and met with supporters, {{including}} Hairlip Charlie Smith and Warren Earp. On March 27, the posse arrived at the Sierra Bonita Ranch owned by Henry Hooker, a wealthy and prominent rancher. That night, Dan Tipton caught the first stage out of Tombstone and headed for Benson, carrying $1,000 from mining owner and Earp supporter E. B. Gage for the posse. Hooker congratulated Earp on the killing of Curly Bill. Hooker <b>fed</b> <b>them</b> and Wyatt told him he wanted to buy new mounts. Hooker was known for his purebred stallions and ran over 500 brood mares that produced horses that became known for their speed, beauty, and temperament. He provided Wyatt and his posse with new mounts, but refused to take Wyatt's money. When Behan's posse was observed in the distance, Hooker suggested Wyatt make his stand there, but Wyatt moved into the hills about three miles (5km) distant near Reilly Hill.|$|E

After six months, the natives halted the food supply.|$|E

The boys were {{frequently}} naughty, but were rarely disciplined. He claimed that the incident with the bench occurred, but he was only having a joke, did not actually tie Dennis to the bench, did not beat him, and they were all laughing about it.|$|E
25|$|B12 {{deficiency}} is {{the cause}} of pernicious anemia, an anemic disease that was usually fatal and had unknown etiology when it was first described in medicine. The cure, and B12, were discovered by accident. George Whipple had been doing experiments in which he induced anemia in dogs by bleeding them, and then <b>fed</b> <b>them</b> various foods to observe which diets allowed them fastest recovery from the anemia produced. In the process, he discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to most rapidly cure the anemia of blood loss. Thus, he hypothesized that liver ingestion might treat pernicious anemia. He tried this and reported some signs of success in 1920.|$|E
25|$|The P7 is a {{semi-automatic}} blowback-operated firearm. It {{features a}} unique gas-delayed blowback locking system {{modeled on the}} Swiss Pistole 47 W+F (Waffenfabrik Bern) prototype pistol (and ultimately on the Barnitzke system first used in the Volkssturmgewehr 1-5), which used gas pressures from the ignited cartridge and <b>fed</b> <b>them</b> through a small port in the barrel (in front of the chamber) to retard the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished {{by means of a}} piston contained inside a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined—after the bullet has left the barrel—hence allowing the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech and ejecting the empty cartridge case.|$|E

25|$|Physical {{inactivity}} as a {{child could}} result in physical inactivity as an adult. In a fitness survey of 6,000 adults, researchers discovered that 25% {{of those who were}} considered active at ages 14 to 19 were also active adults, compared to 2% of those who were inactive at ages 14 to 19, who were now said to be active adults. Staying physically inactive leaves unused energy in the body, most of which is stored as fat. Researchers studied 16 men over a 14-day period and <b>fed</b> <b>them</b> 50% more of their energy required every day through fats and carbohydrates. They discovered that carbohydrate overfeeding produced 75–85% excess energy being stored as body fat and fat overfeeding produced 90–95% storage of excess energy as body fat.|$|E
25|$|Construction of St Paul's Church, {{designed}} by Roger Eykyn, {{and the surrounding}} St Paul's Square commenced in 1777 and was completed in 1779. Georgian houses aimed at the prosperous middle class were constructed around the square, some of which survive such as Nos 12-14, which are Grade II listed, {{on the eastern side}} of the square. A plan of Birmingham by Thomas Hanson in 1778 shows that most of the Newhall estate had been laid out in a grid-like pattern from St Paul's Church. The plan also showed that two pools, Great and Little Pool, had been filled in and the brook that <b>fed</b> <b>them</b> had been canalised. However, New Hall still blocked further development down Newhall Street. In the early 1770s, Matthew Boulton had been using the premises partially as a warehouse and when plans for its demolition were aired, he resisted them. However, the house was demolished in 1787 with only the barn left standing until Boulton's new warehouse was completed on Livery Street in 1788.|$|E
25|$|In total, {{only six}} Australian {{servicemen}} {{managed to escape}}. During the second marches, Gunner Owen Campbell and Bombardier Richard Braithwaite managed to escape into the jungle, where they were assisted by locals and eventually rescued by Allied units. During July, Private Nelson Short, Warrant Officer William Sticpewich, Private Keith Botterill and Lance Bombardier William Moxham managed to escape from Ranau and were also helped by the local people, who <b>fed</b> <b>them</b> and hid them from the Japanese {{until the end of}} the war. Of the six survivors, only four (Sticpewich, Botterill, Short, & Campbell) survived the lingering effects of their ordeal to give evidence at various war crimes trials in both Tokyo and Rabaul. The world was able to receive eyewitness accounts of the crimes and atrocities committed. Captain Hoshijima was found guilty of war crimes and hanged on 6 April 1946. Capt Takakuwa and his second-in-charge, Capt Watanabe Genzo, were found guilty of causing the murders and massacres of prisoners-of-war and were hanged and shot on 6 April 1946 and 16 March 1946 respectively.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the number}} of visiting eagles fluctuated, about 200 to 300 eagles would show up each day during the months of winter and early spring.

[...] By the early 20th century, there were {{tens of thousands}} of Poitevins in France, but this period saw the beginning of the breed's decline. Poitevin colts, which were not used for the breeding of mules, were considered [...] "soft" [...] and less valuable than the major draft horse breed of the 19th century – the Percheron. Some horse dealers purchased young gray Poitevin horses, <b>fed</b> <b>them</b> heavily to make them larger and stronger, and then sold them at the age of four as Percherons.

500|$|The {{three major}} {{elements}} of the Imperial Roman state were the central government, the military, and provincial government. The military established control of a territory through war, but after a city or people was brought under treaty, the military mission turned to policing: protecting Roman citizens (after 212 AD, all freeborn inhabitants of the Empire), the agricultural fields that <b>fed</b> <b>them,</b> and religious sites. Without modern instruments of either mass communication or mass destruction, the Romans lacked sufficient manpower or resources to impose their rule through force alone. Cooperation with local power elites was necessary to maintain order, collect information, and extract revenue. The Romans often exploited internal political divisions by supporting one faction over another: {{in the view of}} Plutarch, [...] "it was discord between factions within cities that led to the loss of self-governance".|$|E

500|$|... "Drowned World/Substitute for Love" [...] was {{recorded}} {{along with the}} rest of the album at Larrabee North Studio in North Hollywood, California. It was mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Studios in New York. An ambient poptrack, it takes the title from author J.G. Ballard's post-apocalyptic science fiction novel, The Drowned World (1962). The final version progressed significantly from the demo in the DAT, which Orbit described as [...] "serendipity". However they still kept the initial roughness, feeling against too many tweaks. The producer added random echoing and pulsating sound effects, and the drum fills were created from splicing up little fragments of music. Madonna and Orbit had conducted a drummer session in Los Angeles, but it did not work out. So he contacted Fergus Gerrand who played drum samples for him in London. Orbit <b>fed</b> <b>them</b> in his workstation and cut them manually, instead of using auto-editing software like ReCycle.|$|E
500|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the election, the Heart of Uptown Coalition and a Shiller {{supporter}} who was director of the Center for Street People, 4455 N. Broadway, organized a voter registration drive that registered 80 homeless people using the Center's address, and on election day <b>fed</b> <b>them</b> a meal at a local church hall and helped them vote. Jesus People USA, a 500-member commune/business/charity/religious group with many members living in the ward, had supported Orbach throughout his career, but switched to Shiller before the run-off. Jesus People's spokesman explained [...] "We think Jerry Orbach is a lovely man, but he doesn't have what it takes to stand up to the development...If things keep going there will be massive displacement. People will be thrown out of their homes. We decided that Helen Shiller would do the most to prevent displacement." [...] Orbach supporters charged that a City official had offered City contracts to the Jesus People's construction firm if Shiller were elected. On Tuesday, April 7, 1987 Shiller defeated Orbach by 498 votes, 9,751 to 9,253, and contributed to a narrow, pro-Washington, reform-minded majority in the City Council which helped draw the Council Wars era to close.|$|E
500|$|Tales abounded of prospectors {{spending}} {{huge sums}} on entertainment— Jimmy McMahon once spent $28,000 ($760,000) {{in a single}} evening, for example. Most payments were made in gold dust and in places like saloons, {{there was so much}} spilled gold that a profit could be made just by sweeping the floor. Some of the richest prospectors lived flamboyantly in Dawson. Swiftwater Bill Gates, a gambler and ladies man who rarely went anywhere without wearing silk and diamonds, was one of them. To impress a woman who liked eggs—then an expensive luxury—he was alleged to have bought all the eggs in Dawson, had them boiled and <b>fed</b> <b>them</b> to dogs. Another miner, Frank Conrad, threw a sequence of gold objects onto the ship when his favourite [...] singer left Dawson City as tokens of his esteem. [...] The wealthiest dance-hall girls followed suit: Daisy D'Avara had a belt made for herself from $340 ($9,200) in gold dollar coins; another, Gertie Lovejoy, had a diamond inserted between her two front teeth. The miner and businessman Alex McDonald, despite being styled the [...] "King of the Klondike", was unusual amongst his peers for his lack of grandiose spending.|$|E
