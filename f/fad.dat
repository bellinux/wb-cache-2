40|$|Since its {{identification}} in 2000, no function {{has been}} attributed to the Fatty Acid Desaturase 3 (<b>Fads</b> 3) gene. This gene is located within the <b>Fads</b> cluster, which also contains <b>Fads</b> 1 and <b>Fads</b> 2, coding respectively for the Δ 5 - and Δ 6 - desaturases. Based on the sequence homology between these three genes, <b>Fads</b> 3 may be a new fatty acid desaturase. It is thus essential to understand its involvement in Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA) biosynthesis in order to improve our knowledge on lipid metabolism. Gene expression studies provided evidences on the specificity of <b>Fads</b> 3 compared to <b>Fads</b> 1 and <b>Fads</b> 2, concerning the tissue distribution, alternative splicing and regulation. These works also identified possible physiological functions in which <b>Fads</b> 3 could be involved. Thus, the <b>Fads</b> 3 gene was transcripted in many tissues, and displayed a weak expression in the liver compared to other organs such as the lung or spleen. <b>Fads</b> 3 was also showed to be a target gene for NK-κB, MYCN or p 63 transcription factors and could consequently be involved in cell survival mechanisms. Polymorphism analysis underlined the possible implication of <b>Fads</b> 3 in lipid homeostasis, particularly by modulating cholesterol and triglyceride plasma levels. In terms of proteins, FADS 3 has been recently described in rodents. One of the identified isoforms may display the classical structure of a fatty acid desaturase but no enzymatic activity has been observed yet. Therefore, it is essential to consider the desaturase diversity in terms of catalysis and substrates to elucidate the FADS 3 function...|$|R
40|$|Long-chain {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} (LC-PUFAs) such as arachidonic (ARA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids are essential components of biomembranes, particularly in neural tissues. Endogenous synthesis of ARA, EPA and DHA occurs from precursor dietary {{essential fatty acids}} such as linoleic and a-linolenic acid through elongation and D 5 and D 6 desaturations. With respect to desaturation activities some noteworthy differences have been noted in vertebrate classes. In mammals, the D 5 activity is allocated to the <b>Fads</b> 1 gene, while <b>Fads</b> 2 is a D 6 desaturase. In contrast, teleosts show distinct combinations of desaturase activities (e. g. bifunctional or separate D 5 and D 6 desaturases) apparently allocated to <b>Fads</b> 2 -type genes. To determine the timing of <b>Fads</b> 1 -D 5 and <b>Fads</b> 2 -D 6 evolution in vertebrates we used a combination of comparative and functional genomics with the analysis of key phylogenetic species. Our data show that <b>Fads</b> 1 and <b>Fads</b> 2 genes with D 5 and D 6 activities respectively, evolved before gnathostome radiation, since the catshark Scyliorhinus canicula has functional orthologues of both gene families. Consequently, the loss of <b>Fads</b> 1 in teleosts is a secondary episode, while the existence of D 5 activities in the same group most likely occurred through independent mutations into <b>Fads</b> 2 type genes. Unexpectedly, we also establish that events of <b>Fads</b> 1 gene expansion {{have taken place in}} birds and reptiles. Finally, a fourth <b>Fads</b> gene (<b>Fads</b> 4) was found with an exclusive occurrence in mammalian genomes.

40|$|International audienceAggregations of fish around fish {{aggregation}} devices (<b>FADs)</b> {{have been}} widely described in the literature; most commercial catches of tuna by surface fisheries are performed around <b>FADs,</b> taking advantage of this behaviour. The meeting point hypothesis (MPH) suggests that fish could make use of <b>FADs</b> to increase the chance of encounters between conspecifics, helping individuals to form larger schools. To attempt a validation of the MPH, we performed an experiment {{in the field to}} test the following predictions: (1) fish spend more time at <b>FADs</b> than at any other random points and therefore aggregate around <b>FADs,</b> and (2) fish arrive at <b>FADs</b> as isolated individuals or in small groups and leave them in larger groups. Our investigation involved acoustic telemetry techniques commonly used to observe fish at <b>FADs.</b> The study was carried out on a small pelagic fish species, the bigeye scad, Selar crumenophthalmus, in Saint-Paul's Bay (Reunion Island). Our results validated our two predictions: <b>FADs</b> acted as retention points, increasing the encounter rate of fish and enhancing schooling behaviour, thereby supporting the meeting point hypothesis. <b>FADs</b> could be beneficial to the fitness of the associated fish, promote increased school size and hence confer the advantages of being in a larger group. The impact of the deployment of large number of <b>FADs</b> in some ocean regions is reinterpreted in light of our results...|$|R

40|$|Rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, are intensively cultured globally. Understanding their {{requirement}} for long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) and the biochemistry of the enzymes and biosynthetic pathways required for fatty acid synthesis {{is important and}} highly relevant in current aquaculture. Most gnathostome vertebrates have two fatty acid desaturase (<b>fads)</b> genes with known functions in LC-PUFA biosynthesis and termed <b>fads</b> 1 and <b>fads</b> 2. However, teleost fish have exclusively <b>fads</b> 2 genes. In rainbow trout, a <b>fads</b> 2 cDNA had been previously cloned and found to encode an enzyme with Δ 6 desaturase activity. In the present study, a second <b>fads</b> 2 cDNA was cloned from the liver of rainbow trout and termed <b>fads</b> 2 b. The full-length mRNA contained 1578 nucleotides with an open reading frame of 1365 nucleotides that encoded a 454 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 52. 48 kDa. The predicted <b>Fads</b> 2 b protein had the characteristic traits of the microsomal <b>Fads</b> family, including an N-terminal cytochrome b 5 domain containing the heme-binding motif (HPPG), histidine boxes (HDXGH, HFQHH and QIEHH) and three transmembrane regions. The <b>fads</b> 2 b was expressed predominantly in the brain, liver, intestine and pyloric caeca. Expression of the fasd 2 b in yeast generated a protein that was found to specifically convert eicosatetraenoic acid (20 : 4 n- 3) to eicosapentaenoic acid (20 : 5 n- 3), and therefore functioned as a Δ 5 desaturase. Therefore, rainbow trout have two <b>fads</b> 2 genes that encode proteins with Δ 5 and Δ 6 desaturase activities, respectively, which enable this species to perform all the desaturation steps required for the biosynthesis of LC-PUFA from C 18 precursors...|$|R

40|$|Tropical tuna {{are known}} to {{associate}} with floating objects.

The high probability of finding tuna around <b>FADs</b> {{may be the result of}} an aggregation process (high density of fish because fish stay for a long time around <b>FADs)</b> as well as an attraction process (high flow of fish through <b>FADs).</b> We analysed the movements of 14 yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares, in relation to <b>FADs</b> moored in the Indian and Pacific Oceans (corresponding to all the published tracking data) to determine whether the observed movement patterns resulted from an aggregation or an attraction process. Tuna appeared to be attracted by <b>FADs.</b> In general, they did not stay for long close to the <b>FADs</b> reached, and so did not aggregate there.

40|$|Because {{tropical}} tunas {{are known}} to aggregate around floating objects, {{it has been suggested}} that the large number of drifting fish aggregating devices (FADS) built and deployed by purse seiners could act as an 'ecological trap'. This hypothesis states that these networks of drifting FADS could take fish to areas where they would not normally go or retain them in places that they would otherwise leave. Because the ecological trap hypothesis was first advanced for drifting <b>FADs,</b> some have argued that only studies using drifting <b>FADs</b> can test this hypothesis. However, because working with drifting <b>FADs</b> is difficult, accepting this precept would preclude the scientific community from providing urgently needed information to organizations charged with management of fisheries that exploit drifting <b>FADs.</b> We argue that because both anchored and drifting <b>FADs</b> alter the natural environment, the more easily accessible anchored <b>FADs</b> can be used to test the ecological trap hypothesis. Also, based on a comparative scientific approach, we argue that understanding the behaviour of tunas around anchored <b>FADs</b> can improve our general understanding of tunas around all types of floating objects and help design new, well focused studies for drifting <b>FADs.</b> As anchored <b>FADs</b> are easier to access and offer a greater potential for research, we encourage scientists to design and conduct studies (in particular on the behaviour of fish at FADS) around the moored structures...|$|R

This work reports on the cloning, tissue expression and functional characterization of the Eurasian perch <b>fads</b> 2, but also on the cloning of two alternative splicing transcripts named <b>fads</b> 2 -AS 1 and <b>fads</b> 2 -AS 2.
