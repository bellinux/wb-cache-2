5|$|From a {{historical}} perspective, however, Robertson's most important contribution was made {{not on a}} basketball court, but rather {{in a court of}} law. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> of the landmark Robertson v. National Basketball Ass'n, an antitrust suit filed by the NBA's Players Association against the league. As Robertson was the president of the Players Association, the case bore his name. In this suit, the proposed merger between the NBA and American Basketball Association was delayed until 1976, and the college draft as well as the free agency clauses were reformed. Robertson himself stated that the main reason was that clubs basically owned their players: players were forbidden to talk to other clubs once their contract was up, because free agency did not exist back then. Six years after the suit was filed, the NBA finally reached a settlement, the ABA–NBA merger took place, and the Oscar Robertson suit encouraged signing of more free agents and eventually led to higher salaries for all players.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, Laudrup {{completed}} a controversial move from Barça to Real Madrid after he fell-out with Johan Cruyff. On this, Laudrup stated {{he did not}} have a hidden agenda. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> before the 1994 FIFA World Cup and according to him, because players usually suffer a drop in performance after such a major international tournament, he correctly predicted that Barcelona would not win major trophies the following season.|$|E

500|$|Why the Arsacid court retroactively chose 247BC as {{the first}} year of the Arsacid era is uncertain. A.D.H. Bivar concludes that this was the year the Seleucids lost control of Parthia to Andragoras, the {{appointed}} satrap who rebelled against them. Hence, Arsaces I [...] "backdated his regnal years" [...] to the moment when Seleucid control over Parthia ceased. However, Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis asserts that this was simply the year Arsaces was made chief of the Parni tribe. Homa Katouzian and Gene Ralph Garthwaite claim <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> Arsaces conquered Parthia and expelled the Seleucid authorities, yet Curtis and Maria Brosius state that Andragoras was not overthrown by the Arsacids until 238BC.|$|E

2500|$|... "One {{could feel}} the winds of change" [...] in 1983 Argentina. A cliché perhaps, but at no time more {{appropriately}} used. Everything was optimism about the future, the country, and music. Even technology cooperated with the palpable change: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> the compact disc was introduced. And 1984 was the year of female rock: Patricia Sosa and her heavy rock band La Torre were voted best band {{of the year and}} [...] "Solo quiero Rock and Roll" [...] best single, a first for a female lead rock act. Another female-fronted band, Los Twist, and their superbly catchy tunes about nothing were also doing very well, but the group suffered a blow when Fabiana Cantilo left.|$|E

The Commodores had a stout freshman team the year before, and had just won its third Southern title in a row.

Bomar played halfback this year, and was expected to receive All-American honors at that position by season's end.

The months July and August, named after Julius and Augustus Caesar, are now Nasser and Hannibal respectively." [...] Reflecting on a 2001 visit to the country, American reporter Neil MacFarquhar observed, [...] "Life in Libya was so unpredictable that people weren't even sure what year <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>The</b> <b>year</b> of my visit was officially 1369.

It was a Rob Reiner film about a princess and a prince. The song was about the same subject matter as the film, so we submitted it to Reiner and he loved it.
