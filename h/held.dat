5|$|Alpine {{skiing in}} the Holmenkollen Ski Festival was contested as a {{combined}} event, originally with slalom in Rødkleiva and downhill in Norefjell. Named the Holmenkollen Kandahar, it was inaugurated in 1947. The event was <b>held</b> in Rødkleiva in 1947–48, 1950–51, 1953, 1957–58, and 1960–63. From 1972 the slalom event was <b>held</b> at Kirkerudbakken in Bærum the {{years it was}} in the Oslo area and from 1977 it was <b>held</b> in Wyllerløypa when <b>held</b> in the Oslo area.

5|$|Although {{competitions}} are {{no longer}} <b>held</b> outdoors, the most important competitions (Olympics, World Championships, World Cups) are still scheduled for the Northern Hemisphere summer season because they are combined with outdoor events.

Most of these competitions are multi-day events <b>held</b> together with air rifle matches.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the title}} is a World Tag Team Championship, {{supposedly}} only intended for tag teams, three different wrestlers have <b>held</b> the championship by themselves—Samoa Joe, Kurt Angle and Matt Morgan.

Overall, there have been 43 reigns shared between 38 wrestlers and 27 teams. The current champions are LAX (Ortiz and Santana).|$|E

5|$|As {{attendance}} at ISMB {{grew in the}} late 1990s, several satellite meetings and special interest group (SIG) meetings formed alongside the main conference. SIG meetings are <b>held</b> over {{one or two days}} before the main conference and focus on a specific topic, allowing more detailed discussion than there would be time for in the main conference. Notable SIG meetings include the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC), which has been <b>held</b> annually since 2000 and Bio-Ontologies, which has been <b>held</b> annually since 1998. Satellite meetings are usually two days long and are <b>held</b> in conjunction with ISMB. The 12th CAMDA conference and the 9th 3DSIG meeting were <b>held</b> as satellite meetings of ISMB/ECCB 2013.|$|E

5|$|Basset's lands did {{not form}} a compact estate, {{as they were}} spread over 11 counties. In 1135, Basset's lands totalled 184.25 carucates of land, and were later {{considered}} 15 knight's fees. In Leicestershire, Basset <b>held</b> most of the lands <b>held</b> by Robert de Buci {{at the time of}} the Domesday Survey of 1086. The lands were <b>held</b> by Basset of the king by right of his wife, but how the lands had passed into her family is unclear. In addition, Basset <b>held</b> land in Leicestershire from both King David I of Scotland and from Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester.|$|E

5|$|Basset's {{rewards for}} his royal service {{included}} {{a number of}} manors. Basset was granted the manor of Mixbury by the king, after the family that <b>held</b> {{it at the time}} of Domesday Book died out and it escheated to the king. Other lands <b>held</b> by Basset were probably royal rewards also. One was Quiddenham, which had been <b>held</b> in 1086 by crown. Another was Stoney Stanton, originally <b>held</b> in 1086 by Robert Despenser.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp {{probably}} <b>held</b> {{the office}} of royal forester for Worcestershire as well as sheriff. The evidence {{for this is that}} after Beauchamp's death, his son William was granted the revenues from the royal forests of Worcestershire {{at the same rate as}} his father had <b>held</b> them; this strongly implies that the elder <b>held</b> {{the office of}} forester. The historian Judith Green felt that Walter de Beauchamp might possibly have <b>held</b> the office of constable, which had been <b>held</b> by his father-in-law, although the historian C. Warren Hollister felt that Beauchamp definitely did hold the office. He also a <b>held</b> the royal office of dispenser, an office which later became known as a butler. He acquired this because his wife inherited the office from her father. The date when he acquired the office is unknown. While a member of the royal household, Beauchamp witnessed a number of royal charters, mainly when the king was in England.|$|E

Winterfest was first <b>held</b> in 2009 and centers around the town's rich ice skating and ice hockey traditions. Winterfest events are <b>held</b> all over Bowling Green. Many of the on campus events are <b>held</b> at the BGSU Ice Arena, including curling, skating, BGSU ice hockey and figure skating exhibitions.|$|E
5|$|Burchard <b>held</b> a prebend in {{the cathedral}} chapter of York, {{although}} the exact prebend that he <b>held</b> is unknown. He then <b>held</b> the office of archdeacon for the East Riding, which he <b>held</b> along with the archdeaconry of Durham; all known mentions of his archdeaconry of the East Riding also call him archdeacon of Durham. He acquired the Durham archdeaconry before 24 May 1172, when he first appears holding the office, and <b>held</b> it until his death. Burchard also <b>held</b> a number of churches, including those at Heighington Alne, and Aycliffe. Hugh {{is thought to have}} wanted the archbishopric of York for Burchard, most notably in 1189.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the success}} of the Winter Classic and its predecessor, outdoor games have been <b>held</b> during {{subsequent}} seasons, and the Winter Classic has become an annual NHL tradition. The next Winter Classic was <b>held</b> on January 1, 2009, at Wrigley Field in Chicago, matching the Detroit Red Wings against the Chicago Blackhawks. Winter Classics have been <b>held</b> in every year since, except for 2013, which was interrupted by the 2012–2013 NHL lockout. Three Heritage Classics, one in 2011, one in 2014, and one in 2016 have been <b>held</b> since. The league expanded its offerings of outdoor games with the introduction of the NHL Stadium Series in 2014.
