The paper examines whether other mathematical functions, such as linear, quadratic and cubic functions, conform to the discounting and compounding processes of individual decision makers. Using subjects familiar with the exponential function discounting formula, this study finds that individuals undervalue the compound <b>interest</b> <b>discounting</b> formula given by the exponential function and overvalue the simple <b>interest</b> <b>discounting</b> formula given by the linear function.

40|$|In an {{investigation}} of banks' loan pricing policies in the United States {{over the past two}} decades, this study finds supporting evidence for the bank risk-taking channel of monetary policy. We show that banks charge lower spreads when they lend to riskier borrowers relative to the spreads they charge on loans to safer borrowers in periods of low short-term rates compared to periods of high short-term rates. The <b>interest</b> <b>discount</b> that banks offer riskier borrowers when short-term rates are low is robust to borrower-,loan-, and bank-specific factors as well as to macroeconomic factors known to affect loan rates. The discount is also robust to bank-firm fixed effects.

30|$|The primary {{impediment}} {{to the development}} of renewable energy is the absence of sufficient policies and regulations. Though the Renewable Energy Law has been implemented, from a general view, the procedural law is not detailed and lacks some incentives such as fiscal <b>interest</b> <b>discount</b> policy, preferential tax policy and R&D policy. This is for two main reasons. One is the absence of some corresponding mechanism for the policies, such as incomplete policy to support the development of solar energy, wind energy and biomass energy. The other is the poor coordination of management at all levels, which causes decentralization of funds and redundant construction, so the macro-control ability has been always weak.|$|R

(ii) The majority of Grade Seven pupils show very weak understanding of key mathematical concepts such as number, fraction, place value, perimeter, area, and volume. (iii) The Grade Seven pupils’ levels of competence in the key processes of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are very low especially in problems involving combinations of whole numbers, proper and improper fractions, decimals and mixed numbers.

50|$|The President and CEO of Zellers, Mark Foote, had {{a mandate}} to {{liquidate}} the 273 Zellers stores in preparing it for Target's takeover by October 2011. Foote's strategy was to use a blueprint of a retail liquidation, but without the typical insolvency and desperation that plagued failing chains.

Foote also replaced the expensive fall television ad campaign with a social media blitz on Facebook. Reportedly, the strategy was paying off as Zellers’ operating profit was “well ahead of expectations” and the retailer had “performed very well” in 2011.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the goals}} of {{ecological}} economics is to make a transition to an economy based on qualitative development instead of quantitative growth. In order to achieve this {{it is important to understand}} current factors driving the economy to growth. These factors include the theological belief in growth, biotic potential, fixation on gdp, interest charged on money creation, bank <b>interest,</b> <b>discounting,</b> to provide jobs for labor displaced by productivity improvements, welfare economics defined by consumption, profit motive, materialism, Pareto optimality, and others. All of these factors, their origin, values behind them, and their current usage should be explored in order to devise alternatives to the growth economy. In this article I will explore Pareto optimality, the philosophies of Vilfredo Pareto, their relationship to current economic conditions, and propose some solutions. 2 Pillars of Neo-classical welfare economics The three pillars of neo-classical welfare economics are Homo-economicus; utility maximizing, rational economic man, Perfect competition; independent actions of firms, no market power, constant returns to scale, perfect information, no uncertainty, and Pareto Optimality or Potential-Pareto Optimality (Kaldor-Hicks criteria).

40|$|In this study, we derive an {{analytical}} solution for expected loss {{and the higher}} moment of the discounted loss distribution for a collateralized loan. To ensure nonnegative values for intensity and interest rate, we assume a quadratic Gaussian process for default intensity and <b>discount</b> <b>interest</b> rate. Correlations among default intensity, <b>discount</b> <b>interest</b> rate, and collateral value are represented by correlations among Brownian motions driving {{the movement of the}} Gaussian state variables. Given these assumptions, the expected loss or the m-th moment of the loss distribution is obtained by a time integral of an exponential quadratic form of the state variables. The coefficients of the form are derived by solving ordinary differential equations. In particular, with no correlation between default intensity and <b>discount</b> <b>interest</b> rate, the coefficients have explicit closed form solutions. We show numerical examples to analyze the effects of the correlation between default intensity and collateral value on expected loss and the standard deviation of the loss distribution. default intensity, stochastic recovery, quadratic Gaussian, expected loss, measure change...|$|R
