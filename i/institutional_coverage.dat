40|$|Background: Knowledge of the {{relation}} between health-system factors and child mortality could help to inform health policy in low-income and middle-income countries. We aimed to quantify modifiable health-system factors and their relation with provincial-level heterogeneity in under- 5, infant, and neonatal mortality over time in Mozambique. Methods: Using Demographic and Health Survey (2003 and 2011) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (2008) data, we generated provincial-level time-series of child mortality in under- 5 (ages 0 – 4 years), infant (younger than 1 year), and neonatal (younger than 1 month) age groups for 2000 – 10. We built negative binomial mixed models to examine health-system factors associated with changes in child mortality. Findings: Under- 5 mortality rate was heterogeneous across provinces, with yearly decreases ranging from 11 · 1 % (Nampula) to 1 · 9 % (Maputo Province). Heterogeneity was greater for neonatal mortality rate, with only seven of 11 provinces showing significant yearly decreases, ranging from 13 · 6 % (Nampula) to 4 · 2 % (Zambezia). Health workforce density (adjusted rate ratio 0 · 94, 95 % CI 0 · 90 – 0 · 98) and maternal and child health nurse density (0 · 96, 0 · 92 – 0 · 99) were both associated with reduced under- 5 mortality rate, as were <b>institutional</b> birth <b>coverage</b> (0 · 94, 0 · 90 – 0 · 98) and government financing per head (0 · 80, 0 · 65 – 0 · 98). Higher population per health facility was associated with increased under- 5 mortality rate (1 · 14, 1 · 02 – 1 · 28). Neonatal mortality rate was most strongly associated with institutional birth attendance, maternal and child nurse density, and overall health workforce density. Infant mortality rate was most strongly associated with institutional birth attendance and population per health facility. Interpretation: The large decreases in child mortality seen in Mozambique between 2000 and 2010 could have been partly caused by improvements in the public-sector health workforce, <b>institutional</b> birth <b>coverage,</b> and government health financing. Increased attention should be paid to service availability, because population per health facility is increasing across Mozambique and is associated with increased under- 5 mortality.

As these efforts progress, there are concerns regarding how private delivery care may effect maternal health outcomes. Currently available data do not allow for an in-depth study of the direct effect of increasing private sector use on maternal health across countries.

40|$|CONTEXT: Although <b>institutional</b> <b>coverage</b> of {{childbirth}} {{is increasing}} {{in the developing}} world, a substantial minority of births in rural Mozambique still occur outside of health facilities. Identifying the remaining barriers to safe professional delivery services can aid in achieving universal coverage. METHODS: Survey data collected in 2009 from 1, 373 women in Gaza, Mozambique, were used in combination with spatial, meteorological and health facility data to examine patterns in place of delivery. Geographic information system–based visualization and mapping and exploratory spatial data analysis were used to outline the spatial distribution of home deliveries. Multilevel logistic regression models were constructed to identify associations between individual, spatial and other characteristics and whether women's most recent delivery took place at home. RESULTS: Spatial analysis revealed high- and low-prevalence clusters of home births. In multivariate analyses, women with a higher number of clinics within 10 kilometers of their home had a reduced likelihood of home delivery, but those living closer to urban centers had an increased likelihood. Giving birth during the rainy, high agricultural season was positively associated with home delivery, while household wealth was negatively associated with home birth. No associations were evident for measures of exposure to and experience with health institutions. CONCLUSIONS: The results {{suggest the need for}} a comprehensive approach to expansion of professional delivery services. Such an approach should complement measures facilitating physical access to health institutions for residents of harder-to-reach areas with community-based interventions aimed at improving rural women's living conditions and opportunities, while also taking into account seasonal and other variables...|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the government sector gained prominence after the World War II as the Keynesian theory attributed the government sector key importance in battling economic cycle and the post-war reconstruction and development involved state interventions on a large scale. In 1990 s a strength-ened interest in the government sector was triggered {{by the need to}} coordinate fiscal policies and closely monitor fiscal health in the countries forming the Economic and Monetary Union. Finally, {{in the context of the}} recent global economic crisis, the government sector returned to the centre of the economic policy debate as fiscal policy was used as a main tool to fight the economic recession and subsequently sustainability of government finances became a pressing issue for many countries around the Globe. Increasing importance of the fiscal analysis and fiscal policymaking always generated and continues to generate demand for appropriate statistical data. The international statistical standards played a key role in meeting these requirements. This dissertation offers a comprehensive historical overview, a comparative analysis and evaluation of main internationally recognised statistical standards dealing with the government sector produced by the United Nations, the OECD, the European Communities (Eurostat), the IMF and the European Central Bank. It covers a period since the first international guidelines in late 1940 s up to present. It analyses evolution of the statistical treatment of the government sector including its historical roots and gradual revisions and extensions to reflect changing needs and shifts in economic environment. The study compares individual standards with each other and across time and points out differences in basic definitions, concepts and classifications, the <b>institutional</b> <b>coverage</b> of the government sector, structure of government accounts and balancing items, integration of flow accounts with balance sheets and consolidation of transactions or stocks. The dissertation shows that the international statistical standards were successful in offering common statistical guidance, recommendations and best practices. The international organizations have proven to be well suited to deliver widely acknowledged standards. Their cooperation with national statistical agencies and engagement of the most competent experts in the field contributed to building credibility of these statistical systems, if properly applied. The comparative analysis also demonstrates a clear long-term effort of the international statistical community to enhance international harmonization. The application of the international statistical standards also improved quality and availability of government statistics as individual countries are in principle bound [...] through their memberships in the international organizations [...] to compile agreed data on the basis of a common methodology. This was in particular the case for EU countries for which provision of statistical data according to a given standard is legally binding, as the data are relevant for budgetary and surveillance procedures.

40|$|The {{governmental}} {{structure of}} Hawaii through which its water-related agencies operate {{is a relatively}} simple one as {{compared to that of}} most other mainland states. A highly centralized state government dominates over one layer of four county-level governments (in the case of Honolulu, the City &County of Honolulu). Each of these four local governments has its own charter which is similar in most respects to the others, but, nevertheless, uniquely applicable to itself. County boundaries are conveniently contiguous with the natural geographic boundaries of each island except for the tri-islands county of Maui (Maui, Molokai, and Lanai). Besides the four island counties, the only other local-level governmental entity is the Soil and Water Conservation District. There are some l 5 of these SWCD's covering about 96 percent of the land area in the state. They, however, do not possess any taxing or regulatory powers and for administrative purposes they are closely associated with the State Department of Land and Natural Resources. While it is generally conceded that Hawaii has a relatively simple governmental structure, there are nevertheless a considerable number of public water-related agencies that has evolved over time. Some 50 odd agencies have been conveniently categorized under federal, state, and local agencies. While not all the higher level agencies in the federal category such as, the Water Resources Council, the Council of Environmental Quality, the National Water Commission, and the Office of Management and Budget, are physically represented in Hawaii, they still have important bearings on the water policies and programs of the state and so have been usefully considered along with those situated in the islands. Despite this broadened scope, the <b>institutional</b> <b>coverage</b> in this report is still somewhat limited by the fact that, except for the three quasi-public companies, which come under the purview of the State Public Utilities Commission, only public agencies were surveyed. Also, since the agencies are for the most part entities of the executive branch of the government, the roles of the legislative and judicial branches are likewise not adequately reflected. These public water-related agencies may then be regarded as only a portion of a complex institutional superstructure that functions in the water economy of Hawaii. Conceptually, this institutional superstructure is just {{as much a part of}} the total water resources system in Hawaii as the physical sub-system itself. From a social viewpoint, the physical sub-system exists for the ultimate benefit of mankind who has, through experience in conflicts, systematically developed the necessary institutions to facilitate orderly development and use of his naturally endowed water resources. In this sense, both the physical and institutional sub-systems make up the total integrated water resources system of the state. OWRR PROJECT NO.

40|$|Multi-hop {{wireless}} mesh {{networks have}} emerged as an accepted communication paradigm over the last decade, although their performance is yet to reach to its full potential. Different applications of these networks, such as large-scale metropolitan wireless communication, <b>institutional</b> <b>coverage,</b> battlefield connectivity, etc., often demand highly optimized network performance. To address this issue, this dissertation addresses the problem of performance optimization in multi-hop wireless mesh networks. ^ We maneuver our study on the performance optimization through focusing on different layers in the protocol stack. First, we start at the network layer. We design an energy-efficient network architecture to support high-data-rate applications over low-power wireless meshes, i. e., wireless sensor networks. Here, we study the notion of deploying a high-power radio, 802. 11, to augment the network having only conventionally used low-power 802. 15. 4 radio such that we can guarantee improving the overall energy-efficiency of the network. To achieve the goal, we separately investigate network-level energy efficiencies of both the radios, and then propose the energy-efficient architecture exploiting {{the findings of the}} investigation. Our proposed architecture utilizes a delicate balance between the power consumptions of both the radios, which we determine using a cross-layer mathematical model. A real testbed implementation reveals that the proposed network architecture significantly improves the overall energy efficiency of a low-power wireless mesh. ^ Next, we study performance optimization at the transport layer. Here, we specifically focus on reliable data transmission at the transport layer. Our first contribution in this case is based on the observation that the performance of reliable data transmission protocols, such as TCP, depends on the dynamic adjustment of a parameter called retransmission timeout, which in turn depends on the dynamic estimation of round trip time. We propose a stateful Q-learning based technique to dynamically estimate the round trip time. The proposed technique incurs low overhead, making it particularly suitable for networks of embedded systems such as wireless sensor meshes. Besides, the technique substantially improves network performance, which we validate through simulation and real testbed experiments. In addition, we also study on congestion control over wireless mesh networks as the congestion control mechanisms exhibit a substantial influence on overall network performance. We propose end-to-end congestion control mechanisms for both ad-hoc and infrastructure wireless mesh networks. The mechanism for ad-hoc wireless mesh networks is based on the use of a neural network. Besides, the other mechanism for infrastructure wireless mesh networks is based on the use of a decision theory called multi-armed bandit problem. One of the key advantages of these proposed mechanisms is that neither of them involves any radical changes to TCP. Moreover, simulation results and real testbed experiments demonstrate that the proposed congestion control mechanisms can significantly improve the network performance. ^ Finally, we investigate the performance optimization from the upper layers, i. e., the layers that reside on top of the transport layer. Here, we specifically focus on performance optimization over multi-radio networks. First, we study the notion of splitting data, originated from a single flow, over multiple radios. In the study, we propose to perform the splitting from the application layer, as the splitting vastly depends on specific requirements of the application and the application, itself, best knows its own requirements. Besides, {{we do not have to}} make any change in existing system architectures in the case of the proposed application-layer data splitting. Moreover, the proposed splitting mechanism exploits a prediction model, and thus incurs no overhead in the network. In addition to such splitting, we also study flow-level data splitting. The notion of flow-level splitting exhibits the potential to improve network performance to a great extent in presence of a mix of different types of flows in the network. In the study on flow-level splitting, first, we analyze coherency between characteristics of the different types of flows and attributes of different radios. Then, we propose a mechanism for flow-level data splitting by exploiting the coherency found from our analysis. We evaluate both of our proposed splitting mechanisms through simulation and real testbed experiments, which uncover their potentials to significantly improve network performance. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{countries}} in Latin America and the Caribbean {{have experienced a}} dramatic increase in the levels of higher education enrollment. Using administrative data from Chile and Colombia, we find that this phenomenon is not always associated with higher private individual returns. In both countries, there is a significant dispersion in the net returns to higher education and a significant proportion of graduates could be facing negative returns. This means that, for many higher education graduates, net earnings might have been higher if they had not earned a higher education degree. We hypothesize that while there have been major policy efforts to increase <b>coverage,</b> <b>institutional</b> arrangements that encourage quality and relevance has been insufficient. Corrective measures in this direction are urgent. Sustainable growth requires a labor force with relevant skills and capabilities. In light of our results, {{it is not clear that}} the higher education systems in these countries are delivering these outcomes...|$|R

40|$|With the {{invention}} of Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) and Geohazard computer models, the role of digital elevation model (DEM) has become very important and effective tools in Geohazard modeling. Flood inundation mapping, landslide susceptibility mapping and wind velocity mapping are examples that effectively employ the DEM and its derivatives {{as one of the}} important modeling inputs. On the other hand, satellite based DEMs have been growing rapidly in recent years. There are several sources of DEMs available ranging from very coarse to high resolution which provides geospatial data in different scales. This paper describe the specification and applications of public domain satellite-based DEMs including SRTM and ASTER-GDEM which, are globally free. From several applications, the scope is limited to the application of public domain satellite DEMs in flood potential mapping which is considered a widespread Geohazard. From the result, it was found that several advantages were recognized for public domain satellite–based DEMs including ease of accessibility, elimination of <b>institutional</b> bureaucracy, unlimited <b>coverage,</b> adequate spatial resolution, and more importantly, they are available free of charg...|$|R
