At longer <b>hold</b> requirements, postpause lever <b>holding</b> frequently was interrupted with additional pauses.

40|$|Conflict Alerts for {{aircraft}} in <b>holding</b> patterns are often missed or in error due to fact that <b>holding</b> trajectories are not modeled in Conflict Alert or Conflict Probe logic. In addition, a controller in one sector {{may not know}} when aircraft are <b>holding</b> in a neighboring sector. These factors can lead to an increased potential for loss of separation while aircraft are flying in <b>holding</b> patterns. A <b>holding</b> function for conflict probe applications has been developed and tested with air traffic data from Fort Worth Center. The <b>holding</b> function automatically determines when an aircraft enters a <b>holding</b> pattern, builds a <b>holding</b> region around the pattern and then probes the region for conflict with other traffic. The operational concept of use assumes that air traffic controllers are very busy during periods when aircraft are in <b>holding</b> and therefore don't have time to manually enter information which defines a <b>holding</b> pattern and activates conflict probing. For this reason, it is important the <b>holding</b> function automatically detect aircraft in <b>holding</b> and compute a <b>holding</b> region for conflict analysis.

40|$|Under current National Airspace System {{operations}} conflict alerts {{for aircraft}} in <b>holding</b> patterns are often missed or in error {{due to the}} fact that trajectories for <b>holding</b> aircraft are not modeled in existing Conflict Alert or Conflict Probe automation. In addition, a controller in one sector may not know when aircraft are <b>holding</b> in a neighboring sector.

The objective of this work is to develop a <b>holding</b> function that automatically determines when an aircraft enters a <b>holding</b> pattern, computes a <b>holding</b> region around the pattern, and probes the <b>holding</b> region for conflict with other traffic. Since controller workload is generally high during periods when aircraft are in <b>holding</b> the operational concept of use assumes the <b>holding</b> region is automatically computed and the controller is alerted only if another aircraft is predicted to fly through the <b>holding</b> region.
