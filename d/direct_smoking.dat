50|$|The {{application}} of liquid smoke to food {{has grown to}} encompass {{a wide variety of}} methods employing thousands of commercial formulations worldwide. By far the widest use of liquid smoke is for the purpose of replacing <b>direct</b> <b>smoking</b> of food with onsite-generated smoke from wood. To impart the desired functional effects of smoke, liquid smoke preparations must be applied topically. In addition to flavor, reaction color, anti-microbial, and texture effects are the functionalities that can only be obtained by topical addition followed by thermal processing. Dipping products in diluted solutions or soaking them in brines containing liquid smoke followed by heating was done long before the modern industrial era using Wright’s liquid smoke and pyroligneous acid precursors. Allen patented a method of regenerating smoke using air atomization. It remains the leading technology for using condensed smoke products to treat processed meat, cheese, fish, and other foods in batch smokehouses. As the meat-processing industry has consolidated, continuous processes have evolved and direct applications of solutions of liquid smoke via showering or drenching systems installed on continuous lines have grown to be the largest type of application method. In North America there are more than thirty-five processed-meat plants utilizing bulk tanks to receive tankers of liquid smoke for topical application as an alternative to direct wood smoking. Also noteworthy is the method of topical application by impregnation of fibrous, laminated, and plastic casings. Meat products are subsequently stuffed into these casings and thermally processed. The use of natural condensed smoke preparations internally in food is another important means of imparting smoke flavor. It is used when other technical functions of smoke are not imperative to be expressed in a finished food. This can be done directly by adding into blenders with meat or other foods or injecting whole muscle meat. Incorporation into sauces such as barbeque or dry seasonings and compounding with other flavors are other important ways in which the flavors are used. Further utility of aqueous smoke solutions is gained by the use of more complex food-grade processing such as extraction into oil, spray drying using maltodextrin carriers, or plating onto foods and food ingredients such as malt flour, yeast, or salt.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effect of added fat (20 % and 40 %), casing type (hog and collagen) and smoking procedures (direct and indirect exposure) on the 16 EPA priority PAHs in dry fermented sausages manufactured according traditional processing. The total PAHs content (sum of 16 PAHs) found in whole product (casing included) varied between 150 and 870 lg kg 1, with more than 99 % of this content corresponding to harmless low molecular weight compounds. Concerning benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) and PAH 4, the respective maximum contents (0. 32 and 10. 35 lg kg 1, respectively) did not exceed the imposed limits regulated by the European Union. According to our results, casing type was the most influential factor. For hog samples, fat content and smoking regime alone did not influenced the total PAHs amount. However, significantly higher (p < 0. 05) contamination levels were detected in hog casing samples combining high fat content and <b>direct</b> <b>smoking</b> procedures.

40|$|Abstract Background Exposure to {{environmental}} tobacco smoke (ETS), which contains potent respiratory irritants, may lead to chronic airway inflammation and obstruction. Although ETS exposure appears to cause asthma in children and adults, its role in causing COPD has received limited attention in epidemiologic studies. Methods Using data from a population-based sample of 2, 113 U. S. adults aged 55 to 75 years, we examined the association between lifetime ETS exposure {{and the risk of}} developing COPD. Participants were recruited from all 48 contiguous U. S. states by random digit dialing. Lifetime ETS exposure was ascertained by structured telephone interview. We used a standard epidemiologic approach to define COPD based on a self-reported physician diagnosis of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or COPD. Results Higher cumulative lifetime home and work exposure were associated with a greater risk of COPD. The highest quartile of lifetime home ETS exposure was associated with a greater risk of COPD, controlling for age, sex, race, personal smoking history, educational attainment, marital status, and occupational exposure to vapors, gas, dusts, or fumes during the longest held job (OR 1. 55; 95 % CI 1. 09 to 2. 21). The highest quartile of lifetime workplace ETS exposure was also related to a greater risk of COPD (OR 1. 36; 95 % CI 1. 002 to 1. 84). The population attributable fraction was 11 % for the highest quartile of home ETS exposure and 7 % for work exposure. Conclusion ETS exposure may be an important cause of COPD. Consequently, public policies aimed at preventing public smoking may reduce the burden of COPD-related death and disability, both by reducing <b>direct</b> <b>smoking</b> and ETS exposure. </p...|$|E
40|$|Maternal smoking during {{pregnancy}} {{can result in}} both pregnancy complications and reduced size of the fetus and neonate. Among women who smoke, genetic susceptibility to tobacco smoke also is a likely causative factor in adverse pregnancy outcomes. A prospective cohort study was conducted among 460 pregnant women who delivered live singletons in Sapporo, Japan, from 2002 to 2005. Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate associations of maternal smoking and polymorphisms in two genes encoding N-nitrosamine-metabolizing enzymes—NAD(P) H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO 1) and cytochrome P- 450 2 E 1 (CYP 2 E 1) —with birth size. Among infants born to smokers with the NQO 1 homozygous wild-type allele, birth weight, birth length, and birth head circumference were significantly reduced (p < 0. 01 for each factor). For the homozygous wild-type CYP 2 E 1 allele, birth weight was lower by an estimated 195 g (standard error, 55; p < 0. 001) among smokers. These genotypes did not confer adverse effects among women who had never smoked or who quit smoking during the first trimester. The adverse effects of maternal smoking on infant birth size may be modified by maternal genetic polymorphisms in N-nitrosamine-metabolizing enzymes among Japanese subjects. These results may help in <b>directing</b> <b>smoking</b> cessation interventions {{during pregnancy}}, especially among susceptible women. birth weight; cytochrome P- 450 CYP 2 E 1; fetal development; nitrosamines; NQO 1 protein, human; pregnancy...|$|R

40|$|Cigarette smoking, one of {{the most}} {{pervasive}} habits in society, presents many well established health risks. While lung cancer is probably the most common and well documented disease associated with tobacco exposure, it is becoming clear from recent research that many other diseases are causally related to smoking. Whether from <b>direct</b> <b>smoking</b> or inhaling environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), termed secondhand smoke, the cells of the respiratory tissues and the lining pulmonary surfactant are the first body tissues to be directly exposed to the many thousands of toxic chemicals in tobacco. Considering the vast surface area of the lung and the extreme attenuation of the blood-air barrier, {{it is not surprising that}} this organ is the primary route for exposure, not just to smoke but to most environmental contaminants. Recent research has shown that the pulmonary surfactant, a complex mixture of phospholipids and proteins, is the first site of defense against particulates or gas components of smoke. However, it is not clear what effect smoke has on the surfactant. Most studies have demonstrated that smoking reduces bronchoalveolar lavage phospholipid levels. Some components of smoke also appear to have a direct detergent-like effect on the surfactant while others appear to alter cycling or secretion. Ultimately these effects are reflected in changes in the dynamics of the surfactant system and, clinically in changes in lung mechanics. Similarly, exposure of the developing fetal lung through maternal smoking results in postnatal alterations in lung mechanics and higher incidents of wheezing and coughing. Direct exposure of developing lung to nicotine induces changes suggestive of fetal stress. Furthermore, identification of nicotinic receptors in fetal lung airways and corresponding increases in airway connective tissue support a possible involvement of nicotine in postnatal asthma development. Finally, at the level of the alveoli of the lung, colocalization of nicotinic receptors and surfactant-specific protein in alveolar cells is suggestive of a role in surfactant metabolism. Further research is needed to determine the mechanistic effects of smoke and its components on surfactant function and, importantly, the effects of smoke components on the developing pulmonary system...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{epidemiologic}} studies have observed {{an association between}} secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure and pediatric invasive bacterial disease (IBD) but the evidence has not been systematically reviewed. We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of SHS exposure and two outcomes, IBD and pharyngeal carriage of bacteria, for Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis), Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae). Two independent reviewers searched Medline, EMBASE, and selected other databases, and screened articles for inclusion and exclusion criteria. We identified 30 case-control studies on SHS and IBD, and 12 cross-sectional studies on SHS and bacterial carriage. Weighted summary odd ratios (ORs) were calculated for each outcome and for studies with specific design and quality characteristics. Tests for heterogeneity and publication bias were performed. Compared with those unexposed to SHS, summary OR for SHS exposure was 2. 02 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 52 - 2. 69) for invasive meningococcal disease, 1. 21 (95 % CI 0. 69 - 2. 14) for invasive pneumococcal disease, and 1. 22 (95 % CI 0. 93 - 1. 62) for invasive Hib disease. For pharyngeal carriage, summary OR was 1. 68 (95 % CI, 1. 19 - 2. 36) for N. meningitidis, 1. 66 (95 % CI 1. 33 - 2. 07) for S. pneumoniae, and 0. 96 (95 % CI 0. 48 - 1. 95) for Hib. The association between SHS exposure and invasive meningococcal and Hib diseases was consistent regardless of outcome definitions, age groups, study designs, and publication year. The effect estimates were larger in studies among children younger than 6 years of age for all three IBDs, and in studies with the more rigorous laboratory-confirmed diagnosis for invasive meningococcal disease (summary OR 3. 24; 95 % CI 1. 72 - 6. 13). When considered together with evidence from <b>direct</b> <b>smoking</b> and biological mechanisms, our systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that SHS exposure {{may be associated with}} invasive meningococcal disease. The epidemiologic evidence is currently insufficient to show an association between SHS and invasive Hib disease or pneumococcal disease.

This study aimed to explore the feasibility of a telephone-based direct-marketing approach to delivering cessation strategies. Design, setting, measurements and participants: A community survey was conducted to explore the views of current adult smokers regarding the acceptability, likely uptake and barriers to uptake of smoking cessation services offered by direct telephone marketing. Findings: Three quarters (73. 8 %) of smokers contacted agreed to be surveyed. Of the 194 study participants, 75. 3 % reported that they would utilize vouchers for discount nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), 66. 5 % would use a mailed self-help booklet, 57. 2 % would take up the offer of regular mailings of personalized letters and self-help materials and 46. 4 % would utilize a ‘we-call-you’ telephone counselling service.

40|$|Smoking {{and tobacco}} {{exposure}} are events that only secondarily produce harmful physical effects. There {{is evidence that}} cigarette smoking is related to some adverse perinatal outcomes, however {{it is not just}} active smoking that plays a role [1]. This problem has at least three facets related to the deleterious effect associated with the fetus and newborn: (1) <b>direct</b> cigarette <b>smoking</b> during pregnancy; (2) the effect of environmental cigarette smoke (second-hand, passive smoking); and (3) the effect of smoking while breastfeeding. Nicotine from cigarettes reduces the blood flow from the uterus to the placenta, decreasing the flow of blood to the baby and thus injuring the baby’s brain. Every cigarette a pregnant woman has increases the level of carbon monoxide in her bloodstream, which replaces oxygen in her blood, so the amount of available oxygen through the umbilical cord is reduced [2]. Also, the majority of pulmonary parameters are lowered in smokers that have implications on the overall blood oxygen supply [3]. Maternal exposure to cigarette smoke is associated with a doubled risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), in which infants starve for oxygen.
