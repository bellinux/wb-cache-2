5|$|Several major {{weaknesses}} in Akagis design were not rectified. Akagis aviation fuel tanks were incorporated {{directly into the}} structure of the carrier, meaning that shocks to the ship, such as those caused by bomb or shell hits, would be transmitted directly to the tanks, resulting in cracks or leaks. Also, the fully enclosed structure of the new hangar <b>decks</b> made firefighting difficult, at least in part because fuel vapors could accumulate in the hangars. Adding to the danger was the requirement of the Japanese carrier doctrine that aircraft be serviced, fueled, and armed whenever possible on the hangar <b>decks</b> rather than on the flight deck. Furthermore, the carrier's hangar and flight <b>decks</b> carried little armor protection, and there was no redundancy in the ship's fire-extinguishing systems. These weaknesses would later be crucial factors in the loss of the ship.|$|E
5|$|The castles of the Mary Rose had {{additional}} <b>decks,</b> {{but since}} virtually nothing of them survives, their design {{has had to}} be reconstructed from historical records.

5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G <b>decks,</b> was at the extreme ends of the <b>decks,</b> and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper <b>decks</b> and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E

50|$|If {{a learner}} is {{successful}} at a card from <b>Deck</b> Current, it gets transferred into the progress <b>deck</b> {{that begins with}} that session's number. (For example, success at a card during Session 6 transfers it from <b>Deck</b> Current to <b>Deck</b> 6-8-1-5.) Cards from that <b>deck</b> are reviewed whenever a number from the <b>deck</b> title matches the session number. (For example, cards from <b>Deck</b> 6-8-1-5 will be reviewed again at Sessions 8, 1, and 5.) If a learner has difficulty with a card during a subsequent review, the card is returned to <b>Deck</b> Current; otherwise it stays in its progress <b>deck.</b> When a learner is successful at a card during a session that matches the last number on the <b>deck</b> (for example, Session 5 for <b>Deck</b> 6-8-1-5), that card goes into <b>Deck</b> Retired, and the title card for that progress <b>deck</b> is freed up for use at the following session.|$|R

5|$|Kronan {{was one of}} {{the most}} heavily armed {{warships}} in the world in 1672 when she was launched, a three-decker with 110 guns. The ship had three full gundecks with guns from bow to stern. Altogether there were seven separate levels, divided by six <b>decks.</b> Furthest down in the ship, above the keel, was the hold, and immediately above it, but still below the waterline, lay the orlop; both were used primarily for storage. Above the orlop were the three gundecks, two of them covered, while about half of the topmost gundeck was open to the elements in the ship's middle, or waist. The bow had one deck, making up the forecastle, and the stern had two <b>decks,</b> including a poop deck.|$|E

Twenty-one of the ship's aviators were killed. The loss of Kaga and the three other IJN carriers at Midway (Hiryū was also sunk during the battle), with their aircraft and veteran pilots, was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to Japan's ultimate defeat in the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} of Akagi began on 19 November 1923, and {{was completed in}} March 1927. However, the strange assortment of flight <b>decks</b> fitted on Akagi—a main landing deck superimposed over two short take-off decks—proved unsatisfactory, and the ship was withdrawn from active service in 1935 for modernization. The lower two flight <b>decks</b> were removed, the main deck was lengthened to , and a third elevator was added. Refitting was completed in 1938. Akagi supported operations off China in early 1939 and 1940, and underwent an overhaul in November 1940.|$|E

5|$|The few {{aircraft}} on the Japanese flight <b>decks</b> at {{the time}} of the attack were either defensive fighters or, in the case of Sōryū, fighters being spotted to augment the Combat Air Patrol. Spotting his flight <b>decks</b> and launching aircraft would have required at least 30 minutes. Furthermore, by spotting and launching immediately, Nagumo would be committing some of his reserve to battle without proper anti-ship armament; he had just witnessed how easily unescorted American bombers had been shot down. Poor discipline caused many of the Japanese bombers to ditch their bombs and attempt to dogfight intercepting F4Fs.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{official}} armament plan Kronan was to be equipped with 124–126guns; 34–36guns {{on each of the}} gundecks and an additional 18 shared between forecastle and sterncastle <b>decks.</b> Guns were classed by the weight of the cannonballs they fired, varying between 3 and 36pounds (1.3–15.3kg). The guns themselves weighed from a few hundred kg (400–500lbs) up to four tonnes (4.4 tons) with the heaviest pieces placed {{in the middle of the}} lower-most gundeck with successively lighter ones on the <b>decks</b> above. Kronans most lethal weapons were the 30- and 36-pounders on the lowest gundeck which had a range and firepower that outclassed the armament of almost any other warship. The guns lighter than 18-pounders were primarily intended to inflict damage on the enemy's crew and rigging rather than the hull.|$|E
5|$|After Point Grey and Point Orient {{were turned}} over to the RVN on 14 July only Point Cypress and Point Marone were left in Division 13. On that day the {{remaining}} two cutters were given orders to report to the lower Mekong Delta and provide support for operations in the Than Phu Secret Zone. On 19 and 20 July the crews of both cutters consisted of a full complement of 13 RVN sailors and 5 Coast Guardsmen including the commanding officers. Kit Carson Scouts were also embarked, making the <b>decks</b> very crowded. The Scouts were put ashore on a search and destroy mission and the cutters backed them up with gunfire from their <b>decks</b> and the cutter small boats. The raid was successful, netting several captured Viet Cong troops and boxes of documents. A week later both cutters with Australian Army explosive ordnance disposal soldiers aboard cruised the My Thanh River and destroyed fortifications.|$|E
5|$|At 02:45, Amethyst {{was able}} to pull across the bows of Niémen, inflicting a devastating raking fire on the French ship which caused terrible damage.

The frigates were so close that shot from Amethyst started fires among Niémens hammock netting, placed along the <b>decks</b> to deter boarding actions. At 03:15, Niémens mizenmast and main topmast collapsed and another fire {{broke out in the}} main top, but Amethyst was also severely damaged and at 03:30 her mainmast fell onto the deck from a combination of shot damage and stress in high winds.
