40|$|Bibliography: pages 89 - 92. The {{scheduling}} {{of production}} in <b>job</b> <b>shops</b> is generally accomplished in four stages; aggregate planning, machine loading, sequencing and detailed scheduling. In industrial <b>job</b> <b>shops,</b> {{the number of}} jobs and machines makes detailed scheduling a particularly complicated and unwieldy task. When faced with this situation, a typical response of managements is to simply ignore the problem and apply some remedial action by adapting existing company operation procedures. The first objective of this dissertation is to indicate the dangers and inefficiencies which result when the problem of detailed scheduling is ignored. This is done in terms of a case study analysis in which the problems which currently exist in the machine shop at Atlantis Aluminium, a jobbing foundry, are illustrated. The second objective is to develop a systematic approach for the solution of detailed scheduling in <b>job</b> <b>shops.</b> Major steps in this approach are: i) a classification of shop scheduling problems ii) a survey of relevant scheduling literature in order to determine existing detailed scheduling techniques iii) the design of the scheduling system This approach is illustrated by applying it to the machine shop at Atlantis Aluminium...|$|R
40|$|Setting short yet {{reliable}} Due Dates (DDs) is {{an important}} early production planning and control task. The majority of job-shop research on DD setting assumes simple product structures without assembly operations. However, in practice, product structures are often complex, and multiple final assembly operations may be required. This paper evaluates the performance of DD setting rules {{in the context of}} complex product structures, considering two scenarios: two-level assembly <b>job</b> <b>shops,</b> where orders converge on one final assembly operation; and two-level multi-stage <b>job</b> <b>shops,</b> where a series of assembly operations are undertaken. New rules are proposed which are substantially simpler and more suitable for practical use than those in the literature. These rules are only outperformed by a more sophisticated rule from the wider literature, newly introduced into the context of assembly and multi-stage <b>job</b> <b>shops.</b> Which rule to apply in practice depends on whether a manager considers the improvement in performance more important than the loss of simplicity. Future research should investigate how jobs can be planned and controlled effectively when some or all DDs are set externally by customers rather than internally using a DD setting rule. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Card-based {{systems are}} simple, {{effective}} means of controlling production. Yet most systems concentrate on controlling the shop floor. They neglect other planning tasks, like estimating short, feasible due dates during customer enquiry management. A card-based version of the workload control concept for <b>job</b> <b>shops</b> – COBACABANA (COntrol of BAlance by CArd-BAsed Navigation) – was proposed in the literature to overcome this shortcoming. COBACABANA uses cards for due date setting and order release, making it a potentially important solution for small shops with limited resources. But many such firms operate as flow <b>shops</b> rather than <b>job</b> <b>shops.</b> Research demonstrated that COBACABANA’s release mechanism must be adapted if applied to a pure flow shop, but its approach to due date setting has not been evaluated in such an environment. We show COBACABANA {{has the potential to}} improve pure flow shop performance, but its due date setting procedure should be adapted compared to <b>job</b> <b>shops.</b> In a flow shop, due date estimation can also be further simplified by considering the load awaiting release to the first (gateway) station only while maintaining most performance benefits. The results are important for all card-based systems that aim to stabilise work-in-process, including kanban and ConWIP (Constant Work-in-Process) ...|$|R

40|$|SMED is {{a method}} {{introduced}} by Shigeo Shingo to reduce setup durations from hours to minutes. The name implies a goal of reducing each setup to less than 10 minutes, so the number of minutes will be expressed by a single digit. SMED has been primarily developed for repetitive manufacturing, and is most beneficial when dealing with recurring setups. In this paper we present the basic theory of SMED and discuss to what extent it is applicable to custom <b>job</b> <b>shops</b> and repair <b>job</b> <b>shops,</b> such as machine shops at naval shipyards. We also present general rules how to prioritize SMED efforts, i. e., which resources should be treated first.

40|$|This {{research}} compares {{a set of}} cross-training policies {{represented by}} different numbers of cross-trained workers, additional skills per cross-trained worker, and additional machines. The policies are evaluated in <b>job</b> <b>shops,</b> represented by different efficiency losses, labour utilization, variability in processing times, and worker absenteeism. Our results show that adding one machine in each department and cross-training one or two workers from each department with one additional skill is generally sufficient to realize most {{of the benefits of}} cross-training. Cross-training is thus beneficial in most <b>job</b> <b>shops,</b> unless the cost of the minimal training and spare machines is high. Our results also show that the value of cross-training and adding machines depends very much on the environment, and it is better to spread cross-training over more workers than to train a few workers with more skills.
