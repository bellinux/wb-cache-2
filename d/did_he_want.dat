5|$|However, Boston's {{chances of}} getting Russell seemed slim. Because the Celtics had {{finished}} second in the previous season and the worst teams had the highest draft picks, the Celtics had slipped too low in the draft order to pick Russell. In addition, Auerbach had already used his territorial pick to acquire talented forward Tom Heinsohn. But Auerbach knew that the Rochester Royals, who owned the first draft pick, already had a skilled rebounder in Maurice Stokes, were looking for an outside shooting guard and were unwilling to pay Russell the $25,000 signing bonus he requested. The St. Louis Hawks, who owned the second pick, drafted Russell, but were vying for Celtics center Ed Macauley, a six-time All-Star who had roots in St. Louis. Auerbach agreed to trade Macauley, who had previously asked to be traded to St. Louis in order to be with his sick son, if the Hawks gave up Russell. The owner of St Louis called Auerbach later and demanded more in the trade. Not only <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> Macauley, who was the Celtics premier player at the time, he wanted Cliff Hagan, who had been serving in the military for three years and had not yet played for the Celtics. After much debate, Auerbach agreed to give up Hagan, and the Hawks made the trade.|$|E

He is, of course, {{primarily}} concerned with facts of linguistic usage. However, some argue that Wittgenstein is basically a behaviorist because he considers facts about language use as all there is. Such a claim is controversial, since it is not explicitly endorsed in the Investigations.|$|E
25|$|However, screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni stated on {{numerous}} occasions that he had written a treatment for a sequel, tentatively titled Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo n. 2 (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly 2). According to Vincenzoni and Eli Wallach, the film would have been set 20 years after the original, and would have followed Tuco pursuing Blondie's grandson for the gold. Clint Eastwood expressed interest in {{taking part in the}} film's production, including acting as narrator. Joe Dante and Leone were also approached to direct and produce the film respectively. Eventually, however, the project was vetoed by Leone, as he did not want the original film's title or characters to be reused, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> to be involved in another Western film.|$|E

Aigler said, [...] "The evidence before the Conference indicated strongly that the Wisconsin regents for several years have shown a disposition to subordinate faculty desires to the wishes of such outsiders."

500|$|Preferring to {{concentrate}} on broad policy matters and speeches, McGovern was not a master of Senate legislative tactics, and developed a reputation among some other senators for [...] "not doing his homework". Described as [...] "a very private, unchummy guy", {{he was not a}} member of the Senate [...] "club" [...] nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> to be, turning down in 1969 a chance to join the powerful Senate Rules Committee. Relatively few pieces of legislation bore his name, and his legislative accomplishments were generally viewed as modest, although he would try to influence the contents of others' bills. In his political beliefs, McGovern fit squarely within modern American liberalism; through 1967 he had voted in accordance with the rated positions of the ADA 92percent of the time, and when lacking specific knowledge on a particular matter, he would ask his staff, [...] "What are the liberals doing?" ...|$|E

500|$|The first {{crisis to}} occur on Conant's watch was the {{uprising}} of 1953 in East Germany. This brought the reunification {{issue to the}} fore. Konrad Adenauer's deft handling of the issue enabled him to handily win re-election as [...] Chancellor of West Germany in September, but this also strengthened his hand in negotiations with Conant. Adenauer did not want his country to become a bargaining chip between the United States and the Soviet Union, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> it to become a nuclear battlefield, a prospect raised {{by the arrival of}} American tactical nuclear weapons in 1953 as part of the Eisenhower administration's New Look policy. Conant lobbied for the European Defense Community, which would have established a pan-European military. This seemed to be the only way that German rearmament would be accepted, but opposition from France killed the plan. In what Conant considered a minor miracle, France's actions cleared the way for West Germany to become part of NATO with its own army.|$|E
500|$|Half-French, half-Puerto Rican Kiele Michelle Sanchez portrayed Nikki in six {{episodes of}} the third season of Lost. She had trouble filming her burial scene due to her claustrophobia. Rodrigo Santoro, who has been called [...] "the Brazilian Tom Cruise" [...] and [...] "the Brazilian Russell Crowe", was cast in his first major American {{television}} role as Paulo on Lost. Appearing {{in a total of}} seven episodes, Santoro was reportedly paid [...] "between $2634 and $6427 a week". Lindelof called Santoro [...] "talented" [...] and [...] "perfect for Lost because he's a face that the American audience is not familiar with", despite being an award-winning actor in his home country of Brazil. Part of the reason Santoro was cast over other actors was because his physique was deemed attractive; however, the writers said that they were not interested in writing for his character with that in mind, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> them to. Santoro has stated he enjoyed working with Sanchez and hoped to return to work on Lost.|$|E

He explained, [...] "I would hate to think our imagination is so slender that there aren't other possibilities to think about." [...] The first casting call was sent out on December 10, 1986. While some characters such as Geordi La Forge and Beverly Crusher remain recognizable from their descriptions in the initial casting call, others have clear differences; [...] "Julien Picard" [...] would lapse into a French accent when he became emotional, and Data was non-Caucasian. Macha Hernandez was a Latino security chief based on Jenette Goldstein's role in Aliens, while Deanna Troi was to appear [...] "foreign" [...] or more specifically of an Icelandic or Scandinavian nature. Leslie Crusher was listed as a fifteen-year-old girl with a photographic memory, although was quickly changed to a male teenager called Wesley. Justman argued for a female teenager but Roddenberry thought {{that there would be}} a greater number of storylines available if the character was male.|$|E

2500|$|This {{created a}} serious problem for Scott. He was troubled by the sweep of guilty verdicts. He {{did not want to}} {{alienate}} the Mexican public, who by now had made the deserters national heroes. Nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> to encourage insurgency among the Mexican people that would weaken his pacification program in progress. He also knew that the deserters were Irish-born Catholics, who had deserted Taylor's army because they allegedly felt mistreated and had witnessed atrocities [...] "sufficient to make Heaven weep" [...] against fellow Catholics, the Mexicans. In response to these, in 1847, Scott ordered that Protestants respect Catholic ceremonies.|$|E

2500|$|Gibson did {{not want}} to expose his quarterback to further risk of injury, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> to risk his players being fined for violating the league's rules against fighting. Most importantly, the last thing he wanted was for his team to get a penalty, which could stop the clock and require getting another first down to secure the win. [...] He also {{personally}} despised the kneeling play, considering it unsporting and somewhat dishonorable (a view popular among a lot of coaches of the period). Also given that the play clock at the time was only 30 seconds (as it would remain through the 1987 season), a play had to be run. So on second down he called [...] "65 Power-Up", a standard play which called for Csonka to take a handoff and run up the middle. Csonka took the ball and ran for 11 yards. For the third play in the Giants' series, the same play was called again.|$|E
