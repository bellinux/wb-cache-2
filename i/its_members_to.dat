5|$|As his sixtieth {{birthday}} {{approached in}} 1939, Beecham was advised by his doctors {{to take a}} year's break from conducting, and he planned to go abroad to rest in a warm climate, leaving the orchestra in other hands.

Many metal and construction workers, who had a localist tradition, left {{as a result of}} the syndicalist and anarchist tendencies in the FVdG. Miners, who worked mostly in the Ruhr area, did not have this tradition but developed a certain skepticism of bureaucratic structures. About 450 of them joined the FVdG before World War I, a sign of what was to come after the war.|$|E

The FVdG remained affiliated with the SPD, which in turn tolerated it because the SPD was afraid a split would lead to a large loss of members. The FVdG stated it would rejoin the centralized trade unions like the SPD leadership desired only if the centralized unions accepted the FVdG's organizational principles.|$|E
