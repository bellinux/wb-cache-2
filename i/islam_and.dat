Budi Utomo, Sarekat <b>Islam</b> <b>and</b> others pursued strategies of co-operation by joining the Dutch initiated Volksraad ("People's Council") in the hope that Indonesia would be granted self-rule. Others chose a non-cooperative strategy demanding the freedom of self-government from the Dutch East Indies colony. The most notable of these leaders were Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta, two students and nationalist leaders who had benefited from the educational reforms of the Dutch Ethical Policy.|$|E

40|$|<b>Islam</b> in Indonesian <b>and</b> Malay {{world is}} very much heterogenuous. Taking Islam Liberal, <b>Islam</b> Hadhari, <b>and</b> <b>Islam</b> Progresif as the subject of analysis, this article deals with the {{concepts}} Islam Liberal, <b>Islam</b> Hadhari, <b>and</b> <b>Islam</b> Progresif as products of the trends in Islamic thinking, {{the impact of these}} three interpretations of <b>Islam</b> in Malaysia <b>and</b> Indonesia, the similarities and dissimilarities between the three, and their future prospects in the region. It argues that the prominence of the debates surrounding the three currents of Islamic thought is the result of struggles for power and authority in Islamic discourse in the region.

Islam Progresif is more of an umbrella term referring to various strands of thought developed by Muslims opposed to the status quo. Although Islam Hadhari is a newly-coined term, it contains many elements in common with other schools of Islamic thought including <b>Islam</b> Liberal <b>and</b> neo-modernist <b>Islam.</b> </p...|$|R
