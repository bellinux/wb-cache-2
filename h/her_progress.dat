5|$|The four {{difficulty}} {{levels for}} each song afford the player a learning curve {{in order to}} help him or <b>her</b> <b>progress</b> in skill. The first difficulty level, Easy, only focuses on the first three fret buttons while displaying a significantly reduced amount of notes for the player to play. Medium introduces a fourth fret button while adding more notes, and Hard includes the final fret button while adding additional notes. Expert does not introduce any other frets to learn, but adds more notes in a manner designed to challenge the player.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the series, Lara has a stamina meter which depletes while she is performing bouts of climbing: if the bar empties before reaching her destination, she falls. The {{rate at which the}} meter decrease slows if the player performs special actions that increase Lara's strength. These actions are also necessary to progress in many of the levels. The game incorporates elements similar to a role-playing game, whereby Lara can talk with various NPCs found throughout the environments and choose what kinds of answers to give: early in the game, these answers will directly affect <b>her</b> <b>progress</b> through the story. The game also features a second playable character, Kurtis Trent. Initially appearing to be an antagonist, he becomes controllable by the player late in the game. He features mainly identical moves to Lara, and his sections of the game are more based around combat.|$|E

5|$|Shion is {{aboard the}} Woglinde running tests on KOS-MOS when the crew {{pick up a}} Zohar Emulator, one of {{thirteen}} replicas of the Zohar. Cherenkov monitors <b>her</b> <b>progress,</b> {{but at the same}} time is a U-TIC spy furthering their goal of finding the original Zohar. Following the Zohar Emulator's retrieval, the Woglinde is attacked by Gnosis. KOS-MOS self-activates and protects Shion's team, in the process killing Federation officer Luis Virgil with friendly fire to save Shion and her assistant Allen. KOS-MOS brings them along with Cherenkov on board the Elsa, which is heading to their destination of Second Miltia. When a Gnosis attacks, chaos' ability to dispel them saves Cherenkov's life. The attack begins mutating Cherenkov, tormenting him with visions of his past as a soldier who failed to adjust to civilian life and killed many people including his wife. During these periods, Shion becomes concerned that KOS-MOS is displaying aberrant behavior, and Allen worries about Shion's emotional state. Alongside these events, the cyborg Ziggy is dispatched to rescue the Realian MOMO from U-TIC, as data stored inside her could open the way to the original planet Miltia, lost in a disaster for which her creator Joachim Mizrahi is blamed. Ziggy rescues MOMO and narrowly escapes, fending off attacks by Margulis. Albedo, who is working with U-TIC for his own goals, sets out in pursuit of MOMO.|$|E

Frustrated with <b>her</b> <b>progress,</b> she started playing a common computer version of the card game solitaire. After a time she started using the computer more for playing the card game than actual work. From her previous experience, she recognized that she was demonstrating addictive behaviors. Orzack listed several symptoms of computer addiction, including using the computer for pleasure and relief from stress, feeling out of control and depressed when not using it, neglecting real life responsibilities and failure in attempts to cut down usage.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, Welden was {{a sophomore}} at Bennington College in North Bennington, Vermont.

She was an art major but, dissatisfied with the faculty and <b>her</b> <b>progress,</b> was contemplating changing her major; she had discovered a newfound love of botany. Welden, a typical student, was sorting out her own interests from those of her parents and was trying to expand her circle of friends.

25|$|<b>Her</b> <b>progress</b> stagnated in 2007 as {{she failed}} to clear higher than 4.50m. Still, she took third place at the USA Outdoors and competed at the 2007 World Championships, where she {{achieved}} her season's best of 4.50m in qualifying. She started 2008 with a big personal best indoors in Jonesboro, improving 12cm with a clearance of 4.72m. She was again the runner-up at the USA Indoors, this time behind Jennifer Stuczynski. At the 2008 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Valencia, Spain, she was eliminated once again at the qualifying stage. She set her sights on making the team for the 2008 Beijing Olympics and had podium finishes at the Reebok Grand Prix and the Adidas Track Classic. However, she came fourth at the 2008 United States Olympic Trials, being beaten by the less-established April Steiner Bennett and Erica Bartolina.|$|E
25|$|On 21 October 1960, Francisco Morazan began {{what was}} to be her last voyage from Miami, Florida. She sailed to Montreal and Toronto, where she {{unloaded}} a cargo of phosphates. Francisco Morazan then sailed to Chicago, arriving there in mid-November. At Chicago, 1,118 tons, 10 cwt of mixed cargo was loaded, destined for Rotterdam, Netherlands and Hamburg, Germany. The cargo included aluminium, baled hair, bottle caps, canned chicken, castings, chemicals, Gilsonite, hides, lard, machinery, phosphate, scrap metal, solder dross, tinplate, and toys. Francisco Morazan departed Chicago on 28 November. Fog on Lake Michigan slowed <b>her</b> <b>progress</b> and a problem with the feed pump for the boiler required the ship to be stopped while the pump was repaired. This meant Francisco Morazan was now in a race to leave the Great Lakes before the system closed to navigation on 3 December.|$|E
25|$|When Genie {{left the}} Riglers' house in mid-1975, {{at the age}} of 18, she had {{acquired}} a degree of vocabulary and grammar far greater than that observed in non-human subjects. In June of that year, David Rigler wrote that she continued to make significant strides in every field which the scientists were testing. Despite the marked improvement in Genie's language, it was still clearly abnormal. The words she learned continued to remain far ahead of the grammar she possessed and still showed an unusual focus on objective properties, and the gap between her receptive and expressive vocabulary had grown. While her use and comprehension of grammar had clearly improved, and papers from the time indicated she was continuing to acquire it, they were still highly deficient and <b>her</b> <b>progress</b> remained far slower than linguists had anticipated. And how much of what she did use was attributable to acquisition versus rote memory was not readily obvious.|$|E

25|$|When Sedgwick {{was seven}} or eight, {{she passed the}} summer {{under the care of}} her cousin Sabrina Parsons, in Bennington, Vermont, at the house of the Rev. Mr. Swift, the husband of Sedgwick's aunt. At home, she {{attended}} the district schools, but no one dictated her studies or overlooked <b>her</b> <b>progress.</b> Reading, spelling, and Dwight's Geography were the only subjects taught, in addition to the first four rules of arithmetic, the names of the several parts of speech. During her first winter in New York, when she was 11 years old, she studied dance under M. Lalliet, and had a French master who came three times a week. About two years later, she attended Mrs. Bell's boarding school in Albany, New York, as a day-scholar. At the age of 15, she was sent to Mr. Payne's boarding school in Boston to complete her education, and was there for six months. One of her schoolmates, Susan Anne Ridley Sedgwick (1788–1867), would become her sister-in-law and a published author.|$|E
25|$|By April and May 1971, Genie's {{scores on}} the Leiter International Performance Scale tests had {{dramatically}} increased, with her overall mental age {{at the level of}} a typical 4-year-9-month-old, but on individual components she still showed a very high level of scatter. <b>Her</b> <b>progress</b> with language accelerated, and doctors noticed that the words she used indicated a fairly advanced mental categorization of objects and situations and focused on objective properties to a degree not normally found in children. Around that time, when a minor earthquake struck Los Angeles, she ran frightened into the kitchen and rapidly verbalized to some of the hospital cooks she had befriended, marking the first time she sought out comfort from another person and the first time she was so readily verbal. However, she still had a hard time being with large crowds of people; at her birthday party, she became so anxious at all the guests present that she had to go outside with Rigler to calm down.|$|E
25|$|Some of Genie's {{pronunciation}} {{rules and}} limitations were characteristic of typical General American English speakers, and <b>her</b> <b>progress</b> with learning to pronounce individual phonemes followed relatively normal patterns for a first-language learner, {{but many others}} were highly atypical. Her speech typically contained unusually extensive deletions and substitutions, including vowel reduction, neutralization, and consonant modifications, and she typically spoke in an extremely high-pitched and monotonic voice. Curtiss determined that, despite the unpredictability with which Genie applied many of her pronunciation rules, there were several clearly defined patterns in her speech. Some of Genie's pronunciation rules and phonological limitations were normal for General American English speakers, and she clearly limited the variability of her substitutions. Similar to young children, Genie's enunciation remained far better in imitation than in her own utterances. The scientists {{worked very hard to}} strengthen Genie's voice and improve her articulation, but in her dissertation Curtiss wrote that Genie's speech was still extremely difficult to represent using standard IPA.|$|E
