5|$|Postan {{argued that}} {{demography}} {{was the principal}} driving force in the medieval English economy. In a distinctly Malthusian fashion, Postan proposed that the English agrarian economy saw little technical development during the period and by the early 14th century was unable to support the growing population, leading to inevitable famines and economic depression as the population came back into balance with land resources. Postan began the trend towards stressing continuities between the pre- and post-invasion economies, aided by <b>fresh</b> <b>evidence</b> emerging {{from the use of}} archaeological techniques to understand the medieval economy from the 1950s onwards.|$|E
5|$|Bamber's {{case was}} {{passed to the}} Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) when it was {{established}} in 1997 to review alleged miscarriages of justice. The CCRC referred {{the case to the}} Court of Appeal in March 2001 on the grounds that new DNA testing on the silencer constituted <b>fresh</b> <b>evidence.</b> The appeal was heard from 17 October to 1 November 2002 at the Royal Courts of Justice by Lord Justice Kay, Mr Justice Wright and Mr Justice Henriques, who published their decision on 12 December 2002. The prosecution was represented by Victor Temple QC and Bamber by Michael Turner QC. In a 522-point judgment, the judges said that there was no conduct on the part of investigators that threatened the integrity of the trial, and that the more they examined the case, the more they thought the jury had been right.|$|E

25|$|The double {{jeopardy}} rule {{means that a}} person cannot be tried more than once for the same offence. It is an important safeguard to acquitted defendants, {{but there is an}} important general public interest in ensuring that those who have committed serious crimes are convicted of them. The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report recognised that the rule is capable of causing grave injustice to victims and the community in certain cases where compelling <b>fresh</b> <b>evidence</b> has come to light after an acquittal. It called for a change in the law to be considered, and we have accepted that such a change is appropriate. The European Convention on Human Rights (Article 4(2) of Protocol 7) explicitly recognises the importance of being able to re-open cases where new evidence comes to light.|$|E

500|$|Following a {{television}} news report on 4 January 2011 that criticised {{the handling of}} the investigation, ITN reporters were banned by the Avon and Somerset Constabulary from attending a press conference convened to give updates on the murder case. The item, presented by journalist Geraint Vincent, claimed police had made little progress with their investigation, and questioned whether they were following correct procedural methods. A former murder squad detective told the report that [...] "certain routine inquiries" [...] such as looking for <b>fresh</b> <b>evidence</b> at the crime scene were not being carried out. ITN accused the police of attempting [...] "to censor what information we can broadcast" [...] while the constabulary {{filed a complaint with the}} Office of Communications, calling the broadcast [...] "unfair, naïve and irresponsible reporting". The police subsequently lifted the sanctions against ITN, but said that they would [...] "not hesitate to adopt similar tactics in the future." [...] Legal action was also considered over a tweet revealing that Tabak had viewed internet pornography showing erotic asphyxiation and bondage. The contempt of court charges were dropped after the tweet was removed.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, {{the police}} {{launched}} Operation Maida, and again searched the moor {{for the body}} of Keith Bennett. They read statements from Brady and Hindley, and also studied photographs taken by the pair. Their search was aided {{by the use of}} sophisticated modern equipment, including a US satellite used to look for evidence of soil movement. The BBC reported on 1 July 2009 that Greater Manchester Police had officially given up the search for Keith Bennett, saying that [...] "only a major scientific breakthrough or <b>fresh</b> <b>evidence</b> would see the hunt for his body restart". Detectives were also reported as saying that they would never again give Brady the attention or the thrill of leading another fruitless search on the moor where they believe Keith Bennett's remains are buried. Donations from members of the public funded a search of the moor for Bennett's body by volunteers from a Welsh search and rescue team that began in March 2010. In August 2012, it was claimed that Brady may have given details of the location of Keith Bennett's body to one of his visitors. A woman was subsequently arrested on suspicion of preventing the burial of a body without lawful excuse, but a few months later the Crown Prosecution Service announced that there was insufficient evidence to press charges. Keith Bennett's body remains undiscovered as of , although his family continues to search the moor.|$|E

The official letter to the family falsely claimed she had died 16 June 1941, but recent research by Lisa Quernes, a student at the Landesmusikgymnasium in Montabaur, has determined that she was gassed along with 89 other people at the Hadamar Euthanasia Centre in Hesse-Nassau on 27 May 1941 [...] Stockhausen dramatized his mother's death in hospital by lethal injection, in Act 1 scene 2 ("") of the opera Donnerstag aus Licht [...] In the autumn of 1944, he was conscripted to serve as a stretcher bearer in Bedburg [...] In February 1945, he met his father for the last time in Altenberg.

2500|$|In Cinpres Gas Injection Ltd v Melea Ltd, an {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt was made}} to resurrect the supplemental bill of review. [...] Jacob LJ, giving the judgement of the Court of Appeal, held that an attempt to invoke the old bill of review could not succeed because, for generations, applications for rehearing on the basis of <b>fresh</b> <b>evidence</b> had been made to the Court of Appeal and, if the bill of review procedure had survived the Judicature Acts, it had long since lapsed.
