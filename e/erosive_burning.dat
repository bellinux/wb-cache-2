40|$|Four <b>erosive</b> <b>burning</b> models, {{equations}} (11) to (14). {{are developed}} {{in this work}} by using a power law relationship to correlate (1) the <b>erosive</b> <b>burning</b> ratio and the local velocity gradient at propellant surfaces; (2) the <b>erosive</b> <b>burning</b> ratio and the velocity gradient divided by centerline velocity; (3) the <b>erosive</b> <b>burning</b> difference and the local velocity gradient at propellant surfaces; and (4) the <b>erosive</b> <b>burning</b> difference and the velocity gradient divided by centerline velocity. These models depend on the local velocity gradient at the propellant surface (or the velocity gradient divided by centerline velocity) only and, unlike other empirical models, are independent of the motor size. It was argued that, since the <b>erosive</b> <b>burning</b> is a local phenomenon occurring near {{the surface of the}} solid propellant, the <b>erosive</b> <b>burning</b> ratio should be independent of the bore diameter if it is correlated with some local flow parameters such as the velocity gradient at the propellant surface.

The combustion in turbulent flow is considered by developing a model of interaction between turbulent and chemical reaction of combustion. Transport equation for turbulence heat flux defined in the Reynolds time-averaged form is taken into account including a source term describing the influence of chemical reaction. another mechanism of combustion reaction effect on turbulent heat transfer is analyzed by introducing a new characteristic period for the turbulent fluctuations, i. e. only fluctuations having a characteristic period that is smaller than corresponding characteristic period of reaction can affect the heat transfer in the flame zone. The local-isotropic assumption is carried out to reduce full transport equation for turbulent fluctuations of temperature to simple foraulae. Hence,a new correlation for effective coefficient of turbulent heat transfer affected by chemical reaction is formulated. The effect of <b>erosive</b> burning(increase of <b>burning</b> rate of solid fuel under blowing of burning surface) is studied numerically by boundary layer approach.

The integrated internal ballistics code (Rocballist) is used to investigate the role of these two burning rate augmenting mechanisms in solid rocket motor performance. Two tactical motors are used as test cases. Results indicate that dynamic burning can be the dominant factor in producing a short-duration ignition pressure spike in low-L???? motors, particularly if the L=D ratio is not too large and the port cross section is nonrestrictive (e. g., center perforated grain). However, when L=D is large and the port cross section is noncircular in the aft section (aft fins/slots), <b>erosive</b> <b>burning</b> can take over in dominating the burning rate {{to the extent that}} an otherwise progressive pressure-time trace becomes regressive/neutral.

A brief introduction describes the motor design problems caused by this phenomenon, particularly for low port/throat area ratio motors and nozzleless motors. Various experimental techniques for measuring crossflow sensitivity of solid propellant burning rates are described, with the conclusion that accurate simulation of the flow, including upstream flow development, in actual motors is important since the degree of <b>erosive</b> <b>burning</b> depends not only on local mean crossflow velocity and propellant nature, but also upon this upstream development. In the modeling area, a brief review of simplified models and correlating equations is presented, followed by a description of more complex numerical analysis models.

The characterization of these propellants indicates a remarkably similar <b>erosive</b> <b>burning</b> response to the induced flow environment. Propellant burnrates for each type had a conventional response with respect to pressure up to a bulk flow velocity threshold.

In particular, the attention is focused on the effects on the SRM behavior of the <b>erosive</b> <b>burning,</b> total pressure drops and the possible nature of the pressure overpeak, occurring during {{the last part of the}} ignition transient for both the SRMs. The final objective is, to develop an analysis/simulation capability of SRM internal ballistic for the entire combustion time, with simplified physical models, in order to reduce the computational cost required, but ensuring, in the meanwhile, an accuracy of the simulation greater than the one usually given by 0 D models. The results of the simulations performed for the two NAWC tactical motors indicates a good agreement with the experimental data, as no attempt of sub-models calibration has been made, enforcing the ability of the proposed approach to predict the internal ballistics of SRMs. The numerical simulations shows that whereas the NAWC n. 6 overall internal ballistics is completely led by the <b>erosive</b> <b>burning,</b> which dominates the burning rate, causing the pressure peak occurring immediately after SRM start-up, the NAWC n. 13 instead is not driven by the <b>erosive</b> <b>burning,</b> which however is not completely negligible...|$|E

Suffice {{it to say that}} the search for a way to predict <b>erosive</b> <b>burning</b> in any size motor with formulas cleanly applicable to a typical 1 D ballistics analysis has been long thwarted. Some models were based on testing that failed to adequately simulate the solid rocket motor environment. In most cases, no realtime burn rate measurement was available. Two popular models, even when calibrated to recent motorlike realtime burn rate data obtained by Furfaro, were shown by McMillin to be inadequate at modeling <b>erosive</b> <b>burning</b> in the Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM), the Space Launch Systems' FiveSegment RSRM (RSRMV), and the fivesegment Engineering Test Motor (ETM) 3. Subsequently to the data cited from Strand and Furfaro, additional motors of the same kind as Furfaro's were tested with RSRMV propellant, utilizing 7 segments per motor and 3 throat sizes. By measuring propellant web thickness with ultrasonic gages, the burn rate was determined at crossflow Mach numbers up to Mach 0. 8. Furthermore, because of the different throat sizes in otherwise identical motors, this provides a unique look at the effect of pressure and base burn rate on the erosive response. Figure 1 shows example of the data pertaining to the high Mach motor, where the port area is initially less than the throat area. The burn rate data was processed using a smoothing method developed to reduce the noise without too severely introducing end effects that limit the range of useful data. Then, an empirical ballistics scheme was used to estimate the flow condition based on the burn rate measurements and pressure measured between each segment...|$|E

To achieve these higher thrust levels and improve motor reliability, advanced motor design concepts were employed. In the head end of the motor, for instance, the propellent cast has been changed from the conventional annular configuration to a 'multi-slot' configuration in order to increase the burn surface area and guarantee rapid motor ignition. In addition, the igniter itself has been redesigned and currently features 12 exhaust ports in order to channel hot igniter combustion gases into the circumferential propellent slots.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{developing}} an <b>erosive</b> <b>burning</b> model {{for use in}} solid propellant design-and-analysis interior ballistics codes is described and evaluated. Using Direct Numerical Simulation, the primary mechanisms controlling <b>erosive</b> <b>burning</b> (turbulent heat transfer, and finite rate reactions) have been studied independently {{through the development of}} models using finite rate chemistry, and infinite rate chemistry. Both approaches are calibrated to strand burn rate data by modeling the propellant burning in an environment with no cross-flow, and adjusting thermophysical properties until the predicted regression rate matches test data. Subsequent runs are conducted where the cross-flow is increased from M= 0. 0 up to M= 0. 8. The resulting relationship of burn rate increase versus Mach Number is used in an interior ballistics analysis to compute the chamber pressure of an existing solid rocket motor. The resulting predictions are compared to static test data. 	Both the infinite rate model and the finite rate model show good agreement when compared to test data. The propellant considered is an AP/HTPB with an average AP particle size of 37 microns. The finite rate model shows that as the cross-flow increases, near wall vorticity increases due to the lifting of the boundary caused by the side injection of gases from the burning propellant surface. The point of maximum vorticity corresponds to {{the outer edge of the}} APd-binder flame. As the cross-flow increases, the APd-binder flame thickness becomes thinner; however, the point of highest reaction rate moves only slightly closer to the propellant surface. As such, the net increase of heat transfer to the propellant surface due to finite rate chemistry affects is small. This leads to the conclusion that augmentation of thermal transport properties and the resulting heat transfer increase due to turbulence dominates over combustion chemistry in the <b>erosive</b> <b>burning</b> problem. This conclusion is advantageous in the development of future models that can be calibrated to heat transfer conditions without the necessity for finite rate chemistry. These results are considered applicable for propellants with small, evenly distributed AP particles where the assumption of premixed APd-binder gases is reasonable. Ph. D.
