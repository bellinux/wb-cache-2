5|$|Affairs quieted {{after the}} initial persecution. Diocletian {{remained}} in Antioch for the following three years. He visited Egypt once, over the winter of 301302, where he began the grain dole in Alexandria. In Egypt, some Manicheans, followers of the prophet Mani, were denounced {{in the presence of}} the proconsul of Africa. On March 31, 302, in a rescript from Alexandria, Diocletian, after consultation with the proconsul for Egypt, ordered that the leading Manicheans be burnt alive along with their scriptures. This was the first time an Imperial persecution <b>ever</b> <b>called</b> for the destruction of sacred literature. Low-status Manicheans were to be executed; high-status Manicheans were to be sent to work in the quarries of Proconnesus (Marmara Island) or the mines of Phaeno. All Manichean property was to be seized and deposited in the imperial treasury.|$|E
5|$|Mountains {{continued}} to rise in the Sevier orogenic belt to the west during the Cretaceous while the roughly north-south trending Western Interior Basin expanded. Rifting in the Gulf of Mexico helped {{the southern end of}} the basin to subside, which allowed marine water to advance northward. At the same time, the shoreline advanced inland from the Arctic region. The seas advanced and retreated many times during the Cretaceous until one of the most extensive interior seaways <b>ever,</b> <b>called</b> the Western Interior Seaway, drowned much of western North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. The western shoreline of the seaway was in the vicinity of Cedar City, Utah while the eastern margin was part of the low-lying, stable platform ramp in Nebraska and Kansas.|$|E
5|$|Robert Silverberg connects {{this account}} with {{historical}} events of 1141, when the Kara-Khitan Khanate under Yelü Dashi defeated the Seljuk Turks near Samarkand. The Seljuks ruled over Persia {{at the time}} and were the most powerful force in the Muslim world, and the defeat at Samarkand weakened them substantially. While the Kara-Khitan at the time were Buddhists and not Christian, {{and there is no reason}} to suppose Yelü Dashi was <b>ever</b> <b>called</b> Prester John. However, several vassals of the Kara-Khitan practiced Nestorian Christianity, which may have contributed to the legend, as well as the possibility that the Europeans, who were unfamiliar with Buddhism, assumed that if the leader was not Muslim, he must be Christian. The defeat encouraged the Crusaders and inspired a notion of deliverance from the East, and it is possible Otto recorded Hugh's confused report to prevent complacency in the Crusade's European backers; according to his account, no help could be expected from a powerful Eastern king.|$|E

5|$|The first {{televised}} prime ministerial {{debate was}} organised by the state-owned broadcaster Finnish Broadcasting Company on 31 March in Tampere and included the chairpersons {{of the four}} parties leading in the opinion polls. The European sovereign debt crisis featured prominently in the debate; {{the leaders of the}} governing coalition, Katainen and Kiviniemi, defended Finland's participation in guaranteeing the loans to crisis-ridden EU countries claiming that Finland would otherwise risk plunging into a new recession as the country is dependent on exports to other European countries. As the chairpersons of the leading opposition parties, Soini and Urpilainen denied this claim and insisted that the debt-ridden countries should rather be allowed to go into their own debt restructuring. Urpilainen was not entirely against emergency measures aimed at saving these countries, but insisted that the major European banks ought to play a larger role in the guarantees. Soini continued his criticism of the euro, reiterating that no referendum was <b>ever</b> <b>called</b> on the currency union — he remained steadfast on his party's opposition to Finland guaranteeing the loans and presented the upcoming election as a referendum on the issue. On other economic issues, Kiviniemi continued to insist that spending cuts are not necessary in the following years — a claim repudiated by the other party leaders. Urpilainen and, initially, also Katainen were willing to make cuts on military spending; Soini, however, contested the cut but was instead ready to cut development aid and immigration-related expenses.|$|E

25|$|Some doubts {{were raised}} about the {{legality}} of Clarke's bowling action {{while he was at}} Surrey. Several opposition sides made official complaints about Clarke's faster ball and umpire Dickie Bird closely studied tapes of Clarke's action for any irregularities but found none, nor was Clarke <b>ever</b> <b>called</b> for throwing. It is commonly accepted that rather than chucking, it was Clarke's sheer strength and unusually open-chested action, combined with his speed, that left opposition batsmen fearing for their safety when facing him.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} {{televised}} in the United States by Fox, with play-by-play announcer Joe Buck and color commentators Cris Collinsworth and Troy Aikman.

This {{marked the first}} time since Super Bowl I that none of the network commentators had <b>ever</b> <b>called</b> a Super Bowl game before (although Collinsworth had worked three prior Super Bowl telecasts as a pregame analyst). This was the last game that Cris Collinsworth broadcast {{as a member of the}} Fox NFL team, as he chose to sign with NBC in the following off-season.|$|E

500|$|Since 1862, Bizet {{had been}} working {{intermittently}} on Ivan IV, an opera based {{on the life of}} Ivan the Terrible. Carvalho failed to deliver on his promise to produce it, so in December 1865, Bizet offered it to the Opéra, which rejected it; the work remained unperformed until 1946. In July 1866, Bizet signed another contract with Carvalho, for La jolie fille de Perth, the libretto for which, by J.H. Vernoy de Saint-Georges after Sir Walter Scott, is described by Bizet's biographer Winton Dean as [...] "the worst Bizet was <b>ever</b> <b>called</b> upon to set". Problems over the casting and other issues delayed its premiere for a year before it was finally performed by the Théâtre Lyrique on 26 December 1867. Its press reception was more favourable than that for any of Bizet's other operas; Le Ménestral's critic hailed the second act as [...] "a masterpiece from beginning to end". Despite the opera's success, Carvalho's financial difficulties meant a run of only 18 performances.|$|E

500|$|In {{literature}} Tunis' contributions {{have sometimes}} been direct. His baseball books, especially The Kid from Tomkinsville, {{have been cited}} as one source of inspiration for Bernard Malamud's book The Natural, about baseball star Roy Hobbs. Among other similarities, both Hobbs and Tucker started as pitchers but, thanks to accidents, ended up as outfielders and power-hitters. It has been suggested by Michele Schiavone in her study of Tunis' influence on Malamud and Roth that, as an early fan of the Dodgers, Malamud was familiar with Tunis' books and borrowed from them, [...] "consciously or not". Bruce Brooks' introduction to the 1987 edition of The Kid from Tomkinsville [...] says that Tunis [...] "obviously" [...] inspired Mark Harris, author of Bang the Drum Slowly. And in what D. G. Myers in Best Baseball Books <b>Ever</b> <b>called</b> [...] "one of the best pieces of (literary) criticism ever written", The Kid from Tomkinsville is referenced by Nathan Zuckerman, the main character in Philip Roth's novel American Pastoral. For Zuckerman, Tunis' book and pitcher Roy Tucker become what Schiavone called [...] "a template for Zuckerman's view of the Swede", and his realization of the [...] "tragic underside to the American Dream".|$|E
500|$|On 12September 1916, the British {{began to}} refer to No.1 Squadron as No.67 (Australian) Squadron RFC. This {{practice}} continued until January 1918, when the unit officially became known as No.1 Squadron AFC. The relationship between airmen and ground crew was less formal than in British units; squadron members recalled that [...] "The CO {{is the only one}} who is <b>ever</b> <b>called</b> 'sir and that officers did not demand [...] "saluting and standing to attention and all that rot". The unit received the first of several Martinsyde G.100 single-seat fighters to augment the B.E.2s on 16October; although considered obsolete, the [...] "Tinsyde" [...] was substantially faster than the B.E.2, and armed with forward-firing machine guns. Shortly before the squadron took part in a bombing raid against Beersheba on 11November, Lieutenant Lawrence Wackett managed to fix a machine gun to the top plane of one of the B.E.2s, using a mount he designed himself. Each flight was also assigned a Bristol Scout beginning in December, but it too was obsolete and under-powered, and the squadron ceased operating the type within three months. [...] Other older models issued to the unit included the Airco DH.6, Martinsyde G.102 and Nieuport17. On 17December, the squadron's flights were finally brought together at one base, Mustabig.|$|E
500|$|Sestak and Specter {{held their}} {{first and only}} {{televised}} debate on May 1 at Philadelphia's Fox affiliate, during which the two candidates bitterly attacked each other's character and honesty. The two began arguing even before the hour-long debate formally began, when Sestak objected to Specter's use of notes {{and said that the}} rules did not allow them. The debate organizer ruled the notes were allowed. Specter criticized Sestak for campaign advertisements that accused the Senator of lying about Sestak's record. Specter said, [...] "Nobody has <b>ever</b> <b>called</b> me a liar," [...] and demanded an apology, to which Sestak did not respond. Specter also repeatedly asked Sestak to publicly release his military records, to which Sestak again refused to respond. Sestak accused Specter of using Republican-style tactics in the vein of Karl Rove, former adviser to George W. Bush, and said Specter's attacks were meant to mask his record of supporting Bush's failed economic policies. Specter insisted the questions raised about Sestak's naval record were legitimate because much of Sestak's campaign was based on his military background, adding, [...] "It goes to his ability to get things done, to get along with people. He's all peaches and cream on television." [...] Specter criticized Sestak for supporting the troop build-up in Afghanistan, while Sestak noted that Specter voted against a ban on assault weapons in the 1990s. The Philadelphia Inquirer noted the debate was [...] "every bit as contentious as their Democratic Senate primary struggle has become in its closing days".|$|E

500|$|Differences between Hogan and the McDonald brothers, however, {{had already}} {{surfaced}} {{in the autumn of}} 1906. [...] Although a sports writer for The Youngstown Daily Vindicator predicted in October 1906 that the [...] "popular" [...] Hogan would serve a fourth season as manager of the club, the Ohio Works manager appeared unwilling to negotiate the terms of a new contract without leverage. [...] According to the Vindicator, Hogan publicly mulled an offer presented by a team in Nashville, whose representatives followed him to the train station. [...] The same newspaper article indicated that Hogan later reached a verbal agreement with Ohio Works co-owners Joseph and Thomas McDonald, announcing soon afterwards that he would remain with the local ball club. [...] Yet, by January 1907, the Newark Advocate reported that Hogan wanted to sell the Youngstown franchise. [...] The paper observed that [...] "a move in offering the Youngstown franchise for sale had created a furor in the league". [...] On January 8, 1907, Hogan and Joseph McDonald attended {{the annual meeting of the}} National Association of Professional Baseball Clubs in New York City, while the fate of the club remained uncertain. [...] Then, on January 13, The New York Times reported that the Youngstown team would participate in an eight-team [...] "outlaw league" [...] comprising clubs from Elmira, New York; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh, Reading, Pennsylvania; Scranton, Pennsylvania; Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania; and Williamsport, Ohio. [...] The Times described the envisioned league as [...] "the most powerful 'outlaw' league the National Association of Professional Baseball Clubs was <b>ever</b> <b>called</b> upon to oppose", and stated that Hogan would [...] "be at the head of" [...] the Youngstown team. [...] These rather confusing reports were followed by the abrupt sale and relocation of the Ohio Works team in February 1907.|$|E
