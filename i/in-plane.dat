5|$|A test {{series was}} planned to {{determine}} RS-25 engine performance with: the new engine controller unit; lower liquid oxygen temperatures; greater inlet pressure {{due to the}} taller SLS core stage liquid oxygen tank and higher vehicle acceleration; and, more nozzle heating due to the four-engine configuration and its position <b>in-plane</b> with the SLS booster exhaust nozzles. New ablative insulation and heaters were to be tested during the series.|$|E

25|$|Several {{spacecraft}} (Mariner 10, Pioneer 11, and Voyagers 1 and 2) {{had performed}} gravity assist manoeuvres in the 1970s. Those manoeuvres were to reach other planets also orbiting {{close to the}} ecliptic, so they were mostly <b>in-plane</b> changes. However, gravity assists {{are not limited to}} <b>in-plane</b> maneuvers; a suitable flyby of Jupiter could produce a significant plane change. An Out-Of-The-Ecliptic mission (OOE) was thereby proposed. See article Pioneer H.|$|E
25|$|Severely damaged {{building}} of Agriculture Development Bank of China after 2008 Sichuan earthquake: {{most of the}} beams and pier columns are sheared. Large diagonal cracks in masonry and veneer are due to <b>in-plane</b> loads while abrupt settlement of the right end of the building should {{be attributed to a}} landfill which may be hazardous even without any earthquake.|$|E
25|$|A {{crash in}} February 1926, caused by blade root failure, {{led to an}} {{improvement}} in rotor hub design. A drag hinge was added {{in conjunction with the}} flapping hinge to allow each blade to move fore and aft and relieve <b>in-plane</b> stresses, generated as a byproduct of the flapping motion. This development led to the Cierva C.8, which, on 18 September 1928, made the first rotorcraft crossing of the English Channel followed by a tour of Europe.|$|E
25|$|Real-time MRI {{refers to}} the {{continuous}} monitoring ("filming") of moving objects in real time. While many different strategies have been developed since the early 2000s, a recent development reported a real-time MRI technique based on radial FLASH and iterative reconstruction that yields a temporal resolution of 20 to 30 milliseconds for images with an <b>in-plane</b> resolution of 1.5 to 2.0mm. The new method promises to add important information about diseases of the joints and the heart. In many cases MRI examinations may become easier and more comfortable for patients.|$|E
25|$|Mobile phone use on {{aircraft}} {{is starting}} to be allowed with several airlines already offering {{the ability to use}} phones during flights. Mobile phone use during flights used to be prohibited and many airlines still claim in their <b>in-plane</b> announcements that this prohibition is due to possible interference with aircraft radio communications. Shut-off mobile phones do not interfere with aircraft avionics. The recommendation why phones should not be used during take-off and landing, even on planes that allow calls or messaging, is so that passengers pay attention to the crew for any possible accident situations, as most aircraft accidents happen on take-off and landing.|$|E
25|$|<b>In-plane</b> {{switching}} is an LCD {{technology that}} aligns the liquid crystals {{in a plane}} parallel to the glass substrates. In this method, the electrical field is applied through opposite electrodes on the same glass substrate, so that the liquid crystals can be reoriented (switched) essentially in the same plane, although fringe fields inhibit a homogeneous reorientation. This requires two transistors for each pixel instead of the single transistor needed for a standard thin-film transistor (TFT) display. Before LG Enhanced IPS was introduced in 2009, the additional transistors resulted in blocking more transmission area, thus requiring a brighter backlight and consuming more power, making this type of display less desirable for notebook computers. Currently Panasonic is using an enhanced version eIPS for their large size LCD-TV products as well as Hewlett-Packard in its WebOS based TouchPad tablet and their Chromebook 11.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} features of any VECSEL is the small thickness of the semiconductor gain region in the direction of propagation, less than 100nm. In contrast, a conventional <b>in-plane</b> semiconductor laser entails light propagation over distances of from 250Âµm upward to 2mm or longer. The significance of the short propagation distance is that it causes the effect of [...] "antiguiding" [...] nonlinearities in the diode laser gain region to be minimized. The result is a large-cross-section single-mode optical beam which is not attainable from <b>in-plane</b> ("edge-emitting") diode lasers.|$|E

2500|$|Arching or {{compressive}} membrane action (CMA) in {{reinforced concrete}} slabs occurs {{as a result}} of the great difference between the tensile and compressive strength of concrete. [...] Cracking of the concrete causes a migration of the neutral axis which is accompanied by <b>in-plane</b> expansion of the slab at its boundaries. [...] If this natural tendency to expand is restrained, the development of arching action enhances the strength of the slab.|$|E

2500|$|Two-dimensional {{elements}} that resist only <b>in-plane</b> forces by membrane action (plane stress, plane strain), and plates that resist transverse loads by transverse shear and [...] bending action (plates and shells). They {{may have a}} variety of shapes such as flat or curved triangles and quadrilaterals. Nodes are usually placed at the element corners, and if needed for higher accuracy, additional nodes can be placed along the element edges or even within the element. The elements are positioned at the mid-surface of the actual layer thickness.|$|E
2500|$|In {{fundamental}} fluid mechanics, displacement {{within a}} unit {{time in the}} X, Y and Z directions are commonly defined by the variables U, V and W. [...] As was previously described, basic PIV extracts the U and V displacements as functions of the <b>in-plane</b> X and Y directions. [...] This enables calculations of the , , [...] and [...] velocity gradients. [...] However, the other 5 terms of the velocity gradient tensor are unable to be found from this information. [...] The stereoscopic PIV analysis also grants the Z-axis displacement component, W, within that plane. [...] Not only does this grant the Z-axis velocity of the fluid at the plane of interest, but two more velocity gradient terms can be determined: [...] and [...] [...] The velocity gradient components , , and [...] can not be determined.|$|E

The nacelles were mostly wood, although, for strength, the engine mounts were all metal as were the undercarriage parts. Engine mounts of welded steel tube were added, along with simple landing gear oleos filled with rubber blocks. Wood was used to carry only <b>in-plane</b> loads, with metal fittings used for all triaxially loaded components such as landing gear, engine mounts, control surface mounting brackets, and the wing-to-fuselage junction. The outer leading wing edge had to be brought [...] further forward to accommodate this design. The main tail unit was all wood built.

5000|$|APG is an {{anisotropic}} material with extremely high <b>in-plane</b> thermal conductivity (1,700 W/m-K {{at room temperature}} [...] ) and low through-thickness conductivity. Its laminate structure remains stable across a wide temperature range allowing it {{to be used in}} a variety of heat transfer applications. APG's conductivity generally increases as the temperature decreases, peaking at 2,800 W/m-K at approximately 150 K. Unlike pyrolytic graphite, the x-y planar conductivity is consistent across each basal plane, thus the conductivity in the center planes is consistent with the outer planes. The <b>in-plane</b> covalently bonded carbon atoms in a hexagonal geometry account for APGâs high <b>in-plane</b> thermal conductivity and its high <b>in-plane</b> stiffness. Through its thickness, these hexagonal planes are weakly bonded (van der Waals bonds) resulting in a material with poor through-thickness thermal conductivity, stiffness, and strength.|$|E
