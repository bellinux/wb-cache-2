5|$|In an {{interview}} with The Jakarta Post, Aristo called Richard Curtis a large inspiration; he said that <b>he</b> <b>really</b> enjoyed Curtis' film The Girl in the Café (2005). He also cited Woody Allen, Richard Linklater and Robert Altman as further influences. His experience in journalism may have influenced his directing style.|$|E
5|$|Later, Detective Thomas tells Black that <b>he</b> <b>really</b> has {{no problem}} with Murphy—his true issue with the case is his own past. Having {{investigated}} sexual offences in the past, Thomas had found the cases affecting him personally, leaving him unable {{to have sex with}} his wife and leading to their divorce.|$|E

Well, I shall be quite happy in my opinion of him, from this time. You can't think how it elevates him in my opinion, to know for certain that <b>he's</b> <b>really</b> conscientious!' ...|$|R

5|$|Throughout {{his entire}} tenure in Congress, Paul has {{represented}} his district {{as a member}} of the Republican Party. However, he has frequently taken positions in direct opposition to the other members and the leadership of the party, and he has sometimes publicly questioned whether <b>he</b> <b>really</b> belonged in the party.|$|E
5|$|Tom Hollander as Lord Cutler Beckett: Sarcastic {{chairman}} of the East India Trading Company. He travels to Port Royal to capture and recruit Jack Sparrow as a privateer.

5|$|In {{the third}} series, Carlos put aside his roving ways {{and became the}} {{dominant}} male of the Starsky, with both Kinkajou and Mozart pregnant with his pups. Carlos was bitten in the face during a fight with Commandoes dominant male, Hannibal.

5|$|Metacritic later {{noted that}} Ebert tended {{to give more}} lenient ratings than most critics. His average film rating was 71% if {{translated}} into a percentage, compared to 59% for the site as a whole. 75% of his reviews were positive and 75% of his ratings were better than his colleagues. Although Ebert rarely wrote outright scathing reviews, he {{had a reputation for}} writing memorable ones for the films <b>he</b> <b>really</b> disliked, such as North.|$|E
5|$|Ste {{comes out}} to ex-girlfriend Amy first. During their {{conversation}} Ste reveales Amy was the only girl <b>he</b> <b>really</b> had feelings for and that his confusion over his sexuality was not the reason for him abusing her during their relation ship. Ste is very relieved by Amy's good reaction. Amy {{is the one who}} discovers that Brendan is hitting Ste and she tells Ste to break it off, reminding him of how it was when he was hitting her.|$|E
5|$|The Queen of Somnia {{tells the}} Hero to {{discover}} who <b>he</b> <b>really</b> is. The quest leads {{the party to}} Arkbolt, where a terrible monster is blocking a nearby cave.

500|$|In {{the final}} {{practice}} of rookie and selected veterans training camp on July 29, Kafka {{took all the}} snaps at quarterback after Kolb and Vick got practice off. After practice, offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg said Kafka was [...] "the best rookie that I've ever had in 15, 16, 17 years or something like that. So, <b>he's</b> <b>really</b> sharp. Now, <b>he's</b> sharp book-wise, but he's also very intelligent in a football sense. <b>He's</b> <b>really</b> picked [...] up very quickly." ...|$|R

5|$|Details of the {{assassination}} attempt were allegedly known by the principal Jesuit of England, Father Henry Garnet. Although {{he was convicted of}} treason and sentenced to death, doubt has been cast on how much <b>he</b> <b>really</b> knew of the plot. As its existence was revealed to him through confession, Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the absolute confidentiality of the confessional. Although anti-Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the plot's discovery, many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during King James I's reign. The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons and other public events such as the ringing of church bells, which have evolved into the Bonfire Night of today.|$|E
5|$|Flanagan {{observes that}} in Tenebrae, Argento offers two {{characters}} {{who suffer from}} impaired vision. Gianni (Christian Borromeo) is an eyewitness to an axe-murder, but the trauma of seeing the killing causes him to disregard a vital clue. Returning {{to the scene of}} the crime, he suddenly remembers everything, and is murdered before being able to tell anyone. Homicide detective Giermani reveals that he is a big fan of the novels of Agatha Christie, Mickey Spillane, Rex Stout, and Ed McBain, but admits that he has never been able to guess the identity of the killer in any of the books. He is similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at his feet – he cannot see Peter Neal for what <b>he</b> <b>really</b> is.|$|E
5|$|Ingels {{was born}} in Copenhagen in 1974 to an {{engineer}} father and a dentist mother. Hoping to become a cartoonist, he began to study architecture in 1993 at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts as {{he thought it would}} help him to improve his drawing skills. Only after he had been studying for a couple of years, did <b>he</b> <b>really</b> take an interest in architecture. He continued his studies at the Escola Tècnica Superior d'Arquitectura in Barcelona, and returned to Copenhagen to receive his diploma in 1999. As a third-year student in Barcelona, he set up his first practice and won his first competition.|$|E

She {{knows how}} much he fought for custody, for contact and how {{important}} it was for him to see his children. <b>He's</b> <b>really</b> angry about it and feels the world is against him. ... What <b>he's</b> <b>really</b> doing is self-harm which is a common response to anger. People do crazy, mad things like this when they're desperate. It's very ugly and disturbing. ... He's hit his kids and his mum, so yes, violence is something he's capable of." ...|$|R
5|$|Little of {{this was}} true, {{but at the time}} the British {{had no way of knowing}} this. The files of the Admiralstab in Berlin show that he was {{approached}} by N, rather than volunteering for intelligence service, entered their employment as early as May 1914 (rather than in August as he claimed), received regular pay rather than being unpaid, and intended to return to Berlin on completing his mission. It is unknown whether <b>he</b> <b>really</b> had any intention of going to the US, and there is no indication from the Admiralstab files that he had been asked to keep his controller's name a secret. After hearing Lody's evidence the court martial was adjourned until the following Monday.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{is shown}} to be {{as he would have}} been high up in the mountains, as a mortal and imperilled man. While this seems in some way demeaning to Napoleon's figure (and {{contrasts}} in the extreme with David's version, which shows Napoleon impervious to the cold, and in a heroic light), Delaroche's artwork was not intended to portray him in a hostile or unbecoming way. Delaroche wanted to depict Napoleon as a credible man, who suffered and underwent human hardship too, on his most daring exploits, and felt that making him appear as <b>he</b> <b>really</b> {{would have been in the}} situation would by no means debase or diminish Napoleon's iconic status or legacy, but rather make him a more admirable person.|$|E
5|$|On the April 5 {{episode of}} Impact!, Hardy was {{introduced}} {{as a member}} of Team Hogan for the annual Lethal Lockdown match, where they would face Team Flair. One week later, however, Hardy was injured when James Storm spewed a volatile liquid against a flame from his lighter, forming a fireball that singed most of Hardy's face. At Lockdown, Team Hogan (Hardy, Abyss, Jeff Jarrett and Rob Van Dam) defeated Team Flair (Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm). At Sacrifice, Hardy defeated Mr. Anderson. After the event, Anderson turned face and eventually managed to convince the skeptical Hardy that <b>he</b> <b>really</b> had changed, after which the two went on to form a tag team. At Slammiversary VIII, Hardy and Anderson, now known as Enigmatic Assholes, defeated Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm) in a tag team match.|$|E

5|$|Peter, Joe and Quagmire drag Cleveland {{to a bar}} {{to get him to}} {{meet some}} women, as he's still reeling from him and Loretta getting a divorce. It doesn’t work so well, so when The Bachelorette comes to Quahog, Peter takes Cleveland to {{audition}} for the show. Cleveland gets nervous at the audition and in an effort to calm him, Peter removes Cleveland’s clothes and then his own. The producers see this and Brian apologizes for what happened with Peter and Cleveland--Brian begins to explain how Cleveland and his wife recently divorced and how Cleveland's confused about what <b>he</b> <b>really</b> wants in a relationship.|$|E
5|$|Tariffs {{had been}} raised to high levels during the Civil War. Afterwards, Garfield, who made a close study of {{financial}} affairs, advocated moving towards free trade, though the standard Republican position was a protective tariff that would allow American industries to grow. This break with his party likely cost him his place on the Ways and Means Committee in 1867, and though Republicans held {{the majority in the}} House until 1875, Garfield remained off that committee during that time. Garfield came to chair the powerful House Appropriations Committee, but it was Ways and Means, with its influence over fiscal policy, that <b>he</b> <b>really</b> wanted to lead. Part of the reason Garfield was denied a place on Ways and Means was the opposition of the influential Republican editor, Horace Greeley.|$|E
5|$|The {{documentation}} of the various phrases of the construction {{makes no mention of}} anyone other than Bernardino delle Croci, {{but it is not clear}} if <b>he</b> <b>really</b> had the skills the create a sculptural structure of this type. A reappraisal of Brescian art of the period, as well as the clear evidence of the style, have led critics to assign to Cairano the execution of the stone parts of the monument, limiting delle Croci's involvement only to the bronze inserts. The jeweller, consequently, assumed the entire Martinengo commission but entrusted the parts outside his competence, most of the monument in fact, to the Cairano studio.|$|E
