5|$|Calling {{a correct}} letter earns the value before the {{corresponding}} flipper, {{multiplied by the}} number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle. Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money to <b>keep</b> <b>doing</b> so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E
5|$|Polio {{vaccination}} {{programs have}} received resistance from {{some people in}} Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria (the three countries with remaining polio cases). There is distrust surrounding vaccines in Pakistan as in 2011 the CIA organized a fake vaccination program {{in order to help}} find Osama Bin Laden. Additionally, some people believe that the vaccines are secretly being used for sterilization of Muslims. In 2015, the World Health Organization announced a deal with the Taliban to encourage them to distribute the vaccine in areas they control. However, on September 11, 2016, two unidentified gunmen associated with the Pakistani Taliban, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, shot Zakaullah Khan, a doctor who was administering polio vaccines in Pakistan. The leader of the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar claimed responsibility for the shooting and says that the group will continue to <b>keep</b> <b>doing</b> these kinds of attacks. This resistance to and skepticism of vaccinations has consequently slowed down the polio eradication process within the three remaining countries.|$|E

Illustrations had been a natural and essential aspect of the scientific periodical since the later seventeenth century. Engravings (cut into metal plates) were used for detailed illustrations, particularly where realism was required; while wood-cuts (and, from the early nineteenth century, wood-engravings) were used for diagrams, as they could be easily combined with letterpress.|$|E

500|$|Station to Station {{was voted}} the 13th best album of 1976 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, {{published}} by The Village Voice. Reviewing {{the record for}} the newspaper, Christgau expressed some reservations about the length of the songs and the detached quality of Bowie's vocals, but deemed [...] "TVC 15" [...] his [...] "favorite piece of rock and roll in a very long time" [...] and wrote, [...] "spaceyness has always been his shtick, and anybody who can merge Lou Reed, disco, and Dr. John... deserves to <b>keep</b> <b>doing</b> it for five minutes and 29 seconds."

In July 2017 it was announced that the film would be released on 8 November 2019. In August 2017 Craig confirmed that he would reprise his role as Bond.|$|E

[...] Producing for next generation machines, rather than a cheap upgrade, gave Bethesda an additional four years of development. Howard describes this as an aspect of Bethesda's greater goal of [...] "Reinvention", where the team's goal is to make [...] "a new game that stands on its own, that has its own identity". Howard spoke of the need to avoid repetition, to avoid merely adding [...] "some new features and content, and <b>keep</b> <b>doing</b> that", describing that path as [...] "a good way to drive your games into the ground." [...] Bethesda, Howard stated, would focus instead on recapturing what made its past titles exciting [...] "in the first place".|$|E
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] was {{directed}} by Miguel Sapochnik, who had directed the fifth-season episodes [...] "The Gift" [...] and [...] "Hardhome". In an Entertainment Weekly interview before the episode aired, Sapochnik said he was brought on board by Benioff and Weiss after his previous-season success; [...] "Hardhome" [...] won several awards, including Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. About how the episode should be shot, he said: [...] "Every battle on Thrones is unique. I think that's why Benioff and Weiss <b>keep</b> <b>doing</b> them. In the case of 'Battle of the Bastards' – or 'BOB' as we affectionately called it in production – David and Dan {{wanted to do a}} thing of spectacle, a strategic pitchfield battle they hadn't had the resources to do back in season 1 or 2. I was particularly interested in depicting both the horror of war and the role of luck in battle." [...] Benioff called Sapochnik's work on the episode some {{of the best in the}} series' history.|$|E
500|$|... "Here We Go Again" [...] is an uptempo power pop song, with guitar {{lines and}} pop hooks.

According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing, [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] {{is written in}} the time signature of common time, with a moderately fast tempo of 144 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of F major and Lovato's vocal range spans from the low-note of C3 to the high-note of F5. It has a basic sequence of F–Dm–Dm–Gm/B–F as its chord progression. The song's lyrics chronicle the protagonist's on-off relationship with an indecisive boy as she sings that [...] "Something about you is so addictive". Lovato explained: [...] "So it's about, basically, being in a relationship where you break-up and you make-up, and you break-up and it's like 'Here we go again, we just <b>keep</b> <b>doing</b> this over and over'." ...|$|E

If we <b>keep</b> <b>doing</b> that on our bad days, we will be in good shape." [...] The race result left Hamlin leading the Drivers' Championship with 5,230 points. Bowyer, who finished first, moved to second on 5,195, ten points ahead of Harvick and twenty-seven ahead of Kyle Busch. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet maintained the lead with 197 points. Toyota remained second with 165 points.

In September, the band supported Good Charlotte on their arena tour of the US.|$|E

500|$|The Wilson {{murder is}} a [...] "red ball", a police case {{involving}} an innocent victim, widely known suspects {{or a combination}} of the two. Red ball cases tend to draw attention from the media, the public and high-ranking police brass, and often result in additional detectives being added to the case. Fontana thought these elements of the red ball case would help produce a strong season premiere and tension among the veteran characters who resent the meddling of the new detectives. Julie Martin, one of the show's writers and supervising producers, said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] marked a deliberate change in the series, focusing on darker story lines that are [...] "a little messier and unresolved" [...] and more interpersonal relationships: [...] "The show's been on for six seasons, and it absolutely has to change. We can't <b>keep</b> <b>doing</b> the same show." [...] Media outlets noted that [...] "Blood Ties" [...] included more action-oriented elements such as car chases and a chase sequence involving helicopters at an airport. Fontana denied allegations of tampering from NBC executives and said any such changes would have come from him: [...] "I don't want us to have a style every week that we feel we have to conform to. ... I want people not to know what to expect when they tune in every week. We're not formulaic." ...|$|E
500|$|In Enron's {{natural gas}} business, the {{accounting}} had been fairly straightforward: in each time period, the company listed actual costs of supplying {{the gas and}} actual revenues received from selling it. However, when Skilling joined the company, he demanded that the trading business adopt mark-to-market accounting, citing that it would represent [...] "true economic value." [...] Enron became the first non-financial company to use the method to account for its complex long-term contracts. Mark-to-market accounting requires that once a long-term contract was signed, income is estimated as {{the present value of}} net future cash flow. Often, the viability of these contracts and their related costs were difficult to estimate. Due to the large discrepancies of attempting to match profits and cash, investors were typically given false or misleading reports. While using the method, income from projects could be recorded, although they might not have ever received the money, and in turn increasing financial earnings on the books. However, in future years, the profits could not be included, so new and additional income had to be included from more projects to develop additional growth to appease investors. As one Enron competitor stated, [...] "If you accelerate your income, then you have to <b>keep</b> <b>doing</b> more and more deals to show the same or rising income." [...] Despite potential pitfalls, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the accounting method for Enron in its trading of natural gas futures contracts on January 30, 1992. However, Enron later expanded its use to other areas in the company to help it meet Wall Street projections.|$|E
500|$|A billionaire socialite who dedicates {{himself to}} {{protecting}} Gotham City from its criminal underworld as a bat-masked vigilante who is hailed as its [...] "Dark Knight" [...] at night. Bale {{said he was}} confident in his choice to return in the role because of the positive response to his portrayal in Batman Begins. He continued training in the Keysi Fighting Method and performed many of his own stunts, but did not gain as much muscle {{as in the previous}} film because the new Batsuit allowed him to move with greater agility. Bale described Batman's dilemma as whether [...] " [...] something that has an end. Can he quit and have an ordinary life? The kind of manic intensity someone has to have to maintain the passion and the anger that they felt as a child, takes an effort after a while, to <b>keep</b> <b>doing</b> that. At some point, you have to exorcise your demons." [...] He added, [...] "Now you have not just a young man in pain attempting to find some kind of an answer, you have somebody who actually has power, who is burdened by that power, and is having to recognize the difference between attaining that power and holding on to it." [...] Bale felt Batman's personality had been strongly established in the first film, so it was unlikely his character would be overshadowed by the villains, stating: [...] "I have no problem with competing with someone else. And that's going to make a better movie." ...|$|E

50|$|An illusory promise, or {{one which}} the {{promisor}} actually has {{no obligation to}} <b>keep,</b> <b>does</b> not count as consideration. The promise must be real and unconditional. This doctrine rarely invalidates contracts; it is a fundamental doctrine in contract law that courts should try to enforce contracts whenever possible. Accordingly, courts will often read implied-in-fact or implied-in-law terms into the contract, placing duties on the promisor. For instance, if a promisor promises to give away {{a third of his}} earnings for the year and earns nothing, he has no actual obligation to do anything.|$|R
