40|$|Monotheism, {{by simple}} definition, implies {{a belief in}} one God for all peoples, not for one {{particular}} nation. But as the Shemah prayer recalls, God spoke exclusively to Israel in insisting that God is one. This address came to define the essential nature of the Jewish faith, setting it apart from all other faiths both in the pre-modern and modern worlds. This essay explores the positions {{of a variety of}} thinkers {{on the question of the}} exclusive status of monotheism in Judaism from the Renaissance until the present day. It first discusses the challenge offered to Judaism by the Renaissance thinker Pico della Mirandola and his notion of ancient theology which claimed a common core of belief among all nations and cultures. It then explores the impact of this universal philosophy of Christianity on a group of early modern Jewish thinkers; considers its repercussions among Jewish thinkers in the nineteenth century both in Western and Eastern Europe; and finally focuses on one contemporary <b>Jewish</b> <b>reflection</b> of the vision of Pico in our own day...|$|E

40|$|This essay {{tries to}} present a special face of the Jewish people {{in the history of}} man and world. As a key to {{understand}} the Jewish condition and identity I am using a well known notion of “the wandering Jew”. The counterpoint to a negative perception of this idea of Jews is a deep and real insight in their identity. This identity was shaped through the exceptional, consecutive encounters of Hebrews, Israelis, of the Jewish people with the unique God. He is unique also by the fact of their election and guidance on the way aiming to experience Him as the Lord full of love to them. This “knowing” of God occurs through the mutual relations between people and peoples. The fundamental feature of the Jewish condition is wandering, un-domestication which should result in breaking with these fetters and ties which make impossible our self-understanding which is a condition of a veritable freedom. This freedom is recognized in fulfilling one’ s vocation which starts with the election by God. The patriarchs of Israel – Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are the figures-icons useful in a better existential understanding of man and God. The Shoah which was so terrifying tragedy of Jews was a turning point for the <b>Jewish</b> <b>reflection</b> on their own vicissitudes, on the relation to God and the whole history. In the same time the Shoah was and should be fundamental to the contemporary civilization as well as to Christians and Churches in perceiving their vocation and mission.

40|$|MY ACADEMIC HISTORY {{has been}} a hodgepodge of what some might {{consider}} incongruous parts, and I have been pulled between the constituents of that history. In college, I remember being struck by the differences between two courses addressing the “problem of evil”: in one, a religion professor assigned complex <b>Jewish</b> <b>reflections</b> on the absence of God in the Shoah; in another, an analytic philosopher of religion offered an array of distinctions I found instructive yet difficult to grasp. I wanted to bring these traditions together, but my fumbling attempts often left {{one side or the}} other disappointed. That may happen again in this article, but I am glad for the chance to reflect on the relationship between the dis-ciplines of philosophy and theology. Debating the merits of “analytic theology ” is challenging: whether you are about it depends heavily on how you define the terms in question, and perhaps also on whether the philosophy of religion, mind, action, etc. you may have read lately has inspired optimism! My main suggestion here is that insofar as it protests bad habits and misconceptions in aca-demic theology I am happy to join the analytic theological chorus—but what theology needs is not more modifiers, movements, or parties but to be more forthrightly and less defensively itself (homeless and in-between the times as that can and may be) ...|$|R

Law enforcement officials, as well as longtime union members and mob associates (often the same thing in the NMDU) say that Levine cleverly allowed each of the city's five Mafia families to have a piece of the newspaper delivery action, which included bootleg sales of stolen papers as well as loan-sharking and gambling among drivers." ...|$|R

40|$|A novidade do Deus cristão apresentado por Jesus Cristo é a Trindade. Sem contradizer o monoteísmo judeu, a reflexão para formulação dogmática se estendeu por quatro séculos. Sucessivamente, a Trindade foi tema esquecido na Igreja por 1. 600 anos. Sua importância está sendo redescoberta não somente na liturgia, mas, também, na vida e na reflexão eclesial. A unidade no amor dos Três distintos, Pai, Filho e Espírito Santo, estimula a espiritualidade e a vivência do cristão de hoje. Para tanto, é necessário o auxílio das ciências humanas, que permitem a atualização da linguagem do dogma sem a perda do seu conteúdo fundamental. A reflexão do teólogo napolitano Bruno Forte dá uma grande contribuição para a teologia atual, respeitando a formulação dogmática e, ao mesmo tempo, buscando categorias e linguagens apropriadas para a compreensão do homem contemporâneo. A Trindade de Deus tem algo importante a dizer para o ser humano de hoje a respeito de si mesmo, pois que feito “à imagem e semelhança de Deus” (Gn 2, 26). Palavras-chave : Trindade. Pai. Filho. Espírito Santo. Amor.   Abstract The Holy Trinity is {{the novelty}} of God {{presented}} by Jesus Christ. Without contradicting <b>Jewish</b> monotheism, the <b>reflection</b> for a dogmatic formulation lasted for four centuries. Subsequently, {{the issue of the}} trinity was forgotten in the Church for 1, 600 years. The importance of this issue is currently being rediscovered not only in the liturgy but also in life and ecclesial reflection. The unity in love {{on the part of the}} three distinct persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, stimulates spirituality and experience of the Christians today. To do so, one needs the assistance of the humanities that allow the update of the dogma of language without losing its essential content. The reflection of the Neapolitan theologian Bruno Forte is of great value to the current theology because it respects the dogmatic formulation and also uses categories and languages appropriate to an understanding of contemporary man. The Trinity of God has something important to say about the man himself because man was created as God’s image. (Gn 2, 26). Keywords : Trinity. Father. Son. Holy Spirit. Love. </p...|$|R
40|$|From the 1880 's {{until the}} Second World War, New York and Warsaw were the magnets {{for the largest}} Jewish {{migration}} in history and the crucible of a new mass culture in Yiddish. Most significant as a purveyor of Jewish media and agent of modernization was the Yiddish press, which brought the changing world directly into Jewish homes and hands, both within the greater metropolis and beyond. Satire was {{the order of the}} day in this volatile new media, packaged for the first time in parodic holiday supplements, humor columns, joke pages, and [...] -most popular of all [...] -cartoons and caricatures. Visual parody in Jewish culture was coterminous with modernity. Heretofore, drawing without a religious connotation was a communal taboo. Since the 13 th century, moreover, visual parody had been the domain of vicious anti-Jewish caricature which, by the 18 th and 19 th centuries, had become socially and racially oriented. Antisemitic caricatures were by now standard fare in the satirical presses of both Europe and America. The cartoonists of the Yiddish press, therefore, were not only engaged in a radical subversion of Jewish tradition but also in a graphic reassessment of pre-existing Jewish caricature. Contextualized within the comfort of their own language and in their own press, Yiddish cartoonists drew their own taxonomy of cartoon Jews that were not mired in a one-dimensional stereotype, creating an alternative picture gallery that mirrored the diversity of the Jewish world. As visual parody became a standard feature of the Yiddish press, specialized cartoon genres began to appear produced by a new class of professional cartoonists: harsh political and social commentary, raucous visual parodies, and celebrity spoofs all presented in one panel to multi-panel comic strips. Most popular were holiday-related cartoons, which were among the first to appear in both the Old and New World press. This use of traditional material in cartoon form, ranging from Biblical quotation to sacred objects, from law to lore, helped fashion a multi-layered Jewish cartoon space that catered to different audiences at one and the same time. This dissertation traces the creation of cartoon media within the Yiddish humor press in New York and Warsaw. It also analyzes how and why cartoonists infused this media with <b>Jewish</b> content. A <b>reflection</b> of the anxieties and destabilization of mass migration and modernization, the cartoons of the Yiddish press also anchored their audiences within the familiar world of Jewish texts and traditions.
