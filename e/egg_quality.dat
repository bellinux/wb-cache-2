40|$|Poor <b>egg</b> shell <b>quality</b> can be {{very costly}} to the broiler industry. Egg shell defects are {{problematic}} because they reduce {{the total number of}} hatched chicks. In addition to decreased hatachability, egg shell cracks can also contaminate other eggs with pathogens during incubation. Microbial contamination f hatching eggs can lead to the resultant chicks being regarded as poor quality with an increased occurrence of morbidity and mortality during the couple weeks of the growout. Poor <b>egg</b> shell <b>quality</b> is known to be more prevalent with older hens laying in a environment with high temperatures. Altering the feeding program may be a means of improving <b>egg</b> shell <b>quality.</b> <b>Egg</b> size is known to increase as hens advance with age. Because the egg shell is being formed around a larger area, egg shell thickness may be decreased in larger eggs. One strategy to help control egg size may be to reduce the protein and/or methionine content of the diet during the latter phase of production. What is a Breeder II Feed? When is it Fed?

5000|$|Forced molting, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} induced molting, is the practice by some poultry industries of artificially provoking a flock to molt simultaneously, typically by withdrawing food for 7-14 days and sometimes also withdrawing water {{for an extended}} period. Forced molting is usually implemented when egg-production is naturally decreasing {{toward the end of}} the first egg-laying phase.
