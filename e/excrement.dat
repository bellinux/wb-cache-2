5|$|Whales defecate at the ocean's surface; their <b>excrement</b> is {{important}} for fisheries because it is rich in iron and nitrogen. The whale faeces are liquid and instead of sinking, they stay at the surface where phytoplankton feed off it.|$|E
5|$|Dung beetles form spherical {{balls of}} animal <b>excrement,</b> which they roll with their bodies, {{generally}} by walking backwards and pushing {{the ball with}} their rear legs. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in ancient Egyptian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face {{many of the same}} mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.|$|E
40|$|Shape, preservation, {{embedded}} {{components and}} groundmass characteristics allow distinction between herbivore <b>excrements</b> and the coprolites of omnivores or carnivores. Herbivore dung remains may {{occur in a}} wide range of onsite archaeological features but are also known from offsite situations. Fresh herbivore <b>excrements</b> are usually porous, loosely packed and consist mainly of poorly digested to undigested plant fragments, which are sometimes embedded in a brown to dark brown amorphous organic groundmass. Ruminant and horse <b>excrements</b> mainly consist of poorly digested plant fragments. Rodent <b>excrements</b> can be found in archaeological sediments. Because of the high organic content of herbivore <b>excrements,</b> dried ruminant dung is an excellent fuel, used since prehistoric times and still in use today, mainly in dry regions. Stabling or enclosure sediments have a lower porosity than equivalent unaffected <b>excrements</b> and show an impact of sediment agglomerates, mineral grains and other components due to trampling processes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCoprophilic {{fungi in}} the water from six {{different}} water bodies were studied between 1995 – 1997. For hydrochemical analysis samples of water were collected every three months while for estimation of fungus content every month. <b>Excrements</b> of 3 phytophagous (greylag goose, roman-nosed goose, mute swan), 4 carnivorous (grey heron, white stork, marsh harrier, cormorant) and 3 omnivorous bird species (musk-duck, mallard, black-headed gull) were used as bait. Thirty-six fungus species growing on avian <b>excrements</b> {{in the water}} of all examined water bodies were found, 6 of these species belonged to Chytridiomycetes and 30 to Oomycetes. The largest number of fungus species was detected on <b>excrements</b> of musk duck, mallard and mute swan, the smallest one on <b>excrements</b> of roman-nosed goose, marsh harrier and cormorant. Such fungus species as Achlya americana, Aphanomyces laevis, Dictyuchus monosporus, Pythium debaryanum, Pythium rostratum, Saprolegnia asterophora, Saprolegnia ferax and Saprolegnia parasitica were detected on <b>excrements</b> of all birds examined. Out of these 36 species, 11 are known as parasites or necrotrophs of fish. Rhizophydium ampullaceum and Diasporangium jonesianum are reported {{for the first time}} from Poland...|$|R

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1929, the Mufti Haj Amin Al Husseinni ordered an opening be made at the {{southern}} end of the alleyway which straddled the Wall. The former cul-de-sac became a thoroughfare which led from the Temple Mount into the prayer area at the Wall. Mules were herded through the narrow alley, often dropping <b>excrement.</b> This, together with other construction projects in the vicinity, and restricted access to the Wall, resulted in Jewish protests to the British, who remained indifferent.|$|E
5|$|Scent plays a {{significant}} role in olfactory communication. Cheetahs often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then the male will itself urinate there and sniff at its own scent before leaving. Other observing individuals will repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behaviour but less prominently than the males. Females in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and her <b>excrement</b> can attract males from far off.|$|E

In. i. B. marci, P. holosericea. /i. the effect of temperature on assimilation efficiency was studied. In. i. P. holosericea. /i. assimilation efficiency decreased with increasing temperature. This trend was not observed in. i. B. marci. B. marci. /i. was fed on pure cellulose to test if cellulose can serve as the only source of energy.

40|$|The {{population}} dynamics of Salmonella enterica var. Typhimurium MAE 110 gfp, Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 gfp, and Pseudomonas fluorescens 32 gfp were investigated in their introduction to cattle <b>excrements</b> and subsequent entering the soil, plants of cress (Lepidium sativum L.), and migration through the gastroenteric tract of French snails (Helix pomatia L.). The survival of these {{bacteria in the}} <b>excrements</b> and soil was investigated at cyclically changing (day-night, 25 – 15 °C) and constant (18 °C) temperatures. The cyclically changing temperature adversely affected the survival of E. coli O 157 :H 7 gfp, and P. fluorescens but did not influence S. enterica var. Typhimurium. All the bacteria and, especially, the analogues of enteropathogens showed high survival in the cattle and snail <b>excrements,</b> soil, and on the plants under the gradual decrease in their population.

5|$|After {{several months}} he spent as an {{experimental}} case, military authorities began {{to press for}} Tarrare {{to be returned to}} active duty. Dr. Courville was keen to continue his investigations into Tarrare's eating habits and digestive system, and approached General Alexandre deBeauharnais with a suggestion that Tarrare's unusual abilities and behaviour could be put to military use. A document was placed inside a wooden box which was in turn fed to Tarrare. Two days later, the box was retrieved from his <b>excrement,</b> with the document still in legible condition. Courville proposed to deBeauharnais that Tarrare could thus serve as a military courier, carrying documents securely through enemy territory with no risk of their being found if he were searched.|$|E
5|$|An {{epidemic}} of dysentery broke {{out on the}} Kokoda Track that threatened the entire force. Some 1,200 casualties, mostly dysentery, reached Ilolo in September. Simple hygiene procedures involving the disposal of rubbish and <b>excrement</b> were required, but were neglected {{in the early stages}} of the campaign. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford arranged for supplies of a new drug, sulphaguanidine, to be shipped from Australia. The widespread use of a scarce drug was a gamble, as it used up all the stocks in Australia, but one that paid off; it arrested the epidemic, and allowed sick men to travel, thereby saving lives. When the Australians advanced on Kokoda in October, special details constructed latrines, buried the dead, and, in extreme cases, burned villages that the Japanese had fouled beyond redemption.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, faeces {{and urine}} are {{considered}} as noxious and unhealthy. In ancient times, however, urine and <b>excrements</b> {{were seen as}} undangerous and even useful; urine for textile production and <b>excrements</b> for agriculture. The Romans constructed sewers like the Cloaca Maxima, {{in the first place}} to remove (rain) water and drainage. Only later, toilets were connected to these sewers to remove the smell of urine and <b>excrements.</b> The idea that sewers were constructed with the specific aim of removing urine and <b>excrements</b> is therefore no longer valid, but the memory of this function of the (Roman) sewers was maintained in the Middle Ages. From the Renaissance onwards, city planners developed their ‘ideal cities’. In these cities, there was no place for the dirty smell of urine and <b>excrements,</b> so subterranean sewers had to be constructed. Yet such ideas proved difficult to implement in the Dutch context. The Dutch engineer Simon Stevin realised that the situation described by the ancient and Renaissance sources did not offer a solution for the problems in Dutch cities, with standing water in canals and without natural drainage. Moreover, in this period there was not yet an awareness of the relation between the presence and smell of urine and <b>excrements,</b> on the one  hand, and hygiene and public health on the other. Awareness of this relation came not earlier than the 18 th century. The German physician Johann Peter Frank argued in favour of diminishing the bad smell by  means of filling up canals; the city physician Willem Frederik Büchner was confronted with the extremely unhealthy situation in the typical Dutch city of Gouda. But their political influence was small. Only {{at the end of the}} 19 th century, the construction of sewers began in Dutch cities, thus – improving health conditions. </p...|$|R
5|$|Many {{species of}} birds are {{economically}} important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds (poultry and game) being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. Guano (bird <b>excrement)</b> is harvested {{for use as a}} fertiliser. Birds prominently figure throughout human culture. About 120–130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching {{is an important part of}} the ecotourism industry.|$|E
5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{people of}} the earlier Roman period lived in small, {{unprotected}} villages, populated each by a few dozen residents at most, made up of several houses, usually set partially below the ground level (semi-sunken), each covering an area of 8–22 square meters. They knew how to dig and build wells, so the settlements didn't have to be located near bodies of water. Thirteen 2nd century wells with variously constructed timber lined walls were found at a settlement in Stanisławice, Bochnia County. Fields were being used for crop cultivation {{for a while and}} then as pastures, when animal <b>excrement</b> helped the soil regain fertility. Once iron share plows were introduced the fields were alternated between tillage and grazing.|$|E
5|$|The Sumatran rhino is {{a mostly}} solitary animal except for {{courtship}} and offspring-rearing. It {{is the most}} vocal rhino species and also communicates through marking soil with its feet, twisting saplings into patterns, and leaving <b>excrement.</b> The species is much better studied than the similarly reclusive Javan rhinoceros, {{in part because of}} a program that brought 40 Sumatran rhinos into captivity with the goal of preserving the species. There was little or no information about procedures that would assist in ex situ breeding. Though a number of rhinos died once at the various destinations and no offspring were produced for nearly 20 years, the rhinos were all doomed in their soon to be logged forest. In March 2016, a Sumatran rhinoceros was spotted in Indonesian Borneo.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} folk tales about the Sumatran rhino were {{collected}} by colonial naturalists and hunters from the mid-19th century to early 20th century. In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that {{the best time to}} hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, it was said that the rhino's horn was hollow and {{could be used as a}} sort of hose for breathing air and squirting water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it under the ground. In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating in a stream, it would turn around and eat fish that had been stupefied by the <b>excrement.</b>|$|E
5|$|Carpet beetles {{are members}} of the family Dermestidae, and while the adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen, the larvae are {{destructive}} pests in homes, warehouses and museums. They feed on animal products including wool, silk, leather, fur, the bristles of hair brushes, pet hair, feathers and museum specimens. They tend to infest hidden locations and may feed on larger areas of fabrics than do clothes moths, leaving behind specks of <b>excrement</b> and brown, hollow, bristly-looking cast skins. Management of infestations is difficult and is based on exclusion and sanitation where possible, resorting to pesticides when necessary. The beetles can fly in from outdoors and the larvae can survive on lint fragments, dust and inside the bags of vacuum cleaners. In warehouses and museums, sticky traps baited with suitable pheromones can be used to identify problems, and heating, freezing, spraying the surface with insecticide and fumigation will kill the insects when suitably applied. Susceptible items can be protected from attack by keeping them in clean airtight containers.|$|E

5|$|Like all Phallus species, P.indusiatus is saprobic—deriving {{nutrients}} from breaking down wood and plant organic matter. The fruit bodies grow singly or in groups in disturbed ground and among wood chips. In Asia, it grows among bamboo forests, and typically fruits after heavy rains. The {{method of reproduction}} for stinkhorns, including P.indusiatus, is different from most agaric mushrooms, which forcibly eject their spores. Stinkhorns instead produce a sticky spore mass that has a sharp, sickly-sweet odor of carrion. The cloying stink of mature fruit bodies—detectable from a considerable distance—is attractive to certain insects. Species recorded visiting the fungus include stingless bees of the genus Trigona, and flies of the families Drosophilidae and Muscidae. Insects assist in spore dispersal by consuming the gleba and depositing <b>excrement</b> containing intact spores to germinate elsewhere. Although {{the function of the}} indusium is not known definitively, it may visually entice insects not otherwise attracted by the odour, and serve as a ladder for crawling insects to reach the gleba.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{of clothes}} moths (mainly Tineola bisselliella and Tinea pellionella) feed on fabrics and carpets, {{particularly}} those that are stored or soiled. The adult females lay batches of eggs on natural fibres, including wool, silk and fur, as well as cotton and linen in blends. The developing larvae spin protective webbing and chew into the fabric, creating holes and specks of <b>excrement.</b> Damage is often concentrated in concealed locations, under collars and near seams of clothing, in folds and crevices in upholstery and round the edges of carpets as well as under furniture. Methods of control include using airtight containers for storage, periodic laundering of garments, trapping, freezing, heating {{and the use of}} chemicals; mothballs contain volatile insect repellents such as 1,4-Dichlorobenzene which deter adults, but to kill the larvae, permethrin, pyrethroids or other insecticides may need to be used.|$|E
