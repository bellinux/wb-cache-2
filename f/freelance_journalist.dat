It discovered the skills, working life and professional identity of <b>freelance</b> <b>journalists</b> continue to be shaped by an industry undergoing rapid change.

Perhaps most importantly, the project provided evidence that <b>freelance</b> <b>journalists</b> could create a viable and rewarding career in the 21 st century...|$|R

40|$|Title: Palestinian <b>freelance</b> <b>journalists</b> - self-censorship, {{customers}} and {{role in society}} Number of pages: 67 Authors: Linnea Fridh and Jens Wingren Mentor: Gabriella Sandstig Course: Bachelor thesis, Journalism studies Period: Spring 2015 University: Faculty of Journalism, Media and Communication (JMG) University of Gothenburg Purpose/ Aim: The aim {{of the study is}} to map and analyse the working conditions, possibilities and limitations of Palestinian <b>freelance</b> <b>journalists</b> [...] Main results: By analysing the answers of our respondents we have concluded that the main possibility with the working conditions of Palestinian <b>freelance</b> <b>journalists</b> is their flexibility. As long as they are financially safe (for example from working another job) they can be more straightforward and uncompromising in their journalism. <b>Freelance</b> <b>journalists</b> are however limited by the financial scarcity of the Palestinian media that don’t pay them enough and offer lacking support. Feeling excluded from the union is also something that specifically affects the <b>freelance</b> <b>journalists</b> and might make them feel more vulnerable. There is therefore a slight paradox inherent in the situation of the Palestinian freelancer: they have the opportunity to do good and critical journalism, but only if they can support themselves financially in some other way. Another finding {{of this study is that}} <b>freelance</b> <b>journalists</b> may alter their implications of professional ideals such as objectivity and neutrality when they work with foreign news desks. Working with this kind of customers also provides a way of expressing oneself with less fear of repercussions from differing factors in Palestinian society that might want to silence dissent...|$|R

40|$|Research key {{question}} is: How do the working conditions look like for Swedish <b>freelance</b> <b>journalists</b> living and serving abroad? The {{aim was to}} investigate how Swedish <b>freelance</b> <b>journalists</b> abroad themselves view their work and their working conditions. From wages and working hours to work and press freedom are discussed. Qualitative research {{interviews were conducted with}} four Swedish <b>freelance</b> <b>journalists</b> based abroad. One serving in the Middle East, one in India, one in France and one in Finland. It has been a gender balance of respondents. The responses of the four journalists have been processed based on a qualitative content analysis. The key that have emerged during the research is that <b>freelance</b> <b>journalists</b> enjoy to plan the working day as they wish, be able to settle wherever they want and travel a lot as the benefits of their working conditions. The disadvantages described is the insecurity regarding supplies, not getting a fair price, the loneliness that occurs without co-workers, and the risks that exist when reporting from war-torn countries without an editorial staff that stands behind it.

5|$|Alisa Smith and J. B. MacKinnon's idea {{of local}} eating began while visiting their cabin in {{northern}} British Columbia in August 2004. Their food supplies were nearly exhausted so {{to feed their}} dinner guests they scrounged the surrounding land for food. Their dinner of Dolly Varden trout, wild mushrooms, dandelion leaves, apples, sour cherries, and rose hips, along with potatoes and garlic from the garden, so impressed the couple that once back home, in their Kitsilano apartment in Vancouver, they pursued the idea of eating only local food. They eventually decided to try a diet consisting of eating food, for one year, grown within 100 miles of their home. They began the diet symbolically {{on the first day}} of spring, March 21. Beginning in June, they wrote articles for The Tyee about their experience. The couple, both in their 30s, each had experience in writing: Smith as a <b>freelance</b> <b>journalist</b> who had taught non-fiction writing, and MacKinnon as the author of the award-winning historical non-fiction book Dead Man in Paradise and a past editor of Adbusters magazine.|$|E

50|$|In 2008 {{following}} a BBC corporation wide review led by Mark Byford, BBC News introduced new money-savings contracts.

Under the new contract, it was {{proposed that the}} BBC would only buy the required pieces, while restricting contracted freelancers solely to working for BBC News. Brabant led the orchestrated opposition, which resulted in him and other <b>freelance</b> <b>journalists</b> being allowed to sell the non-required pieces to other news organisations.

40|$|The {{future of}} journalism is threatened. This is what emerges in a {{considerable}} amount of literature provided for journalism students. Most of the research concerning the future of journalists applies only to those who have a permanent employment at a media company and not to <b>freelance</b> <b>journalists.</b> This study focuses on the freelance journalists’ views on their work today and their thoughts on the future challenges of journalism, based on the aspects described in literature. Through a questionnaire survey the <b>freelance</b> <b>journalists</b> have answered to what extent they agree with the statements contained in the literature. Subsequently, some of these statements got further explanations through personal interviews with the respondents. The results show that <b>freelance</b> <b>journalists</b> by and large agree with the statements in the literature. Technology and economy are the main factors affecting content, working conditions and production. <b>Freelance</b> <b>journalists</b> agree that journalism and the journalist role are changing and they are somewhat more likely to agree to the claims related to the future than to the present. Despite the negative aspects and the turbulent times that characterize journalism and the future, of which the freelancers are highly aware, they believe in the future of journalism in one form or another. They are skeptical about the assertion of journalism's downfall and they hope there will soon be a backlash effect to the development as of today.
