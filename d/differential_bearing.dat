40|$|The overall {{requirements}} {{necessary for}} sensing bearing distress {{and the related}} criteria to select a particular rotating sensor were established during the phase I. The current phase II efforts performed studies to evaluate the Robustness and Durability Enhancement of the rotating sensors, and to design, and develop the Built-in Telemetry System concepts for an aircraft engine differential sump. A generic test vehicle that can test the proposed bearing diagnostic system was designed, developed, and built. The Timken Company, who also assisted with testing the GE concept of using rotating sensors for the <b>differential</b> <b>bearing</b> diagnostics during previous phase, was selected as a subcontractor to assist General Electric (GE) for the design, and procurement of the test vehicle. A purchase order was prepared to define the different sub-tasks, and deliverables for this task.

40|$|A {{technique}} is described for sensing relative spatial orientations of approach and target vehicles, using optical phase mensuration (in the interferometric sense, {{as opposed to}} LIDAR), {{in place of the}} more conventional intensity, image, or transit time measurements. This approach permits the parameters to be measured with great accuracy with relatively simple, small sensors having no moving components. A suite of sensors operating on this principle can produce all desired data using either active detection on the target or passive retroreflection to the detectors on the approach vehicle. These optical phase measurements can be applied to determine bearing angle (location of the target vehicle in the approach vehicle coordinates), range, and attitude (orientation of the target vehicle with respect to the line-of-sight). The first two quantities require the approach vehicle to project a modulated interference pattern into space. The bearing angle is determined for a selected point on the target by measuring the phase of the interference pattern at that point using either a detector on the target or a retroreflector on the target and a detector at the transmitter. The range is found by measuring <b>differential</b> <b>bearing</b> angles to predetermined relative instrumentation sites. Two interferometers, a coarse and a fine ranger are required to resolve the 2 pi ambiguity...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. 1. To {{determine}} {{the presence of}} mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in rat embryo limb buds and adult rat knee joints. 2. To {{determine the}} pharmacological effects of recombinant human GDF- 5 (rhGDF- 5) on rat MSCs. 3. To {{determine the effect of}} rhGDF- 5 on load bearing in a rodent model of osteoarthritis. Methods. Fluorescent-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) was used to identify and purify MSCs from E 18 rat embryo and adult rat knee cartilage. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to assess the RNA profile of MSCs. qRT-PCR was specifically used to quantify the expression of chondrogenesis markers including Aggrecan (Agc), Type II collagen (Col 2), and Sox 9 and osteogenesis markers including Runx 2 and Type I collagen. An Alamar Blue (AB) assay was utilized to assess effects of rhGDF- 5 on MSC proliferation. An Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) assay was used to study the effects of rhGDF- 5 on MSC differentiation. Neuroprobe migration chambers were used to assess rhGDF- 5 effects on chondrocyte chemotaxis. In situ hybridization (ISH) was conducted to identify MSC (expression of chondrogenic RNA biomarkers) in rat embryos and in adult knee joints from normal and osteoarthritic rats. <b>Differential</b> weight <b>bearing</b> analysis was assessed using Bioseb's DWB system. Results. MSCs were obtained from E 18 rat embryo limb buds and adult rat knee joint cartilage. qRT-PCR showed that MSC comprised pre-osteochondrocytes expressing Agc, Col 2 a 1, Sox 9, and GDF- 5 RNAs. rhGDF- 5 treated MSC showed a dose-dependent increase in AB intensity from Day 1 to Day 14, followed by an increase in rhGDF- 5 mediated ALP activity on Day 14 and Day 21. The increased ALP activity coincided with increased Agc, Col 2 a 1, Sox 9, and GDF- 5 RNA expression indicating that rhGDF- 5 selectively promoted chondrogenesis. Greater chemotaxis effect of rhGDF- 5 was observed with MSC that presumably were more differentiated after 23 days in culture with rhGDF- 5. Following 23 days of treatment with rhGDF- 5, MSC appeared as condensations and precartilaginous structures. ISH confirmed the presence of GDF- 5, Sox 9, and Runx 2 in rat embryo hind limbs and in the experimentally-induced osteoarthritic joint of adult animals. DWB analysis revealed significant differential joint loading in the Medial Meniscus Tear (MMT) injured knee, but no reverse <b>differential</b> weight <b>bearing</b> was detected in rhGDF- 5 treated rats after a 9 -week treatment period. Conclusion. Mesenchymal stem cells are present in rat embryonic limb buds and adult rat knee joint. Our studies show that rhGDF- 5 may promote an increase in metabolic activity of MSCs prior to commitment to the chondrocyte lineage. The positive chemotaxic effect of GDF- 5 suggests a role in MSC cell homing, cell condensation, and formation of pre-cartilaginous structures. Taken together, GDF- 5 is a selective chondrocyte differentiation factor. The presence of MSC in the damaged joint suggests that rhGDF- 5 may act to differentiate endogenous MSC to chondrocytes...|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} we {{investigate}} {{a mathematical model}} describing the growth of tumor {{in the presence of}} immune response of a host organism. The dynamics of tumor and immune cells is based on the generic Michaelis-Menten kinetics depicting interaction and competition between the tumor and the immune system. The appropriate phenomenological equation modeling cell-mediated immune surveillance against cancer is of the predator-prey form and exhibits bistability within a given choice of the immune response-related parameters. Under the influence of weak external fluctuations, the model may be analyzed in terms of a stochastic <b>differential</b> equation <b>bearing</b> the form of an overdamped Langevin-like dynamics in the external quasi-potential represented by a double well. We analyze properties of the system within the range of parameters for which the potential wells are of the same depth and when the additional perturbation, modeling a periodic treatment, is insufficient to overcome the barrier height and to cause cancer extinction. In this case the presence of a small amount of noise can positively enhance the treatment, driving the system to a state of tumor extinction. On the other hand, however, the same noise can give rise to return effects up to a stochastic resonance behavior. This observation provides a quantitative analysis of mechanisms responsible for optimization of periodic tumor therapy in the presence of spontaneous external noise. Studying the behavior of the extinction time {{as a function of the}} treatment frequency, we have also found the typical resonant activation effect: For a certain frequency of the treatment, there exists a minimum extinction time.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} a monumental change in tort liability law, the Federal Employers 2 ̆ 7 Liability Act (FELA) of 1908. This shift from common law, by changing the way injured workers were compensated and the compensating wage <b>differentials</b> for risk <b>bearing,</b> set the stage for workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation and other no-fault systems. Focusing on the New Jersey railroad system, the authors examine three periods: the pre-FELA years of 1900 - 1908; 1909 - 11, when the FELA laws were the only changes in the common laws affecting some railroad workers; and 1912 - 16, when both FELA and workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation laws affected railroad workers.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveInvestigate a {{role for}} {{calcitonin}} gene-related peptide (CGRP) in osteoarthritis (OA) -related pain. DesignNeutralizing antibodies to CGRP were generated de novo. One of these antibodies, LY 2951742, was characterized in vitro and tested in pre-clinical in vivo models of OA pain. ResultsLY 2951742 exhibited high affinity to both human and rat CGRP (KD of 31 and 246  pM, respectively). The antibody neutralized CGRP-mediated induction of cAMP in SK-N-MC cells in vitro and capsaicin-induced dermal blood flow in the rat. Neutralization of CGRP significantly reduced pain behavior as measured by weight <b>bearing</b> <b>differential</b> in the rat monoiodoacetate model of OA pain in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, pain reduction with neutralization of CGRP occurred independently of prostaglandins, since LY 2951742 and NSAIDs worked additively in the NSAID-responsive version of the model and CGRP neutralization remained effective in the NSAID non-responsive version of the model. Neutralization of CGRP also provided dose-dependent and prolonged (> 60 days) pain reduction in the rat meniscal tear model of OA after only a single injection of LY 2951742. ConclusionsLY 2951742 is a high affinity, neutralizing antibody to CGRP. Neutralization of CGRP is efficacious in several OA pain models and works independently of NSAID mechanisms of action. LY 2951742 holds promise {{for the treatment of}} pain in OA patients...|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 17 - 26 This paper {{explains}} how synchronous rotor instability {{can occur in}} high speed turbomachinery due to <b>differential</b> heating of <b>bearing</b> journals. Theoretical investigations have indicated that rotors supported by fluid-film bearings inherently exhibit a nonuniform temperature distribution around the bearing journal circumference (Keogh and Morton, 1993, 1994). This thermal effect results in rotor bending, which in combination with an overhung mass, such as couplings and overhung impellers, can significantly increase rotor unbalance and thus, synchronous rotor vibration. Under certain conditions, it can even lead to synchronous rotor instability. In this paper, a case history on synchronous rotor instability is presented, concerning two pipeline compressors for a natural gas application. The compressors successfully passed an API 617 mechanical running test in the manufacturer's workshop. However, installed at site, the rotor behavior of these machines was completely unstable. The vibration analysis indicated {{that the cause of}} the instability was likely to be thermal in origin. However, ordinary labyrinth seal rubbing could be excluded. One of the compressor cartridges was returned to the manufacturer's workshop for a detailed examination and an extensive test program. It appeared that rotor instability was caused by differential heating of the impeller-end bearing journal, which could not be reduced by modification of the bearing parameters. Eventually, a heat barrier sleeve was designed to prevent thermal bending of the rotor at this location. Additional testing confirmed the expected effect and, after installation in the field, the unstable behavior of both machines was completely eliminated...|$|R

40|$|T-slide linear {{actuators}} use gear <b>bearing</b> <b>differential</b> epicyclical transmissions (GBDETs) to directly drive a linear rack, which, in turn, performs the actuation. Conventional systems use a rotary power source {{in conjunction with}} a nut and screw to provide linear motion. Non-back-drive properties of GBDETs make the new actuator more direct and simpler. Versions of this approach will serve as a long-stroke, ultra-precision, position actuator for NASA science instruments, and as a rugged, linear actuator for NASA deployment duties. The T slide can operate effectively in the presence of side forces and torques. Versions of the actuator can perform ultra-precision positioning. A basic T-slide actuator is a long-stroke, rack-and-pinion linear actuator that, typically, consists of a T-slide, several idlers, a transmission to drive the slide (powered by an electric motor) and a housing that holds the entire assembly. The actuator is driven by gear action on its top surface, and is guided and constrained by gear-bearing idlers on its other two parallel surfaces. The geometry, implemented with gear-bearing technology, is particularly effective. An electronic motor operating through a GBDET can directly drive the T slide against large loads, as a rack and pinion linear actuator, with no break and no danger of back driving. The actuator drives the slide into position and stops. The slide holes position with power off and no brake, regardless of load. With the T slide configuration, this GBDET has an entire T-gear surface on which to operate. The GB idlers coupling the other two T slide parallel surfaces to their housing counterpart surfaces provide constraints in five degrees-of-freedom and rolling friction in the direction of actuation. Multiple GB idlers provide roller bearing strength sufficient to support efficient, rolling friction movement, even in the presence of large, resisting forces. T-slide actuators can be controlled using the combination of an off-the-shelf, electric servomotor, a motor angle resolution sensor (typically an encoder or resolver), and microprocessor-based intelligent software. In applications requiring precision positioning, {{it may be necessary to}} add strain gauges to the T-slide housing. Existing sensory- interactive motion control art will work for T slides. For open-loop positioning, a stepping motor emulation technique can be used...|$|R
40|$|The {{level of}} {{susceptibility}} to tuberculosis (TB) infection depends upon allelic variations in numerous interacting genes. In our mouse model system, the whole-genome quantitative trait loci (QTLs) scan revealed three QTLs involved in TB control on chromosomes 3, 9, {{and in the}} vicinity of the H 2 complex on chromosome 17. For the present study, we have established a panel of new congenic, MHC-recombinant mouse strains <b>bearing</b> <b>differential</b> small segments of chromosome 17 transferred from the TB-susceptible I/St (H 2 j) strain onto the genetic background of TB-resistant C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) mice (H 2 b). This allowed narrowing the QTL interval to 17 Ch: 33, 77 - 34, 34 Mb, containing 36 protein-encoding genes. Cloning and sequencing of the H 2 j allelic variants of these genes demonstrated profound polymorphic variations compare to the H 2 b haplotype. In two recombinant strains, B 6. I- 249. 1. 15. 100 and B 6. I- 249. 1. 15. 139, recombination breakpoints occurred in different sites of the H 2 -Aβ 1 gene (beta-chain of the Class II heterodimer H 2 -A), providing polymorphic variations in the domain β 1 of the Aβ-chain. These variations were sufficient to produce different TB-relevant phenotypes: the more susceptible B 6. I- 249. 1. 15. 100 strain demonstrated shorter survival time, more rapid body weight loss, higher mycobacterial loads in the lungs and more severe lung histopathology compared to the more resistant B 6. I- 249. 1. 15. 139 strain. CD 4 + T cells recognized mycobacterial antigens exclusively in the context of the H 2 -A Class II molecule, and the level of IFN-γ-producing CD 4 + T cells in the lungs was significantly higher in the resistant strain. Thus, we directly demonstrated for the first time that the classical H 2 - Ab 1 Class II gene is involved in TB control. Molecular modeling of the H 2 -Aj product predicts that amino acid (AA) substitutions in the Aβ-chain modify the motif of the peptide-MHC binding groove. Moreover, unique AA substitutions in both α- and β-chains of the H 2 -Aj molecule might affect its interactions with the T-cell receptor (TCR) ...|$|R
