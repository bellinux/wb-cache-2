5|$|Copeland {{returned}} to her mother's home and frequent arguments. Her mother had long resented the Bradleys' influence and soon decided that Copeland would cease study with the Bradleys. Copeland was distraught with fear {{that she would not}} be able to dance. She had heard the term emancipation while in San Francisco; the procedure was common among young performers to secure their financial and residential independence. The Bradleys introduced Copeland to Steven Bartell, a lawyer who explained the emancipation petition process. The Bradleys encouraged her to be absent from home when the emancipation petition was delivered to her mother. Copeland ran away from home for three days and stayed with a friend, while Bartell filed the emancipation papers. After her mother reported Copeland missing, she was told about the emancipation petition. Three days after running away, Copeland was {{returned to}} her mother by the police. DelaCerna engaged lawyer <b>Gloria</b> <b>Allred</b> and applied for a series of restraining orders, which included the Bradleys' five-year-old son, who had been Copeland's roommate, and Bartell. The order was partly intended to preclude contact between the Bradleys and Copeland, but it did not have proper legal basis, since there had been no stalking and no harassment.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Taylor {{started having}} {{troubles}} {{in his personal}} life again. On November 8, {{he was arrested in}} Miami-Dade County, Florida for leaving the scene of an accident after striking another vehicle with his Cadillac Escalade. He had already committed the same offense in 1996 when he totaled his Lexus in a one-car accident and left the scene, saying he did not think the law required the reporting of a single driver incident. He was released on a $500 bond, and the other driver later sued him, seeking $15,000. He was arrested six months later for having sex with a 16-year-old girl at a Holiday Inn located in Montebello, New York. He was charged with felony third-degree statutory rape, for allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with someone under 17. He was also charged with third-degree patronization for allegedly paying the underage girl $300 to have sex with him. The girl was represented by celebrity attorney <b>Gloria</b> <b>Allred</b> when Taylor pleaded guilty on March 22, 2011 and was sentenced to six years probation as part of a plea agreement, in which he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanors of sexual misconduct and patronizing a prostitute. He will also have to register as a low-risk level one sex offender. On October 26, 2012, a court rejected the victim's claims that Taylor assaulted her.|$|E

25|$|A {{grassroots}} campaign called #EndRapeSOL {{was started}} by feminist and LGBT rights activist Ivy Bottini and Dr. Caroline Heldman, who are pushing {{for an end to}} the statute of limitations around the country.

25|$|Most of {{the alleged}} acts fall outside the {{statutes}} of limitations for criminal legal proceedings, but criminal {{charges have been filed}} against Cosby in one case and numerous civil lawsuits have been brought against him. As of November 2015, eight related civil lawsuits are active against Cosby. <b>Gloria</b> <b>Allred</b> is representing 33 {{of the alleged}} victims. In July 2015, some of the court records from Andrea Constand's 2005 civil lawsuit against Cosby were unsealed and released to the public. The full transcript of his deposition was also released to the media by a court reporting service. In his testimony, Cosby admitted to casual sex, involving recreational use of the sedative-hypnotic methaqualone (Quaaludes), with a series of young women, and acknowledged that his dispensing the prescription drug was illegal.|$|E
500|$|In news {{coverage}} that aired in January 2005 of {{the filming of}} the rodeo scene, Bobby Rowe, producer of the Salem, Virginia rodeo depicted in the film, provided background on how he had become {{the victim of a}} hoax.

500|$|People who {{criticized the}} song's message {{included}} Ellen Goodman, a national syndicated columnist, {{who called the}} video [...] "a commercial for teenage pregnancy". Feminist lawyer <b>Gloria</b> <b>Allred,</b> the spokeswoman of the National Organization for Women (NOW), angrily called for Madonna to make a public statement or another record supporting the opposite point of view. Alfred Moran, {{the executive director of}} Planned Parenthood of New York City, also criticized the song, fearing that it would undermine efforts to promote birth control among adolescents and that it would encourage teenage pregnancy. Recalling how his agency's clinics were filled in 1985 with girls wearing clothes that were an imitation of Madonna's style, Moran said that the song's message is [...] "that getting pregnant is cool and having the baby is the right thing and a good thing and don't listen to your parents, the school, anybody who tells you otherwise—don't preach to me, Papa. The reality is that what Madonna is suggesting to teenagers is a path to permanent poverty." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 26, 2016, Judge Craig Kaplan {{refused to}} dismiss the {{majority}} of Huth's lawsuit; However he did dismiss a 'negligent infliction of emotional distress' claim.

2500|$|The defense criticized lawyer <b>Gloria</b> <b>Allred,</b> who {{represents}} several of Cosby's accusers, stating that Allred's [...] "campaign against Mr. Cosby builds on racial bias and prejudice that can pollute {{the court of}} public opinion." [...] Allred responded by calling the claim [...] "desperate". She said that Cosby [...] "complains about racial bias but what about the African American women whom I represent who accuse him of sexual assault or rape and who refuse to remain silent about what they say they have suffered?" [...] and [...] "This is not an issue of racial bias. Instead, it is an {{issue of whether or not}} Mr. Cosby has committed acts of gender sexual violence." ...|$|E

[...] Brauchler said he does not want any victim denied a fair hearing because of Colorado's statute, but [...] "I don't have a magic number". Any change would have to be done carefully, he said, because the more time that passes between an alleged sex assault and prosecution, the harder it is for the accused to defend themselves.
