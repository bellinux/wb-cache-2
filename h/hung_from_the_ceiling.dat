5|$|Following {{his success}} in Sydney, Jackson was tapped to direct the audio design and {{production}} at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where he directed the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony. His sound design for BC Place Stadium did not have loudspeakers at ground level aimed up at the seating areas—Jackson determined that this approach would produce too much uncontrolled reverberation from sound waves bouncing off the ceiling. Instead, he configured two rings of loudspeakers <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> 100ft (30m) above the ground, aimed downward. The inner ring held 8 arrays each composed of 12 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers and the outer ring held 12 arrays of 7 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers, augmented by 16 subwoofers. The lot was powered by 160 Lab.gruppen amplifiers which were also <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and were networked via Dante in a triple-redundant configuration. Two DiGiCo D5 digital mixing consoles served as main and backup for the main audience sound, and two Yamaha PM1Ds handled main and backup duties for monitor mixing. Other equipment included dual-redundant Optocore fibre connections, two Dolby Lake Processors, and time code generated by two pairs of Fairlights which also handled audio cues timed to the action on the field.|$|E
25|$|The Durbar Hall of {{the palace}} which houses the {{furniture}} used by the Nawab has a crystal chandelier <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> It is the second largest chandelier in the world, after one in Buckingham Palace. It {{was given to the}} Nawab by Queen Victoria.|$|E
25|$|They {{made other}} major {{changes to the}} interior. The mayor's office was moved from the second floor to the first. On the third floor they built a vast council meeting room, with space for 400. More {{decoration}} {{was added to the}} walls, and ornate lights <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|E
50|$|In vintages {{where the}} climate {{conditions}} are favorable, the grapes maybe {{left on the}} vine to desiccate and further concentrate the sugars well into January. They could also be harvested earlier and left to dry inside special drying rooms where they are may be <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> or spread out on mats to dry.|$|R
50|$|In 1936-1937, {{the school}} {{district}} took advantage of federal Public Works Administration funds to add two classrooms, hallways, and restrooms. Heat for the rooms was provided by a boiler system, which replaced the wood-burning stoves used in the original classrooms. The intact boiler room {{is located in a}} small subfloor area underneath the boys’ restroom. The rooms were eventually equipped with oil heaters, and eventually gas heaters <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b>|$|R
50|$|The park's caves, {{limestone}} formations {{and rugged}} bluffs represent {{a step back}} in geological time of thousands of years. Stalactites once <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> and stalagmites rose <b>from</b> <b>the</b> floor. Souvenir hunters have robbed the caves of this rare beauty, but many formations remain. The park's limestone caves, arches and chimneys including Dancehall Cave, Hernado's Hideaway, Shinbone Cave, Wye Cave, and an unmarked cave within the Dancehall Cavern locally known as Steelgate Cave.|$|R
25|$|The North American Iroquois tribes used masks {{for healing}} {{purposes}} (see False Face Society). In the Himalayas, masks functioned above all as mediators of supernatural forces. Yup'ik masks could be small three-inch finger masks, but also ten-kilo masks <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> or carried by several people. Masks {{have been created}} with plastic surgery for mutilated soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Jackson also {{purchased}} three cut-glass chandeliers {{to light}} the room. Each chandelier, which featured 18 whale oil lamps, <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> medallions and were complimented with whale oil wall sconces and table lamps. There were also 20 spittoons. His expenditures totaled $9,358.27, provided by a friendly Congress eager to make the White House a more elegant symbol of the nation.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{painting}} flat canvases, Klein {{produced a}} series of works throughout his career that blurred the edges between painting and sculpture. He appropriated plaster casts of famous sculptures, such as the Winged Victory of Samothrace and the Venus de Milo, by painting them International Klein Blue; he painted a globe, 3D reliefs of areas of France and dowels which he <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> as rain; He also stuck sponges to canvases and painted dinner plates. Many of these works were later manufactured as editioned multiples after his death.|$|E

60|$|The {{work was}} as badly done as the servant was surly and disagreeable; {{in the corners}} of the rooms there were {{collected}} heaps of dust; spiders' webs <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> and in front of the window-panes; the beds were hardly ever made, and the feather beds, so beloved by the old and feeble cats, had never once been shaken since Lizina left the house. At Father Gatto's next visit he found the whole colony in a state of uproar.|$|R
50|$|The child-god Krishna and {{his friends}} used to form human pyramids to break pots <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> of {{neighbourhood}} houses, in order to steal curd and butter. This was in Vrindavan, a village in Uttar Pradesh, India, where Krishna was brought up. There was ample amount of cows and milk products made that time. He used to distribute it among his friends because during King Kamsa's rule (his maternal uncle), their parents were forced to give everything produced to Kamsa's home in Mathura. The children of Vrindavan village were thus deprived of milk products.|$|R
25|$|Gallery no. 7 is the Durbar Hall. It is {{the center}} {{attraction}} of the palace cum museum. It is circular in plan and has four doors at the cardinal points, some of which-as mentioned above-are fake. The Durbar also has a vaulted roof with the crystal chandelier (as discussed above, is perhaps the second {{largest in the world}} after the one at the Buckingham Palace) <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> It was presented to the Nawab by Queen Victoria. Earlier when there was no electricity the chandelier was lit by 1001 candles; at present it is lit by 96 bulbs. In addition, one can see the royal silver throne which was used by the Nawabs to sit, a Durbari Hookah, marble candle stands, all of them witnesses of the British Colonial Rule.|$|E
25|$|Since modern {{thyristors}} {{can switch}} {{power on the}} scale of megawatts, thyristor valves have become the heart of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) conversion either to or from alternating current. In the realm of this and other very high-power applications, both electrically triggered (ETT) and light-triggered (LTT) thyristors are still the primary choice. The valves are arranged in stacks usually suspended from the ceiling of a transmission building called a valve hall. Thyristors are arranged into a diode bridge circuit and to reduce harmonics are connected in series to form a 12-pulse converter. Each thyristor is cooled with deionized water, and the entire arrangement becomes one of multiple identical modules forming a layer in a multilayer valve stack called a quadruple valve. Three such stacks are typically mounted on the floor or <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the valve hall of a long-distance transmission facility.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} bout was {{the last}} match in the Terri Invitational Tournament, contested between The New Brood (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy) and Edge and Christian in a tag team ladder match. For the match, a bag with 100,000 dollars was <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and {{the goal of the}} match was to use one of the two ladders in the ring to climb and retrieve the bag. The first team to retrieve the bag would win the match. The manager of The New Brood, Gangrel brought a ladder to the ring, but as a result, he got ejected from ringside by the referee. During the match, the ladders were set up so that one was on top of the other, resembling a Seesaw, Jeff jumped on one side so that the other side jutted upwards, knocking down both Matt and Christian. Later in the match, all four men were on the ladders and after Edge pushed Matt off of the ladder they were both on, he fell into the other ladder, knocking Christian to the mat. Jeff however, jumped onto the other ladder to continue to battle with Edge. As Jeff and Edge climbed the ladder, Jeff pushed Edge to the ground and grabbed the bag of money to win the match. As a result of winning the match, The New Brood won $100,000 and the managerial services of Terri Runnels. Backstage, the trio celebrated the win and their new partnership with a bottle of champagne.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{buildings}} were destroyed in the fire of 1828, only descriptions of the living areas of the fort are available. All the state halls in {{the buildings}} {{are said to have}} doorways with exquisitely carved teak arches, with ornamental teardrop teak pillars shaped like Suru (cypress tree) trunks supporting <b>the</b> <b>ceilings,</b> which were covered with beautiful teak tracery, carved creepers and flowers. Exquisite glass chandeliers <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b> <b>The</b> floors were made of highly polished marble, arranged in a mosaic pattern and adorned with rich Persian rugs. The walls contained paintings with scenes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Hindu epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.|$|R

25|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} woman in a fine white and blue satin dress with gold trimmings. She sits on a platform a step higher than the black and white marble floor, her right foot on a terrestrial globe and her right hand on her heart as she looks up, adoringly, at a glass sphere <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> by a blue ribbon. Her left arm rests {{on the edge of a}} table which holds a golden chalice, a large book, and a dark-wood crucifix. Behind the crucifix is a gilt-leather panel screen. Beneath the book is a long piece of cloth, possibly a priest's stole. Resting on top of the book is a crown of thorns. All of these items are on the platform, which is covered by a green and yellow rug, the edge of which is on the floor. At the bottom of the picture, nearer the viewer, is an apple, and nearer still a snake which has been squashed by a cornerstone. On the dim, far wall behind the woman, a large painting of Christ's crucifixion is hung on the wall behind the woman. To the viewer's left is a multicolored tapestry, pulled back at the bottom and seemingly the closest thing in the painting to the viewer. A chair with a blue cloth on it is immediately beneath and behind the tapestry and to the left of the snake and cornerstone.|$|E
500|$|The show {{included}} many references such as to James Brown and Donna Summer {{as well as}} routines inspired by Sweet Charity and Marilyn Monroe. It opened in darkness, with Knowles emerging {{through a hole in}} the stage amidst smoke, sparkles and pyrotechnics to perform [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] with a snippet of Gnarls Barkley's [...] "Crazy" [...] in a sparkling silver gown and walking to the front of the stage, as fifteen disco balls <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Her background band started playing the music to the funk song and while singing, Knowles walked up a huge staircase which moved forward in two places where her all-female band and three backup singers were positioned.

50|$|The $9.5 million {{expansion}} in 2002 added 25000 sq ft {{of space to}} the building, bringing it {{to a total of}} 105000 sq ft. The new gymnasium has its own bathrooms and office space (with a private shower) for the school gym teacher, who previously operated out of a closet. The school library space was extended by 10 ft and a skylight was installed in it. New windows and hallway tiles were installed, along with 32 in television monitors <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> of every classroom. Storage areas were converted into new, large music and art classrooms. A computer lab with 32 Imac computers was added to the library, and a science computer lab with 16 computers was also added as part of the renovations. The project was designed and built by architects Strekelodsky & Hoit of Hingham and AMG Construction of Stoughton.|$|R
50|$|A {{serpentine}} streamer {{is a type}} {{of party}} accessory made out of long strips of paper, wound up in a roll. When thrown up in the air they create beautiful serpentines, and their motion through air is fun and aids in party cheerfulness. Serpentine streamers can also be used as party decorations, usually <b>hung</b> up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> across <b>the</b> room, as they form visually appealing serpentines.|$|R
500|$|Onstage Beyoncé had an all-female band, and {{the show}} used men only as dancers for the female {{audience}} as noted by Pareles of The New York Times.

500|$|West {{demonstrated}} {{an affinity for}} the arts at an early age; he began writing poetry when he was five years old. His mother recalled that she first took notice of West's passion for drawing and music {{when he was in}} the third grade. Growing up in Chicago, West became deeply involved in its hip hop scene. He started rapping in the third grade and began making musical compositions in the seventh grade, eventually selling them to other artists. At age thirteen, West wrote a rap song called [...] "Green Eggs and Ham" [...] and began to persuade his mother to pay $25 an hour for time in a recording studio. It was a small, crude basement studio where a microphone <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> by a wire clothes hanger. Although this wasn't what West's mother wanted, she nonetheless supported him. West crossed paths with producer/DJ No I.D., with whom he quickly formed a close friendship. No I.D. soon became West's mentor, and it was from him that West learned how to sample and program beats after he received his first sampler at age 15.|$|E
500|$|The series premiered at a {{red carpet}} event on January 26, 2017, in West Hollywood's Pacific Design Center.

Running for three days from the premiere in a Williamsburg warehouse, the free-to-the-public exhibit featured artwork from Michael Murphy, Clemens Behr, Kumi Yamashita, and David Flores that looked to [...] "challenge audiences’ minds": Murphy's sculpture, Suspension of Disbelief, features [...] "hundreds of colorful utilitarian objects" [...] <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> that, when looked at from a specific spot, form the word [...] "Legion"; Behr's installation, Doors, is [...] "the corridor of a hospital that’s been blown apart", allowing visitors to walk [...] "between fragments of rooms and doorways strewn with mirror fragments"; Yamashita created Lovers, silhouettes of David Haller and Syd Barrett that are separated, [...] "preventing the figures from clasping hands", which [...] "greets visitors at the show’s entrance"; and Flores' mural Legion, [...] "being used as the key art for the show, depicts a fiery explosion emanating from David’s mind." [...] Limited edition posters inspired by this artwork were made available at 56 comic book stores across the U.S. The exhibit also included a multimedia installation inspired by the series.|$|E
50|$|There are {{no known}} {{photographs}} of the Titanic staircase, but many survive of the Olympic, which is presumed to have been similar. In 1990 a huge trove of woodwork <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Olympic {{was found in a}} barn in the North of England, much of it belonging to the Grand Staircase. These pieces retained the Avocado green color they had been painted in the 1932 refit, and included large amounts of wall paneling, carved newel posts, window frames, cornice-work, and doors. Portions of <b>the</b> oak banisters <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Aft Grand Staircase grace the staircase of the White Swan Hotel in Alnwick, England. The chandeliers which once <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> of <b>the</b> Staircase occasionally come up for auction - 16 were auctioned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Haltwhistle Paint Factory in 2004. This auction also included the Olympic four landscape oil paintings <b>from</b> <b>the</b> B,C,D and E-Deck landings, along with <b>the</b> communicating doors <b>from</b> <b>the</b> two Boat-Deck entry vestibules.|$|R
50|$|Armstrong spared {{no expense}} in the {{building}} of his Auditorium. Its external walls were made of emerald onyx. The walls in the outer lobby were made of a rare pink onyx, and they contained expensive chandeliers, including two that had been owned by the Shah of Iran, <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gilt <b>ceilings.</b> In <b>the</b> concert hall, the walls were decorated with rosewood, so delicate that visitors were forbidden to take flash photographs.|$|R

Fenzileh reclined upon a divan that was spread with silken Turkey carpets, {{and one of her}} gold-embroidered slippers had dropped from her henna-stained toes. Her lovely arms were raised to support her head, and she stared up at the lamp of many colours that <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fretted <b>ceiling.</b>|$|R
500|$|In 1876, city {{officials}} discussed what role the bell should {{play in the}} nation's Centennial festivities. Some wanted to repair it so it could sound at the Centennial Exposition being held in Philadelphia, but the idea was not adopted; the bell's custodians concluded that {{it was unlikely that}} the metal could be made into a bell which would have a pleasant sound, and that the crack had become part of the bell's character. Instead, a replica weighing [...] (1,000pounds for each of the original states) was cast. The metal used for what was dubbed [...] "the Centennial Bell" [...] included four melted-down cannons: one used by each side in the American Revolutionary War, and one used by each side in the Civil War. That bell was sounded at the Exposition grounds on July 4, 1876, was later recast to improve the sound, and today is the bell attached to the clock in the steeple of Independence Hall. While the Liberty Bell did not go to the Exposition, a great many Exposition visitors came to visit it, and its image was ubiquitous at the Exposition grounds—myriad souvenirs were sold bearing its image or shape, and state pavilions contained replicas of the bell made of substances ranging from stone to tobacco. In 1877, the bell was <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the Assembly Room by a chain with thirteen links.|$|E

500|$|Although the huia's {{range was}} {{restricted}} to the southern North Island, its tail feathers were valued highly and were exchanged among tribes for other valuable goods such as pounamu and shark teeth, or given as tokens of friendship and respect. Through this trade, the feathers reached the far north and the far south of New Zealand. They were stored in intricately carved boxes called waka huia, which were <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> of chiefs' houses. Huia feathers were worn at funerals and used to decorate {{the heads of the}} deceased. The marereko, described by Edward Robert Tregear as an [...] "ancient war-plume", consisted of twelve huia feathers. The highly valued pōhoi was an ornament made <b>from</b> <b>the</b> skin of the huia: the bird was skinned with the beak, skull and wattles attached and the legs and wings removed, carefully dried, and the resulting ornament worn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> neck or ears. Dried huia heads were also worn as pendants called ngutu huia. A captured huia would be kept in a small cage so that its tail feathers could be plucked as they grew to full size.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the {{significant}} obstacles to success, more than 300,000 important print volumes, 18,000 reels of microfilm, and 629,711 archival items {{affected by the}} storm were salvaged and restored through a highly technical and elaborate process. Tulane University established the Libraries Recovery Center in 2008 to sort the restored items, check them against the library’s historic catalogue, create an inventory of materials unaccounted for, and return the materials to the library’s collections. In 2013, this task was still ongoing. [...] The Howard-Tilton Memorial Library reopened in spring 2006 {{for the start of}} the first post-Katrina semester. At that point, a battery of temporary HVAC units were being used to combat mold and humidity by distributing air throughout each floor by long semi-inflated tubes <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> and attached through the windows along the back of the building to eight galvanized metal towers. In August 2013, plans were announced to replace these climate control systems with a more permanent solution, as well as to add a 5th and 6th floor to the library. The completion date is scheduled for Fall 2015. The basement of the Howard-Tilton Memorial Library remains gutted and empty, as does the basement level in Jones Hall.|$|R
