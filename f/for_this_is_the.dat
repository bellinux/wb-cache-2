5|$|Extant bats of Puerto Rico {{belong to}} five {{families}} (Noctilionidae, Mormoopidae, Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae, and Molossidae) {{and include a}} total of 13 species, of which six subspecies are endemic to the archipelago. Seven of the 13 species are insectivores, four can be considered frugivores, one species feeds on nectar and another on fish. The species total is a relatively low number {{in comparison to the}} other Greater Antilles. Jamaica, for example, with an area approximately 1.2 times that of Puerto Rico, has 21 species (1.6 times that of Puerto Rico). A possible explanation <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> comparatively large distance between the archipelago and the mainland dispersion areas. Jamaica, for example, is closer to Cuba and Hispaniola which are themselves closer to the mainland dispersion areas of North and Central America.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 the Treaties of Rome {{established}} two, similar, communities {{creating a}} common market (European Economic Community) and promoting atomic energy co-operation (Euratom). The three institutions shared the Court of Justice and the Parliament, however {{they had a}} separate Council and High Authority, which was called the Commission in these Communities. The reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> different relationship between the Commission and Council. At the time the French government was suspicious of the supranationalism and wanted to limit {{the powers of the}} High Authority in the new Communities, giving the Council a greater role in checking the executive.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the reason}} <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{extensive}} freeway system in the city, due {{to the majority of}} that system being funded by local, rather than federal funds, through a half-cent general sales tax measure approved by voters in 1985. Another offshoot of this local funding is that Phoenix is the largest city in the United States to have two Interstate Highways but no three-digit interstates.|$|E
25|$|The main tool {{they adopted}} <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>The</b> Open Source Definition.|$|R

25|$|Steam {{locomotives}} are categorised {{by their}} wheel arrangement. The two dominant systems <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Whyte notation and UIC classification.|$|R
25|$|Some {{observers}} {{have noted that}} the protests against the Iraq War have been relatively small-scale and infrequent compared to protests against the Vietnam War. One of the most often cited factors <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> lack of conscription.|$|E
25|$|In each {{of these}} areas, there is {{considerable}} debate as to the optimal treatment. One of the major reasons <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> lack of large-scale clinical trials comparing different treatments. Smaller trials {{tend to be less}} reliable and hence may produce conflicting results.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Isenberg's 1984 {{study of}} senior {{managers}} {{found that their}} decisions were highly intuitive. Executives often sensed {{what they were going}} to do before they could explain why. He claimed in 1986 that one of the reasons <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> complexity of strategic decisions and the resultant information uncertainty.|$|E
50|$|Another reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{development}} of a Soviet second strike capability, {{in the form of}} silo-based ICBMs and later SLBMs.|$|R
50|$|<b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> root of our tongue’s sorrow, the lumbay ng dila: that {{whatever}} we taste, and say, is not--and cannot be--fully ours.|$|R
30|$|The team-related {{challenges}} {{rise from}} the space system development: <b>the</b> main reasons <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> standards and the ways of working in the distributed settings.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the success}} of the Theory of Special Relativity, there are still detractors who insist on the {{existence}} of the aether. The basis <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> experiment performed by Georges Sagnac that produced the Sagnac effect. However, this effect has been proven to reconcile with Special Relativity.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the exact}} date of Pisanello's medal is not known, most writers hold {{that it is}} {{more likely to have been}} made in Ferrara rather than Florence. One reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{existence}} of a letter dated 12 May 1439 in which Pisanello is promised payment from a church in Mantua, near Ferrara.|$|E
25|$|Dinosaurs' limbs were erect {{and held}} under their bodies, rather than {{sprawling}} {{out to the}} sides like those of lizards and newts. The evidence <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> angles of the joint surfaces and the locations of muscle and tendon attachments on the bones. Attempts to represent dinosaurs with sprawling limbs result in creatures with dislocated hips, knees, shoulders and elbows.|$|E
50|$|Hosts <b>for</b> <b>this</b> year <b>were</b> <b>the</b> artist Linnea Henriksson, Swedish rapper Petter {{and radio}} {{presenter}} Kodjo Akolor. Travelling reporter <b>for</b> <b>this</b> edition <b>was</b> <b>the</b> blog- & TV-personality William Spetz, and destination <b>for</b> <b>this</b> year's travel <b>was</b> Mozambique.|$|R
50|$|Another way of {{preparing}} Cinnamic acid <b>is</b> by <b>the</b> Knövenaegel-Hans condensation reaction. <b>The</b> reactants <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> corresponding benzaldehyde and malonic acid {{in the presence}} of a weak base, followed by acid hydrolysis.|$|R
50|$|But above all, for {{the first}} time since 1980, <b>the</b> Bavarian {{champion}} <b>was</b> directly promoted again, now to the Regionalliga. <b>The</b> one exception <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> year 2000, when the number of Regionalligas was reduced from four to two.|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} named species of {{bacteria}} and archaea (approximately 13,000) is surprisingly small considering their early evolution, genetic diversity and residence in all ecosystems. The reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> differences in species concepts between the bacteria and macro-organisms, {{the difficulties in}} growing/characterising in pure culture (a prerequisite to naming new species, vide supra) and extensive horizontal gene transfer blurring the distinction of species.|$|E
25|$|The part of {{the army}} that did not go with Guthrum mostly went on to more settled lives in Northumbria and York. Some may have settled in Mercia. Evidence <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{presence}} of two Viking cemeteries in modern-day Derbyshire that {{are believed to be}} connected to the Great Army, at Repton and at Heath Wood.|$|E
25|$|Among the marginalised groups, STs are at {{the bottom}} of the rankings, further emphasising the lack of social {{development}} in the state. Bastar and Dantewada in south Chhattisgarh are the most illiterate districts and the drop out ratio is the highest among all the districts. The reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> extreme poverty in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{operation}} of the new Czechoslovak government was distinguished by its political stability. Largely responsible <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> well-organized political parties that emerged as the real centers of power. After 1933, Czechoslovakia remained the only democracy {{in central and eastern}} Europe.|$|R
25|$|One of <b>the</b> reasons <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> high {{probability}} of aftershocks (over 50 percent {{according to the}} USGS). Just weeks after the first quake, <b>the</b> region <b>was</b> rattled again by a 7.3 magnitude quake and there were also many considerable aftershocks.|$|R
50|$|A {{music video}} was {{produced}} to promote <b>the</b> single, <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Jacksons' very first video. It features the five brothers wearing white suits and dancing on a stage. It {{was released on}} DVD for the bonus disc of Michael Jackson's Vision.|$|R
25|$|Galileo Galilei {{is said to}} {{have dropped}} two cannonballs of {{different}} masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass. However, the only primary source <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> biography Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei), written by Galileo's secretary Vincenzo Viviani and published in 1717, long after Viviani's death.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, more {{experienced}} detectives cut their teeth at divisions {{and then moved}} into the crime squads. However the last 10 years has seen a switch in that progression, in that many junior detectives first obtain positions at the sometimes easier to fill Crime Department positions and then later moving onto divisional work. One major reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> travel and often heavy hours involved in working within metropolitan Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the {{obligations}} of the husband include providing for his wife. He is obligated to provide for her sustenance for her benefit; in exchange, he is also entitled to her income. However, this is a right to the wife, and she can release her husband of the obligation of sustaining her, and she can then keep her income exclusively for herself. The document that provides <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ketuba.|$|E
50|$|From 2003 to 2008, Germany (a {{nation with}} only 80 million inhabitants) <b>was</b> <b>the</b> world's strongest exporter. In 2009, China (1.3 billion inhabitants) overtook Germany in exports. One of <b>the</b> reasons <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Hidden Champions {{as a result}} of the German Model.|$|R
25|$|The Black Death, {{a plague}} that ravaged Europe from 1347 to 1351 did not {{significantly}} affect Poland, and <b>the</b> country <b>was</b> spared from a major outbreak of the disease. <b>The</b> reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> decision of Casimir the Great to quarantine the nation's borders.|$|R
3000|$|The {{communication}} {{between science and}} decision makers is not a structured activity but usually takes place only when public opinion raises some concerns about an argument or {{when there is a}} risk or an emergency to <b>be</b> managed. <b>The</b> main reasons <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> following: [...]...|$|R
25|$|The Whole Duty of Man is an English high church 'protestant' devotional work, first {{published}} anonymously, with an introduction by Henry Hammond, in 1658. It was both popular and influential for two centuries, in the Anglican tradition {{it helped to}} define. The title is taken from Ecclesiastes 12:13, in the King James Version of the Bible: Let us hear {{the conclusion of the}} whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> whole duty of man.|$|E
25|$|However, {{starting}} in the latter 20th century, most of area’s economy has shifted away from agriculture. One reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> deterioration of the area’s environment. Plagues and poor planning have gravely affected the conservation area in Xochimilco, {{to the extent that}} many fruit trees traditionally grown here have disappeared, including capulins and peaches. Over the last forty years, the percentage of people in the borough working in agriculture has dropped from forty percent to three percent.|$|E
25|$|In birds, males {{often have}} a more {{colourful}} appearance and may have features (like the long tail of male peacocks) {{that would seem to}} put the organism at a disadvantage (e.g. bright colors would seem to make a bird more visible to predators). One proposed explanation <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> handicap principle. This hypothesis says that, by demonstrating he can survive with such handicaps, the male is advertising his genetic fitness to females—traits that will benefit daughters as well, who will not be encumbered with such handicaps.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{the terms}} of the treaty, all aspects of the Treaty of Madrid <b>were</b> repealed. <b>The</b> reasons <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> {{difficulties}} encountered in the 1750s to establish a clear border between the Spanish and Portuguese new South American possessions in such an enormous undeveloped area.|$|R
50|$|Dominica has a {{relatively}} large number of centenarians. As of March 2007, there are 22 centenarians out of the island's 70,000 inhabitants—three times the average incidence of centenarianism in developed countries. <b>The</b> reasons <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> subject of current research being undertaken at Ross University School of Medicine.|$|R
