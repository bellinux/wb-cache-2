5000|$|Night vision systems {{enabled the}} {{measurement}} of visual thresholds following World War II. The 1950s also marked a time of notable development in the performance modeling of night vision imaging systems. From 1957 to 1958, Johnson, a United States Army Night Vision & Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) scientist, was working to develop methods of predicting target detection, orientation, recognition, and identification. Working with volunteer observers, Johnson used <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> <b>equipment</b> to measure the volunteer observer's ability to identify scale model targets under various conditions. His experiments produced the first empirical data on perceptual thresholds that was {{expressed in terms of}} line pairs. In the first Night Vision Image Intensifier Symposium in October 1958, Johnson presented his findings in a paper entitled [...] "Analysis of Image Forming Systems", which contained the list that would later be known as Johnson's criteria.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the success}} and {{longevity}} of the AN/PVS-4 {{was due to the}} MX-9644 <b>Image</b> <b>Intensifier</b> tube. To make the tube more usable with simple optics, a second-generation MCP based <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> was adapted to an electrostatic inverter, similar to a first-generation <b>image</b> <b>intensifier.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of flat-panel detectors {{allows for the}} replacement of the <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> in fluoroscope design. [...] Flat panel detectors offer increased sensitivity to X-rays, and therefore have the potential to reduce patient radiation dose. Temporal resolution is also improved over <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers,</b> reducing motion blurring. Contrast ratio is also improved over image intensifiers: flat-panel detectors are linear over a very wide latitude, whereas <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> have a maximum contrast ratio of about 35:1. Spatial resolution is approximately equal, although an <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> operating in 'magnification' mode may be slightly better than a flat panel.|$|R

40|$|We are {{developing}} a high precision full-field range imaging system. An integral component in this system is an <b>image</b> <b>intensifier,</b> which is modulated at frequencies up to 100 MHz. The range measurement precision is dictated by the <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> performance, in particular, the achievable modulation frequency, modulation depth, and waveform shape. By characterizing the <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> response, undesirable effects can be observed and quantified {{with regards to the}} consequence on the resulting range measurements, and the optimal operating conditions can be selected to minimize these disturbances. The characterization process utilizes a pulsed laser source to temporally probe the gain of the <b>image</b> <b>intensifier.</b> The laser is pulsed at a repetition rate slightly different to the <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> modulation frequency, producing a continuous phase shift between the two signals. A charge coupled device samples the <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> output, capturing the response over a complete modulation period. Deficiencies in our measured response are clearly identifiable and simple modifications to the configuration of our electrical driver circuit improve the modulation performance...|$|R

The <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> is exhibiting deterioration in sensitivity associated with extended use and {{is in need of}} replacement...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{method has}} been {{developed}} to evaluate the noise of x-ray <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers.</b> Fast electronics and a fast photomultiplier tube (PMT) are optically coupled to the output of an x-ray <b>image</b> <b>intensifier.</b> The light emission induced in the intensifier by the absorption of x-ray photons is measured by counting single PMT photoelectrons. The fluc-tuation {{in the number of}} counted PMT photoelectrons per absorbed monochromatic x-ray photon {{is a measure of the}} noise of the x-ray <b>image</b> <b>intensifier.</b> It is characterized by an effi-ciency factor called DQEscin whose values have been obtained from PMT count distributions for five x-ray energies. Experimental results reveal that the output signal-to-noise ratio of the x-ray <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> under study is reduced by no more than 10 % as expected from the efficiency factor DQEscin...|$|R

40|$|Night vision devices, such <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> and {{infrared}} imagers, {{are readily available}} {{to a host of}} nations, organizations, and individuals through international commerce. Once the trademark of special operations units, these devices are widely advertised to ''turn night into day''. In truth, they cannot accomplish this formidable task, but they do offer impressive enhancement of vision in limited light scenarios through electronically generated <b>images.</b> <b>Image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> {{and infrared}} imagers are both electronic devices for enhancing vision in the dark. However, each is based upon a totally different physical phenomenon. <b>Image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> amplify the available light energy whereas infrared imagers detect the thermal energy radiated from all objects. Because of this, each device operates from energy which is present in a different portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. This leads to differences in the ability of each device to detect and/or identify objects. This report is a compilation of the available information on both state-of-the-art <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> and infrared imagers. <b>Image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> developed in the United States, as well as some foreign made <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers,</b> are discussed. <b>Image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> are categorized according to their spectral response and sensitivity using the nomenclature of GEN I, GEN II, and GEN III. As the first generation of <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers,</b> GEN I, were large and of limited performance, this report will deal with only GEN II and GEN III equipment. Infrared imagers are generally categorized according to their spectral response, sensor materials, and related sensor operating temperature using the nomenclature Medium Wavelength Infrared (MWIR) Cooled and Long Wavelength Infrared (LWIR) Uncooled. MWIR Cooled refers to infrared imagers which operate in the 3 to 5 {micro}m wavelength electromagnetic spectral region and require either mechanical or thermoelectric coolers to keep the sensors operating at 77 K. LWIR Uncooled refers to infrared imagers which operate in the 8 to 12 {micro}m wavelength electromagnetic spectral region and do not require cooling below room temperature. Both commercial and military infrared sensors of these two types are discussed...|$|R

25|$|An <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> or <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tube is {{a vacuum}} tube device for {{increasing}} the intensity of available light in an optical system to allow use under low-light conditions, such as at night, to facilitate visual imaging of low-light processes, such as fluorescence of materials in X-rays or gamma rays (X-ray <b>image</b> <b>intensifier),</b> or for conversion of non-visible light sources, such as near-infrared or short wave infrared to visible. They operate by converting photons of light into electrons, amplifying the electrons (usually with a microchannel plate), and then converting the amplified electrons back into photons for viewing. They are used in devices such as night vision goggles.|$|R

The X-ray projection is modelled as a linear central projection. The <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> is modelled using a new explicit model that considers the curved input screen and the non-linear projection caused by electromagnetic fields. The CCD camera is modelled according to a general 2 D projective transformation of the output screen of the <b>image</b> <b>intensifier.</b> Thus, the back-projection, required for 3 D reconstruction, can be expressed in a closed-form. The model is compared to seven other known models. The presented model achieves high accuracy...|$|R

5000|$|The AN/PVS-7 is {{a single}} tube night vision device. Third {{generation}} <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> are standard for military night vision. The PVS-7 is auto-gated to prevent <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> damage if exposed to intense light. The goggles have active night vision using a built-in infrared LED for low light situations. They are waterproof and charged with nitrogen to prevent internal condensation while moving between extreme temperatures.|$|R
2500|$|Electronic Gating (or 'gating') is a {{means by}} which an <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tube may be {{switched}} ON and OFF in a controlled manner. An electronically gated <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tube functions like a camera shutter, allowing images to pass through when the electronic [...] "gate" [...] is enabled. The gating durations can be very short (nanoseconds or even picoseconds). [...] This makes gated <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tubes ideal candidates for use in research environments where very short duration events must be photographed. As an example, in order to assist engineers in designing more efficient combustion chambers, gated imaging tubes have been used to record very fast events such as the wavefront of burning fuel in an internal combustion engine.|$|R

25|$|Auto-gating is {{a feature}} {{found in many}} <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tubes {{manufactured}} for military purposes after 2006, though it {{has been around for}} some time. Autogated tubes gate the <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> within so as to control the amount of light that gets through to the microchannel plate. The gating occurs at high frequency and by varying the duty cycle to maintain a constant current draw from the microchannel plate, it is possible to operate the tube during brighter conditions, such as daylight, without damaging the tube or leading to premature failure. Auto-gating of <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> is militarily valuable as it allowed extended operational hours giving enhanced vision during twilight hours while providing better support for soldiers who encounter rapidly changing lighting conditions, such as those assaulting a building.|$|R
