5|$|A {{subsequent}} poll by The Straits Times {{found that}} while many Singaporeans <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> anthem generally meant, only seven out of 35 persons interviewed knew the meaning of each word. However, all but three of those interviewed agreed that the anthem {{should continue to be}} sung in Malay. The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English because that was the language most commonly used in Singapore. All the interviewees, including those who did not know the meaning of the lyrics, said they felt a sense of pride when they heard or sang the national anthem.|$|E
5|$|The script {{called for}} the {{creation}} of the Enterprise-C. In the first season, illustrator Andrew Probert– who had designed the Enterprise-D– was interested in a display of the design lineage of the ship from James T. Kirk's Enterprise to The Next Generations much larger ship, which was realized as a wall relief in the conference lounge behind the command bridge. Like most others, Probert assumed that the Enterprise-B was an Excelsior-class vessel and reasoned that the C would share design elements with its Excelsior-class predecessor and its Galaxy-class successor, Picard's ship. During this lineage project, Probert also produced a small color sketch of his version of Enterprise-C, but he left {{at the end of the}} season and his absence meant that no one <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> drawing was intended to be.|$|E

25|$|In January 2002, Kevin Collins and John Cullen {{undertook}} {{a search for}} more plants, locating a clump of six plants about 20kilometres (12mi) from the original two, and a further 18 plants on crown land adjacent to Kirkalocka. No flowering specimen was seen during these visits; indeed, no-one <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> flower looked like until 2006. In March of that year, storms associated with Cyclone Glenda dumped a year's worth of rain {{in the area in}} a single day, and shortly afterwards, flowers began to form. Two months later, a party of botanists and Banksia enthusiasts visited the area, and observed the flowers for the first time.|$|E

On the other hand, though, the weather conditions were harsher than they had been up at No. 2 Section, and the Ottoman troops were more active in their attempts at sabotage and air raids were common.|$|E

25|$|Schwartz and Ballard were {{introduced}} to Keith Prater at the University of Texas chemistry department, and sold him {{on the idea of}} developing a new rechargeable lithium battery technology with them. Prater was able to quickly determine that no one <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> product of the lithium-salt reactions in existing batteries were, and guessed that it was lithium dithionite, which he was able to synthesize. Working in a trailer, Ballard and Schwartz built a simple battery and Prater brought a sample of the lithium dithionite, and when they were placed together and charged, a weak current was produced. After further development the system was able to be recharged about a dozen times.|$|E
25|$|De Valera {{balked at}} the agreement. His opponents claimed that he had refused to join the {{negotiations}} because he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> outcome would be and {{did not wish to}} receive the blame. De Valera claimed that he had not gone to the treaty negotiations because he would be better able to control the extremists at home, and that his absence would allow leverage for the plenipotentiaries to refer back to him and not be pressured into any agreements. Because of the secret instructions given to the plenipotentiaries, he reacted to news of the signing of the Treaty not with anger at its contents (which he refused even to read when offered a newspaper report of its contents), but with anger over {{the fact that they had}} not consulted with him, their president, before signing. His ideal drafts, presented to a secret session of the Dáil during the Treaty Debates and publicised in January 1922, were ingenious compromises but they included dominion status, the Treaty Ports, the fact of partition subject to veto by the parliament in Belfast, and some continuing status for the King as head of the Commonwealth. Ireland's share of the imperial debt was to be paid.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the first}} film was commended for leaving the shark to the {{imagination}} until {{two thirds of the}} way through, Szwarc felt that they should show it as much as possible because the dramatic [...] "first image of it coming out of the water" [...] in {{the first film}} could never be repeated. Szwarc believed that the reduction of the first film's Hitchcockian suspense was inevitable because the audience already <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> shark looked like from the first film. Reviewers have since commented {{that there was no way}} that they were ever going to duplicate the original's effectiveness. The filmmakers gave the new shark a more menacing look by scarring it in the early boat explosion.|$|E

500|$|Although Vaughan {{has written}} for television, and has {{endeavored}} to have his previous works adapted into film, he stresses that he developed Saga strictly to be a comic book {{and not to be}} adapted to other media, explaining [...] "I wanted to do something that was way too expensive to be TV and too dirty and grown-up to be a four-quadrant blockbuster." [...] Vaughan has also indicated that he has an ending in mind for the series and that he plans five issues ahead, having written the first six issues as the first story arc, which would have ended with the two main characters dying on the rocketship launch pad in issue 5 if the series had not been successful. By June 2016, Vaughan indicated that he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> last page of the series' final issue would be.|$|E
500|$|While officially {{the matter}} was {{considered}} closed, many individual MPs had doubts, although none openly expressed disbelief at this stage. Wigg later said that he left the House that morning [...] "with black rage in my heart because I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> facts were. I knew the truth." [...] Most newspapers were editorially non-committal; only The Guardian, under the headline [...] "Mr Profumo clears the air", stated openly that the statement should be taken at its face value. Within a few days press attention was distracted by the re-emergence of Keeler, in Madrid. She expressed astonishment at the fuss her absence had caused, adding that her friendship with Profumo and his wife was entirely innocent {{and that she had}} many friends in important positions. She claimed that she had not deliberately missed the Edgecombe trial but had been confused about the date. She was required to forfeit her recognizance of £40, but no other action was taken against her.|$|E
500|$|Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore: Goldfinger's {{personal}} {{pilot and}} leader of an all-female team of pilots known as Pussy Galore's Flying Circus. Blackman was selected {{for the role of}} Pussy Galore because of her role in The Avengers and the script was rewritten to show Blackman's judo abilities. The character's name follows in the tradition of other Bond girls names that are double entendres. Concerned about censors, the producers thought about changing the character's name to [...] "Kitty Galore", but they and Hamilton decided [...] "if you were a ten-year old boy and <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> name meant, you weren't a ten-year old boy, you were a dirty little bitch. The American censor was concerned, but we got round that by inviting him and his wife out to dinner and [...] we were big supporters of the Republican Party." [...] During promotion, Blackman took delight in embarrassing interviewers by repeatedly mentioning the character's name. Whilst the American censors did not interfere with the name in the film, they refused to allow the name [...] "Pussy Galore" [...] to appear on promotional materials and for the US market she was subsequently called [...] "Miss Galore" [...] or [...] "Goldfinger's personal pilot".|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé {{said that}} she filmed B'Day Anthology Video Album because she [...] "always {{wanted to do a}} video album" [...] so that her fans wouldn't have to log onto YouTube to watch her music videos, but could instead play them via DVD. Beyoncé <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> videos' choreography would be before the filming began. She also planned her hairstyles, outfits and make-up. Beyoncé wanted each video to look different, and {{therefore}} she used different film techniques, fashion and styling. B'Day Anthology Video Album contains thirteen music videos and behind the scenes footage. The videos for [...] "Déjà Vu", [...] "Ring the Alarm", [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and [...] "Listen" [...] had been shot prior to the album's filming. The other nine videos were filmed in a two-week period. B'Day Anthology Video Album contains music videos for all of the songs from the standard edition of B'Day except for [...] "Resentment". It also includes videos for [...] "Beautiful Liar", [...] "Flaws and All" [...] and [...] "Still in Love (Kissing You)", which were featured only on the deluxe edition. According to Vibe, the thirteen videos on B'Day Anthology Video Album gave Beyoncé the record of the most music videos released in a twelve-month period.|$|E
500|$|Adams {{began her}} {{professional}} {{career as a}} dancer in a 1994 dinner theater production of A Chorus Line in Boulder, Colorado. The gig required her to wait on tables before getting up on stage to perform. Although she enjoyed singing and dancing, she disliked waitressing and ran into trouble when a fellow dancer, whom she considered a friend, made false accusations about her to the director. Adams said, [...] "I never really <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> lies were. I only knew I kept getting called in and lectured about my lack of professionalism." [...] She lost the job but went on to perform in dinner theater at Denver's Heritage Square Music Hall and Country Dinner Playhouse. During a performance of Anything Goes at the Country Dinner Playhouse in 1995, she was spotted by Michael Brindisi, the president and {{artistic director of the}} Minneapolis-based Chanhassen Dinner Theater, who offered her a job there. Adams relocated to Chanhassen, Minnesota, where she performed in the theater for the next three years. She loved the [...] "security and schedule" [...] of the job, and has said that she learned tremendously from it. Nonetheless, the grueling work took its toll on her: [...] "I had a lot of recurring injuriesbursitis in my knees, pulled muscles in my groin, my adductor and abductor. My body was wearing out." ...|$|E
500|$|Burton {{insisted that}} the film be bloody, as he felt stage {{versions}} of the play which {{cut back on the}} bloodshed robbed it of its power. For him, [...] "Everything is so internal with Sweeney that [...] is like his emotional release. It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing." [...] Producer Richard D. Zanuck said that [...] " [...] had a very clear plan that he wanted to lift that up into a surreal, almost Kill Bill kind of stylization. We had done tests and experiments with the neck slashing, with the blood popping out. I remember saying to Tim, 'My God, do we dare do this?'" [...] On set, the fake blood was colored orange to render correctly on the desaturated color film used, and crew members wore bin liners to avoid getting stained while filming. This macabre tone made some studios nervous, and it was not until Warner Bros., DreamWorks and Paramount had signed up for the project that the film's $50 million budget was covered. Burton said [...] "the studio was cool about it and they accepted it because they <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> show was. Any movie is a risk, but it is {{nice to be able to}} do something like that that doesn't fit into the musical or slasher movie categories." ...|$|E
