5|$|Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, first {{published}} in 1781 and presented again with major revisions in 1787, represents a significant intervention into what will later {{become known as the}} philosophy of mind. Kant's first critique is generally recognized as among the most significant works of modern philosophy in the West. Kant is a figure whose influence is marked in both continental and analytic/Anglo-American philosophy. Kant's work develops an <b>in-depth</b> <b>study</b> of transcendental consciousness, or {{the life of the mind}} as conceived through universal categories of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|All {{editions of}} the book were being printed in Europe until 1941, when the first {{publication}} of {{it was done in}} the United States by I. Bernard Cohen. The book is Franklin's only scientific work, and is recognized by historians Gary F. Kurutz and Dennis Smith as America's most important scientific book of the eighteenth century. The publication for his scientific observations on electricity made Franklin famous throughout Europe as a serious scientist. Eighteenth-century British polymath Joseph Priestley writes in his book The History and Present State of Electricity (1767) that nobody had written an <b>in-depth</b> <b>study</b> of electricity with the use of scientific experimentation like this of Franklin's that had been translated into most European languages in the eighteenth century.|$|E
40|$|<b>In-depth</b> <b>studies</b> in English is {{a subject}} in lower {{secondary}} school which {{has been reported to}} struggle with low status. The subject has also struggled {{due to the fact that}} very many of the students have low proficiency in English, an aspect which collides with the ambition level in the national curriculum (LK 06). To learn more about <b>in-depth</b> <b>studies</b> in English I wanted to research how English teachers reported teaching this subject, and how these ways of teaching cohered with the intentions for the subject set by The Ministry of Education and Research. I also wanted to learn how LK 06 came into play when teachers planned their lessons, and what challenges teachers reported facing when teaching <b>in-depth</b> <b>studies</b> in English. Conducting qualitative interviews stood out as the most suitable method for answering these research questions, and I therefore interviewed five teachers of <b>in-depth</b> <b>studies</b> in English. All five teachers worked in different schools, and the data was therefore based on five different perspectives on how <b>in-depth</b> <b>studies</b> in English is being taught. The analysis of the data was based on grounded theory. The most central finding from the research was how school administrations in many schools often consistently prioritized other subjects before <b>in-depth</b> <b>studies</b> in English, and how this made teachers down-prioritize <b>in-depth</b> <b>studies,</b> as well. The school’s policy regarding students’ possibilities to change from foreign languages to <b>in-depth</b> <b>studies</b> in English during the year, as well as the size of the classes, was central for the status of the subject. These aspects also seem to affect the students’ motivation toward <b>in-depth</b> <b>studies.</b> Teachers of <b>in-depth</b> <b>studies</b> in English reported to be working much as intended by The Ministry of Education and Research (as described in the report Motivasjon – Mestring – Muligheter). The challenge, however, was the paradox of how the ambition level of the competence aims in LK 06 collided with the possibilities of the students of <b>in-depth</b> <b>studies</b> in English to experience mastery of the English language. The teachers therefore reported using the aims in LK 06 only in little degree, consequently making <b>in-depth</b> <b>studies</b> in English a subject which varied from school to school. I suggest that to overcome this challenge, LK 06 needs to be revised. The intentions for the subject, as set by The Ministry of Education and Research through LK 06, need to fit the group of students who choose <b>in-depth</b> <b>studies</b> in English better than they do today...|$|R

5|$|Because of {{its great}} depth, {{for a long}} time Davidson Seamount had been preceded only by a sparse few investigations. Davidson is {{interesting}} to volcanologists because of its unique geology, and to biologists for its unique ecology. In 2002 the NOAA sponsored the first modern <b>in-depth</b> <b>study</b> of the seamount. The team included scientists, educators, and resource managers, with the goal of documenting species, taking geologic samples, and describing the ocean environment. The expedition documented many rare, previously undiscovered species that exist nowhere else, not even on nearby seamounts, including ancient coral gardens that are vulnerable to human activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} excavations of {{the site}} were carried out in 1927–1928 by archaeologists from the National Archaeological Museum in Sofia and the Bulgarian Antiquities Society {{under the direction of}} Yordan Gospodinov. A second effort headed by Krastyu Miyatev resulted in a much more <b>in-depth</b> <b>study,</b> and archaeological research at the site is ongoing. In 1927, the Round Church, along with the entirety of medieval Preslav, was proclaimed a historical and archaeological reserve and placed under state protection as a national antiquity. In 1970, it was individually included in the list of monuments of culture of national importance with a publication in that year's State Gazette, issue 46. As part of the Veliki Preslav architectural reserve, the Round Church is listed as No. 98 among the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|With Peter Schneider, Ehlers {{embarked}} on an <b>in-depth</b> <b>study</b> of the foundations of gravitational lensing. One result of this work was a 1992 monograph co-authored with Schneider and Emilio Falco. It was the first systematic exposition of the topic that included both the theoretical foundations and the observational results. From the viewpoint of astronomy, gravitational lensing is often described using a quasi-Newtonian approximation—assuming the gravitational field to be small and the deflection angles to be minute—which is perfectly sufficient for most situations of astrophysical relevance. In contrast, the monograph developed a thorough and complete description of gravitational lensing from a fully relativistic space-time perspective. This feature of the book played a major part in its long-term positive reception. In the following years, Ehlers continued his research on the propagation of bundles of light in arbitrary spacetimes.|$|E

Recent <b>in-depth</b> <b>studies</b> of satellite imagery and environmental analysis regarding forest classification conclude an accurate estimate of approximately 30% tree cover, a stark decrease in the 60% forest cover in 1925. Despite recent <b>in-depth</b> <b>studies,</b> the notoriously unsubstantiated 2% forest cover estimate has been widely circulated in media and in discourse concerning the country. Despite the drastic underestimation of Haiti's forest cover, {{the country has been}} significantly deforested over the last 50 years, resulting in the desertification of portions of the Haitian territory.|$|R

25|$|The Guardian {{columnist}} and foreign correspondent Jonathan Steele {{published an article}} based on this line of reasoning. In an <b>in-depth</b> <b>study</b> of Iranian attitudes to Jews {{and the state of}} Israel, Hamburg professor of Islamic studies, Katajun Amirpur has argued that, in context, Ahmadinejad had been quoting Ayatollah Khomeini's words about the imminent appearance of the Soviet Union and the Shah's regime, and had tacked on his remarks concerning Israel. It follows, in her view, that the text could not imply any intention to destroy Israel or annihilate the Jewish people, since Khomeini's quoted statement preceding it prophesied that the Soviet Union and the Shah's regime would disappear, not that the Russian or Iranian people would thereby be extinguished.|$|E
