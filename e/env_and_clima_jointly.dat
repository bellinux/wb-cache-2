40|$|Three {{size classes}} of human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) mRNAs are produced in infected cells: full-length, intermediate, and small. Here we report that the intermediate-size class of viral mRNAs is heterogeneous, consisting of at least 12 differentially spliced species. This group contains nine bicistronic mRNAs producing <b>Env</b> <b>and</b> Vpu and three mRNAs expressing only the first exon of tat. In the latter mRNAs, <b>Env</b> <b>and</b> Vpu expression is blocked {{by the presence of}} the upstream tat open reading frame. We conclude that internal initiation of translation is not the mechanism for generation of the bicistronic env mRNAs. Translation of HIV- 1 mRNAs is consistent with the scanning mechanism in which Env is produced by leaky scanning from mRNAs that contain env as the second or third reading frame. <b>Env</b> <b>and</b> Vpu proteins are expressed from the same mRNAs and are coordinately regulated by Rev.

40|$|SummaryHIV- 1 {{assembly}} {{depends on}} its structural protein, Gag, which after synthesis on ribosomes, traffics to the late endosome/plasma membrane, associates with HIV <b>Env</b> glycoprotein, <b>and</b> forms infectious virions. While <b>Env</b> <b>and</b> Gag migrate to lipid microdomains, their stoichiometry and specificity of interaction are unknown. Pseudotyped viral particles {{can be made with}} one viral core surrounded by heterologous envelope proteins. Taking advantage of this property, we analyzed the association of HIV <b>Env</b> <b>and</b> Ebola glycoprotein (GP), with HIV- 1 Gag coexpressed in the same cell. Though both viral glycoproteins were expressed, each associated independently with Gag, giving rise to distinct virion populations, each with a single glycoprotein type. Confocal imaging demonstrated that <b>Env</b> <b>and</b> GP localized to distinct lipid raft microdomains within the same cell where they associated with different virions. Thus, a single Gag particle associates “quantally” with one lipid raft, containing homogeneous trimeric viral envelope proteins, to assemble functional virions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{etiology}} of the neurogenerative disease multiple sclerosis (MS) is unknown. The leading hypotheses suggest that MS {{is the result}} of exposure of genetically susceptible individuals to certain environmental factor(s). Herpesviruses and human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) represent potentially important factors in MS development. Herpesviruses can activate HERVs, and HERVs are activated in MS patients. Results Using flow cytometry, we have analyzed HERV-H <b>Env</b> <b>and</b> HERV-W <b>Env</b> epitope expression on the surface of PBMCs from MS patients with active and stable disease, and from control individuals. We have also analyzed serum antibody levels to the expressed HERV-H <b>and</b> HERV-W <b>Env</b> epitopes. We found a significantly higher expression of HERV-H <b>and</b> HERV-W <b>Env</b> epitopes on B cells and monocytes from patients with active MS compared with patients with stable MS or control individuals. Furthermore, patients with active disease had relatively higher numbers of B cells in the PBMC population, and higher antibody reactivities towards HERV-H <b>Env</b> <b>and</b> HERV-W <b>Env</b> epitopes. The higher antibody reactivities in sera from patients with active MS correlate with the higher levels of HERV-H <b>Env</b> <b>and</b> HERV-W <b>Env</b> expression on B cells and monocytes. We did not find such correlations for stable MS patients or for controls. Conclusion These findings indicate that both HERV-H <b>Env</b> <b>and</b> HERV-W <b>Env</b> are expressed in higher quantities on the surface of B cells and monocytes in patients with active MS, and that the expression of these proteins may be associated with exacerbation of the disease. </p...|$|R

The optimal {{transcription}} position for both <b>Env</b> <b>and</b> Gag genes in the NDV genome was determined by generating recombinant NDV (rNDV) -Env-Gag (gp 160 located between the P andM genes and Gag between the HN and L genes), rNDV-Gag-Env (Gag located between the P andM genes and gp 160 between the HN and L genes), rNDV-Env/Gag (gp 160 followed by Gag located between the P andM genes), and rNDV-Gag/Env (Gag fol-lowed by gp 160 located between the P andM genes). All the recombinant viruses replicated at levels similar to those seen with parental NDV in embryonated chicken eggs and in chicken fibroblast cells. Both gp 160 and Gag proteins were expressed at high levels in cell culture, with gp 160 found to {{be incorporated into the}} envelope of NDV. The Gag <b>and</b> <b>Env</b> proteins expressed by all the recombinants except rNDV-Env-Gag self-assembled into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) virus-like particles (VLPs).

Identification of the cellular cofactors involved in the production of infectious HIV- 1 from macrophages is thus crucial.

Using siRNA approach, we show that TIP 47 is essential for HIV- 1 infectivity and propagation. TIP 47 silencing disrupts Gag <b>and</b> <b>Env</b> colocalization in macrophages. Moreover, mutations in HIV- 1 Gag or Env, which abolish interaction with TIP 47, impair HIV- 1 propagation and infectivity preventing colocalization of Gag <b>and</b> <b>Env,</b> Gag <b>and</b> <b>Env</b> coimmunoprecipitation. Interestingly, disruption of Gag-TIP 47 interaction by matrix mutation or TIP 47 depletion also causes Gag to localize in scattered dots in the vicinity of the plasma membrane of macrophages.

We therefore sequenced provi-ral DNA isolated from peripheral bloodmononuclear cells fromHIV-infected individuals on fully suppressive antiretroviral therapy. We performed phylogenetic analyses, calculated viral diversity and divergence in the <b>env</b> <b>and</b> pol genes, and determined coreceptor tropism and the frequency of drug resistance mutations. Comprehensive immune profiling included quantification of immune cell subsets, plasma cytokine levels, and intracellular signaling responses in T cells, B cells, andmonocytes.

A clinical history of virologic failure was also not significantly associ-ated with levels of immune activation, indicating that a history of virologic failure does not inexorably lead to increased immune activation as long as suppressive antiretroviral medications are provided.

Methods: <b>env</b> <b>and</b> pol sequences and city locations from DRC, RC and Angola were retrieved from published articles and Los Alamos HIV database. We created three random datasets for <b>env</b> <b>and</b> two for pol based on time span, geography and viral diversity.

A non‐reversible phylogeographic model implemented in BEAST was used to infer a time‐calibrated phylogenetic history. The Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection and robust counting analyses were performed to estimate the most significant pathways of viral dispersal.

Three other macaques were primed with recombinant DNA vectors expressing Gag, <b>Env,</b> <b>and</b> a Pol-Tat-Nef-Vif fusion protein prior to boosting with the HSV vectors. Robust anti-Gag and anti-Env cellular responses were detected in all six macaques. Following intravenous challenge with wild-type, cloned SIV 239, peak and 12 -week plasma viremia levels were significantly lower in vaccinated compared to control macaques. Plasma SIV RNA in vaccinated macaques was inversely correlated with anti-Rev ELISPOT responses {{on the day of}} challenge (P value< 0. 05), anti-Tat ELISPOT responses at 2  weeks post challenge (P value < 0. 05) and peak neutralizing antibody titers pre-challenge (P value 0. 06). These findings support continued study of recombinant herpesviruses as a vaccine approach for AIDS...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the pharmacokinetics <b>and</b> <b>clima</b> response of high-dose etoposide {{in combination with}} carboplatin for pediatric cancer patients undergo-ing autologous bone marrow transplant. Patients and Methods: Pharmacokinetic parameters for etoposide were determined at doses of 960, 1, 200, and 1, 500 mg/m 2 when given with high-dose car-boplatin and followed by autologous marrow rescue. Twenty-nine patients (age 1. 6 to 23 years) with refrac-tory or relapsed solid tumors were studied. Etoposide was administered in three divided doses as a 6 -hour in-fusion on alternate days with carboplatin. Etoposide con-centrations (n = 14) were determined during and follow-ing each of three doses. Patient characteristics, drug dose, and pharmacokinetic parameters were examine...|$|R
40|$|HTLV- 1 is endemic in Brazil and HIV/ HTLV- 1 {{coinfection}} {{has been}} detected, {{mostly in the}} northeast region. Cosmopolitan HTLV- 1 a is the main subtype that circulates in Brazil. This study characterized 17 HTLV- 1 isolates from HIV coinfected patients of southern (n = 7) and southeastern (n = 10) Brazil. HTLV- 1 provirus DNA was amplified by nested PCR (<b>env</b> <b>and</b> LTR) <b>and</b> sequenced. <b>Env</b> sequences (705 bp) from 15 isolates and LTR sequences (731 bp) from 17 isolates showed 99. 5 % and 98. 8 % similarity among sequences, respectively. Comparing these sequences with ATK (HTLV- 1 a) and Mel 5 (HTLV- 1 c) prototypes, similarities of 99 % and 97. 4 %, respectively, for <b>env</b> <b>and</b> LTR with ATK, and 91. 6 % and 90. 3 % with Mel 5, were detected. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all sequences belonged to the transcontinental subgroup A of the Cosmopolitan subtype, clustering in two Latin American clusters.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the primary cellular immune responses to {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) <b>Env</b> <b>and</b> Gag proteins elicited by recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSVs). The primary response to Env peaked 5 to 7 days after intraperitoneal vaccination, at which time 40 % of CD 8 + cells were <b>Env</b> tetramer positive <b>and</b> activated (CD 62 LLo). These freshly isolated cells actively lysed target cells pulsed with the p 18 -I 10 peptide and secreted gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha after stimulation with the Env p 18 -I 10 peptide. The primary response to Env elicited by rVSVs was sixfold higher than that elicited by recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVVs) at 5 days postvaccination. An intranasal route of vaccination with VSV-Env also elicited a strong primary response to Env. The primary immune response to Gag elicited by rVSV peaked 7 days after vaccination, at which time 3 % of CD 8 + cells were Gag tetramer positive and CD 62 LLo and functional by intracellular cytokine staining. This response was eightfold higher than that elicited by rVV expressing Gag. VSV-GagEnv, which expresses both Gag <b>and</b> <b>Env</b> from a single recombinant, also induced strong cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses to both <b>Env</b> <b>and</b> Gag. Our quantitative analyses illustrate the potency of the VSV vector system in CTL induction...|$|R
