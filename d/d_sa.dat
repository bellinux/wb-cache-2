The 3 D topography of the milled surface was studied as well. The results indicate that 3 D parameters (Sa and Sq) are more capable to describe the influence of the milling parameters on the surface quality, and among them Sq is preferable due to its good sensitivity.

This study evaluates potential benefits of using distortion-free images in arthroscopic surgery. METHODS: Distortion-free images were obtained using RDFixer™ software (Perceive 3 <b>D,</b> <b>SA)</b> to remove RD in the input video stream. Twelve orthopedic residents performed an arthroscopic task (loose body removal) in a dry-knee model using video with and without distortion.

RESULTS: A statistically significant improvement of all parameters was observed with distortion-free images. Residents perceived distortion-free images as providing a wider field-of-view and a better notion of relative depth and distance.

Several forms for the behavior of such a moment {{have appeared in the}} theoretical literature, some of which have been invoked to explain experimental results found in various multiferroic materials. The forms specifically are P 1 ~ R x (Sa x Sb); P 2 ~ Sa x Sb, and P 3 ~ Sa (R. Sa) - Sb (R. Sb), where R is the relative position of the atoms and Sa, Sb are unit vectors. To unify and generalize these various forms we consider P as the most general quadratic function of the spin components that vanishes whenever Sa and Sb are collinear, i. e. we consider the most general expressions that require spin canting. The study reveals new forms. We generalize to the vector P, Moriya's symmetry considerations regarding the (scalar) Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya energy <b>D.</b> <b>Sa</b> x Sb (which led to restrictions on D). This provides a rigorous symmetry argument which shows that P 1 is allowed no matter how high the symmetry of the atoms plus environment, and gives restrictions for all other contributions. The analysis leads to the suggestion of terms omitted in the existing microscopic models, suggests a new mechanism behind the ferroelectricity found in the 'proper screw structure' of CuXO 2, X=Fe, Cr, and predicts an unusual antiferroelectric ordering in the antiferromagnetically and ferroelectrically ordered phase of RbFe(MoO 4) 2.

Thirty-four sources in a complete sample were detected above 7. 5 microJy and 25 are optically identified to a limit of I= 25. 8, using our deep HST and ground-based images. The radio sources are usually located within 0. 5 " (typically 5 kpc) of a galaxy nucleus, and generally have a diameter less than 2. 5 ". The second field at 17 h, + 50 d (Hercules Field) has an rms noise of 35 microJy and contains 10 sources. We have also analyzed a complete flux density-limited sample at 8. 4 GHz of 89 sources from five deep radio surveys, including the Hubble deep field. Half of all the optical counterparts are with galaxies brighter than I= 23 mag, but 20 % are fainter than I= 25. 5 mag.

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} of floodplains is {{closely linked to}} the sustainable flood mitigation measures. Various sustainability assessment (SA) methods to evaluate the influence of policies, plans or projects towards sustainable development have been emerging in recent years; however, most of them are national or regional policies and programs. Very few research studies have been carried out for sustainability assessment of flood mitigation projects. This paper presents the concept of a proposed sustainability assessment framework for flood mitigation projects and its application to a recently implemented flood levee project in Australia. This research has employed a review of the life cycle of flood mitigation projects, sustainability assessment (SA) methodologies, consultations with experts, and a case study of flood mitigation projects. In line with the project life cycle, the proposed sustainability assessment framework is developed incorporating five stages: a) contextualizing the project, b) SA during planning and implementation, c) SA during flood event, <b>d)</b> <b>SA</b> at periodic intervals, and e) SA at modification phase or changing to a new project. The application of the SA framework to the first two stages of a flood levee project demonstrates how the best suitable alternative levee option can be chosen in the planning stage by determining a sustainability index (SI) of the possible alternatives using a set of sustainability indicators. The study also shows achievement towards sustainability of the finally implemented project can be compared with the originally planned project using the SA framework. The application of the SA framework suggests the potential for better decision making for individual flood mitigation projects, taking into account the sustainable outcome of the project as well as linking this to regional sustainable developmentGriffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringNo Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} murine {{recombinant}} tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) and natural TNF in tumor-necrotizing serum (TNS) to cause regression of the SA 1 sarcoma was investigated. We found that to cause regression of a 9 - <b>d</b> <b>SA</b> 1 sarcoma, near lethal quantities of rTNF and TNS {{had to be}} given to the host. However, even at these highly toxic doses, rTNF was not reliable at causing complete tumor regression. On the other hand, both types of TNF were reliable at causing a tumor hemorrhagic reaction that resulted in the destruction of greater than 75 % of the tumor's center in 24 h. The TNF-induced hemorrhagic reaction involved the development of numerous petechial hemorrhages in the tumor's vascular bed, which apparently resulted from destruction of the tumor's blood vessels. It was possible to follow the development of the hemorrhagic reaction against time after giving rTNF or TNS by measuring the intratumor extravasation of 51 Cr-labeled syngeneic red cells. According to this method, TNF-induced intratumor hemorrhaging was in progress within 1 h of giving TNF and continued for about a 6 -h period. However, the hemorrhagic reaction was greatly reduced and complete regression of the rim of the living tumor tissue that survived hemorrhagic necrosis failed to occur, if SA 1 sarcoma was growing in T cell-deficient (TXB) mice. This indicates that the TNF-induced hemorrhagic reaction is partly dependent, and the tumor regression that follows is completely dependent on host immunocompetence. This suggests in turn, that rTNF does not directly destroy SA 1 tumor cells in vivo, even though it was shown that it can destroy SA 1 tumor cells in vitro. This interpretation is supported by the additional findings that rTNF was no more therapeutic against a 3 -d (3 -mm) SA 1 than against a 9 -d (8 -mm) SA 1, and was no more therapeutic when injected directly into the tumor than when injected intravenously. Lastly it was possible to completely inhibit the ability of rTNF and TNS to cause tumor hemorrhagic necrosis and regression by infusing the host with a monospecific, polyvalent anti- rTNF antibody that neutralized the cytotoxic action of rTNF in vitro...|$|E

To view a copy of this license, visit [URL] elevate extracellular dopamine, but the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. Here we show in rodents that acute pharmacological inhibition of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) blocks amphetamine-induced locomotion and self-administration without impacting cocaine-induced behaviours. To study VMAT's role in mediating amphetamine action in dopamine neurons, we have used novel genetic, pharmacological and optical approaches in Drosophila melanogaster. In an ex vivo whole-brain preparation, fluorescent reporters of vesicular cargo and of vesicular pH reveal that amphetamine redistributes vesicle contents and diminishes the vesicle pH-gradient responsible for dopamine uptake and retention. This amphetamine-induced deacidification requires VMAT function and results from net H+ antiport by VMAT out of the vesicle lumen coupled to inward amphetamine transport. Amphetamine-induced vesicle deacidification also requires functional dopamine transporter (DAT) at the plasma membrane. Thus, we find that at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, amphetamines must be actively transported by DAT and VMAT in tandem to produce psychostimulant effects.

40|$|The {{growing demand}} for energy {{in the future will}} necessitate the {{production}} of natural gas from fields which are located farther offshore, in deep water and in very cold environments. This will confront us with difficulties in ensuring continuous production of the fluids (natural gas, condensate and water) emerging from a natural gas well. Often, all the three phases are transported together through a multiphase flow pipeline to processing facilities onshore. The natural gas production pipelines that carry the wellstream fluids from the subsea wells to the processing facilities are designed using engineering multiphase flow models. It is known that the currently available flow models cannot predict the most important flow parameters such as pressure drop and liquid holdup with sufficient accuracy when the gas production is low. At these conditions, the liquid accumulates in V-sections (lower elbows, low spots) of a pipeline, which are present because the pipeline profile follows the undulations in the seafloor topography. When the flow is low, the existing engineering models show large uncertainty in predicting the shear stresses, particularly at the gas-liquid interface. This uncertainty leads to the inaccurate prediction of, for example, the liquid holdup, which can cause production problems connected with liquid slugs, corrosion and the formation of gas hydrates. In this Thesis, the problem of liquid accumulation in an undulating pipeline is studied both at a more general, macroscopic level in a flowloop that contains a V-shaped section, as well as on a detailed, fundamental level in a straight horizontal pipe. Both configurations, however, have the same flow pattern: stratified gas-liquid flow. The main issues addressed in the V-section setup are the conditions of liquid accumulation and removal in the case of zero net liquid flow with gas flowing over a stagnant liquid pool, as well as the appearance of multiple steady-state solutions in the two-phase models at these conditions. The detailed measurements in the horizontal setup aimed at simultaneously capturing the velocities in both phases in the entire streamwise cross-section of the pipe and the position of the gas-liquid interface. This provided detailed information on waves and turbulence, which are the main phenomena in stratified flow. The occurrence of multiple solutions in stratified flow models was studied by applying a steady state and a transient model to various conditions for which lab experiments exist and by verifying the structural stability of the obtained solutions. It was found that the applied transient model (supplied with the criterion for structural stability) can qualitatively predict the measurements in zero net liquid flow, at conditions where hysteresis occurs and in experiments with a holdup discontinuity. Based on the comparison with available experimental data, it was concluded that hysteresis can only occur in fully laminar flow of both phases, and it is not expected to occur at typical field conditions. However, to achieve a better quantitative agreement with the measurements, the closure relations used in the model need to be improved. Measurements of the gas velocity, liquid holdup and pressure drop in zero net liquid flow were performed in a setup containing a V-shaped section. It was shown that the critical gas velocity (i. e. the minimum gas velocity at which the liquid is removed from the low spot) and pressure gradient increase with increasing inclination angle and with increasing liquid density and viscosity, while the liquid holdup stays approximately the same. The results were compared to the predictions of a mechanistic flow model, which was modified to account for the recirculation in the stagnant liquid layer at critical conditions by employing a theoretical solution for the wall shear stress at laminar flow conditions of the liquid. Good agreement was found between the measurements and the simulations. Stratified two-phase flow of air and water was measured with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in a horizontal transparent pipe, with a laminar, transitional or turbulent liquid, and a smooth or a wavy interface. An advanced experiment was designed and built, which uses two lasers and three cameras to simultaneously measure the liquid velocity, interface shape and gas velocity. The data were time- and phase-averaged to obtain detailed and accurate insight into the turbulent and wavy structures. The cases with a smooth interface were shown to approximately follow the velocity laws valid in single-phase flows. The wavy region of the flowmap (constructed with superficial gas and liquid velocities at the axes) had waves which are asymmetric, with gravitational and capillary forces of similar magnitude. The linear wave theory provided a good approximation of the wave-induced velocity profiles, although the wave non-linearity caused a deviation close to the interface. The separation of wavy and turbulent motion was, however, only partly successful due to the wide range of wavelengths and wave heights in all the wavy cases. The laminar-to-turbulent transition of the liquid phase in stratified gas-liquid flow was also studied. The boundaries of transition were determined in both the smooth and the wavy region of the flowmap. In both regions, the Reynolds number at the start {{and at the end of}} transition decreased with increasing gas flowrate. The two occurring wave patterns (labelled ` 2 D small amplitude' and ` 3 D small amplitude' waves) corresponded to the capillary-gravity and the gravity-capillary solutions of linear wave theory. This led us to recast the flowmap of the wavy region into Weber number - Froude number coordinates, which in turn provided a physical interpretation of the interaction between the developing turbulence and the changing wave patterns. Finally, the interfacial characteristics and the velocities were investigated in both phases of stratified flow in two wave patterns: ` 3 D small amplitude' and ` 2 D large amplitude' waves. The 2 D LA waves (corresponding to gravity waves) had higher and longer waves, that changed the liquid velocities in almost the entire liquid layer. The 3 <b>D</b> <b>SA</b> wave pattern (corresponding to gravity-capillary waves) had smaller and shorter waves whose influence was limited to only a part of the liquid height. The effect of the two wave regimes on gas phase velocities, however, was rather similar. In all cases, waves produced an increase in the Reynolds stresses in the air close to the interface, which was linked to the occurrence of boundary layer separation at the interface. The occurrence of separation correlated well with the wave properties. The results of the current study provide a step forward in understanding stratified gas-liquid flow through straight pipes. The physical explanations and insights of the measured phenomena can be used to develop new correlations for the engineering flow models, which is the type of models that are currently widely applied in the industry. Furthermore, a high-quality experimental database for an elementary two-phase pipe flow configuration has now been established. This database can be used for the improvement and validation of more advanced models for such two-phase flows. In particular, these are Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models of increasing complexity, such as Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS), Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) ...|$|E

Intellectual property rights are a complex, multifaceted area and one in which corporate strategies are poorly understood.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{two aspects}} of Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) in d dimensions. Its rst part is devoted to {{conformal}} blocks, special functions that arise in the partial wave expansion of CFT four-point functions. We prove that these conformal blocks admit an expansion in terms of polar coordinates and show that the expansion coecients are determined by recursion relations. Conformal blocks are naturally dened on the complex plane: we study their restriction to the real line, and show that they obey a fourth-order dierential equation there. This ODE {{can be used to}} eciently compute conformal blocks and their derivatives in general d. Several applications to the conformal bootstrap program are mentioned. The second half of this thesis investigates RG ows that are dened by perturbing a CFT by a number of relevant operators. We study such ows using the Truncated Conformal Space Approach (TCSA) of Yurov and Zamolodchikov, a numerical method that allows for controlled computations in strongly coupled QFTs. Two dierent RG ows are considered: the free scalar feld deformed by a mass term, and 4 theory. The former is used as a benchmark, in order to compare numerical TCSA results to exact predictions. TCSA results for 4 theory display spontaneous Z 2 symmetry breaking at strong coupling: we study the spectrum of this theory both in the Z 2 -broken and preserved phase, and we compare the critical exponents governing the phase transition to known values. In a separate chapter, we show how truncation errors can be reduced by adding suitable counterterms to the bare TCSA action, following earlier work in d = 2 dimensions.

40|$|In the {{discussion}} about forest management the maintenance of biodiversity is coming {{more and more to}} the fore. Like 120 other countries, Sweden committed itself to a sustainable use of for­ ests at the convention of Rio de Janeiro. Sweden has a long tradition of forest management fo­ cusing on woodproduction. This implies that almost all the forest land is managed and that the area of natural forests is very small. The maintenance of biodiversity should therefor not be limited to reserved areas but it should be incorporated into the management of the total forest area. There is a need for improved methods to balance the economic and ecological benefits of forest management. In this study I designed an algorithm for mathematical programming that includes the determination of a contiguous area of old forest into a long range forest manage­ ment plan that strives for the sustainable production of wood as well as the maintenance of biodiversity. The boreal forests of Sweden were characterised by two main disturbance patterns. In dry and mesic forests, fires determined the structure of the forest. This resulted in large scale pattern where Scots pine and broad-leaved trees dominated. In the wetter forests, dominated by Nor­ way spruce, small scale disturbances like windthrow brought about a heterogeneous forest structure with a long continuity. With the management of the forests for woodproduction, some characteristic features disappeared. The amount of old-growth forests, deciduous trees and coarse woody debris decreased significantly and large scale clearcuts resulted in a loss of re­ tained trees, characteristic for an area after forest fire. Especially these features are of impor­ tance for the maintenance of biodiversity. Rare and sensitive species are largely dependent on structures determined by natural disturbance patterns. The objective function in the long range forest management plan is a maximisation of the Net Present Value of the woodproduction. To ensure a sustainable supply of wood in the future this objective function is bounded by even flow and ending stock constraints. For the maintenance of biodiversity, constraints are implemented as well. These constraints stem from the assump­ tion that the biodiversity benefits by the establishment of certain features abundant in natural forests and scarce in managed forests. Special attention is paid to a certain contiguous area of old forest. This is a conversion of the current attention for spatial aspects in biodiversity. A contiguous area of old forest ensures a core area without any edge effects. Many red-listed species depend on this. In natural resource management, Linear Programming (LP) is most common among the mathematical programming techniques. It gives an optimal solution and is efficient. The model described above can largely be solved with LP. The constraint on the contiguous area of old forest will however cause problems. The way this constraint is formulated is known as a Quad­ ratic Assignment Problem (QAP). This kind of problem is hard to solve and LP is not suitable. Other exact solution methods like the Branch and Bound method can only solve very small problems. Heuristics are a good alternative. Although they do not guarantee an optimal solu­ tion, they are able to solve large problems in an acceptable amount of time. Simulated Anneal­ <b>ing</b> (<b>SA)</b> is a heuristic method that gives high quality solutions because it has the ability to overcome local optima and convergence to a high value. I have designed a sequential approach. Herein the strong points of both methods are united. First the QAP is solved using SA. After that, the rest of the problem is solved by LP. This part is bounded by the outcome of the SA. In the objective function for the SA, next to a measure for the contiguous area of forest, the Net Present Value is added. A weightfactor determines the relative importance of these two ele­ ments in relation to each other. With this the SA solution will fit as effective as possible into the final solution for the whole problem, that is at the least costs. The algorithm is tested on validity, reliability and efficiency. Validity relates to the question if the algorithm does what it is perceived to do. The test revealed some points that need extra attention. The determination of the parameters for the so called cooling down of the SA is some­ what troublesome and needs to be regarded from case to case. Focusing strongly on either the contiguous area or the NPV in the SA-objective function gives results that are poor in relation to the results of an objective function wherein the two are balanced. The inclusion of the NPV in the SA-objective function does make the SA-solution effective in terms of the final outcome. In general the performance of the algorithm is as expected. The algorithm turned out to be very reliable, that means that a repetition gives about the same value all the time. For a sample for­ est of sixteen stands with more than 900 possible management regimes the algorithm could produce a solution within a minute, indicating that it is efficient. In a case study the sequential approach algorithm is applied on the Brattaker area, near Umea in Northern Sweden. The Simulated Annealing created contiguous old forest areas. The results are some more or less contiguous areas of between 100 and 150 hectares. The outcome is lim­ ited by the actual situation in the area. Not all forest can be old in fifty years. Next to that the algorithm shows a preference for small stands, causing {{a large part of the}} area, a part consist­ ing of large stands, to be without old forest. The costs for contiguous old forest are relatively small compared to non contiguous old forest. The Simulated Annealing algorithm has the ca­ pability to form contiguous old forest in an efficient way. If the contiguous old forest is worth the additional costs, compared to non contiguous old forest, is a question for the decision mak­ ers. The Linear Programming produces a long range forest management plan. In this plan the features of importance for biodiversity are all established. With this it is assumed that biodi­ versity is maintained the coming fifty years. The sustainable provision of wood is guaranteed for this period. But this is at the expanse of the further future because the age structure is se­ verely distorted. The main reason for this seems to be the combination of interest rate, initial age structure and the requirement for old forest. The used interest rate caused a strong prefer­ ence for a present income to a future income. Because of that, and the initial age structure, the cut volume in the first period is extraordinary high, which has its effects on the age structure after 50 years. The requirement for old forest is in conflict with the age structure, which might cause problems for the provision of old forest after the planning horizon of 50 years. The main conclusion is that the algorithm can give good results. It shows some of the possibili­ ties to link a heuristic method with Linear Programming. An improvement could be the use of a shape index for the formation of contiguous old forest. It became clear that the situation and parameters in a case study have a major influence. The interest rate and an already unbalanced age structure limited the possibilities to test the algorithm. To generate data that is of use in the decision making process the algorithm needs more refinement. The site characteristics should be taken into account and a situation should be created that will ensure the sustainable provi­ sion of wood and biodiversity also after the planning horizon...|$|R

The regulatory capital is the capital that a bank has to hold as a security for credit risk and this capital should serve as a buffer if they would loose unexpected amounts of money in their lending business. Loss-Given-Default (LGD) {{is one of the main}} drivers of the regulatory capital and the minimum required capital is highly sensitive to the reported LGD. Workout LGD is based on the discounted future cash flows obtained from defaulted customers. The main issue with workout LGD is the incomplete workouts, which in turn results in two problems for banks when they calculate their workout LGD. A bank either has to wait for the workout period to end, in which some cases take several years, or to exclude or make rough assumptions about those incomplete workouts in their calculations. In this study the idea from Survival analysis (SA) methods has been used to solve these problems. The mostly used SA model, the Cox proportional hazards model (Cox model), has been applied to investigate the effect of covariates on the length of survival for a monetary unit.

The applied Cox model was based on the training sample and then validated with the test sample through interpretation of the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for risk groups created from the prognostic index (PI). The results show that the model correctly rank the expected LGD for new customers but is not always able to distinguish the difference between risk groups. With the results presented in the study, Nordea can get an expected LGD for newly defaulted customers, given the customers’ information on the considered covariates in this study.

This study was conducted to determine if the duration of time that cattle are fed a high-grain diet affects their absorption of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and susceptibility to, and recovery from, ruminal acidosis. Sixteen Angus heifers (BW ± SEM, 261 ± 6. 1 kg) were assigned to 1 of 4 blocks, and fed a backgrounding diet consisting of 60 % barley silage, 30 % barley grain, and 10 % supplement (DM basis). Within block, cattle were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments differing in the number of days they were fed the high-grain diet prior to an acidosis challenge: 34 d for long-adapted (LA) and 8 <b>d</b> for short-adapted (<b>SA).</b> All cattle were exposed to the same 20 -d dietary transition using 5 dietary steps until achieving the final diet that contained 9 % barley silage, 81 % barley grain, and 10 % supplement (DM basis). Data were collected during an 8 -d baseline period (BASE), on the d of the acidosis challenge (CHAL), and during two consecutive 8 d recovery periods (REC 1 and REC 2). Ruminal acidosis was induced by restricting feed to 50 % of DMI:BW for 24 h followed by an intraruminal infusion of ground barley at 10 % DMI:BW. Cows were then given their regular diet allocation 1 h after the intraruminal infusion. The duration of time fed the high-grain diet did not affect ruminal pH, lactate, or SCFA concentrations (P > 0. 050). However, during BASE and on the day of CHAL the SA heifers experienced greater linear (P = 0. 031), quadratic (P = 0. 016), and cubic (P = 0. 008) between day change in the duration of time that pH was < 5. 5 than LA heifers. Relative to BASE, inducing acidosis increased daily duration (531 to 1020 min/d; P < 0. 001) and area (176 to 595 (min × pH) /d; P < 0. 001) that pH was < 5. 5. Inducing ruminal acidosis also increased the daily mean (0. 3 to 11. 4 mM; P = 0. 013) and maximum (1. 3 to 29. 3 mM; P = 0. 008) rumen fluid lactate concentrations relative to BASE, suggesting that an acute bout of ruminal acidosis was induced. In addition, a treatment × day interaction for the duration that pH was < 5. 5 during REC 1 suggests that LA cattle tended to recover from the CHAL more rapidly than SA cattle (P = 0. 085). Indeed, analysis of covariance confirmed that the LA heifers experienced a quicker linear (P = 0. 019) recovery over time from CHAL. The greater rate of recovery possibly resulted from the LA heifers having greater rates of both fractional butyrate (45 vs. 36 %/h; P = 0. 019) and propionate absorption (42 vs. 34 %/h; P = 0. 045), and tending to have greater rates, on an absolute basis, of butyrate absorption (94 vs. 79 mmol/h; P = 0. 087) iii and, on a fractional basis, of total SCFA absorption (37 vs. 32 %/h; P = 0. 100). Treatment × period interactions revealed that LA heifers had greater serum D-lactate concentrations (P = 0. 003), and fractional rates of lactate absorption (P = 0. 024) than SA heifers, during CHAL and REC 1, respectively. When treatments were pooled, the absorption (%/h and mmol/h) of acetate, propionate, butyrate, and total SCFA increased between REC 1 and REC 2, with intermediate values for BASE (P ≤ 0. 05). Corresponding to a reduction in absorption during REC 1 (2 d post CHAL), saliva production (kg/h; P = 0. 018) increased between BASE and REC 1, with intermediate values for REC 2. These results indicate that the duration of time cattle are fed a high-grain diet may stabilize rumen pH, both prior to and after an induced bout of acute ruminal acidosis, likely through increased ruminal absorptive capacity for SCFA and lactate. In addition, this study found evidence to suggest that beef cattle possess the ability to increase saliva secretion in order to compensate for decreased absorptive capacity...|$|R

En patient avled till följd av en undvikbar läkemedelsavvikelse. Den vanligaste typen av fel var brist i rutin (n= 1255) och vanligaste konsekvensen var uteblivna doser (n= 604). Warfarin var det läkemedel som förekom i flest rapporter (n= 140), medan uteblivna/för låga doser av heparin ledde till flest allvarliga skador (n= 3). Slutenvården stod för 52 % (n= 1211) av alla rapporter och även 80 % (n= 125) av skadorna. Slutsats: Bristande rutiner kan vara en vanlig orsak till läkemedelsavvikelser. Därför behöver den svenska sjukvården satsa på att förbättra och förenkla sina rutiner, både mellan avdelningar och enskilt för att förbättra patientsäkerheten. Den har kommit en bit på väg, men behöver tydligare riktlinjer och mer utbildning och information till både avdelningar och de enskilda personer som arbetar inom sjukvården. Background: Drugs {{are the most}} common way to treat illnesses in healthcare and the best and most efficient alternative. At the same time you must keep i mind that the use of drugs is always associated with risks and side effects. These side effects or adverse drug reactions are among the leading causes of death in many countries. At least 60 % of adverse drug reactions are preventable. A preventable drug reation is called a medication error. A medication error occurs when a failure in the treatment leads to harm to the patient, or has the potential to lead to harm to the patient. The treatment process is a chain of several events, from the diagnosis of an illness and the choice of drugs, to monitoring the administration. There are many steps from start to the end that all have the potential to lead to mistakes. Medication errors can lead to great costs for healthcare, poor quality of life for the patient or even death. In Sweden it is estimated that 3150 patients die annually caused by medication errors. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe medication errors in Landstinget i Östergötland (the County Council of Östergötland) in 2011. Method: Search was done through the error report system, Synergi, with medication error as a priority. From the description in the primary text judge if the report described a medication error. Results: During 2011 2750 reports were submitted to Synergi, and 2320 of these were identified as medication errors. 6, 7 % (n= 155) of these medication errors had caused harm to the patient, one of them died due to medication error. The most common type of failure was some sort lack of routine (n= 1255) and it usually lead to errors of omission; whern a dose that should have been given was not (n= 604). Warfarin, an anticoagulantia, was the most frequent drug in the reports (n= 140), while a low dose/missed dose of heparin, another anticoagulantia, lead to harm that was classified as serious, to the patients (n= 3). MOre than halfr of the reports were fro inpatient care, 52 % (n= 1211) and also 80 % (n= 125) of medication errors that caused harm to the patients. Conclusion: Lack of routine can be a major cause of medication errors and therefore Swedish healthcare needs to improve routines and even simplify them for easier and faster access for the staff. The cooperation between members of the staff in hospitals, health centers and community home care sholud be better to improve the safety of patients. The healthcare needs more guidance and education to overcome the lack of routines and even more resources for a labor intensive activity where the need for healthcare is increasin...|$|R
