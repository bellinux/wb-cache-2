Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 86 - 92). Multisensory integration is often studied with intermodal con ict where either visual input dominates and alters the percept of simultaneous auditory input {{or the other}} way around. For instance, when put in con ict, visual stimuli can drive the perception of where a sound originates (spatial ventriloquism) [1, 2] whereas auditory stimuli can drive the perception of when visual events occur (temporal ventriloquism) [3, 4, 5]. These interactions make adaptive sense given the auditory system´s superior temporal resolution and the visual system´s superior spatial resolution [6]. Moreover, {{it was found that}} temporal ventriloquism can change the perceived speed of visual motion [7]. By taking advantage of this in uence of auditory timing on perceived speed, we investigated how audiovisual interactions in time (i. e., temporal ventriloquism) are modulated by the spatial grouping principles of vision. In our experiments, we manipulated spatial proximity, common fate and uniform connectedness between moving ashes. Observers compared the speed of motion between different auditory timing conditions. Our results revealed that auditory in uences on perceived speed were significantly modulated by only uniform connectedness. More specifically, we found that auditory effects on vision was significantly less when a horizontal gray <b>connecting</b> <b>bar</b> grouped multiple sequential moving ashes. When horizontally placed moving ashes were grouped with a vertical <b>connecting</b> <b>bar,</b> the degree of auditory in uences in time was significantly stronger compared to not grouped (control) and horizontal <b>connecting</b> <b>bar</b> conditions. The effect of auditory clicks on single apparent motion grouped with horizontal <b>connecting</b> <b>bar</b> was smaller relative to the not-grouped condition. In addition, our analysis on EEG activities revealed consistent trends in agreement with the behavioral results. Audiovisual interaction patterns were observed both earlier (around P 1) and later (around N 1 and P 2). Less auditory capture over the horizontal <b>connecting</b> <b>bar</b> condition relative to the vertical <b>connecting</b> <b>bar</b> condition was observed around 50 - 100 ms (P 1) on the frontal and temporal channels and around 200 - 300 ms (N 1) on the frontal, central, temporal and occipital-parietal channels. The larger effect of sound over the single apparent motion without <b>connecting</b> <b>bar</b> condition was observed around 50 - 100 ms and 200 - 300 ms on the central channels and 200 - 300 ms on the occipital-parietal channels. The difference between the individual effects of inner and outer sound conditions was found to be less for the horizontal <b>connecting</b> <b>bar</b> condition relative to the vertical <b>connecting</b> <b>bar</b> condition over the frontal, temporal, central and occipital-parietal channels while less individual effects of the inner and outer sound conditions on the single apparent motion with horizontal <b>connecting</b> <b>bar</b> condition relative to the without <b>connecting</b> <b>bar</b> condition was only observed over the central channels and late time intervals of the occipital-parietal and temporal channels. Overall the individual effects of both sound conditions were consistently similar on the horizontal <b>connecting</b> <b>bar</b> condition (compared to the vertical <b>connecting</b> <b>bar</b> condition) for all ROIs and on the single apparent motion with horizontal <b>connecting</b> <b>bar</b> condition (compared to the no-connecting bar condition) over the central channels. In general, our findings here suggest that temporal ventriloquism effects exist in different spatial grouping conditions of vision, but they can be also modulated by certain intra-modal grouping principles such as uniform connectedness. by Cansu Öğülmüş.

However the solution with four implants <b>connected</b> with a <b>bar</b> and a prosthetic superstructure seems to gain more trust. This study aims to present the technological steps of the four <b>connected</b> <b>bar</b> implants with an all ceramic superstructure. Two distinct situations were considered for this study: four implants connected with a normal bar and with an extension one. The numerical simulation method was employed in order to assess the tensions in the structures. The results pointed out the decreasing in tensions in the structures when the four implants were <b>connected</b> with a <b>bar</b> in compare with two single or two implants <b>connected</b> by a <b>bar</b> situations.

30|$|Breakage of spica cast {{before the}} {{intended}} {{period of application}} is a relatively common problem {{in the management of}} DDH [2, 3]. Various modifications in plastering technique have been described to strengthen the spica cast. Hosalkar et al. reported hip spica failure occurring at the pelvis-femoral junction and remedied the failure by adding a leg-to-leg <b>connecting</b> <b>bar</b> [2]. No failure was reported and patients’ carers had significant satisfaction, as the bar provided a place to carry a child in hip spica. However, this technique would require additional time and cast material to construct the <b>connecting</b> <b>bar.</b> Chaudhry et al. modified the leg-to-leg <b>connecting</b> <b>bar</b> by replacing the bar with a fibreglass bar [4]. The bar was constructed with existing fibreglass material and no pre-casting preparation of the bar was required, which reduced the procedure time. Curtis et al. published a technique of treating paediatric femoral fractures with hip spica modified into a pontoon spica that incorporated a wooden splint at the fractured side of the limb [5]. The intention was to splint the fractured femur with a stable hip spica construct and the authors recommended that it was a strong technique for children up to 10  years old. This technique would require pre-operative preparation of the wooden splint in a suitable dimension, and breakage at the thigh region (site of femur fracture) is not common in the management of DDH.|$|R

The use of the liquid ejector enables {{the operation of the}} evaporator in a flooded mode and recirculates the R 744 liquid phase, which improves the energy efficiency of the refrigeration system. The investigation was performed using two ejectors of different sizes installed in a multi-ejector block. The numerical model was formulated based on the homogenous equilibrium model and validated with the experimental results. The influence of the pre-mixer, mixer and diffuser dimensions on the ejector performance measured using the mass entrainment ratio is presented. The results show that the best liquid ejector performance was obtained for the short lengths of the pre-mixer and mixer compared to the broadly investigated two-phase <b>ejectors</b> <b>connected</b> to the evaporator port. In addition, wide diffuser angles improved the mass entrainment ratio of both liquid ejectors, which may lead to a reduction in the diffuser length...|$|R
3000|$|Efforts {{have been}} {{conducted}} to investigate the mechanical performance of splices with coupling sleeves of various geometrical and mechanical configurations, mostly under incremental tensile loading. In general, the most common failure modes for splices under incremental tensile loading have been bar fracture and bar pull-out due to grout-bar bond failure (Einea et al. 1995; Jansson 2008; Ling et al. 2012). In these circumstances, the mechanical performance of the splices essentially depends on the bond behavior between grout and bars. Test results have indicated that the mechanical performance of the splices is generally {{not as strong as}} that of the <b>connected</b> <b>bars.</b> For example, the tensile strengths and deformation capacities of the splices were lower than those of the <b>connected</b> <b>bars</b> (Einea et al. 1995; Ling et al. 2012; Kim and Lee 2012; Ling et al. 2014; Henin and Morcous 2015), e.g., the ultimate strengths and ultimate strains of 24 specimens appropriately fabricated by Ling et al. (2014) averaged 95 and 62  % of those of the <b>connected</b> <b>bars,</b> respectively. In general, appropriate geometrical configuration of coupling sleeves, adequate embedded length of bars, and high compressive strength of grout help to enhance the grout-bar bond and, therefore, improve the mechanical performance of the splices. On the other hand, limited information is available for the behavior of splices under cyclic loading. Hayashi et al. (1997) studied strength, rigidity, capacity of elongation, and the bond stress-slip relationship of splices under cyclic loading. The loading reversed 20 loops and ranged from 0.95 F [...]...|$|R

The specimens include two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) masonry walls with and without wall reinforcing <b>bars</b> or U-shaped <b>connecting</b> <b>bars,</b> which were tested under constant gravity load and repeated lateral forces. The heights of inflection point considered were 0. 67 and 1. 1 times {{the height of the}} wall measured from the top of foundation beam.

40|$|A novel three-point method using a grating {{eddy current}} {{absolute}} position sensor (GECS) for bridge deflection estimation is proposed in this paper. Real spatial {{positions of the}} measuring points along the span axis are directly used as relative reference points of each other rather than using any other auxiliary static reference points for measuring devices in a conventional method. Every three adjacent measuring points are defined as a measuring unit and a straight <b>connecting</b> <b>bar</b> with a GECS fixed on the center section of it links the two endpoints. In each measuring unit, the displacement of the mid-measuring point relative to the <b>connecting</b> <b>bar</b> measured by the GECS {{is defined as the}} relative deflection. Absolute deflections of each measuring point can be calculated from the relative deflections of all the measuring units directly without any correcting approaches. Principles of the three-point method and displacement measurement of the GECS are introduced in detail. Both static and dynamic experiments have been carried out on a simple beam bridge model, which demonstrate that the three-point deflection estimation method using the GECS is effective and offers a reliable way for bridge deflection estimation, especially for long-term monitoring...|$|R
