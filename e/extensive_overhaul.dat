5|$|Omaha {{set sail}} for Gibraltar on 30 March 1938, for {{service in the}} Mediterranean Sea. Arriving in Marseille, France, 27 April 1938, she would remain in the Mediterranean for over a year, until 2 May 1939. She visited Villefranche-sur-Mer, and Menton, France, during her time before departing from Malta, for her return to the US and an <b>extensive</b> <b>overhaul</b> from 17 June until October 1939. It was during this time that, on 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, {{starting}} what would become World War II.|$|E
5|$|On 14 April, Maryland {{left the}} firing line at Okinawa and escorted several {{retiring}} transports. They steamed via the Mariana Islands and Guam to Pearl Harbor, and {{she reached the}} Puget Sound Navy Yard at Bremerton on 7 May for <b>extensive</b> <b>overhaul.</b> All of her 5in guns were removed and replaced by sixteen 5inch/38 cal guns in new twin mounts. Turret No. 3 was repaired and the crew quarters were improved. She completed repairs in August, leaving for tests and training runs just as Japan surrendered, ending the war.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May 1957 the BBC {{produced}} a live outside broadcast from the railway, during which Wynford Vaughan Thomas and Huw Weldon commentated {{on a trip}} from Dolgoch to Abergynolwyn. The publicity from this broadcast drew substantial numbers of visitors to the railway that summer, with more than 57,500passengers carried, and this increase in revenue in turn enabled the railway to continue to improve its infrastructure and provide tourists with a better experience. The following year locomotive No.1 Talyllyn returned to steam after an <b>extensive</b> <b>overhaul.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2003, TCRT No. 1300 {{underwent}} <b>extensive</b> <b>overhauling</b> of {{its internal}} wiring, exterior, and internal wood and steel support structure as it hadn't {{had a major}} overhaul/rebuilding since the late 1940s. This was done for preparation for its 100th birthday in 2008.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 108 AMX-10Ps {{remaining}} in service with the French Army underwent <b>extensive</b> <b>overhauls</b> {{to improve their}} armour and mobility between 2006 and 2008, including new gearboxes and suspension systems. They are gradually being retired and replaced by the wheeled Véhicule Blindé de Combat d'Infanterie.|$|R

5|$|Kaiserin Augusta served abroad between 1897 and 1902, {{primarily}} in the East Asia Squadron {{under the command of}} Admiral Otto von Diederichs. During this time, the ship's crew assisted in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. In 1902, she returned to Germany for an <b>extensive</b> <b>overhaul</b> that lasted until 1907, after which she went into reserve. Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Kaiserin Augusta was mobilized to serve as a gunnery training ship. She served in this role throughout the war; the ship was ultimately sold for scrapping in October 1919 and broken up the following year.|$|E
5|$|The peacetime {{training}} regimen for Arkansas {{consisted of}} individual training, an annual fleet maneuver, and periodic maintenance in drydock. She {{also participated in}} gunnery and engineering competitions. After returning to the United States, Arkansas went into drydock at the Norfolk Navy Yard for an <b>extensive</b> <b>overhaul.</b> She then rejoined the fleet to conduct training exercises off Cuba, after which she crossed the Atlantic, bound for Europe. She reached Plymouth, on 12 May 1919, and then took weather observations on 19 May, and later served as a reference vessel to guide the Navy Curtiss NC flying boats flying from Trepassey Bay, Newfoundland, to Europe. After completing that task, she steamed to Brest, on 10 June, and picked up Admiral William S. Benson, the Chief of Naval Operations, and his wife. Arkansas carried them back to New York, after Benson was finished at the Peace Conference in Paris, arriving on 20 June.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Bretagne was based in Toulon. At the time, Italy remained neutral, {{so there was no}} immediate threat to the Mediterranean Fleet. In December, Bretagne covered convoy traffic in the Atlantic. On 4 December, she and Provence, along with the cruisers Colbert, Dupleix, and Primauguet and several destroyers and submarines operated out of Dakar. Around the middle of the month, the task force began to return to the Mediterranean. After returning to Toulon, Bretagne underwent an <b>extensive</b> <b>overhaul,</b> which lasted until 3 March 1940. On 11 March, she left France carrying 1,820 boxes of gold bars from the French treasury along with the cruiser Algérie, which carried another 1,179 boxes. They arrived in Halifax on 10 April. On the return voyage, they escorted two American merchant ships carrying 82 aircraft bought by France and arrived at Toulon on 10 April. On 27 April, Bretagne and her two sisters were transferred to Alexandria. Bretagne and Provence returned to Mers El Kébir on 18 May.|$|E
25|$|By 1980s the {{original}} Bedek maintenance business was conducting <b>extensive</b> <b>overhauls</b> {{on dozens of}} different aircraft types, working on engines as well as airframes and interiors, IAI could provide more comprehensive refurbishments than even the aircraft manufacturers themselves. The unit had 4,000 employees by the mid-1980s and overhauled a huge range of aircraft, from propeller-driven trainers to airliners; including big civil aviation programs, such as conversion of Boeing 747s to freighters.|$|R
500|$|Designed as a {{more heavily}} armed {{improvement}} over the previous , the New York class was the first battleship to feature the /45 caliber gun, but {{was one of the}} last battleship classes designed with several features, including a five-turret layout and coal for fuel. The class also suffered several deficiencies such as a lack of anti-aircraft weaponry and armor layout, which were addressed with the subsequent [...] Because of these deficiencies, both ships saw several <b>extensive</b> <b>overhauls</b> over the course of their careers which greatly changed their profiles.|$|R
50|$|Orleck {{underwent}} an <b>extensive</b> FRAM I <b>overhaul</b> in 1962.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the attack}} on convoy SLS 64, Admiral Hippers fuel stocks were running low. She {{therefore}} returned to Brest on 15 February. British bombers were regularly attacking the port, however, and the Kriegsmarine therefore decided Admiral Hipper should return to Germany, where she could be better protected. Before the ship could leave, damage caused to the ship's hull by wrecks in the harbor had to be repaired. On 15 March, the ship slipped out of Brest, unobserved, and passed through the Denmark Strait eight days later. While en route, Admiral Hipper stopped to refuel in Bergen. By 28 March, the cruiser was docked in Kiel, having made the entire journey without being detected by the British. Upon arrival, the ship went into the Deutsche Werke shipyard for an <b>extensive</b> <b>overhaul,</b> which lasted for seven months. After completion of the refit, Admiral Hipper conducted sea trials in the Baltic before putting into Gotenhafen on 21 December for some minor refitting. In January 1942, the ship had her steam turbines overhauled at the Blohm & Voss shipyard; a degaussing coil was fitted to the ship's hull during this overhaul. By March, the ship was again fully operational.|$|E
5|$|Louisiana {{underwent}} an <b>extensive</b> <b>overhaul</b> {{after returning}} from the voyage, after which she conducted training maneuvers in the Atlantic. Captain Washington Irving Chambers took command of the ship on 1 June. On 1 November 1910, she {{was assigned to the}} 2nd Division of the Atlantic Fleet, which crossed the Atlantic to visit British and French cities. A second trip to Europe followed in 1911, this time to the Baltic Sea. There, the ships stopped in Copenhagen, Denmark, Trälhavet, Sweden, Kronstadt, Russia, and Kiel, Germany. They were inspected by the monarchs of each country. The worsening unrest of the Mexican Revolution led the United States to begin intervening in the conflict to protect American interests; in support of these interventions, Louisiana made three trips to Mexico between July 1913 and September 1915. The first lasted from 6 July to 29 December 1913. The second, from 14 April to 8 August 1914, supported the United States occupation of Veracruz. The third deployment lasted from 17 August to 24 September 1915.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh {{arrived in}} Australia in October 1914 {{to take up}} his duties, and was {{immediately}} faced with major difficulties. Without warning or notification, Shackleton had cut the Ross Sea party's allocated funds in half, from £2,000 to £1,000. Mackintosh was instructed {{to make up the}} difference by soliciting free gifts, and to mortgage the expedition's ship to raise further money. It then emerged that the purchase of Aurora had not been legally completed, which delayed Mackintosh's attempts to mortgage it. Also, Aurora was unfit for Antarctic work without an <b>extensive</b> <b>overhaul,</b> which required co-operation from an exasperated Australian Government. The task of dealing with these difficulties within a very restricted timescale caused Mackintosh great anxiety, and the various muddles created a negative image of the expedition in the eyes of the Australian public. Some members of the party resigned, others were dismissed; recruiting a full complement of crew and scientific staff involved some last-minute appointments which left the party noticeably short of Antarctic experience.|$|E
50|$|An <b>extensive</b> design <b>overhaul</b> {{and rebuild}} was required, which was {{completed}} in 2008. The project was initially expected to cost $30 million in 1988, but costs ultimately rose to $350 million.|$|R
50|$|The shed {{stood next}} to the 1920s bus garage of the same company to the south of Barnsley town centre. The shed had four running tracks and an <b>extensive</b> yard. <b>Overhaul</b> {{workshops}} were situated {{to the back of the}} shed.|$|R
50|$|During the 1920s, {{production}} of boats, canvas work {{and numerous other}} articles {{for the needs of}} the service were stepped up. <b>Extensive</b> <b>overhauls</b> and repairs were performed on the then-modern vessels Yamacraw, Seneca, Seminole and many 100', 125' patrol boats and tugs. The 500 workers of the depot included civilian employees along with enlisted men. In 1928, there were 245 wage board and 2 classified employees on the civilian payrolls. The military complement was 250. The work load was flexible, increasing considerably in the summer months and decreasing in the winter months. Its small boats were famed throughout the world, wherever lifesaving stations were located or cutters patrolled the seas. The depot's production was excellent.|$|R
5|$|After repairs, {{she joined}} Task Group 51 under Rear Admiral Harry W. Hill {{for an attack}} on Darrit, {{steaming}} for that island on 23 January and arriving 30 January. After shelling the island for 30 minutes, it was discovered no Japanese were ashore. She then moved to support operations on Eniwetok Atoll on 8 February, providing shore bombardment on Parry Island ahead of landings which took place on 19 February. She then screened carriers conducting airstrikes at Palau, Yap, Ulithi, and Woleai between 30 March and 1 April. She then joined with a carrier force assigned to cover the landings around Hollandia and Tanahmerah on New Guinea, which took place from 21–24 April. She steamed northward with the carrier force and struck Truk with five other cruisers and destroyers. Portland then bombarded Satawan in the Nomei Group. Following this series of operations, Portland returned to Mare Island for a more <b>extensive</b> <b>overhaul,</b> which was completed in August. She returned to the western Pacific for shore bombardments of Peleliu from 12–14 September. The cruiser supported the landing on Peleliu on 15 September, providing artillery to support the advance of Allied forces. She provided gunfire support at Peleliu through 29 September, and then steamed for Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island in the Admiralties.|$|E

25|$|In July 1964, Tullibee {{participated in}} fleet {{exercises}} in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) tactics with NATO units. The submarine resumed developmental work in 1965 and operated in this capacity {{into the fall}} of that year. On 28 October, her home port was temporarily changed to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, when the ship entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, for an <b>extensive</b> <b>overhaul.</b> She remained in drydock for 754 days (2 years and 24 days), emerging on 2 January 1968.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, Flyer had an <b>extensive</b> <b>overhaul</b> and {{conversion}} to oil fuel {{to allow her}} to compete with the newer steel steamers that the Puget Sound Navigation Company had purchased in the Great Lakes and brought round South America. One in particular, Indianapolis, was being placed on the Seattle-Tacoma run in direct opposition to the Flyer. Passenger traffic on Puget Sound was then very high. In 1907, so many people wanted to travel to Tacoma on the Flyer that they were regularly turned away at the dock.|$|E
25|$|The ship {{went back}} across the Atlantic June 1945 after being away {{eighteen}} months, saluting fallen comrades at Normandy on the way. The ship was actually assigned to the Pacific Fleet, in anticipation of redeployment {{to the war in}} the Pacific. Most people expected the war with Japan to continue into 1946 or 1947 (no one knew about the atom bomb) and the ship went through an <b>extensive</b> <b>overhaul</b> prior to joining the Pacific Fleet. Finally, the war with Japan ended prior to the competition of the overhaul; the ship relaxed and was opened to the public for Navy Day.|$|E
5000|$|One of London's largest {{redevelopment}} projects, King's Cross Central, began {{construction in}} 2008 {{across the road}} from the station. Islington council and Transport for London (TfL) commissioned a study in 2005 to consider the possible reopening of the station. At the same time, however, it was recognised that other transport priorities reduced the likelihood of such a project moving forward in the near future. The site would need <b>extensive</b> <b>overhauls</b> to bring the station up to modern day standards, at a cost estimated at £21 million in 2005. Local political groups have been keen to see the station reopened in order to reduce passenger congestion at [...] and to encourage development in the surrounding community. The Liberal Democrats advocated the reopening of the station in their 2006 local election manifesto, and at least one candidate for the Conservative Party similarly campaigned for the station to be reopened.|$|R
50|$|Prior to Brock, he was Provost and Vice-Rector at Concordia University in Montreal, {{where he}} is {{credited}} for leading an <b>extensive</b> academic planning <b>overhaul</b> while under difficult budget constraints.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s 78 of the Gearing-class destroyers {{underwent}} <b>extensive</b> modernization <b>overhauls,</b> known as FRAM I, which {{were designed to}} convert them from an anti-aircraft destroyer to an anti-submarine warfare platform. FRAM I removed all of the DDR and DDE equipment, and these ships were redesignated as DDs. FRAM I and FRAM II conversions were completed 1960-65. Eventually all but four Gearings received FRAM conversions.|$|R
