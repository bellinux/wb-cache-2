60|$|In eluding {{a direct}} appeal Gwendolen {{recovered}} {{some of her}} self-possession. She spoke with dignity and looked straight at Grandcourt, whose long, narrow, impenetrable eyes met hers, and mysteriously arrested them: mysteriously; for the subtly-varied drama between man and woman is often such as can hardly be rendered in words put together like dominoes, according to obvious <b>fixed</b> <b>marks.</b> The word of all work, Love, will no more express the myriad modes of mutual attraction, than the word Thought can inform you what is passing through your neighbor's mind. It {{would be hard to}} tell on which side--Gwendolen's or Grandcourt's--the influence was more mixed. At that moment his strongest wish was to be completely master of this creature--this piquant combination of maidenliness and mischief: that she knew things which had made her start away from him, spurred him to triumph over that repugnance; and he was believing that he should triumph. And she--ah, piteous equality in the need to dominate!--she was overcome like the thirsty one who is drawn toward the seeming water in the desert, overcome by the suffused sense that here in this man's homage to her lay the rescue from helpless subjection to an oppressive lot.|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{the very}} high {{potential}} boat speeds, iceboat race courses are established around <b>fixed</b> <b>marks</b> which are to be rounded in a one-way route. The courses are deliberately set {{in a straight line}} upwind and downwind, though the boats have to tack back and forth to advance through the course. This course configuration provides a measure of traffic safety between competitors. Also, by directing the iceboat straight upwind or straight downwind, the sailor can best control and prevent the sail from generating excessive horsepower, resulting in the slowest directions of travel.

40|$|For a <b>fixed</b> <b>marked</b> surface S, we {{construct}} polynomial bounds on {{the periodic}} and preperiodic lengths of the maximal splitting sequences of a projectively invariant measured train track.

Similarly, this is the dual to the previously known result that the conjugacy problem is in NP. As usual, in both cases we immediately obtain exponential time solutions to these problems. A version of these algorithms have been implemented as part of flipper. Comment: 26 pages, 6 figures, updated abstract, introduction and added section detailing the conjugacy proble...|$|R

40|$|Problems {{may arise}} {{in the process of}} reading, teaching, and writing the English-language short story. Many {{contemporaneous}} stories seem wildly experimental, trendy, trivial with low reader-identification—not models of narrative virtuosity like stories in the earlier 1900 s. Teaching this literary genre becomes difficult when those and other familiar “chestnuts ” fill literature anthologies. And, the creative instructor, wishing to write and publish stories and apply the experience to classroom teaching, is restricted by the tight network of influential writing workshops/schools countrywide, and their powerful editorial contacts. This article will exemplify the above issues, and suggest strategic procedures as possible remedies. The English-language short story has the potential of beginning in delight and ending in wisdom (to paraphrase Robert Frost) and of being a <b>fixèd</b> <b>mark</b> by which we can measure how much our minds have grown. To those who are concerned with reading, teaching, and even writing the English Language short story, any or all of the three actions just named, may sooner or later bring about frustration, disappointment, and/or a feeling of being unable to help th...|$|R
40|$|For a <b>fixed</b> <b>marked</b> surface S, we {{show that}} the problem of {{deciding}} whether or not a mapping class is reducible lies in NP. As usual this immediately gives an exponential time algorithm {{to decide whether or not}} a mapping class is reducible. To do this we use an (ideal) triangulation to obtain a coordinate system on the set of multicurves on S. The result then follows from the fact that the action of the mapping class group of S is piecewise-linear with respect to such a coordinate system and so we are able so show that: if a mapping class h fixes a multicurve then it fixes one whose size is at most exponential in the word length of h. We go on to show how to repeat this construction on invariant subsurfaces. This allows us to show that a similar bound holds for the size of the canonical curve system of a mapping class and so give an alternate, elementary proof of a result of Koberda and Mangahas.

60|$|Rousseau made {{a mistake}} when he {{supposed}} that his ideas were just as applicable to instrumental as they were to vocal music. The requirements of the singer are not those of the player. To a performer on the piano, who has to light rapidly and simultaneously {{on a number of}} tones, or to a violinist who has to leap through several octaves with great rapidity, the most urgent need is that of a definite and <b>fixed</b> <b>mark,</b> by which the absolute pitch of each successive tone may be at once recognised. Neither of these has any time to think about the melodious relation of the tones; it is quite {{as much as they can}} do to find their place on the key-board or the string. Rousseau's scheme, or any similar one, fails to supply the clear and obvious index to pitch supplied by the old system. Old Rameau pointed this out to Rousseau when the scheme was laid before him, and Rousseau admitted that the objection was decisive,[330] though his admission was not practically deterrent.|$|R

40|$|Recently, denial-of-service (DoS) attack {{has become}} a {{pressing}} problem {{due to the lack}} of an efficient method to locate the real attackers and ease of launching an attack with readily available source codes on the Internet. Traceback is a subtle scheme to tackle DoS attacks. Probabilistic packet marking (PPM) is a new way for practical IP traceback. Although PPM enables a victim to pinpoint the attacker’s origin to within 2 – 5 equally possible sites, it has been shown that PPM suffers from uncertainty under spoofed marking attack. Furthermore, the uncertainty factor can be amplified significantly under distributed DoS attack, which may diminish the effectiveness of PPM. In this work, we present a new approach, called dynamic probabilistic packet marking (DPPM), to further improve the effectiveness of PPM. Instead of using a <b>fixed</b> <b>marking</b> probability, we propose to deduce the traveling distance of a packet and then choose a proper marking probability. DPPM may completely remove uncertainty and enable victims to precisely pinpoint the attacking origin even under spoofed marking DoS attacks. DPPM supports incremental deployment. Formal analysis indicates that DPPM outperforms PPM in most aspects...|$|R

There is not a lot of necessity for Micron, at least over the next five years, to be spending a lot of money on 450mm.

And the value at the end of the day - so that customers would buy that equipment - I think is dubious.” As of March 2014, Intel Corporation expects 450 mm deployment by 2020 (by the end of this decade). Mark LaPedus of semiengineering.com reported in mid-2014 that chipmakers had delayed adoption of 450 mm “for the foreseeable future.” According to this report some observers expect 2018 to 2020, while “G.
