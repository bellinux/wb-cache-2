5|$|Each block {{had access}} to courtyards, known as airing courts, and the asylum was {{surrounded}} by extensive grounds. At {{the end of each}} courtyard were stone rooms used to house <b>incontinent</b> patients, who slept on straw beds. All buildings were made from stone and iron, avoiding the use of wood because of the potential fire hazard. Hot and cold plunge baths were also included, as Fox saw their use as an important part of treatment, which may have been related to his Quaker beliefs and John Wesley's advocacy of the practice. The total construction cost around £35,000. In addition to the wealthy private patients, paupers funded by parish funds were also admitted and kept in accommodation furthest from the central block, which was for the highest in society.|$|E
25|$|After the lobotomy, {{it quickly}} became {{apparent}} that the procedure was not successful. Kennedy's mental capacity diminished to that of a two-year-old child. She could not walk or speak intelligibly and was <b>incontinent.</b>|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{following}} surgery, {{patients were}} often stuporous, confused, and <b>incontinent.</b> Some developed an enormous appetite and gained considerable weight. Seizures were another common complication of surgery. Emphasis {{was put on}} the training of patients {{in the weeks and months}} following surgery.|$|E
25|$|Insects are {{valuable}} as forensic indicators {{in cases of}} abuse and neglect. Some insects, such as the Green Bottle Fly, (Lucilia sericata (Meigen)), are drawn to odors, such as ammonia, resulting from urine or fecal contamination. Adult green bottle flies tend to be attracted to an <b>incontinent</b> individual who lacks the voluntary control of excretory functions. Such examples include a baby who has not had its diapers changed often or an <b>incontinent</b> elderly person {{who has not been}} helped in maintaining routine bodily hygiene. Flies lay their eggs in and around clothing and skin which, if left undiscovered, will hatch into maggots (larvae) which begin feeding upon flesh, open wounds, ulcers, and any natural bodily entry point. Over time, the flesh will be eaten away, and the region may be further infected by bacteria or invaded by other insects. This is known as myiasis.|$|E
25|$|Diapers and diaperlike {{products}} are sometimes used on pets, laboratory animals, or working animals. This is often {{due to the}} animal not being housebroken, or for older, sick, or injured pets who have become <b>incontinent.</b> In some cases, these are simply baby diapers with holes cut for the tails to fit through. In other cases, they are diaperlike waste collection devices.|$|E
25|$|Extravagant {{courses are}} served while Trimalchio flaunts his wealth and his pretence of {{learning}} (31–41). Trimalchio's departure {{to the toilet}} (he is <b>incontinent)</b> allows space for conversation among the guests (41–46). Encolpius listens to their ordinary talk about their neighbours, about the weather, about the hard times, about the public games, and about the education of their children. In his insightful depiction of everyday Roman life, Petronius delights in exposing the vulgarity and pretentiousness of the illiterate and ostentatious wealthy of his age.|$|E
25|$|FI {{is a sign}} or a symptom, not a diagnosis, and {{represents}} an extensive list of causes. Usually, it {{is the result of}} a complex interplay of several coexisting factors, many of which may be simple to correct. Up to 80% of people may have more than one abnormality that is contributing. Deficits of individual functional components of the continence mechanism can be partially compensated for a certain period of time, until the compensating components themselves fail. For example, obstetric injury may precede onset by decades, but postmenopausal changes in the tissue strength reduce in turn the competence of the compensatory mechanisms. The most common factors in the development are thought to be obstetric injury and after effects of anorectal surgery, especially those involving the anal sphincters and hemorrhoidal vascular cushions. The majority of <b>incontinent</b> persons over the age of 18 fall into one of several groups: those with structural anorectal abnormalities (sphincter trauma, sphincter degeneration, perianal fistula, rectal prolapse), neurological disorders (multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, spina bifida, stroke, etc.), constipation/fecal loading (presence of a large amount of feces in the rectum with stool of any consistency), cognitive and/or behavioral dysfunction (dementia, learning disabilities), diarrhea, inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g. ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease), irritable bowel syndrome, disability related (people who are frail, acutely unwell, or have chronic/acute disabilities), and those cases which are idiopathic (of unknown cause). Diabetes mellitus is also known to be a cause, but the mechanism of this relationship is not well understood.|$|E
500|$|Following the FDA's actions, Scientology {{attracted}} increasingly unfavorable publicity {{across the}} English-speaking world. It faced particularly hostile scrutiny in Victoria, Australia, {{where it was}} accused of brainwashing, blackmail, extortion and damaging {{the mental health of}} its members. The Victorian state government established a Board of Inquiry into Scientology in November 1963. Its report, published in October 1965, condemned every aspect of Scientology and Hubbard himself. He was described as being of doubtful sanity, having a persecution complex and displaying strong indications of paranoid schizophrenia with delusions of grandeur. His writings were characterized as nonsensical, abounding in [...] "self-glorification and grandiosity, replete with histrionics and hysterical, <b>incontinent</b> outbursts". Sociologist Roy Wallis comments that the report drastically changed public perceptions of Scientology: ...|$|E

2500|$|A diaper or nappy is an {{absorbent}} garment for <b>incontinent</b> people. The dampless or waterproof diaper {{was invented}} in 1946 when Marion Donovan used a shower curtain from her bathroom to create the [...] "Boater", the first re-usable and leak-proof diaper that contained plastic-lined cloth. Donovan's other innovation was replacing safety pins with plastic snaps {{on the sides of}} diapers. First sold in 1949 at Saks Fifth Avenue's flagship store in New York City, patents were later issued in 1951 to Donovan who later sold the rights to the waterproof diaper for $1 million.|$|E
2500|$|Vaginal {{birth injury}} with visible tears or episiotomies are common. Internal tissue tearing {{as well as}} nerve damage to the pelvic {{structures}} lead in a proportion of women to problems with prolapse, incontinence of stool or urine and sexual dysfunction. Fifteen percent of women become <b>incontinent,</b> to some degree, of stool or urine after normal delivery, this number rising considerably after these women reach menopause. Vaginal birth injury is a necessary, but not sufficient, cause of all non hysterectomy related prolapse in later life. Risk factors for significant vaginal birth injury include: ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the early}} 20th century a more {{negative}} image of Hathaway emerged, following {{the publication of}} Frank Harris's books on Shakespeare's love life, and after the discovery that Anne was already pregnant when the couple married. A trend in literature on Hathaway in this period was to imagine her as a sexually <b>incontinent</b> cradle-snatcher, or, alternatively, a calculating shrew. More recent literature has included more varied representations of her. Historian Katherine Scheil describes Hathaway as a [...] "wife-shaped void" [...] used by modern writers [...] "as a canvas for expressing contemporary woman's struggles — over independence, single motherhood, sexual freedom, unfaithful husbands, woman's education and power-relations between husband and wife." ...|$|E
2500|$|Case 4. This case {{illustrates}} pure autonomic status epilepticus with EEG midline spikes {{and subsequent}} rolandic seizures with centrotemporal spikes. A 9-year-old boy returned from school one day looking tired and pale. Five minutes later, he complained of headache and became agitated and paler. Within 5 minutes, he started banging {{his head on}} the wall and soon became unresponsive and floppy “like a rag doll,” as well as <b>incontinent</b> of urine and feces with his eyes widely open and pupils markedly dilated. At this stage, he vomited vigorously. This condition continued {{on his way to the}} hospital where he arrived by ambulance half an hour from onset. Three hours later, he was still confused, partly unresponsive, pale, and quiet, and he vomited again. Recovery started 4 hours from onset. He did not convulse at any stage. He was apyrexial, and other autonomic functions were normal. He slept and was entirely normal the next morning, discharged home with the diagnosis “epileptic seizure? probably atypical migraine.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Genie's {{gross motor}} skills were {{extremely}} weak; she could neither {{stand up straight}} nor fully straighten any of her limbs, and had very little endurance. Her movements were very hesitant and unsteady and her characteristic [...] "bunny walk", in which she held her {{hands in front of}} her like claws while ambulating, suggested extreme difficulty with sensory processing and an inability to integrate visual and tactile information. Kent was somewhat surprised to find her fine motor skills were significantly better, determining they were at approximately the level of a two-year-old. She could not chew and had very severe dysphagia, totally incapable of swallowing solid or even soft food and barely able to swallow liquids. When eating she held anything she could not swallow in her mouth until her saliva broke it down, and if this took too long she spat it out and mashed it with her fingers. She was also completely <b>incontinent,</b> and did not respond to extreme temperatures.|$|E
2500|$|Stalin's aide Vasili Lozgachev {{reported}} that Beria and Malenkov {{were the first}} members of the Politburo to investigate Stalin's condition after his stroke. They arrived at Stalin's dacha at Kuntsevo at 03:00 on 2 March after being called by Khrushchev and Bulganin. The latter two {{did not want to}} risk Stalin's wrath by checking themselves. [...] Lozgachev tried in futility to explain to Beria that the then-unconscious Stalin (still in his soiled clothing) was [...] "sick and needed medical attention." [...] Beria angrily dismissed his claims as panic-mongering and quickly left, ordering him, [...] "Don't bother us, don't cause a panic and don't disturb Comrade Stalin!" [...] Calling a doctor was deferred for a full 12 hours after Stalin was rendered paralyzed, <b>incontinent,</b> and unable to speak. [...] This decision is noted as [...] "extraordinary" [...] by the historian Simon Sebag-Montefiore, but also consistent with the standard Stalinist policy of deferring all decision-making (no matter how necessary or obvious) without official orders from higher authority.|$|E
2500|$|Case 8. This case {{illustrates}} {{that children with}} Panayiotopoulos syndrome may be misdiagnosed and treated for encephalitis. This boy had a first seizure at age 4 years and 2 months. Whilst sleeping in his mother’s lap, he suddenly vomited. Then his eyes stared into the space upwards, his head deviated to the right, his face turned green and he became <b>incontinent</b> of urine and faeces. The seizure lasted for 15 min {{and there were no}} convulsions. Abdominal ultrasound performed because of the vomiting was normal. A second seizure occurred 16 months later at age 5 years and 6 months. At around 10 in the morning he walked into lounge looking pale and irritable. He fell to the floor and developed writhing movements, shaking arms and legs, hypersalivation and incontinence of urine. Convulsions stopped 15 min later with rectal diazepam. He recovered but remained very sleepy. He was febrile ~38.5°C. He was treated in a major teaching hospital with triple therapy for suspected encephalitis but in the third day after admission this was stopped and he was discharged home. Brain CT scan, EEG and CSF were normal. [...] Subsequent EEGs showed infrequent occipital and frontal spikes. [...] At follow-up aged 7, he was normal and had experienced no further seizures.|$|E
2500|$|A {{competition}} {{was held to}} design the new hospital at Southwark in which the noted Bethlem patient James Tilly Matthews was an unsuccessful entrant. The Governors elected to give James Lewis the task. Incorporating the best elements from the three winning competition designs, he produced a building in the neoclassical style that, while drawing heavily on Hooke's original plan, eschewed the ornament of its predecessor. Completed after three years in 1815, it was constructed during {{the first wave of}} county asylum building in England under the County Asylum Act ("Wynn's Act") of 1808. Extending to [...] in length, the new hospital, which ran alongside the Lambeth Road, consisted of a central block with two wings of three storeys on either side. Female patients occupied the west wing and males the east; as at Moorfields, the cells were located off galleries that traversed each wing. Each gallery contained only one toilet, a sink and cold baths. <b>Incontinent</b> patients were kept on beds of straw in cells in the basement gallery; this space also contained rooms with fireplaces for attendants. A wing for the criminally insane– a legal category newly minted {{in the wake of the}} trial of a delusional James Hadfield for attempted regicide– was completed in 1816. This addition, which housed 45 men and 15 women, was wholly financed by the state.|$|E

60|$|A {{blinding}} flash {{went over}} his brain, his body jolted. His heart had burst into flame. His consciousness was gone into his wrists, into his hands.

60|$|Now, Carruthers was an idiot. No {{doubt he}} (Trysdale) had been guilty (he {{sometimes}} did such things) of airing {{at the club}} some old, canting Castilian proverb dug from the hotchpotch {{at the back of}} dictionaries. Carruthers, who was one of his <b>incontinent</b> admirers, was the very man to have magnified this exhibition of doubtful erudition.|$|E

60|$|A general silence {{followed}} the sudden rebuke {{of this very}} rich man. The subject, however, was too interesting to be readily abandoned.

60|$|At Nepi he was awaited by {{his brother}} Giuffredo, who had preceded him thither from Rome. A shadowy personage this Giuffredo, whose {{unimportant}} personality is tantalizingly elusive in the pages where mention is made of him.
