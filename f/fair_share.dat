The crusade seemed to have gone well for the Christian side but, after Pius' death, the remaining cardinals lost their hope and handed the money raised for the crusade to the Venetians. Mehmed saw Skanderbeg's vulnerability and sent Ballaban Badera, an Albanian janissary, to Albania where they met at Vaikal and he was defeated. Ballaban had replaced Şeremet as the commander in Ohrid after the latter fell out of favor with the sultan. Ballaban would meet Skanderbeg several more times in battle before being mortally wounded in action at the second siege of Krujë.|$|E
5|$|Chikka Devaraja (r. 1672–1704), {{the most}} notable of Mysore's early kings, who ruled during much of this period, managed to not only survive the exigencies but further {{expanded}} territory. He achieved this by forging strategic alliances with the Marathas and the Mughals. The kingdom soon grew to include Salem and Bangalore to the east, Hassan to the west, Chikkamagaluru and Tumkur {{to the north and}} the rest of Coimbatore to the south. Despite this expansion, the kingdom, which now accounted for a <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> of land in the southern Indian heartland, extending from the Western Ghats to the western boundaries of the Coromandel plain, remained landlocked without direct coastal access. Chikka Devaraja's attempts to remedy this brought Mysore into conflict with the Nayaka chiefs of Ikkeri and the kings (Rajas) of Kodagu (modern Coorg); who between them controlled the Kanara coast (coastal areas of modern Karnataka) and the intervening hill region respectively. The conflict brought mixed results with Mysore annexing Periyapatna but suffering a reversal at Palupare.|$|E
40|$|Wireless packet {{scheduling}} {{has been}} a popular paradigm to provide packet-level quality of services (QoS), in terms of throughput, delay and <b>fair</b> <b>sharing,</b> over error-prone channels. However, the state-of-the-art scheduling solutions are designed for single-rate environments. They cannot exploit the multi-rate capacility offered by the physical layer of the current WLANs. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Wireless Fair Scheduling (AWFS), which oppotunistically exploits the multirate feature and provides packet-level QoS {{in the presence of}} channel errors. AWFS departs from the throughput-oriented fairness and compensation, and adopts temporal <b>fair</b> <b>sharing</b> and <b>fair</b> compensation defined in virtual time. It offers a packet-level solution that ensures virtual temporal share, works with variable packet size and occaasionally idle flows, and operates in the infrastructure mode.

40|$|I use an {{unbalanced}} panel data {{to explore}} the correlation between aggregate income per capita and income inequality. A lot of studies document controversial results using the Gini index or other summary measurements of income inequality. I measure income inequality by the two dimensions of a point on the Lorenz Curve, where the Lorenz curve has unit slope. It is called the fair division point, which involves the <b>fair</b> population <b>share</b> and the <b>fair</b> income <b>share.</b> The difference between the <b>fair</b> population <b>share</b> and the <b>fair</b> income <b>share</b> approximates the Gini index of an income distribution. My analysis shows that a country’s low income population relatively decreases (the <b>fair</b> population <b>share</b> drops slightly) as the economy grows; {{and at the same}} time, those low income households are relatively worse off (the <b>fair</b> income <b>share</b> falls even though the GDP per capita increases). Inversely, as an economy becomes rich, there are more low income households (the <b>fair</b> population <b>share</b> increases), but those low income households are better off (the <b>fair</b> income <b>share</b> goes up and GDP per capita increases as well). Overall, both the Gini index and the difference between the <b>fair</b> population <b>share</b> and the <b>fair</b> income <b>share</b> have been increasing during the last half century in the panel of countries. Therefore, income inequality increases as an economy is getting richer. The analysis presents significant evidence for optimum income inequality regarding both the aggregate productivity and the growth rate of GDP, where income inequality is measured by either the Gini index or the <b>fair</b> division <b>shares.</b> But no evidence has been found for the Kuznets’ hypothesis. Both high and low inequality of income distribution could harm an economy as we compare with its potential optimum inequality. Also developed economies show different optimum inequality from that in developing economies, and there is the growth-worst <b>fair</b> population <b>share</b> that results in the lowest growth in developed economies. Measurement of income inequality matters on its economic effects for the subsamples of the panel data. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Internet is {{experiencing}} an explosive growth of video traffic. Given the limited network bandwidth resources, {{how to provide}} Internet users with good video playback Quality of Service (QoS) is a key problem. For video clips competing bandwidth, we propose an approach of Content-Aware distortion-Fair (CAF) video delivery scheme, which {{is aware of the}} characteristics of video frames and ensures max-min distortion <b>fair</b> <b>sharing</b> among video flows. Different from bandwidth <b>fair</b> <b>sharing,</b> CAF targets end-to-end video playback quality fairness among users since users care about video quality rather than bandwidth. The proposed CAF approach does not require ratedistortion modeling of the source, which is difficult to estimate, but instead, it exploits the temporal prediction structure of the video sequences along with a frame drop distortion metric to guide resource allocations and coordinations. Experimental results show that the proposed approach operates with limited overhead in computation and communication, and yields better quality of service, especially when the network is congested. Compared with content-blind approaches, CAF enables QoS <b>fair</b> <b>sharing</b> of resources with more efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Shared storage {{services}} enjoy wide adoption in commercial clouds. But most systems today provide weak performance isolation and fairness between tenants, if at all. Most approaches to multi-tenant resource allocation are based either on per-VM allocations or hard rate limits that assume uniform workloads to achieve high utilization. Instead, Pisces, our system for shared key-value storage, achieves datacenterwide per-tenant performance isolation and fairness. Pisces achieves per-tenant weighted <b>fair</b> <b>sharing</b> of system resources {{across the entire}} shared service, even when partitions belonging to different tenants are co-located and when demand for different partitions is skewed or timevarying. The focus {{of this paper is}} to highlight the optimization model that motivates the decomposition of Pisces’s <b>fair</b> <b>sharing</b> problem into four complementary mechanisms— partition placement, weight allocation, replica selection, and weighted fair queuing—that operate on different time-scales to provide system-wide max-min fairness.
