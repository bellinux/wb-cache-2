40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{constrained}} optimization of non-orthogonal, spatially localized orbitals using direct energy minimization techniques, {{in the context}} of electronic structure calculations, is presented. The variationally localized search direction (VLSD) method, as it was named, ensures that strict localization constraints are imposed upon the search <b>direction</b> <b>vectors</b> exactly, analytically and in a fully variational fashion. In contrast, the truncated search direction (TSD) method, of standard use in many electronic structure approaches with localization constraints, relies on the approximation that the truncated search <b>direction</b> <b>vectors</b> of the unconstrained problem resemble the exact search <b>direction</b> <b>vectors</b> of the constrained problem. With the TSD method, {{in order to maintain the}} localization constraints, a part of the pre-calculated information that is stored in the search <b>direction</b> <b>vectors</b> has to be deleted via an ad hoc, non-variational truncation step. The results on an extensive set of test molecules show that, in general, calculations with the VLSD method require less iterations to converge than with the TSD method for any size of the localization region. It was found that in calculations on certain systems where the TSD method is forced to delete a very large amount of information, the VLSD method is capable of achieving convergence in up to three times less iterations. Validation tests show that structural and electronic properties calculated with either method are accurate and in agreement with other electronic structure approaches...|$|R

The Dyson e-transform and the Cauchy{Davenport inequality from additive number theory are used to establish the existence of matchings. 2 1. Introduction and Definitions Let G be a lattice (discrete additive subgroup of R n). Given m lattice points and m <b>direction</b> <b>vectors</b> from G, it is possible to pair the lattice points with the <b>direction</b> <b>vectors</b> so that the sum within each pair is not one of the given lattice points; moreover, this can be done in such a way that the pairing is uniquely determined by the lattice points, <b>direction</b> <b>vectors</b> and multiset of sums [1]. We explore in the present paper the extent to which the above matching property is satised by an arbitrary abelian group G. In what follows, A and B will denote nonempty nite subsets of an additive abelian group G that satisfy jAj = jBj and 0 = 2 B. A bijection : A !
