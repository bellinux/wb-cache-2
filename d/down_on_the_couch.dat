25|$|Several weeks later, {{once again}} in the nursery (as in Act I), the family's {{belongings}} are being packed away as the family prepares to leave the estate forever. Trofimov enters in search of his galoshes, and he and Lopakhin exchange opposing world views. Anya enters and reprimands Lopakhin for ordering his workers to begin chopping down the cherry orchard even while the family is still in the house. Lopakhin apologizes and rushes out to stop them for the time being, in the hopes that he will be somehow reconciled with the leaving family. Charlotta enters, lost and in a daze, and insists that the family find her a new position. Ranevskaya tearfully bids her old life goodbye and leaves as the house is shut up forever. In the darkness, Firs wanders into the room and discovers that they have left without him and boarded him inside the abandoned house to die. He lies <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> and resigns himself to this fate (apparently dying on the spot). Offstage we hear the axes as they cut down the cherry orchard.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July 1980, Vysotsky gave a {{performance}} at a suburban Moscow concert hall. One {{of the stage}} managers recalls that he looked visibly unhealthy ("gray-faced", as she puts it) and complained of not feeling too good, while another says she was surprised by his request for champagne {{before the start of}} the show, as he had always been known for completely abstaining from drink before his concerts. On 16 July Vysotsky gave his last public concert in Kaliningrad. On 18 July, Vysotsky played Hamlet for the last time at the Taganka Theatre. From around 21 July, several of his close friends were on a round-the-clock watch at his apartment, carefully monitoring his alcohol intake and hoping against all odds that his drug dependency would soon be overcome and they would then be able to bring him back from the brink. The effects of drug withdrawal were clearly getting the better of him, as he got increasingly restless, moaned and screamed in pain, and at times fell into memory lapses, failing to recognize at first some of his visitors, including his son Arkadiy. At one point, Vysostsky's personal physician A. Fedotov (the same doctor who had brought him back from clinical death a year earlier in Uzbekistan) attempted to sedate him, inadvertently causing an asphyxiation from which he was barely saved. On 24 July, Vysotsky told his mother that he thought he was going to die that day, and then made similar remarks to a few of the friends present at the apartment, who begged him to stop such talk and keep his spirits up. But soon thereafter, Oksana Afanasyeva saw him clench his chest several times, which led her to suspect that he was genuinely suffering from a cardiovascular condition. She informed Fedotov of this, but was told not to worry, as he was going to monitor Vysotsky's condition all night. In the evening, after drinking relatively small amounts of alcohol, the moaning and groaning Vysotsky was sedated by Fedotov, who then sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> next to him but fell asleep. Fedotov awoke in the early hours of 25 July to an unusual silence, and found Vysotsky dead in his bed with his eyes wide open, apparently of a myocardial infarction, as he later certified. This was contradicted by Fedotov's colleagues, Sklifosovsky Emergency Medical Institute physicians L. Sul'povar and S. Scherbakov (who had demanded the actor's instant hospitalization on 23 July, but were, allegedly, defied by Fedotov), who insisted that Fedotov's incompetent sedation combined with alcohol was what killed Vysotsky. An autopsy was prevented by Vysotsky's parents (who were eager to have their son's drug addiction remain secret), so the true cause of death remains unknown.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Hilson as she comes {{home to her}} {{apartment}} and starts playing [...] "Make Love" [...] on a rough cut CD of In a Perfect World... After taking off her jacket, she sits <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> in the living room. In another room, West is seen getting out of bed. Hilson leaves for the kitchen where she puts out champagne and chocolate-dipped strawberries. She then gets ready in the bathroom while West waits in the bedroom. When Hilson is finished, she joins him in bed and they start cuddling and kissing. The video ends with Hilson looking into the camera over West's shoulder.|$|E

500|$|Grissom {{was born}} as {{an only child}} to a middle-class family in Santa Monica, California. Grissom's father taught botany at a local college and passed his enthusiasm for natural {{sciences}} onto his son. His father died when Grissom was 9 years old. Grissom recalls the day his father died to Catherine Willows in the episode [...] "Still Life", [...] "He came home from school, one hot humid day, laid <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> I was watching TV, my mom brought in some cold drinks, but she couldn't wake him up. No one would tell me why." [...] Consequently, as a young child, Grissom played doctor by performing necropsies on small, deceased animals in the local area.|$|E
500|$|When {{he learns}} that Bob (Tuc Watkins) and Lee (Kevin Rahm) {{are seeing a}} counselor, Tom (Doug Savant) {{suggests}} going to one with Lynette (Felicity Huffman), but she insists therapy is for [...] "losers". Tom starts seeing a therapist {{on his own and}} keeping a [...] "feelings" [...] journal, which he will not let Lynette read. Angrily, she visits the therapist, Dr. Graham (Jane Leeves), to defend herself from what she's sure is Tom's badmouthing. She admits she gets mad when she is not in control. When Dr. Graham equates this to the lack of control Lynette felt in losing her baby, Lynette reluctantly sits <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> Later, when Tom returns from work, Lynette informs him they will be going to therapy together.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sanaa Hamri, who also directed the video for [...] "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)." [...] Both videos were shot back to back, and were released simultaneously to music programs and channels for immediate circulation. The video begins with Carey lying in her bed, as she receives a text message from Snoop Dogg reading [...] "Yo what's happening? What you crying for? Now you know you look 2 damn good 2 be crying... Come here... Holla at a playa DPG style... Ya know," [...] to which Carey responds [...] "I can't sleep." [...] As the video progresses as the lyrics continue, {{it appears to be}} 5 AM, and Carey is still unable to sleep. She lies in bed with the lamp on, pondering on thoughts of a past lover until she takes a bath. Afterwards, she makes her way to the kitchen, and begins pouring an abundant amount of cereal and milk into a bowl, spilling it over the counter in a restless rage. As the scene finishes, Snoop's face is seen on a small monitor, directing his verse to Carey in the video. As the last chorus plays, Carey becomes restless and tosses a champagne glass and bottle at a large window, shattering it and sending glass around the living room. The video ends with Carey lying <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> one more, attempting to sleep once more.|$|E
60|$|She {{rose from}} her place, as if to set the example of departing; but her {{strength}} and resolution both failed her, and she sank <b>down</b> again <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> incapable of making another movement, or uttering another word.|$|R

60|$|At length we lay <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couches</b> to rest, Bastin {{remarking}} that {{he wished}} he could turn off the light, also that he did not in the least regret having tried to kill Oro. Sleep seemed to come to the others quickly, but I could only doze, to wake up from time to time. Of this I was not sorry, since whenever I dropped off dreams seemed to pursue me. For the most part they were of my dead wife. She appeared to be trying to console me for some loss, but the strange thing was that sometimes she spoke with her own voice and sometimes with Yva's, and sometimes looked at me with her own eyes and sometimes with those of Yva. I remember nothing else about these dreams, which were very confused.|$|R
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "You and I" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a slow tempo of 60 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major. During the song Gaga's voice spans from the notes of E3 to C5. The song begins with an A–G–A chord progression, which changes to A–Bm/A–D/A–Bm during the chorus, {{and back to the}} former chords afterwards. The opening lyrics—"It's {{been a long time since}} I came around/ It's been a long time, but I'm back in town/ And this time, I'm not leaving without you"—describe a whiskey-breathed lover for whom she is pining. Gil Kaufman of MTV News described it as the [...] "tune eschewed most of her dance flavor, right down to a rollicking barrel-house piano solo." [...] Her voice sounded like growling during the main verses, where she sings the lines: [...] "He said, 'Sit back down where you belong, in the corner of my bar with your high heels on, Sit back <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> where we made love the first time..." [...] Noting the differences between live performances of the song and the studio version, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph observed that the piano parts were replaced mostly by [...] "fizzing synths, a stomping beat sampled from [...] "We Will Rock You", thundering electric guitars and backing vocals stacked into shimmering choral walls." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian described the song as an [...] "umlaut-toting digital country power ballad" [...] with two Bruce Springsteen references: [...] "born to run" [...] and Nebraska.|$|E

60|$|Ere {{the words}} were finished, {{he put his hand}} to his side, dropped his bridle, and gasped, while a look of intense {{suffering}} passed over his features; and he was passive while his horse was led back to the tent, and he was lifted <b>down</b> and placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> he had just quitted.|$|R

60|$|The young pugilist {{had never}} been daunted by any {{experience}} which had befallen him in the ring. The rough encouragement of his backers, the surge and shouting of the multitude, {{and the sight of}} his opponent had always cheered his stout heart and excited him to prove himself worthy of being the centre of such a scene. But his loneliness and uncertainty were deadly. He flung himself <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> horse-hair <b>couch</b> and tried to doze, but his mind was too restless and excited. Finally he rose, and paced up and down the empty room. Suddenly he was aware of a great rubicund face which surveyed him from round the angle of the door. Its owner, seeing that he was observed, pushed forward into the room.|$|R
6000|$|Presently I missed Yoletta {{from the}} room, and {{desiring}} above {{all things to}} have some word of congratulation from her lips, I went off to seek her.

500|$|On January 28, 1970, a {{third and}} final Band of Gypsys {{appearance}} took place; they performed during a music festival at Madison Square Garden benefiting the anti-Vietnam War Moratorium Committee titled the [...] "Winter Festival for Peace". American blues guitarist Johnny Winter was backstage before the concert; he recalled: [...] " [...] came in with his head <b>down,</b> sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> alone, and put {{his head in his}} hands... He didn't move until {{it was time for the}} show." [...] Minutes after taking the stage he snapped a vulgar response at a woman who had shouted a request for [...] "Foxy Lady". He then began playing [...] "Earth Blues" [...] before telling the audience: [...] "That's what happens when earth fucks with space". Moments later, he briefly sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> drum riser before leaving the stage. Both Miles and Redding later stated that Jeffery had given Hendrix LSD before the performance. Miles believed that Jeffery gave Hendrix the drugs in an effort to sabotage the current band and bring about the return of the original Experience lineup. Jeffery fired Miles after the show and Cox quit, ending the Band of Gypsys.|$|R
