40|$|The {{business}} of music has three major components: production, marketing, and distribution. The major labels {{were able to}} control the music business by controlling these three components through symbiotic relationships between recording studios, music press, retailers, merchandisers, radio stations, and performance venues. This enabled them to lock the three components into a package that was provided to the musicians who signed with them. However, recording artists have become increasingly dissatisfied with the terms enforced by major labels in return for this package, including recording restrictions, retained revenues, ownership and control of the music, and restricted marketing options. While the Internet provides a way for artists to market their music direct to consumers without having to chain themselves to a binding, lengthy, and often inequitable recording contract, <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> {{is not the same thing}} as effective marketing, and independent musicians who move their business online will need to create effective links to consumers they can distribute to. Recording technology placed a distance between performer and listener; however, fans still maintained a connection with the musician as "symbolic links were developed to maintain a sense of commonality between performer and listener, and create a community among fans. " The development of social networking provided a way to restore those links in a more tangible form, and independent musicians are using social networking sites such as MySpace to connect directly with their fan base without the intermediation of a major label...|$|E

The Chi square statistic was significant (Chi square =  66.91; df =  45; p < . 05), while NCP, RMSEA, CFI and IFI showed the same values as for the previous model. In order to test whether the increase of the Chi square was significant, thus rejecting the hypothesis of factor loadings invariance, the baseline Chi square was subtracted from the factor loadings invariance model Chi square, and the same was done with their degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom.</b> The <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> the resulting value is a Chi square <b>distribution</b> with degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> equal to the difference of the degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> the two models.

40|$|Abstract]: Prediction {{distribution}} is {{a basis for}} predictive inferences applied in many real world situations. It is a <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> the unobserved future response(s) conditional {{on a set of}} realized responses from an informative experiment. Various statistical approaches can be used to obtain prediction distributions for different models. This study derives the prediction distribution(s) for multiple linear regression model using the Bayesian method when the error components of both the performed and future models have a multivariate Student-t distribution. The study observes that the prediction <b>distribution(s)</b> <b>of</b> future response(s) has a multivariate Student-t <b>distribution</b> whose degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> depends {{on the size of the}} realized sample and the dimension of the regression parameters’ vector but does not depend on the degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> the errors <b>distribution...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the quantum centipede made of $N$ fermionic quantum walkers on the one-dimensional lattice interacting {{by means of}} the simplest of all hard-bound constraints: the distance between two consecutive fermions is either one or two lattice spacings. This composite quantum walker spreads ballistically, just as the simple quantum walk. However, because of the interactions between the internal degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom,</b> the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> its center-of-mass velocity displays numerous ballistic fronts in the long-time limit, corresponding to singularities in the empirical velocity <b>distribution.</b> The spectrum <b>of</b> the centipede and the corresponding group velocities are analyzed by direct means for the first few values of $N$. Some analytical results are obtained for arbitrary $N$ by exploiting an exact mapping of the problem onto a free-fermion system. We thus derive the maximal velocity describing the ballistic spreading of the two extremal fronts of the centipede wavefunction, including its non-trivial value in the large-$N$ limit.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} how effectively the value at risk (VaR) estimated using the student-t distribution captures the market risk. Design/methodology/approach – Two alternative VaR models, VaR-t and VaR-x models, are presented and {{compared with the}} benchmark model (VaR-n model). In this study, we consider the Student-t distribution as a fit to the empirical distribution for estimating the VaR measure, namely, VaR-t method. Since the Student-t distribution is criticized for its inability to capture the asymmetry <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> asset returns, we use the extreme value theory (EVT) -based model, VaR-x model, {{to take into account}} the asymmetry <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> asset returns. In addition, two different approaches, excess-kurtosis and tail-index techniques, for determining the degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> the Student-t <b>distribution</b> in VaR estimation are introduced. Findings – The main finding of the study is that using the student-t distribution for estimating VaR can improve the VaR estimation and offer accurate VaR estimates, particularly when tail index technique is used to determine the degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> and the confidence level exceeds 98. 5 percent. Originality/value – The main value is to demonstrate in detail how well the student-t distribution behaves in estimating VaR measure for stock market index. Moreover, this study illustrates the easy process for determining the degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> the student-t, which is required in VaR estimation.

This parameter is typically problematic to estimate and a problem in objective Bayesian inference since improper priors lead to improper posteriors, whilst proper priors may dom- inate the data likelihood. We find an objective criterion, based on loss functions, {{instead of trying to}} define objective probabilities directly. Truncating the prior on the degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> is necessary, as the t distribution, above a certain number <b>of</b> degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom,</b> becomes the normal distribution.

40|$|The Bayesian {{approach}} under uniform prior {{is employed}} {{in this paper}} to derive the prediction distribution for multiple regression model with multivariate Student-t error distribution.

This indicates not only the inference robustness with respect to departures from normal error to multivariate Student-t error distributions, but also indicates that the Bayesian approach with uniform prior is competitive with other statistical methods in the derivation <b>of</b> prediction <b>distribution...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of detecting a random spatially distributed signal source by an array of sensors. We start with an approximate likelihood ratio (LR) detector and analyze its performance. Using the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) approach, we then derive detectors under several assumptions on the available statistics. The performance of these detectors is evaluated, {{and the effect of}} the angular spread of the source is investigated. The detection performance behaves differently under different scenarios. We notice that the degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> (DOF) <b>of</b> the <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> the detection statistics depend on both the signal angular spread and the number of data snapshots. Specifically, at a high SNR level and with small degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom,</b> an increase <b>of</b> angular spread improves the detection performance. However, with large degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom,</b> the increase <b>of</b> angular spread reduces detection performance. We provide a detailed discussion of the behavior of detection performance under various conditions. A comparison between the GLR detectors and conventional beamformer detectors is made by computer simulations. The results indicate that the GLR detectors perform better as the angular spread becomes large than that of the conventional beamformer detectors.

40|$|The {{case of the}} {{classical}} Hill problem is numerically investigated by performing a thorough and systematic classification of the initial conditions of the orbits. More precisely, the initial conditions of the orbits are classified into four categories: (i) non-escaping regular orbits; (ii) trapped chaotic orbits; (iii) escaping orbits; and (iv) collision orbits. In order to obtain a more general and complete view of the orbital structure of the dynamical system our exploration takes place in both planar (2 D) and the spatial (3 D) version of the Hill problem. For the 2 D system we numerically integrate large sets of initial conditions in several types of planes, while for the system with three degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom,</b> three-dimensional <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> initial conditions of orbits are examined. For distinguishing between ordered and chaotic bounded motion the Smaller ALingment Index (SALI) method is used. We managed to locate the several bounded basins, {{as well as the}} basins of escape and collision and also to relate them with the corresponding escape and collision time of the orbits. Our numerical calculations indicate that the overall orbital dynamics of the Hamiltonian system is a complicated but highly interested problem. We hope our contribution to be useful for a further understanding of the orbital properties of {{the classical}} Hill problem. Comment: Published in Nonlinear Dynamics (NODY) journa...|$|R

This article invites philosophers to help identify ethical and effective responses to medical brain drain. It reviews existing proposals and their limitations. It makes a case that, in resource-poor countries, ‘locally relevant medical training’—teaching primarily locally endemic diseases and practice in scarcity conditions, training in rural communities and admitting rural students preferentially—could help improve retention. Locally relevant training would arguably diminish medical brain drain in five ways. It would (i) make graduates less attractive for Western employers, (ii) align graduates’ expectations with actual practice, diminishing ‘burn-out’, (iii) enhance the professional prestige of local practice, (iv) hold rotations in, and recruit applicants from, rural areas, which is known to improve retention there, and (v) create local career development options that attract practitioners to stay.
