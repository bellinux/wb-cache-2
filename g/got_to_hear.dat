25|$|Throughout 1916 morale in {{the factory}} went slowly downhill, but nothing was done to {{alleviate}} the problem, although consultations were going on between Whitehall and Birtley {{on how best to}} deal with any unrest that night occur {{in the factory}}. Another problem was that in practice the Colony was policed by Belgian gendarmes but in theory they were working under British rule of law, very different from their own. As just one example, back home the gendarmes were allowed to carry pistols at all times: here they were not allowed to be armed except under special circumstances and only then with the approval of the British police. Finally, on 20 December 1916, it all came to a head. One of the workers went to see Captain Algrain, Military Head of Security, in order to obtain four days leave, to which he was entitled to. Suddenly the captain noticed that the man, though wearing his regulation uniform, was sporting a civilian cap. Enraged at this ‘breach of discipline’, he had the man sent directly to the cells for four days, to join two others who had attempted to leave the camp in civvies. The rest of the workforce quickly <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> about this unjust act.|$|E
500|$|Björk was {{intending}} to have several producers {{work on the}} album, but this idea never came to fruition. Björk was then {{going to have the}} album produced with Paul Fox until she was introduced to producer Nellee Hooper by her boyfriend Dominic Thrupp. Hooper had previously produced albums by Soul II Soul, Sinéad O'Connor and Massive Attack, which made Björk skeptical about working with him, stating that [...] "I thought Nellee was too 'good taste' for my liking. But then I met him, got to know him, [...] <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> about his fabulous ideas..." [...] Björk and Hooper's recording ideas were very similar, which led to the decision to end production work with Massey and Fox. Hooper introduced Björk to studio technology and studio programmer Marius de Vries who gave Debut a modern style with the use of keyboards and synthesizers. Hooper produced the first ten tracks on the album, while Björk co-produced [...] "Like Someone in Love" [...] with Hooper and produced [...] "The Anchor Song" [...] solely herself. Björk and Hooper spent many sessions in the studio working on Debut until the album was finished in early 1993.|$|E

500|$|Blackhill Enterprises {{provided}} a [...] high stage, with the speakers being {{housed in a}} thirty-foot-high tower so that people {{at the far end}} of the park would be able to hear the music. The stage was flanked by palm trees in pots and behind the performers there was a blowup of the cover of the Beggars Banquet album. Richards had started experimenting with open tunings by this point in the band's career, particularly after hearing Ry Cooder, and the Hyde Park gig was the first chance audiences <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> them. He played a Gibson ES-330 tuned to open E tuning with a capo on the fourth fret, and a Gibson Flying V. Taylor, meanwhile, played a Gibson Les Paul for the opening number, followed by an SG for the majority of the set. The PA system was supplied by Watkins Electric Music, who already handled amplification at previous Hyde Park shows. Company founder Charlie Watkins recalls it was the largest PA he had assembled to that point and, unable to provide enough gear himself, he was forced to borrow extras from other groups, later saying, [...] "I didn't have many columns, but I wanted to put 1500W up. I borrowed some from T-Rex. They all chipped in — that's what we used to do." ...|$|E

Skaat said, [...] "this song touches me deeply.

He wanted me to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest for five years, and then he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that I was going {{to take part in the}} national selection before he passed away." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September, Chicane {{produced}} a remix {{of the classic}} track [...] "Relax (Don't Do It)" [...] by Frankie Goes To Hollywood, {{which is part of}} the 25-year anniversary of the seminal track. It was learned that the Re-Work EP was cancelled although no official announcement was ever made in regards to this. Other 'reworked' tracks that were due to appear on the EP were never mentioned from the initial announcement. Recently stated from Chicane Management; there were actually quite a few that people never <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> In a June 2010 interview with Impact Magazine, Bracegirdle commented on the 'Re-work Ep' issue. [...] "We covered House Arrest and there's a massive bag of legal problems with that record. God knows why. Poppiholla became this complete and utter monster... The best laid plans of mice and men can go completely astray once you have a big record. Things change all the time... the plan was to (release Re-worked) and then the whole thing went completely mental... in a good way." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{retrospective}} {{reviews for}} the game's Virtual Console release, critics praised Nintendo {{for making the}} moves to re-release Sin and Punishment and finally localize it for western audiences. Frank Provo of GameSpot found the release to be a bargain, seeing as the original Nintendo 64 cartridges were uncommon and approaching $100 USD in price on the used game market. Even though the original game was built around the Nintendo 64 controller, critics still found the GameCube controller worked well as a substitute. Critics shared the shared sentiments of reviews {{at the time in}} regard to the game's intense and furious action, stylish graphics, and smooth frame rate, while again also criticizing its short length. Concluding their thoughts, Adam Riley of Cubed3 called Sin and Punishment a [...] "cult legend", Damien McFerran of Nintendo Life believed it to be the pinnacle of the Nintendo 64 library, and Lucas M. Thomas of IGN called it a [...] "Nintendo 64 masterpiece" [...] and the perfect hardware swan song the west never <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b>|$|E

Mathew grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed Grover, who died on the spot.|$|R
