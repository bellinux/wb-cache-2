40|$|The {{ab initio}} {{calculations}} about {{the properties of}} the <b>interstitials</b> doping in the rutile TiO 2 and their impact on the transport coefficients are reported. As the doping of the Zr or Ti <b>interstitials</b> in the TiO 2, the lattice Ti 4 + ions acquire the excess electrons so reduced to the Ti 3 + or Ti 2 + ions. However, the Cu <b>interstitials</b> could not lose enough electrons to reduce the lattice Ti 4 + ions. Furthermore, the Ti or Cu <b>interstitials</b> in the ZrO 2 also are unable to promote the lattice Zr 4 + ions to form the lattice Zr 3 + or Zr 2 + ions. The high transport coefficients are observed in the defected TiO 2 with the Ti or Zr <b>interstitials</b> as the high concentration of the Ti 3 + or Ti 2 + ions. So, the Zr <b>interstitials</b> are the favorable choice for the extra-doping to improve the transport properties in the TiO 2 -based resistive random access memory...|$|R
30|$|We {{report a}} unique growth and {{migration}} behavior of Ge nanocrystallites {{mediated by the}} presence of Si <b>interstitials</b> under thermal annealing at 900 °C within an H 2 O ambient. The Ge nanocrystallites were previously generated by the selective oxidation of SiGe nanopillars and appeared to be very sensitive to the presence of Si <b>interstitials</b> that come either from adjacent Si 3 N 4 layers or from within the oxidized nanopillars. A cooperative mechanism is proposed, wherein the Si <b>interstitials</b> aid in both the migration and coarsening of these Ge nanocrystallites through Ostwald ripening, while the Ge nanocrystallites, in turn, appear to enhance the generation of Si <b>interstitials</b> through catalytic decomposition of the Si-bearing layers.|$|R

5|$|CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from fenestrated capillaries in the choroid plexus into an <b>interstitial</b> space, with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the <b>interstitial</b> fluid. This fluid then needs {{to pass through the}} epithelium cells lining the choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water into the CSF by creating osmotic pressure. Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into the CSF.|$|E

40|$|Stability {{of oxygen}} point defects in Ruddlesden–Popper oxides (La[subscript 1 –x]Sr[subscript x]) [subscript 2]MO[subscript 4 ±δ](M = Co, Ni, Cu) is studied with density {{functional}} theory calculations {{to determine their}} stable sites, charge states, and energetics as functions of Sr content (x), transition metal (M), and defect concentration (δ). We demonstrate that the dominant O point defects can change between oxide <b>interstitials,</b> peroxide <b>interstitials,</b> and vacancies. In general, increasing x and atomic number of M stabilizes peroxide over oxide <b>interstitials</b> as well as vacancies over both peroxide and oxide interstitials; increasing δ destabilizes both oxide <b>interstitials</b> and vacancies but barely affects peroxide <b>interstitials.</b> We also demonstrate that the O 2 p-band center is a powerful descriptor for these materials and correlates linearly with {{the formation energy of}} all defects. The trends of formation energy versus x, M, and δ and the correlation with O 2 p-band center are explained in terms of oxidation chemistry and electronic structure. United States.

3000|$|The above TEM {{observations}} clearly {{reveal that}} the growth and migration behaviors of Ge nanocrystallites {{are very sensitive to}} the presence and the content of Si <b>interstitials</b> that are provided either externally by adjacent Si 3 N 4 layers or by small concentrations of residual Si <b>interstitials</b> remaining within the oxidized poly-SiGe pillars. The role of Si <b>interstitials</b> in the growth of Ge nanocrystallites under thermal annealing in an oxidizing ambient is sketched in Figures  2 d, 3 d, and 4 c. Although a large body of work exists in the literature on the generation and role of Si <b>interstitials,</b> to our knowledge, the above phenomenon has never been reported before. Previous work has attributed the thermal oxidation of Si inducing a drastic lateral expansion of the silicon lattice [12] and the generation of silicon self-interstitials as a means of partially relieving the compressive stress in the growing oxide layer that develops {{as a result of a}} 2.25 × volume expansion when Si is converted to SiO 2. The majority of these Si <b>interstitials</b> generated during Si oxidation diffuse into the growing oxide layer and are also oxidized [13, 14], while a relatively small, but significant, amount of <b>interstitials</b> diffuse into the Si substrate, causing supersaturation of these <b>interstitials</b> and the consequent precipitation as oxidation stacking faults (OSFs) [5, 6] or oxidation-enhanced diffusion (OED) [1, 2] of some dopants.

30|$|In conclusion, we have {{observed}} a unique {{phenomenon of the}} migration and growth of Ge nanocrystallite clusters within SiO 2 layers that is {{made possible by the}} presence of Si <b>interstitials</b> during high-temperature thermal annealing in an oxidizing ambient. The Ge nanocrystallites generated by selective oxidation of SiGe appear to be very sensitive to the presence of Si <b>interstitials</b> that are provided either by adjacent Si 3 N 4 layers or by residual Si <b>interstitials</b> left behind after thermal oxidation of the SiGe. The Si <b>interstitials</b> also facilitate the Ostwald ripening of the Ge nanocrystallites. We have proposed a novel cooperative mechanism for this Si interstitial-mediated growth and migration of Ge nanocrystallites under thermal oxidation. We envisage further scientific exploration of this unique phenomenon and the demonstration of new device geometries with Ge QDs buried within various Si-containing layers.|$|R
