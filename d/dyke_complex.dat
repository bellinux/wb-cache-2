40|$|Bibliography: pages 106 - 110. The Gannakouriep {{dyke swarm}} {{comprises}} a linear swarm of north to northeast striking mafic dykes emplaced during late Proterozoic rifting in the Gariep belt. The swarm has a strike length of over 300 km crossing terrane {{boundaries of the}} Gordonia sub-province, Richtersveld igneous sub-province and 8 ushmanland sub-province of the Namaqua Mobile Province. The main axis of dyke intrusion is centred within the 2. 0 Ga Richtersveld igneous sub-province where the density of dyking increases westwards across strike towards the Gariep belt, prior to disappearing within the sediment/basement contact of the para-autochthonous Port Nolloth Assemblage. An internal Rb-Sr mineral isochron, together with pyroxene K-Ar plateau and whole rock model TCHUR ages, indicate that the dyke swarm was intruded around 720 Ma. The majority of the dykes comprise subophitic relict gabbros and dolerites of alkali affinities replaced by metamorphic minerals of both greenschist and amphibolite facies. The greenstones are encountered within the NE striking eastern sector of the dyke swarm which records the original tensile stress field, whilst amphibolites are encountered in the northerly striking western sector of the swarm which has been rotated 26 ° anticlockwise during Pan-African (500 - 550 Ma) deformation in the Gariep belt. The latter age of regional metamorphism and deformation is supported by available K-Ar age data on whole rock samples and amphibole mineral separates. Integrated field relationships, continuum mechanics modelling and geochemical {{studies suggest that the}} swarm was initiated as a series of low level crustal magma chambers which subsequently gave rise to a series of <b>dyke</b> <b>complexes</b> that comprise the Gannakouriep dyke swarm. The geochemical variability between individual <b>dyke</b> <b>complexes</b> across the entire swarm is negligible; only slight differences being recorded by their high-field-strength element concentrations. The latter suggests that all dykes are genetically linked to a single mantle diapir, with only slight source characteristic heterogeneities. All dykes are ferro-tholeiites with no primitive (picritic) member being present. Geochemical trends recorded by the swarm are easily reconcilable in terms of fractionation of the phenocryst assemblage olivine, plagioclase, clinopyroxene, (ilmenite and Ti-magnetite). However an earlier phase of fractionation of essentially olivine and plagioclase {{at the base of the}} crust is suggested since constraints on the degree of partial melting (3 - 6 %) imposed by REE patterns would derive an alkali basalt parental melt. The geodynamic relationship between the Gannakouriep dyke swarm and rifting in the Gariep belt is accounted for by a lithospheric plate model containing non-coincidental crustal and mantle weaknesses represented by late Namaquan D 4 n extensional faults and a mantle weakness possibly resulting from crustal thickening within the Richtersveld igneous sub-province during Namaquan tectonics...|$|R

These ophiolites are highly dismembered, and sections of the lowermost crust and upper mantle are not present. New data on the field occurrence, petrology, and geochemistry of the plutonic, subvolcanic, and volcanic ophiolitic units are presented. The plutonic rocks consist of both layered and isotropic gabbros, as well as subordinate Fe-gabbros, and quartz-diorites. Ultramafic cumulates are very scarce, and include plagioclase-dunites and plagioclase-wehrlites.

40|$|The Younger Giant <b>Dyke</b> <b>Complex</b> {{consists}} {{of a set of}} massive coalescing dykes of Proterozoic age (c. 1170 Ma), resulting from intrusion of a suite of transitional olivine basaltic/hawaiitic magmas in a continental rift setting. The suite, compositionally related by low pressure (< 10 kb) olivine-plagioclase fractionation, is believed to have had a deeper level evolution dominated by pyroxene and possibly garnet fractionation. Slow cooling in situ of the interior parts of the <b>dyke</b> <b>complex</b> produced cumulitic suites. Those exposed range from gabbroic to syenitic; residual bodies of riebeckite granite and, very subordinate, feldspathoidal syenite were also generated. The basic magmas had notably low/O 2 values, leading to delayed magnetite and clinopyroxene precipitation, relatively iron-rich differentiates and some residual liquids of pantelleritic composition. The basic magmas had high F/Cl values and are inferred to have had low H 2 O contents.

The Pito Deep sheeted <b>dyke</b> <b>complex</b> has a similar composition to the sheeted dykes drilled at ODP Hole 504 B suggesting that the measured compositions are representative of sheeted dyke complexes at intermediate- to fast-spreading ridges. The dykes show only small increases in ? 34 S which, combined with the rock dominated d 34 S of vent fluids, requires the majority of seawater sulphate to be precipitated as anhydrite before the fluid reacts with the sheeted <b>dyke</b> <b>complex.</b> This loss of sulphate from the fluid means that a much higher Fe 2 O 3 in the sheeted <b>dyke</b> <b>complex</b> than in fresh MORB glasses cannot be explained by oxidation due to seawater sulphate reduction during fluid-rock reaction.

40|$|International audienceOceanic {{accretion}} {{is thought}} to be the process of oceanic crust (and lithosphere) edification through adiabatic melting of shallow convecting mantle at oceanic spreading ridges. It is usually considered as a post-breakup diagnostic process following continents rupturing. However, this is not always correct. The structure of volcanic passive margins (representing more than 50 % of passive continental margins) outlines that the continental lithosphere is progressively changed into oceanic-type lithosphere during the stage of continental extension. This is clear at least, at crustal level. The continental crust is 'changed' from the earliest stages of extension into a typical -however thicker- oceanic crust with the typical oceanic magmatic layers (from top to bottom: lava flows/tuffs, sheeted <b>dyke</b> <b>complexes,</b> dominantly (sill-like) mafic intrusions in the lower crust). The Q-rich continental crust is highly extended and increases in volume (due to the magma) during the extensional process. At the continent-ocean transition there is, finally, no seismic difference between this highly transformed continental crust and the oceanic crust. Using a large range of data (including deep seismic reflection profiles), we discuss the mantle mechanisms that governs the process of mantle-assisted continental extension. We outline the large similarity between those mantle processes and those acting at purely-oceanic spreading axis and discuss the effects of the inherited continental lithosphere in the pattern of new mafic crust edification...|$|R

At the same time, primitive lavas continued to erupt from <b>dyke</b> <b>complexes</b> in the rift zones, while intermediate lavas effused in the geographical transition from rift zone to central complex. To constrain the magmatic processes, {{that gave rise}} to the observed temporal and spatial patterns, several types of geochemical analyses of these rocks were applied and results embedded into a detailed, pre-existing framework of radiometric ages and whole-rock data. A case study of the composite lava flow of Montana Reventada allowed to investigate magma mixing as one potential mechanism to generate intermediate magma on Tenerife. The two end-members were a basanite and a phonolite, which erupted one after another, the basanite before the phonolite. The phonolite carries a considerable amount of mafic enclaves. Based on field evidence, the magma mixing event was constrained to a short interval before the eruption. A detailed geochemical dataset was used to confirm the mixed nature of the inclusions and to determine mixing ratios. Not all elements and oxides could be modelled, which is explained by observed crystal exchange between basanite and phonolite and by interdiffusion of trace elements between enclaves and phonolite. It thus appears that intermediate magma may form by magma mixing on Tenerife...|$|R

Using the Oman ophiolite as an analogue for crust formed at a fast-spreading ridge, we investigate the composition of magmas delivered to the AMC using the compositions and textures of samples from the uppermost plutonics immediately below the sheeted <b>dyke</b> <b>complex.</b> The cores of clinopyroxene crystals are commonly as primitive as those found in deeper parts of the crust. This is true for major (Mg#), compatible trace (Cr) and incompatible trace (REEs) elements. Plagioclase crystal size distributions are ln-linear at all but the smallest crystal sizes suggesting a single crystal population. This indicates that the primitive crystal compositions are not carried to the AMC as xenocrysts formed deeper in the crust. Instead, these data demonstrate that primitive magmas that have previously undergone little or no differentiation can be delivered to the AMC. This supports models in which crystal subsidence from this body {{plays an important role in}} the accretion of the lower crust...|$|E
40|$|Formation of new {{subduction}} zones {{represents one}} of the cornerstones of plate tectonics, yet both the kinematics and geodynamics governing this process remain enigmatic. A major subduction initiation event occurred in the Late Cretaceous, within the Neo-Tethys Ocean between Gondwana and Eurasia. Suprasubduction zone ophiolites (i. e., emerged fragments of ancient oceanic lithosphere formed at suprasubduction spreading centers) were generated during this subduction event and are today distributed in the eastern Mediterranean region along three ~E-W trending ophiolitic belts. Several models have been proposed to explain the formation of these ophiolites and the evolution of the associated intra-Neo-Tethyan subduction zone. Here we present new paleospreading directions from six Upper Cretaceous ophiolites of Turkey, Cyprus, and Syria, calculated by using new and published paleomagnetic data from sheeted <b>dyke</b> <b>complexes.</b> Our results show that ~NNE-SSW subduction zones were formed within the Neo-Tethys during the Late Cretaceous, which we propose were part of a major step-shaped subduction system composed of ~NNE-SSW and ~WNW-ESE segments. We infer that this subduction system developed within old (Triassic?) lithosphere, along fracture zones and perpendicular weakness zones, since the Neo-Tethyan spreading ridge formed during Gondwana fragmentation would have already been subducted at the Pontides subduction zone by the Late Cretaceous. Our new results provide an alternative kinematic model of Cretaceous Neo-Tethyan subduction initiation and call for future research on the mechanisms of subduction inception within old (and cold) lithosphere and the formation of metamorphic soles below suprasubduction zone ophiolites in the absence of nearby spreading ridges...|$|R

The basaltic rocks of this complex consist of both mantle and crustal suites and include pegmatitic and isotropic gabbros, gabbroic-dibasic <b>dykes,</b> <b>dyke</b> swarm <b>complex</b> and pillow lavas. The chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) patterns of most of these rocks show LREE depletion and the primary mantle-normalized incompatible elements indicate depletion in HFSEs (Nb, Ta) and enrichment in LILEs. The rocks show characters of island arc tholeiite/mid-ocean ridge basalt magma types. Whole rock chemistry of the rocks shows that they are originated in an oceanic back arc basin, and subsequently have been enriched by slab-derived fluids. Abundances of HFSE and HREE {{in most of the}} basaltic samples, suggest a slow subduction rate. Opening of Nain-Baft Ocean, which was probably a marginal basin, occurred during Lower Jurassic. After generation of an inter-oceanic island arc in the Nain-Baft Ocean during the Late Jurassic, a second rifting phase started within the inter-ocean island arc during Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian-Senonian). The inter-ocean island arc was developed and formed an oceanic back arc basin, the site of generation of most of the Nain ophiolitic rocks. The Nain-Baft Ocean finally closed in Maastrichtian.

The sulfide minerals occur both as inclusions in chromite and as interstitial grains. The sulfides host much of the Pd and Rh. The IPGE and Rh correlate with Cr but notwith S or Se, indicating that these elements were not collected by a sulfide liquid. Palladium, Cu, and Se correlate with each other, but not with S. The low S/Se (< 1500) of the whole rock and magnetite rims around the sulfides indicate some S has been lost from the rocks. We conclude that to account for all observations, the IPGE and Rh were originally collected by chromite, and subsequently, small quantities of base metal sulfide liquid was added to the chromite layers from the overlying magma. The IPGE and Rh in the chromite diffused from the chromite into the base metal sulfides and converted some of the sulfides to laurite...|$|R

These granitoids {{take place on the}} collision belts of the subduction zone formed by the N-S directed compressional forces of late Cretaceous started in Lower Cretaceous and increased after Neocomian. Their development is due to the increasing crustal thickness and sinking of the island arc deposits and its basement which is oceanic crust during Coniacian-Upper Santonian. Granitoids are the differentiated products of anatectic magma (diorite, monzonite, syenite, tonalite, granodiorite, granite, alcaline granite and silexite).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of the magmatic processes that operated in the plumbing system of the Franklin Large Igneous Province (LIP). The Franklin LIP (723 - 716 Ma) extends > 2500 km across northern Canada and is superbly exposed in the Minto Inlier of Victoria Island. The exposed plumbing system is dominated by sills, with subordinate fault-guided feeder dykes. Locally, sills are characterised by olivine-enriched bases, with overlying doleritic gabbros. One example is the Lower Pyramid Sill. This sill was investigated in detail using petrography, whole-rock chemistry and in-situ mineral chemistry. Petrological and geochemical observations, combined with inverse melt modelling show that the olivine-enriched layer formed by olivine slurry replenishment into a resident gabbroic mush. In contrast, the overlying gabbros formed by in-situ differentiation. Intervening clinopyroxene-rich cumulates formed by a metasomatic reaction between different pore melts. The study emphasises that both slurry emplacement and in-situ differentiation {{played a role in the}} formation of cumulate layering in this sill. Sections examined through the same sill along strike, collectively termed the Fort Collinson Sill Complex, reveal that the olivine slurry propagated > 50 km downstream. Radiogenic and stable isotope data support this interpretation. The geochemical consequences of cumulate remobilisation and mixing in the sill complex are demonstrated, as well as quantified, using Fe=Mg modelling. Additionally, the effects of dolostone assimilation are considered, which can potentially affect phase equilibria.

In the field the rocks were examined in detail and a geological map of the area constructed. The contant relationships {{of the members of}} the OlderGranites are described and results of detailed petrographical examination given. In particular, a study has been made of the microstructures, including perthite and myrmekite; from various considerations the microstructure appear to indicate a metasomatic origin for large microcline crystals found in these rocks. Various lines of evidence for and against both magmatic and metasomatic origins for the Bauchi rocks are examined; the equivocal nature of much of this evidence is stressed. The weight of petrographic and field evidence, backed by the plutonic setting and spatial distribution of the different rocks, is thought to indicate a metasomatic origin for the migmatites, the Biotite Granite and the Biotite Hornblende Granite. The Quartz Diorite and the Fayalite Quartz Monzonite are demonstrated to be related the Charnockite series; they originated by a soaking of the Biotite Granite and the Biotite Hornblende Granite respectively with dilute basic magma or solutions under deep seated conditions. It is suggested that the basic solution could have originated from the basic material displaced in the zones of granite and migmatites. The petrology of the Bauchi rocks is considered in the light of problems relating to granites and charnockites in general. The account includes ten chemical analyses of' rocks from the Bauchi area, as well as optical data on the minerals and numerous modal analyses...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{organization of}} a giant mafic dyke swarm, the Okavango complex, in the northern Karoo Large Igneous Province (LIP) of NE Botswana is detailed. This N 110 °E-oriented dyke swarm extends for 1500 km with a maximum width of 100 km through Archaean basement terranes and Permo-Jurassic sedimentary sequences. The cornerstone {{of the study is}} the quantitative analysis of N> 170 (exposed) and N> 420 (detected by ground magnetics) dykes evidenced on a ca. 80 -km-long section lying in crystalline host-rocks, at high-angle to the densest zone of the swarm (Shashe area). Individual dykes are generally sub-vertical and parallel to the entire swarm. Statistical analysis of width data indicates anomalous dyke frequency (few data < 5. 0 m) and mean dyke thickness (high value of 17 m) with respect to values classically obtained from other giant swarms. Variations of mean dyke thicknesses from 17 (N 110 °E swarm) to 27 m (adjoining and coeval N 70 °E giant swarm) are assigned to the conditions hosting fracture networks dilated as either shear or pure extensional structures, respectively, in response to an inferred NNW–SSE extension. Both fracture patterns are regarded as inherited brittle basement fabrics associated with a previous (Proterozoic) dyking event. The Okavango N 110 °E dyke swarm is thus a polyphase intrusive system in which total dilation caused by Karoo dykes (estimated frequency of 87 %) is 12. 2 % (6315 m of cumulative dyke width) throughout the 52 -km-long projected Shashe section. Assuming that Karoo mafic dyke swarms in NE Botswana follow inherited Proterozoic fractures, as similarly applied for most of the nearly synchronous giant <b>dyke</b> <b>complexes</b> converging towards the Nuanetsi area, leads us to consider that the resulting triple junction-like dyke/fracture pattern is not a definitive proof for a deep mantle plume in the Karoo LIP...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{combine a}} geological, geochemical and tectonic dataset from 118 {{ophiolite}} complexes {{of the major}} global Phanerozoic orogenic belts with similar datasets of ophiolites from 111 Precambrian greenstone belts to construct an overview of oceanic crust generation over 4 billion years. Geochemical discrimination systematics built on immobile trace elements reveal that the basaltic units of the Phanerozoic ophiolites are dominantly subduction-related (75 %), linked to backarc processes and characterized by a strong MORB component, similar to ophiolites in Precambrian greenstone sequences (85 %). The remaining 25 % Phanerozoic subduction-unrelated ophiolites are mainly (74 %) of Mid-Ocean-Ridge type (MORB type), {{in contrast to the}} equal proportion of Rift/Continental Margin, Plume, and MORB type ophiolites in the Precambrian greenstone belts. Throughout the Phanerozoic there are large geochemical variations in major and trace elements, but for average element values calculated in 5 bins of 100 million year intervals there are no obvious secular trends. By contrast, basaltic units in the ophiolites of the Precambrian greenstones (calculated in 12 bins of 250 million years intervals), starting in late Paleo- to early Mesoproterozoic (ca. 2. 0 – 1. 8  Ga), exhibit an apparent decrease in the average values of incompatible elements such as Ti, P, Zr, Y and Nb, and an increase in the compatible elements Ni and Cr with deeper time {{to the end of the}} Archean and into the Hadean. These changes can be attributed to decreasing degrees of partial melting of the upper mantle from Hadean/Archean to Present. The onset of geochemical changes coincide with the timing of detectible changes in the structural architecture of the ophiolites such as greater volumes of gabbro and more common sheeted <b>dyke</b> <b>complexes,</b> and lesser occurrences of ocelli (varioles) in the pillow lavas in ophiolites younger than 2  Ga. The global data from the Precambrian ophiolites, representative of nearly 50 % of all known worldwide greenstone belts provide significant clues for the operation of plate tectonic processes in the Archean...|$|R
40|$|The ophiolites from Bosnia are {{products}} of the Jurassic spreading of the Neo-Tethys, and are fragments of a long chain of ophiolites of the same origin. Their geological characteristics are {{the absence of a}} sheeted <b>dyke</b> <b>complex</b> and the tectonic disruption of the cumulate sequence. Upper crust volcanics as well as lower crust cumulates show low metamorphic changes of the prehnite/laumontite type, except for some marginal localities of large ophiolite massifs (Visegrad, Konjuh, Krivaja, Ozren) in which the metamorphic grade reaches the amphibolite facies. The characteristic features of these ophiolites are as follows: The mantle rocks are lherzolites and harzburgites, both characterized by a negative Eu-anomaly and a few of them have a negative Ce anomaly, which is explained as alteration due to contact with sea water. The cumulate rocks are gabbroic to ultramafic. Numerous amphibolites reveal a chemical character of cumulus rocks. Early crystallization of plagioclase in the magma chamber caused positive Eu anomalies in these rocks. The upper crust rocks are basalts, diabases and gabbros. Most of them reveal REE patterns which are typical for basalts from constructive plate margins. A few of them which have a slight enrichment of LREE are explained as the partial melt products of a mantle less depleted than the one which produced the majority of basalts. Chemical discrimination diagrams show that the magmatic rocks are of the mid-oceanic ridge type, i. e. that they formed at the spreading of oceanic plates without any influence from a subducted slab. A comparison with recent spreading zones shows that ophiolites of the described type (absence of a sheeted <b>dyke</b> <b>complex,</b> areas of tectonic disruption in the upper and lower crust, local amphibolitisation and eruptions of “enriched” MORB) probably have formed in areas of the intersection of spreading and a transform fault. In most of their characteristics the ophiolites from Bosnia show a close similarity to the Ligurian ophiolites which obducted in about the same period of time and which are also products of the spreading of Neo-Tethys...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the rock units of the Slieve Gullion ring <b>dyke</b> <b>complex,</b> to determine their composition, structure and position within the stratigraphic sequence; as well as producing a model for the emplacement of these units. A combination of detailed field observations, mapping, rock sample collection and structural measurements were obtained at selected field sites around the ring <b>dyke</b> <b>complex.</b> In the laboratory, the rock samples obtained were prepared for thin section and geochemical analysis. When compared to previously published geochemical data, the results found here were generally in agreement. The geochemistry results obtained for the various rock units studied were also generally within the expected igneous rock categories on the IUGS classification graph. There are some exceptions to this however and it is suggested here that those rocks have undergone hydrothermal secondary alteration, which is supported by the presence of infilled fractures within the outcrops and evidence for the presence of hot fluids (tuffisites). The geochemistry data plots all of the rocks studied here (apart from the basalts) within the alkaline or high-k calc-alkaline series on the tectonic environment graph of Ewart (1982). This suggests a cratonic or continental rift environment which supports that this igneous complex is related to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. The geochemistry results and observations of the thin sections for the rafts of basalt found within the Forkill Quarry both confirm that these outcrops are basalts. It was also found that the basalts were geochemically similar to the Antrim basalts and it is therefore suggested here that the Forkill Quarry basalts predate the formation of the ring dyke. Overall this research agrees with the traditional ring dyke emplacement model as proposed by Emeleus et al. (2012) due to the presence of multiple sharp contacts between the rock units as well as evidence of crushing and the presence of percolating hot fluids near to rock contacts...|$|E
40|$|The role of source {{rocks in}} the {{formation}} of Cyprus-type Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposits is not fully understood. In this paper we suggest that the formation of epidosites – episode + quartz ± chlorite ± titanite rocks commonly found at the base of ophiolitic sheeted dyke complexes – has the potential to release cobalt and zinc into active hydrothermal ore forming systems. New geochemical and mineralogical data from the sheeted <b>dyke</b> <b>complex</b> of the Troodos ophiolite indicates that progressive alteration of greenschist facies altered metabasalts to end-member epidosites results in decreasing base metal concentrations (Zn, Co) in individual dyke units. We believe this relationship provides the clearest evidence that epidosites act as source rocks for VMS deposits, and, moreover, the process of epidositisation provides a method of mobilizing metals such as Co and Ni that are considered generally immobile under typical greenschist grade alteration...|$|E
40|$|The Zagros fold-and-thrust belt of SW Iran {{is a young}} {{continental}} convergence zone, extending NW–SE {{from eastern}} Turkey through northern Iraq {{and the length of}} Iran to the Strait of Hormuz and into northern Oman. This belt reflects the shortening and off-scraping of thick sediments from the northern margin of the Arabian platform, essentially behaving as the accretionary prism for the Iranian convergent margin. Distribution of Upper Cretaceous ophiolites in the Zagros orogenic belt defines the northern limit of the evolving suture between Arabia and Eurasia and comprises two parallel belts: (1) Outer Zagros Ophiolitic Belt (OB) and (2) Inner Zagros Ophiolitic Belt (IB). These belts contain complete (if disrupted) ophiolites with well-preserved mantle and crustal sequences. Mantle sequences include tectonized harzburgite and rare ultramafic–mafic cumulates as well as isotropic gabbro lenses and isolated dykes within the harzburgite. Crustal sequences include rare gabbros (mostly in IB ophiolites), sheeted <b>dyke</b> <b>complexes,</b> pillowed lavas and felsic rocks. All Zagros ophiolites are overlain by Upper Cretaceous pelagic limestone. Limited radiometric dating indicates that the OB and IB formed at the same time during Late Cretaceous time. IB and OB components show strong suprasubduction zone affinities, from mantle harzburgite to lavas. This is shown by low whole-rock Al₂O₃ and CaO contents and spinel and orthopyroxene compositions of mantle peridotites {{as well as by the}} abundance of felsic rocks and the trace element characteristics of the lavas. Similarly ages, suprasubduction zone affinities and fore-arc setting suggest that the IB and OB once defined a single tract of fore-arc lithosphere that was disrupted by exhumation of subducted Sanandaj–Sirjan Zone metamorphic rocks. Our data for the OB and IB along with better-studied ophiolites in Cyprus, Turkey and Oman compel the conclusion that a broad and continuous tract of fore-arc lithosphere was created during Late Cretaceous time as the magmatic expression of a newly formed subduction zone developed along the SW margin of Eurasia. 40 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Re-Os {{data for}} {{chromite}} separates from 10 massive chromitite seams sampled along the 550 -km {{length of the}} 2. 58 -Ga Great <b>Dyke</b> layered igneous <b>complex,</b> Zimbabwe, record initial 187 Os/ 188 Os ratios in the relatively narrow range between 0. 1106 and 0. 1126. This range of initial 187 Os/ 188 Os values is only slightly higher than the value for the coeval primitive upper mantle (0. 1107) as modeled from the Re-Os evolution of chondrites and data of modern mantle melts and mantle derived xenoliths. Analyses of Archean granitoid and gneiss samples from the Zimbabwe Craton show extremely low Os concentrations (3 - 9 ppt) with surprisingly unradiogenic present-day 187 Os/ 188 Os signatures between 0. 167 and 0. 297. Only one sample yields an elevated 187 Os/ 188 Os ratio of 1. 008. Using these data, the range of crustal contamination of the Great Dyke magma would be minimally 0 %- 33 % if the magma source was the primitive upper mantle, whereas the range estimated from Nd and Pb isotope systematics is 5 %- 25 %. If {{it is assumed that}} the primary Great Dyke magma derived from an enriched deep mantle reservoir (via a plume), a better agreement can be obtained. A significant contribution from a long-lived subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) reservoir with subchondritic Re/Os to the Great Dyke melts cannot be reconciled with the Os isotope results at all. However, Os isotope data on pre-Great <b>Dyke</b> ultramafic <b>complexes</b> of the Zimbabwe Craton and thermal modeling show that such an SCLM existed below the Zimbabwe Craton {{at the time of the}} Great Dyke intrusion. It is therefore concluded that large melt volumes such as that giving rise to the Great Dyke were able to pass lithospheric mantle keels without significant contamination in the late Archean. Because the ultramafic-mafic melts forming the Great Dyke must have originated below the SCLM (which extends to at least a 200 -km depth), the absence of an SCLM signature precludes a subduction-related magma-generation process...|$|R
