5|$|The Rampart Dam's {{large size}} had a {{correspondingly}} large price tag. The Corps of Engineers anticipated spending $618.4million (1970 dollars) on {{construction of the}} physical dam alone, another $492million for power-generating equipment, and $1.39billion in total. That total included $15.59million for relocating Alaskans from the area to be flooded, $56million for <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>wildlife</b> facilities to mitigate the anticipated losses, and $39.7million for roads and bridges to access the area. After completion of the dam, the Corps of Engineers estimated that operation and maintenance of the project would cost $6.5million annually, including $570,000 for replacement power equipment and $2million {{for the maintenance of}} <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>wildlife</b> facilities.|$|E

5|$|By the 1990s, the Federal {{government}} had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial {{decision by the}} U.S. <b>Fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wildlife</b> Service (which oversees threatened and endangered species), northwestern wolves imported from Canada were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004 but may be attributable to wolf migration to other nearby areas {{as suggested by the}} substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval. Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 1995–96. The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho has been so successful that on February 27, 2008, the U.S. <b>Fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wildlife</b> Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the capture of all the wild individuals of the California condor, in 1988 the US <b>Fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wildlife</b> Service began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive Andean condors into the wild in California. Only females were released to prevent it becoming an invasive species. The experiment was a success, and all the Andean condors were recaptured and re-released in South America before the reintroduction of the California condors took place.|$|E

5|$|Wolves were reintroduced {{into the}} Northern Rocky Mountains in the 1990s.

The tasks on the website include identifying tagged condors and marking the distance to feeding sources such as animal carcasses.
