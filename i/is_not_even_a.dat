25|$|The {{advent of}} quantum {{mechanics}} in the early 20th century and the formulation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in 1927 saw the end to the Newtonian mindset among physicists regarding the determinacy of nature. In quantum mechanics, there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> way to consider all observable elements in a system as random variables at once, since many observables do not commute.|$|E
25|$|The set {{of natural}} numbers N {{with the usual}} {{operations}} is not a ring, since (N, +) <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> group (the elements are not all invertible with respect to addition). For instance, there is no natural number which {{can be added to}} 3 to get 0 as a result. There is a natural way to make it a ring by adding negative numbers to the set, thus obtaining the ring of integers. The natural numbers (including 0) form an algebraic structure known as a semiring (which has all of the properties of a ring except the additive inverse property).|$|E

25|$|Primary {{destinations}} {{are usually}} cities and large towns, to which, {{as a result}} of their size, a high volume of traffic is expected to go. However, in rural areas, smaller towns or villages may be given primary status if located at junctions of significant roads: for example, Llangurig in Wales and Crianlarich in Scotland. As a further example, Scotch Corner in northern England <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> village—merely a hotel and a few other buildings—yet has the status of a primary destination due to its location at the interchange of the A1 and A66 roads. For similar reasons, certain airports, sea ports, bridges and tunnels have been designated as primary destinations.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, the Great Depression of the 1930s {{motivated}} studios {{to produce}} films with racy and violent content, which boosted ticket sales. Soon, the flouting {{of the code}} became an open secret. In 1931, The Hollywood Reporter mocked the code, and Variety followed suit in 1933. In {{the same year as}} the Variety article, a noted screenwriter stated that [...] "the Hays moral code <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> joke any more; it's just a memory." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{religious}} imagery belies Bacon's atheist and nihilistic outlook. The painting {{contains no}} hope for redemption. Friedhelm Mennekes writes that in the victim's scream, [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> lament of being forsaken by God. A god does not emerge for the figure jerking in mortal anguish in the painting". Sharpe identifies the tiny oblivious stick-figure passersby as the element that mostly removes the work from [...] "a straightforward recapitulation of ancient religious iconography and into postwar modernity".|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Farquaad tortures the Gingerbread Man for the {{location}} of the remaining fairytale creatures. His guards rush in with something he has been searching for: the Magic Mirror. He asks The Mirror if his kingdom is the fairest of them all but is told that he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> king. To be a king he must marry a princess, so Farquaad resolves to marry Princess Fiona, who is locked in a castle tower guarded by a dragon. He organizes a tournament wherein the winner gets the [...] "privilege" [...] of rescuing Fiona for him. Shrek and Donkey arrive during the tournament, and ignorantly defeat Farquaad's knights. Farquaad proclaims them the champions, and compels them under threat of death to rescue Fiona, promising to move the fairytale creatures from Shrek's swamp if he succeeds.|$|E
500|$|On September 17, 2003 Judge George Greer {{denied the}} petition, and wrote that [...] "the Petition {{is an attempt}} by Mr. and Mrs. Schindler to re-litigate the entire case. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> veiled or {{disguised}} attempt. The exhibits relied upon by them clearly demonstrate this to be true." [...] Regarding (Nurse) Iyer's statements, Greer wrote that they were [...] "incredible to say the least" [...] and that [...] "Ms. Iyer details {{what amounts to a}} 15-month cover-up April 1995 through July 1996 which include the staff of Palm Garden of Largo Convalescent Center, the Guardian of the Person, the guardian ad litem, the medical professionals, the police and, believe it or not, Mr. and Mrs. Schindler... It is impossible to believe that Mr. and Mrs. Schindler would not have subpoenaed Ms. Iyer for the January 2000 evidentiary hearing had Iyer contacted them in 1996 as her affidavit alleges".|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} argued, however, that privity <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> {{distinct}} doctrine, but rather simply part of consideration. Consideration is {{a rule that}} there must be a [...] "benefit or detriment" [...] involved in any contract, and that this must initially come from the promisee. It is argued that this rule and the doctrine of privity are two ways of saying the same thing - that to say someone is not a party to the contract is the same as saying that they gave no consideration in the initial agreement. This attitude is found in decisions by the Judiciary of England and Wales - in, Tweddle v Atkinson, Crompton and Blackburn JJ made the decision that they did because the claimant had not provided consideration, and the majority in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd based their judgment on a similar point. It is worth noting, however, that [...] Lord Haldane maintained in his judgement in Dunlop that, independent of consideration, it was a rule in English law that [...] "only a person who is party to a contract can sue on it".|$|E

2500|$|The American Medical Association was {{likewise}} not as appreciative. In {{an official}} press release in 1951, the AMA stated, [...] "It {{is hoped that}} no doctor will be uncritical enough {{to join in the}} promotion of Hadacol.

2500|$|There are however severe {{difficulties}} {{with this particular}} approach, for example the Hamiltonian operator is not self-adjoint, in fact it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> normal operator (i.e. the operator does not commute with its adjoint) and so the spectral theorem cannot be used to define the exponential in general. The most serious {{problem is that the}} 's are not mutually commuting, it can then be shown the formal quantity [...] cannot even define a (generalized) projector. The master constraint (see below) does not suffer from these problems and as such offers a way of connecting the canonical theory to the path integral formulation.|$|E

2500|$|The letters [...] at {{the ends}} of words without {{additional}} niqqud are silent and not transliterated.

The situation of the letter [...] at the end of a word after ẕere ֵ or seggol ֶ is more complicated, as they are silent in Classical Hebrew and in Hebrew Academy prescription and not transliterated in those systems, but they form diphthongs (ei) in Israeli Hebrewsee the vowels and diphthongs sections further down.
