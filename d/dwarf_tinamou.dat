25|$|The <b>dwarf</b> <b>tinamou</b> is a {{resident}} of the open plains of eastern Brazil, though there are fewer than 15,000 birds left. It has disappeared from its former range on the grasslands of Argentina. In the cerrado grasslands of Brazil the population of the lesser nothura has also decreased to fewer than 15,000 individuals because of agricultural and economic development. The practice of burning the fields is particularly detrimental to grassland tinamous. For example, the <b>dwarf</b> <b>tinamou</b> becomes intoxicated with the smoke and vulnerable to predators. Moreover, if the burning occurs during the nesting season, the eggs or chicks are roasted.|$|E

50|$|The <b>dwarf</b> <b>tinamou</b> (Taoniscus nanus) {{also known}} as the least tinamou, is a small, superficially partridge-like bird with short tail and wings.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dwarf</b> <b>tinamou</b> is {{currently}} {{threatened by the}} ongoing habitat loss caused by mechanised agriculture, intensive cattle-ranching, afforestation, invasive grasses, excessive use of pesticides and annual burning. It is also hunted by people for food in some areas. Farming and ranching are its largest threats. The <b>dwarf</b> <b>tinamou</b> is evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It has an occurrence range of 57700 km2, and the last population estimate, done in 2000, showed between 5,800 and 6,960 adults.|$|E

50|$|All tinamou {{are from}} the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, {{tinamous}} can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds. The <b>dwarf</b> <b>tinamou</b> is {{the only member of}} the genus Taoniscus and is a monotypic species.|$|E
50|$|Protected birds {{include the}} cock-tailed tyrant (Alectrurus tricolor), vinaceous-breasted amazon (Amazona vinacea), black-masked finch (Coryphaspiza melanotis), Brazilian merganser (Mergus octosetaceus), lesser nothura (Nothura minor) and the <b>dwarf</b> <b>tinamou</b> (Taoniscus nanus).Other {{protected}} species include the maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), cougar (Puma concolor), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), colocolo (Leopardus colocolo), giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) and the frog Phyllomedusa ayeaye.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dwarf</b> <b>tinamou</b> {{is found}} in the arid scrub grasslands, around 1000 m in elevation, {{restricted}} to the Cerrado region of interior southeastern Brazil in Distrito Federal, Goiás, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso do Sul, São Paulo and formerly Paraná. Specimens were also known from Paraguay (Misiones) and Argentina (the Río Bermejo in either Chaco or Formosa), but all recent records are from Brazil. It is, however, highly inconspicuous and easily overlooked.|$|E
5000|$|Tinamous are plump, compact {{birds with}} slender necks, small heads and, usually, short, [...] bills, {{though a few}} have long bills. Females are usually larger than the males. The {{smallest}} species, the <b>dwarf</b> <b>tinamou,</b> weighs about 43 g with a length of 14.5 cm. Females of the largest, the grey tinamou, weigh up to 2 kg with a length of up to 49 cm. Their feet have three forward-facing toes; a hind toe is either higher and retrogressed, or absent. The back of the tarsus is covered with scales, the color of which may aid in identification.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dwarf</b> <b>tinamou</b> is {{currently}} being conserved in three protected areas: Serra da Canastra National Park, Itapetininga Experimental Station and the IBGE Roncador Biological Reserve. Several areas adjacent to the Río Bermejo, Argentina, have been surveyed {{with the aid of}} tape-playback, but the species has not been found. It was also proposed to survey Serra do Cipó National Park, Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park and Emas National Park specifically for this species with the aid of tape-playback. And conduct further surveys in Argentina and Paraguay in the areas where the specimen was collected. It was also proposed to determine best management practices for existing protected areas and control the burning of cerrado habitats.|$|E
50|$|Most birds {{found in}} the Cerrado breed there {{although}} there are some Austral migrants (breed in temperate South America and winter in the Amazon basin) and Nearctic migrants (breed in temperate North America and winter in the Neotropics) that pass through. Most breeding birds in the Cerrado are found in more closed canopy areas like gallery forests although 27% of the birds breed only in open habitats and 21% breed in either open or closed habitats. Many of the birds in the Cerrado, especially those found in closed forest, are related to species from the Atlantic rainforest and also the Amazon rainforest. The crowned solitary eagle, hyacinth macaw, toco toucan, buff-necked ibis, <b>dwarf</b> <b>tinamou,</b> and Brazilian merganser are examples of birds {{found in the}} Cerrado.|$|E
