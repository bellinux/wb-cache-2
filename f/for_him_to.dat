5|$|According to {{writer and}} film {{director}} Jukka Virtanen, Vainio usually wrote his lyrics {{at the same}} time as the music. This is evident in the song Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä, written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who never got to dance at his own wedding. Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace, songs were never easy <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> write. His work did not become easier when he quit drinking, but it did become more emotional.|$|E

This ascetic lifestyle has been compared to similar thought in India during his time.|$|E

The disease lasted up to his stay in Britain, when his health improved because of the treatment and by having left the endemic zone.|$|E
