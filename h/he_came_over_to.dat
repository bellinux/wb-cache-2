2500|$|On September 19, 1968, Foley {{appeared}} in two Opry performances in Fort Wayne, Indiana, {{sponsored by the}} local Sheriff's Posse that included Billy Walker and 19-year-old Hank Williams, Jr., son of his long-time friend Hank Williams. Before the second show, according to Walker, Foley came to his dressing room and Walker shared his faith in Christ: Foley said, [...] "Do you think God could ever forgive a sinner like me?" [...] He began to tell me all the rotten things he had done in his life, and I {{looked him in the}} face and said, [...] "Red, if God can forgive me, He can forgive you." [...] I prayed with Red. [...] He went out, and the last song he sang was [...] "Peace in the Valley." [...] <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> side of the stage and said, 'Billy, I've never sung that song and feel the way I do tonight.' Foley suffered respiratory failure that night and died in his sleep, prompting Hank Williams, Jr. to write and record (as Luke the Drifter, Jr.) I Was With Red Foley (The Night He Passed Away). [...] According to the song, which charted that November, his last words were, [...] "I'm awful tired now, Hank. [...] I've got to go to bed." [...] Foley had sung [...] "Peace in the Valley" [...] at Hank Sr.'s funeral. [...] Foley was interred in Woodlawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Nashville.|$|E
2500|$|Mia {{initially}} {{thinks she}} {{is in love with}} popular jock Josh Richter, but by the second book, she acknowledges her feelings and states that she's been in love with Michael Moscovitz since the day <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> give Lilly a school project when they were in the first grade and he was in the fourth. From {{the end of the first}} book to the third, Mia has an unrequited crush on Michael, feelings which he finally returns in Princess in Love. Their relationship continues through Mia's sophomore year and Michael's first years at Columbia University but their relationship becomes slightly strained when Michael tells Mia he would like to have sex while Mia would prefer to wait until her prom night. Michael respects Mia's wishes but when Michael gets an offer to move to Japan, he believe it would be easier for their relationship as he is [...] "tired of taking cold showers". Mia proposes sex in order to keep him from leaving but is upset to find out that he slept with Judith Gershner before discovering her love for him and the two break up. Michael believes Mia is overreacting and attempts to reconcile with her before leaving for Japan but is hurt to find her sharing a kiss with J.P. Mia attempts to reunite and work out the distance situation but Michael decides that it is best they remain [...] "just friends" [...] and he still emails Mia regularly. When Michael returns from Japan after an absence of almost two years, he flirts with Mia during her interview for the school paper. Mia notices that Michael still looks incredibly hot and realises that she does still, indeed, love him. The two eventually kiss, despite Mia having a boyfriend, and Michael declares that he still loves Mia and will wait for her. They reunited on Mia's prom night and they have sex.|$|E

6000|$|... "Won't you <b>come</b> in?" [...] <b>he</b> invited. [...] "There's just Mr. Pettigrew here--the vet from Barnstaple. <b>He's</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{look at one}} of my cows." ...|$|R
50|$|Allie gets {{a project}} from her teacher and Miles is her partner. <b>He</b> <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> study {{but they need}} help from her parents who wrote the book they are {{studying}} on.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> her side, his hat {{and gloves}} in his hand, {{prepared}} for departure.|$|E
60|$|So {{far from}} {{avoiding}} her, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> her side directly he had greeted his hostess.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{the table}} and {{stood in front of}} it {{as though it were a}} lectern.|$|E
6000|$|... "Has <b>he</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> obtain {{aid from}} England?" [...] she asked. [...] "From the papers this morning {{it seems as}} though one of the Powers would have to {{interfere}} and straighten things out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not, {{after what}} you have said, Adolphus. If <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Allington, <b>he</b> will see me in mamma's house, to which {{he has always been}} made welcome by her. Of course I {{understand}} perfectly--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He comes {{every day}} to Theos to send off his cables," [...] Domiloff answered. [...] "I shall send you word where he is, and you must send for him. It is {{absolutely}} necessary that <b>he</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> our side." ...|$|R

60|$|He {{knew then}} that my words were true, and <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> my side with a great despair in his dark eyes.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Donnie tails one of {{the cocaine}} dealers to a restaurant, where his friend Captain Michael Wong happens to be having breakfast with a girl. <b>He</b> <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> say hi to Donnie, {{inadvertently}} obscuring Donnie's view as the cocaine dealer leaves. Both of them run outside {{in search of the}} criminal, but are ambushed by a couple martial artists. Donnie easily beats up both thugs and arrests them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see through}} it," [...] Charles exclaimed. [...] "He finds he's made a mistake; and now <b>he's</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> here <b>to</b> reopen negotiations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But he is though; {{that very}} young man! <b>He's</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{make it up}} with her. He's told me so with his own mouth. You may be as sure of it as,--as,--as anything. You leave 'em to me, Mrs. Ray; I wouldn't bring them {{together}} if it wasn't for good.

60|$|My exclamation {{attracted}} Kersdale's attention. He glanced our way carelessly, {{but in that}} glance took in everything. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> us, {{but without}} haste.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{her side}} {{once more and}} laid his hand soothingly on hers. It was heart-rending to witness the agony of the woman he loved.|$|E
60|$|He {{took up his}} cue {{and scored}} an {{excellent}} break. She followed suit, and he broke down at an easy cannon. Then <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> her side.|$|E
60|$|Lady Caroom put her sketch away as {{she heard}} their {{approaching}} footsteps, and looked up. Atherstone's happiness was too ridiculously apparent. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> straight <b>over</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|R
50|$|In a small town, a pair {{of aging}} sisters live together. Every day they pass a store where the third protagonist lives. One of them has a crush on him, and the other can't stand him.

60|$|My apprehensions were justified. Mitchell topped his ball. It rolled {{twenty yards}} into the rough, and nestled under a dock-leaf. His mouth opened, then {{closed with a}} snap. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> where Millicent and I were standing.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Amelia and apologised profusely, and she {{with her}} usual {{kindness}} of heart hastened to assure {{him that she}} quite understood {{that it was an}} accident. Then we all went again to the wall and looked over.|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet," [...] said Nora, [...] "what harm has he done? I wish <b>he</b> had not <b>come,</b> because, of course, {{people will}} talk! But nothing was more natural than that <b>he</b> should <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> see us {{when he was}} so near us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right, Dolly. There's some on your flounces. But, Lor' bless you, Dolly, it don't {{matter to}} him. It's not your dress he looks at, but your face. Now I shouldn't be very {{surprised}} if <b>he</b> hadn't <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> ask you from father." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> Kamal <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> me and said, 'Madhavan, I {{have seen}} some of your work and they were good.' ... Then he continued, 'I have {{something}} for you.

60|$|Ruth had {{not been}} many hours in the house before she learnt from her fellow-servants that Mr. Gulston had been over {{two or three times}} since the {{shooting}} party, and that the servants in general had an opinion that <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> see Miss Carne.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> her, {{and touched}} her delicately. Her heart beat with wild passion, wild raging passion. But she {{resisted}} as yet.

6000|$|... "He hasn't {{been at it}} very long, but I'm sure he'll get on. He's immensely {{in earnest}} and very good-looking. I just said that if <b>he</b> should <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> see us you might rather like to meet him. He might give you some tips, as my husband says." ...|$|R
