5|$|Through {{most of the}} Archean Eon, the Earth had a <b>heat</b> <b>production</b> {{at least}} twice that of the present, which caused tectonic {{processes}} to be more active.

5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat {{comes from}} a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion (about 20%) and heat produced through radioactive decay (80%). The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232. At the center, the temperature may be up to , and the pressure could reach 360GPa. Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's <b>heat</b> <b>production</b> was much higher. At approximately , twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{guinea pigs}} in {{scientific}} experimentation dates {{back at least}} to the 17th century, when the Italian biologists Marcello Malpighi and Carlo Fracassati conducted vivisections of guinea pigs in their examinations of anatomic structures. In 1780, Antoine Lavoisier used a guinea pig in his experiments with the calorimeter, a device used to measure <b>heat</b> <b>production.</b> The heat from the guinea pig's respiration melted snow surrounding the calorimeter, showing that respiratory gas exchange is a combustion, similar to a candle burning. Guinea pigs {{played a major role in}} the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century, through the experiments of Louis Pasteur, Émile Roux, and Robert Koch. Guinea pigs have been launched into orbital space flight several times, first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9, 1961 – with a successful recovery. China also launched and recovered a biosatellite in 1990 which included guinea pigs as passengers.|$|E

40|$|Astra Zeneca {{plant in}} Gärtuna has many {{compression}} cooling machines for comfort that consume about 11. 7 GWh of electricity per year. Many of the cooling machines are old; {{due to the}} increase of production of the plant, cooling capacity was limited and new machines have been built. Now, the cooling capacity is over-sized. Söderenergi is the district heating plant that supplies heating to Astra Zeneca plant. Due to the strict environmental policy in the energy plant, last year, a bio-fuelled CHP plant was built. It is awarded with the electricity certificate system. The study investigates the possibility for converting some of the compression cooling to absorption cooling and then analyzes {{the effects of the}} district heating system through MODEST optimizations. The effects of the analysis are studied in a system composed by the district heating system in Södertälje and cooling system in Astra Zeneca. In the current system the district <b>heating</b> <b>production</b> is from boiler and compression system supplies cooling to Astra Zeneca. The future system includes a CHP plant for the <b>heating</b> <b>production,</b> and compression system is converted to absorption system in Astra Zeneca. Four effects are analyzed in the system: optimal distribution of the district <b>heating</b> <b>production</b> with the plants available, saving fuel, environmental impact and total cost. The environmental impact has been analyzed considering the marginal electricity from coal condensing plants. The total cost is divided in two parts: production cost, in which district heating cost, purchase of electricity and Emissions Trading cost are included, and investment costs. The progressive changes are introduced in the system as four different scenarios. The introduction of the absorption machines in the system with the current district <b>heating</b> <b>production</b> increases the total cost due to the low electricity price in Sweden. The introduction of the CHP plant in the district <b>heating</b> <b>production</b> supposes a profit of the production cost with compression system due to the high income of the electricity produced that is sold to the grid; it profit increases when compression is replaced by absorption system. The fuel used in the production of the future system decreases and also the emissions. Then, the future system becomes an opportunity from an environmental and economical point of view. At higher purchase electricity prices predicted in the open electricity market for an immediately future, the future system will become more economically advantageous. ...|$|R

40|$|Biofuel {{production}} through polygeneration {{with heat}} {{as one of}} the by-products implies a possibility for cooperation between transport and district heating sectors by introducing large-scale biofuel <b>production</b> into district <b>heating</b> systems. The cooperation may have effects on both the biofuel production costs and the district <b>heating</b> <b>production</b> costs. This paper is {{the second part of the}} study that investigates those effects. The biofuel production costs evaluation, considering heat and electricity as by-products, was performed in the first part of the study. In this second part of the study, an evaluation of how such cooperation would influence the district <b>heating</b> <b>production</b> costs using Stockholm's district heating system as a case study was performed. The plants introduced in the district heating system were chosen depending on the future development of the transport sector. In order to perform sensitivity analyses of different energy market conditions, two energy market scenarios were applied. Despite the higher revenues from the sale of by-products, due to the capital intense investments required, the introduction of large-scale biofuel production into the district heating system does not guarantee economic benefits. Profitability is highly dependent on the types of biofuel production plants and energy market scenarios. The results show that large-scale biogas and ethanol production may lead to a significant reduction in the district <b>heating</b> <b>production</b> costs in both energy market scenarios, especially if support for transportation fuel produced from renewable energy sources is included. If the total biomass capacity of the biofuel production plants introduced into the district heating system is 900  MW, the district <b>heating</b> <b>production</b> costs would be negative and the whole public transport sector and more than 50 % of the private cars in the region could be run on the ethanol and biogas produced. The profitability is shown to be lower if the raw biogas that is by-produced in the biofuel production plants is used for combined and power production instead of being sold as transportation fuel; however, this strategy may still result in profitability if the support for transportation fuel produced from renewable energy sources is included. Investments in Fischer–Tropsch diesel and dimethyl ether production are competitive to the investments in combined and power production only if high support for transportation fuel produced from renewable energy sources is included...|$|R

This model is based mainly on the adsorption equilibrium equations of the adsorbent-refrigerant pair and heat flows. The simulation results of 26 various activated carbon-ammonia pairs for three cycles (single bed, two-bed and infinite number of beds) are presented at typical conditions for ice making, air conditioning and heat pumping applications. The driving temperature varies from 80 degrees C to 200 degrees C. The carbon absorbents investigated are mainly coconut shell and coal based types in multiple forms: monolithic, granular, compacted granular, fibre, compacted fibre, cloth, compacted cloth and powder. Considering a two-bed cycle, the best thermal performances based on power density are obtained with the monolithic carbon KOH-AC, with a driving temperature of 100 degrees C; the cooling production is about 66 MJ m(- 3) (COP = 0. 45) and 151 MJ m(- 3) (COP = 0. 61) for ice making and air conditioning respectively; the <b>heating</b> <b>production</b> is about 236 MJ m(- 3) (COP = 1. 50) ...|$|R

Performance of integrated production is {{compared with that of}} an FT stand-alone plant on the basis of wood fuel-to-FT crude efficiency, GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions balances and FT crude production cost. The results show that there exists a heat integration opportunity for an FT crude plant ranging from 0 up to 350  MW (LHV) of wood fuel depending on the development pathway for the mill.

Since most of the negative replications from 1989–1990 did not report their ratios, this has been proposed as an explanation for failed replications. This loading ratio is hard to obtain, and some batches of palladium never reach it because the pressure causes cracks in the palladium, allowing the deuterium to escape.
