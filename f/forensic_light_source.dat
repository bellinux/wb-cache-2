This new technology was named by the Powerhouse Museum {{as one of the top}} 100 Australian innovations of the 20th century.

40|$|Lasers and {{alternate}} light {{sources have}} been recognized as effective tools for latent print detection for over three decades. Luminescence often increases friction ridge contrast to reveal impressions otherwise undetectable. Indanedione/zinc chloride excited by a <b>forensic</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> is widely recognized as an effective process for developing latent prints on porous surfaces. This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the use of a combination of luminescence excitation and indanedione with zinc chloride to detect latent prints on stones, bricks, and similar difficult porous surfaces. The wavelengths evaluated included 400 nm (violet), 447 nm (blue), 532 nm (green), and 645 nm (red). Latent prints were deposited on a variety of porous surfaces including bricks, cement stones, wood, and cotton fabric, all commonly encountered at crime scenes in China. The surfaces were examined using white light (light-emitting diode flashlight) and laser light sources separately, both before and after treatment with indanedione/zinc chloride. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate various light sources for their effectiveness in detecting impressions developed by indanedione/zinc chloride on difficult porous surfaces. Results indicated that latent prints on some brick and cement stone surfaces may be effectively detected using 532 nm laser excitation after indanedione/zinc chloride processing...|$|E

Opredeli osnovne parametre za pravilno eksponiranje fotografije, pojem globinske ostrine, predstavi objektive ter del nameni svetlobi, kontrastu vira svetlobe in svetlobnih odbojev. V nadaljevanju specificira fotografijo v forenzični vlogi. Opredeli situacijski posnetek, posnetek relativne bližine in bližnji posnetek. Osredini se na teorijo fotografiranja krvnih sledov. Predstavi problematične površine nahajanja krvnih sledi, uporabo kemijskih reagentov ter za te namene uporabo bliskavice pri fotografiranju. Prav tako se dotakne teorije fotografiranja sledi obuval ter opredeli reliefne in ploske sledi obuval. Na koncu teoretičnega dela se dotakne še digitalnega rokovanja s fotografijami v smislu digitalne postprodukcije. V empiričnem delu se osredini na fotografiranje reliefnih sledi obuval. Pri dveh sledeh istega obuvala z različno debelino podlage in globino ugreza obuvala pri isti strukturi podlage preizkuša, kako kot svetlobe vpliva na prepoznavo karakteristik obuvala na fotografiji. Reagiranje svetlobe na sled preizkuša iz treh različnih položajev po krožnici okrog sledi obuvala iz treh različnih kotov naklona – 25 -, 50 - in 75 -stopinjskega kota vpadne svetlobe. Ob koncu tega dela analizira ugotovitve in poda statistične podatke izraženosti kontrolnih točk glede na globino sledi, položaj in kot svetlobe. Ugotavlja, da sta za fotografiranje profilnih sledi obuval, najbolj ugodna kota vpadne svetlobe, 25 in 50 stopinj. V empiričnem delu opravi tudi poskus fotografiranja krvnih sledi na bombažni tkanini. Za preizkus vzame 5 različnih barv iste tkanine, na katere odtisne krvavo sled obuvala, ki je kontaminirano s svinjsko krvjo. V nadaljevanju sledi fotografira s tremi različnimi tipi svetlobe - LED lučjo, forenzičnim svetlobnim virom pri 415 nm ter forenzičnim svetlobnim virom pri 415 nm z uporabo rumenega filtra na objektivu fotoaparata. Ugotavlja, da se pri eksperimentu najbolj obnese forenzični vir svetlobe pri 415 nm z rumenim filtrom na objektivu, saj daje izboljšane rezultate pri rdeči, bordo rdeči in oranžni podlagi. In the theoreticalpart of {{the thesis}} the author {{presents}} {{the basis of}} photography. He defines thebasic parameters for a correct photography exposure, the notion of in-depth focus, he introduces thelenses and devotes part of the thesis to light,to the contrast of the light source and light reflections. Further on he specifies the role of photography in forensics. He introduces the internal instructions for photographing a site of criminal offense in line with theinstructions of the Slovenian Police and defines a situationalsite-specific shot, a relative-proximity shot, and a close-up shot. He focuses on the theory of photography of blood stains. He presents problematic surfaces stained with blood, the usage of chemical reagentsas well as the usage of a flash light {{for the purpose of}} such photography. He also touches the theory of photography in relation to photographic capturing of footprints, classifying them into profiled and flat footprints. At the end of the theoretical part of the thesis he tackles digital manipulation of photographs in the sense of digital postproduction. In the empirical part of the thesis he focuses on capturing profiled footprints. With two different imprints of the very same footwearat a different thickness of the walked surface and the depth of the impression of the footwear at the very same structure of the surface he tests how the light’s angle impacts the identification of the photographed footwear’s characteristics. He tests the reaction of light to the footprint from three different positions on the circle around the footprint, at three different angles: a 25 -, 50 -and a 75 degree angle of the incoming light source. At the end of this part he analyses his findings and gives the so acquired statistical data concerning the pronounceability of control points in correlation to the depth of the footprints, the position and the angle of the light source. 25 and 50 degree angles from which the light is emitted {{turn out to be the}} most efficient ones. In the empiric part of his thesis he carries out an experimentof photographing blood stains on cotton fabrics. In his experiment he uses 5 different colours of the same fabric, on which he imprints a blood trace of a footprint, contaminated with pig blood. Then he photographs the footprints at three different types of illumination- LED light, a <b>forensic</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> at 415 nm, and a <b>forensic</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> at 415 nm with a yellow filter over the camera lens. He analyses his findings in the conclusion of the thesis and gives his opinion...|$|E

50|$|Lawsone is {{hypothesized}} {{to undergo a}} reaction similar to Strecker synthesis in reactions with amino acids. Recent {{research has been conducted}} on lawsone's potential applications in the forensic science field. Since lawsone shows many similarities with ninhydrin, the current reagent for latent fingerprint development, studies have been conducted to see if lawsone can be used in this field. As of now the research is inconclusive, but optimistic. Lawsone non-specifically targets primary amino acids, and displays photoluminescence with <b>forensic</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources.</b> It has a characteristic purple/brown coloration as opposed to the purple/blue associated with ninhydrin.Lawsone shows promise as a reagent for fingerprint detection because of its photoluminescence maximized at 640nm, which is high enough that it avoids background interference common for ninhydrin.|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of traces is a main task of forensics. Hyperspectral imaging {{is a potential}} method from which we expect to capture more fluorescence effects than with common <b>forensic</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources.</b> This paper shows {{that the use of}} hyperspectral imaging is suited for the analysis of latent traces and extends the classical concept to the conservation of the crime scene for retrospective laboratory analysis. We examine specimen of blood, semen and saliva traces in several dilution steps, prepared on cardboard substrate. As our key result we successfully make latent traces visible up to dilution factor of 1 : 8000. We can attribute most of the detectability to interference of electromagnetic light with the water content of the traces in the shortwave infrared region of the spectrum. In a classification task we use several dimensionality reduction methods (PCA and LDA) in combination with a Maximum Likelihood classifier, assuming normally distributed data. Further, we use Random Forest as a competitive approach. The classifiers retrieve the exact positions of labelled trace preparation up to highest dilution and determine posterior probabilities. By modelling the classification task with a Markov Random Field we are able to integrate prior information about the spatial relation of neighboured pixel labels...|$|R
30|$|The cyanoacrylate-developed print may {{be further}} {{enhanced}} by dusting with regular or magnetic fingerprint powder (Ramotowski 2012). The cyanoacrylate developed fingerprints can further {{be enhanced by}} using Rhodamine 6 G (Jian and Dao-an 1991). Morris (1992) suggested the use of basic yellow 40 in place of gentian violet for enhancing cyanoacrylate-fumed fingermarks on adhesive side of tape. Isaac (1993) used rhodamine 6 G for enhancing cyanoacrylate-fumed fingermarks on different kinds of self-adhesive tapes. Kobus et al. (1983) suggested the use of gentian violet and coumarin 540 to {{enhance the quality of}} cyanoacrylate developed prints on polyethylene and aluminium foil respectively. Chesher et al. (1992) used acid fuchsin, Nile blue A, safranin bluish and Rit® fabric dye in combination with OMNIPRINTTM 1000 alternate light source to enhance the quality of cyanoacrylate developed prints on white polyethylene dinner plate. Post-treatment with vapors of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde was suggested {{to improve the quality of}} cyanoacrylate-fumed latent fingerprints on solvent-sensitive surfaces such as oil marker writings and materials with rough surfaces such as unglazed earthenware (Takatsu et al. 2012). The use of RAY (Rhodamine, Ardrox, Basic Yellow) dye stain, gentian violet and alternate powder was suggested for enhancing the quality of cyanoacrylate-developed fingerprints on the adhesive side of various kinds of tapes. Processing of cyanoacrylate fumed prints with gentian violet, followed by alternate powder and finally with RAY dye stain was suggested as best processing sequence to enhance the quality of developed prints (Wilson 2010). Chadwick et al. (2014) observed that staining of Polycyano UV processed marks with rhodamine 6 G significantly improves its performance on aluminium, glass and polyethylene bags. The use of sublimating dyes such as 1 -amino- 2 -phenoxy- 4 -hydroxy-anthraquinone and 1, 4 -bis-(ethylamino)-anthraquinone was suggested to enhance the quality of cyanoacrylate developed (fresh and aged upto 2  months) prints on plastics, metals and glass surfaces. The particles of dyes adhere to polymerized cyanoacrylate and provide red purple or blue color to it (Morimoto et al. 1998). Lock et al. (1995) suggested the use of europium thenoyltrifluoroacetone ortho-phenanthroline (EuTTAPhen) complex for enhancing the quality of cyanoacrylate-developed prints. Olenik (2015) described a procedure to develop latent fingermarks on smooth and adhesive sides of duct tape and other plastic tapes, including black electrical tape using cyanoacrylate fuming followed by dyeing with basic yellow 40. The procedure involves the fuming of tape with cyanoacrylate vapors followed by application of basic yellow 40. After dyeing, tape is rinsed under running tap water, followed by drying and visualized with orange or yellow goggles under blue light as well as under <b>forensic</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> in the range of 415 to 485  nm. Menzel et al. (1983) observed that application of post-treatment procedures (dusting, staining and ninhydrin/zinc chloride) to cyanoacrylate developed prints significantly improves the detectibility of latent prints. They suggested the use to ultraviolet and blue-green argon-ion laser together with fluorescent powder dusting, fluorescent dye staining and ninhydrin/zinc chloride post-processing of cyanoacrylate developed prints. Sonnex et al. (2016) used cyanoacrylate fuming followed by Infrared spectral mapping for visualization and enhancement of latent fingermarks on smooth, shiny fabrics such as silk, nylon and polyester, of different colors and patterns. However, due to the presence of carbonyl functional group in cotton and polycotton and their absorbency to latent fingermark residues, these fabrics gave poor results. Stoltzfus and Rebane (2016) used NIR two-photon induced fluorescence imaging technique to image cyanoacrylate processed fingermarks on highly-reflective substrates. Chadwick et al. (2011) suggested the use of styryl 11, a laser dye, over rhodamine 6 G for the enhancement of cyanoacrylate-developed fingermarks in near-infrared region. The luminescence emission intensity of STaR 11, combination of styryl 11 and rhodamine 6 G, was better than styryl 11 and rhodamine 6 G individually and could be used for enhancing the visualization of cyanoacrylate-developed fingermarks on multicolored glossy cardboard in visible and near-infrared regions.|$|E
30|$|In addition, {{barcodes}} {{also help}} to prevent crime (Gooch et al. 2016). Nanotechnology helps in determining {{the authenticity of the}} items. Nanotechnology can also be applied in various sectors to prevent them from forged or duplicate products (Gooch et al. 2016). Counterfeiting or duplication of products leads to major economic loss and reputation of the respective companies and their countries. Product authenticity is directly linked to the reliability and reputation of the company; if a customer purchases the forged or duplicate products then reliability of the products and reputation of the company will be gone. If companies fabricated forged products and pass them off as authentic, it may affect both consumers and companies as they suffer losses. Uses of watermarks may help to prevent duplication of products by differentiating genuine from forged products (Gooch et al. 2016). With the help of nanotechnology, various tools are being developed that could be able to differentiate forged products from authentic one. In this way, nanotechnology helps to prevent counterfeit crime. Nano technology has been developed nanofibers and nanodots with diverse colors to detect duplicate products. These nanofibers and nanodots have been detected using various <b>forensic</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> that are meant to decipher the nanofibers and nanodots. So, in this way, counterfeit crime has been prevented (Teeuw et al. 2008).|$|R

The (mostly) parallel rays of such instruments tends to cast hard shadows, unlike soft <b>light</b> <b>sources.</b>|$|R
