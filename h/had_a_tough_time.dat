25|$|In 2013, Purser {{helped the}} Hawks return to {{championship}} contenders. The Hawks did well {{to finish the}} regular season with an 18–8 record to be second position in the standings but they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>time</b> of it against the Mandurah Magic in the quarter-finals. The Magic won Game 1 in Mandurah 107–96 but then the Hawks responded to win Game 2 106–90 and then the deciding third game 84–74 both at home {{to advance to the}} semi-finals. They went on to lose in straight sets to the Wanneroo Wolves in the semi-finals; the Wolves prevailed 107–91 in Game 1 in Joondalup before winning the series with a 104–98 victory in Game 2, with the Hawks bowing out of the finals at home. Purser was again a dominant force during the 2013 season, recording six double-doubles and scoring three 30+ point games.

25|$|The Centennials {{struggled}} in the 1993–94 season, {{one that was}} truncated by the trade {{of two of the}} team's most dynamic offensive players, Bill Muckalt and Joe Rybar, to the Kelowna Spartans midway through the season.This was a year Merritt would off-load several key players in an effort to rebuild the team. Goaltenders Joe Kennedy and up and coming athletic goaltender Jason Taylor were moved as well along with Rob Szatsmary forward and Ryan Beamin a solid defensemen. Merritt <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>time,</b> especially after the trades, and finished the regular season at the bottom of both the Interior Division and the BCJHL with a record of 16–39–5 for just 37 points. The Centennials missed the playoffs while Kelowna Spartans would {{go all the way to}} the Centennial Cup championship, only to lose to the Olds Grizzlys. At the 1994 NHL Entry Draft, Muckalt was chosen in the ninth round, 221st overall by the Vancouver Canucks. Former Centennial Mike Josephson, who had moved on to the WHL's Kamloops Blazers, was chosen 196th overall by Chicago.|$|E

500|$|There {{were two}} fight {{scenes in the}} film. For realism, the actors fought without rehearsing. Although the first scene {{utilised}} music and other technical enhancements, Pothan wanted the climactic fight to look more natural: [...] "I felt {{it would be better}} to film it without its cinematic nature. To be able to relate to the scene, it had to look natural. Fahadh and Sujith <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>time</b> while shooting". The scene was filmed in four days on muddy grounds near the Cheruthoni and Idukki Dams. The film's appooppan thadi (milkweeds) were artificial; about 1,000 were made from lightweight materials. In a scene where Crispin cuts them down, most blew upward like real milkweeds and the scene had to be re-shot several times. The film was made on a budget of 4.50 crore.|$|E

With the others, you'd have to practice three, four, five times". At school she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>time,</b> since some girls bullied her because they envied her voice.

[...] Although the costume defined {{each of the three}} characters in Anniyan, there were scenes where Ambi would suddenly become Remo and Remo would become Anniyan. There I made it dramatic to bring out each character." [...] He credited his wife Shailaja Balakrishnan, a psychologist, for helping him in fleshing out the character of Ambi, a person who has multiple personality disorder. In a conversation with film critic Baradwaj Rangan, Shailaja recalled the times the film was being made and spoke of Vikram, saying, [...] "I felt we should live in two houses. It's not easy to live with a man who can get that eccentric, an actor who wants to be that difficult on himself. I wouldn't say he becomes the character, but there's definitely some kind of internalisation." [...] Vikram confessed that he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>time</b> during the film's making as playing different characters affected him and he found himself going mad. He added that he would take a break after a 15-day shoot and watch the pigeons on his terrace as a way of dealing with the pressure.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{score was}} composed by Carter Burwell, {{a veteran of}} all the Coen Brothers' films. While the Coens were writing the screenplay they had Kenny Rogers' [...] "Just Dropped In (to See What Condition My Condition Was in)", the Gipsy Kings' cover of [...] "Hotel California", and several Creedence Clearwater Revival songs in mind. They asked T-Bone Burnett (who would later work with the Coens on O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Inside Llewyn Davis) to pick songs for the soundtrack of the film. They knew that they wanted different genres of music from different times but, as Joel remembers, [...] "T-Bone even came up with some far-out Henry Mancini and Yma Sumac." [...] Burnett was able to secure songs by Kenny Rogers and the Gipsy Kings and also added tracks by Captain Beefheart, Moondog and Bob Dylan's [...] "The Man in Me" [...] (from New Morning). However, he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>time</b> securing the rights to Townes Van Zandt's cover of the Rolling Stones' [...] "Dead Flowers", which plays over the film's closing credits. Former Stones manager Allen Klein owned {{the rights to the}} song and wanted $150,000 for it. Burnett convinced Klein to watch an early cut of the film and remembers, [...] "It got to the part where the Dude says, 'I hate the fuckin' Eagles, man!' Klein stands up and says, 'That's it, you can have the song!' That was beautiful." [...] Burnett was going to be credited on the film as [...] "Music Supervisor", but asked his credit to be [...] "Music Archivist" [...] because he [...] "hated the notion of being a supervisor; I wouldn't want anyone to think of me as management".|$|E

[...] By the time the picture was released, Chandler was thoroughly disillusioned with the writers' lot in Hollywood; he published an angry piece titled [...] "Writers in Hollywood" [...] for The Atlantic Monthly in November 1945 in which he complained: [...] "The first picture I worked on was nominated for an Academy Award (if that means anything), but I was not even invited to the press review held right in the studio." [...] He neglected, however, {{to mention that the}} studio had kept him on salary during the eight-week shooting schedule and that no changes to the script were allowed without his approval – a very rare accommodation for screenwriters, particularly newcomers, in those days. Offended, Wilder responded by saying, [...] "We didn't invite him? How could we? He was under the table drunk at Lucy's," [...] a nearby watering hole for Paramount employees. This relationship with Chandler is what drew Wilder to his next project, the Best Picture-winning The Lost Weekend, about an alcoholic writer. Wilder made the film, in part, [...] "to explain Chandler to himself." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{dominating}} in the Qualifying Tournament, Lithuania <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>time</b> at the Olympics. The {{first game}} against Argentina {{turned into a}} fiasco, as the South Americans forced Lithuania into a double-digit deficit in the first half, and kept a comfortable lead {{in the second half}} to finish the game strong, 102–79. Luis Scola, who was held down to 13 points in the quarterfinal match against Lithuania two years ago at the World Championship, led Argentina with 32 points. Lithuania rebounded from the loss playing with Nigeria, which also served to avenge the only defeat in the Qualifying Tournament. Playing exemplary defense against the Nigerian bigs Al-Farouq Aminu and Ike Diogu, Lithuania handily won 72–53. Next was another defeat, as France rode Tony Parker and Boris Diaw to win the game 74–82. The following game was against USA, which had just broke recordswith their 156–73 blowout of Nigeria. Right from the beginning, Lithuania proved to be a tough opponent for Team USA, with Linas Kleiza scoring 25 points, and former Duke player Martynas Pocius having 7 rebounds and 6 assists. The Lithuania were down by only 4 points at the half and 6 {{at the end of the}} third quarter. In the final quarter, Lithuania momentarily took the lead 84–82, but lost it again as LeBron James scored 9 points in 4 minutes to achieve a 94–99 win. ESPN's Marc Stein reacted to the near-defeat remembering the other struggle the [...] "Dream Team" [...] had with Lithuania in 2000, and adding that even if it was [...] "the weakest Lithuanian team they've ever faced in Olympic basketball competition, a limited Lithuania is still Lithuania. Still stubborn. Still dangerous. Still causing a variety of problems for USA Basketball." ...|$|E
