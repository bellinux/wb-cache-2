40|$|Regression mixture {{models have}} been {{increasingly}} applied {{in the social and}} behavioral sciences as a method for identifying <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> of predictors on outcomes. Although the typical specification of this approach is sensitive to violations of distributional assumptions, alternative methods for capturing the number of <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> {{have been shown to be}} robust. Yet, there is still a need to better describe <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> that exist when using regression mixture models. This study tests a new approach that uses sets of classes (called <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> sets) to simultaneously model <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> and account for nonnormal error distributions. Monte Carlo simulations are used to examine the performance of the approach. The number of classes needed to represent departures from normality is shown to be dependent on the degree of skew. The use of <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> sets reduced bias in parameter estimates. Applied analyses demonstrated the implementation of the approach for describing <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> of parental health problems on adolescent body mass index using <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> sets approach.

We show how data from a multi-site experimental evaluation in which subjects are randomly assigned to any treatment versus a control group who receives no treatment can be combined with non-experimental regression-adjustment methods to estimate the <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> of particular types of treatments. We also devise tests {{of the validity of}} using the latter methods. We use these methods and tests to re-analyze data from the MDRC Evaluation of California%u 2019 s Greater Avenues to Independence (GAIN) program. While not designed to estimate the <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> of the Labor Force Attachment (LFA) training and Human Capital Development (HCD) training components used in this program, we show how data from this experimental evaluation can be used in conjunction with non-experimental methods to estimate such effects. We present estimates of both the short- and long-term <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> of these two training components on employment and earnings. We find that while there are short-term positive <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> of LFA versus HCD, the latter training component is relatively more beneficial in the longer-term. ...|$|R

40|$|Research {{increasingly}} emphasizes understanding <b>differential</b> <b>effects.</b> This {{article focuses}} on understanding regression mixture models, which are relatively new statistical methods for assessing <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> by comparing results to using an interactive term in linear regression. The research questions which each model answers, their formulation, and their assumptions are compared using Monte Carlo simulations and real data analysis. The capabilities of regression mixture models are described and specific issues to be addressed when conducting regression mixtures are proposed. The article aims to clarify the role that regression mixtures can take in the estimation of <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> and increase awareness of the benefits and potential pitfalls of this approach. Regression mixture models are {{shown to be a}} potentially effective exploratory method for finding <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> when these effects can be defined by a small number of classes of respondents who share a typical relationship between a predictor and an outcome. It is also shown that the comparison between regression mixture models and interactions becomes substantially more complex as the number of classes increases. It is argued that regression interactions are well suited for direct tests of specific hypotheses about <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> and regression mixtures provide a useful approach for exploring effect heterogeneity given adequate samples and study design...|$|R

50|$|Piscivorin reduces high potassium-evoked {{smooth muscle}} {{contraction}}, {{but does not}} inhibit caffeine-stimulated contraction of smooth muscle. Since caffeine normally causes contraction through the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, this <b>differential</b> <b>effect</b> indicates that piscivorin is an L-type calcium channel blocker. At a concentration of 1 μM, its effect on depolarization-induced smooth muscle contraction is weaker than of the related CRISP family toxins ablomin, triflin or latisemin. A sequence comparison of piscivorin and other CRISP family proteins suggests that the Glu186 residue is the crucial site for the blocking of the calcium channels.|$|E

[...] The cost of caregiving is exorbitant, nearly 5 times what Medicaid would have spent on long term care, meaning only wealthy families can afford to do this type of in-home care. The intersection of class and race in this phenomenon is an important place to explore as less advantaged families will have to rely on government care, potentially at the risk of having less quality care. These statistics also highlight a <b>differential</b> <b>effect</b> on women, showing that women disproportionately do caregiving work.|$|E

We find that Islamic mutual funds in countries with higher legal conditions receive lower fees, whereas conventional funds receive higher carried interest, lower fixed management fees and weaker expense ratio. Overall, Hoefsted culture’s measures affect significantly the fees’ structure with robust <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> on Islamic and conventional funds. Focusing on political risk effects, we show that, in countries with higher political risk, the compensation fees and expense ratio will be higher.

However, the {{evidence about}} the mechanism producing these effects is less clear. Some scholars have arguedfor mechanisms that would imply greater effects of small classes for low-achieving students. This article investigates possible <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> of small classes on achievement using data from Project STAR, a four-year, large-scale randomized experiment on the effects of class size. We examined the <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> of small classes for students in the bottom half and bottom quarter, respectively, of their class's achievement distribution in kindergarten. Although small class effects are somewhat largerfor low-achieving students in reading, the <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> (in-teractions) are not statistically significant. Moreover, the small class effects for low-achieving students in mathematics are actually smaller than those for higher achieving students. Thus while there are un-ambiguous positive effects of small classes on achievement, there is no evidence for differentially larger effects of small classes for lower achieving students...|$|R

50|$|Hekman {{and colleagues}} found that {{low levels of}} job embeddedness were contagious, {{spreading}} from coworker to coworker. Coworkers {{with low levels of}} job embeddedness influenced their coworkers to quit. There is some evidence for a <b>differential</b> <b>effect</b> of on-the-job versus off-the-job embeddedness on turnover. For example, Lee and colleagues found that off-the-job embeddedness predicted voluntary turnover and absenteeism, whereas on-the job embeddedness predicted organizational citizenship behavior and job performance. Off-the-job embeddedness may contribute to withdrawal because an individual who is greatly occupied by non-work obligations may have less time to devote to work. In contrast, Allen found that on-the-job embeddedness, but not off-the-job embeddedness, was negatively related to turnover (i.e. the higher employees are in on-the-job embeddedness, the less likely they are to quit).|$|E
