25|$|These views placed Pătrășcanu in {{opposition}} to other left-wing authors in Romania — namely, the influential Poporanists, most of whom had emphasized various contradictions between the Marxian model and local realities, using Junimea's theory as a <b>fundament</b> (aside from Pătrășcanu's own father, these included his contemporary Virgil Madgearu and, to a certain degree, the Marxist Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea). In parallel, Pătrășcanu's theories were in sharp contrast with those held by advocates of economic liberalism, and especially with Ștefan Zeletin's.|$|E

25|$|Following Wolfgang Dietrich, Wolfgang Sützl and the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies, {{some peace}} thinkers have {{abandoned}} any single and all-encompassing definition of peace.

This post-modern understanding of peace(s) was based on the philosophy of Jean Francois Lyotard. It served as a <b>fundament</b> for the more recent concept of trans-rational peace(s) and elicitive conflict transformation.|$|E

25|$|The first, which {{retained}} {{currency in}} Greek theological and mystical speculation until {{the dissolution of}} the empire, was the belief in the angelic transmission of sacred chant: the assumption that the early Church united men in the prayer of the angelic choirs. It was partly based on the Hebrew <b>fundament</b> of Christian worship, but in the particular reception of St. Basil of Caesarea's divine liturgy. John Chrysostom, since 397 Archbishop of Constantinople, abridged the long formular of Basil's divine liturgy for the local cathedral rite.|$|E
25|$|Conservation efforts {{began in}} the 1900s to save the cathedral from further damage. The {{correction}} of the Rhine river resulted in a lowering of the groundwater, the wooden substructures became rotten and the foundations started to fail {{and needed to be}} replaced. Beginning in 1909 the old foundations were underpinned. Works stopped in 1916 due to World War I. Between 1924 and 1928 the fundaments were completely reinforced by a new <b>fundament</b> made of concrete. Concrete and steel were used to anchor the towers and main vault.|$|E
25|$|Another {{practice}} {{was the use}} of pigeons when treating swellings. Swellings which were white in appearance and deep were unlikely to break and must be anointed with Oil of Lillies or Camomil. Once the swelling rises to a head and is red in appearance and not deep in the flesh, it can be broken {{with the use of a}} feather from a young pigeon's tail. The feather's <b>fundament</b> was held to the swelling and would draw out the venom. However, if the swelling dropped and became black in appearance since it had taken in coldness, the physician had to be cautious when drawing the cold from the swelling. If it was too late to prevent, the physician would take the young pigeon, cut her open from breast to back, break her open and apply the pigeon (while still alive) over the cold swelling. The cupping therapy was an alternative method which was heated and then placed over the swellings. Once the sore was broken, the physician would apply Mellilot Plaister with Linimentum Arcei and heal the sore with digence.|$|E

In practice, a new <b>fundament</b> to reigns in Moldavia was created by the Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829), and a period of Russian domination over the two countries which ended only in 1856: begun as a military occupation under the command of Pavel Kiselyov, Russian domination gave Wallachia and Moldavia, which were not removed from nominal Ottoman control, the modernizing Organic Statute (the first document resembling a constitution, as well as the first one to regard both principalities). After 1829, the country also became an important destination for immigration of Ashkenazi Jews from the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria and areas of Russia (see History of the Jews in Romania and Sudiți).|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1930s the Viennese Waltz had its comeback as a folk dance in Germany and Austria. The former military officer Karl von Mirkowitsch made it acceptable both for society and ballroom, and since 1932 the Viennese Waltz has been present on ballroom dance floors. About the same time, the Viennese Waltz had its comeback as a folk dance in The Greater Cleveland Ohio U.S.A. area, due to the population of Slovenians (60,000 - 80,000) settled in the area. [...] Slovenia, situated south of Austria, was influenced in its folk dance by the Viennese Waltz. Frankie Yankovic, a Slovenian from Cleveland Ohio traveled the world playing his version ("Cleveland Style" [...] as per Polka Hall of Fame, Euclid Ohio) of the Viennese Waltzes. His Blue Skirt Waltz went Platinum in 1949. Even today, there are many opportunities to waltz every week in The Greater Cleveland Area. In 1951, Paul Krebs, a dance teacher from Nürnberg, combined the traditional Austrian Waltz with the English style of waltzing and had great success at the dance festival in Blackpool in the same year. Since then the Viennese Waltz is one of the five International Standard ballroom dances; in 1963 it was added to the Welttanzprogramm which is the <b>fundament</b> of European dancing schools.|$|E
