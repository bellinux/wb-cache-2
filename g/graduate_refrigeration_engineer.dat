This further increased the weight {{and complexity of the}} modules, to the point where each one weighed about 15 lb. The external cooling system was considerably larger than the machine itself.|$|R

[...] Hertha Marks Ayrton (1854-1923), a British engineer and inventor who helped develop electric arc lighting, studied mathematics at Cambridge in 1880, but was denied a degree, as women were only granted certificates of completion at the time.

She obtained this degree in 1894, which means she may have been the first formally recognised female engineer in Europe.Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu (1887-1973) {{is one of the first}} formally recognised female engineers in Europe. Due to prejudices against women in the sciences, she was rejected by the School of Bridges and Roads in Bucharest, Romania.

Occupational safety and health concerns is a component of environmental justice. In surveys conducted of Vietnamese-American nail salon workers, many responses suggest that the work environment may be setting the space for negative health consequences. According to Standard 62-1989: Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Quality of the American Society for Heating, <b>Refrigeration,</b> Air Condiitoning <b>Engineers,</b> adequate supply of outdoor air should be about 20 cubic feet per minute per occupant. This necessitates multiple pathways for air to enter and exit the room. Such pathways include, but are not limited to windows and doors. However, the study showed that one-third of the surveyed shops had only one single door for ventilation with no secondary air pathway.|$|R
