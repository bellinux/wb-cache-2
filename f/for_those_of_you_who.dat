500|$|Fark tweaked {{its site}} design {{a little more}} on June 1, 2011, with the comment, [...] "Fark's {{redesign}} will go live at 5PM EST. Heads-up <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>who</b> missed the other warning threads and {{need a place to}} completely lose your mind." [...] Having learned from the controversy caused by the 2007 redesign, Curtis introduced the new site as a preview one week (two weeks for TotalFark users) prior to June 1, to allow users to comment on the changes and provide feedback on where things were broken. The primary reason for the redesigned site is {{to make it easier to}} use and more intuitive. The site's tagline was changed from [...] "It's not news, it's FARK" [...] to [...] "We don't make news. We mock it." [...] The music tab was also dropped, due to low usage – content was rolled into the Showbiz or Video tab, where most of the content was already cross-posted anyway. An overhaul to the Fark Mobile Web site was not done at this time, but Curtis did say that small changes would be implemented over time to make the mobile site more consistent with the overall design of the new site.|$|E

According to the press statement, [...] "it has become increasingly obvious that the direction {{and the needs of}} the band were in conflict, and this has led to a division from which we cannot recover". This announcement came days after Olzon fell ill at a show in Denver, Colorado and was unable to perform. Nightwish used replacement singers from the opening band, Kamelot, and Olzon later expressed her disappointment, saying [...] "I was never asked if it was OK that they used Elize and Alissa in the show [...] night [...] I don't think it's a good decision they made and I'm sorry <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>who</b> came to see the whole band but got something else.

Seriously, if you haven't {{had the time}} to tune in, I have changed my name to, well, my name. So many of you have e-mailed to say [...] "Hey Donna, it's about time!" [...] Well, fortunately the station thought so too. Tim and I have been married for more than five years, and I have been Deegan everywhere but on the air since then. So why now? Well, there is no great strategy here. For some time now the station has been putting together a new look for our news opens, graphics etc. That's a big deal and very expensive so it's not done very often. While making those plans they very graciously asked if I would like to change my on-air name. I talked it over with my kids and with Tim and everyone said [...] "go for it" [...] so I did. That simple. The decision {{had nothing to do with}} my recent recurrence. It will be fun to see if I can actually call myself the correct name every day. Between chemo and my normal space cadet nature, I think the betting pool is in full swing.|$|E

40|$|Ed Miliband {{tells us}} {{he wants to}} reward good {{families}} and firms. Where there are details, they raise as many questions as answers. Allocating housing {{on the basis of}} criteria other than needs throws up big questions. It's not clear to me why we want people to do apprenticeships in firms that have government contracts, etc. Stepping back from the details, Ed Milliband says that what they will do is change the regulatory and tax framework to carefully reward good firms. Fine in principle, but in practice I worry that this sort of thing vastly overestimates the ability of government to intervene in a way that actually achieves it's objectives. Two analogies spring to mind - one concerns the role of the Basel regulations on capital requirements that sought to ensure good behaviour but ended up encouraging banks to hold mortgage backed assets (and derivatives <b>of</b> <b>those</b> assets). The second is a little more in line with my expertise and concerns what policy might do to 'reward innovative firms located in clusters'. <b>For</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> that want the headline message - {{it turns out to be}} incredibly difficult to know what we should do (if anything) to reward innovative clusters <b>of</b> firms. <b>For</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> that like the details, read on for a more careful analysis (based on my contribution to the Manchester Independent Economic Review...|$|R

Assuming this is its aim, it succeeds admirably, for everyone who looks at it will find something of interest. However, considered as a whole, it is less successful. Even hardened fans of the World of Greyhawk fantasy setting may be disappointed as Greyhawk Adventures adds little to the background of Oerth, instead providing useful add-ons and enhancements. ... Don’t get me wrong—Greyhawk Adventures includes some very good material, and it's a useful purchase <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> looking <b>for</b> new spells, magical items, ways to make clerics more interesting, and for inspiration in the adventure department.
