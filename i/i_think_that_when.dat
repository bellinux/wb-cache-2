500|$|Darren and Nancy begin a {{relationship}} when Darren, Nancy and Nancy's housemates begin online dating in December 2010. Darren {{is due to}} go on a date he has arranged and Nancy comes to watch him, Darren's date does not arrive. As the evening continues, the pair realise there is an attraction between them and agree to go home together. Dawson said that the pair have [...] "always sort of hated each other" [...] as they are opposites, explaining that [...] "She's a feminist and he's a male chauvinist pig!" [...] He felt for the pair to begin {{a relationship}} is a [...] "case of opposites attracting - for some reason it works". Dawson added that through the pair's [...] "pompous ways" [...] they have both been through [...] "hard times and been through them with each other because they've known each other for so long". He commented that the pair have [...] "never seen eye-to-eye, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> they sit down and chat they realise they have a lot more in common than they think. In the past they just didn't want to accept that". E4 described the relationship this way: [...] "She's chalk and he's definitely more than a bit cheesy, but there you have it; Darren and Nancy (Dancy) are now officially an item! They’re the original odd-couple!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{described}} as an anti-war film, as civilians run and only try to save themselves and their family instead of fighting back against the alien Tripods. Debra J. Saunders of San Francisco Chronicle described the film as [...] "If aliens invade, don't fight back. Run." [...] Saunders compared the film to Independence Day, where the civilians do run, but they support the military efforts. Many reviewers considered the film tried to recreate {{the atmosphere of the}} September 11 attacks, with bystanders struggling to survive and the usage of missing-persons displays. Spielberg declared to Reader's Digest that beside the work being a fantasy, the threat represented was real: [...] "They are a wake-up call to face our fears as we confront a force intent on destroying our way of life." [...] Screenwriter David Koepp stated that he tried not to put explicit references to September 11 or the Iraq War, but said that the inspiration for the scene where Robbie joins the Marines was teenagers fighting in the Gaza Strip – [...] "I was thinking of teenagers in Gaza throwing bottles and rocks at tanks, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you're that age you don't fully consider the ramifications of what you're doing and you're very much caught up in the moment and passion, whether that's a good idea or not." [...] Retained from the novel is the aliens being defeated, not by men's weapons, but the planet's smallest creatures, bacteria, which Koepp described as [...] "nature, in a way, knowing a whole lot more than we do".|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to their outstanding success on the court, Gottlieb's 2012–13 California team became nationally known as a team that had fun, while also keeping focus. Senior leader Layshia Clarendon cut her hair into what became a trademark mohawk, and the team wrote, produced, and starred in their own music video, [...] "Started from the Bottom." [...] Coach Gottlieb explained: [...] "My philosophy in general is that college athletics should be an enjoyable experience for {{the people involved in}} it. I think you have to embrace this team's nature of being fun-loving. You have to empower them to enjoy the experience. I can do that because I'm so confident in their focus. They're creative, and they're smart kids. If anything, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> they're happier and enjoying it, they're more likely to play hard and play well." ...|$|E
5000|$|Regarding happenings, Red Grooms has remarked, [...] "I had {{the sense}} that I knew it was {{something}}. I knew it was something because I didn't know what it was. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> you're at your best point. When you're really doing something, you're doing it all out, but you don't know what it is." ...|$|R
50|$|Cronkite {{responded that}} a person should {{have a sense of}} curiosity. Ushery has said of the interview: “Many have asked if <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> the seed was planted for me to become a {{television}} reporter and anchor. I say, YES.” Connecticut audiences would see Ushery grow up on television. He hosted “Kidsworld” until he was 18.|$|R

6000|$|... "Certainly. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{they see}} the {{regiment}} marching along, and hear the bugles, they will clear out fast enough of their own accord." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not want}} to do that, {{as long as we can}} {{possibly}} stay here. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> night comes, we ought to make a sortie." ...|$|E
5000|$|Patricia's {{contribution}} Floodland wasn't directly musical. Which {{is not to}} say it wasn't important, {{because the}} look, the feel, the image, if you're in a pop group, is very important. It was an intriguing relationship that had a lot of value - probably more value than Andrew realized at first. And when he did realize it, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> he became very uneasy with Patricia. But her musical contributions were very minimal.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is <b>when</b> {{it should}} be strongest and clearest, <b>that</b> is <b>when</b> we should feel that {{whatever}} else is unreal and false, this is certain and true." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But then, father," [...] said Rollo, [...] "if {{this water}} all {{comes from the}} rain, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> it stops raining on the {{mountain}} above, then or soon afterwards the water would stop boiling up here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How may we {{overcome}} prejudice? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> we are prejudiced [...] {{against a}} person, {{it is the}} hardest {{thing in the world}} to overcome [...] it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it is a nasty place, that is all; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Sir John {{has seen}} it, {{he will tell}} you to keep quiet for a few days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} of my darter," [...] said Mrs. Banks, smoothing down her apron majestically. [...] "The arrangement was, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> they were, married they was to live with you?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Snider {{was raised}} in High Point, NC, where {{at the age of}} 10 he was {{introduced}} to racing by his cousin and occasional Sprint Cup Series driver Jay Hedgcock. He remembers spending time with Hedgcock, Jeff Burton, Kyle Petty and Phil Parsons during his summers. [...] "I would hang out in the garage, hand them wrenches and generally just get in the way," [...] Snider said. [...] "I remember hanging around from the time I was 10 to the time I was about fifteen years old. I would follow those guys around to all the races I could - <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> really fell in love with racing." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{newspaper}} was also criticized in 1996 for taking sides in a San Mateo County Board of Supervisors race, working to defeat incumbent Mary Griffin. Ted Fang denied the accusations {{that he was}} slanting his newspaper's coverage against Griffin, and said, [...] "I've expressed my personal opinion. That {{has nothing to do}} with editorial coverage." [...] Adding, regarding Griffin's refusal to be interviewed by editorial board of the Independent: [...] "Anytime a politician becomes so powerful they can choose which newspaper they want to talk to, or don't want to talk to, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> the citizens of the county should be afraid." ...|$|R
60|$|I incline to {{hold that}} Satchells was {{occasionally}} reminiscent of a ballad for the reasons and traces given, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Scott <b>when</b> his and Satchells' versions coincide, did not borrow direct from Satchells, but that both men had a ballad source.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a delicious}} soft wind!" [...] he exclaimed, {{removing}} his unsightly hat. [...] "Really, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{we get a}} sunny day like this, April is almost our most beautiful month." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} what, Capataz? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{the time comes}} and some {{information}} must be given, I shall indicate the Great Isabel. That {{is the best place}} I can think of. What is the matter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, Robert, I {{have been}} {{thinking}} {{so much about the}} future, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> we come back from our travels we ought to put aside almost all our money to do good with." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "When I {{was five}} <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> started {{wanting to be}} an actress. I loved to play. I didn't like the world around me because {{it was kind of}} grim, but I loved to play house. It was like you could make your own boundaries... <b>When</b> I heard <b>that</b> this was acting, I said that's what I want to be... Some of my foster {{families}} used to send me to the movies {{to get me out of}} the house and there I'd sit all day and way into the night. Up in front, there with the screen so big, a little kid all alone, and I loved it." [...] —Monroe in an interview for Life in 1962 ...|$|R
5000|$|Rachel Platten {{said of her}} inspiration: [...] "'Fight Song' was {{inspired}} by a lot of experiences that were hurting me and that were making me feel like maybe I didn’t have a chance in this industry. I wrote it because I needed to remind myself that I believed in myself. No matter what, I still was gonna make music, even if it was on a small scale. Even if it was just for me." [...] She also said: [...] "I really challenged myself in writing {{the past couple of years}} to be vulnerable in my lyrics. I didn’t want to skate past what was hurting. It didn’t scare me to be vulnerable because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> <b>when</b> you get something great." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1950s, Rutland {{realized}} that she was going blind. [...] "When you get incapacitated, and you can't see or can't move around as you should, then you're kind of at a loss," [...] she says. [...] "So you have to find something to do, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> found my writing."Rutland already sold writing to Redbook and other magazines. In 1964, she published a family memoir as a kind of antidote to the public fear about change and race — issues she was intimately familiar with as her own children attended newly integrated schools. In the book, The Trouble With Being a Mama, she wrote, [...] "Integration in theory is a fine, high-sounding utopia. In reality, I shivered as I watched my children unknowingly shed the warm cloak of segregation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot blame you," [...] {{said the}} officer. [...] "Yet <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{you know the}} truth {{you will see that}} I have done only that which I {{believed}} to be the duty of a patriotic officer and a true gentleman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I really don't {{think that}} you need be very anxious, Miss Thurwell," [...] he said hopefully. [...] "At present things look bad enough, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the time comes, I shall be able to throw a {{different}} light upon them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Ingleby contritely, with a {{trace of}} confusion. [...] "Certainly not. I would never have offered, only we are such old friends; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you brought that hat home after buying it you {{let me put it}} on for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|But a quick {{interrogative}} glance {{kept her}} silent. [...] "She {{was very small}} and delicate, and her father was impatient both of her weakness and mine. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> began to long for my mother. He made me call her Glykera, after his mother. I had taught him to be bitter against mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have some}} {{recollection}} of it," [...] I answered coldly. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> rumour exaggerates. <b>When</b> tongues wag, a little rivulet {{is often described}} as a mountain torrent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean to use no harsh word,--but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Kennedy <b>when</b> troubled in {{his spirit}} looks at things gloomily, and puts meaning upon words which {{they should not}} bear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait {{till you}} see him in uniform, Mabel," [...] Mr. Penfold went on. [...] "I am afraid that respect {{is one of the}} moral qualities in which you are deficient. Still <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you see Ralph in his uniform, you will be struck with awe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am engaged," [...] he continued, [...] "upon a {{study of}} the methods and habits of one whom I believe to be a great criminal. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I place my {{prisoner}} in the bar, Wainwright and these other great artists in crime will fade from the memory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} deny my faith, even {{to save my}} life, sir, if the {{question}} were put to me: 'Are you a Huguenot?' But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> four lives are at stake, it is lawful to take any opening there may be {{to get out of}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about <b>that.</b> <b>When</b> my Esther ventures to judge for herself, these prejudices will give way. She {{shall not be}} disobedient, but you will all {{perceive}} the uselessness of withholding my darling. Meanwhile, I only ask you to let me see her name from time to time. You won't deny me that?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Barry blamed his {{political}} legacy and grief over his father's {{death for the}} bank incident. [...] "You have people sometimes that {{take advantage of their}} positions. <b>I</b> just <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> she sees the name 'Marion Barry,' she for some reason doesn't like me." [...] Thinking back to the event, Barry said, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> had realized how much I was still mourning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How was <b>I</b> to <b>think</b> of <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was {{so frightened}} and {{confused}} that I didn't know where I {{was or what}} I was doing? There;--now I have told you everything." ...|$|R
