40|$|Mycopathogens of {{economically}} important exotic invasive {{insects in}} forests of northeastern USA {{have been the}} subject of research at the Entomology Research Laboratory, University of Vermont, for the last 20 years. Elongate hemlock scale, <b>European</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>lecanium,</b> hemlock woolly adelgid and pear thrips were analyzed for the presence of mycopathogens, in order to consider the potential for managing these pests with biological control. Fungal cultures isolated from insects with signs of fungal infection were identified based on morphological characters and DNA profiling. Mycopathogens recovered from infected insects were subdivided into three groups, i. e., specialized entomopathogenic; facultative entomopathogens; ubiquitous opportunistic contaminants. Epizootics were caused by fungi in the specialized group with the exception of M. microspora, P. marquandii and I. farinosa. Inoculation of insects in laboratory and field conditions with B. bassiana, L. muscarium and Myriangium sp. caused insect mortality of 45 to 95 %. Although pest populations in the field seemed severely compromised after treatment, the remnant populations re-established themselves after the winter. Although capable of inducing high mortality, a single localized aerial application of a soil-dwelling fungus does not maintain long-time suppression of pests. However, it can halt their range expansion and maintain populations below the economic threshold level without the use of expensive insecticides which have a negative impact on the environment...|$|E

40|$|<b>European</b> <b>fruit</b> tree canker, {{caused by}} Nectria galligena, {{is a major}} disease in organic apple cultivation. No copper {{can be used in}} Denmark and the Netherlands to control the disease. Removal of cankers is the only {{remaining}} method to control the disease. Slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) was applied at 50 or 100 kg/ha three times during the leaf fall period to protect apple trees against the disease. Experiments under high inoculum pressure showed a reduction in newly formed cankers of 57, 35 and 60 % with respect to untreated for 3 years respectively. The chemical standard thiophanate-methyl further reduced the number of newly formed cankers by 99, 60 and 89 % with respect to untreated for these 3 years respectively in these experiments. These results showed that slaked lime was less efficacious than the chemical standard under these high inoculum pressure circumstances. Demonstration experiments showed an efficacy of 70 and 68 % for slaked lime and 62 and 62 % for the conventional standard (carbendazim and captan) with respect to untreated controls in 2 years respectively. The demonstration experiments, done in commercial orchards and under normal inoculum pressure, showed a similar efficacy as the conventional standard.

40|$|<b>European</b> <b>fruit</b> tree canker, {{caused by}} Neonectria ditissima, is an {{important}} disease of pome fruit worldwide. Apple cultivars differ in their levels of susceptibility to N. ditissima. In order to design an effective plant resistance test, we examined the effectiveness of two resistance parameters: infection frequency and lesion growth. Both parameters were evaluated in parallel tests using 10 apple cultivars in three experimental years, applying seminatural infection of leaf scars (infection frequency) or inoculation of artificial wounds (lesion growth). We compared six parameters for lesion growth, of which a new parameter, lesion growth rate (LGR), {{appeared to be the}} best with respect to reproducibility and statistical significance. LGR is defined as the slope of the regression of lesion size versus time. The slope was estimated for each lesion, employing a common start date and a lesion-specific end date determined by the girdling of the lesion. The two parameters (infection frequency and LGR) were examined in separate experiments and in three successive years, and provided complementary information and resulted in reproducible conclusions on the relative resistance levels to N. ditissima of the tested cultivars. The presented methods can be used to develop strategies for the control of <b>European</b> <b>fruit</b> tree canker (e. g., in the breeding of new apple cultivars with high levels of resistance to N. ditissima) ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Growing {{demand in}} Europe for healthy and nutritious food and {{beverage}} products with new flavours creates opportunities for supplying the European market with novel fruit juices including tropical fruits like acai (Euterpe oleracea Mart.). Materials and methods. One tropical fruit species from Brazil, i. e., acai, was selected as a case species. Via expert interviews, a review of consumer studies regarding tropical fruit consumption, field visits and literature research, a SWOT analysis was conducted in order to map the opportunities, threats, strengths and weaknesses related to acai and its potential in the West <b>European</b> <b>fruit</b> juice industry. Results. Opportunities stem from growing consumer interest in natural, healthy and nutritious fruit juices, the need for health-oriented innovations in the food industry and growing interest in variety, novel tastes and ethnic foods. Unfamiliarity, health claim credibility and European market access requirements constitute the main threats. Strengths pertain to the nutritional value of acai and its tropical origin, {{and the existence of}} well-established national acai markets and processing industries. Weaknesses result from the irregular supply and inconsistent acai quality, lack of advanced know-how in cultivation and processing issues, and scant insights into the fruit's nutrient profile. Conclusion. The findings indicate that acai, which has outstanding nutritional values and health-related benefits, could have substantial potential in the West <b>European</b> <b>fruit</b> juice market. Key attention points pertain to creating awareness among consumers and building familiarity with acai and its products, and obtaining in-depth knowledge about its nutritional characteristics and concomitant health benefits...|$|R
