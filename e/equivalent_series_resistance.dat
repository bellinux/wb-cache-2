Pulsed alternators potentially have the same maintenance issues as other motor-generator sets, so a solid-state system would be desirable, but high voltage capacitor systems are not robust enough for the field. We propose here a Low Voltage Electrolytic Capacitor Pulse Forming Inductive Network (LVEC PFIN) which stores power in a relatively low voltage capacitor bank and provides weapon power pulses by first draining the capacitors into a power inductor and then interrupting the flow of current via a switch counterpulsing technique {{in order to achieve}} railgun-appropriate voltages. For this thesis, a 13 kJ LVEC PFIN was constructed, using solid-state semiconductor switches to redirect 25 kA of current into a 1 m. load, and the redirection of larger currents is clearly feasible.

Double-layer capacitors store charge at a liquid/solid interface, making them ideal for low temperature power applications, due to the facile kinetic processes associated with the rearrangement of the electrochemical double-layer at these temperatures. Potential low temperature applications include hybrid and electric vehicles, operations in polar regions, high altitude aircraft and aerospace avionics, and distributed environmental and structural health monitoring. State-of-the-art capacitors can typically operate to - 40 C, with a subsequent degradation in power performance below room temperature. However, recent efforts focused on advanced electrolyte and electrode systems can enable operation to temperatures as low as - 70 C, with capacities similar to room temperature values accompanied by reasonably low <b>equivalent</b> <b>series</b> <b>resistances.</b> This presentation will provide an overview of recent development efforts to extend and improve the wide temperature performance of these devices...|$|R

40|$|Development of safe, {{robust and}} {{reliable}} electrochemical energy conversion systems with high energy and power densities {{can be a}} response to the universal demand for a clean transport industry free from any fossil fuels derivatives. Electrochemical Double Layer Capacitors (EDLCs) are potential candidates that not only provide short pulses of energy at high powers but also deliver stable charge-discharge cycles in excess of 106 cycles. Correspondingly when used in conjugation with a battery stack in an electric vehicle can assist the battery when power boosts are required and therefore extending the battery lifetime. In literature studies these devices are commonly referred to as Electrochemical Capacitors (ECs) and supercapacitors. Commercially available EDLCs are based on aqueous or organic electrolytes that can safely operate in limited potentials. However the room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are promising alternatives to replace the current electrolytes as they demonstrate significantly higher and safer operating potentials, thus improving specific energy density. This study identified that the physiochemical properties, operating potential and the cation volume of the Ionic Liquids (ILs), as well as the pore size distribution of the carbon materials influencing the capacitance performance. Hence a systematic study of nine different ionic liquids with varying chain lengths and linkages from four classes of pyrrolidinium, sulfonium, ammonium and phosphonium RTILs was performed. The utilized IL cations in this study are the following: 1 -methyl- 1 - propylpyrrolidinium [Pyr 13], 1 -butyl- 1 -methylpyrrolidinium [Pyr 14], diethyl- methylsulfonium [S 221], triethylsulfonium [S 222], butyltrimethylammonium [N 1114], butyltriethylammonium [N 2224], N,N-diethyl-N-methyl-N-(2 methoxy- ethyl) ammonium [N 122 (2 O 1) ], pentyltriethylphosphonium [P 2225] and (2 methoxy- ethyl) triethylphosphonium [P 222 (2 O 1) ] that are combined with a bis(trifluoro- methane) sulfonimide [NTf 2] anion. The characterization of the utilized ILs was performed using Karl Fischer measurements, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, rheology, density and conductivity measurements and two/three electrode stability potential measurements. The effect of pore size distribution was also investigated by combining each liquid with four different activated carbons produced in-situ where the pore characteristics of the produced carbons was controlled with varying the precursors quantities. The temperature elevation approach was also used at 25 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C and 80 °C in order to study the effect of temperature on ILs physiochemical properties and capacitance response of the produced cells. The capacitance response was investigated with Galvanostatic cycling (GC) at a wide range of discharge densities. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was also used to determine the capacitance performance at 0. 01 Hz and monitor the solution, ionic and <b>equivalent</b> <b>series</b> <b>resistances</b> variation with pore size distribution and temperature. ...|$|R
25|$|All {{electrolytic}} capacitors with non-solid electrolyte age over time, due to evaporation of the electrolyte.

The normal lifespan of a non-solid electrolytic capacitor of consumer quality, typically rated at 2000h/85°C and operating at 40°C, is roughly 6 years. It {{can be more}} than 10 years for a 1000h/105°C capacitor operating at 40°C. Electrolytic capacitors that operate at a lower temperature can have a considerably longer lifespan.|$|E
25|$|Ripple {{current is}} the AC {{component}} of an applied source (often a switched-mode power supply) whose frequency may be constant or varying. Ripple current causes heat to be generated {{within the capacitor}} due to the dielectric losses caused by the changing field strength together with the current flow across the slightly resistive supply lines or the electrolyte in the capacitor.

25|$|The {{fill factor}} is {{the ratio of the}} actual maximum {{obtainable}} power to the product of the open circuit voltage and short circuit current. This is a key parameter in evaluating performance. In 2009, typical commercial solar cells had a fill factor > 0.70. Grade B cells were usually between 0.4 and 0.7. Cells with a high fill factor have a low <b>equivalent</b> <b>series</b> <b>resistance</b> and a high equivalent shunt resistance, so less of the current produced by the cell is dissipated in internal losses.|$|E
40|$|Double-layer {{capacitors}} {{are unique}} energy storage devices, capable of supporting large current pulses {{as well as}} a very high number of charging and discharging cycles. The performance of doublelayer capacitors is highly dependent {{on the nature of the}} electrolyte system used. Many applications, including for electric and fuel cell vehicles, back-up diesel generators, wind generator pitch control back-up power systems, environmental and structural distributed sensors, and spacecraft avionics, can potentially benefit from the use of double-layer capacitors with lower <b>equivalent</b> <b>series</b> <b>resistances</b> (ESRs) over wider temperature limits. Higher ESRs result in decreased power output, which is a particular problem at lower temperatures. Commercially available cells are typically rated for operation down to only 40 C. Previous briefs [for example, Low Temperature Supercapacitors (NPO- 44386), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 32, No. 7 (July 2008), p. 32, and Supercapacitor Electrolyte Solvents With Liquid Range Below 80 C (NPO- 44855), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 34, No. 1 (January 2010), p. 44] discussed the use of electrolytes that employed low-melting-point co-solvents to depress the freezing point of traditional acetonitrile-based electrolytes. Using these modified electrolyte formulations can extend the low-temperature operational limit of double-layer capacitors beyond that of commercially available cells. This previous work has shown that although the measured capacitance is relatively insensitive to temperature, the ESR can rise rapidly at low temperatures, due to decreased electrolyte conductance within the pores of the high surface- area carbon electrodes. Most of these advanced electrolyte systems featured tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEATFB) as the salt. More recent work at JPL indicates the use of the asymmetric quaternary ammonium salt triethylmethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEMATFB) or spiro-(l,l') -bipyrrolidium tetrafluoroborate (SBPBF 4) in a 1 : 1 by volume solvent mixture of acetonitrile (AN) and methyl formate (MF) enables double-layer capacitor cells to operate well below - 40 C with a relatively low ESR. Typically, a less than twofold increase in ESR is observed at - 65 C relative to room-temperature values, when these modified electrolyte blends are used in prototype cells. Double-layer capacitor coin cells filled with these electrolytes have displayed the lowest measured ESR for an organic electrolyte to date at low temperature (based on a wide range of electrolyte screening studies at JPL). The cells featured high-surface-area (approximately equal to 2, 500 m/g) carbon electrodes that were 0. 50 mm thick and 1. 6 cm in diameter, and coated with a thin layer of platinum to reduce cell resistance. A polyethylene separator was used to electrically isolate the electrodes...|$|R

Here, high <b>series</b> <b>resistance</b> effectively decouples segments furthest away from the probing point and subsequently results in a sharp drop in the ISC with increase in the <b>series</b> <b>resistance,</b> particularly in taller structures.

25|$|In contrast, {{electrochemical}} capacitors (supercapacitors) {{consists of}} two electrodes separated by an ion-permeable membrane (separator) and electrically connected via an electrolyte.

40|$|The {{calibration}} of {{photovoltaic devices}} requires {{the measurement of}} their current-voltage characteristics at Standard Test Conditions (STC). As the latter can only be reached approximately, a curve translation is necessary, requiring among others the internal <b>series</b> <b>resistance</b> of the photovoltaic device as an input parameter. Therefore accurate and reliable determination of the <b>series</b> <b>resistance</b> is important in measurement and test laboratories. This work follows standard IEC 60891 ed. 2 (2009) for {{the determination of the}} internal <b>series</b> <b>resistance</b> and investigates repeatability and uncertainty of the result in three aspects for a number of typical photovoltaic technologies. Firstly the effect of varying device temperature on the determined <b>series</b> <b>resistance</b> is determined experimentally and compared to a theoretical derivation showing agreement. It is found that the <b>series</b> <b>resistance</b> can be determined with an uncertainty of better than 5 % if the device temperature is stable within ± 0. 1 °C, whereas the temperature range of ± 2 °C allowed by the standard leads to much larger variations. Secondly the repeatability of the <b>series</b> <b>resistance</b> determination with respect to noise in current-voltage measurement is examined yielding typical values of ± 5 %. Thirdly the determination of the <b>series</b> <b>resistance</b> using three different experimental set-ups (solar simulators) shows agreement on the level of ± 5 % for crystalline Silicon photovoltaic devices and deviations up to 15 % for thin-film devices. It is concluded that the internal <b>series</b> <b>resistance</b> of photovoltaic devices could be determined with an uncertainty of better than 10 %. The influence of this uncertainty in <b>series</b> <b>resistance</b> on the electrical performance parameters of photovoltaic devices was estimated and showed a contribution of 0. 05 % for open-circuit voltage and 0. 1 % for maximum power.
