5|$|Humidity: Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{appears to}} require sustained, very high humidity. Active snails were found only when {{relative}} humidity approached 100 percent; during dry periods, snails {{were found to}} be relatively inactive. Portions of the habitat and substrate are consistently at near maximum humidity or saturation in the spray zone of the Falls. However, during 2002, the majority of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found >5m {{from the edge of the}} ledge nearest the Falls. Recent monitoring (prior to 2006) with temperature and humidity data loggers shows that these snails occur <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> the humidity generally varies from 80 to 100 percent during the active season. Further investigation is needed into seasonal and annual hydrological conditions within the Chittenango Creek watershed and at the Falls relative to the high-humidity areas used by Novisuccinea chittenangoensis.|$|E

5|$|I-96 {{passes through}} {{an area with}} several lakes as it crosses into Oakland County. This area {{includes}} the Island Lake State Recreation Area {{to the south and}} the Kensington Metropark {{to the north of the}} freeway <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> it crosses the Huron River. The Interstate runs through Wixom into Novi, where it passes to the south of the Twelve Oaks Mall. Southeast of the mall, I-96 enters a complex interchange on the border between Novi and Farmington Hills that connects it to M-5 (Haggerty Connector), I-275 and I-696 (Reuther Freeway). The trunkline drops a lane in each direction as it enters the interchange and turns southward. The freeway then merges into I-275 and increases to four lanes in each direction running south in Farmington Hills.|$|E
5|$|Just {{outside the}} Eastlake Estates, an honors {{ceremony}} {{was being held}} at Westmoore High School {{at the time of}} the tornado. Adequate warning time allowed those at the school to seek shelter, however, and more than 400 adults and children attending the awards ceremony at the school's auditorium were moved to the main building, sheltering in reinforced hallways and bathrooms. Ultimately, Westmoore High sustained heavy damage and dozens of cars in the parking lot were tossed around, some of which were completely destroyed or thrown into nearby homes. No injuries took place at the school, though a horse was found dead between a couple of destroyed cars in this area. The tornado proceeded through additional densely populated areas of Moore shortly thereafter, where several large groups of homes were flattened in residential areas, with a mixture of high-end F4 and low-end F5 damage noted. Near Janeway Avenue, four people were killed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> multiple homes were completely destroyed. A woman, who took shelter with her husband and two children, was also killed when she was blown out from under the Shields overpass on Interstate 35. The tornado weakened somewhat as it moved through the Highland Park neighborhood of Moore, but still caused widespread F3 and F4 damage.|$|E
5|$|Traditional desert farming {{systems have}} long been {{established}} in North Africa, irrigation being {{the key to success}} <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> water stress is a limiting factor to growth. Techniques that can be used include drip irrigation, the use of organic residues or animal manures as fertilisers and other traditional agricultural management practises. Once fertility has been built up, further crop production preserves the soil from destruction by wind and other forms of erosion. It has been found that plant growth-promoting bacteria play a role in increasing the resistance of plants to stress conditions and these rhizobacterial suspensions could be inoculated into the soil {{in the vicinity of the}} plants. A study of these microbes found that desert farming hampers desertification by establishing islands of fertility allowing farmers to achieve increased yields despite the adverse environmental conditions. A field trial in the Sonoran Desert which exposed the roots of different species of tree to rhizobacteria and the nitrogen fixing bacterium Azospirillum brasilense with the aim of restoring degraded lands was only partially successful.|$|E

5|$|Prior to enclosure, Low Fell was {{predominantly}} {{inhabited by}} {{a small number of}} tinkers and hawkers but after enclosure the character of the suburb changed rapidly as people moved to be close to the new turnpike road. Although neighbouring Sheriff Hill thrived through an influx of heavy industry, built upon a colliery and pottery particularly, by 1827 new allotment owners on Low Fell had spent heavily to improve land so that sod cottages were a rarity and the last remaining pit heaps had been removed. The result was that numerous wealthy individuals were drawn to the area and it was this influx which helped shape and grow the early settlement, as opposed to the more usual means of growth allied to work and industry. The 1880s were a decade of considerable building in the village, fueled by the completion of a tramway with nearby Gateshead in 1883 and this brought some light industry to the area; in the same year Mawson & Swan built their dry plate works in Kells Lane and this proved to be the first of several light industries to locate in that area. These smaller industries, allied to several farms in the Dryden Road area of the village (Dryden Farm, Orchard Cottage Dairy Farm and Derwent Crook Farm all survived in this area until the Second World War), generated a small economy <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> inhabitants had built and settled predominantly to escape the dirt and grime of industrial Tyneside.|$|E
