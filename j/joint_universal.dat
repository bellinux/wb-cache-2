For bounded distortion measures, it is shown that any compactly parametrized family of R d-valued i. i. d. sources with absolutely continuous distributions satisfying appropriate smoothness and Vapnik–Chervonenkis learnability conditions, admits a joint scheme for universal lossy block coding and parameter estimation, such that when the block length n tends to infinity, the overhead per-letter rate and the distortion redundancies converge to zero as O(n − 1 log n) and O (√ n − 1 log n), respectively, and the source in effect can be determined at the decoder up to a ball of radius O (√ n − 1 log n) in variational distance, asymptotically almost surely. The system has finite memory length equal to the block length, and {{can be thought of as}} blockwise application of a time-invariant nonlinear filter with initial conditions determined from the previous block. Comparisons are presented with several existing schemes for universal vector quantization, which do not include parameter estimation explicitly, and an extension to unbounded distortion measures is outlined.

If we adopt traditional methods to build the force and moment equilibrium equations of all movable bodies and complementary equations, the rank of the coefficient matrix of those equations will be very large. This method, {{which is based on}} resultant constraint wrenches, can avoid the high-rank matrix, reduce a certain number of unknowns, and ensure that the number of simultaneous equilibrium equations is not more than six each time. However, it is only suitable for solving the driving forces/torques and constraint forces/moments of passive overconstrained PMs with collinear constraint forces or coaxial constraint moments.|$|E
