40|$|With {{a view to}} {{facilitating the}} {{determination}} of the pressure line within the section of a debris dam, charts have been prepared which give the position of the pressure line in the base and top {{as well as in the}} joints through the points dividing the height of the dam into six equal parts. The distance of the point where the line cuts a horizontal section from the centre of the section is expressed in terms of the upstream batter and the respective ratios of the spillway width and overflow depth to the depth of the section below the spillway, the <b>downstream</b> <b>batter</b> being assumed 0. 2 : 1 and the specific weight of the masonry twice that of the overflowing water...|$|E
50|$|Undine, , and {{transports}} City of Pekin, Kenton, and Aurora left Clifton on 9 October on {{an expedition to}} capture Eastport, Mississippi. This operation was launched to prevent cavalry forces under Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest from crossing the Tennessee River at Eastport and to provide an outpost against an expected advance of General Hood. However, the Union force was ambushed by shore batteries on 10 October as it landed troops near Eastport. After a heated, 30-minute exchange with the batteries, Undine and Key West evacuated troops caught ashore in the withering crossfire and escorted the disabled transports back <b>downstream.</b> The <b>battered</b> expedition returned to Paducah, Kentucky, at sundown on 12 October.|$|R
40|$|A {{rainstorm}} on 27 – 28 May 2003 {{caused a}} debris slide in the fill batter of a recently constructed road crossing of a zero-order stream in Compartment 107, Chichester State Forest, Australia. The slide became more liquid downslope, changing to a debris flow. This flow completely blocked the inlet {{of the next}} downstream road crossing of the same stream, where it had changed to first order. Gullying of the <b>downstream</b> fill <b>batter</b> at the second crossing was caused by water flowing over the road. The estimated volume of sediment removed by the upslope debris slide was 350 [*]m³, and the estimated erosion volume by gullying of the <b>downstream</b> fill <b>batter</b> at the second crossing was 100 [*]m³. Mass movements have occurred in Compartment 107 before any forestry activities {{because of the presence}} of colluvium-filled bedrock depressions. Furthermore, the channel downstream of the second crossing has transported much larger quantities of coarser sediment than what was mobilized during and after the event of 27 – 28 May 2003. Channel bank exposures reveal up to 2. 5 -m-thick, poorly sorted gravels, which, on the basis of soil development in the overlying deposits, appear to be older than 200 [*]years. Sediment was deposited in the channel downstream of the second crossing, as determined using Munsell Soil Colour as a fingerprinting technique. The volumes involved were relatively minor and were only deposited in slackwater areas as spatially disjunct, relatively thin patches. Sediment was restricted to the first 500 [*]m downstream of the second crossing and was unlikely to have reached the main stream, Allyn River, in any measurable quantity. The channel downstream of the second road crossing is a high-energy feature because it contains a range of channel units (waterfalls, bedrock, boulder and log steps, cascades, etc.) formed by erosion of resistant materials. Similar and larger events to that of 27 – 28 May 2003 in the following 13 months did not cause further road erosion, indicating that the installed rehabilitation measures stabilized the road...|$|R
500|$|In {{arch dam}} design, two basic shapes are adopted. These are the constant–radius arch and the constant-angle arch, the latter design is more complex. In the constant-radius arch design, {{which is also}} known as the single-radius arch, the shape of the dam is {{cylindrical}} with vertical upstream face while the <b>downstream</b> face is <b>battered.</b> The constant-angle arch design has also a variable–radius arch. In this design, the central opening angle is constant whereas the arch radius increases from the base to the crest; this increase towards the crest is proportional to the increase of the canyon width of the gorge. Further, according to the theory of constant-arch design, the arch action {{at the base of the}} dam exerts the maximum pressure on the base. A [...] "V" [...] shaped gorge in particular is considered an ideal feature for building this type of dam. This design ensures substantial savings in use of construction material as opposed to the constant–radius arch design. Lars R. Jorgenson who had conceived this concept had proved that the most economic design of the dam was obtained with an optimum opening angle of 133.6°, with the least quantity of concrete. This design was applied with some modifications for the Salmon Creek Dam, which was designed with constant opening angle of 113° with radius varying from [...] at the base to [...] at the crest.|$|R
