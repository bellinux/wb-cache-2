5|$|Early {{forms of}} {{xylophone}} {{such as the}} atranatrana are found throughout the island and {{are believed to have}} come across with the original Indonesian settlers. The earliest of these is played uniquely by a pair of women, one of whom sits with <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> outstretched together and the bars of the xylophone resting across <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> rather than on a separate resonator box. Each woman strikes the atranatrana with a pair of sticks, one keeping the beat while the second plays a melody. The xylophone bars range from five to seven in number and are made of differing lengths of a rot-resistant wood called hazomalagny. A similar xylophone called katiboky is still played in the southwest among the Vezo and Bara ethnic groups.|$|E

While there, she became involved with, then married, one of the anarchists she met: Cornelius (Iwan) Dirk de Bruin. Soon after they were married, she said, de Bruin began to abuse her severely, punching and kicking her, burning her with cigarettes, beating her on <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> with a wooden beam, and banging {{her head against the}} floor until he knocked her unconscious.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Subhash Chandra Bose (Sriman) aka Subhash is a doctor, {{he first}} refuses to treat Manimekalai {{because it is}} an illegal matter. After seeing <b>her</b> <b>leg's</b> condition, he finally accepts to operate her but Manimekalai {{does not want to be}} amputed. It was a {{sensitive}} case, the doctors successfully operate <b>her</b> <b>leg</b> but it's only temporary. <b>Her</b> <b>leg</b> could be at anytime collapsed and she could died of it. Subhash doesn't understand why she risks her life for <b>her</b> <b>leg</b> and she tells him her past.|$|R
50|$|She {{suffered}} a wound in <b>her</b> <b>leg</b> {{in the spring}} of 2010. As the wound failed to respond to antibiotics, in July of that year <b>her</b> <b>leg</b> was amputated below the knee.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{version of}} the Clearly Impossible is without the box (No Box At All). This is done with {{deceptive}} table and a sliding mechanism. This is similar to buzz saw. First the assistant is placed on table and two metal covers are placed {{at the center of}} her body. By some means, magician covers <b>her</b> <b>leg.</b> A mechanism then inserts <b>her</b> <b>leg</b> inside the table and two complete false leg appears on the table and some electronic mechanism vibrates them. While <b>her</b> <b>leg</b> is inside the table, she pulls <b>her</b> <b>leg,</b> but not completely. A triangle type leg structure is formed. Now her body is cut by magician.|$|R
5|$|Despite her predicament, Sánchez {{remained}} relatively positive: she sang to Germán Santa María Barragán, {{a journalist who}} {{was working as a}} volunteer, asked for sweet food, drank soda, and agreed to be interviewed. At times, she was scared, and prayed or cried. On the third night, Sánchez began hallucinating, saying that {{she did not want to}} be late for school, and mentioned a maths exam. Near the end of her life, Sánchez's eyes reddened, her face swelled, and her hands whitened. At one point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest. Hours later the workers returned with a pump and tried to save her, but <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> were bent under the concrete as if she was kneeling, and it was impossible to free her without severing <b>her</b> <b>legs.</b> Lacking the surgical equipment to save her from the effects of an amputation, the doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die. In all, Sánchez suffered for nearly three nights (roughly 60 hours) before she died at approximately 10:05 A.M. on November 16 from exposure, most likely from gangrene or hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by {{concrete}} but got her hand {{through a crack in}} the debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood {{over the course of a}} day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> and feet.|$|E
5|$|Maya Lindholm {{was born}} in Hamburg on 20 December 1990.

At the 2012 Olympics, Mortimer's four medals were the most for any Canadian athlete or para-athlete.|$|E
5|$|David {{made several}} visits to California, which she much enjoyed, but her health began to fail.

She became increasingly reclusive but, despite spending periods in bed at home, she continued to work on Ice and Ices. She realised {{that she would not}} be able to finish the work, and asked Norman to complete it for her. It was published in 1994, under the title Harvest of the Cold Months.|$|E

5|$|In The Girlie Show in 1993, {{the song}} was {{performed}} in an alternate version as the second to last song of the tour. It had a military theme to it. Halfway through the performance Madonna paused the song for a military drill with the dancers and the audience. The performance met with strong reaction in Puerto Rico, when Madonna rubbed the Puerto Rican national flag between <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> in between the performance. For the Drowned World Tour in 2001 Madonna wore a fur coat, velvet fedora and a customised Dolce & Gabbana T-shirt which proclaimed 'Mother' {{in the front and}} 'F*cker' in the back painted in silver. This demonstrated her ghetto-girl appearance adopted for the song's performance.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{has started}} {{spending}} more time with Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) because Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) keeps trying to rope Jim into having an affair. During the night at the hotel, Cathy asks to hang out for a while in Jim's room under the pretext that the heat in her room is malfunctioning. She repeatedly makes seductive signals, making Jim uncomfortable, so he calls Dwight saying he has bed bugs. Dwight arrives and forces Cathy off Jim's bed so he can lure out the bed bugs with his nearly naked body. This fails to sufficiently disgust Cathy, who merely steps into the bathroom to take a shower until Dwight leaves. Cathy gets out of the shower wearing only a bath robe. After ordering some desserts from room service and asking Jim to touch <b>her</b> <b>legs,</b> he finally comes out saying that he is happily married, and {{does not want to be}} with her.
