5000|$|The CATS had <b>diversion</b> <b>curve</b> {{techniques}} {{available and}} used them for some tasks. At first, the CATS studied the diversion of auto traffic from streets and arterial roads to proposed expressways. Diversion curves were also used for bypasses built around cities {{to find out what}} percent of traffic would use the bypass. The mode choice version of <b>diversion</b> <b>curve</b> analysis proceeds this way: one forms a ratio, say: ...|$|E
5000|$|In a sense, <b>diversion</b> <b>curve</b> {{analysis}} is expert system analysis. Planners could [...] "eyeball" [...] neighborhoods and estimate transit ridership by routes {{and time of}} day. Instead, diversion is observed empirically and charts drawn.|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} work two trips are considered namely House hold trip and Commercial trip. A house hold trip {{is a person}} trip or auto driver trips made by residents within a specified area and for defined purposes, while a commercials trip is a trip made by the commercial vehicles within a specified area and for a defined purpose. Normally, surveys of commercial vehicle are carried out in conjunctions with the home-interview study. If the complete pattern of travel within the survey areas is desired, {{this phase of the}} survey must be carried out with the same care as, and {{in a manner similar to}} the home interview study. In this case planners may collect extensive data on socio-economic characteristics of house hold and relate such information of house hold travel. To collect data a kind of survey is carry out, which includes home interview, telephone, and mail survey. The home interview method involves identifying a sample of all of the households within the area, arranging for interviews, and questioning respondents about trips made by person in their respective households the previous day, such relationships are extremely valuable for making forecasts of future travel by person who reside in the study area. In the causes of study, data was collected through the form of verbal interview and by passing questionnaires to the various household in the study area. Traffic assignment is the stage in transportation planning process where in the trip; inter-changes are allocated, to different part of network forming the transportation system. The traffic assignments help to reduce the time consumption for car drivers. In the research work a value was test to verify the model equation for the traffic assignment method. From the calculation, by <b>diversion</b> <b>curve</b> method, the traffic reduced from 445 vehicle/h from modugani through Monday market to Bama road, reduced to 361 vehicle/h through kyarami to Bama road with the reduction of total number of 84 vehicle/h...|$|E
50|$|<b>Diversion</b> <b>curves</b> {{are based}} on {{empirical}} observations, and their improvement has resulted from better (more and more pointed) data. Curves are available for many markets. It {{is not difficult to}} obtain data and array results. Expansion of transit has motivated data development by operators and planners. Yacov Zahavi’s UMOT studies, discussed earlier, contain many examples of <b>diversion</b> <b>curves.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS) {{researchers}} developed <b>diversion</b> <b>curves</b> for freeways versus local streets. There {{was much}} work in California also, for California had early experiences with freeway planning. In addition to {{work of a}} diversion sort, the CATS attacked some technical problems that arise when one works with complex networks. One result was the Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm for finding shortest paths on networks.|$|R
50|$|Given the R {{that we have}} calculated, {{the graph}} tells us the percent of users in the market that will choose transit. A {{variation}} on the technique is to use costs rather than time in the diversion ratio. The decision to use a time or cost ratio turns on the problem at hand. Transit agencies developed <b>diversion</b> <b>curves</b> for different kinds of situations, so variables like income and population density entered implicitly.|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{structure}} is designed based on hydraulic theories or guidelines. To ensure performance, physical model tests {{are often used}} at high discharges. However, high discharge in river is rare. Physical model tests at high discharges will probably lead biased hydrological relationship. To improve hydrological relationship at low discharges, in this study, we considered the <b>diversion</b> rating <b>curve</b> of the Yuanshanzi Diversion Work. The 1 / 100 -scaled physical model tests at low and high discharges (90 - 1620 m 3 /s) were performed and coupled the diversion discharges of 5 flood events (2009 - 2010) in field. The official <b>diversion</b> rating <b>curve</b> was built only based on physical model tests at high discharges (837 - 1620 m 3 /s). The results of physical model tests in this study suggested the official <b>diversion</b> rating <b>curve</b> should be modified considering all tests. The modifi-cations showed the official <b>diversion</b> rating <b>curve</b> was over-estimated. A complete series of physi-cal model tests and considering field situations, in this study, indicated expanded physical model tests and constantly field measurements were therefore necessary for hydraulic structure, which provided information to modify used hydrological relationship to fit real situations...|$|R
50|$|One {{reason for}} rapid model {{development}} was a felt need. Systems were being proposed (especially transit systems) where no empirical {{experience of the}} type used in <b>diversion</b> <b>curves</b> was available. Choice models permit comparison {{of more than two}} alternatives and the importance of attributes of alternatives. There was the general desire for an analysis technique that depended less on aggregate analysis and with a greater behavioral content. And there was attraction, too, because choice models have logical and behavioral roots extended back to the 1920s as well as roots in Kelvin Lancaster’s consumer behavior theory, in utility theory, and in modern statistical methods.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} new storage {{allocation}} rule based on target storage curves. Joint operating rules are also proposed {{to solve the}} operation problems of a multi-reservoir system with joint demands and water transfer-supply projects. The joint operating rules include a water diversion rule to {{determine the amount of}} diverted water in a period, a hedging rule based on an aggregated reservoir to determine the total release from the system, and a storage allocation rule to specify the release from each reservoir. A simulation-optimization model was established to optimize the key points of the water <b>diversion</b> <b>curves,</b> the hedging rule curves, and the target storage curves using the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm. The multi-reservoir water supply system located in Liaoning Province, China, including a water transfer-supply project, was employed as a case study to verify the effectiveness of the proposed join operating rules and target storage curves. The results indicate that the proposed operating rules are suitable for the complex system. The storage allocation rule based on target storage curves shows an improved performance with regard to system storage distribution...|$|R
50|$|From the south, LA 109 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 90 and LA 3112 in Toomey, southwest of Vinton. From this four-way intersection, US 90 heads east toward Vinton and south {{a short distance}} to I-10 (Exit 4), {{at which point the}} two highways proceed west in a concurrency across the state line into Orange, Texas. Meanwhile, LA 109 proceeds due north, immediately crossing the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) tracks, for 2.5 mi and intersects LA 3063, which heads east to the Delta Downs Race Track and ultimately into Vinton. Continuing north for 4.2 mi, LA 109 crosses the Sabine River <b>Diversion</b> System and <b>curves</b> slightly to the northwest for about the same distance to reach the community of Starks. Here LA 109 crosses the Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS) tracks and intersects LA 12 a short distance later. LA 12 heads into Texas on the west and DeQuincy on the northeast. LA 109 then proceeds due north for 5.8 mi and crosses from Calcasieu Parish into Beauregard Parish.|$|R
2500|$|North of Lincoln, the A15 enters West Lindsey, {{and meets}} {{the start of}} the A158 at a roundabout, then runs {{concurrently}} with the A46 to the Riseholme roundabout, where it briefly re-enters the Borough of Lincoln, then follows the Roman road Ermine Street past the Riseholme College of Agriculture on the right, now part of the University of Lincoln, and Lincolnshire Showground to the left. At the end of a [...] section is the Tillbridge Lane roundabout with the A1500, for Gainsborough. From here, it used to be straight, but with RAF Scampton becoming a base for V bombers in the 1950s, the runway had to be extended and the road now has a <b>curved</b> <b>diversion</b> to the east. It passes the Scampton primary school and continues past a right turn to Normanby by Spital, on its most straight section, also the parish boundary of many local villages. At the roundabout with the A631 at Caenby Corner, there is the Total Caenby Corner Garage just south of Spital-in-the-Street. Overtaking is difficult as the road, although straight, is undulating with unmarked dips and slow moving farm traffic. There are two right turns for Bishop Norton and Atterby. There is a right turn for Snitterby and a left turn for Blyborough. At the B1205 staggered crossroads (for Waddingham to the east, and Grayingham to the west), it enters North Lincolnshire.|$|R
40|$|Utilization time {{of maximum}} power losses (UTL) {{has been applied}} for {{determination}} of energy losses in power grids. UTL is a parameter allowing for accurate estimation of energy losses. Using the maximum load time for UTL determination, better results {{can be achieved by}} decomposing the load duration graph (LDG) into two parts: the base and the delta ones. Bearing in mind that the latter occupies a smaller area of the entire LDG, the goal is achieved, since the errors can be caused only by the inaccuracy of delta part calculation. Based on this method it is possible to calculate UTL directly from the load graph and to achieve the same accuracy as with the classical method and with the smaller number of load measurements needed. By modifying this method once again, we can estimate UTL from the load graph based on its bearing points which are bending and flex points of the load time curve. The load time graph is decomposed into columns, each of them being contained between two neighboring bearing points. The UTL of each column is calculated to obtain the total UTL, which is the sought for value. The UTL of a column takes into account the minimum load value within the column, the maximum load time and the UTL of its upper part, both of the last quantities depending on the degree of the load <b>curve</b> <b>diversion</b> from a straight line...|$|R
