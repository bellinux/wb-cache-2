5|$|The {{detailed}} {{causes of}} the debt crisis varied. In several countries, private debts arising from a property bubble were transferred to sovereign debt {{as a result of}} banking system bailouts and government responses to slowing economies post-bubble. The structure of the eurozone as a currency union (i.e., one currency) without <b>fiscal</b> <b>union</b> (e.g., different tax and public pension rules) contributed to the crisis and limited the ability of European leaders to respond.

25|$|One {{theory is}} that these {{problems}} are caused by a structural contradiction within the euro system, the {{theory is that}} there is a monetary union (common currency) without a <b>fiscal</b> <b>union</b> (e.g., common taxation, pension, and treasury functions). In the Eurozone system, the countries are required to follow a similar fiscal path, but they do not have common treasury to enforce it. That is, countries with the same monetary system have freedom in fiscal policies in taxation and expenditure. So, even though there are some agreements on monetary policy and through the European Central Bank, countries may not be able to or would simply choose not to follow it. This feature brought fiscal free riding of peripheral economies, especially represented by Greece, as it is hard to control and regulate national financial institutions. Furthermore, there is also a problem that the Eurozone system has a difficult structure for quick response. Eurozone, having 18 nations as its members, require unanimous agreement for a decision making process. This would lead to failure in complete prevention of contagion of other areas, as it would be hard for the Eurozone to respond quickly to the problem.|$|E

Increased European integration giving a central body increased control over the budgets of member states was proposed on 14 June 2012 by Jens Weidmann President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, expanding on ideas first proposed by Jean-Claude Trichet, {{former president of the}} European Central Bank. Control, including requirements that taxes be raised or budgets cut, would be exercised only when fiscal imbalances developed.

Are {{we better}} together? Versions of this {{question}} have been heard repeatedly around Europe on {{the aftermath of the}} Great Recession. On the Eurozone, the suboptimal design of the monetary union has contributed to create imbalances before the crisis and slow recoveries after it. Meanwhile, tensions within <b>fiscal</b> <b>unions,</b> like the cases of Scotland in Great Britain or Catalonia in Spain, are arising. On this thesis, I discuss three topics on monetary and <b>fiscal</b> <b>unions.</b> The first chapter examines the effect of monetary unions on the competitiveness of its members. In this paper, I explore the effect of the robust increase in public wages following the introduction of the Euro on the overall loss of competitiveness of the economies of southern Europe during the past decade. To that end, I simulate the drop on interest rates (risk premium) that these countries experienced just before the introduction of the common currency within a DGSE model with search and matching frictions and two sectors. I find that around 15 % of the total increase in private wages during the 1999 - 2007 period {{can be attributed to the}} public wage channel. Then, I turn my attention to <b>fiscal</b> <b>unions.</b> The second paper, joint with Reinhard Ellwanger, explores the relationship between fiscal decentralization and fiscal policy effects. We document a positive relationship between decentralization and the effectiveness of fiscal policy: on average, spending and in particular revenue multipliers tend to be larger in more decentralized countries. The second part of the paper includes a case study for the decentralization process in Spain. Using the narrative approach, we find that shocks to decentralization have a positive impact on subsequent output growth, particularly for the decentralization of direct taxation competences. Finally, the third chapter explores the relation between the degree of decentralization of a country and its level of debt. Contrary to the current literature and the prevailing public opinion, a panel data analysis of 31 European countries over a 12 year period shows higher levels of regional decentralization have no effect on the levels of debt, even though it affects their spending and taxation income...|$|R

50|$|It {{is often}} {{proposed}} that the European Union should adopt a form of <b>fiscal</b> <b>union.</b> Most member states of the EU participate in economic and monetary union (EMU), based on the euro currency, but most decisions about taxes and spending remain at the national level.

40|$|This study grounds the {{establishment}} of EMU and the euro {{in the context of}} the history of international monetary cooperation and of monetary unions, above all in the U. S., Germany and Italy. The purpose of national monetary unions was to reduce transactions costs of multiple currencies and thereby facilitate commerce; to reduce exchange rate volatility; and to prevent wasteful competition for seigniorage. By contrast, supranational unions, such as the Latin Monetary Union or the Scandinavian Currency Union were conducted in the broader setting of an international monetary order, the gold standard. There are closer parallels between EMU and national monetary unions. Historical monetary unions also were associated with <b>fiscal</b> <b>unions</b> (<b>fiscal</b> federalism). Both <b>fiscal</b> and monetary <b>unions</b> were an important part of the process of political unification. In the past, central banks, and the currencies they managed, have been discredited or put under severe strain as a result of: severe or endemic fiscal problems creating pressures for the monetization of public debt; low economic growth may produce demands for central banks to pursue more expansionary policies; regional strains producing a demand for different monetary policies to adjust to particular regional pressures; severe crises of the financial system; and tensions between the international and the domestic role of a leading currency. In particular, there is the possibility for the EMU that low rates of growth will produce direct challenges to the management of the currency, and a demand for a more politically controlled and for a more expansive monetary policy. Such demands might arise in some parts or regions or countries of the euro area, but not in others and would lead to a politically highly difficult discussion of monetary governance. ...|$|R

The vehicle of analysis is a medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model consisting of two heterogeneous countries. The model is solved using data from Germany and Italy. Our solutions imply that a switch to flexible exchange rates and independent monetary policies would have negligible welfare implications. A similar result applies when we add interregional fiscal tranfers as insurance.
