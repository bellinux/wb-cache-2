5|$|All {{thirteen}} known Ruisdael etchings {{come from}} his early period, {{with the first}} one dated 1646. It is unknown who taught him the art of <b>etching.</b> No etchings exist signed by his father, his uncle, or his fellow Haarlem landscapist Cornelis Vroom, who influenced his other work. His etchings show little influence from Rembrandt, either in style or technique. Few original impressions exist; five etchings survive in only a single impression. The rarity of prints suggests that Ruisdael considered them trial essays, which did not warrant large editions. The <b>etching</b> expert Georges Duplessis singled out Grainfield at the Edge of a Wood and The Travellers as unrivalled illustrations of Ruisdael's genius.|$|E
5|$|Born in Saint Petersburg into {{a family}} with German-Jewish roots whose {{professionals}} included merchants, doctors, composers and academics, Simonovich-Efimova was highly educated, spending almost two decades studying art in both Russia and Paris to perfect her craft. Skilled in <b>etching,</b> watercolor and oil painting, she helped revive silhouette art in 20th-century Russia.|$|E
50|$|In the 1650s, Nooms made {{a series}} of <b>etchings</b> of ships and {{topographical}} views characterized by a high degree of detail and precision. These <b>etchings</b> served as an example to many artists. The 19th century French etcher Charles Méryon was highly influenced by Nooms, whose <b>etchings</b> of Paris cityscapes inspired Méryon to his own series of Paris <b>etchings.</b> Méryon even dedicated some of this work to Nooms in poetic form.|$|R

5|$|Capacitively coupled plasma (CCP): {{similar to}} glow {{discharge}} plasmas, but generated with high frequency RF electric fields, typically 13.56 MHz. These differ from glow discharges {{in that the}} sheaths are much less intense. These are widely used in the microfabrication and integrated circuit manufacturing industries for plasma <b>etching</b> and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} sizable {{temperature}} and density ranges, plasmas find applications in many fields of research, technology and industry. For example, in: industrial and extractive metallurgy, surface treatments such as plasma spraying (coating), <b>etching</b> in microelectronics, metal cutting and welding; {{as well as}} in everyday vehicle exhaust cleanup and fluorescent/luminescent lamps, while even playing a part in supersonic combustion engines for aerospace engineering.|$|E
50|$|New {{technology}} {{introduced in}} 1820 allowed more books to be produced. Publication of annuals with <b>etchings</b> of beautiful women was a fad that lasted from 1823 to 1857, and Mote was a prolific engraver of this content. In the 1830s the <b>etchings</b> became popular as watercolor projects, {{and many people}} turned <b>etchings</b> into wall art.|$|R

5|$|Electron-beam {{lithography}} (EBL) is {{a method}} of <b>etching</b> semiconductors at resolutions smaller than a micrometer. This technique is limited by high costs, slow performance, the need to operate the beam in the vacuum and the tendency of the electrons to scatter in solids. The last problem limits the resolution to about 10nm. For this reason, EBL is primarily used {{for the production of}} small numbers of specialized integrated circuits.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Jake and Dinos Chapman of the Young British Artists {{movement}} created 82 miniature, toy-like sculptures modelled on The Disasters of War.

In the same year, these last <b>etchings</b> were acquired by the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome. His <b>etchings</b> were innovative in their technique and composition.|$|R
50|$|Octave de Rochebrune (1824-1900) was a French painter, {{sculptor}} and etcher. He did 492 <b>etchings,</b> including <b>etchings</b> of the Château de Blois, the Château de Chambord and the Château de Vitré.|$|R
5|$|The {{positive}} charge in ions {{is achieved by}} stripping away electrons from atomic nuclei. The number of electrons removed is related to either the increase in temperature or the local density of other ionised matter. This also can be accompanied by the dissociation of molecular bonds, though this process is distinctly different from chemical processes of ion interactions in liquids or the behavior of ions existing in metals. The response of plasma to electromagnetic fields can be usefully employed in many modern technological devices, such as plasma televisions or plasma <b>etching.</b>|$|E

5|$|Wintjiya's {{involvement}} in contemporary Indigenous Australian art began in 1994 at Haasts Bluff, when she {{participated in a}} group painting project and {{in the creation of}} batik fabrics. She has also been a printmaker, using drypoint <b>etching.</b> Her paintings typically use an iconography that represents the eggs of the flying ant (waturnuma) and hair-string skirts (nyimparra). Her palette generally involves strong red or black against a white background.|$|E

25|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, {{artists such as}} Hale were {{instrumental}} in reviving <b>etching</b> in America and Europe and restoring {{the significance of this}} technical medium. At the forefront of the <b>Etching</b> Revival of Hale's time was artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler, who set the standard for new generation of etchers. Clements first introduced Hale to <b>etching</b> while the pair was traveling in Europe. In terms of the <b>etching</b> process, Hale, like her contemporaries, used copper plates to produce clean, well-defined impressions. Hale experimented with a variety of <b>etching</b> techniques, including hard-ground, soft-ground, aquatint, and color inking. In the <b>etching</b> medium, Hale worked on a more intimate basis, using etchings to document her travels through the U.S., Europe, and the Middle East. Some of Hale’s most accomplished prints include The Willow Whistle, which was produced using hard-ground <b>etching</b> and displayed at the Paris Salon, and First Night in Venice, which used the soft-ground process.|$|E
25|$|An <b>etching</b> of this period, “A View of Sievering”, {{gave him}} his first {{recognition}} in the United States as it {{was included in the}} 4th International Exhibition of <b>Etching</b> and Engraving at the Chicago Art Institute. It later toured the country in a museum exhibition of the nation’s best <b>etching.</b> In Austria he acquired an avid collector in Dr. Fritz Eisenberger, an art historian, who bought some twenty watercolors and one or more copies of all the <b>etching</b> Mestler produced in Austria. He had a one-man show in Vienna in 1936.|$|E
25|$|Undercuts from <b>etching</b> are {{somewhat}} {{different than the}} undercuts explained above, {{because it is a}} side effect, not an intentional feature. Undercuts from <b>etching</b> can occur from two common causes. The first is over <b>etching,</b> which means the etchant was applied too long. The second is due to an isotropic etchant, which means the etchant etches in all directions equally. To overcome this problem an anisotropic etchant is used.|$|E
