5|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Eva {{lives in}} the provincial town of Junín, and longs <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>life</b> in Buenos Aires. She persuades a tango singer, Agustín Magaldi, with whom she is having an affair, {{to take her to}} the city. After Magaldi leaves her, she goes through several {{relationships}} with increasingly influential men, becoming a model, actress and radio personality. She meets Colonel Juan Perón at a fundraiser following the 1944 San Juan earthquake. Perón's connection with Eva adds to his populist image, since they are both from the working class. Eva has a radio show during Perón's rise and uses all of her skills to promote him, even when the controlling administration has him jailed in an attempt to stunt his political momentum. The groundswell of support that Eva generates forces the government to release Perón, and he finds the people enamored of him and Eva. Perón wins election to the presidency and marries Eva, who promises that the new government will serve the descamisados.|$|E

5|$|It is {{announced}} {{that there will}} be an Itchy & Scratchy Movie and in anticipation, Bart buys himself a ticket. Later on, Bart is left to babysit Maggie and he neglects to watch her as he is distracted by the history of Itchy & Scratchy, leaving her to take Homer's car for a joyride and crash into the wall of Springfield Prison, releasing the prisoners. Therefore, Homer angrily blames Bart and punishes him by banning him from ever seeing The Itchy & Scratchy Movie. He tears up Bart's ticket to prove that he means business. Bart begs to be given another punishment, but Homer refuses. After the film's release, Bart becomes angry and sad that he is the only kid in Springfield who has not seen it. Two months later, the film is still being shown in theaters as Marge and Lisa beg Homer to change his mind, with Marge claiming Bart has been punished enough. However, Homer still denies this and makes the punishment stick. Bart attempts to secretly watch the film by paying for a ticket, but learns that Homer went to the theater and instructed the employees to not sell tickets to him. Eventually, the film is removed from theaters and Bart tells Homer he won, to which Homer replies by saying they both won because by using his punishment Bart is in no doubt headed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E

With this effort one can fight against injustice and dictatorship <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>life</b> for all people. This will first fix the problem with communication between people and second the social injustices develop a populous sense against the Shah in Iran and the world, and a dictator regime would fall.|$|E

25|$|Life in the Iron Mills {{is set in}} a {{small village}} whose center is {{industrial}} work, especially that of the iron mills. It is described as a polluted and oppressive village, inhabited by laborers, mostly “masses of men, with dull, besotted faces bent to the ground, sharpened here and there by pain or cunning; skin and muscle and flesh begrimed with smoke and ashes”. The novella's protagonist is Hugh Wolfe, an iron mill laborer who possesses artistic talent and a spiritual desire for higher forms of pleasure and fulfillment. Despite the hopefulness of Wolfe’s artistic drive, he becomes the story's tragic hero, as his yearning <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>life</b> leads to his imprisonment and ultimate death.|$|E
25|$|In 1885 {{the family}} left Arvier {{to work on}} the other side of the Alps, as most Valdotainians did at that time. The wish <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>life</b> is a likely {{explanation}} but does not suggest why they travelled so far, almost to the Belgian border. Speculation surrounds the move, possibly because it was in secret. To emigrate needed authority and mayors had been told by the sub-prefect of Aoste to refuse or at least make permission difficult. If the family travelled separately, it would explain the legend that Maurice, then 14, was exchanged for a round of cheese: it could have been payment to a guide to lead him clandestinely over the mountains or payment in return for custody of the son.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} slogan campaigns for Bull Durham was the “Roll Your Own” campaign.

This advertisement campaign originally had doubters, yet quickly these doubts were taken away when sales exploded. The ads made many in the middle and lower class want to go out to buy Bull Durham in order to emulate the upper class. The campaign was tremendously successful, using the desire <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>life</b> to boost sales.|$|E

25|$|The {{theme of}} power is also central.

There is energy, power and courage in the struggle <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>life</b> by Milton's residents. Margaret demonstrates power in her verbal jousting with Thornton, forcing him to reflect on the validity of his beliefs (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 15) and eventually change his view of workers from mere providers of labour to individuals capable of intelligent thought. When she reaches age 21 Margaret takes control of her life, resolves to live as she chooses and learns how to manage wealth inherited from Mr. Bell.|$|E

Brice Ezell from PopMatters wrote that it denotes [...] "the vital {{midpoint}} of the overarching narrative", where [...] "the wittier tone of the record's front half gives way to an emotionally dense second half." [...] Veering from synth-funk to slow jam styles, the song has a lyrical conceit that uses Ancient Egyptian and Biblical imagery, and contrasts the legendary fall of Cleopatra with the circumstances of a latter-day working girl, who dances at a strip club called the Pyramid to support her man's gaudy aspirations. The new wave-styled [...] "Lost" [...] is about a perplexed addict, who hopes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>life</b> {{for him and his}} drug-cooking girlfriend. [...] "Monks", a funk rock song, is about finding nirvana and deals with topics such as casual sex and devout religion in a narrative that shifts from an exciting concert to a metaphorical jungle. [...] "Bad Religion" [...] features melodramatic, orchestral music and a series of figures, including strings, handclaps, marching band snare drums, and mournful organ chords. The lyrics follow an emotional confession to a taxi driver by a narrator brooding over a secretive intimate relationship. Music journalist Alexis Petridis asserted that the song [...] "repurpos the battle between religion and lust that's been at the heart of soul music since it ceded from gospel".|$|E
