40|$|Abstract—Digital <b>fingerprinting</b> protects {{multimedia}} content from illegal redistribution by uniquely marking every {{copy of the}} content distributed to each user. The collusion attack is a powerful attack where several different <b>fingerprinted</b> copies of the same content are combined together to attenuate or even remove the <b>fingerprints.</b> One major category of collusion-resistant <b>fingerprinting</b> employs an explicit step of coding. Most existing works on coded <b>fingerprinting</b> mainly focus on the code-level issues and treat the embedding issues through abstract assumptions without examining the overall performance. In this paper, we jointly consider the coding and embedding issues for coded <b>fingerprinting</b> systems and examine their performance in terms of collusion resistance, detection computational complexity, and distribution efficiency. Our studies show that coded <b>fingerprinting</b> has efficient detection but rather low collusion resistance. Taking advantage of joint coding and embedding, we propose a permuted subsegment embedding technique and a group-based joint coding and embedding technique to improve the collusion resistance of coded <b>fingerprinting</b> while maintaining its efficient detection. Experimental {{results show that the}} number of colluders that the proposed methods can resist is more than three times as many as that of the conventional coded <b>fingerprinting</b> approaches.

This is despite {{the existence of a}} trade-off between the accuracy of location estimation and the density of a laborious and time consuming survey for collecting training <b>fingerprints.</b> A generally accepted concept of increasing the density of a training dataset, without an increase in the amount of physical labor and time needed for surveying an environ-ment for additional <b>fingerprints,</b> is to leverage a propagation model for the generation of virtual training <b>fingerprints.</b> This process, however, burdens the user with an overhead in terms of implementing a propagation model, defining locations of virtual training <b>fingerprints,</b> generating virtual <b>fingerprints,</b> and storing the generated <b>fingerprints</b> in a training database. To address this issue, we propose the Enriched Training Database (ETD), a web-service that enables storage and management of training <b>fingerprints,</b> with an additional “enriching ” func-tionality.

We further propose a novel method for defining locations of virtual training <b>fingerprints</b> based on modified Voronoi diagrams, which removes the burden of defining virtual training points manually and which automatically “covers ” the regions without sufficient density of training <b>fingerprints.</b> The evaluation in our testbed shows that the use of automated generation of virtual training <b>fingerprints</b> in the ETD results in more than 25 % increase in point accuracy and 15 % in room-level accuracy of <b>fingerprinting.</b> I...|$|R
