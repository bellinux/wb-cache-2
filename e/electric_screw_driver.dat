40|$|There are few {{reports in}} the {{literature}} of complete obstruction of the vertebral artery (VA) due to an <b>electric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>driver</b> bit penetration through the neural foramen into the spinal canal with Brown-Séquard syndrome (BSS). A 25 -year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with a penetrated neck injury by an <b>electric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>driver</b> bit after a struggle. The patient presented the clinical features of BSS. Computed tomography scan revealed that the <b>electric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>driver</b> bit penetrated through the right neural foramen at the level of C 3 - 4, and it caused an injury to the right half of the spinal cord. Emergent angiography revealed VA dissection, which was managed by immediate coil embolization at both proximal and distal ends of the injury site. After occlusion of the VA, the <b>electric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>driver</b> bit was extracted under general anes-thesia. Bleeding was minimal and controlled without difficulties. No postoperative complications, such as wound dehiscence, CSF leakage, or infection, were noted. Endovascular approaches for occlusion of vertebral artery lesions are safe and effective methods of treatment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Robot {{manipulation}} tasks like inserting {{screws and}} pegs {{into a hole}} or automatic screwing require precise tip pose estimation. We pro-pose a novel method to detect and estimate the tip of elongated objects. We demonstrate that our method can estimate tip pose to millimeter-level accuracy. We adopt a probabilistic, appearance-based object detec-tion framework to detect pegs and bits for <b>electric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>drivers.</b> <b>Screws</b> are difficult to detect with feature- or appearance-based methods due to their reflective characteristics. To overcome this we propose a novel adap-tation of RANSAC with a parallel-line model. Subsequently, we employ image moments to detect the tip and its pose. We show that the pro-posed method allows a robot to perform object insertion with only two pairs of orthogonal views, without visual servoing...|$|R

5000|$|The pistol is {{converted}} to the [...]22 LR configuration by first disassembling the pistol and removing the barrel from the slide. Hold the extractor in the fully extended position by inserting a needle into {{a hole in the}} extractor. When purchased new, the pistol came with a <b>screw</b> <b>driver</b> that incorporated a cleaning chain in the hollow handle. The <b>screw</b> <b>driver</b> is designed to be inserted into the barrel guide in the slide without scratching the slide. Using the <b>screw</b> <b>driver,</b> the <b>screw</b> is removed from the extractor faceplate and the faceplate removed from the slide, being careful not to dislodge the small spring {{on the end of the}} firing pin. The faceplate is then flipped over and replaced in the slide so that the firing pin is inserted into the upper hole of the faceplate for rimfire operation. The screw is then reinserted into the faceplace. When the faceplate screw is fully tightened, it is important to note that the screw head will protrude from the faceplace slightly and will not be flush with the faceplate as with the centerfire configuration. Insert the [...]22 LR barrel into the frame. Remove the needle to allow the extractor to return to its operational position. The slide is replaced in the frame and the [...]22 LR magazine is inserted to complete the conversion. In the [...]22 LR configuration, the extractor remains extended and always shows the red marking on top. This means that when the pistol is in the [...]22 LR configuration, the extractor always indicates [...] "chamber loaded", even when the chamber is empty.|$|R

40|$|Background The {{objective}} {{was to examine the}} changes in neuroforaminal height at L 4 -L 5 and L 5 -S 1 after insertion and graduated foraminal distraction using the 2 level transsacral implant in a cadaveric model. Methods Discectomy and transsacral instrumentation was performed in six fresh human cadavers at L 4 -S 1. The neuroforaminal height was measured at L 4 -L 5 and L 5 -S 1 before and after insertion of the implant and then at each stage of manual distraction. Results Mean L 4 - 5 neuroforaminal height increased from 18. 2 ± 3. 1 mm to 20. 3 ± 2. 9 mm (11 %) on the left and from 18. 8 ± 2. 8 mm to 20. 6 ± 2. 3 mm (12 %) on the right (P< 0. 05). Mean L 5 -S 1 neuroforaminal height increased from 15. 7 ± 3. 0 mm to 18. 4 ± 2. 8 mm (17 %) on the left and from 15. 6 ± 2. 1 mm to 18. 3 ± 1. 8 mm (17 %) on the right (P< 0. 05). When the neuroforaminal height was plotted against amount of rotation of the <b>screw</b> <b>driver</b> {{it was found that the}} neuroforaminal height at L 5 -S 1 increased by 1 mm on average for every complete revolution of the <b>screw</b> <b>driver.</b> At least 2 full rotations of the <b>screw</b> <b>driver</b> were achieved in all cadavers. Conclusions The transsacral screw construct distracted the disc space and neuroforaminal height in a cadaveric spine model without soft tissue envelope. During the initial process, manual control of disc space distraction predictably correlated with the increase in the neuroforaminal height to a maximum. However, further research is needed to look at variables affecting disc space pliability, implant subsidence, in vivo application, and clinical benefit of this procedure...|$|R

5000|$|North Bros. key {{acquisition}} was {{the hiring}} of Zachary Furbish when it purchased the Forest City Screwdriver Co in 1897. He brought with him patents related to a spiral ratchet <b>screw</b> <b>driver</b> and considerable experience in tool design. This was their foothold into the tool manufacturing industry which would later become the core of their business. Furbish alone would eventually amass 30 patents related to hand tools produced by North Bros., despite passing away in 1906, and his designs would become the backbone of their product lines for years to come. North Bros. tool brand was called Yankee, much like how Sears tools are branded Craftsman, and every tool they sold sported this trademark. In later years the [...] Yankee name would become synonymous with the spiral ratchet <b>screw</b> <b>driver</b> invented by Furbish but it was originally seen on everything from bench vises to cutting tools. Building upon the line of tools originally made by Forest City, North Bros. soon expanded their selection of offerings.
