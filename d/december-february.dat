5|$|Breeding {{coincides with}} the {{availability}} of water. In South America and South Africa, the main nesting period is <b>December–February,</b> in Nigeria it is July–December, and in North America mid-May–August. In India, the breeding season is from June to October but peaking in July and August. Fulvous whistling ducks show lifelong monogamy, although the courtship display is limited to some mutual head-dipping before mating and a short dance after copulation in which the birds raise their bodies side-by-side while treading water.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Argentina {{is a complex}} subject: the vast size {{of the country and}} {{considerable}} variation in altitude make {{for a wide range of}} climate types. Argentina has four seasons: winter (June–August), spring (September–November), summer (<b>December–February)</b> and autumn (March–May), all featuring different weather conditions. Summers are the warmest and wettest season in most of the country except in most of Patagonia where it is the driest season. Winters are normally mild in the north, cool in the center and cold in the southern parts with the latter experiencing frequent frost and snow. Because southern parts of the country are moderated by the surrounding oceans, the cold is less intense and prolonged than areas at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere. Spring and autumn are transition seasons that generally feature mild weather.|$|E

25|$|Taunggyi has a humid {{subtropical}} climate (Köppen climate classification Cwa), closely bordering a subtropical highland climate (Cwb).

25|$|The male fox's scrotum is held {{up close}} to the body with the testes inside even after they descend. Like other canines, the male fox has a baculum, or penile bone.

25|$|The plumage {{of first}} winter birds {{is the same}} as the adult basic plumage. However, the first pre-alternate moult occurs later in the year. The adult pre-alternate moult is <b>December–February,</b> (even {{starting}} as early as November in U. a. albionis). First year birds can be in basic plumage as late as May, and their alternate plumage can retain some white feathers around the throat.|$|E
25|$|The wildcat has two estrus periods, one in <b>December–February</b> {{and another}} in May–July. Estrus lasts 5–9 days, with a {{gestation}} period lasting 60–68 days. Ovulation is induced through copulation. Spermatogenesis occurs throughout the year. During the mating season, males fight viciously, and may congregate around a single female. There are records {{of male and female}} wildcats becoming temporarily monogamous. Kittens usually appear in April–May, though some may be born from March–August. Litter size ranges from 1–7 kittens.|$|E
25|$|The {{city has}} a {{tropical}} wet and dry climate (Köppen Aw) climate characterized by warm to hot temperatures year-round, with little seasonal variation due to its proximity to the equator, though nighttime temperatures dip somewhat {{during the winter months}} from January to March. Temperatures typically range from 19 to 34°C, rarely above 35 or below 17. The wet season lasts from June to November, and the dry season lasts from December to May of the following year. During <b>December–February,</b> it can get chilly during the night hours.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate is}} {{equatorial}} monsoonal, wet, {{and in general}} typical for the Maluku Islands. The rainy season extends from October to April with the highest rainfall in <b>December–February.</b> Despite the relatively small size of the island, its mountainous terrain results in several climatic zones. Apart from temperature reduction with altitude, the temperature variations across these zones are negligible, with the annual average of about 26°C, However the annual precipitation differs and amounts to 1,400–1,800mm in the north, 1,800–2,000mm in the center, 2,000–2,500mm {{in the south and}} 3,000–4,000mm in the mountains, at elevation above 500 m.|$|E

500|$|Red foxes {{reproduce}} {{once a year}} in spring. Two {{months prior}} to oestrus (typically December), the reproductive organs of vixens change shape and size. By the time they enter their oestrus period, their uterine horns double in size, and their ovaries grow 1.5–2 times larger. Sperm formation in males begins in August–September, with the testicles attaining their greatest weight in <b>December–February.</b> The vixen's oestrus period lasts three weeks, during which the dog-foxes mate with the vixens for several days, often in burrows. [...] The male's bulbus glandis enlarges during copulation, forming a copulatory tie which may last {{for more than an}} hour. The gestation period lasts 49–58 days. Though foxes are largely monogamous, DNA evidence from one population indicated large levels of polygyny, incest and mixed paternity litters. Subordinate vixens may become pregnant, but usually fail to whelp, or have their kits killed postpartum by either the dominant female or other subordinates.|$|E

Most of the winter precipitation is the result of synoptic scale, low pressure weather systems (large scale storms such as extratropical cyclones), particularly the sudestada, which often bring long periods of precipitation, cloudiness, cooler temperatures, and strong winds. Snowfall is extremely rare and mainly confined to the uplands of Misiones Province where the last significant snowfall occurred in 1975 in Bernardo de Irigoyen. Spring (September–November) is similar to fall with a mean precipitation of [...]|$|E
