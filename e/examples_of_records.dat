British production company Zeppotron produced the programme after being commissioned in 2002 by the Channel Four Television Corporation, who broadcast the show on their eponymous channel. The People's Book of Records was featured as part of a [...] season of new television programming on Channel 4 during 2003, and ran for a single series of nine 30-minute weekly episodes.

5000|$|The term [...] "cover" [...] {{goes back}} decades when cover version {{originally}} described a rival {{version of a}} tune recorded {{to compete with the}} recently released (original) version. The Chicago Tribune described the term in 1952: [...] "trade jargon meaning to record a tune that looks like a potential hit on someone else's label". <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> covered include Paul Williams' 1949 hit tune [...] "The Hucklebuck" [...] and Hank Williams' 1952 song [...] "Jambalaya". Both crossed over to the popular Hit Parade and had numerous hit versions. Before the mid-20th century, the notion of an original version of a popular tune would have seemed slightly odd - the production of musical entertainment was seen as a live event, even if it was reproduced at home via a copy of the sheet music, learned by heart or captured on a gramophone record. In fact, one of the principal objects of publishing sheet music was to have a composition performed by as many artists as possible.|$|E

An audit is a review of your books and records to verify correct hours have been reported in the correct risk classifications. Audits may also be performed to determine if your firm has workers covered by Washington workers ’ compensation laws (industrial insurance laws). Audits commonly include a visual inspection of a job site or work location. What records will we look at?

There is a changeover from paper-based records to electronic records in many organizations and these organizations often implement information systems managing electronic records that only take archival requirements into consideration to some extent, if at all. This {{is a problem}} that makes preservation of electronic records difficult. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe the characteristics of records, based on a study of empirical data and archival theory. It is essential to identify and understand the characteristics of a record in order to manage and preserve records in computerised systems. Knowledge of what characteristics a record has is one way to make it possible to formalize records. Formalization at different levels is needed for computerized management of records. This paper is based on a qualitative case study performed at four different organizations in Sweden. Empirical data was collected from multiple sources within each organization and resulted in five groups of characteristics with several sublevels. The empirical data were compared with recordkeeping and archival theory. Based on this study the essential characteristics of records were identified as context, form, organization, structure and version/copy. Framtidens arkivPI - Publika Informationssyste...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} ohline newsmedia databases {{which have}} been intentionally designed to respond to needs for information that is more current than the information in printed indexes or online versions of these indexes. It is suggest 9 d that these databases are useful to libraries because, in addition to subject indexing, they have "word access, " e. g., to names of people, products, companies, or geographical regions. By using word access, librarians can more efficiently track down such elusive elements as a quote from a speech that may never be indexed in a bibliographic database. Databases that provide up-to-date information include: (1) databases designed to provide current records for an older file; (2) full-text databases; (3) wire-service databases which make full-text information available immediately or shortly after being transmitted to newspapers; (4) databases that quickly index current sources; (5) summaries of news stories; and (6) press-release databases. Five such databases are used as exemplars: Newsearch, AP News, Washington PressText, Washington Post Electronic Edition, and USAToday Decisionline. The discussion of each database focuses on variations in the database structure, subject access, and search strategies, with emphasis on the DIALOG versions of these files. It is noted that other strategies are generally applicable. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> {{from each of the}} databases are included.

40|$|Wheeler {{emphasized}} {{the study of}} Superspace - the space of 3 -geometries on a spatial manifold of fixed topology. This is a configuration space for GR; knowledge of configuration spaces is useful as regards dynamics and QM. In this Article I consider furthmore generalized configuration spaces to all levels within the conventional `equipped sets' paradigm of mathematical structure used in fundamental Theoretical Physics. This covers A) the more familiar issue of topology change {{in the sense of}} topological manifolds (tied to cobordisms), including via pinched manifolds. B) The less familiar issue of not regarding as fixed the yet deeper levels of structure: topological spaces themselves (and their metric space subcase), collections of subsets and sets. Isham has previously presented quantization schemes for a number of these. I consider some classical preliminaries for this program, aside from the most obvious (classical dynamics for each). Rather, I provide I) to all levels Relational and Background Independence criteria, which have Problem of Time facets as consequences. I demonstrate that many of these issues descend all the way down, whilst also documenting at which level the others cease to apply. II) Probability theory on configuration spaces. In fact such a stochastic treatment is how to further mathematize the hitherto fairly formal and sketchy subject of records theory (a type of formultion of quantum gravity). Along these lines I provide a number of further <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> theories. This is in addition to Kendall's shape statistics being the example corresponding to relational mechanics models. To this example I now add 1) Cech cohomology, 2) Kendall's random sets, 3) the lattice of topologies on a fixed set. I finally consider 4) sheaves, both as a generalization of Cech cohomology and in connection to the study of stratified manifolds such as Superspace itself. Comment: 29 pages including 9 figures.

40|$|A {{large number}} of the dikes in the North Sea and Baltic Sea regions are covered with grass that is exposed to {{hydraulic}} loading from waves and currents during storm surges. During previous storm surges the grass cover layers often showed large strength and remained undamaged. A clear physical understanding {{of the failure of}} grass cover layers due to different wave loads is therefore indispensable today, especially against the background of enhanced hydraulic impact due to climate change. The strength of the grass cover layer lies mainly in its ability to withstand three types of wave actions:  Wave impact due to wave breaking on the seaward slope  Wave run-up and run-down flow after wave breaking on the seaward slope  Down-slope flow on the landward slope caused by wave overtopping. The main objectives of this research project are therefore to perform large scale model tests to investigate in detail the failure of grass cover layers due to (i) wave impact, (ii) wave runup and run-down flow and (iii) wave overtopping. Wave impact as well as wave run-up and run-down flow may induce grass cover failure on the seaward dike slope. Wave overtopping causes failure of the grass cover at the dike crest and on the shoreward slope. Hence, this research project deals with the investigation of grass cover failure anywhere along a dike profile: seaward slope, dike crest and shoreward slope. It is envisaged that the proposed research and tests will improve the understanding of the failure of grass cover layers due to wave loading. To obtain the aforementioned research objectives, large scale model tests at a dike model have been performed in the Large Wave Flume of the Coastal Research Centre – a joint centre of the University of Hanover and the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany. The dike model represents a typical sea dike. With exception of the seaward slope, it is comparable to typical cross sections of sea dikes built in The Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. This relatively steep seaward slope has been chosen to improve the generation of wave impact on the seaward slope. The crest height of the dike model is 5. 8 m above the bottom of the wave flume and the dike model consists of a sand core covered by a layer of clay and a grass layer. The 0. 2 m thick grass cover layer is constructed with grass sods that have been excavated at the existing Ribe sea defence in Denmark and transported to the Large Wave Channel in Hannover by trucks. The report presents a first reporting of the EroGRASS project including a description of the design and construction of the dike model in the Large Wave Flume, the measuring and observation techniques and the test programme together with <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> from the performed tests. Focus of this report is put on providing a well-documented description of the aforementioned issues, whereas the data analysis and presentation of the results are not included in this report since these are in progress and will be reported later...|$|E
