As the foam is a superior <b>insulant,</b> coupled with just 100mm of insulation at joist level, your roof will also meet the stringent thermal performance standards required for a new home.

40|$|Inclination of an enclosed, {{leaktight}} rectangular, 910 mm x 316 mm, 10 mm {{thick layer}} of perlite, led to the maximum rate of heat transfer through it occurring with the layer at an angle of 75 Â° to the horizontal. The apparent thermal conductivity of a horizontal layer of perlite, when heated from below, depends upon the velocity of any air draught blowing over the insulant's upper surface as well as upon the permeability of that upper surface. A horizontal air draught of 1 Â· 5 ms- 1, at 100 mm above {{the top of a}} 100 mm thick horizontal layer of perlite (e. g. as could occur in lofts), resulted in an increase exceeding 20 per cent in the rate of heat transmission for a 5 Â°C per centimetre temperature gradient through the <b>insulant.</b> Suppression of convection out of an otherwise open-topped 100 mm thick horizontal layer of perlite (above which no forced convection ensued) by means of the presence of building paper achieved a reduction of about 8 per cent in the rate of heat transfer through the <b>insulant.</b> The present investigation thus emphasises that such layers should be employed above <b>insulant</b> layers to inhibit convection losses, provided interstitial condensation will then not occur within the <b>insulant</b> layer. Leakage of air into the <b>insulant</b> layer from below (as occurs through ceilings beneath attic spaces) enhances buoyancy driven convection, resulting in increased rates of heat loss and hence higher apparent conductivities. Surprisingly, an increase in the thickness of the horizontal perlite layer with an open top, also leads to a significant rise in the mean apparent thermal conductivity of the <b>insulant.</b> Such conclusions cast doubts on the worthwhileness of many [`]economic thickness' predictions made assuming a commercially supplied value (obtained under no internal convection conditions) for the insulant's apparent conductivity, and its invariance with the thickness of the <b>insulant.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Factors {{influencing}} {{the ability of}} a conventional domestic hot-water tank to deliver domestic hot water rapidly have been culled, collated or assessed experimentally.

Among the design conclusions are: 1. (i) The optimal value of the ratio of height-to-diameter for the thermal store lies between 3 and 4. This is a compromise between achieving the improvements associated with (a) having a high degree of stratification (e. g. resulting from the use of a tall tank) and so facilitating rapid heat removal, and (b) minimising the surface area (and hence the rate of wild heat loss from the store). 2. (ii) Preferably, the walls of the thermal store should be made of a low-thermal-conductivity material and, provided mechanical integrity can be assured, only be of small thickness, thereby enhancing the degree of stratification achieved in the store. 3. (iii) An approximate value for the optimal thickness of thermal <b>insulant</b> applied to the tank, in order to minimise the wild heat losses through the tank's walls, can be calculated. Thus, for a typical <b>insulant,</b> it is recommended that a thickness of more than three times that traditionally used on domestic hot-water tanks be applied. 4.

40|$|Abstract. Polyurethane {{closed-cell}} rigid foams {{have been}} widely used as <b>insulants</b> in the building and refrigeration industry and also for district heating pipes. It is the special combination of excellent insulation performance and the mechanical stability due to the foaming process which makes this material very attractive for these applications. The replacement of chlorofluorocar-bons, which have been banned as blowing agents since 1993, by hydrocarbons in Europe caused a decrease in the insulation capability of polyurethane rigid foams. The additional global require-ment to reduce energy losses also adds an incentive to search for potential substances which would improve the thermal performance of rigid foams. To overcome this problem the heat transfer within polyurethane rigid foams via the polymer matrix, enclosed gas, and thermal radiation was examined in various independent experiments. Most importantly, it was observed that the potential to reduce the thermal conductivity of polyurethane rigid foams is higher than had been predicted. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} certain workmanship requirements {{applying to}} insulants in cavities. It presents previously reported measured {{values for the}} effects of edge gaps, and compares these results with new laboratory measured results for the heat transfer across insulated wall and ceiling cavities, in configurations which permit natural convection to flow around the <b>insulant.</b> The results show the ex-istence of a threshold edge gap width of a few mm for the onset of convection in upward heat flow, but no threshold gap width of detectable size for horizontal heat flow. The loss of thermal performance from convection, as expected, outweighs that previously reported for non-convecting gaps. SUMMARY THERE IS NOW a considerable amount of data [1 - 8] concerning the lossof thermal performance of structural cavities which can result from ther-mal bridging of various forms and degree. In many of these reports, losses of 3 to 5 % of the cavity insulating value for each 1 % of gap width (i. e., edge gap as a percent of cavity width), seem to be quite typical, although there are a few reports in which the loss reaches 10 % or more per 1 % of gap width. To give a perspective to these figures, note that a gap of 1 % would mean a gap width of 5 mm when the frame spacing is at 500 mm, and so would not be difficult either to detect or to avoid. At least one case has been reported [7] in which degradation was much more severe even than above. This is recognisably a case where convective air circulation has enabled heat to bypass the <b>insulant.</b> It occurred in a wall panel, where the convective circulation pressure difference may be relatively large.

40|$|Esters of {{palm kernel}} oil have been {{synthesized}} and characterized for application as electrical insulating oil. Since such fluids serve both as <b>insulants</b> and coolants, tests were performed to characterize the chemical, physical and dielectric properties. Accelerated ageing tests were carried out to mimic conditions in a power transformer. Alkyl esters were synthesized from laboratory purified {{palm kernel oil}}: methyl ester was prepared through a transesterification reaction; an epoxidation reaction involving the methyl ester produced with insitu per-acetic acid {{in the presence of}} a catalyst to produce corresponding epoxy alkyl ester. This was then reacted with acid anhydrides under nitrogen in the presence of catalyst. This opened the epoxy rings of the epoxy alkyl oleate and linoleate components to attach side hydrocarbon chains. The characteristics and composition of the products were monitored using GC-MS and FTIR spectroscopy. The synthesized ester possessed a flash point that satisfied the specified minimum flash point for mineral oil, higher thermo-oxidative stability, and high and reliable breakdown strength from the distribution of breakdown data (43 kV/mm). It has a melting point of about - 7 ˚C which is higher than mineral oil. An ester-paper sample which was aged in a pressure vessel under nitrogen and metal catalysts exhibited improved performance compared with the mineral oil-paper system. The rate of decrease in the tensile strength of alkyl ester-paper within the ageing condition was significantly lower than mineral oil-paper. Impregnation of cellulose paper with ester increased the charge storage capacity of the insulating paper. A strong low frequency dielectric dispersion (LFD) was observed which became more pronounced with ageing. Quasi-DC conduction was deduced to have dominated the low frequency response of alkyl ester-paper. The characteristic breakdown strength of the aged paper samples in comparison with the unaged sample did not show any significant difference. It is suggested that the synthesized ester is as good as mineral oil in many ways and a viable alternative fluid for cooling and insulating power transformers.
