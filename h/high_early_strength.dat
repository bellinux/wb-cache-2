This study focuses on the use of fly ash in the range of 0 - 30 %, silica fume 0 - 10 % and calcium carbonate 0 - 15 % of the cement content, by mass. The workability of the fresh mortar was evaluated and the compressive strength of hardened mortar were measured at the ages of 7, 14, 28 and 56 days. Test results show that increasing partial replacement of cement with fly ash increased the workability and compressive strength of mortar. The use of silica fume reduces the workability of the fresh mortar, and thus requires the addition of superplasticizer to improve the workability.

These measurements indicated that pier settlement in only one pier, namely [...] "pier 27" [...] in the Kovvur Channel was of the order of 211 mm, which needed corrective action, while in all other piers the settlement was less than 75 mm indicating that pier foundations had settled down. Since the rotation in the vertical plane exceeded the prescribed value for differential settlement, BBR, consultants to Hindustan Construction Company (HCC), anticipated that the top plate of the bearing is [...] "likely touch the bottom plate thereby damaging the bearing." [...] To remedy the situation, the consultant advised HCC, to maintain a uniform gradient of 200 mm between the piers 26, 27 and 28. However, the lifting of bearings by 200 mm was executed during the month of May 2003, even though the settlement of the pier in question was not significant after May 2002.

40|$|Abstract Using {{industry}} {{standards to}} commodify cement beginning in 1904, the cement and concrete industry surrendered {{control of their}} product to {{the market and the}} concrete industry as a whole developed a technocratic and conservative culture. Both industry standards and the culture which they have created have had lasting impacts on the industry with respect to innovation and potentially more sustainable concrete construction. Industry standards and project specifications have institutionalized concrete optimized for <b>high</b> <b>early</b> <b>strength</b> and rapid construction rather than durability. The objective of this research is to identify specific points at which industry standards can limit innovation and more sustainable concrete construction and then demonstrate the benefits of concrete optimized for durability. This thesis was tested using social networking tools to inform case study analysis. Networking results generated a ranking of the most central U. S. industry standards related to concrete bridge construction, providing a framework for case study analysis. The highest ranked standards, American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) C 150 “Standard Specification for Portland Cement” and American Concrete Institute (ACI) 211. 1 “Standard Practice for Proportioning Normal, Heavyweight, and Mass Concrete,” were then evaluated using sustainability metrics. These documents do not explicitly limit innovation or more sustainable construction, but it is the way these documents are used that impacts sustainable concrete construction. C 150 itself does not inhibit more sustainable material, but {{the way in which it}} is used by architects and engineers to garner <b>high</b> <b>early</b> <b>strength</b> renders concrete with heavier environmental impacts than necessary. Even though ACI 211. 1 is not a legally binding document, it has established the status quo for proportioning concrete for <b>high</b> <b>early</b> <b>strength.</b> The industry has evolved under pressure to optimize for <b>high</b> <b>early</b> <b>strength</b> at the cost of durability. Industry standardization has developed a conservative culture, but it is actually the individual project specifications rather than industry standards that explicitly inhibit sustainable concrete construction. This study also demonstrates the benefits of optimizing for durability. Designing a durable concrete using well-graded aggregates and performance-based specifications significantly reduced cement paste requirements in nearly all cases, which showed reduced material impact of fresh mixes. Durability projections augmented the sustainability benefits dramatically.

However, slag hydrates slower which delay strength gain in UHPC which can be addressed by using slag of high fineness. In this study, cement is replaced by slag at 20 % and 60 % by weight. Slag of three different fineness is used: 400 ± 4 m 2 /kg, 556 ± 5 m 2 /kg and 750 ± 5 m 2 /kg at constant water-binder ratio of 0. 25 for all mixes. Compressive and flexural strength were measured for mechanical performance while water penetration test and chloride migration test were conducted to enumerate durability. Results show that early and late compressive strength and flexural strength are improved significantly by incorporation of slag with fineness 556 ± 5 m 2 /kg compared to reference and slag of 400 m 2 /kg fineness.

Many publications have reported the excellent performance {{of concrete}} containing mineral admixtures (MAs), such as ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) and pulverized fuel ash (PFA), in coastal marine environments. However, the rate of hydration or pozzolanic activity of MAs in the concrete is slow. As a result, the resistance offered to the penetration of chloride ions also increases slowly with time. This paper reports the results of an experimental study conducted to evaluate the effect of curing conditions on the strength, porosity, and chloride ingress characteristics of concretes made with high slag blast furnace cement (HBFC) and ordinary Portland cement (OPC). A total of six different concrete mixtures were cast and tested. The experimental variables included water-to-binder ratio (W/B) ratios, curing environments, and curing durations. W/B ratios used were 0. 33, 0. 34, and 0. 36. Two types of curing conditions are investigated: seawater immersion and marine atmospheric exposure during curing at 4, 7, 28, 90, 180, and 360 day intervals. The results indicated that the curing condition had pronounced effects on the related properties. Seawater-cured specimens showed a slightly <b>higher</b> <b>early</b> <b>strength</b> but a lower ultimate strength as compared with air-cured specimens. The HBFC concretes had lower MIP porosity than the corresponding OPC concretes with the same design strength.

Most of researcher discusses the topics on design the concrete material model to sustain againts the explosive detonation. The implementation of modern reinforcement steels and fibres in ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete matrix can reduce the extreme loading effects. However, most researchers have proved that geopolymer concrete (GPC) has better mechanical properties towards high performance concrete, compared to OPC. GPC has the <b>high</b> <b>early</b> compressive <b>strength</b> and <b>high</b> ability to resist the thermal energy from explosive detonation. In addition, OPC production is less environmental friendly than geopolymer cement. Geopolymer used can lead to environmental protection besides being improved in mechanical properties. Thus, this paper highlighted on an experimental, numerical and the analytical studies cause of the explosive detonation impact to concrete structures...|$|R
40|$|The use of GGBS as {{supplement}} for cements {{has been}} shown to improve the long-term strength and durability properties of concrete. In practice, while the chemical composition of GGBS from a single plant may be constant, due to the varying sources from which GGBS is obtained the chemical composition from plant to plant may vary. The wide variability in the use of GGBS as a SCM in different climates, coupled with differences in chemical composition, is bound to have impact on the performance of slag blends. This study investigated the combined influence of difference in slag composition and temperature on the performance of slag blends. Performance was evaluated in terms of strength and transport properties. Paste samples were characterised by calorimetry, TGA, XRD and SEM to follow hydration and microstructural development. Mortar samples were used to follow strength development and transport properties. All tests were carried out at temperatures of 20 and 38 °C. Curing at 38 °C accelerated the early hydration, but not the later hydration. This led to <b>higher</b> <b>early</b> <b>strengths</b> and lower later strengths, and was attributed to the coarsening of the pore structure caused by the high temperature curing. Except at the early ages at 20 °C, both slag blends showed better strength performance than the reference cement. The slag blends also showed better transport properties than the reference cement, especially at 38 °C, and this was attributed to their finer pore structure and higher chloride binding capacity. Of the two slags studied, the more reactive slag (slag 1) had better performance, especially at 38 °C. Performance of the slag blends at 20 °C was influenced mainly by the length of curing, and by the difference in chemical composition at 38 °C. ...|$|R
