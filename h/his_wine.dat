5|$|Joseph W. Osborne {{may have}} made the first wine from Zinfandel in California. He planted Zinfandel from Macondray at his Oak Knoll {{vineyard}} just north of Napa, and <b>his</b> <b>wine</b> was much praised in 1857. Planting of Zinfandel boomed soon after, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century it was the most widespread variety in California.|$|E
5|$|The hero's inseparable {{companion}} was his powerful, talking {{piebald horse}} Šarac; Marko always {{gave him an}} equal share of <b>his</b> <b>wine.</b> The horse could leap three spear-lengths high and four spear-lengths forward, enabling Marko to capture the dangerous, elusive vila Ravijojla. She became his blood sister, promising to help him in dire straits. When Ravijojla helped him kill the monstrous, three-hearted Musa Kesedžija (who almost defeated him), Marko grieved because he had slain a better man than himself.|$|E
50|$|Despite Thackrey's fringe profile, he has {{consistently}} received high scores from major critics such as Robert Parker. Although Thackrey has never advertised <b>his</b> <b>wines,</b> customer demand for <b>his</b> <b>wines</b> considerably outweighs <b>his</b> small-scale production.|$|R

5|$|Fender {{worked for}} his father, {{including}} periods spent in France and Belgium, {{up until the}} outbreak of war in 1914, but {{when he returned from}} active service found the business frustrating. With his father's approval, he left the firm to start his own wine business with his brother Robert. The business thrived, in part owing to Fender's wide range of connections, and he remained chairman and managing director until 1976. For a time, Fender produced his own whiskey brand, which he tried to sell when touring South Africa with the MCC in 1922–23, but competition from the larger distilling companies meant that it was a short-lived success. After the Second World War, he had to rebuild <b>his</b> <b>wine</b> firm, which had suffered from wartime restrictions and hardships, this time assisted by his son. He and Robert also established a paper merchants called Fender Brothers, although he later relinquished his shares in the company. Meanwhile, he maintained his connections with Crescens Robinson and followed his father as chairman of the company from 1943 to 1968.|$|E
5|$|While {{most of the}} {{employees}} are congregated in the pool area, Robert gives some of the male employees a tour of his massive home, spending {{most of the time}} mournfully describing how it was intended to be the location for wild, uninhibited parties. He offers those present on the tour a free bottle of wine from <b>his</b> <b>wine</b> cellar and the staff proceed to get drunk. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) had intended to make a token appearance at Robert's party and quickly return home to his wife and kids; however, Robert, sensing his reluctance to be there, insists that Jim stay {{for the duration of the}} tour in order to punish him for laughing at an inopportune moment earlier that day as Robert had complained about having to sell his house. Eventually, Robert realizes that he is hosting one of the parties he had always imagined, at which point he jumps into the pool completely naked, followed by Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who had both been battling all night to impress him. Jim takes this as his cue to leave, sneaking away and driving home at top speed. At the end of the night, Gabe and Ryan, both drunk and unwilling to concede defeat in their brown-nosing battle, remain at the party with Robert even as the CEO passes out.|$|E

25|$|Hauz Rani and Budayuni Gates, {{which were}} {{reportedly}} once prominent gates, are now traced in ruins. An interesting anecdote of {{history of the}} Budayuni gate, considered then as the principal gate of the city by Ibn Battuta (the chronicler of the period, mentions it as the main gate to the city), is that Allauddin Khalji had resolved to shun drinking of alcohol by emptying <b>his</b> <b>wine</b> caskets and breaking his rich Chinaware at this gate. The gate was also known for punishment meted out to the guilty. They were tortured and beheaded in public view at this gate. A strict watch was maintained at this gate to detect and prevent incursions by Mongolians.|$|E
25|$|In 1740, {{four years}} after Garrick's arrival in London and with <b>his</b> <b>wine</b> {{business}} failing, he saw his first play, a satire, Lethe: or Aesop in the Shade, produced at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Within a year he was appearing professionally playing small parts at the Goodman's Fields Theatre under the management of Henry Giffard. The Goodman's Fields Theatre had been shuttered by the Licensing Act of 1737 which closed all theatres that did not hold the letters patent and required all plays {{to be approved by}} the Lord Chamberlain before performance. Garrick's performances at the theatre were a result of Giffard's help with Garrick's wine business. Giffard had helped Garrick win the business of the Bedford Coffee-house, an establishment patronised by many theatrical and literary people and a location Garrick frequented.|$|E

5000|$|Draper is an {{advocate}} of natural winemaking, though Ridge is not a certified organic winery. His view stems from his desire to let the vineyards [...] "express themselves" [...] and their terroir without over intrusiveness by man. He has been a critic of overly-powerful, over oak and highly alcoholic wines made from excessively ripe fruit, preferring <b>his</b> <b>wines</b> to be more about finesse and balance. He {{has also been a}} critic of high wine prices and consumers who purchase wine for speculating purposes rather than to enjoy them. He has been a harsh critic of the UC Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology in their emphasis of more [...] "industrial winemaking" [...] versus the traditional methods that he prefers. In contrast to other California Cabernets, Draper's wines are normally around 13% ABV which is low even in comparison to Bordeaux <b>wines.</b> Though <b>his</b> <b>wines</b> are often more of a French style, he has preferred to use American oak because they seem to perform better with <b>his</b> <b>wines.</b>|$|R

25|$|Ricasoli choose Sangiovese to be {{the base}} of Chianti because it {{provided}} the most aromatics. Canaiolo brought fruitiness to the wine that soften the tannins of Sangiovese without lessening the aromatics. The addition of the white wine grape Malvasia was to provide further softening. Wine expert Hugh Johnson noted that the relationship that Ricasoli describes between Sangiovese and Canaiolo has some parallels to how Cabernet Sauvignon is softened by the fruit of Merlot in the traditional Bordeaux style blend. Ricasoli continued with his winemaking endeavors until 1848 when his wife died. Stricken by grief, he had little desire for his vineyards or <b>his</b> <b>wine.</b> During this time the tides of the Risorgimento were growing stronger and Ricasoli {{found himself in the}} political arena which would eventually lead to him becoming the Prime Minister of Italy.|$|E
25|$|Crosby had an {{interest}} in sports. In the 1930s, his friend and former college classmate, Gonzaga head coach Mike Pecarovich appointed Crosby as an assistant football coach. From 1946 until the end of his life, he was part-owner of baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates. Although he was passionate about his team, he was too nervous to watch the deciding Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, choosing to go to Paris with Kathryn and listen to the game on the radio. Crosby had the NBC telecast of the game recorded on kinescope. The game {{was one of the most}} famous in baseball history, capped off by Bill Mazeroski's walk-off home run. He apparently viewed the complete film just once, and then stored it in <b>his</b> <b>wine</b> cellar, where it remained undisturbed until it was discovered in December 2009. The restored broadcast was shown on MLB Network in December 2010.|$|E
25|$|The story {{takes place}} in an {{alternate}} world dominated by a powerful church called the Magisterium, and where part of the soul resides outside a person as an animal companion called a dæmon. Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) is an orphan raised at Jordan College in Oxford, while her uncle, esteemed explorer and scholar Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), is busy seeking the elusive Dust, a cosmic particle of which the Magisterium has forbidden even the mention. When Asriel returns from his latest expedition, Lyra and her dæmon Pantalaimon (Freddie Highmore) witness a Magisterium agent poison <b>his</b> <b>wine.</b> Lyra warns her uncle, saving his life; then she watches Asriel give a presentation regarding his findings on the North Pole, where {{he was able to}} prove the Dust's existence. The college gives Asriel a grant to fund another expedition that could lead to the discovery of the infinite worlds linked by Dust, which would severely undermine the Magisterium's hold on the world.|$|E

500|$|Lowell {{was also}} {{involved}} in other reform movements. He urged better conditions for factory workings, opposed capital punishment, and supported the temperance movement. His friend Longfellow was especially concerned about his fanaticism for temperance, worrying that Lowell would ask him to destroy <b>his</b> <b>wine</b> cellar. There are many references to Lowell's drinking during his college years, and part of his reputation in school was based on it. His friend Edward Everett Hale denied these allegations. Lowell considered joining the [...] "Anti-Wine" [...] club at Harvard, and he became a teetotaler {{during the early years}} of his first marriage. However, as he gained notoriety, he became popular in social circles and clubs and he drank rather heavily when away from his wife. When he drank, he had wild mood swings, ranging from euphoria to frenzy.|$|E

Although he got somewhat better, giving his annual dinner to the King's Counsel, it was noticed that {{he was unable to}} drink <b>his</b> <b>wine</b> properly. He went to the Midland Circuit in June, as it was the easiest one, but he suffered from [...] "a violent cough" [...] and other symptoms, returning to his home in Hendon. After the first day of a two-day case he found himself losing his appetite and suffering from a fever, which caused him to talk incoherently and become delirious. The disease baffled doctors, and finally killed him on 4 November 1832 at his home in Queen Square, London; his last words were [...] "and now, gentlemen of the jury, you will consider of your verdict". He was interred at the Foundling Hospital, of which he was a governor.|$|E

But rather than flying {{to a place of}} safety among the Spanish inhabitants of the island the gansas fly higher and higher. On the first day of his flight Gonsales encounters [...] "illusions of 'Devils and Wicked Spirits in the shape of men and women, some of whom he is able to converse with. They provide him with food and drink for his journey and promise to set him down safely in Spain if only he will join their [...] "Fraternity", and [...] "enter into such Covenants as they had made to their Captain and Master, whom they would not name". Gonsales declines their offer, and after a journey of 12 days reaches the Moon. Suddenly feeling very hungry he opens the provisions he was given en route, only to find nothing but dry leaves, goat's hair and animal dung, and that <b>his</b> <b>wine</b> [...] "stunk like Horse-piss". He is soon discovered by the inhabitants of the Moon, the Lunars, whom he finds to be tall Christian people enjoying a happy and carefree life in a kind of pastoral paradise. Gonsales discovers that order is maintained in this apparently utopian state by swapping delinquent children with terrestrial children.|$|E
