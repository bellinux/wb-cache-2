5|$|In 1995, Sampson {{noted that}} earlier studies {{had found that}} the horns and frills of ceratopsians most likely had a {{function}} in intraspecific display and combat, and that these features would therefore have resulted from sexual selection for successful mating. Likewise, in 1997 Horner concluded that such ornamentation was used by males to establish dominance and that females would have preferred well-equipped males as their offspring would then inherit these traits, conferring a reproduction benefit. Dodson thought that in the Centrosaurinae in general the display value of the frill had been reduced compared to the nasal and supraorbital ornamentation. Sampson in 1995 rejected {{the possibility that the}} difference in skull ornamentation between Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus represented sexual dimorphism, <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>reasons.</b> Firstly, the extensive Einiosaurus bone beds did not contain any specimens with bosses, as would have been expected if one of the sexes had them. Secondly, Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus are found in strata of a different age. Thirdly, in a situation of sexual dimorphism usually only one of the sexes shows exaggerated secondary sexual characters. Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus however, each have developed a disctinct set of such traits.|$|E

Second, she was the first modern Iranian woman to graphically articulate private sexual landscapes from a woman's perspective. Finally, she transcended her own literary role and experimented with acting, painting, and documentary film-making.|$|E

Second, Thales would probably have found it easier to convince the Ionian city-states to join in a federation in order to push the Median threat away if he possessed such a tool. Finally, the philosophical idea of a global representation of the world simply for the sake of knowledge was reason enough to design one.|$|E
25|$|After the Civil War, General Robert E. Lee {{turned down}} several financially tantalizing offers of {{employment}} that would merely have traded on his name, and instead accepted the post of college president <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>reasons.</b> First, he had been superintendent of the United States Military Academy on the Hudson River at West Point, New York, so supervising higher education was in his background. Second, and more important, he {{believed that it was}} a position in which he could actually make a contribution to the reconciliation of the nation. Third, the Washington family were his in-laws: his wife was the great-granddaughter of Martha Washington, and Lee had long looked on George Washington as a hero and role model, so {{it is hardly surprising that}} he welcomed the challenge of leading a college endowed by and named after the first president.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1591 the plan for the purchasers of his land to {{discharge}} his debt to the Court of Wards was disrupted by the Queen's taking extents, or writs allowing a creditor to temporarily seize a debtor's property. De Vere complained that his servant Thomas Hampton had taken advantage of these writs by taking money from the tenants to his own use, and had also conspired with another of De Vere's servants to pass a fraudulent document under the Great Seal of England. The Lord Mayor, Thomas Skinner, was also involved. In June De Vere wrote to Burghley reminding him that he made an agreement with Elizabeth to relinquish his claim to the Forest of Essex <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>reasons,</b> {{one of which was}} the Queen's reluctance to punish Skinner's felony, which had caused De Vere to forfeit £20,000 in bonds and statutes.|$|E
25|$|According to musicologist Gerald Abraham, the operas on {{the whole}} embody an {{enormous}} mass of music far too beautiful and interesting to be ignored. Moreover, he maintains, Tchaikovsky's search for operatic subjects, along with his views on their nature and treatment and his own work on librettos, throw considerable light on his creative personality. Nevertheless, according to musicologist Francis Maes, most of Tchaikovsky's operas failed <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>reasons.</b> First, the composer could not get good librettos, despite continued requests to some of Russia's leading playwrights and his brother Modest. Second, he was no Verdi, Puccini or Leoncavalo. While he could write music that was often beautiful and sometimes very moving, it was generally not as arresting dramatically as anything those three provided. Third, and perhaps most sadly, Tchaikovsky's enthusiasm for opera writing did not match his theatrical sense. Apparently either unaware of this deficiency or unable to curb his excitement long enough to take a cold, {{hard look at the}} true stage-worthiness of a libretto, he seemed destined to repeat his failures.|$|E
25|$|Acceleration {{increased}} during S-IC flight <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>reasons.</b> One, increased acceleration {{increased the}} propellant pressure at the engines, increasing the flow rate somewhat. This {{was the least}} important factor, though this feedback effect often led to an undesirable thrust oscillation called pogo. Two, as it climbed into thinner air F-1 engine efficiency increased significantly, a property of all rockets. The combined thrust of five engines on the pad was about 7.5 million pounds, reaching nearly 9 million pounds at altitude. But the biggest contribution by far was the rocket's rapidly decreasing mass. The propellant in just the S-IC made up about three-quarters of Saturn V's entire launch mass, and it was furiously consumed at over 13 metric tonnes per second. Newton's second law states that force is equal to mass times acceleration, or equivalently that acceleration is equal to force divided by mass, so as the mass decreased (and the force increased somewhat), acceleration rose. Including gravity, launch acceleration was only 1¼g, i.e., the astronauts felt 1¼g while the rocket accelerated vertically at ¼g. As the rocket rapidly lost mass, total acceleration including gravity increased to nearly 4g at T+135 seconds. At this point, the inboard (center) engine was shut down to prevent acceleration from increasing beyond 4g.|$|E

500|$|Antarctica is {{colder than}} the Arctic <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>reasons.</b> First, {{much of the}} {{continent}} is more than [...] above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation in the troposphere. Second, the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the Earth is at aphelion in July (i.e., the Earth is farthest from the Sun in the Antarctic winter), and the Earth is at perihelion in January (i.e., the Earth is closest to the Sun in the Antarctic summer). The orbital distance contributes to a colder Antarctic winter (and a warmer Antarctic summer) but the first two effects have more impact.|$|E
500|$|Cochrane goes on, {{in chapter}} six, to {{consider}} Marxism. Unlike the other political theories explored in An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, Marxism is purportedly not a normative account but a scientific theory which predicts and explains {{the end of}} the state and the beginning of communism. This is understood as the inevitable conclusion of the history of the changing forms of economic relationships. Cochrane outlines the discontinuities between humans and animals that exist for Karl Marx and considers the extent to which animal-rights thinking is an example of bourgeois morality. These analyses serve to illustrate how Marxist thinking can be used to exclude animals, but counterarguments are offered. Cochrane then draws upon the work of Catherine Perlow and Barbara Noske, who have argued that animals may represent an exploited group in a Marxist sense, but he is critical of the argument that this exploitation is caused by capitalism and that overthrowing capitalism would be a necessary step for achieving justice. He next considers the work of David Sztybel and Ted Benton, who have drawn upon the adage of [...] "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need" [...] in relation to animals; Cochrane is wary about the use of the phrase <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>reasons.</b> First, it is unclear how central the idea is to Marxist thought; second, it is a principle only for societies in advanced stages of communism; and third, even if we assume we can know the needs of animals, the principle would entail the extension of justice beyond sentient animals, which is an idea that Cochrane rejects. Finally, Cochrane considers Benton's proposal that liberal rights-based approaches to animal justice cannot achieve their goal, and that Marxism can be used as a resource for political achievement. This is, for Cochrane, Marxism's most important contribution in the area.|$|E
