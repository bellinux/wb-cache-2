5|$|The breed has {{no known}} genetic health issues. Blue Picardy Spaniels can {{be prone to}} <b>ear</b> <b>infections,</b> which are common among dogs with {{pendulous}} ears, including Basset Hounds and other breeds of Spaniel. It has an average life expectancy of thirteen years.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} types of canine <b>ear</b> <b>infections</b> {{are caused by}} microorganisms, {{including}} yeast and bacterial infections. The most common variety of this is Malassezia pachydermatitis. Symptoms can include the dog shaking its head or scratching at its ears more frequently. The ear canal will appear inflamed, a pus-like substance will be discharged in some cases, and the ear will smell quite pungent in most cases. Treatment for the more common causes of otitis externa in dogs often includes oral antibiotics and flushing the ears with an antibacterial solution. In some cases, anti-inflammatory medication is prescribed. Some conditions can increase the chance of <b>ear</b> <b>infections,</b> including living in a humid environment and frequent swimming or bathing without adequate drying of the ear afterwards. Keeping {{the hair on the}} ears short {{can be used as a}} preventative method to ear problems.|$|E
5|$|Tinnitus is not {{a disease}} but a symptom that can result {{from a number of}} {{underlying}} causes. One of the most common causes is noise-induced hearing loss. Other causes include: <b>ear</b> <b>infections,</b> disease of the heart or blood vessels, Ménière's disease, brain tumors, emotional stress, exposure to certain medications, a previous head injury, and earwax. It is more common in those with depression.|$|E

5|$|Another common {{condition}} is otitis externa (outer <b>ear</b> <b>infections),</b> which {{is common to}} a variety of spaniels, as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making them more prone to recurrent infections than dogs with more upright ears. The infections can be caused by a variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi and generally dirt and germs. Treatment is relatively simple and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} long-eared spaniels, Russian Spaniels require checks to prevent <b>ear</b> <b>infections.</b> The breed {{does have an}} {{inclination}} to gain weight easily, which can be prevented by controlling food intake. The Russian Spaniel can be prone to food allergies, which are usually identified at between 1 and 5 months of age with the most common allergens being chicken and carrots. There are no other breed-specific health issues currently known.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is an {{antibiotic}} {{useful for the}} treatment of a number of bacterial infections. This includes middle <b>ear</b> <b>infections,</b> bone or joint infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, strep throat, pneumonia, and endocarditis among others. It can be useful against some cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It may also be used for acne and in addition to quinine for malaria. It is available by mouth, intravenously, and as a cream to be applied to the skin or in the vagina.|$|E

5|$|The Welsh Springer is {{generally}} a healthy breed, but some can suffer conditions common to many breeds such as hip dysplasia, Canine glaucoma and like other dogs with pendulous ears, they {{are prone to}} <b>ear</b> <b>infections</b> such as otitis externa. In a survey of over a hundred breeds of dog conducted in 1997, the Welsh Springer Spaniel was ranked 14th for worst hip score, with the average score of the breed being 18.45. The average lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E
5|$|At {{each stage}} {{mentioned}} above, children play with sounds and learn methods {{to help them}} learn words. There is a relationship between children's prelinguistic phonetic skills and their lexical progress at age two: failure to develop the required phonetic skills in their prelinguistic period results in children's delay in producing words. Environmental influences may affect children's phonological development, such as hearing loss {{as a result of}} <b>ear</b> <b>infections.</b> Deaf infants and children with hearing problems due to infections are usually delayed in the beginning of vocal babbling.|$|E
5|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the Kennel Club (UK), the American Cocker Spaniels had a median age of death of ten years and four months, while the English Cocker Spaniel had a median age of eleven years and two months. According to the survey, {{the most common cause of}} death for both breeds was cancer, while old age was the second most common cause. The two modern breeds are susceptible to several health problems. Issues common to the two breeds include <b>ear</b> <b>infections,</b> and a variety of eye problems. A large number of breeds are susceptible to hip dysplasia. In {{a survey conducted}} by Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the American Cocker Spaniel was ranked 115th out of 157 different breeds, with 1 being the highest percentage dysplastic and 157 being the lowest percentage dysplastic. The English Cocker was ranked 129th.|$|E

5|$|The Picardy Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog {{developed}} in France {{for use as}} a gundog. It is related to the Blue Picardy Spaniel, and still has many similarities, but the Picardy Spaniel is the older of the two breeds. It is thought {{to be one of the}} two oldest continental spaniel breeds and was favoured by the French nobility, remaining popular for hunting after the French Revolution due to its weather resistant coat that enabled it to hunt in a variety of conditions and terrain. However its popularity waned following the influx of English hunting breeds in the early 20th century. Slightly smaller than an English Setter but larger than most of its spaniel cousins, it has no major health issues although as with many breeds with pendulous ears, it can be prone to <b>ear</b> <b>infections.</b>|$|E
5|$|The meat, oil, bones, {{and skin}} of {{manatees}} are valuable items. In some countries, such as Nigeria and Cameroon, African manatees are sold to zoos, aquariums, and online as pets, sometimes being shipped internationally. Though illegal, lack {{of law enforcement}} in these areas induce poaching. Some residents of West African countries, such as Mali and Chad, depend on the oil of the African manatee to cure ailments such as <b>ear</b> <b>infections,</b> rheumatism, and skin conditions. Hunting is the largest source of mortality in Amazonian manatees, {{and there are no}} management plans except for in Colombia. Amazonian manatees, especially calves, are sometimes illegally sold as pets, but there are several institutions that care for and rescue these orphans, with the possibility of their releasing into the wild. The body parts of Dugongs are used as medicinal remedies across the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The ear drum {{may become}} {{perforated}} {{in the event}} of a large sound or explosion, when diving or flying (called barotrauma), or by objects inserted into the ear. Another common cause of injury is due to an infection such as otitis media. These may cause a discharge from the ear called otorrhea, and are often investigated by otoscopy and audiometry. Treatment may include watchful waiting, antibiotics and possibly surgery, if the injury is prolonged or the position of the ossicles is affected. Skull fractures that go through the part of the skull containing the ear structures (the temporal bone) can also cause damage to the middle ear. A cholesteatoma is a cyst of squamous skin cells that may develop from birth or secondary to other causes such as chronic <b>ear</b> <b>infections.</b> It may impair hearing or cause dizziness or vertigo, and is usually investigated by otoscopy and may require a CT scan. The treatment for cholesteatoma is surgery.|$|E

30|$|Otitis {{media is}} the {{inflammation}} {{of the middle ear}} cleft and the tympanum with otorrhoea lasting from 2  weeks to more than 3  months, with permanent perforation mainly caused by bacteria (Adoga et al. 2010; Mesfin and Muluken 2014). <b>Ear</b> <b>infection</b> may be acute or chronic purulent type (Wasihun and Zemene 2015). About 65 – 330 million people suffer from <b>ear</b> <b>infection</b> worldwide and 60  % of them had significant hearing loss (Woodfield and Dugdale 2008). Otitis media (OM) is a major health problem and occurs with a high incidence and prevalence in both developed and developing countries (Afolabi et al. 2012). The health and economic burden of <b>ear</b> <b>infection</b> is also severe especially in Africa and other developing countries where the disease prevalence is estimated as high as 11  % (WHO 2004).
