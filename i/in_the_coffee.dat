Initially, its expense {{restricted}} it to wealthy consumers, {{but the price}} gradually dropped, until by the 19th century its use was widespread. Introduced in the 16th century, coffee became popular by the 17th century, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> houses, the first opening in Oxford in 1650. Hot chocolate was a popular drink by the 17th century, long before it {{was used as a}} food. Chocolate bars were developed and marketed by three English Quaker-founded businesses, Joseph Fry's (1847), Rowntree's (1862), and Cadbury's (1868).|$|E

25|$|The Mariani {{family of}} Yauco decided on two {{courses of action}} which would {{strengthen}} their position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> industry.

The visit to Europe was a success and thus Puerto Rico became an important member of the worldwide coffee industry.|$|E
25|$|The {{external}} difficulties had far-reaching consequences. The {{government was}} forced to suspend part of the country's debt payments and eventually to impose exchange controls. Excess coffee production led to increasing interventions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> market. The state programs to support coffee prices went bankrupt in 1930. To avoid further decreases in coffee prices, the central government bought huge amounts of coffee, which was then destroyed.

500|$|Nurkse {{states that}} if {{demand for the}} output of one sector rises, due to the {{complementary}} nature of demand, the demand for the output of other industries will also experience a rise. Paul Rosenstein-Rodan spoke of a similar concept called [...] "indivisibility of demand" [...] which hypothesises that if large investments are made in {{a large number of}} industries simultaneously, an underdeveloped economy can become developed due to the phenomenon of complementary demand. However, both Nurkse and Rosenstein-Rodan only took into consideration the situation of industries that produce complementary goods. There are substitute goods too, which are in competition with each other. Thus if the state pumps in large investments into the car industry, for example, it will naturally lead to a rise in the demand for petrol. But if the state makes large scale investments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> sector of a country, the tea sector will suffer.|$|E
