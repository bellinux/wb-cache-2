5|$|The {{watershed}} can {{be divided}} into two hydrologic areas with different infiltration rates. The northern area, comprising about 40percent of the watershed, consists of the Portland Terraces, and the southern consists of the Boring Hills and the Kelso Slope. Most of the rain that <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northern area percolates into the ground, and most of the rain that <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> southern area runs quickly into the creek or its tributaries. Rain that <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north generally has a more gradual, longer-lasting effect, sustaining the base flow of the creek during dry periods.|$|E

5|$|In the Agni Purana, as the enchanted Shiva follows Mohini, {{drops of}} his semen <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and become lingas, Shiva's symbols. His semen also generates the monkey-god Hanuman, who helps Vishnu's avatar Rama in his fight against Ravana in the Ramayana. Shiva Purana says {{that by the}} mere glimpse of Mohini, Shiva spurts out his seed. The seed was {{collected}} and poured into the ear of Anjani, who gave birth to Hanuman, the incarnation of Shiva. The latter is retold in the Thai and Malaysian version of the Ramayana. Though Hanuman strings from Shiva's seed, he is also considered as a combined son of Vishnu and Shiva.|$|E

5|$|Stress in Mongolian is nonphonemic (does not {{distinguish}} different meanings) {{and thus is}} considered to depend entirely on syllable structure. But scholarly opinions on stress placement diverge sharply. Most native linguists, regardless of which dialect they speak, claim that stress <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first syllable. Between 1941 and 1975, several Western scholars proposed that the leftmost heavy syllable gets the stress. Yet other positions were taken in works published between 1835 and 1915.|$|E

5|$|Words {{with three}} or more syllables, {{if they are not}} compounds, are mostly loanwords, usually derived from Pali, Sanskrit, or more recently, French. They are {{nonetheless}} adapted to Khmer stress patterns. Primary stress <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final syllable, with secondary stress on every second syllable from the end. Thus in a three-syllable word, the first syllable has secondary stress; in a four-syllable word, the second syllable has secondary stress; in a five-syllable word, the first and third syllables have secondary stress, and so on. Long polysyllables are not often used in conversation.|$|E
