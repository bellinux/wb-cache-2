40|$|In an XML Data Store (XDS), {{importing}} {{documents from}} external sources {{is a very}} frequent operation. Since a document import consists {{of a large number}} of individual node inserts, it is essentially a small bulkload operation. Hence, efficient bulkload support is crucial for XDSs. Essentially, XML bulkload is the transformation of an XML parser’s output into the XDS’s persistent storage structures. This involves two major subtasks: (1) Partitioning the documents ’ logical tree structure into subtrees smaller than a disk page in a way that is both space-efficient an suitable for later processing. (2) Mapping the subtrees to the XDS’s <b>internal</b> <b>page</b> representation. In enterprise-scale environments with very large documents and/or very many parallel bulkloads, task (1) is particularly challenging, as not only disk space consumption, but also CPU and main-memory usage are important factors. In this article, we (1) discuss requirements for an XML bulkload module, (2) examine existing algorithms for tree partitioning with respect to their applicability as XML bulkload algorithms, (3) derive a new tree partitioning algorithm, (4) present the design and implementation of the bulkload module used in our Natix XDS, and (5) evaluate the implementation. ...|$|E
40|$|DESK is a WYSIWYG {{editor for}} dynamic web pages that are {{generated}} from an explicit ontology-based domain model [3]. DESK provides a significant scope of customization functionalities for dynamic pages with maximum ease of use, relieving users {{from having to}} edit the <b>internal</b> <b>page</b> generation code. In this paper we describe DESK-H, the monitoring module of DESK, that tracks all user actions in the DESK HTML editor and outputs a high-level semantic history of editing actions. The purpose of DESK-H goes beyond its current use in DESK: it provides an enriched model of user actions that can be exploited by other tools to carry through a Programming By Example (PBE) [1] approach. DESK-H works under the following assumptions: � The web pages DESK-H operates on are dynamically generated by a complementary generation module as the user navigates over an information space. � The information space is modeled as a semantic network (a graph) of domain objects with attributes and relations according to an explicit ontology. � Hyperspace navigation is understood as a traversal of the semantic network, so that each time a node is attained, a web page is generated for that node, selecting pieces of the node contents, and possibly of surrounding nodes, {{to make up the}} page...|$|E
40|$|Estuda-se a leitura e a interação feminina nos grandes jornais impressos, sob o enfoque da Ciência da informação, linha de pesquisa Informação, Cultura e Sociedade, no Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciência da Informação, da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais PPGECI/UFMG. Ao {{considerar}} os meios de comunicação mediadores de informações, além de produtores e reprodutores de padrões sociais e culturais, procurou-se identificar os elementos necessários para inserir a mulher como leitora de jornais de referência e como ela se reporta e interage com aqueles que constroem e divulgam a notícia. Discorre-se sobre a produção da informação através de uma linguagem masculina, sobre como a mulher se insere neste contexto, e sobre os possíveis impactos que a informação jornalística traz para o gênero feminino. Para tanto, foi elaborada uma base conceitual de idéias defendidas por teóricos da Ciência da Informação, da Comunicação, da Lingüística/Análise do discurso e do Gênero. Desenvolveu-se uma entrevista em profundidade com oito leitoras do jornal Estado de Minas, a qual serviu de pré-teste à pesquisa aplicada por telefone a outras 172; analisou-se o discurso de 30 capas do jornal e de matérias internas que tinham a mulher como personagem, às quais fotos e textos faziam referência; e foram contabilizadas quantas correspondências enviadas a seções de cartas à redação de sete jornais brasileiros, entre eles o Estado de Minas, estavam assinadas por mulheres e quantas por homens, também num período de 30 dias. Os dados permitem concluir que a mulher, quase a metade do público leitor dos grandes jornais brasileiros, os lê principalmente em busca de informação sobre diversos temas, em especial a política, acontecimentos locais, cultura e temas tidos como específicos do mundo feminino, como moda e família. Ela utiliza as informações para formar sua opinião e para interagir socialmente; porém prefere silenciar quando o assunto é publicar sua visão dos fatos e acontecimentos, provavelmente movida pelo {{status quo}} do feminino, que a mantém como sujeito coadjuvante do homem, inclusive nas páginas dos jornais. The present paper looks into female reading and interaction {{in the main}} newspapers, in the approach of Information Science, research line Information, Culture and Society within the Information Science Graduation Studies Program of the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Upon considering the communication media as information mediators, besides producers and reproducers {{of social and cultural}} patterns, it identifies the necessary elements to include women as newspaper reference readers as well as the way they report themselves and interact with those that "build up" and divulge the news. The study talks about information production through a male language, how women are included in that context and the possible impacts of journalistic information onto the female gender. For that, it was built a conceptual basis of ideas that are backed up by theorists of Information Science as well as Communication and Linguistics/ discourse and gender analysis. It also develops an in depth interview with eight female readers of the newspaper Estado de Minas, which served the purpose of pre-test to the survey carried out over the phone with other 172 women; discourse analysis was carried over 30 newspaper front pages as well as <b>internal</b> <b>page</b> articles that had women as characters and to which photos and texts referred; and also records how many letters to the editor were sent to seven Brazilian newspapers, among which is the Estado de Minas, which were signed by women compared to how many were signed by men, both over the period of 30 days. The data allow one to conclude that women, almost half of the readers of the main Brazilian newspapers, read them mainly in search for information on various topics especially politics, local events, culture and the so considered female specific such as fashion and family. It was also concluded that information interferes in the readers` opinion as well as it helps them socialize. Nevertheless women prefer to "silence" when it comes to publishing their opinion, probably moved by the female status quo that many times only allows women a supporting role compared to mens, including, and particularly, in the pages of newspapers...|$|E

40|$|A Wiki is a collaboratively-written website, {{also known}} as a Wiki space driven by Wiki server {{software}} implemented with any programming language. Wiki supports hyperlinks and has a simple text syntax for creating new pages and crosslinks between <b>internal</b> <b>pages</b> on the fly. Its open editing concept allows users to freely create and edit web page content using any web browser. Like many simple concepts, open editing has profound and subtle effects on Wiki usage. Anybody can add, edit, and maybe delete pages of the Wiki. That is why a vandal is able to damage or abuse a Wiki by deleting parts of the Wiki site, defacing a page or uploading files in order to use the Wiki as an interim storage. The management of a Wiki gets clumsy if there is just one administrator who has to adjust the damage in the entire Wiki space. The assessment of these problems depends on the Wiki application area.

40|$|Thumbnails are {{typically}} miniature product images displayed on one {{page of a}} Web site and hyperlinked to other pages in the site. As a type of online product display, thumbnails are used to attract Web surfers to enter the internal environment (i. e., <b>internal</b> <b>pages)</b> of a virtual store. Thumbnails are often organized in rectangular arrays; when consumers view such an array, the rectangular configuration is likely to activate an eye-movement (scanning) routine in the consumers' memory that causes them to scan the array {{in a manner similar}} to their reading of text. The presence of the routine and its influence on consumers' scanning of thumbnails are supported by the results of an eye-tracking experiment reported in this article. The experiment shows that consumers process information in the middle and left regions of a thumbnail array to a greater extent than they do in the right regions, and that they can find a particular product more quickly if it is placed in the middle and left regions. As expected, the results are consistent with the dominant reading direction of the participants in the experiment. In demonstrating differing levels of processing for items located across an array, the findings have significant marketing implications. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
