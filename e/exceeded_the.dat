In these reports a risk-assessment procedure was carried out for those compounds which were detected in concentrations above the EC standard for drinking water of 0. 1 mug/l. In this report the detection-limit has been taken as starting-point for risk-assessment. In the "Haarlemmermeer" 22 pesticides and related compounds <b>exceed</b> <b>the</b> detection limit. 10 pesticides and related compounds <b>exceed</b> <b>the</b> ecologically safe value.
