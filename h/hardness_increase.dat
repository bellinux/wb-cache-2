40|$|The {{effect of}} {{clustering}} during natural aging {{of three different}} Al-Mg-Sialloys with equal Mg/Si-ratios, but different Mg+Si contents have beenstudied through hardness measurements and transmission electron mi-croscopy (TEM). Hardness measurements were performed both duringnatural aging (NA) and after various NA times followed by subsequentartificial aging for all alloys, while TEM-investigations were performedon selected samples. The results from the experiments were comparedand the existence of three different clustering processes were discovered. The first process was established to be Si-Si clustering causing a slighthardness increase during natural aging and a strong hardness increaseafter subsequent artificial aging. The second process {{was found to be}}Mg-Mg clustering causing a significant <b>hardness</b> <b>increase</b> during naturalaging, and a clear decrease in hardness after subsequent artificial aging. The third process was found to be Mg-Si clustering and simultaneoustransformation of mono-clusters into co-clusters. This combined processcauses a <b>hardness</b> <b>increase</b> both during natural aging and after subse-quent artificial aging. The <b>hardness</b> <b>increase</b> is caused by a refinementof alloy microstructure including a higher number of smaller &# 148; needles. This precipitate type was observed for all alloys and conditions. Thenegative effect of Mg-Mg clusters on precipitation hardness is suggestedto be related to the repulsion of Si from these clusters. This hinders theco-clustering of Mg and Si in the areas surrounding these clusters. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{hardening}} behaviour of three cold-worked platinum alloys, Pt 5 at% Mo, Pt 5 wt% Ru and Pt 5 wt% Cu, {{has been investigated}} through a systematic series of heat treatments. All three of the experimental alloys showed a <b>hardness</b> <b>increase</b> during annealing within a specific temperature range. The hardness of the Pt-Mo and Pt-Ru alloys was found to increase rapidly at annealing temperatures above the recrystallisation temperature, with the final hardness similar to the original coldworked hardness. The hardness of Pt-Cu showed an increase of up to 30 % at low annealing temperatures of between 200 °C and 500 °C. In addition, the Pt-Cu alloy also showed the increased hardness found in Pt-Mo and Pt-Ru at high annealing temperatures, but the <b>hardness</b> <b>increase</b> was not to the same extent. Specimens subjected to the annealing treatments were studied by means of optical, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, {{in order to determine}} the effect of annealing on microstructure and structural order. Resistivity, XRD and OTA techniques were employed in order to study the mechanisms of ordering with temperature, but these techniques did not produce any significant results. It was concluded that the most likely cause for the <b>hardness</b> <b>increase</b> observed in all three experimental alloys was due to a change in structural order upon annealing. The Pt-Mo and Pt-Ru alloys hardened through an increase in short-range order at annealing temperatures above the recrystallisation temperature.

40|$|AbstractUltra-hard {{materials}} that are chemically inert and thermally stable at high temperatures are desirable for enhancing machining and wear performance in demanding chemical and thermal environments. Single and polycrystalline diamonds are the hardest tool materials; however, at high temperatures, diamond reacts with ferrous alloys, losing its chemical inertness and thermal stability. In contrast, cubic boron nitride (cBN) has exceptional chemical and thermal stability but has much lower hardness (35 - 45 GPa). Increasing the hardness of BN is expected to fill the property gap in state-of-the-art tool materials as shown and to generate huge industrial interest for meeting the stringent design requirements such as machining optical surfaces and reducing the cost and time for machining ferrous materials. A novel laser/waterjet heat treatment (LWH) process is investigated to enhance the surface hardness of a dual phase boron nitride (BN) material composed of 50 % cubic and 50 % wurtzite phases. Results indicate that experimentally measured <b>hardness</b> <b>increase</b> {{is dependent on the}} processing parameter such as laser fluence and overlap between heat treatment passes.

40|$|The {{internal}} {{order in}} the amorphous state of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), prepared either by rapid cooling from the melt or by thermal annealing of melt pressed films above Tg, has been studied using the microhardness technique. The <b>hardness</b> <b>increase</b> contribution due to physical aging, {{as well as the}} influence of the cooling rate on the hardness values of the glassy samples are independently discussed. The rate of creep under the indenter (creep constant) for these materials has been also investigated. It is found that the largest value for the creep constant corresponds to the highest cooling rate of the rapidly quenched samples (7500 °C/s), and to the starting melt pressed films. In addition, results reveal that the samples, showing the lowest degree of chain ordering, contain the lowest density of >embryonic> or >ordered> nanoregions; the latter controlling the viscoelastic behavior, as well as the induction time for cold crystallization. The isothermal crystallization of amorphous samples with different degree of internal order, studied by calorimetry, and the <b>hardness</b> <b>increase</b> occurring during the induction period prior to crystallization, are also comparatively discussed.

40|$|Many newly {{manufactured}} {{components are}} subject to a run-in procedure. It is commonly accepted that performing running-in {{at a fraction of}} the target load is beneficial due to a reduction in the surface roughness of the interacting surfaces. During this process, many changes take place within the surface layer including transformations in surface roughness, chemistry, and microstructure. These transformations can contribute to changes in the surface mechanical behavior of the components. The objective of this study was to understand how the surface hardness of 16 MnCr 5 bearing steel evolved during running-in and how varying contact pressure and initial composite roughness affected this evolution. The evolution of the tribofilm formed by zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate (ZDDP) and how it contributed to the measured hardness was also analyzed. The results indicated a higher initial composite roughness led to greater gains in hardness as compared to higher contact pressure during the running-in process. Tribofilm growth appeared to have little to no significant effect on the measured surface <b>hardness</b> <b>increase</b> during running-in and the primary contributor to the observed <b>hardness</b> <b>increase</b> was work hardening. The results of this study can inform engineers and manufacturers in their efforts to optimize running-in procedures, thereby increasing the efficiency and durability of their service components...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: The structural mechanism of surface layer development was determined {{and the effect of}} alloying parameters, gas protection method, and thickness of paste layer applied onto the steel surface on structure refinement and influence of these factors on the mechanical properties of surface layer was studied. Findings: The fine grained martensite structure is responsible for <b>hardness</b> <b>increase</b> of the alloyed layer. The dependence is presented of micro-hardness change on the laser beam effect on the treated surface, and especially the <b>hardness</b> <b>increase</b> in the alloyed layer.

In this study tungsten-ion implantation has been used to simulate the damage caused by neutrons in pure tungsten and tungsten 5 wt% rhenium. This damaged layer is only 300 nm deep so conventional mechanical tests cannot be used to investigate it. Nanoindentation has been used to measure the change in hardness as a function of six damage levels (0 dpa, 0. 07 dpa, 0. 4 dpa, 1. 2 dpa, 13 dpa and 33 dpa). In pure tungsten the <b>hardness</b> <b>increase</b> is seen to saturate by 0. 4 dpa at ≈ 0. 8 GPa. Transmission electron microscopy of the damage structure sees a similar saturation of the loop volume number density at the same damage level. In the tungsten 5 wt% rhenium the increase in hardness is constant between 0. 07 and 1. 2 dpa, ≈ 0. 85 GPa. The loop volume number density as measured using TEM is also shows little change in this region.
