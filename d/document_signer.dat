We have previously demonstrated a CES Extraction Policy for fragment grouping {{to allow the}} <b>document</b> <b>signer</b> to designate which subsets of the original document are valid subdocuments. Extending this ability, we introduce a new Hierarchical Grouping Extraction Policy that is more powerful, and for which the encoding is dramatically smaller, than the existing Grouping Extraction Policy. This new Extraction Policy maps naturally onto the hierarchically structured documents commonly found in digital libraries. After giving a motivating example involving digital libraries we then conjecture {{as to how to}} enrich their functionality through the use of CESs. We also show how to implement the new extraction policy using XML signatures with a custom transform along with an improved design for the XML signature structure in order to achieve CES functionality...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of {{upgrading}} passports to an electronic version {{is making it}} hard for criminals or anybody to counterfeit or illegally duplicate them. A practical way of doing so is {{through the use of}} digital signatures because it is computationally hard to counterfeit them. So all the contents of e-passports are now digitally signed by the <b>Document</b> <b>Signer</b> of the issuing country. The e-passport has thus achieved its central objective however it suffers from several security and privacy issues. Many of these issues are due to the technology being used in it. For example, use of RFID provides platform for skimming, tracking and hotlisting etc. Similarly, possibility of eavesdropping in the communication is always there. The current protocols used by the e-passports have also not been designed with adequate security. The standard put forward by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the body responsible for standardizing protocols related to e-passports, suffers from several security issues. Many of these issues threaten the privacy of the e-passport owner. An improved version of it, as proposed by European Union (EU) is known as Enhanced Access Control (EAC). But it also suffers from some inaccuracies. So it very important to analyze these issues and put forward a better solution. This thesis analyzes the security and privacy issues in these protocols. It highlights several weaknesses in the ICAO s protocol and EAC. It then proposes a more secure and better protocol, named Secure Electronic Passport Access Protocol (SEPAP). SEPAP makes the terminal authentication more accurate and the design of the protocol itself mandates terminal to be authenticated before the e-passport chip. So, it is more dependable then EAC or other e-passport protocols. In addition to informal analyses, the thesis also performs formal verification of this proposed protocol. Formal verification has been done with ProVerif and Scyther. It is equally important to see if the primitives necessary for the protocol can be practically implemented. So the thesis also provides a sample implementation of the protocol. Finally, the thesis attempts to see if e-passports can be used in other areas as well, besides border control. As a case study, the thesis performs this analysis on electronic voting and puts forward some recommendations on how e-passports, following different e-passport protocols, may be used with different e-voting schemes. </p...|$|E

Admissible alterations do not invalidate the signature {{and do not}} involve the signer. These properties make them a versatile tool for several application domains, like e-business and health care. We implemented one secure redactable and three secure sanitizable signature schemes on secure, but computationally bounded, smart card. This allows for a secure and practically usable key management and meets legal standards of EU legislation. To gain speed we securely divided the computing tasks between the powerful host and the card; and we devise a new accumulator to yield a useable redactable scheme. The performance analysis of the four schemes shows only a small performance hit {{by the use of}} an off-the-shelf card...|$|R
40|$|An {{electronic}} voting {{system is a}} technology {{that is expected to}} be available in the future. It will decrease the cost of voting; {{we will be able to}} vote anytime and anywhere by using PC from our home, or a cellar phone. Voting protocols must have two security properties, Receipt-freeness and Universal verifiability. receipt-freeness means that anyone cannot prove the content of his vote to someone else. universal verifiability means that anyone can verify the result of voting. Many techniques have been developed to realize the system. Mix-net and blind signatures are the most popular techniques. Mix-net is a set of mix servers. Given a list of messages, a server randomizes the sort of the list (shuffles) and outputs the resulting list to the next server. By repeating this task the final output messages realize anonymous. Blind signatures also realize anonymity. In blind signatures, when a <b>signer</b> signs a <b>document,</b> the <b>signer</b> cannot see the content of the document. In the case of voting systems, a special party such as administrator or voting committee generates a blind signature fo...|$|R
40|$|Optimized Public Key Infrastructures are {{traditional}} PKI in which end users may optimize the signatures of their <b>documents,</b> replacing the <b>signer’s</b> validation data with Optimized Certificates (OC). OCs carry the signer’s identification and public key, but are issued {{for a specific}} time, i. e., fields notBefore and notAfter have the same value, thus there are no reasons to revoke them. The OC’s certification path {{is supposed to be}} shorter and uses Micali’s revocation scheme. Furthermore, OCs include signed document’s hashcodes, working also as time-stamps. Therefore, OCs are useful to replace signed document’s validation data by one smaller and easier to verify. Finally, when OCs become invalid due to cryptographic algorithm weakness and limits in the validity periods of their certificate chains, they can be easily replaced by new ones, thus this proposal is suitable for efficient long term archiving...|$|R
40|$|End user {{computing}} environments, e. g. web browsers and PC operating systems, are {{the target}} {{of a large number of}} attacks, both online and offline. The nature of these attacks varies from simple online attacks, such as user tracking using cookies, to more sophisticated attacks on security protocols and cryptographic algorithms. Other methods of attack exist that target end user applications that utilise and interact with cryptographic functions provided by the PC operating system. After providing a general introduction to the security techniques and protocols used in this thesis, a review of possible threats to end user computing environments is given, followed by a discussion of the countermeasures needed to combat these threats. The contributions of this thesis include three new approaches for enhancing the security of end user systems, together with an analysis and a prototype implementation of an end user security enhancement tool. The following paragraphs summarise the three main contributions of this thesis. Digitally signing a digital document is a straightforward procedure; however, when the digital document contains dynamic content, the digital signature may remain valid but the viewed document may not be the same as the document when viewed by the signer. A new solution is proposed to solve the problem; the main idea behind the solution is to make the application aware of the sensitive cryptographic function being requested. In order to verify a digital signature computed on a document or any other object (e. g. an executable), access to the public key corresponding to the private key used to sign the document is required. Normally, the public part of the key is made available in a digital 'certificate', which is made up of the public key of the signer, the name of the signer, and other data, all signed using the private signing key of a trusted third party known as a Certification Authority (CA). To verify such a certificate, and thereby obtain a trusted copy of the <b>document</b> <b>signer's</b> public key, a trusted copy of the CA's public key is required. If a malicious party can insert a fake CA public key into the list of CA public keys stored in a PC, then this party could potentially do considerable harm to that PC, since this malicious party could then forge signatures apparently created by other entities. A method of achieving such an attack without attracting the user's attention is presented in this thesis. Countermeasures that can be deployed to prevent the insertion of a fake root public key are discussed. A suggested solution that can be used to detect and remove such fake keys is presented, and a prototype implementation of this solution is described. SSL/TLS supports mutual authentication, i. e. both server and client authentication, using public key certificates. However, this optional feature of SSL/TLS is not widely used because most end users do not have a certified public key. Certain attacks rely on this fact, such as web spoofing and phishing attacks. A method for supporting client-side SSL authentication using trusted computing platforms is proposed. The proposed approach makes a class of phishing attacks ineffective; moreover, the proposed method can also be used to protect against other online attacks...|$|R
40|$|Public-key cryptosystems {{are a new}} {{infrastructure}} of the coming IT society because they assure the security of digital documents and entities related to these documents. Among them, digital signature schemes are commonly used since they can verify the integrity of signed <b>documents</b> and <b>signers.</b> Since the integrity check of the digital signature schemes is strict, proper alternations such as the sanitization (which is a common technology for paper documents) are prohibited and rejected. Of course, this property is desired as digital signature schemes, however, in some cases, we require such proper alternations on signed documents. For a wider use of digital signature schemes, this thesis focuses on a signature scheme in which proper alternations (sanitizations) are permitted but improper alternations (forgeries) are prohibited (sanitizable signature scheme). Especially, we analyze {{the security of a}} sanitizable signature scheme proposed by Miyazaki et al. in 2005, and propose a new sanitizable signature scheme. On the other hand, in this ubiquitous society, identifications via digital signatures are processed on mobile devices such as mobile phones or smartcards. In such low-power devices, side channel attacks are becoming a new threat. In this attack, an adversary observes side channel information (such as computation timings, power consumptions, or electromagnetic fields) and detects the secret information hidden in the device. In this thesis, we propose two efficient countermeasures for elliptic curve cryptosystems (ECC). The first countermeasure uses the Montgomery ladder for scalar multiplications and establishes a new addition-and-doubling formula. The second countermeasure uses the SIMD operations for parallelized scalar multiplications. 電気通信大学 200...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo ensure {{integrity}} and originality of digital information, digital signatures were proposed to provide both authority and non-repudiation. However, without an authenticated time-stamp we can neither trust signed <b>documents</b> when the <b>signer's</b> signature key was lost, stolen, or accidentally compromised, nor solve the cases when the signer himself repudiates the signing, {{claiming that he}} has accidentally lost his signature key. Based on relative temporal authentication, several linking schemes for digital time-stamping have been proposed to solve this problem. However, these schemes suffer from the forward forgery which {{is an attempt to}} stamp a present time-stamp on a past document by an unauthorized one. In addition, the verification cost in these schemes is too high because it is dependent upon the number of the issued time-stamps. In this paper, we propose four time-stamped signature schemes that are based on absolute temporal authentication. These proposed schemes are very efficient in verifying the validity of time-stamped signatures and are quite secure against the forward forgery. It is natural that the time-stamped signature schemes based on absolute temporal authentication suffer from the weakness when the signer colludes with the Time-Stamping Service. To combat the collusion problem, time-stamped signature schemes with hybrid temporal authentication are therefore proposed...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is on two types of handshapes: those that {{represent}} the object (2 ̆ 2 object 2 ̆ 2 handshapes, referred to as 2 ̆ 7 entity 2 ̆ 7 classifier handshapes in the sign language literature) and those that represent the manipulation of the object (2 ̆ 2 handling 2 ̆ 2 handshapes). These handshapes are studied in native Deaf signing and hearing gesturing groups at three ages-younger child, older child, and adult. An experiment was designed in which short 2 ̆ 7 vignettes 2 ̆ 7 involving intransitive and transitive events were shown to {{participants in the study}} groups. They responded manually. Signers signed the event descriptions; gesturers gestured their event descriptions without voice. ^ Two grammatical features guide the distribution of the productive use of classifier handshapes at the syntactic and phonological levels of analysis: (1) the intransitive/transitive opposition of object and handle classifier handshapes; and (2) the selected finger complexity assigned to entity, as opposed to handle, classifier handshapes (Benedicto 2 ̆ 6 Brentari, 2004; Eccarius 2 ̆ 6 Brentari, 2007). This project <b>documents</b> how <b>signers</b> and gesturers show different distributional patterns of handshape with respect to these two linguistic features. Results conclude that the presence of an adequate language model is required for the emergence of sign language linguistic properties to appear. ^ Findings contribute to the limited research of American Sign Language (ASL) acquisition. The association of object and handle handshapes to intransitive and transitive events develops with time. Errors from the descriptions of intransitive and transitive events demonstrate strikingly different patterns; young gesturing children produce handling handshapes more often in expected contexts (transitive events) than young signing children, indicating that native signers are not using a gestural strategy when faced with linguistic complexity of expressing transitive events with classifiers. The association of handshapes with high selected finger complexity to entity classifiers is realized at a young age (before age four). In addition, the inventory of classifier handshapes used to represent objects in intransitive event descriptions increases and expands in selected finger complexity with time. ...|$|R
