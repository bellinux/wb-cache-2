Today, they do not only supply, store, prepare and dispense medicines with ensured quality, but they also provide professional services based on the concept of pharmaceutical care and <b>good</b> <b>pharmacy</b> <b>practice.</b> In this paper, detailed review on the current legislative regulating the status and practice of the community and hospital pharmacies in some EU-member countries and in Macedonia is given. The implementation of the concept of pharmaceutical care and <b>good</b> <b>pharmacy</b> <b>practice</b> in selected EU member-countries, Great Britain, Germany and Slovenia, and in Croatia as a future EU member as well as in Macedonia is also discussed.

40|$|XXX Pharmacy is an independently-owned retail {{pharmacy}} in Johannesburg. <b>Good</b> <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>Practice</b> standards make it mandatory for pharmacists to provide “pharmaceutical care”, a highly patient-centred approach to providing pharmaceutical services. Since XXX Pharmacy {{has a high}} patient load, a shortage of dispensary staff and a strategic focus on operational efficiency, the question arose whether pharmacists comply fully with <b>Good</b> <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>Practice</b> standards {{for the provision of}} pharmaceutical care. Non-compliance poses operational risks that could undermine the business’s financial performance. The research statement was thus that the current performance management system undermines compliance with <b>Good</b> <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>Practice</b> standards for the provision of pharmaceutical care to patients. A triangulation approach was used. The quantitative research method, in which 200 patients completed a questionnaire, investigated two research objectives: (i) whether the pharmacy complies with <b>Good</b> <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>Practice</b> standards for pharmaceutical care; and (ii) whether there is a relationship between patients’ race or gender and their responses. The qualitative research method involved conducting individual semi-structured interviews with all four dispensary employees to achieve another two research objectives: (i) to determine whether the provision of pharmaceutical care is viewed as a key performance area by pharmacists; and (ii) to investigate what aspects of the implementation of the performance management system are viewed as enabling or undermining the provision of pharmaceutical care...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{principles}} of pharmaceutical care {{are embedded in}} the concept of <b>Good</b> <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>Practice</b> (GPP). GPP is poorly applied in community pharmacies not only in Asian countries, but even in United States and Europe. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and practice of the community pharmacists in Iran, regarding GPP. Methods: A total of 794 pharmacists were evaluated with a reliable and validated KAP (Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice) questionnaire regarding GPP in September 2008. Results: The most important finding {{in the present study was}} the pharmacists’ low knowledge (Mean= 13. 42) and practice (Mean= 29. 85) level about GPP, while their attitude towards this subject was at a high level (Mean= 74. 83). Increase in their knowledge of <b>good</b> <b>pharmacy</b> <b>practice</b> aligned with an increase in their attitudes towards this issue. Also increase in our pharmacists’ knowledge and attitude aligned with an increase in quality of their practice. Conclusion: The current practice of Iranian community pharmacists needs further improvement. National pharmaceutical organizations should organize educational programs for the community pharmacists to equip them for their main role in community practice: promoting rational drug use.

40|$|Background: There is {{substantial}} evidence of poor dispensing practices with inadequate {{packaging and labelling}} of medicines, and limited advice on their usage in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). We examined the labelling and packaging of medicines identified during a survey of 1322 households in six regions of Sri Lanka between 2010 and 2013 conducted using the World Health Organization (WHO) methodology for household surveys. We compared medicines obtained from public and private sources and asked interviewees if they understood how to take the medicines. Methods: Packaging was considered adequate when the primary package was an envelope or closable container holding only one medicine. Adequate labels were legible and included medicine name, dose and expiration date. Interviewers assessed whether respondents knew how to take the medicines. Results: Of 1322 households, 1253 households (94. 8 %) {{had at least one}} medicine; 84 % were classified as western medicines and 16 % traditional medicines. Of 5756 western medicines identified, 82. 1 % were adequately packaged, 43. 3 % adequately labelled and 41. 4 % both adequately packaged and labelled. Participants stated that they understood the label and knew how to take 96 % of the medicines. Private medicine sources had more adequately packaged medicines than public sources (87. 7 % vs 73. 5 %; OR 2. 58, 95 % CI 2. 23, 2. 99) and more adequately labelled medicines (52. 2 % vs 27. 4 %; OR 2. 90, 95 % CI 2. 57, 3. 26). Conclusions: Inadequate packaging and labelling of medicines remain a concern in Sri Lanka. Commitment to <b>Good</b> <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>Practices,</b> investments in staff education and training and adequate dispensing resources (containers and labels), particularly in the public sector, are needed to address sub-optimal dispensing practices.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the quality of pharmacy practice in CP according to RUD principles. The following data were a part of an interventional study in which 84 community pharmacists in the Umraniye district of Istanbul were evaluated by face to face interviews and an unannounced simulated case scenario in 2002. The average dispensing time, dispensing practice, and adequate labelling were evaluated as rationality indicators. Our results showed that 32 % of the pharmacists were not present in their pharmacies during the simulation studies. Only 40. 5 % of the prescriptions were dispensed by the pharmacists. Forty four percent of the pharmacy employees had no more than a primary school degree. Half of the patients applying to a pharmacy had no prescription. The average dispensing time for a single drug was 149 seconds in simulated cases although the pharmacists declared 287 seconds in the questionnaires. All pharmacists reported that they explained to the patients how to administer their drugs but only 43 % of the prescriptions were adequately labelled and only 6. 5 % included a verbal warning by the dispensers of possible interactions.

In some cases professional nurses have to leave the unit in search of medicine. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1. 2 gram for intravenous administration is prescribed to the majority of patients in the medical units in public South African hospitals. Yet there are intermitted insufficient stock levels and challenged inventory systems for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1. 2 gram in some public hospitals. This fact is positioned against the background of a South African health system that has undergone major changes since the fall of Apartheid in 1994 and amidst major positive changes, is still challenged by overburdened hospital admissions and a quadruple disease burden. The aim of this research was to enhance optimal levels of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1. 2 gram in medical units in public hospitals to ensure sufficient stock levels and timeous administration. The aim was achieved by identifying and describing the current supply chain of intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1. 2 gram in two medical units in a district (level 2) public hospital in the North West Province (from here referred only as North West) by identifying inefficiencies in the current supply chain and to formulate recommendations for management to enhance the supply chain of intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1. 2 gram to medical units in public hospitals. An exploratory case study approach was followed to explain the supply chain of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1. 2 gram by utilising a qualitative, descriptive, explorative and contextual design. A case study approach was chosen as it examined single units within the context of real life as environment, which in this case were medical units in a level two public hospital, North West. The case selection was motivated and described, followed by case records of policies and standard operational procedures. Field participants included all levels of nurses (professional, enrolled and auxiliary) in medical male and female units on day and night duty, and the head of pharmacy [n= 8]. Non-probable, purposive sampling was conducted according to inclusion criteria after all levels of ethical clearance and consent were granted. Three semi-structured individual interviews followed, after which two focus groups were conducted. Thematic analysis of transcriptions was done, followed by an analysis of case records regarding where after all results were integrated. Results indicated complex organisational, unit-specific and behavioural challenges that impact on the supply chain management of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1. 2 gram and insufficient stock levels are predominantly positioned within retailer and customer aspects of the supply chain. Despite well-formulated standard operational procedures, the realisation thereof lacks, implicating a greater need for managerial control. Recommendations were formulated for management to enhance the supply chain of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1. 2 gram in medical units in public South African hospitals integrated with <b>good</b> <b>pharmacy</b> <b>practices.</b> The close collaboration, mutual respect and effective communication between health professionals in the multi-professional team are reiterated.

40|$|The {{private sector}} is a {{dominant}} actor {{in the provision of}} pharmaceuticals, particularly in developing countries. Private provision of drugs has been associated with risks regarding availability, affordability, rational use and drug quality. Ensuring an effective regulatory framework is therefore a major challenge for governments, yet the capacity of regulatory authorities is often outstripped by private sector growth. In the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao P. D. R.), a poor, landlocked country in South East Asia, the private provision of drugs has increased dramatically since the liberalisation of the economy in the late 1980 s. This paper aims to describe the quality of the private pharmacy services in the Savannakhet province of Lao P. D. R. In order to do this, a monitoring instrument which serves to make the concept of <b>Good</b> <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>Practice</b> (GPP) operational was developed and applied to a sample of pharmacies. Service quality, as measured by three facility-specific indicators, showed a tendency to be lower in the most distant districts. Poor dispensing practices were manifest by a lack of information about drugs sold in 59 % of cases, drugs not being labelled in 47 % and different drugs being mixed in the same package in 26 % of cases. The prices of four sample drugs were slightly higher in the remote districts. A 10 -fold price difference for the same drug was recorded in one district. After reporting the findings, the paper discusses the possible influence of district and pharmacy variables on the quality of services, and goes on to discuss the price differences. It is concluded that further government interventions are needed in order {{to improve the quality of}} services and to focus regulatory action on a limited number of aspects, to ensure that drugs can be traced before trying to establish a comprehensive regulatory system.

40|$|As part of wider reforms {{within the}} {{pharmaceutical}} sector, the pharmaceutical care concept {{has been introduced}} in the Republic of Macedonia. This article provides discussion on current opportunities and challenges which pharmacy practice face in Macedonia.

40|$|SETTINGS: Private {{pharmacies}} in Hanoi, Viet Nam. OBJECTIVES: To {{explore the}} response of health care providers (HCPs) in private pharmacies to suspected tuberculosis (TB) patients. METHODS: A simulated patient method combined with an interview in 128 randomly selected private pharmacies and 10 private pharmacies near TB hospitals. RESULTS: In the simulated patient method and interview, respectively 59 (46 %) and 70 (55 %) of HCPs referred the TB suspect to general health care. Only 11 (9 %) referred the simulated patient to a TB care facility. Fifty-two (42 %) of the HCPs identified suspected TB from a fictitious case described on paper; 34 (27 %) were aware that free treatment was provided under the National Tuberculosis Programme (NTP). Knowledge about free NTP treatment predicted {{a higher rate of}} direct referrals to TB facilities (OR 5. 80, 95 %CI 1. 88 - 19. 62) and greater ability to identify suspected TB from a fictitious case on paper (OR 5. 14, 95 %CI 2. 36 - 11. 73).

40|$|Background: An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine whether}} pharmacists at one independently owned retail pharmacy were compliant with <b>Good</b> <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>Practice</b> (GPP) standards {{for the provision of}} pharmaceutical care to patients. It was hypothesised that the pharmacy's performance management system (PMS) undermines compliance with these standards, and thus the provision of pharmaceutical care. Method: A triangulation approach was used. The quantitative research method involved 200 patients who completed a questionnaire. The qualitative research method involved conducting individual, semi-structured interviews with all four dispensary employees. Results: At least 50 % of patients perceived that only two out of 10 pharmaceutical care services were always provided. All pharmacists agreed that the provision of pharmaceutical care was a key performance area, and there were several commendable aspects of the PMS. However, nine key weaknesses in the PMS were identified. These included inadequacies relating to the pharmacy's vision and mission statement; poor awareness of GPP standards; the absence of fundamental documentation, such as job descriptions, and performance appraisals; confusion regarding performance objectives; inadequate training and development; and misunderstandings regarding remuneration. Prominent findings are that time pressures contributed to difficulties in providing pharmaceutical care, and that a key performance target was to serve customers as quickly and efficiently as possible. Conclusion: These weaknesses in the PMS may have undermined compliance with GPP standards. Non-compliance increased the potential for patient harm, and posed operational risks that could have undermined the business's financial performance...|$|E

The Malaysian Pharmaceutical Society (MPS) introduced its benchmarking guidelines (BMG) in 2003 as a means to raise the professional standards of the community pharmacy practice in Malaysia. Therefore, this study aimed {{to determine the extent to}} which community pharmacies have adopted the BMG. A cross-sectional study was conducted using mail questionnaires, which were posted to all community pharmacies in Malaysia. A total of 371 questionnaires (29. 2 %) were returned. Only 51. 0 % of the respondents were aware of the BMG. The extent of compliance with the guidelines was 62. 6 + 21. 1 % (mean + standard deviation), with a median of 65 %. The type and ownership of the community pharmacies were significantly associated with compliance with certain aspects of the guidelines. The main problem in complying with the BMG was financial constraint, and this problem was more likely to occur with independent than with chain pharmacies. However, the respondents generally agreed that most aspects of the BMG could be achieved in less than five years. Since the level of awareness among community pharmacists regarding the BMG is low, the MPS should promote or publicise the BMG further. The BMG should be reviewed before being used as part of the criteria for the accreditation of community pharmacies, as proposed by the MPS to further improve the quality and standards of community pharmacies in Malaysia...|$|E

40|$|In Nigeria, a {{shift from}} the {{traditional}} pharmacist's role of dispensing and compounding of medications began in the 1980 s {{with the introduction of}} drug information services and unit dose dispensing systems in some hospitals. More than three decades after this, clinical <b>pharmacy</b> <b>practice</b> is still underdeveloped. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 49 purposefully sampled Nigerian stakeholders including hospital pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, doctors, policymakers and patient group representatives. Transcribed interviews were entered into the QSR NVivo 10 software and analysed using a thematic approach. Two major themes emerged from the study: (i) pharmacists' professional identity and (ii) the structure of hospital <b>pharmacy</b> <b>practice.</b> The results revealed an ongoing struggle by Nigerian hospital pharmacists to establish their clinical identities as many non-pharmacy stakeholders viewed their roles to be mainly supply-based. Barriers to the development of clinical <b>pharmacy</b> <b>practice</b> in Nigerian hospitals included pharmacists' lack of confidence, shortage of pharmacy staff, underutilisation of pharmacy technicians, lack of specialisation and clinical career structure, medical dominance and opposition, and lack of policies that support clinical <b>pharmacy</b> <b>practice.</b> Several years after its introduction, clinical <b>pharmacy</b> <b>practice</b> is yet to be fully developed in many hospitals.

40|$|BACKGROUND: People {{living with}} {{diabetes}} (PLD) have special needs {{which could be}} effectively and efficiently addressed at the stage of pharmaceutical care. We analyzed preferences of PLD in Kyiv for services that could be potentially implemented in a specialized pharmacy. METHODS: We used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit preferences for pharmacist’s consultation, possibility of testing, {{and the availability of}} special products. The pharmacy was described with 3 attributes having 2 levels and 2 attributes having 3 levels. The analysis is based on interviews with 98 PLD. Respondents were recruited either in the in-patient unit of Kyiv endocrinology center or through snow-ball approach between January 2012 and March 2012. The DCE part consisted of 12 choice tasks (orthogonal fractional factorial design). To reduce the number of choices per respondent, the DCE was split into two experiments of 6 choices each. Respondents were randomly assigned to either DCE. Logistic regression xtlogit was used to model DCE responses using STATA version 11. 0. RESULTS: Pharmacist’s consultation regarding the use of drugs, their compatibility, and special diet was the most important choice factor among PLD (marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) was 23. 38 UAH), followed by the possibility of controlling the blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels, (MWTP is 21. 68 UAH) and the availability of specialized products (MWTP is 13. 57 UAH). Time for purchase (including travel and waiting) did not significantly affect the choice of pharmacy. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents gave mostly meaningful answers to the DCE and the model is theoretically valid. PLD are willing to spend time on traveling to the specialized pharmacy with <b>Good</b> <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>Practice</b> GPP services. Conclusively, introduction of the pharmacy with special focus on PLD has good potential in Kyiv as they are ready to spend additional time and money to obtain proper services...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Effective Medicine Control is {{the essence}} of {{pharmaceutical}} service delivery and of financial management in Platinum Health Pharmacies. Platinum Health Pharmacies implement medicine control measures to enhance and optimise service delivery. As Platinum Health Pharmacies deliver a pharmaceutical service as business associates of Anglo Platinum, it serves the same workforce. The requirement of the pharmaceutical service delivery for Anglo Platinum is timely, appropriate and available medicine. Therefore, Platinum Health Pharmacies need to adhere to set criteria, those of ?<b>Good</b> <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>Practice</b> in South Africa? as applied to the control, procurement and prescribing of medication. The ordering and receiving of necessary medication forms {{a significant part of the}} criteria, as this is the source of medication to pharmacies. The subsequent management of medication as inventory and control over recall, storage, excess and disposal of expired medication serves the same purpose. Effective dispensing and distribution methods are therefore mandated to ensure timeously availability of correct medication. Finally, the success of effective medicine control is defined by the accuracy of the stock take ascertaining the results of managerial methods of medication. Platinum Health Pharmacies recorded an overall adherence level of 85 percent to the abovementioned criteria. This is a good indication of a strong, reliable and experienced pharmaceutical workforce that delivers an outstanding pharmaceutical service and is capable of maintaining effective medicine control. Although few shortcomings were identified, it is nevertheless recommended that Platinum Health Pharmacies plan the improvement of their risk management plans, and identify quality improvement projects in areas of medicine procurement. The implementation of key performance indicators, relevant to stock control, is also recommended. These, put into effect will assure optimisation of effective medicine control for Platinum Health Pharmacies, maintaining the benefits of cost containment and cost effective pharmaceutical service delivery.

40|$|Thesis (M. Pharm. (Pharmacy Practice)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. The {{objects of}} the South African Pharmacy Council {{in terms of}} the Pharmacy Act, 1974 (5311974) as amended are, inter alia, "to uphold and {{safeguard}} the rights of the general public to universally acceptable standards of pharmacy practice in both the private and the public sector" as well as "to establish, develop, maintain and control universally acceptable standards of practice of the various categories of persons required to be registered [...] . " One of the major difficulties health care providers worldwide are faced with is how to maintain a proper balance between the trio goals of health care, namely adequate access, high quality and acceptable costs (Li, 2003 : 192 - 193). Relatively little is known about such problems as do exist for patients regarding access to pharmaceutical services (Doucette et al., 1999 : 1268). Two main objectives were identified for this study, namely to investigate the demographic profile of community and institutional pharmacies registered with the South African Pharmacy Council; and to determine the standard of pharmaceutical services provided by these pharmacies. Inspection results of community and institutional pharmacies were obtained from the South African Pharmacy Council and extracted for the time period 1 January 2004 to 31 May 2005. To determine the demographic and geographic profile of these pharmacies, data of the Register of Pharmacies of the South African Pharmacy Council for August 2003, 2004 and 2005 were merged with the Census data of South Africa of 2001. It was found that the total number of pharmacies in both {{the public and private sectors}} increased with 2. 1 % (n= 68) from August 2003 to August 2005. Public and private pharmacies that provided services directly to patients increased with 6. 3 % (n= 33) and 1. 3 % (n= 35) from August 2003 to 2005. It was found that the Gauteng province was the best provided with registered pharmacies in South Africa, as only 0. 06 % (n= 5 783) of the population did not have any registered pharmacy available on municipality level. It was also revealed that the majority of inspections were carried out in Gauteng, whilst this province accounts for only 19. 7 % of the total population of South Africa. During the study period a total of 1178 community pharmacy inspections were carried out in 1103 community pharmacies (one or more inspections per pharmacy) representing 43 % (n= 2 550) of the total number of community pharmacies registered with the South African Pharmacy Council during May 2005. Nationally community pharmacies achieved a score of 92. 27 (+ 6. 65 per cent) for compliance with <b>Good</b> <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>Practice</b> guidelines. The lowest compliance score (73. 34 + 27. 49 per cent) was obtained for the availability of written standard operating procedures and the highest was for the promotion of public health (99. 02 + 6. 30 per cent). No practical significant differences (dc 0. 8) were found between the overall compliance scores obtained by community pharmacies of the different provinces. The highest compliance score was obtained by community pharmacies in the Free State (93. 09 + 4. 90 per cent), followed by Western Cape, Eastern Cape, Kwazulu Natal, Limpopo, Northern Cape, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and the North West. A total of 343 institutional pharmacy inspections (one or more inspections per pharmacy) were carried out in public and state subsidised institutions (n= 245), private institutions (n= 90) and mine hospitals (n= 5). These pharmacies represented 46 % of the total number of institutional pharmacies registered with the South African Pharmacy Council during May 2005. Nationally all institutional pharmacies (both private and public) achieved a score of 92. 49 + 8. 33 per cent for compliance with <b>Good</b> <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>Practice</b> guidelines for all above-mentioned aspects. Nationally public and state subsidised institutional pharmacies obtained a lower compliance score (91. 02 + 9. 08 per cent) than private institutional pharmacies (96. 39 + 3. 91 per cent). Lastly, a grading system was developed that was based on the results obtained through this study, in order to quantify the standard of pharmaceutical services provided by pharmacies in South Africa.

40|$|Background: <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>practice</b> {{research}} is one avenue through which new pharmacy services {{can be integrated}} into daily <b>pharmacy</b> <b>practice.</b> However, pharmacists’ participation in this research has not been well characterized. Drawing from the literature on work performance and personality traits, 4 hypotheses were developed to gain insight into pharmacists’ performance in a <b>pharmacy</b> <b>practice</b> research trial. Methods: This study was an observational, cross-sectional survey of pharmacists participating in a research trial. All pharmacists {{were asked to complete}} the Big Five Inventory (BFI), a validated, reliable instrument of personality traits. These results were then compared with measures of pharmacists’ performance in the trial. Results: Thirty pharmacists expressed interest in participating in the trial; 23 completed the BFI and 14 actively participated in the <b>pharmacy</b> <b>practice</b> research trial. No statistically significant differences were identified in the examination of the predetermined hypotheses. Exploratory analyses revealed significant relationships between the BFI trait of extroversion and pharmacists’ participation in the study, obtaining prescribing authority for the study and the number of patients lost to follow-up. Discussion: In addition to identifying a number of personality traits that have been shared by other samples of pharmacists, this work suggests the possibility of an interaction between pharmacists’ personality traits and their performance in a <b>pharmacy</b> <b>practice</b> research trial. Conclusion: Future research should better characterize the relationship between pharmacists’ personality traits and participation in <b>pharmacy</b> <b>practice</b> research trials to gain insight into the context of <b>pharmacy</b> <b>practice</b> and how pharmacists are integrating this research into their practices...|$|R
