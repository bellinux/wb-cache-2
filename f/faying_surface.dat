40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{aluminum}} alloy T-joints were welded using the laser stake-welding process. In {{order to improve}} the welding quality of the T-joints, an external electric current was used to aid the laser stake-welding process. The effects of the process parameters on the weld morphology, mechanical properties, and microstructure of the welded joints were analyzed and discussed in detail. The {{results indicate that the}} aided electric current should be no greater than a certain maximum value. Upon increasing the aided electric current, the weld width at the skin and stringer <b>faying</b> <b>surface</b> obviously increased, but there was an insignificant change in the penetration depth. Furthermore, the electric current and pressing force should be chosen to produce an expected weld width at the <b>faying</b> <b>surface,</b> whereas the laser power and welding speed should be primarily considered to obtain an optimal penetration depth. The tensile shear specimens failed across the <b>faying</b> <b>surface</b> or failed in the weld zone of the skin. The specimens that failed in the weld of the skin could resist a higher tensile shear load compared with specimens that failed across the <b>faying</b> <b>surface.</b> The microstructural observations and microhardness results demonstrated that the tensile shear load capacity of the aluminum alloy welded T-joint was mainly determined by the weld width at the <b>faying</b> <b>surface...</b>|$|E

The following are concluded. (1) The initial torque and the elapsed time for initial torque to it were affected by friction pressures and friction speeds described above for joining of same yield strength properties and weld <b>faying</b> <b>surface</b> diameter substrates.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} the friction welding condition and the weld <b>faying</b> <b>surface</b> properties on the tensile strength of the friction welded joint between pure titanium (Ti) and pure copper (OFC). The joint strength of the joint, which was made with the weld <b>faying</b> <b>surface</b> of the Ti side specimen finished with a surface grinding machine, was investigated. The joint did not have 100 % efficiency and OFC side fracture regardless of the friction welding conditions. When the joint was made with a friction pressure of 75 MPa, the joint efficiency was approximately 64 % regardless of the forge pressures, and all joints fractured at the weld interface, although that efficiency exceeded that of the joints made with other friction pressures. To improve the joint efficiency, one was made with a Ti side specimen whose weld <b>faying</b> <b>surface</b> was finished by buff polishing. The joint efficiency was increased to approximately 85 %, although the joint fractured at the weld interface. Moreover, a joint at a friction pressure of 75 MPa with a forge pressure of 270 MPa or higher was obtained with an OFC side fracture, although it did not achieve 100 % efficiency. The fact that the joint did not fracture at the OFC base metal was due to the mechanically mixed layer at the weld interface that depended on the maximum height of the Ti side weld <b>faying</b> <b>surface.</b> To clarify the reason why the joint did not achieve 100 % joint efficiency, the tensile strength of the OFC base metal with the addition of various compressive stresses was investigated. When the compressive stress was higher than the yield stress of the OFC base metal, its tensile strength was lower than that without a compressive load. Moreover, the tensile strength along the radial direction of the OFC base metal was also slightly lower than that of the longitudinal direction. Hence, the fact that the joint did not also achieve 100 % efficiency was due to the decrease in the tensile strength of the OFC base metal by the Bauschinger effect and the difference of the anisotropic property with as-manufactured condition...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{evaluation}} of stress intensity factors (SIFs) for cracks in mechanically fastened joints {{is one of}} the central issues in a damage tolerance analysis. Accurate stress intensity solutions may be difficult to determine due to geometric complexity along with variations in fastener load transfer and fastener interference and material thickness because of corrosion. Detailed finite element models that include specific aspects of fastener for lap joints analysis, but such representations are often impractical for large lap joints involving many fasteners. In order {{to reduce the number of}} degrees of freedom in a particular model, a methodology was implemented that efficiently depicts mechanical fasteners in lap joints using finite elements. Uncorroded and corroded lap joints with three crack scenarios were studied by the computationally efficient model. The effects of pillowing corrosion and fastener interference were also included in the model. The results show that the effect of MSD and thinning of the material is to increase substantially stress intensity factors (SIFs) values compare to that of a single crack without corrosion. For a given cyclic stress range, SIF decreases with increasing rivet interference level. This is particularly true for shorter crack lengths. SIF values for the longer crack are not sensitive to the length of shorter crack on the opposite side of the rivet hole. The effects of corrosion pillowing cause SIF values on the <b>faying</b> <b>surface</b> to be larger than those on the opposing surface, and the crack front distorts from the straight front. Moreover, stresses on the <b>faying</b> <b>surface</b> may exceed the yield strength of the material...|$|E

Transient Liquid Phase Bonding (TLPB) is a joining {{process that}} uses liquid as medium for the {{establishment}} of an interface between two <b>faying</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In TLPB, as opposed to brazing process, the careful selection of the interlayer materials and the use of a prolonged heat treatment, allows for isothermal solidification and results in interfaces possessing potential service temperature higher than the joining temperature itself. Such a process is attractive for joining ceramics to metals and composites. In this presentation, the applicability of TLPB for various systems: Si 3 N 4 /FA- 129 iron aluminide alloy, Al 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3, Al-Al 2 O 3 /Al-Al 2 O 3, Al-Al 2 O 3 /Al-SiC and Al-Al 2 O 3 /Al.

Joining advanced materials, such as ceramics, intermetallics and either ceramic or metallic matrix composites is attracting a lot of attention for applications where conventional materials would not sustain the service conditions.

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSWing) is a {{solid state}} joining {{technique}} which reduces the occurrence of typical defects formed in fusion welds, especially of highly alloyed metals. Although the process is robust for aluminum alloys, occasional reductions in the strength of FSWs have been observed. Shortly after the NASA-MSFC implemented a variation of FSW called self-reacting (SR), low strength properties were observed. At that time, this reduction in strength was attributed to a line defect. At that time, the limited data suggested that the line defect {{was related to the}} accumulation of native oxides that form on the weld lands and <b>faying</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Through a series of improved cleaning methods, tool redesign, and process parameter modifications, the reduction in the strength of the SR-FSWs was eliminated. As more data has been collected, the occasional reduction in the strength of SR-FSW still occurs. These occasional reductions indicate a need to reexamine the underlying causes. This study builds off a series of self reacting (SR) -FSWs that were made in 3 different thickness panels of AA 2219 (0. 95, 1. 27 and 1. 56 cm) at 2 different weld pitches.
