Although ICs had been available since the 1960s, {{it was only in}} the early 1970s that they reached the performance necessary for high-speed applications. The Cray-1 used only four different IC types, an ECL dual 5-4 NOR gate (one 5-input, and one 4-input, each with differential output), another slower MECL 10K 5-4 NOR gate used for address fanout, a 16×4-bit high speed (6 ns) static RAM (SRAM) used <b>for</b> <b>registers</b> and a 1,024×1-bit 48 ns SRAM used for the main memory.

5000|$|Most Forth systems {{include an}} {{assembler}} that {{allows one to}} specify words using the processor's facilities at its lowest level. Mostly the assembler is tucked away in a separate namespace (wordlist) as relatively few users want to use it. Forth assemblers may use a reverse-polish syntax in which the parameters of an instruction precede the instruction, but designs vary widely and are specific to the Forth implementation. A typical reverse-polish assembler prepares the operands on the stack and have the mnemonic copy the whole instruction into memory as the last step. A Forth assembler is by nature a macro assembler, {{so that it is}} easy to define an alias <b>for</b> <b>registers</b> according to their role in the Forth system: e.g. [...] "datastackpointer" [...] for the register used as a stack pointer.|$|E
5000|$|The Registers were [...] "owned" [...] by the MCUs {{and each}} MCU had {{a maximum of}} 36 Registers. The MCU was {{responsible}} for looking after all of its Registers and deciding from the dialled information where the call {{was going to be}} routed. The local exchange numbering system would be available to the MCU via threadings in the cyclic store so the MCU would be able to read this information and in this way all exchanges could be configured as required. If a call was identified by the MCU as being own exchange, usually by the first digit, then the MCU would tell the Register to come back when the complete number had been dialled. If the first dialled digit was a zero then this would normally be routed straight to the Group Switching Centre. However, if the exchange had an Alternative Available Route say 0296 then the MCU would have to wait until enough routing digits had been received to make a routing decision. Again this AAR information was stored in the cyclic stores. Once the MCU had decided the routing, it sent a command to the Interrogator/Markers to set up the required path and also told the Register what dialled digits to forward on. Then the MCU would {{move on to the next}} task. Once the connection had been established, the Supervisory Processing Unit (SPU) took care of the path and all the call metering tasks. The MCUs had core memory to hold the dialled digits from all the Registers and also had other storage to manipulate call set-up information. There were three scan rates: 156ms for subscribers, 36ms <b>for</b> <b>Registers,</b> Outgoing Junctions and Routing Translations, and 12ms for Incoming Junctions. The last of these was obviously the quickest scan, to ensure that no incoming digits were lost from the incoming junctions. (A junction in BT terminology was not a junction in the ordinary sense of the word, but was the name given to a pair of wires connecting a call between a 'satellite' telephone exchange and the main exchange.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Alt-Schwedendorf (Gammalsvenskby, {{in modern}} Swedish, {{but in the}} old-fashioned local East Swedish dialect: Gammölsvänskbi; in Russian, {{formerly}} Staro-Svedskaya, and, in Ukrainian, Старошведське, Staroshveds'ke; also known as Verbivka (Ukrainian, Вербівка), which in German renderings are Staroschwedske and Werbiwka): originally, and overwhelmingly, Lutheran, it was founded by Swedes in 1782, and later supplemented by German settlers, mostly Lutherans, in the period 1802 to 1806. As the oldest and, then, sole village already established, it served as the short-term mustering place from which three other (German) colonies were settled according to religion and ethnicity. As such, for a time, its inhabitants included some German Roman Catholics who settled in to the north in the new village of Klosterdorf, or left the area entirely, for destinations such as the Taurien district of Crimea, further to the south. The majority of the influx, however, consisted of German Lutherans who were settled {{to the south of}} Alt-Schwedendorf in what were, at least, at the outset, the exclusively German Lutheran villages of Mühlhausendorf and Schlangendorf, for which, see below. After years of tension between the Lutheran Swedes and Lutheran Germans, the Swedes built their own parish church dedicated to St John the Baptist (consecrated 1886; it was later closed during Soviet times and used for various profane purposes, but is now refurbished and used as an Orthodox Christian church) in the village of Gammalsvenskby/Alt-Schwedendorf, while the German Lutherans of the two southern neighbouring villages built their own house of worship (Betthaus, literally German for prayer house) between the two German Lutheran villages of Mühlhausendorf and Schlangendorf, and dedicated it to St Peter and St Paul (consecrated 1888). As for Alt-Schwedendorf, in 1915, it, along with the three other original villages, was subsumed into modern Zmiivka (see German Schlangendorf, below). As Gammalsvenskby, it is, however, accorded historic status in the region for its association with one of the few settlements of Swedish-speaking colonists in what was once known as South Russia or New Russia, and now forms part of Ukraine (see article on Gammalsvenskby for more details of this aspect of the village's history and current role as an historic site). The church records of the local Lutheran population, whether German or Swedish, survive for part of the nineteenth century (1833-1885), in the archives of the St Petersburg Evangelical Lutheran Consistory, and have been microfilmed by the Genealogical Society of Utah, and partially indexed. For many years, the records for Alt-Schwedendorf were recorded in tandem with those of Josefstal (older German spelling, Josephsthal; its Ukrainian name is Samarivka/Самарівка), an upriver village in the former Ekaterinoslav colonies (which see below) over 250 km to the north whose Lutheran pastors visited Alt-Schwedendorf occasionally to perform marriages, leaving the baptisms and burials to be performed by laymen such as the church sexton or village schoolmaster. During that period, Alt-Schwedendorf was effectively a filial chapelry of Josefstal, meaning that many of the records relevant to its inhabitants have been indexed and appear under the mother parish's name rather than the daughter community to which these folk belonged. Confusing as this may be, successful research into this area can mean one encounters records and studies written not only in German, but in also Swedish, Russian, and English. To complicate matters further, when a large number of the ethnic Swedes of the area were allowed to leave the Soviet Union for Sweden, they were provided with a copy of their original parish registers (in German Kirchenbücher, literally church books, or Matrikeln, <b>for</b> <b>registers)</b> dating back to the foundation of the Swedish colony in 1782. These registers include records covering the ethnic German Lutheran population particularly in cases of intermarriage, and cover the whole period of Swedish habitation up to the year of partial departure, i.e. 1929.|$|E
