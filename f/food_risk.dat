40|$|<b>Risks</b> {{related to}} <b>food</b> {{production}} and consumption are not a recent phenomenon. Through agricultural practices, the transport of agricultural and food products, the processing of food, its storage, and finally the consumption of <b>food,</b> <b>risks</b> have been externalized, mediated, contested and ingested. But agrofood systems have also been paralleled by routinized practices and institutions that attempt to reduce risks and sustain trust among the many actors involved in these food regimes. However, both the (definition of) <b>food</b> <b>risks</b> and the institutions and discourses used to dispel anxiety and build trust are far from stable throughout time. In the contemporary modern world-order, <b>food</b> <b>risks</b> and the practices and institutions dealing with these risks reflect the significant transformations in the agrofood system, {{the changing nature of}} the <b>risks</b> involved in <b>food</b> {{production and consumption}}, and the modifications in scientific risk assessment and risk management.

40|$|To {{find out}} the {{perception}} of <b>food</b> <b>risks</b> among women, media analysis and interviews with Estonian and Russian women were made. Media analysis overviewed the amount and approach of articles about <b>food</b> <b>risks</b> in Postimees (Estonian newspaper) and Molodjozh Estonii (Estonian Russian language newspaper) during one year (November 2005 - November 2006). I also overviewed magazines for women (two Estonian and two Russian magazines that are published in Estonia). The interviews were made with five Estonian young women who have little children and five Russian young mothers. I supposed that young mothers are more sensitive {{in the perception of}} <b>food</b> <b>risks.</b> <b>Food</b> <b>risks</b> and their perception are dependent on people personal experiences, their cultural environment, governmental activities and restrictions and such issues like media. Media analysis has showed that during one year only few articles in different media channels have entirely reflected subjects about <b>food</b> <b>risks.</b> In Russian newspaper Molodjozh Estonii was published five times less information about <b>food</b> <b>risks</b> than in Estonian Postimees. All together in four magazines only nine articles were written about <b>food</b> <b>risks.</b> Four of them were published in Russian language magazine Lada. The analysis of the interviews shows that knowledge of <b>food</b> <b>risks</b> among young women who have little children is not very high. Though everyone stated that they are trying to eat healthy food, the perception of <b>food</b> <b>risks</b> is more superficial. The most important <b>food</b> <b>risks</b> that were named - overweight, allergy, skin problems. Allergy also tends to influence very strongly the choice of food in the shop. Few respondents have stated that either they or their children have allergy on some products. The fact is that everyone has stated that with their child’s birth and with pregnancy they have changed their usual diet to healthier one. Comparing to respondents’ parents some food habits occur also now in their own family, but some habits have been changed. That means that family does not have very strong influence on personal diet, though Russian interviewees think that firstly family influences the diet strategy of children. Estonian respondents think that the whole social environment influences child’s choices (advertisement, media, school, kindergarten). Though people and media are not paying enough attention to <b>food</b> <b>risks</b> and how they can influence on us, qualitative characteristics of Estonians’ health are quiet sad. None of the respondents found it significant the threats of cardiovascular disease. The last is the first reason of people’s death in Estonia. There were no essential differences between young Estonian and Russian women, which might be explained that Russian women have lived in Estonia for quiet long time and Estonian culture is sometimes closer to them than traditional Russian culture. But Russian and Estonian women said that they prefer cooking at home and love Russian cuisine. Estonia is a multi-cultural country and Russian cuisine example shows that some traditions are mixed here. Women think that magazines and newspapers are writing about diets and give receipts (food subjects in media). They get mostly information about diets in the internet and women’s magazines. They are looking for the concrete information if they know concretely what they need to find out. But also everyone thinks that it is much better to follow your intuition and feelings while choosing the diet...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Intervening {{after several}} years flustered by {{numerous}} food crisis (ESB, dioxins, listeria) and an intense debate on OGM, it reveals {{at the same time}} a crumbling of the traditional food models across the development of the consumption of easy products to be used anywhere (such as pizzas, soda or juice of fruit) and a strong request on behalf of the consumers in information, in control by authorities and in scientific research in the domains of food security and nutrition. The general perception of <b>food</b> <b>risks</b> is accompanied by a feeling of loss of the traditional food landmarks. The mutation of food practices, notably the cohabitation in the population of often different food habits and sometimes compared, contributes to the questionings of each and explains the strong reactivity of the consumers and public opinion in numerous food crises. Particularly, very strong difference of consumption and food behaviors between generations can only provoke doubts among the oldest on the permanence of a traditional and reassuring food model. In the inquiry, the idea most often linked to the general perception of <b>food</b> <b>risks</b> is the feeling of deterioration of the quality of the food products for last ten years. This overview of <b>food</b> <b>risks</b> explains that, beyond punctual <b>food</b> crisis, nutritional <b>risks</b> are more named spontaneously among «major risks linked to feeding». So, in their perception of <b>food</b> <b>risks,</b> the consumers grant a very big place at nutritional risks and particularly at obesity and at diseases of society (cardiovascular diseases, diabetes). Doubts of the consumers in <b>food</b> security (<b>risks</b> of physicochemical or microbiological pollution) appear more as the symptoms of a deep confusion of reports in feeding, on the occasion of which the perception of nutritional and health risks is intimately linked...|$|R
5000|$|The bioelectric {{recognition}} assay (BERA) {{is a novel}} {{method for}} determination of various chemical and biological molecules by measuring changes in the membrane potential of cells immobilized in a gel matrix. Apart from the increased stability of the electrode-cell interface, immobilization preserves the viability and physiological functions of the cells. BERA is used primarily in biosensor applications in order to assay analytes that can interact with the immobilized cells by changing the cell membrane potential. In this way, when a positive sample {{is added to the}} sensor, a characteristic, [...] "signature-like" [...] change in electrical potential occurs. BERA is the core technology behind the recently launched pan-European FOODSCAN project, about pesticide and <b>food</b> <b>risk</b> assessment in Europe.

The aim of this study is to model the underlying psychological factors influencing consumer evaluations of <b>food</b> <b>risk</b> management quality using structural equation modeling techniques (SEM), and to examine the extent to which the influence of these factors is country-specific (comparing respondents from Denmark, Germany, Greece, Slovenia, and the United Kingdom). A survey was developed to model the factors that drive consumer evaluations of <b>food</b> <b>risk</b> management practices and their relative importance (n = 2, 533 total respondents). The measurement scales included in the structural model were configurally and metrically invariant across countries. Results show that some factors appear to drive perceptions of effective <b>food</b> <b>risk</b> management in all the countries studied, such as proactive consumer protection, which was positively related to consumers' evaluation of <b>food</b> <b>risk</b> management quality, while opaque and reactive risk management was negatively related to perceived <b>food</b> <b>risk</b> management quality. Other factors appeared to apply only in certain countries. For example, skepticism in risk assessment and communication practices was negatively related to <b>food</b> <b>risk</b> management quality, particularly so in the UK. Expertise of <b>food</b> <b>risk</b> managers appeared to be a key factor in consumers' evaluation of <b>food</b> <b>risk</b> management quality in some countries.

Method: This study utilized two internet-based questionnaires which were adapted from a published paper (De Boer, McCarthy, Brennan, Kelly, 2 ̆ 6 Ritson, 2005) for KFDA imported food inspectors and college students. Rating, ranking, and demographic questions were included in the questionnaires. Results: The results indicated that the KFDA inspectors and the college students perceived that the public‘s level of understanding of imported <b>food</b> <b>risk</b> issues is somewhat low. The majority of the KFDA inspectors and the college students believed that public awareness of imported <b>food</b> <b>risk</b> issues is driven by the media and the media contributes the most to improving understanding of imported <b>food</b> <b>risk</b> issues. However, the KFDA insptors and the college students believed that media coverage of imported <b>food</b> <b>risk</b> issues is often misleading in order to maximize their impact. The KFDA inspectors considered chemicals, mad cow disease and microbiological contamination as the public‘s three most important concerns while the college students believed the public is most concerned about chemicals, mad cow disease, and mislabeling. According to the views of the KFDA inspector, sensational reporting of imported food risks has the greatest detrimental effect on the public‘s ability to understand imported <b>food</b> <b>risk</b> issues. The college students believed lack of knowledge about imported food has the greatest influence {{on the extent to which}} the public fails to understand. Government agencies and the media were considered the most responsible and reliable sources of imported <b>food</b> <b>risk</b> communication by the college students and the KFDA inspectors. Conclusions: Despite limitations, this study is the first to explore the views of KFDA inspectors and college students on public perception of impored <b>food</b> <b>risk</b> issues in South Korea.

40|$|Crises in <b>food</b> <b>risk</b> {{management}} {{have often}} been attributed to disconnection between the stakeholders involved, as when consumers do not believe risk communications or dispute risk managers' priorities.

Focus groups were conducted in five European countries chosen for their (hypothesised) cultural differences in attitudes towards risk: Denmark, Germany, Greece, Slovenia and the UK. Content analysis was carried out on the resulting texts and (sub) categories were identified within the analysis framework to facilitate the capture of emerging themes. Five key themes were identified as common to the perceptions of both consumers and experts, although these are not represented in the same way by both groups.

Although some similarities emerged between the groups, differences were also identified. For example, experts appeared to be highly negative about media influences, whereas consumers appeared more indifferent about media influences and motives.

40|$|Background: In {{the wake}} of the ` bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE) crisis' there was renewed interest in how those responsible for public health could take account of public views, both to ` democratize' policy making and to increase the likelihood of information about health risks resonating with public concerns. This study explored how members of the public in four European countries (Finland, Germany, Italy and the UK) understood <b>food</b> <b>risks</b> in general, and risks arising from BSE in particular. The aims were to identify the sources of knowledge used and trusted by the public and to explore how public views could be accessed for public health information policy. Methods: Thirty- six focus group interviews were held using a common protocol across the four countries, including people from four lifecycle stages. Results: The study demonstrated the utility of using focus groups as a relatively efficient method for accessing public views, and the feasibility of cross- national qualitative research on public views. We found that public views of <b>food</b> <b>risks</b> are neither irrational nor naive, but that they do need to be interpreted in the context of everyday food purchasing decisions, in which particular <b>food</b> <b>risks</b> are unlikely to have the same salience as they do for experts.
