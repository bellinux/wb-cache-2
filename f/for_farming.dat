5|$|After the Great Depression the use {{of horses}} <b>for</b> <b>farming</b> {{decreased}} and tractors took their place, and the Bona Allen Company steadily downsized until the tannery was eventually sold to the Tandy Corporation in 1968.

5|$|Battersea, {{listed as}} Patricesy (St Peter's Water) in the Domesday Book and first {{mentioned}} in records of 693 AD, {{on the south}} {{bank of the river}} opposite Chelsea, was by contrast low and marshy land, prone to flooding.

5|$|Because of {{its close}} {{proximity}} to the sea, Jaywick had never been a practical place <b>for</b> <b>farming</b> due to the risk from floods; and the land remained unused. A sea wall was built in 1880 to protect against flooding. Ordnance Survey mapping around 1897 shows Jaywick as a few farmhouses near what is now Crossways on the Tudor estate.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of its}} history, {{agriculture}} {{has been}} organic, without synthetic fertilisers or pesticides, and without GMOs. With the advent of chemical agriculture, Rudolf Steiner called <b>for</b> <b>farming</b> without synthetic pesticides, and his Agriculture Course of 1924 {{laid the foundation for}} biodynamic agriculture. Lord Northbourne developed these ideas and presented his manifesto of organic farming in 1940. This became a worldwide movement, and organic farming is now practiced in most countries.|$|E

In 1911 the castle was placed into the guardianship of the Commissioners of Works and Public Buildings, later passing into the control of the government heritage agency English Heritage. Archaeological surveys of the site were carried out in 1987, 1988, 1992 and 2001.|$|E
5|$|HBC {{control of}} Rupert's Land ended in 1868; when Manitoba became a {{province}} in 1870, all land became {{the property of}} the federal government, with homesteads granted to settlers <b>for</b> <b>farming.</b> Transcontinental railways were constructed to simplify trade. Manitoba's economy depended mainly on farming, which persisted until drought and the Great Depression led to further diversification.|$|E

Although the fertile soil and good drainage of the Chilterns provides ideal conditions <b>for</b> <b>farming,</b> the steep hills historically made travelling difficult. Few sizeable settlements developed in Buckinghamshire, and what roads existed were of poor quality.|$|E

5|$|The bay's shore, {{especially}} {{near the}} Colorado River delta, provides a habitat {{for a wide}} variety of wildlife. The wildlife serves as a basis for the birding and fishing tourism, and is an essential component of the production of seafood, specifically shrimp and blue crab, which are the specialties of the area. The fertile land near the bay is ideal <b>for</b> <b>farming,</b> especially for the propagation of rice.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} humans {{must have}} had and passed on knowledge about plants and animals to increase their chances of survival. This may have included knowledge of human and animal anatomy and aspects of animal behavior (such as migration patterns). However, the first major turning point in biological knowledge came with the Neolithic Revolution about 10,000 years ago. Humans first domesticated plants <b>for</b> <b>farming,</b> then livestock animals to accompany the resulting sedentary societies.|$|E

5|$|The precise {{origin of}} the Aylesbury duck is unclear. Before the 18thcentury, duck breeds were rarely {{recorded}} in England, and the common duck, bred <b>for</b> <b>farming,</b> was a domesticated form of the wild mallard. The common duck varied in colour, and as in the wild, white ducks would occasionally occur. White ducks were particularly prized, as their feathers were popular as a filler for quilts.|$|E

5|$|The region's {{precipitation}} pattern is bimodal, meaning agriculture is sustained through snowfall during winter and autumn and rainfall during spring and summer. The climate is semi-arid. Water <b>for</b> <b>farming</b> and consumption {{was provided by}} summer rains, winter snowfall, and seeps and springs in and near the Mesa Verde villages. At , the middle mesa areas were typically ten degrees Fahrenheit (5.5°C) cooler than the mesa top, which reduced {{the amount of water}} needed <b>for</b> <b>farming.</b> The cliff dwellings were built to take advantage of solar energy. The angle of the sun in winter warmed the masonry of the cliff dwellings, warm breezes blew from the valley, and the air was ten to twenty degrees warmer in the canyon alcoves than {{on the top of the}} mesa. In the summer, with the sun high overhead, much of the village was protected from direct sunlight in the high cliff dwellings.|$|E
5|$|Whitemore is a {{small rural}} town in Northern Tasmania, in the Meander Valley Council area. The town's land and {{surrounding}} rural area was first granted to Richard Dry in the 1830s then sold <b>for</b> <b>farming</b> to William Hingston in 1854. Hingston constructed a Wesleyan Chapel, near which a few later buildings were added. Over time the town has had a blacksmith, post office, library, shops and petrol station; none of these remain in the 21st Century.|$|E
5|$|Advice on more {{productive}} techniques <b>for</b> <b>farming</b> {{began to appear}} in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others. The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used. The Dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the British agriculturist Charles Townshend in the 18th century. The system (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates.|$|E
