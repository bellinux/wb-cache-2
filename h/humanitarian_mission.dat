5|$|With two Landing Ship Docks, Boxer was {{dispatched}} to Hispaniola on 29 August 1964 on a <b>humanitarian</b> <b>mission</b> to aid Haiti and the Dominican Republic whose infrastructure had {{been damaged by}} Hurricane Cleo. The ships provided medical aid and helped to evacuate civilians displaced by the storm. On 27 April 1965 Boxer returned to the Dominican Republic with Helicopter Squadron 264 and a complement of Marines. They evacuated about 1,000 US nationals from {{the country in the}} wake of a revolution in the country. It was a part of Operation Powerpack which would eventually see the US occupation of that country. Later in 1965, she was used as a transport vessel for the Vietnam War. The carrier transported 200 helicopters of the US Army's 1st Cavalry Division to South Vietnam. She made a second trip to Vietnam in early 1966 when she transported Marine Corps aircraft to South Vietnam. However, she did not participate in combat operations during that war.|$|E

25|$|The second combat jump {{was made}} on Wednesday, March 21, 1951, at Munsan-ni, South Korea codenamed Operation Tomahawk. The mission was to get behind Chinese forces and block their {{movement}} north. The 60th Indian Parachute Field Ambulance provided the medical cover for the operations, dropping an ADS and a surgical team totalling 7 officers and 5 other ranks, treating over 400 battle casualties apart from the civilian casualties that formed the core of their objective as the unit was on a <b>humanitarian</b> <b>mission.</b> The unit was to become the longest-serving military unit in any UN operation till date, serving from October 1950 till May 1953, {{a total of three}} and a half years, returning home to a heroes' welcome.|$|E

25|$|During the Somali Civil War, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{committed}} Canada to UNOSOM I after United Nations Security Council Resolution 751. UNOSOM I was {{the first}} part of the UN's response effort to provide security and humanitarian relief in Somalia, while monitoring UN-brokered ceasefires. Canadian forces, under the name Operation Deliverance, participated in the American-led Operation Restore Hope. In May 1993 the operation came under UN command and was renamed UNOSOM II. By its end, the mission had turned into a political disaster for the Canadian Forces. During the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>mission</b> Canadian soldiers tortured a Somali teenager to death, leading to the Somalia Affair. Following an inquiry, the elite Canadian Airborne Regiment was disbanded and the reputation of the Canadian Forces suffered within Canada.|$|E
25|$|Three German troopers {{were wounded}} in a vehicle-born suicide attack the {{following}} day. A further week-long series of engagements resulted in eight more German WIAs, {{among them the}} first female German soldier to be wounded in action. KSK operatives launched another successful raid in early October and captured 15 Taliban during a surprise attack. Three civilians were killed and 17 wounded during a Taliban attack on October 3. Six insurgents were detained by ISAF and ANSF forces on October 10 and more than 50 surrendered.

25|$|On 11 July 2006, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) {{took control}} of the Somali capital Mogadishu, and by the {{beginning}} of December had firm control of most of the south of Somalia. In November 2006, a United States Marine detachment was in the town of Garissa in Kenya's North Eastern Province, adjoining Somalia. Officially, the Marines were an engineering detachment conducting a <b>humanitarian</b> <b>mission</b> of drilling bore holes in conjunction with the Kenya military to support flood relief. However, locals speculated that the Marines were performing a reconnaissance mission close to the Somali border. On 26 November 2006, the U.S. Embassy in Kenya issued a travel alert to U.S. citizens regarding travel to Kenya or Ethiopia after letters allegedly written by the Somalian leader of the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), Sheik Hassan Dahir Aweys, encouraged suicide attacks on U.S. citizens in those two countries.|$|E

25|$|In the {{remaining}} provinces, killings continued throughout May and June, although they became increasingly low-key and sporadic; most Tutsi were already dead, and {{the interim government}} wished {{to rein in the}} growing anarchy and engage the population in fighting the RPF. On 23 June, around 2,500 soldiers entered southwestern Rwanda as part of the French-led United Nations Operation Turquoise. This was intended as a <b>humanitarian</b> <b>mission,</b> but the soldiers were not able to save significant numbers of lives. The genocidal authorities were overtly welcoming of the French, displaying the French flag on their own vehicles, but slaughtering Tutsi who came out of hiding seeking protection. In July, the RPF completed their conquest of the country, {{with the exception of the}} zone occupied by Operation Turquoise. The RPF took Kigali on 4 July, and Gisenyi and the rest of the northwest on 18 July. The genocide was over, but as had occurred in Kibungo, the Hutu population fled en masse across the border, this time into Zaire, with Bagosora and the other leaders accompanying them.|$|E

Taft tended towards Washington's approach. According to Coletta, Taft let the African-American [...] "be 'kept in his place'...

500|$|Halvorsen did {{not want}} to merely re-enact the candy drop to {{countries}} no longer plagued by war. In later years he advocated using candy drops to lift spirits and promote goodwill in other nations. In 1994 he persuaded the air force to let him drop hundreds of candy bars over Bosnia-Herzegovina as part of Operation Provide Promise. Another, larger drop was planned and executed by Halvorsen over Kosovo in 1999. Additional candy drops have been enacted in Japan, Guam, Albania, and across the United States. In 2003 and 2004, he advocated a similar series of candy drops over Baghdad as a <b>humanitarian</b> <b>mission</b> to be a [...] "ray of hope, a symbol that somebody in America cares." [...] Since that time, the United States military has emulated some of his actions in Iraq by dropping toys, teddy bears, and soccer balls to Iraqi children.|$|E

500|$|After {{stopping}} at Manila in the Philippines, the fleet set course for Yokohama, Japan. They encountered a typhoon {{on the way}} on 12 October, but no ships were lost; the fleet was only delayed 24 hours. After three Japanese men-of-war and six merchantmen escorted the Americans in, festivities began. The celebrations culminated in the Uraga, where Commodore Matthew C. Perry had anchored {{a little more than}} 50 years prior. The ships then departed on 25 October. After three weeks of exercises in the Philippines' Subic Bay, the ships sailed south on 1 December for Singapore; they did not stop there, however, passing outside the city on 6 December. Continuing on, they stopped at Colombo for coal from 12–20 December before sailing on for the Suez Canal. It took three days for all 16 battleships to traverse the canal, even though it was closed to all other traffic. They then headed for a coaling stop at Port Said, Egypt, after which the fleet split up into individual divisions to call on different ports in the Mediterranean. The First Division, of which Connecticut was a part, originally planned to visit Italy before moving on to Villefranche, but Connecticut and [...] were quickly dispatched to southern Italy on a <b>humanitarian</b> <b>mission</b> when news of an earthquake reached the fleet.
