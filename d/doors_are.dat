5|$|During construction, {{the weight}} had {{increased}} from 149 to 170 tonnes; to reduce this to 158 tonnes, {{the original idea}} of step-free access was discontinued. Instead, a wheelchair lift was installed, but it proved not to work. The area around the <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> step-free from the platform, but within the trains steps {{must be taken to}} reach the seating area. The Norwegian Federation of Organisations of Disabled People have criticized Flytoget for ordering identical additional cars that will not ease access for the disabled.|$|E
5|$|Huston {{designed}} the large bronze {{doors at the}} capitol's main entrance. They were modeled by sculptor Otto Jahnsen and were both cast in one piece using the lost wax method of casting by the Henry Bonnard Bronze Company. The <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> decorated with scenes {{from the history of}} Pennsylvania, such as the arrival of William Penn and his peace treaty with the Lenape. Busts of people who were important {{in the construction of the}} capitol, like Governor Pennypacker, Boies Penrose, and Matthew Quay, decorate the edges of the doors. The bust of Huston hides the doors' keyhole.|$|E

50|$|The {{fuel tank}} access <b>door</b> <b>was</b> {{installed}} {{on the right side}} for all versions sold internationally, however, for the LHD models, and the sliding <b>door</b> <b>was</b> on the right side, care needed to be taken to avoid opening the sliding <b>door</b> when fuel <b>was</b> being added to the fuel tank. An interlock prevented the sliding door from opening too far when the fuel filler <b>door</b> <b>was</b> open.|$|R

5|$|The 767 {{interior}} introduced larger overhead bins {{and more}} lavatories per passenger than previous aircraft. The bins are wider to accommodate garment bags without folding, and strengthened for heavier carry-on items. A single, large galley is installed near the aft doors, allowing for more efficient meal service and simpler ground resupply. Passenger and service <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> an overhead plug type, which retract upwards, and commonly used doors can {{be equipped with}} an electric-assist system.|$|E
5|$|The Ballroom, {{the last}} of the palace's three largest rooms, (illustrated below) was {{designed}} by Robillon in 1760. To create this oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms. The ormolu Rococo ornament takes the form of heavy gilding to the walls and ceiling, of such richness that it has been compared with that of François de Cuvilliés' Amalienburg at Schloss Nymphenburg. The walls and <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> mirrored and the painted and gilded, coffered ceiling is supported by golden caryatids.|$|E
5|$|The {{carriage}} house, {{today the}} Ellwood House Museum's Education and Visitors Center, {{was built by}} Perry Ellwood as a multi-car garage. It had a grease pit for automobile repair work. On the second floor was an apartment for the Ellwood family chauffeur. The building originally had garage doors on both sides so cars could drive in one side {{and out the other}} side of the structure. The original <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> on display inside the Ellwood House Visitors Center.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's up?" [...] asked {{somebody}} outside, {{and then}} the <b>door</b> <b>was</b> tried. Soon a key was inserted in the lock, the <b>door</b> <b>was</b> opened, and a chambermaid showed herself.|$|R
50|$|On the dau wall, {{next to the}} llotgeta there's {{a wooden}} door to the patio, this <b>door</b> <b>is</b> {{normally}} open to allow casual spectators some indirect vision {{of the game and}} it becomes another place where the players aim the ball, in order to tamper the rival's back shot. Also, when the <b>door</b> <b>is</b> closed, the rebounds on the wooden <b>door</b> <b>are</b> unpredictable.|$|R
5000|$|The front <b>door</b> <b>is</b> not original. It was {{originally}} {{topped by a}} classic fanlight and sidelights. [...] The small portico now above the <b>door</b> in front <b>was</b> added when the original <b>door</b> <b>was</b> sold during the 1930s, according to town legend.|$|R
5|$|The entire metro {{system and}} the trains are run by a fully {{automated}} computer system, located at the Control and Maintenance Center south of Vestamager Station. The automatic train control (ATC) consists of three subsystems: automatic train protection (ATP), automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train supervisory (ATS). The ATP is responsible for keeping the trains' speed, ensuring that <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> closed before departure and switches are correctly set. The system uses fixed block signaling, except around stations, where moving block signaling is used.|$|E
5|$|While these {{characteristics}} never occur all {{together in the}} same building, and none are unique to Sicilian Baroque, it is the coupling together which gives the Sicilian Baroque its distinctive air. Other Baroque characteristics, such as broken pediments over windows, the extravagant use of statuary, and curved topped windows and <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> all emblematic of Baroque architecture, but can all be found on Baroque building all over Europe.|$|E
5|$|While {{trying to}} close the doors, the player must avoid certain hazards. Mario will lose a life if he touches an enemy, runs out of time, runs {{off the edge of}} the floor he is on, or if all the <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> open. Enemies in the game are mostly regular Mario series creatures, such as Goombas, Koopas, Boos and their variations. The {{opponent}} on the last stage of each hotel is one of the Koopalings, who each use different methods to attack Mario.|$|E

5|$|Dino Crisis {{features}} survival horror gameplay that is {{very similar}} to Capcom's early Resident Evil titles. Regina can walk, run, turn, backpedal, push and climb objects, and perform a 180-degree turn. A map is available which will show Regina's location, destination, save points, and locked doors. Save points are rooms which will prompt the player to save upon exiting them. Some <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> locked by a D.D.K. (digital disk key) device. To open these doors, the player will need both a code disc and input disc which can then be used to decipher a code and unlock the door. There are also force fields of red beams throughout the complex which can be activated to block access to intruders.|$|E
5|$|Other rooms {{include the}} casino, where creatures gamble for either {{pleasure}} {{or to be}} exploited for gold, the Workshop, where traps and <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> produced, the torture chamber, where creatures are tortured. Traps include the Sentry trap, which shoots nearby enemy creatures, the Fear trap, which scares enemies away, and the Alarm trap, which alerts its owner if it detect enemy creatures nearby. Doors block enemies while still allowing its owner's creatures passage. They come in various forms, such as Wooden, Braced, Secret, and Magic. Secret doors imitate walls, and Magic doors defend themselves by shooting enemy creatures. Bridges connect areas and facilitate transport over water and lava tiles, the latter harming most creatures and burning Wooden Bridges. Stone Bridges are immune.|$|E
5|$|The 757-200SF, a {{conversion}} of passenger 757-200s for cargo use, entered service with DHL Aviation in 2001. Modifications by Boeing Wichita in Kansas included {{the removal of}} passenger amenities, main deck structural reinforcement, and the installation of a 757-200PF forward fuselage section with a port-side cargo door. The forward two entry <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> retained, resulting in a main deck cargo capacity of 14 pallets, which is one less than the 757-200PF. Environmental controls can be fitted for animal cargo, and rear exits and window pairs are retained on some aircraft. Besides Boeing, Israel Aerospace Industries, Precision Conversions, and ST Aerospace Services have also handled 757-200SF conversions. In September 2006, FedEx Express announced a US$2.6billion plan to acquire over 80 converted 757 freighters to replace its 727 fleet.|$|E
50|$|Chest-height {{platform}} edge <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> introduced {{on the two}} Yamanote Line platforms from 26 June 2010, {{the first}} time that such <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> installed on a JR line other than the Shinkansen.|$|R

50|$|The {{long-haul}} layout {{featured a}} four seats per row, with central aisle and forward door. Driver had a separate {{door to the}} driving compartment. The capacity of long-haul NDO buses was 42 passengers. The short-haul layout featured wider aisle with seats arranged along the bus walls facing aisle. The folding <b>door</b> <b>was</b> located {{in the center of}} the bus body. The short-haul layout had the 65 passengers capacity, with 27 seats. Also, a short-hail version with the two <b>doors</b> <b>was</b> made. The front <b>door</b> <b>was</b> still operated from the driver`s compartment, while the rear <b>door</b> <b>was</b> operated by the conductor.|$|R
5|$|The {{interior}} of the hall is opulently, but {{by the standards of}} the day, simply decorated and furnished. Ornament is used with such restraint that it was possible to decorate both private and state rooms in the same style, without oppressing the former. The principal entrance is through the Marble Hall, which is in fact made of pink Derbyshire alabaster; this leads to the piano nobile, or the first floor, and state rooms. The most impressive of these rooms is the Saloon, which has walls lined with red velvet. Each of the major state rooms is symmetrical in its layout and design; in some rooms, false <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> necessary to fully achieve this balanced effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} original woodwork, sills, door frames, {{and interior}} <b>doors,</b> <b>are</b> all solid oak. The interior walls are 12inches thick and, either painted or covered with paneling. An open, double staircase leads {{from the first}} floor to {{the second and third}} floors and the center of the building houses an elevator which moves from the basement to the third floor. The interior floors are all white pine wood, though some of the floors have now been carpeted. First floor ceilings are 15feet high, with doors at a height of 12feet. The second floor features the courtrooms, which, through the 1980s remodel, had the ceilings lowered to 10feet. The interior renovation was completed at a cost of US$1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|The trams are bidirectional, with a driver's cab at each end. These cabs {{are built}} so the {{motorman}} can also sell tickets. The cab's have {{a door to}} close them off, so the riders cannot access rear cab. There are four doors on both sides; the front door is single while the three back <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> double. In addition to the front door, there is one door in each section. To operate the doors on the left side, the motorman must engage a security switch. It is also possible to open each individual door {{on the right side}} from the driver's cab. Half the length is low-floor, with an entry height at , including three of the four doors. There are 88 seats, of which 64 are on the high-floor section, giving a total capacity of 212 riders.|$|E
5000|$|Verbs {{indicating}} a passive action. For example, one might say, « La porte s'ouvre », which literally means, [...] "The <b>door</b> <b>is</b> opening itself," [...] but really means, [...] "The <b>door</b> <b>is</b> opening." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was past}} eleven o'clock, and the <b>door</b> <b>was</b> closed. It opened softly on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle. They entered, without noise; and the <b>door</b> <b>was</b> closed behind them.|$|R
50|$|For the {{purposes}} of evacuation, school buses are equipped {{with a minimum of}} at least one emergency exit in addition to the main entry door. The rear-mounted emergency exit <b>door</b> <b>is</b> a design feature retained from when school buses were horse-drawn wagons and the entrance <b>door</b> <b>was</b> rear-mounted to avoid frightening the horses; in rear-engine school buses, the <b>door</b> <b>is</b> replaced by an exit window supplemented by a side-mounted exit door.|$|R
5|$|While at {{the funeral}} for Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez) and Libby, a boat comes into view out at sea. Jack, Sayid, and Sawyer swim out to it and climb onto the boat. They hear music coming from inside it. Shots are fired from inside the boat through the boat hatch entrance. After {{breaking}} the hatch open, they find a drunken Desmond piloting the boat. The next day, after Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) prevents Locke from destroying the computer that controls the timer, Locke enlists Desmond's help in letting the timer run down to zero. Desmond hotwires the blast doors shut, locking Eko outside the computer room and Desmond and Locke inside of it. Eko, distraught, seeks Charlie Pace's (Dominic Monaghan) help. The two attempt to use dynamite to blow the blast door open, but the blast <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> unscathed, while they are both injured.|$|E
5|$|Utilising the Game Boy Horror, {{players can}} access {{a map of}} the mansion, seeing which rooms they have visited, what <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> open, and which remain locked. When Luigi finds a key during his explorations, the Game Boy Horror {{automatically}} indicates which door it unlocks. In addition to a map function, the device also keeps track of any treasure that Luigi has found - rooms will usually have treasure hidden within, which can be either coins, gems, gold bars and so forth, hidden within items and even in a chest that appears when the ghosts are cleared out, which Luigi can draw out and then suck up with the Poltergust; if a ghost harms Luigi, he will drop a small portion of collected treasure that he will need to recover before it disappears. After Luigi encounters a group of Boos hiding in the mansion, the device can be used to find each one hiding in a room, through a beeper sound and a flashing yellow light on the device, which turns red when Luigi is close to one; Boos can only be located in rooms that have become lit after their ghosts have been cleared out. Boos are trickier to deal with, as they can plant decoys and traps within objects they can hide in that can fool the Horror, and will escape into other rooms if they can, forcing the player to chase after them.|$|E
25|$|Australian <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> a pair {{of plywood}} {{swinging}} doors often found in Australian public houses. These <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> generally red or brown in color and bear a resemblance to the more formal doors found in other British Colonies' public houses.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Door</b> {{switches}} <b>are</b> simple on/off mechanisms {{connected to}} the interior light (dome light), and may also be connected to a warning light, speaker or other device, to inform the driver when the <b>door</b> <b>is</b> not closed. The <b>door</b> light <b>is</b> standard equipment on all cars. In American cars from the 1950s-1990s, they had buzzers or [...] "door dingers" [...] that sounded, along with the check light, whenever any <b>door</b> <b>is</b> open.|$|R
5000|$|Yichud is {{alleviated}} {{when the}} <b>door</b> <b>is</b> open. This principle {{is known as}} pesach pasuach lireshus harabim (lit. an open doorway to the public domain). The Shulchan Aruch rules: [...] "If the <b>door</b> <b>is</b> {{open to the public}} domain, there is no concern of yichud." [...] This ruling has been interpreted and enlarged in various ways: 1. the <b>door</b> <b>is</b> actually open 2. when the <b>door</b> <b>is</b> closed but unlocked 3. then <b>door</b> <b>is</b> locked, but somebody with a key is liable to come in at any time 4. the <b>door</b> <b>is</b> locked, but there is a reasonable possibility that people may knock on the door and expect to be answered (according to Moshe Feinstein). A woman being secluded with another man is also justified when people outside can see through the window what is going on inside the house. In case of a close, long-standing friendship between the man and the woman, however, a more stringent behavior is expected. The leniency usually does not apply late at night, as {{there is little or no}} chance that people would come in unexpectedly then.|$|R
