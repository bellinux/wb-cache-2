The <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> undergoes elastic deformation due to axial loading, resulting in the formation of a uniform fluid wedge between the orbiting and fixed <b>thrust</b> <b>plates.</b> This wedge region has very high induced oil film pressure, which explains the remarkably good lubrication characteristics of the thrust slide-bearing. Furthermore, the high oil film pressure induces further local elastic deformation of the <b>thrust</b> <b>plate,</b> forming an EHL oil pocket with the <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> and a further increase in the oil film pressure between the sliding surfaces due to this oil envelopment. The formation of the EHL pocket was confirmed using FEM analysis and lubrication tests on the elastic deformation of the <b>thrust</b> <b>plate.</b> Subsequently, the additional increase in oil film pressure, due to the EHL pocket effect, was examined in computer simulations applying the average Reynolds equation for the boundary of elastic deformation of the <b>thrust</b> <b>plate.</b> In these studies, a 6. 7 % increase in oil film pressure was ascertained for a small cooling capacity scroll compressor driven at 3600 rpm with 0. 1 kW motor.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} effect of the {{thickness}} and inner form of the <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> in a scroll compressor upon the lubrication features. A simplified model of a annular thrust slide-bearing with thinner <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> submerged in a refrigerant oil VG- 56 was operated under pressure using R- 22 as the pressurizing gas, where the pressure difference was adjusted from 0 to 1. 0 MPa. The friction force and coefficient of friction were measured over a wide range of orbiting speeds. The wedge angle due to elastic deformation is naturally increased with decreasing <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> thickness, resulting in a clear improvement in lubrication characteristics of the thrust slide-bearing. Subsequently, similar lubrication tests were conducted for the <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> model with a realistic inner form, one as complicated as that in actual scroll compressors, while maintaining the thickness of the <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> as in the previous test. No significant change in lubrication features relative to those from the simplified annular model were identified, confirming the validity of using simplified annular model tests to assess the basic lubrication characteristics of the thrust slide-bearing in scroll compressors...|$|R

40|$|Previous studies [Refs. 1, 2] {{revealed}} {{the formation of}} a uniform oil wedge at the periphery of the <b>thrust</b> <b>plate,</b> caused by the elastic deformation of the orbiting <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> due to the pressure difference across the orbiting <b>thrust</b> <b>plate,</b> is a significant factor in the high lubrication performance in thrust slide-bearings. In addition to the uniform wedge formation, the high oil film pressure also induces a local elastic deformation of the fixed <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> normal to its surface. The normal <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> deformation and the oil wedge effectively form an elasto-hydrodynamic-lubrication (EHL) pocket, even more effectively increasing the oil film pressure between the sliding surfaces, due to the envelopment of the oil, as confirmed in our companion paper [3], and an earlier, less-detailed contribution [4]. The present study focuses on aspects of EHL that have both positive and negative effects on the lubrication performance of the thrust slide-bearings in scroll compressors. Theoretical calculations using the average Reynolds equation and Patier-Chen solid contact theory, for the boundary of the local elastic deformation of the thrust slide-bearing, were conducted for a small cooling capacity scroll compressor driven at 3600 rpm with 0. 1 kW. An approximate method was developed using characteristic curves to determine the oil film axial force, the average oil film thickness, the frictional force and the frictional coefficient.

The average HHS significantly (p[*]≤[*] 0. 05) improved from 48 (range 18 – 77) points to 95 (range 46 – 100) points. The VAS revealed significant (p[*]≤[*] 0. 05) reduction of pain at rest and under load.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} four {{rating systems}} {{designed to assess}} patients following provision of a <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> prosthesis. Subjects: Sixty-one patients undergoing total hip replacement with <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> prosthesis. Design: Patients were evaluated preoperatively and six months postoperatively by four different hip rating systems (Harris, Iowa, Charnley and Merle d'Aubigne), both on a categorical and on a numerical basis. Setting: Department of orthopaedics and traumatology in a university hospital. Main outcome measures: Patients were evaluated by four rating systems preoperatively and postoperatively either on a categorical or a numerical basis. Results: All patients showed significant improvement after surgery in all rating systems. Although preoperative categorical evaluation revealed that the strongest correlation was between Charnley and Merle d'Aubigne scores (r = 0. 876), numerical comparison of the rating systems showed strong correlation among all systems, both pre- and postoperatively. Responsiveness analysis revealed larger effect size for the Iowa and Harris hip scores. Conclusions: Our results suggest that hip rating systems should be compared numerically rather than by categorical evaluation and that the Iowa and Harris hip scores are more convenient in evaluating <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> prosthesis patients because they have larger effect sizes without floor and ceiling effects...|$|R

The comparisons of the stress distribution between the implanted femursand the healthy femur were performed and the characteristics in the stress shielding of each casewere clarified. Since the load is transferred on the contact surface between the implant and the inner surface of the femur {{in the case of the}} total hip arthroplasty, the stress in the intertrochanteric zone (Gruen zone 7) become very small, and the phenomenon of the stress shielding is confirmed obviously. The stress distributions of the femurs afterthe resurfacing hiparthroplasty and the <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> prosthesis are about the same with that of the healthy femur, so, the possibility of the stress shielding is considered lower compared with the femur after the total hip arthroplasty. However, considering the stress concentration thatwill increase the risk of femoral fracture caused by the screws for the fixation of the implant in the <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> prosthesis, the resurfacing hiparthroplastymay beconcluded as the best method among these three types of implants to avoid stress shielding...|$|R

40|$|In mid-April, 1983, an old {{landslide}} near Thistle, Utah, {{began to}} move, and within days had blocked Spanish Fork Canyon. As the slide 2 ̆ 7 s movement continued, construction crews gradually converted {{the toe of}} the slide into an earth-filled dam [...] Thistle dam [...] that impounded northwest-flowing Spanish Fork River. The resultant reservoir, known as Thistle Lake, was subsequently drained because of uncertainty about {{the stability of the}} dam. Recently, officials of Utah County have explored various alternatives for a water-retention structure in the area, including utilization of Thistle dam. The Thistle Slide Committee, established by the State of Utah to evaluate the suitability of using Thistle dam, suggests that construction of a new dam upstream from the present one might be a more reasonable and cheaper solution than investigating the stability of the present dam. Two potential geologic hazards that could impact a dam site upstream from the Thistle dam, however, may be in the area: the Thistle Canyon fault and the Thistle Creek diapiric fold. Uncertainty shrouds the existence of both. The Thistle Canyon fault is a postulated high-angle normal fault that trends about N. 20 degrees E. through Thistle.

Additional field investigations should be completed to determine the existence of these hazards prior to any final decision about a new dam.
