5|$|Genetics is {{believed}} {{to be involved in the}} majority of cases, either <b>directly</b> <b>or</b> <b>indirectly.</b> Some epilepsies are due to a single gene defect (1–2%); most are due to the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors. Each of the single gene defects is rare, with more than 200 in all described. Most genes involved affect ion channels, either <b>directly</b> <b>or</b> <b>indirectly.</b> These include genes for ion channels themselves, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.|$|E

5|$|The {{avifauna}} of Puerto Rico {{is composed}} of 349 species, 18 of which are endemic to the archipelago. Almost half of the species (166) are accidental, meaning {{that they have been}} sighted only once or twice, and 42 of the species have been introduced, either <b>directly</b> <b>or</b> <b>indirectly</b> (mainly through habitat alteration), by humans. Approximately 120 species, including both native and introduced, breed regularly in the archipelago.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the series}} fictionalises {{the world of}} MI5, several storylines are based on truth. The series had advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The writers also {{research}} heavily on each episode. The producers were keen in world events that Britain and America were <b>directly</b> <b>or</b> <b>indirectly</b> responsible for, where the consequences of an operation are worse than what they intended to resolve in the first place, known as blowback. One example includes the two powers aiding the Afghan Mujahideen in 1989 before {{pulling out of the}} country; this ultimately lead to the rise of Al-Qaeda.|$|E

5|$|As a {{tropical}} cyclone, Patricia's effects in Mexico were tremendous; however, the affected areas were predominantly rural, mitigating a potential large-scale disaster. Violent winds tore roofs from structures and stripped coastal areas of their vegetation. Preliminary assessments indicated hundreds of homes to be destroyed; seven fatalities {{were linked to}} the hurricane <b>directly</b> <b>or</b> <b>indirectly,</b> including one during evacuations. Total damage {{was estimated to be}} in excess of 5.4billion pesos (US$323.3million), with agriculture and infrastructure comprising the majority of losses. Flooding partially associated with remnant moisture from Patricia inflicted US$52.5million in damage across Southern Texas.|$|E

The Turks, Iranians, and Indians all got firearms no later than the 15th century, in each case <b>directly</b> <b>or</b> <b>indirectly</b> from the Europeans. The Japanese did not acquire firearms until the 16th century, and then from the Portuguese rather than the Chinese.|$|E
5|$|Hennessy {{concludes that}} if the un{{dissolved}} and dissolved gas content of a tissue cannot be independently measured either <b>directly</b> <b>or</b> <b>indirectly</b> then the safe maximum limits relative to the ambient pressure cannot be accurately determined through decompression trials {{and it will not}} be possible to systematically develop a comprehensive biophysical model for gas exchange. He proposes a best fit double compartment model for dissolved gas and a single compartment model for undissolved gas as these are the simplest models consistent with available data.|$|E
