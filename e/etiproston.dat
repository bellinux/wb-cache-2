40|$|In a {{field trial}} <b>etiproston</b> (Prostavet®), a {{synthetic}} analogue of prostaglandin F 2 a was used therapeutically, i. e. after diagnosis of retained placenta (fetal membranes were considered retained if not expelled within twelve hours after parturition). The trial was conducted from June 1998 to November 1999 on three commercial dairy farms in Brandenburg, Germany. A total of 293 cows {{were enrolled in}} the study. After withdrawal of animals not fitting the treatment protocol, finally 229 cows were eligible for statistical analysis. On farm A, B and C a total of 77, 62 and 90 cows respectively, remained in the study. In both groups an attempt was made to carefully remove the fetal membranes. After the manipulation an intrauterine antibiotic treatment was administered (treated controls). Cows of the experimental group received a supplementary intramuscular injection of 4 mg <b>etiproston</b> (2 ml Prostavet®) at every treatment. Therapy was continued in two to three day intervals until the placenta was expelled. Animals with rectal temperatures exceeding 39, 5 °C were systemically treated with antibiotics. All cows were examined for endometritis by rectal palpation between days 14 to 20 post partum. Animals that showed signs of endometritis were treated with PGF 2 a (4 mg <b>etiproston).</b> Afterwards they were re-examined two weeks later and in case of endometritis treated again in the same way. The parameters used to measure subsequent reproductive performance were days to first service, days open, service rate, first service conception rate, services per conception and conception rate. Cows not inseminated or found not pregnant at a pre determined time post partum were examined by rectal palpation and treated accordingly. Repeated monthly test day milk yield (Fat Corrected Milk, FCM) was used to evaluate the effect of <b>etiproston</b> treatment during the first four months post partum. The history of each animal was observed up to next pregnancy, culling of the cow or until day 200 post partum. Short-term effects Time from calving to placental expulsion was shorter in the <b>etiproston</b> treated group on farm B (p Medium-term effects Concerning prevalence of endometritis {{there was no difference between}} the experimental groups and the control groups on any farm, neither at first nor at second examination post partum. Long-term effects Treatment of retained placenta with <b>etiproston</b> had no significant effect on reproductive performance on all farms. Causes for infertility did not differ between the study groups on all farms as well. Culling, milk yield Culling frequencies did not differ significantly between the study groups on all farms. On the other hand on farm C more cows of the experimental group were excluded from breeding and considered culled (p The additional use of prostaglandin F 2 a for treatment of retained fetal membranes had some short term effects. However, each effect was achieved on only one of the farms participating in the trial. Differences were not always in favour of the experimental group. Thus the therapeutic regimen in the experimental groups was not cost effective, because especially long-term effects failed to appear. <br...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-four {{postpartum}} Sahiwal cows {{that did}} not show oestrus upto 85 days postpartum were randomly divided into two equal groups, A and B. Group A cows were injected 2 ml Prostavet injection containing 5 mg <b>Etiproston,</b> a synthetic analogue of PGF 2 α (Virbac, France) intramuscularly at day 85 postpartum on chronological basis of calving dates without palpation. A second injection was given 11 days later to those cows {{that did not}} respond to first injection. A third injection was given at 118 days postpartum to those cows that had not responded to 1 st and 2 nd injection of PGF 2 α and did not show oestrus. The cows in group B were not given any treatment and served as control. The cows found in oestrus were artificially inseminated 12 hours after the detection of oestrus. The cumulative oestrus response was higher (66. 66 %) in group A than in group B (25 %). Similarly, in group A the behavioral symptoms and physical changes were more pronounced as compared to group B. Mean (± SE) interval from treatment to onset of oestrus in group A was 96 ± 15. 08 hours whereas, mean interval to oestrus from beginning of experiment was 25. 0 ± 1. 0 days in group B. Statistically non significant difference was observed in the mean duration of oestrus (23. 25 ± 1. 99 vs. 20. 33 ± 1. 45 hours) between animals of the two groups. However, a significant (P< 0. 05) difference was observed for the mean calving to first oestrus interval (89 ± 0. 62 vs. 110 ± 0. 19 days) in groups A and B. From the results, it is concluded that PGF 2 α is useful for treatment of unobserved oestrus in postpartum Sahiwal cows...|$|E
