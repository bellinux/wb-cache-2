30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  6, the {{majority}} of intracellular metabolites had undergone significant fluctuations under different initial glucose concentrations. Intracellular metabolite levels in group C and group D were relatively lower, while the other three groups had higher levels in seed culture. Combined with macroscopic parameter analysis, the reason was possibly as follows. The amounts of cell viability, glucose consumption rate, and the yield of sodium gluconate in group C and group D were higher, where more substrates were directly converted to products on the cell wall and less metabolic <b>flux</b> <b>flowed</b> into the cell. Similarly, the groups A, B, and E with low or high initial glucose concentrations had low glucose consumption rate and product yield, and more metabolic <b>flux</b> <b>flowed</b> to synthesize metabolites responding to environmental stresses for facilitating cell growth. In general, there was a relatively complete strategy for microorganism to respond to osmotic stress, containing the self-synthesis or exogenous uptake of compatible solutes and osmoprotectants, metabolic flux redistribution, and membrane fluidity variations (Schubert et al. 2007; Saum and Müller 2007; Simonin et al. 2008; Varela et al. 2003).|$|R
