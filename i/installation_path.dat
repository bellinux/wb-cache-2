40|$|The {{automotive}} industry of today {{is becoming more}} focused on electrified and hybrid solutions, where both conventional combustion engines and battery supplied electrical engines need to fit in an already densely packed vehicle. Many quality problems are related do flexible parts. In particular, the assembly of electric cables and wiring harnesses is difficult due to its concealed routing, multiple branching points, weights and the flexibility in the material. To avoid late detection of assembly problems, the assembly aspect must be considered early during conceptual design and production preparation with respect to both feasibility and ergonomics. Development of automatic path planning methods in virtual manufacturing tools supporting deformable parts is therefore highly motivated. This article presents a novel method for automatically planning and finding a smooth and collision-free mounting of connectors in a wiring harness <b>installation.</b> Automatic <b>path</b> planning for de formable objects in general is widely acknowledged as a very difficult problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a low-dimensional path planning algorithm that operates in the following way: constraint relaxation, handle path planning, unfolding, path smoothing and handle supplementation.

40|$|In {{the context}} of this {{research}} project a concept for quality assurance of lockbolts connec-tions by monitoring the installation process was developed using the parameters <b>installation</b> <b>path</b> and installation force. For this purpose, initially the process capability of selected lockbolt systems was examined by an analytical consideration of the natural scatter of the installation curves. Next, the effects of typical installation process irregularities were compared both to the process curve {{as well as on the}} bearing behavior of the joined connection determined numerically and with experimental data. From this it was possible to identify some ranges of the installation curve which were effected by installation process irregularities and specific evaluation window are derived. Their implementation enables advanced On-Line - Process monitoring. An advanced process monitoring can be used in addition to the previously customary simple plausibility check for the specific failure diagnosis. Furthermore it is possible by knowledge of the characteristic influence of the irregularities on the bearing behavior, to interrupt the manufacturing process only on the occurrence of critical errors, thus reducing time and cost intensive rework. To reduce the experimental effort special attention was payed to the use of numerical simulation for the automated generation of installation curves to reflect the natural scatter ranges of the real installation process. In conjunction with a sensitivity analysis, the most important influencing variables on the bearing capacities of the joined connection should be identified. Thereby, the procedures for setting up a joining task in SMEs can be optimized, as only the verification of numerically determined installation curves needs to be performed. Requirements for fasteners, installation equipment and installation process monitoring for the prevention and identification of installation process irregularities have been summarized in {{the context of}} a case class concept, which allows the user quality-oriented conception of lockbolt installation processes...|$|E

This study examines (i) whether safety citizenship behaviors are a product of social exchanges between employees and organizations, and (ii) the organizational exchanges (i. e. actual activities to support employees) that underlie this relationship. We studied this in the offshore oil and gas industry, and investigated whether organizational activities for supporting workforce health are a signal to employees that the organization supports them, and an antecedent to safety citizenship behaviors. Using questionnaires, we collected data from employees (n = 820) and medics (n = 30) on 22 offshore <b>installations.</b> Multi-level <b>path</b> analysis found that where activities to support workforce health were greater, offshore employees {{were more likely to}} perceive their organization to support them, and in turn report more commitment to the organization and safety citizenship behaviors. This indicates safety citizenship behaviors are a product of social exchange, and provides insight on how organizations can influence employee engagement in them. It also suggests social exchange theory as a useful framework for investigating how organizational safety is influenced by workforce relations. We contributed to the social exchange literature through conceptualizing and demonstrating how organizational exchanges lead to reciprocal employee citizenship behaviors...|$|R

40|$|This dataset package {{contains}} {{the results of}} fault injection experiments for RTL and implementation-level models 3 microprocessors (LEON 3, MC 8051, PIC). 1. Package contents: - raw traces of fault injection experiments: *. lst files - analysis results grouped by fault models: *. html files in the /REPORT subfolders - summary for each targeted HDL model and fault model: index. html in each design folder To facilitate the navigation through the contents, it is organized as a tree of *. html pages. The root page is 'index. html' in the archive root. Additionally, to observe the raw traces for each experiment in the convenient form, the *. lst files are processed on the fly by custom python-script, returning the interactive *. html page. Each observation trace is a table, where: - each row represents an observation vector, comprising {simulation time stamp}, {flags}, {internal state}, {outputs}. - each cell is highlighted: a) green if matches with reference trace (fault-free simulation), b) red if mismatches with reference trace, denoting error for internals / failure for outputs, c) violet in case of vector whose timestamp was not in reference (unexpected transition). These highlighting options can be customized by modifying the linked *. css files. 2. Installation 2. 1 Ensure to have Web-Server installed (Apache preferable). For instance, XAMPP: [URL] 2. 2 Ensure to have python ver. 2. x installed. Type in terminal (cmd console in Windows) : “python [...] version” – if the output looks like > Python 2. x. x – python is installed. Otherwise install the relevant 2. x. x distribution: [URL] Add python <b>installation</b> <b>path</b> to environment path variable. 2. 2 Ensure that Web-server is configured to execute CGI scripts, particularly python-scripts: In the '[URL] file (XAMMP control panel – button config in front of apache module) : – search for line Options Indexes FollowSymLinks and add ExecCGI, so the resulting line looks like this: Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI – search for #AddHandler cgi-script. cgi, uncomment (remove #), and append “. py” to this line, so the resulting line: AddHandler cgi-script. cgi. pl. asp. py 2. 3 Unpack the *. zip package into the folder on the Web Server. For instance 'Web-server root folder'/ExperimentalResults. The Web-Server root can be configured in the ‘[URL] file in the DocumentRoot section, for instance: DocumentRoot "F:/HTWEB" [...] . 2. 4 In the web-browser navigate to the root directory of extracted package: [URL] 3.

30|$|In general, {{managing}} {{the density of}} trees, the design of <b>paths,</b> <b>installation</b> of facilities such as billboards and arbors, and management plans that secure all of these aspects are potential challenges to enhancing the physical and mental restorative effect of the forest. However, because the forest environment itself is composed {{of a variety of}} flora and fauna, and facilities age quickly, it is essential to consider the cost of constructing these facilities (which must be new) and maintaining the diversity of animals and plants, which is the infrastructure of the forest. For example, if we need to implement a forest management method that involves reducing the tree density by at least 16 – 17 % and the total basal area by 9 – 10 %, the removal of primarily small-diameter and suppressed trees will achieve this while maintaining the forest’s mental and physical restorative effects and, at the same time, reducing management costs. Thus, we can propose to develop a rational and sustainable management method that protects large-diameter trees to ensure future management funds.|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} abstraction level of embedded system models, System Level Description Languages(SLDL), like SystemC or SpeC, have been increasingly {{used as the}} design entrance. Having a well described system level model, tools can gradually synthesize them into lower level until the final netlist implementation. However, accompanying {{with the increase of}} design ability, new bottlenecks are generated. Many of the system level models are recoded from legacy C reference code, and most of the recoding is nowadays done manually by designers. Due to tedious work, this process is error-prone, time-consuming, {{and the quality of the}} final system level model is unstable. This problem has been addressed by a designer-controlled Recoding Integrated Development Environment (RIDE). With both a textual and a graphic editor and a set of analysis and transformation tools, the designer can re-code C reference code into a system level model more efficiently. In this report, we describe an Eclipse-based software platform for RIDE which can serve as a robust and extensible framework for RIDE software development and implementation.

40|$|Submarine slope {{failures}} are {{a well-known}} geohazard. They {{are able to}} destroy seafloor <b>installations</b> along their <b>path</b> and by generating tsunamis they may threaten coastal infrastructures. While the mechanisms involved in submarine landslide generation remain poorly known, there are observations that slope stability can be reduced {{in the presence of}} free gas. Here, we present new high-resolution 3 D seismic data from the Eivissa Channel between the Iberian Penninsula and the Balearic Promontory in the Western Mediterranean Sea. The data reveal slope stability reduction in this area at least since mid-Quaternary times, and an intimate relationship between fluid migration and slope stability. We show that two landslides, i. e. pre-Ana Slide and Ana Slide, occurred at almost the same location above an erosional channel in the Messinian unconformity. There is seismic evidence that fluids including gas are migrating upwards through this erosional surface and that they charge sedimentary layers {{at the base of the}} Ana Slide possibly reducing its strength and predisposing it to failure. Our data show in unprecedented detail the ways in which the presence of gas influences slope stability. The findings illustrate the importance of including high-resolution 3 D seismic data in slope stability and tsunami risk assessments to identify shallow gas distribution as one of the main controls on slope stability in gas prone areas...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{investigation of the}} operating characteristics of the glide path equipment of the Instrument Landing System {{was made in the}} eleven week period which comprises the Winter Term of the third year in the Electronics Engineering course of instruction at the U. S. Naval Postgraduate School at Annapolis, Maryland. The field work was done at the Federal Telecommunication Laboratory at the Westchester County Airport, White Plains, New York. There the author assisted Mr. Sidney Pickles in a series of air and ground tests on a glide <b>path</b> <b>installation.</b> The tests covered the period from January 3, 1949 to March 18, 1949. The tests were made in an attempt to complete the theory of operation of a piece of equipment which has been in actual operation {{in all parts of the}} world for several years. The difficulty of making measurements on the glide path (the useful glide path lies almost entirely at distances above the ground which cannot be probed from the ground) and the inadequate equipments and techniques for making measurements at the glide path frequency has left several factors uninvestigated and the inter-relation of many factors open to considerable question. While Mr. Pickles and the author feel that their work has added to the knowledge of the theory of operation of the equipment they are convinced that the theory is still inadequate to explain some of the phenomena observed during the test period.

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} use of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) as an {{approach}} to the increasingly difficult air sampling challenges {{within the field of}} occupational and environmental hygiene. The application of FTIR is exemplified by the assessment of emissions from and exposures in the sawmill and pellet industries. Open path FTIR was applied in the sawsheds and the terpene levels were monitored for several days. Traditional adsorbent sampling was used to evaluate the FTIR measurements. The volatile emissions from wood pellets were investigated in warehouses and in domestic storage rooms. The <b>installation</b> of open <b>path</b> FTIR in the harsh sawmill environment proved useful, however, attention must be paid to vibrations, beam blockage and limited sensitivity. Adsorbent sampling showed good agreement with open path FTIR. The uncontrolled airflows in sawsheds caused significant underestimation of emission rates. By {{the use of}} FTIR and a tracer gas a more accurate estimate was obtained. The total emission from processing of Scots pine was estimated to 660 g/m 3 of roundwood under bark, and can amount to 700 tons annually from a large sawmill. Hexanal (111 ± 32 mg/m 3) and CO (56 ± 4 mg/m 3) were recorded in pellet warehouses. Storage of wood pellets constitutes a potential occupational and domestic health hazard. Experiments from kiln drying of lumber show that the emissions of hexanal and carbon monoxide are not limited to wood pellets but are caused by general degradation processes of wood, facilitated by drying at elevated temperature. This is the first published report where low-temperature emission of carbon monoxide from wood materials is described. The FTIR method is a significant advancement in measurement technology. The retrieved data offers unparalleled information. It offers robust, convenient and efficient monitoring of gases over extended periods. FTIR spectroscopy should be considered a standard technique within the field of occupational and environmental hygiene...|$|R
40|$|The precise {{flow-rate}} measurement is a {{basic problem}} in the management and the exploitation of a hydraulic power-plant. The efficiency characterisation of an hydraulic machinery or of a water distribution net {{is linked to the}} accurate knowledge of the flow-rate. As well as the usual measurement methods, acoustic discharge measurement has become of great importance during the last ten years, specially due to the last development in the field of electronic and signal processing. The acoustic flow measurement uncertainties show that geometry, integration method, influence of the flow field and the interaction between the acoustic transducer and the pipe have an important influence on the measurement accuracy. In this work, the influence of the flow field on the accuracy is of great importance. To estimate the uncertainties of the acoustic discharge measurement for disturbed flow fields, laboratory tests are carried out at the hydraulic machinery laboratory LMH in order to qualify the measurement accuracy depending on the upstream distortion induced by different typical pipe configurations. Furthermore, numerical flow computations with software packages are performed to simulate the turbulent flow profiles at the location of the acoustic flow measurement. These simulations are performed for laboratory and also industrial flow configurations. Comparative discharge measurements for typical disturbed flow fields are performed on a special test rig of LMH between a reference electromagnetic flow meter and an 8 paths in two crossed planes acoustic flow-meter. The accuracy analysis, based upon all laboratory measurements shows that globally the measurement quality is excellent even {{in the case of a}} heavily disturbed flow field in the meter section. A specific analysis has to be performed at the flow-rate measurement installation in order to take into account the pipe configuration influence (for example an elbow or a gate), the developing length between the meter section and the disturbance and finally the use of crossed planes. Such analysis allows the reduction of the acoustic measurement uncertainties. The protrusion effect can also introduce an important measurement error in the acoustic measurement. Laboratory measurements in the high speed cavitation tunnel of LMH show clearly the influence of the protrusion effect. In such small dimensions in comparison with the industrial pipes, these effects are amplified and they introduce important errors. The second part of this work is based on the simulation of the velocity profiles at the location of the metering section by numerical flow computations. Comparisons between numerical results and Laser Doppler flow measurements show that the simulation and the flow physics results are in agreement with each other. Based on these convincing results, numerical flow computations are performed for an industrial power-plant in order to obtain an approximation of the flow profile in the metering section. Based on these results, an optimisation of the acoustic <b>path</b> <b>installation</b> is proposed in order to limit the uncertainties due to the flow-field in the pipe. This study is applied to the laboratory configurations and allows one to find the optimum measured orientations of the acoustic paths. Finally, this study also applies to an industrial installation...|$|R
