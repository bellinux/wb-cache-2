25|$|Oedipus summons {{the blind}} prophet Tiresias for help. When Tiresias arrives {{he claims to}} <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to Oedipus's questions, but refuses to speak, instead telling him to abandon his search. Oedipus is enraged by Tiresias' refusal, and {{verbally}} accuses him of complicity in Laius' murder. Outraged, Tiresias tells the king that Oedipus himself is the murderer ("You yourself are the criminal you seek"). Oedipus cannot see how this could be, and concludes that the prophet must have been paid off by Creon {{in an attempt to}} undermine him. The two argue vehemently, as Oedipus mocks Tiresias' lack of sight, and Tiresias in turn tells Oedipus that he himself is blind. Eventually Tiresias leaves, muttering darkly that when the murderer is discovered he shall be a native citizen of Thebes, brother and father to his own children, and son and husband to his own mother.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{problems}} encountered will benefit from special attention, as problems are often related more to “input and output” issues than to intellectual impairment. Problems with eye movement control {{make it difficult for}} people with A-T to read, yet most fully understand the meaning and nuances of text that is read to them. Delays in speech initiation and lack of facial expression make it seem that they do not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to questions. Reduction of the skilled effort needed to answer questions, and an increase of the time available to respond, is often rewarded by real accomplishment. It {{is important to recognize that}} intellectual disability is not regularly a part of the clinical picture of A-T although school performance may be suboptimal because of the many difficulties in reading, writing, and speech. Children with A-T are often very conscious of their appearance, and strive to appear normal to their peers and teachers. Life within the ataxic body can be tiring. The enhanced effort needed to maintain appearances and increased energy expended in abnormal tone and extra movements all contribute to physical and mental fatigue. As a consequence, for some a shortened school day yields real benefits.|$|E

2500|$|Medawar {{was also}} a realist in {{pointing}} out in his book [...] "Advice to a Young Scientist" [...] {{that there is no}} quicker way for a scientist to bring discredit on himself and his profession particularly when no declaration is called for, than to declare that science knows or will <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to all questions worth asking.

The Whistle Jock's announcement may be as simple as naming the upcoming event and the uniform to be worn, or as complex as including the weather, the menu for chow, the Sergeant and/or Officer of the Day, and special announcements requested by upperclassmen. For evening chow, several fish from each outfit run [...] "fish of the Day," [...] setting up their outfit's table(s) at Duncan Dining Hall prior to formation, then returning to the dorms immediately after chow to assist seniors in removing their boots.|$|E

50|$|Counter Strategy by the Seller:The Seller (who {{may or may}} not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer)</b> would {{pretend that}} he <b>knows</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> and is trustworthy. He would also try to guess whether <b>the</b> Player {{actually}} <b>knows</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> or is bluffing. If the Seller feels that <b>the</b> Player <b>knows</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer,</b> <b>the</b> Seller may have no option but to agree to the Player’s offer. But, if the Seller feels that the Player is bluffing, he would keep on increasing his bid. If the final amount agreed by the Player is not satisfactory to the Seller, he may give a misleading <b>answer</b> to <b>the</b> Player (remember the Seller would anyway get the agreed amount whether <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> is right or wrong). The Player then would have to decide whether to go with <b>the</b> sellers <b>answer</b> or not.

It was a flunk, and that was all there was to it. No need for him to look at the rest of the questions, and even if he did <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to two or three, there was no use in writing them down. It would not prevent the flunk. Besides, his arm hurt him too much to write. It hurt his eyes to look at the blackboard, and his eyes hurt even when they were closed; and it seemed positively to hurt him to think.|$|E
6000|$|None {{the less}} I thought {{a good deal}} about birthdays that afternoon, and {{wondered}} how it was that we human beings can bear even to go on living between two such mysteries as {{the beginning and the end}} of life. Where was my mother now? Where was I but two-and-twenty years ago? What was all this [...] "Past," [...] this [...] "History," [...] of which I had heard so much and knew so little? Just a story? Better brains than mine have puzzled over these questions, and perhaps if I had studied the philosophers I should <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers.</b> In the evenings, wrapped up in a shawl, Pollie carried me downstairs, and we took a sober whispering walk in the hush and perfumes of the deserted garden. Loud rang the tongues of the water over the stones. The moths were fluttering to their trysts, and from some dark little coign the cricket strummed me a solo. Standing up there in the starry night the great house looked down on me like an elder brother, mute but compassionate.|$|E
