5|$|Immense {{quantities}} {{of dust and}} coal rose {{high into the air}} in an inverted cone...In the village of Heworth, this cloud caused a darkness like that of early twilight and covered the roads so thickly that the footsteps of passengers were deeply imprinted in <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the explosion was heard, wives and children of the workmen ran to the pit. Wildness and terror were pictured in every countenance. The crowd soon collected to several hundreds, some crying out for a husband, others for a parent or a son, and all affected by a mixture of horror, anxiety and grief.|$|E

Gage granted the leave, directing Colonel Campbell to give <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible. Campbell, whose officer ranks had been depleted in the Caribbean campaign, would only grant the leave after the upcoming expedition.|$|E

5|$|Although Pytka {{fixed the}} ideas on a storyboard, he {{abandoned}} <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> filming began, and followed ideas {{based on what}} angles and perspectives the steadycam camera produced. One instance was the filming of the car crash, which Pytka filmed for hours from above, but realised that a steadycam shot on the ground was a much better idea. Archive footage was used by imposing it on scenes shot by Pytka, who utilised a greenscreen stage to digitally blend it into the finished film, such as Paul's Old English Sheepdog in the graveyard, and the elephant in the ballroom procession scene. The elephant was put in last, as Aspinall phoned Pytka and said that Starr liked the scene, but insisted an elephant be put in it, which Pytka later did, as he had already put a sitar in {{at the request of}} Harrison. Apart from the steadycam shots, Pytka used a Russian-made Akil-crane for sweeping overhead shots, such as the Abbey Road zebra crossing shot at the end, as well as a remote-controlled toy helicopter with a camera added to it for intricate aerial shots. To make it more interesting, two Blue Meanies make cameos.|$|E
5|$|Amanda {{encounters}} several antagonists {{over the}} course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These foes can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means. There is also a single alien creature that pursues the player. The alien creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the alien finding the player. For example, if the alien is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract the alien, forcing the player to wisely use the tracker and remove <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine whether the alien creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.|$|E

25|$|When the Sun is active, strong solar flares {{can occur}} that {{will hit the}} sunlit side of Earth with hard X-rays. The X-rays will {{penetrate}} to the D-region, releasing electrons that will rapidly increase absorption, causing a high frequency (3–30nbsp&MHz) radio blackout. During this time very low frequency (3–30nbsp&kHz) signals will be reflected by the D layer instead of the E layer, where the increased atmospheric density will usually increase the absorption of the wave and thus dampen <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the X-rays end, the sudden ionospheric disturbance (SID) or radio black-out ends as the electrons in the D-region recombine rapidly and signal strengths return to normal.|$|E
25|$|Adrienne was {{abandoned}} {{for a younger}} woman by her husband. She parented their children alone {{and took care of}} her sick father. This had worn her down. So when an opportunity comes along to tend an inn in the small coastal town of Rodanthe, North Carolina for a friend, Adrienne decides to do <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> she arrives, a major storm is forecast. Meanwhile, Paul, a fifty-four-year-old father, arrives in Rodanthe. He has sold his home and practice, and now wishes to travel to an isolated place where he can seek relief from his shattered life. A successful surgeon, he has recently divorced from his wife, and has had a patient die.|$|E
25|$|So it {{was that}} on 2 August 1907 the Act was passed, {{empowering}} the North British Railway to construct Methil no 3 Dock and associated railway connections; the NBR was required to complete <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible. Wemyss withdrew his Bill, and in 1908 the NBR let a contract to Robert McAlpine for the no 3 Dock. It was to be located east of the earlier docks and was undoubtedly very large. The single track crossing of the River Leven was to be widened to four tracks, and considerable additional sidings accommodation was to be provided. The railway facilities alone were to cost £50,000. As part of the scheme, Leven Harbour, already badly silted up, was closed.|$|E

25|$|Other {{potential}} and threatening diseases include rabbit haemorrhagic disease in New Zealand and flystrike. Although strike {{is not limited}} to blow flies, these maggots are a major source of this skin invasion, causing lesions, which, if severe enough, may be lethal. Strike starts when blow flies lay eggs in a wound or fecal material present on the sheep. When the maggots hatch, they begin feeding on the sheep and thus irritating <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the first wave of maggots hatch, they attract more blow flies, causing the strike. Insecticides are available for blow fly prevention, and precautionary measures may be taken, such as docking tails, shearing, and keeping the sheep healthy overall.|$|E
25|$|Tensions soon arose {{between the}} two parties. Batticaloa was the {{traditional}} port of the Kandyan kingdom (Trincomalee had long been lost, first to the Jaffna kingdom {{and then to the}} Portuguese), and Rajasingha was eager to acquire <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible. The Dutch, however, demurred, demanding full payment for their assistance in displacing the Portuguese. Despite a rising suspicion that the Dutch were not in Sri Lanka to expel the Portuguese, so much as to replace them, the alliance was one that was too valuable for Rajasingha to simply cancel, and joint Dutch–Kandyan efforts resulted in the seizure of Galle on 13 March 1640 and the restriction of Portuguese power to the west coast of Sri Lanka by 1641.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the Kearney attack, there were half a dozen similar attacks (See table), though none of the purported victims were able to provide a clear description of the prowler, and no clues were found {{at the scene of}} the attacks. The first specimen of physical evidence was found on the night of September 5, when Carl and Beulah Cordes of North 21st Street returned home around 10:00 pm. After spending a few minutes in the house they noticed a piece of white cloth, slightly larger than a man's handkerchief, sitting on their porch next to the screen door. Beulah Cordes picked up the cloth and smelled <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> she inhaled, she became violently ill. She described the effect as being similar to an electric shock. Her face quickly began to swell, she experienced a burning sensation in her mouth and throat, and began to vomit. As with other victims, she also reported feeling weak and experiencing partial paralysis of her legs. Beulah Cordes later hypothesized that the cloth had been left on the porch in order to knock out the family dog, which usually slept there, so that the prowler could gain access to the house unnoticed.|$|E

25|$|The game is {{presented}} {{against the background}} {{of the history of the}} One Ring. At the dawn of the Second Age, after the defeat of the Dark Lord, Morgoth, the elves of Eregion forged the nineteen Rings of Power to help themselves, the dwarves and men rule Middle-earth. However, the elves were unaware that Sauron, Morgoth's closest ally, had survived his master's defeat, and in the guise of Annatar had been the one who taught the Elven-smiths, led by Celebrimbor, how to forge the Rings, whilst, in secret, he forged his own One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom, a Ring far more powerful than any of the others. However, in order for the One Ring to be powerful enough to control the other Rings, Sauron had to transfer most of his power into <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> he put it on, the elves became aware of his ruse, removing and hiding their Three Rings, which Celebrimbor had forged without Sauron's aid. Sauron waged war on the elves, conquering much of Middle-earth and killing Celebrimbor. Thus began the Dark Years, when Sauron took possession of the remaining sixteen Rings, giving seven to the dwarves and nine to men in an effort to corrupt them. The dwarves proved relatively immune to the powers of the Rings, acquiring only a greed for gold, and becoming unconcerned with events in the wider world. Men proved less resilient, and the nine kings given the Rings become the nine Ring-wraiths, or Nazgûl, led by the Witch-king of Angmar.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Observer, co-creator Mark Gatiss says that they experienced more difficulty finding the right actor to play Dr John Watson than they had for the title character.

Once Benedict was there it was really just making sure we got the chemistry for John —and I think you get <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> they come into the room, you can see that they work together". Several actors auditioned for the part of Watson, and Martin Freeman eventually took the role. Steven Moffat said that Matt Smith was the first to audition unsuccessfully. He was rejected for being too [...] "barmy", as the producers required someone [...] "straighter" [...] for Watson. Shortly after, Moffat cast Smith as the Eleventh Doctor in Doctor Who.|$|E
