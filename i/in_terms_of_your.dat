He was great friends with Sookie's half-fairy grandfather Fintan, and so he became a sponsor to Fintan's descendants and was required {{to give them a}} gift. He had the power of telepathy and thought it a great gift to Fintan's family, as it would give them an edge over their fellow humans to know what other people were thinking and planning. Fintan and Adele drank Cataliades' blood (although Adele was tricked into it, as Cataliades mixed it with her wine), and from then on Fintan and Adele passed on to most of their descendants the power of telepathy. However, Cataliades revealed, only the descendants who, like Sookie's grandmother Adele, had the essential spark would inherit the telepathy. When asked what the essential spark was, Cataliades responded, [...] "It isn't easy to pin down <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> DNA. It's an openness to the other world. Some humans literally can't believe there are creatures in another world besides ours, creatures who have feelings and rights and beliefs and deserve to live their own lives. Humans who are born with the essential spark are born to experience or perform something wonderful, something amazing." [...] Although Adele had the essential spark Fintan did not want her to have the gift. When each Stackhouse child was born Cataliades came and inspected them to see if they had the gift.|$|E

40|$|Self-efficacy is a {{construct}} that describes how confident people {{believe they are}} or how much control they believe they have {{in their ability to}} reach a goal or accomplish a task (Bandura, 1997).

Both constructs are influential in terms of task choice, performance, effort, and perseverance (Bandura, 1997; Reynolds, 1988). High levels of self-efficacy are reliable predictors of academic achievement (Bandura, Barbaranelli, Caprara 2 ̆ 6 Pastorelli, 1996); self-concept is also thought to be a reliable predictor of the same.

40|$|Systematic {{violations}} {{of the rights of}} unauthorized migrants on the fault lines between developed and developing countries expose the dialectic of transnationalism, a dynamic that occurs when both policy and judicial review go transnational. Three concurrent patterns define the dialectic: First, executive and judicial networks are bifurcated from each other, producing significant policies beyond the reach of judiciaries. Second, judiciaries exacerbate their bifurcation from policymaking through transnational decisions. Third, transnational law replaces absolute legal rules with pragmatic problem solving, eroding the normative basis of human rights. Although these patterns seem to show that the violations are an intractable feature of contemporary international law, this Article proposes countering them with “critical absolutism. ” This approach identifies opportunities in which the dialectic can be challenged by presenting states with an existential dilemma: either treat people as humans and risk changing who you are (in terms of the composition of your population), or give up human rights and risk changing who you are (<b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> constitutive commitments) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I will outline {{the way that}} the {{immediate}} post-war past has become mobilized in dominant ideas about the state of parenting and children’s upbringing in contemporary Britain, with the claim that the last fifty years or so have seen deterioration in parenting skills.

In particular, I will focus on ideas about parental responsibility <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> knowing where <b>your</b> children are to highlight the different understandings of children and their welfare needs in the past. By today’s standards the parenting norms and practices that are revealed in the data from some of the classic, well-regarded community studies of the 1960 s would likely be condemned as irresponsible, personally damaging, and in some cases criminal.

30|$|When you meditate {{and bring}} {{conscious}} awareness to your breathing, you are activating the neural pathways associated with conscious control and overriding those that typically cause your breathing pattern (depth {{of breath and}} rate) to be a completely unconscious process. In general, our bodies 'know' how much we should breathe {{in order to meet}} the metabolic demands of the moment (need for oxygen and the need to remove the excess carbon dioxide we are producing). An altered breathing pattern (for example, breath of fire in Kundalini yoga) is something that you are imposing on the body. This may account for the difficulty in correctly and effectively engaging in various breathing regimens while meditating. It also explains the fact that you cannot maintain an imposed, voluntary, breathing pattern indefinitely. Over time, you will ultimately revert back to the unconscious and optimal pattern (optimal in terms of metabolism, not necessarily <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> meditative goals). As in all things, practice improves the ability to establish and maintain an imposed voluntary breathing pattern but you will always have to engage the thinking and planning portions of the brain located in the cerebral cortex to continue breathing this way.|$|E

40|$|Kurzman was a {{graduate}} of Haverford College in political science and economics and there, he was learned that after graduated, he would be particularly interested in focusing on international relations. At that time, he remembers there being a choice, basically, between the Fletcher School and Johns Hopkins, SAIS, and he chose SAIS for its location (he much preferred being in Washington, D. C., for this field). He also came to SAIS as he appreciated the three-part curriculum with a language, an area specialization requirement and a subject matter requirement. At that time, Kurzman remembers the school being quite small (about 200 students) and they all studied in the old, red brick building on Florida Avenue. They developed close relationships {{and there was a lot}} of interaction out of the classroom. He also recalls living on Wyoming Street with other students, several international, and that it was walking distance from the school (in Adams Morgan). During the summer, he was able to do work in the field as an intern and then was later hired as a research assistant for USAID and got to do some teaching. Eventually, this led him to the State Department, which is where he started his career. After working for five years in the State Department for the USAID program (where he worked part of the time in Washington, D. C., and part traveling to Africa and living in East Africa, where he met his wife), he decided to go into the private sector where he could continue efforts in the international realm, but work in a smaller environment. So he was hired by a consulting firm that did lots of work with the World Bank and other international organizations and spent the rest of his career working for such firms, in 50 different countries. In that time, he lived seven or eight years in Africa, and also lived in Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, the Philippines, Uganda, Cameroon and Malawi. He enjoyed Malawi the most where he met his wife who was from the West Indies and resident of England at the time. He lived in Malawi twice during his career, and the second time he lived there, he worked closely on efforts related to refugees from Mozambique. He has now been retired for five years. During his career, if he was not living overseas, he was living in Rockville, MD. When his wife passed away (recently), he moved down to Florida (Gulf Coast), which is where he resides now. During the interview, we also focused the camera on four of his photographs that sit on the wall of the Alumni Relations Office. He described each one as the camera gave a close of look of them, one at a time. One photograph was taken of pelicans in Florida. Another was of an alligator in Florida. The third one was taken in Berkina Faso at a market place. The last of four was taken at Lake Como of some gardens. Photography is a hobby of his and since he has moved to Florida, he devotes a good deal more time to this effort (and, in fact, was wearing a camera around his neck during the interview). <b>In</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> advice he has for current students today, he says, “consider strongly the type of work environment in which you want to work (e. g. large organization or small, international or not, profit or non-profit, etc.) …. also, if you are going to live overseas for a good deal of the time, that has personal consequences <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> moving <b>your</b> household for a couple of years at a time.
