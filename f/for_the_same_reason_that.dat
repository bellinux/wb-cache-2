25|$|By Mach's principle, spacetime is dragged {{along with}} mass-energy, with the distant stars on cosmological scales {{or with a}} black hole in close proximity. Thus, matter tends to spin-up around {{rotating}} black holes, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> pulsars spin down by shedding angular momentum in radiation to infinity.

25|$|The {{argument}} from irreducible complexity is {{a descendant of}} the teleological argument for God (the {{argument from}} design or from complexity). This states that because certain things in nature appear very complicated, {{they must have been}} designed. William Paley famously argued, in his 1802 watchmaker analogy, that complexity in nature implies a God <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the existence of a watch implies the existence of a watchmaker. This argument has a long history, and one can trace it back {{at least as far as}} Cicero's De Natura Deorum ii.34, written in 45 BC.|$|E
25|$|However, {{pressure}} from the Admiralty kept microwaves in everyone's mind. While the 1.5m sets were fine for detecting larger ships, they could not effectively see smaller objects, like U-Boat conning towers. This was <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> antennas need to be {{roughly the size of}} the wavelength; to provide a reasonable reflection, the objects need to be at several times larger than the wavelength. The Admiralty had the advantage of administering the UK's vacuum tube development efforts, under the Communication Valve Development Committee (CVD), and were able to continue development of suitable tubes.|$|E

25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} misconception, water {{rotation}} in home bathrooms {{under normal circumstances}} {{is not related to}} the Coriolis effect or to the rotation of the Earth, and no consistent difference in rotation direction between toilet drainage in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres can be observed. The formation of a vortex over the plug hole may be explained by the conservation of angular momentum: The radius of rotation decreases as water approaches the plug hole, so the rate of rotation increases, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> an ice skater's rate of spin increases as they pull their arms in. Any rotation around the plug hole that is initially present accelerates as water moves inward.|$|E
25|$|It was {{probably}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the triumphal arch, the Arch of Trajan, was erected {{there by the}} senate and people of Rome and constructed by the architect Apollodorus of Damascus in 114. The Arch of Trajan {{is one of the}} best-preserved Roman structures in the Campania. It repeats the formula of the Arch of Titus in the Roman Forum, with reliefs of Trajan's life and exploits of his reign. Some of the sculptures are in the British Museum. Successive emperors seem to have bestowed on the city accessions of territory, and erected, or at least given name to, various public buildings. For administrative purposes it was first included, together {{with the rest of the}} Hirpini, in the second region of Augustus, but was afterwards annexed to Campania and placed under the control of the consular of that province. Its inhabitants were included in the Stellatine tribe. Beneventum retained its importance down to the close of the Empire, and though during the Gothic wars it was taken by Totila, and its walls razed to the ground, they were restored, as well as its public buildings, shortly after; and P. Diaconus speaks of it as a very wealthy city, and the capital of all the surrounding provinces.|$|E
500|$|Critics also {{state that}} {{evolution}} {{is not a}} fact. In science a fact is a verified empirical observation while in colloquial contexts a fact can simply refer to anything {{for which there is}} overwhelming evidence. For example, in common usage theories such as [...] "the Earth revolves around the Sun" [...] and [...] "objects fall due to gravity" [...] may be referred to as [...] "facts," [...] even though they are purely theoretical. From a scientific standpoint, therefore, evolution may be called a [...] "fact" [...] <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> gravity can: under the scientific definition, evolution is an observable process that occurs whenever a population of organisms genetically changes over time. Under the colloquial definition, the theory of evolution can also be called a fact, referring to this theory's well-established nature. Thus, evolution is widely considered both a theory and a fact by scientists.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{positively}} {{received the}} song, complimenting Minaj's cameo and the track's production and lyrics. Andrew Winistorfer of Prefix Magazine thought that Usher {{should have gone}} with [...] "Lil Freak" [...] as the album's first big single, saying, [...] "It (OMG) doesn't come close to matching the filthy heights of [...] "Little Freak ..." [...] He also said the song was [...] "by a wide margin, the best track to be leaked from Usher's long-delayed Raymond vs. Raymond album". In his initial reaction, he pointed out flaws of the song, but said that the song [...] "could become unavoidable if it gets traction on radio". Chris Ryan of MTV News called the song, [...] "slick, sexy hip-hop-infused R done to its finest". He also called the song [...] "nothing short of freak nasty," [...] and [...] "is so full of sexy sexuality that it's enough to make Tiger Woods blush". Vibe magazine commented that [...] "wedding ring is definitely off on this Usher cut", and that Nicki Minaj stole {{the scene in the}} song. Pitchfork Media commented favourably on the songs explicit nature, stating the song [...] "isn't some R. Kelly-esque devotional hymn to sexual addiction", and that [...] "The whole towering mess makes a drunken 3 a.m. threesome sound like the most epic endeavor anyone could hope for.." [...] The review also compared the song to Justin Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River", stating, [...] "it pushes into [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] territory <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] transcended: the gigantic, operatic backing track".|$|E

That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism, which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is [...] "completely without any power… as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery".|$|E

2500|$|Most {{television}} commercials are compressed heavily (typically to a dynamic range {{of no more}} than 3dB) to achieve near-maximum perceived loudness while staying within permissible limits. This is the explanation for a problem that TV viewers and listeners have noticed for years: [...] While commercials receive heavy compression <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> radio broadcasters have traditionally used it (to achieve a [...] "loud" [...] audio image), TV program material, particularly old movies with soft dialogue, is comparatively uncompressed by TV stations. This results in commercials seeming to be much louder than the television programs.|$|E
2500|$|Radó {{showed that}} S is noncomputable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> Σ is noncomputable — it grows {{faster than any}} computable function.
