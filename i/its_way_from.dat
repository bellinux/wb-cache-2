5|$|By 1926, NY31 was {{assigned}} across western and central New York, utilizing Monroe Avenue from downtown Rochester to Pittsford. Although NY96's modern routing via East Avenue was state-maintained and formerly part of legislative Route20 from current NY31F westward, NY15 initially remained on Monroe Avenue, creating an overlap between NY15 and NY31. It was realigned {{at some point}} between 1927 and 1932 to follow East Avenue to Rochester instead. In southern Seneca County, NY15 initially passed through Lodi on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> Interlaken to Ovid.

5|$|The {{planners}} envisaged that a {{war with}} Japan would have three phases: while the garrison of Singapore defended the fortress, the fleet would make <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> home waters to Singapore, sally to relieve or recapture Hong Kong, and blockade the Japanese home islands to force Japan to accept terms. The idea of invading Japan was rejected as impractical, but British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. Aware {{of the impact of}} a blockade on an island nation {{at the heart of a}} maritime empire, they felt that economic pressure would suffice.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} later, Leake {{received}} {{the news that}} a convoy of 20 transport ships carrying supplies and reinforcements was on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> Lisbon, escorted by four men-of-war. Adverse winds and currents meant that {{he was unable to}} sail to assist it against a French naval force that had left Cadiz, and he was forced to wait to see if the convoy would reach its destination. On 18 December, nine of the transports reached the bay, accompanied by two men-of-war, with another seven arriving on 20 December. Four were missing, having been intercepted by the French; three of them had been sunk or captured while the last one eventually made it to Gibraltar at the end of December. They brought with them 2,200 men from the Grenadier Guards, Donegal's Foot and Barrymore's Foot, plus some Dutch troops, guns and supplies of powder, tools and food. Further reinforcements arrived between 16–18 January. With Gibraltar safe for the moment, Leake left for Lisbon on 3 January with sick and wounded members of the garrison aboard his ships.|$|E
5|$|A {{historic}} Native American path used to {{pass through}} the water gap of Leggetts Creek on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> the headwaters of the Lehigh River to the Great Bend on the Susquehanna River near the Pennsylvania/New York border. Some mining and quarrying operations have been done in the watershed and the Leggetts Gap Railroad was built through Leggetts Gap in the 19th century. In the late 19th, 20th, and early 21st centuries, numerous bridges were constructed across the creek. Wild trout naturally reproduce within the creek and several other species have been observed in its waters as well. Some reaches of the creek have a riparian buffer consisting of old growth forests. In other places, there are grasslands or invasive plants. A greenway/connecting trail along the creek was proposed in the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan.|$|E
5|$|Hansen locates Yusupov, {{who tells}} him that Anna Kamsky, Viktor's daughter, is onboard and must be saved. Yusupov had brought her to Sakhalin to {{blackmail}} Viktor into turning the exocels into biological weapons. Eventually, Viktor and his colleague, Dr. Pavel Bakharev, began to experiment on live human infection, and the Eastern Spirit was on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> the Sakhalin to collect the next batch of human specimens supplied by the Mafia when the exocel outbreak occurred. An exocel then bursts out of Yusupov's chest, killing him. Hansen finds Anna, who tells them they {{must go to the}} radio room and contact her father. They contact the rig, but Bakharev tells Anna that Kamsky is missing and pleads with her not to return. She says no, telling Bakharev she will see him soon. They turn the ship back towards the Sakhalin but because the seas are so rough, they are unable to dock with the platform. As such, they head to the crow's nest and jump from the ship when it collides with the rig. Hansen makes the jump, but Anna falls into the sea.|$|E

5|$|The city sits {{halfway between}} the largest cities in Australia, being 452 {{kilometres}} southwest of Sydney and 456 kilometres northeast of Melbourne with the Sydney–Melbourne railway line passing through.

5|$|A similar episode {{however in}} 1644 had an entirely {{different}} outcome: on 28 September, the Knights of Malta attacked an Ottoman convoy on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> Constantinople to Alexandria, aboard which {{were a number of}} pilgrims bound for Mecca, including the exiled Kızlar Ağa (Chief Black Eunuch) Sünbül Ağa, the kadi of Cairo and the nurse of the future sultan Mehmed IV. During the fight, Sünbül Ağa and most of the important pilgrims were slain, while 350 men and 30 women were taken to be sold as slaves. The Knights loaded their loot on a ship, which then docked at a small harbor on the southern coast of Crete for a few days, where it disembarked a number of sailors and slaves. The Ottomans were enraged at the incident, and the Porte accused the Venetians of deliberate collusion with the Knights, something the Venetians vehemently denied. With the hawkish party being then dominant in the Ottoman court, the incident was seen as a perfect pretext for war with a weakened Venice. Despite a long period of negotiations, which lasted until well into 1645, and against the objections of the Grand Vizier Sultanzade Mehmed Pasha, war was decided upon. An expedition was quickly assembled with over 50,000 troops and reputedly 416 vessels, under Kapudan Pasha Silahdar Yusuf Pasha, the Sultan's son-in-law. The Ottoman armada sailed from the Dardanelles on 30 April, heading towards the harbor of Navarino in the Peloponnese, where it remained for three weeks. The fleet's target was not announced, but the Ottomans, to allay Venetian fears, implied that it would be Malta.|$|E
5|$|In trap-building species, an average-sized larva digs a pit about 2in (5cm) {{deep and}} 3in (7.5cm) wide at the edge. This {{behavior}} {{has also been}} observed in the Vermileonidae (Diptera), whose larvae dig {{the same sort of}} pit to feed on ants. Having marked out the chosen site by a circular groove, the antlion larva starts to crawl backwards, using its abdomen as a plough to shovel up the soil. By the aid of one front leg, it places consecutive heaps of loosened particles upon its head, then with a smart jerk throws each little pile clear of the scene of operations. Proceeding thus, it gradually works <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> the circumference towards the center. As it slowly moves round and round, the pit gradually gets deeper and deeper, until the slope angle reaches the critical angle of repose (that is, the steepest angle the sand can maintain, where it {{is on the verge of}} collapse from slight disturbance). When the pit is completed, the larva settles down at the bottom, buried in the soil with only the jaws projecting above the surface, often in a wide-opened position on either side of the very tip of the cone. The steep-sloped trap that guides prey into the larva's mouth while avoiding crater avalanches is one of the simplest and most efficient traps in the animal kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the advance}} of the Red Army through Belgrade and north into the {{formerly}} Hungarian-occupied Yugoslav region of Baranja made holding {{the line of the}} Danube critical for the Germans. In early November the Soviet troops established a bridgehead over the Danube from Apatin (in modern-day Serbia). From 9 November onward, the division was committed in several stages to the Eastern Front, starting with the reconnaissance battalion which went into action at Dárda west of the Apatin bridgehead on 10 November. They were followed by a grouping of three battalions (I/27, II/28 and II/28), an artillery battalion (III/AR 13) and pioneer support. Known as Kampfgruppe Hanke after their commander Hans Hanke, they moved from the Brčko bridgehead and joined a blocking position at Pélmonostor on 14 November south-west of a second Soviet bridgehead that had been established at Batina (in modern-day Croatia). As a result, the last Muslim SS troops left Bosnia. Within a week they were joined by the reconnaissance battalion, which had acquitted itself well in fighting west of Apatin. By 20 November, the Red Army was across the Danube in force at Batina. The following day Kampfgruppe Hanke was driven out of its positions, when the remaining 200 troops withdrew. By 25 November the rest of the division was on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> the Zagreb area. The remnants of Kampfgruppe Hanke were placed under command of Reichsgrenadier Division Hoch und Deutschmeister, withdrawing as far as Siklós in southern Hungary by 29 November.|$|E
