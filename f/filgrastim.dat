25|$|<b>Filgrastim</b> is {{typically}} dosed in the 10 microgram/kg level for 4–5 days during the harvesting of stem cells. The documented {{adverse effects of}} <b>filgrastim</b> include splenic rupture (indicated by left upper abdominal or shoulder pain, risk 1 in 40000), Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), alveolar hemorrage, and allergic reactions (usually expressed in first 30 minutes, risk 1 in 300). In addition, platelet and hemoglobin levels dip post-procedure, not returning to normal until one month.|$|E
25|$|The {{risks of}} a {{complication}} depend on patient characteristics, {{health care providers}} and the apheresis procedure, and the colony-stimulating factor used (G-CSF). G-CSF drugs include <b>filgrastim</b> (Neupogen, Neulasta), and lenograstim (Graslopin).|$|E
25|$|Anemia and thrombocytopenia, {{when they}} occur, are {{improved}} with blood transfusion. Neutropenia (a decrease of the neutrophil granulocyte count below 0.5 x 109/litre) {{can be improved}} with synthetic G-CSF (granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, e.g., <b>filgrastim,</b> lenograstim).|$|E
25|$|<b>Filgrastim</b> or pegfilgrastim {{help with}} {{white blood cell}} counts and {{neutrophil}} counts. Blood transfusions and epoetin alfa help with anemia. Computational analysis on panel of Osteosarcoma cell lines identified new shared and specific therapeutic targets(proteomic and genetic) in Osteosarcoma phenotypes showed increased role of tumor microenvironment.|$|E
25|$|A study {{involving}} 2408 donors (18–60 years) {{indicated that}} bone pain (primarily back and hips) {{as a result}} of <b>filgrastim</b> treatment is observed in 80 percent of donors by day 4 post-injection. This pain responded to acetaminophen or ibuprofen in 65 percent of donors and was characterized as mild to moderate in 80 percent of donors and severe in 10 percent. Bone pain receded post-donation to 26 percent of patients 2 days post-donation, 6 percent of patients one week post-donation, and <2 percent 1 year post-donation. Donation is not recommended for those with a history of back pain. Other symptoms observed in more than 40 percent of donors include myalgia, headache, fatigue, and insomnia. These symptoms all returned to baseline 1 month post-donation, except for some cases of persistent fatigue in 3 percent of donors.|$|E
2500|$|People {{with low}} {{neutrophil}} counts {{may be given}} <b>filgrastim</b> or a similar hormone to stimulate production of white blood cells. [...] However, a 1999 study indicates that routine administration of this expensive injected drug has no practical value for HCL patients after cladribine administration. [...] In this study, patients who received <b>filgrastim</b> were {{just as likely to}} experience a high fever and to be admitted to the hospital as those who did not, even though the drug artificially inflated their white blood cell counts. [...] This study leaves open the possibility that <b>filgrastim</b> may still be appropriate for patients who have symptoms of infection, or at times other than shortly after cladribine treatment.|$|E

Amgen Puerto Rico received FDA approval for bulk manufacturing facilities for [...] Nepogen (<b>Filgrastim),</b> [...] Neulasta (pegfilgrastim), Aranesp and [...] Epogen. Amgen is also adding manufacturing capacity in Juncos to produce Denosumab.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{drawback}} of carboplatin is its myelosuppressive effect. This {{causes the}} blood cell and platelet output of bone marrow {{in the body}} to decrease quite dramatically, sometimes as low as 10% of its usual production levels. [...] The nadir of this myelosuppression usually occurs 21–28 days after the first treatment, after which the blood cell and platelet levels in the blood begin to stabilize, often coming close to its pre-carboplatin levels. This decrease in white blood cells (neutropenia) can cause complications, and is sometimes treated with drugs like <b>filgrastim.</b> The most notable complication of neutropenia is increased probability of infection by opportunistic organisms, which necessitates hospital readmission and treatment with antibiotics.|$|E
