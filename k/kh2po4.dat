Short stature, leaf spots, edge necrosis, and red or yellow coloration were the main symptoms of poor nutrition in shoot cultures of 10 diverse pear genotypes from six species. A surface response experimental design was used to model the optimal factor and factor levels for responses that included overall quality, leaf character, shoot multiplication, and shoot height.

It has been widely used in psychiatry disorders for four decades, with selective anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, myorelaxant and hypnotic actions. It acts on the central neural system as an inhibitor of the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). The biotransformation from solid into absorbable form depends on its dissolution in organic liquids; therefore, dissolution tests became an essential parameter to determine the properties of pharmaceutical formulations in order to predict their quality. The quality of pharmaceutical formulations is important in financial and ethical terms because it is directly associated with the patient’s health. Thus, there is a real need for the development of dissolution tests able to predict in vivo physiological behavior. The present study is focused on minimizing limitations and developing a simple, precise, accurate and economic method for estimation of Bromazepam in tablet dosage forms. Dissolution test is a standardized method for measuring the rate of drug release from a dosage form. For dissolution medium 0. 1 M HCl was chosen, in volume of 500 ml, at 37 ºC, performed on ERWEKA DT 700, apparatus 2 (paddle), with 75 rpm for 45 minutes. An analytical method for Dissolution by using High Performance Liquid Chromatography technique was validated for content of Bromazepam and the validation was carried out on Shimadzu Nexera HPLC system. To optimize chromatographic parameters several mobile phase compositions were tested. A satisfactory separation, good peak symmetry and optimal retention time was obtained with mobile phase consisting a mixture of methanol, acetonitrile and potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (<b>KH₂PO₄)</b> (pH 7. 0; 11. 33 g/l <b>KH₂PO₄)</b> in ratio of 45 : 5 : 50 (v/v/v) that was set at flow rate of 1. 0 ml/min was found to be optimum and further optimized by adjusting pH 7. 0 by adding KOH 0. 5 M. A LiChrospher RP Select B column (125 × 4. 0 mm, 5 μm) is used as stationary phase with temperature of column oven, 50 ºC. The proposed method is simple, rapid, accurate, precise, and specific in relation to interference of excipients.

Soil incubation was conducted with a sandy soil from South Australia to assess the effect of acidification and increased ionic strength on bacterial abundance and community composition and on elemental S oxidation during a 14 -week incubation at 25 °C and 70 % field capacity. Prior to incubation, the soil was treated with HNO₃ to bring the pH to 6. 7 – 4. 4 or with <b>KH₂PO₄</b> to increase the ionic strength by 0 – 0. 7 M. Elemental S was applied at 200 mg kg⁻¹ air-dried soil. Acidification or increased ionic strength had no or little effect on elemental S oxidation but decreased the abundances of 16 S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rRNA) and soxB genes and changed the bacterial community composition. A second experiment with two other soils also showed that acidification did not, or only slightly, decreased elemental S oxidation, even though acidification strongly reduced 16 S rRNA and soxB gene abundances in one of the soils. This study suggests that shifts in bacterial population brought about by temporary changes in pH and ionic strength, as may occur around fertiliser granules, have no or little effect on elemental S oxidation, indicating that the S-oxidising bacterial community in these agricultural soils contains functionally redundant taxa, which responded to changing conditions.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The {{mechanism}} of phosphate adsorption by clay minerals {{was reported by}} Stout. He showed {{that the loss of}} water of kaolinite in the presence of KC 1, K₂SO₄ or <b>KH₂PO₄</b> was due to an exchange reaction between anion and hydroxyl groups from clay minerals. Also, Kelly and Midgley reported that the increase in pH of a colloidal system caused by phosphate fixation is taken as evidence for the exchange of phosphate ions with hydroxyl ions. Thomas found that the amount of sulfate which is held by an acid red soil increased with time and later Chao, Harward and Fang reported the soil constituents and properties on the adsorption of sulfate ions. A mechanism for sulfate adsorption by soil was proposed by Chang and Thomas. They reported that the adsorption of sulfate was due to the exchange reaction with hydroxyl ions on the soil. An attempt was made to tritiate the soils and clay minerals. It is believed that if the hydrogen of the hydroxyl ions in the soil or clay minerals can be labeled with tritium, then the exchange reaction between hydroxyl ions of soils or clay-minerals and anion may be measured directly from the tritium activity in the solution phase. The radioactivity in aqueous solutions was measured with a Packard Tri-Carb Liquid Scintillation Counter. Tritium counts were obtained at high voltage tap 7 and the amount of tritium released frorn one gram of tritiated soil after shaking with salt solutions of varying concentration is reported. In order to determine the nature of tritium in soil after an exchange reaction, aliquots of tritiated Aiken soil were heated separately at various temperatures (110 - 800 °C) for one hour. The tritium activity which remained in the soil sample could be released by shaking the soil either with water or with salt solutions. This proved definitely the labeling of tritium in the OH group of soil-clay minerals. By the equilibration procedure and using double isotope technique the amount of sulfate or chloride adsorbed by the soil and tritium released was directly determined in the single sample. Results from radio salt showed that the tritium release was unchanged, but a positive adsorption for sulfate for both tritiated Aiken and Willamette soils was observed. The magnitude of sulfate adsorption increased with the increase of sulfate concentration. With a more concentrated solution, it did not induce an additional OH³ release of tritiated soils. Hence, the {{mechanism of}} exchange of sulfate adsorption and hydroxyl group in soil clay mineral as theorized by Chang and Thomas cannot be applied here. When the tritium activity is high in the form of hygroscopic or combined water, then the tritium activity in the hydroxyl ion released by an exchange with the adsorbed anion may not be large enough to be detected. In the chromatographic procedure, all hygroscopic and combined tritiated water was completely removed before the addition of 0. 2 N salt solution. For this purpose water was percolated through the column and two mls increments of the effluent solution were colIected, The tritium activity in each increment was determined. In general, 30 to 35 mls of water were required for the column to reach a steady state. At this time, the salt solution was added and tritium release was measured. Results from chromatographic method using 0. 2 N <b>KH₂PO₄,</b> K₂SO₄ or KC 1 solutions did not support the concept of exchange of hydroxyl ions from clay minerals and anion...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Red raspberry, Rubus idaeus L., is a {{valuable}} crop for the U. S. Pacific Northwest and clonal propagation is required to produce disease-free plants and for germplasm preservation. One challenge of red raspberry micropropagation is the wide variation in growth response among the cultivars. The studies described in this dissertation were designed to provide {{more information on the}} mineral nutrient requirements of in vitro cultures. Mineral nutrient studies using response surface methodology (RSM) were designed to determine which mineral nutrients significantly improved the growth and development of shoot cultures. Mineral nutrients of Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium were used as factors: NH₄NO₃, KNO₃, mesos (CaCl₂, MgSO₄ and <b>KH₂PO₄),</b> minor nutrients (B, Cu, Mn, Mo, and Zn) and Iron. Models indicated that shoot growth and proliferation were significantly influenced by mesos and nitrogen. The effects varied by cultivar for some characteristics, but all cultivars had improved growth or appearance on some experimental treatments when compared to MS medium. Increased mesos was the most significant factor associated with plant quality, multiplication and shoot length in all cultivars. Individual mesos components were optimized using a 3 -dimensional RSM experimental design. High concentrations of CaCl₂ and <b>KH₂PO₄</b> significantly increased shoot length for most cultivars. All cultivars required significantly higher concentrations (p ≤ 0. 05) of all three mesos components (2. 5 - 3. 0 ×) for improved growth and shoot quality compared to MS medium. Mineral status of the shoots reflected the amount of minerals in the growth medium. A mixture component design was applied to optimizing the nitrogen salts (NH₄NO₃ and KNO₃) on MS medium with 2. 5 × mesos. Eight red raspberry cultivars and one R. odoratus L. were evaluated followed by a screen of three additional species. Increased NO₃⁻ concentration was the most significant factor for improved shoot quality. The effects of the NH₄⁺ and K⁺ mixture and interactions between the components in the mixture and NO₃⁻ affected most cultivars. The standard MS nitrogen level combined with the 2. 5 × mesos concentration was optimal for most cultivars, but three other modified nitrogen levels also improved overall quality, shoot elongation, multiplication for many of the cultivars. Since the largest effects on growth were from increased mesos, plant metabolism was studied using 'Indian Summer' as a model cultivar. Shoots grown on standard MS medium (1. 0 × MS mesos) were compared to shoots grown on 1. 5 × and 2. 5 × MS mesos. After 9 weeks growth, shoots were evaluated for quality factors and metabolic changes. Metabolic changes were determined by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) coupled to liquid chromatography. Metabolic analysis indicated that shoots grown on increased mesos had reduced amino acids (glutamine, arginine histidine, tryptophan and proline) and the secondary metabolites: proanthocyanidin (epi-catechin), quercetin, and ellagic acid compared to those on standard MS. This study determined changes in the growth medium mineral content required to greatly improve the growth of 21 red raspberry cultivars and several Rubus species. Increasing the mesos concentration was the most important mineral factor for improved growth response. Four combinations of nitrogen compounds were effective for improving growth of most cultivars. The production of red raspberries by micropropagation is a multimillion dollar business and these improvements would increase productivity that could positively impact that industry...|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier and can be found at: [URL] vitro propagation is important for rapid multiplication {{of a wide range of}} nursery crops, including red raspberries. The genetic variation of the many red raspberry cultivars makes it difficult to use one growth medium for all. Although some cultivars grow well on Murashige and Skoog (1962) medium (MS), others display stunting, hyperhydricity, discoloration, callus, leaf spots, or necrosis. This study used response surface methodology (RSM) to determine the effects of MS mineral salts on red raspberry growth and which of these mineral salts are critical for improving growth. In vitro growth of five red raspberry cultivars was determined by varying five factors that included NH₄NO₃, KNO₃, mesos salts (CaCl₂, <b>KH₂PO₄</b> and MgSO₄), minor elements (Zn–Mn–Cu–Co–Mo–B–I), and EDTA-chelated iron. The effects of these five factors on plant quality, multiplication, shoot length, leaf size, leaf area, leaf color, callus and leaf spots were determined. The effects varied by cultivar for some characteristics, but all cultivars had improved growth or appearance on some experimental treatments when compared to MS medium. Increased mesos was the most significant factor associated with plant quality, multiplication and shoot length in all cultivars. Increasing iron above MS levels decreased quality in all cultivars except ‘Willamette’. Decreased KNO₃ with increased mesos and low iron were required to improve shoot multiplication. Increased NH₄NO₃ resulted in greater shoot elongation only in ‘Willamette’.

Pyrus communis ‘Old Home × Farmingdale 87,’ ‘Horner 51,’ and ‘Winter Nelis’; Pyrus dimorphophylla; and Pyrus ussuriensis ‘Hang Pa Li’ shoot cultures were grown on 43 computer-designed treatments to represent the design space of all possible treatment combinations. Analysis of shoot response to these treatments identified the factors that both contributed to physiological disorders and remedied them. Undesirable callus formation was common for pear shoots cultured on standard medium and decreased on formulations with increased NH₄NO₃, Fe, and mesos (CaCl₂, <b>KH₂PO₄,</b> and MgSO₄) for most genotypes. Shoot tip necrosis varied with the genotype, but low mesos or low nitrogen concentrations contributed to the necrosis. Hyperhydricity was more prominent with low mesos or low NH₄NO₃. Hooked and upwardly curled new leaves were seen in most genotypes and resulted from use of low mesos in P. communis and low nitrogen for ‘Hang Pa Li’ and P. dimorphophylla.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The {{rate of the}} C¹⁴ 0 ₂ {{release from}} glucose, {{specifically}} labeled with C¹⁴ at 1, 2, 3 + 4, and positions, was used to study the relative participation of pathways of glucose catabolism in red beet slices. Evidence was obtained which indicated that in mature red beets glucose was catabolized mainly via glycolysis-tricarboxylic acid cycle (EMP-TCAC). Approximately 15 - 22 {{percent of the total}} glucose catabolized in fresh slices appeared to be mediated via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Older beet roots were found to have more PPP activity than young beet root slices. When red beet slices were washed in either demineralized distilled water or 0. 01 M <b>KH₂PO₄</b> solution by shaking in a gyratory shaker, the relative participation of the PPP increased with the duration of washing. Increase in the relative participation of the PPP was more in the slices washed in <b>KH₂PO₄</b> solution than in water alone. However, changes in the relative participation of pathways were less marked with red beet slices than with other storage tissues as reported by other workers, The TCAC was active in both fresh and washed beet slices. C¹⁴ release from specifically labeled glucose by fresh beet slices was very strongly inhibited by 0. 05 M malonate, whereas much less inhibition was found inwashed slices. This strongly suggests TCAC participation in the fresh slices. Enzyme assays with crude extracts prepared from red beet slices indicated that the following enzyme activity changes occurred during a 24 -hour washing period. Glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase (TPN) slightly increased in activity; TPN reduction and malic dehydrogenase (TPN) activities slightly decreased; TPNH oxidizing power increased significantly; 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity increased 3 - 5 fold. The increase in TPNH oxidizing power {{may play a role in}} increasing the relative participation of PPP, but the most marked increase was found in 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity and the rate of gluconate utilization. Washing periods longer than two days caused a marked decrease in glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and triose phosphate dehydrogenase activities. Experiments with glucose specifically labeled with H³ indicated that the TPNH produced by the PPP was utilized for biosynthetic purposes rather than as a respiratory substrate. Metabolic changes of slices aged under moist conditions in petri dishes were also examined. The rate of oxygen uptake increased 3 - 5 times in 20 - 24 hours. O₂ uptake by fresh slices was inhibited 60 - 70 percent by 8 x 10 ⁻⁵M HCN. The sensitivity of respiration to HCN decreased rather rapidly during aging and resulted in a cyanide stimulation (about 30 percent) of respiration in about 10 - 12 hours. After about 36 hours of aging, cyanide sensitivity began to reappear. The rates of C¹⁴ release from specifically labeled glucose by fresh and aged red beet slices showed that both the PPP and the EMPTCAC were stimulated by aging. Preferential increase in PPP participation was indicated to be very small, if any. Release of C¹⁴ O₂ from specifically labeled acetate, succinate, aspartate and glutonate showed TCAC activity in both fresh and aged slices. Glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase activity doubled and 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity increased by about 300 - 400 percent as a result of aging for 36 hours, The rate of gluconate utilization increased 10 - 20 times by aging over that of fresh slices. The rate of uptake and utilization of organic acids, amino acids and glucose increased several fold due to 24 -hours of aging. Biosynthetic activities such as protein synthesis of these tissues were also indicated to be increased during aging. From these studies, it does not seem justifiable to explain age induced respiration as being due to a release of inhibition on TCAO activity or as preferential increase in PPP activity, but it seems to be a stimulation of the activity of the total metabolic machinery probably caused by removal of a metabolic block which is still not understood...|$|E

Pythium ultimum Trow., Pythium debaryanum Hess., and Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn. {{were found to}} be the important pathogenic fungi causing the disease. Trichoderma viride, Penicillium spp. Streptomyces spp. and certain isolates of bacteria, all saprophytic organisms associated with diseased beet seedlings, beet rhizospheres and infested soil, were strongly antagonistic toward Pythium ultimum in agar culture and were selected for control tests in soil under greenhouse conditions. Infesting beet seeds with spores of Trichoderma or Penicillium, afforded good protection of seedlings from pre-emergence damping-off but did not prevent damping-off of older seedlings in infested field soil. Beet seedlings suffered less pre-emergence damping-off in soil amended with K₂HPO₄ and urea; cornmeal, sucrose and casein, on the other hand, increased incidence of the disease. Simultaneous infestation of sterilized greenhouse soil with Pythium and Trichoderma or Pythium and Penicillium one week before seeding resulted in good control of damping-off. The antagonists were less effective when mixed with sterilized soil in which Pythium had been pre-established, or when mixed with non-sterilized greenhouse soil simultaneously with the pathogen. The best results again were obtained in soil amended with <b>KH₂PO₄</b> and urea. In sterilized soil, bacterial antagonists had no effect on damping-off. Streptomyces spp. were inconsistent in controlling the disease. Treatment of soil with fungicides markedly affected the micro-flora in infested soil, and recolonization by certain species varied with different chemicals. Following treatment with 50, 100, or 200 lbs. Lanstan, or with 50 lbs. Ceresan per acre, Pythium initially disappeared from the soil but recolonized rapidly. Greater concentrations of Ceresan either completely suppressed Pythium or resulted in very slow recolonization by the pathogen. In soil treated with Dithane, Maneb, or Bayer 47531, both Pythium and Trichoderma decreased progressively during the period of the test.

Development of new cultivars is continuous, with emphasis on better nut quality, high yield and disease resistance. Hazelnuts are highly heterozygous, and clonally propagated. Traditional propagation methods in hazelnut are not rapid enough to provide the required nursery stock for newly released hazelnut cultivars, but micropropagation can provide rapid production of hazelnut planting stock. Several growth media are available for specific cultivars, but many are not suitable for the wide range of germplasm used in new cultivars. Micropropagation of hazelnuts remains challenging due to the various responses of diverse genotypes to in vitro growth. Several studies incrimentally improved the growth medium, but determining exact nutrient requirements was difficult. The aim of this study was to determine which statistical methods would make the growth medium optimization process more practical and to develop an optimal micropropagation medium for diverse hazelnuts by testing salts and ions as factors within the experimental design. In addition an SSR fingerprinting set suitable for a diverse group of hazelnuts was developed. The first study was designed to test the effect of salts on three hazelnut genotypes and compare two methods of data analysis. Driver and Kuniyuki Walnut medium (DKW) macro-salts (NH₄NO₃, Ca(NO₃) ₂∙ 4 H₂O, CaCl₂∙ 2 H₂O, MgSO₄∙ 7 H₂O, <b>KH₂PO₄</b> and K₂SO₄) were varied from 0. 5 × to 3 × DKW concentrations with 42 combinations in a IV-optimal design. Shoot quality, shoot length, multiplication and callus formation were rated and analyzed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and the Chi-Squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) data mining algorithm. Both analyses indicated that NH₄NO₃ was a predominant nutrient factor. RSM results were genotype dependent while CHAID included genotype as a factor in the analysis, allowing development of a common medium rather than several genotype-specific media. Overall, CHAID results were more specific and easier to interpret than RSM graphs. The optimal growth medium for diverse hazelnut genotypes was formulated as: 0. 5 × NH₄NO₃, 3 × <b>KH₂PO₄,</b> 1. 5 × Ca(NO₃) ₂ and and the rest of the macro salts set at 1 × DKW with modified minor nutrients [4 × H₃BO₃, 4 × Na₂MoO₄∙ 2 H₂O, 4 × Zn(NO₃) ₂∙ 6 H₂O, 0. 5 × MnSO₄∙H₂O, 0. 5 × CuSO₄∙ 5 H₂O]. The second study was to determine the effects of ions on tissue culture medium optimization. NH₄⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, SO₄²⁻ and PO₄³⁻ ions were used as factors in a D-optimal design. K⁺ and NO₃⁻ ions were used to bring the pH level to neutral, and as factors in the statistical analysis. The CHAID data mining algorithm was used to analyze shoot growth responses of three hazelnut genotypes. The algorithm trees revealed significant variables and their interactions, and provided exact cut-off amounts for each of the ions for the related growth response by incorporating genotype as an independent factor. The critical cut-off values for good shoot quality, elongation, multiplication and medium callus formation were suggested to be: NO₃⁻ 5 mM and K⁺ < 46 mM. Another step of the research was to develop a reliable and economical fingerprinting set consisting of high core-repeat SSRs (≥ 3) for genotype identification of 102 hazelnut accessions. Identification of trueness-to-type by phenotypic observation is very difficult and labeling mistakes during the several steps of micropropagation can result in costly errors. The use of SSRs for plant identification is preferred over other molecular markers because they are reproducible across laboratories, exhibit co-dominant inheritance, have a large number of alleles per locus and are randomly distributed throughout the genome. Twenty SSRs containing repeat motifs of three or more nucleotides distributed throughout the hazelnut genome were screened on eight genetically diverse cultivars to assess polymorphism, allele size range, and ease of scoring. Six SSRs were discarded after genotyping 96 hazelnut samples, either due to large allele bin widths and/or alleles that do not match the motifs, complicating allele scoring. Fourteen polymorphic, easy-to-score SSRs with non-overlapping alleles were selected and amplified in a single multiplex. The multiplexed set generated the same alleles that were obtained when amplifying each SSR individually in the eight test accessions. SSR primer concentrations were then optimized to generate a clear signal for each locus. This 14 -SSR fingerprinting set was used to genotype 102 hazelnut accessions, and distinguished unique accessions mainly according to parentage and in some cases based on geographic origin. As a result of these studies, salt- and ion-based optimized tissue culture medium formulations were developed for diverse hazelnuts. The importance of salts and ions as factors within the experimental design and analysis was examined, and using salts as factors results in complexity within the design as the effects of ions can not be determined. Although salt optimization studies are still a powerful tool, and are experimentally easier, optimization at the ionic level provided a clearer evaluation of the ion-based growth responses, because the plants take up minerals as ions of the corresponding salts. Data mining (CHAID) was used to make the tissue culture optimization process more practical compared to analysis with the standard ANOVA, regression and RSM. CHAID delineated specific concentrations that were effective and allowed easier analysis of nutrient content for an improved medium. A reliable and cost-effective multiplexed fingerprinting set of 14 SSR markers was developed for confirming identity and paternity in diverse hazelnut cultivars and species and 102 accessions were fingerprinted...|$|E
40|$|Pleurotus ostreatus {{mushroom}} mycelium {{was grown}} in submerged culture with acid extract from peat {{as a basic}} substrate. The proximate chemical composition of the peat extract was determined. The total reducing sugars constituted about 50 % of the total carbohydrate (TCH) concentration. The total nitrogen content was low at about 0. 6 g/L of the pet extract. The total ash was about 4. 5 %, of which 1. 2 % was P₂O₅ and 0. 87 % K₂O. [...] Different concentrations of water-diluted peat extract were tested in shake flask experiments {{in an attempt to}} overcome the effect of growth inhibitors apparently present in non-diluted peat extracts. The best results were obtained with a ratio of one part peat extract diluted with one part water. Several operating variables were studied to optimize the growth of the mycelial biomass of P. ostreatus. The best results produced approximately 5 g/L of dry biomass with a yield of 60 % and an efficiency of 33 %. The results were obtained in 192 hours at an inoculum ratio of 5. 0 % (v/v), and incubation temperature of 28 ± 1 °C, an initial pH of 5. 0 ± 0. 1 and an agitation speed of 150 rpm. The addition of 1. 5 % glucose to the diluted peat extract medium increased the growth to approximately 14 g/L of dry biomass with a yield of 70 % and an efficiency of 45 %, indicating that the diluted peat extract was deficient in carbon. [...] The nutritional requirements of the P. ostreatus mycelium grown in peat extract were studied to enhance the growth of the mycelial biomass. The fungus grew better on hexose sugars (glucose and mannose) than on pentose sugars (xylose and arabinose) and required additional nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium for growth. Growth was also better on organic sources of nitrogen than on ammonium salts of inorganic acids. The addition of 5. 0 g/L yeast extract and 4. 0 g/L <b>KH₂PO₄</b> to the peat extract media produced approximately 7 g/L dry biomass with a yield of 73 % and an efficiency of 46 %. [...] Agitation and aeration were optimized and the dissolved oxygen concentration was monitored in a 2 Liter fermenter to study the growth of the P. ostreatus mycelium biomass in the peat extract. The best results produced approximately 9 g/L of biomass with a yield of 72 % and a productivity of 70 mg/L/hour. These results were obtained in 96 hours at an agitation speed of 200 rpm, an aeration rate of 1. 0 vvm, an inoculum ratio of 5. 0 % (v/v), an incubation temperature of 28 ± 1 °C and a pH of 5. 0 ± 0. 1. Higher agitation speeds and aeration rates produced lower growth and a dispersed mycelial growth form. The morphology of the P. ostreatus growth form was also affected by the pH and the media composition. [...] The chemical composition of the P. ostreatus mycelium biomass was analyzed and compared with that of the fruiting body produced on solid peat to study the nutritional quality of the product. The mycelium contained approximately 40 % crude protein, 8 % ash, which contained K, P, Ca and Mg as major minerals, 36 % TCH, 6 % fiber and 3 % total fat. The protein contained 17 amino acids, including all the essential amino acids, and was high in threonine, lysine, tryptophane, arginine, leucine and phenyalanine, but was deficient in methionine when compared with egg protein. Three essential fatty acids (palmitic, oleic and linoleic acids) were identified in the biomass...|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{for growing}} single crystals from aqueous solution by the slow evaporation method was constructed. Mixed crystals of K₁₋x (NH₄) x H₂PO₄ (KADP) with (NH₄) H₂PO₄ (ADP) fractions of 0. 021 and 0. 12 were successfully grown. Their composition {{was determined by}} means of the x-ray powder diffraction method. This analysis also suggests that those crystals are a mixture of two phases even at room temperature. The details {{of the structure of the}} additional phase could not be determined. [...] The dielectric constant ε of the mixed crystals as well as pure <b>KH₂PO₄</b> (KDP) was measured along the polar axis in the temperature range from 20 K to 300 K. The frequency range of the applied electric field was from 100 Hz to 10 MHz. The data were analyzed {{by means of the}} standard Landau theory of phase transitions with coupling terms reflecting the interaction between the electric and elastic degrees of freedom. The temperature dependence of ε follows a typical Curie-Weiss behavior in the range of approximately 30 K above Tc for all crystals studied. The value of the critical temperature decreases with increasing ammonium ion content in agreement with previously published results. The analysis of the frequency dependence of the dielectric susceptibility clearly indicates the existence of two dispersion processes: resonant and relaxational. The former is attributed to the piezoelectric activity of all the crystals studied. The latter is the result of the response of the permanent dipole moments present in ferroelectric crystals to the applied electric field. In the case of mixed crystals the relaxational dispersion is characterized by a distribution of relaxation times. Its mean relaxation time as well as its width increases with decreasing T. This is a typical behavior for mixed crystals for which the two end members of the solid solution in their pure form undergo ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phase transitions, respectively. This behavior is a result of competing long range interactions. [...] New results for the temperature dependence of the CE/ 66 and CE/ 11 elastic constants of the crystals were obtained by means of the Brillouin spectroscopy. In addition to that the soft acoustic mode behaviour was also studied by means of the piezoelectric resonance method. Both of them gave qualitatively similar results which also correlate very well with the dielectric measurements. All major differences could be explained by assuming an inhomogeneous distribution of the ammonium ions in the KDP matrix. The Brillouin results were also analyzed by means of the Landau theory. It approximates very well the temperature dependence of the CE/ 66 elastic constant in the paraelectric phase region for all crystals studied. The measured values of CE/ 66 below Tc are in general lower than those predicted by the model. The greater the NH₄ content the bigger the discrepancy. [...] Moreover, the analysis of the temperature dependence of the CE/ 66 elastic constant indicates the existence of a new phase in the mixed materials. Its stability region broadens with increasing NH₄ concentration. For the crystal with the highest ammonium concentration studied it coincides with the dielectric plateau region between 70 K and 55 K. At temperatures below the plateau region the K₀. ₈₈(NH₄) ₀. ₁₂H₂PO₄ sample scattered the laser light very strongly. This is most likely caused by defects and sample inhomogeneities but annealing the sample for two hours at 400 K does not result in any significant change...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Corylus avellana L. is {{a global}} {{commodity}} and a valuable crop for the U. S. Pacific Northwest. A tremendous amount of work has been put into the development of healthy disease free, high yielding and tasty hazelnuts for the in-shell and confectionary markets. Clonal propagation is required to provide nursery trees of these improved hazelnut cultivars. The rapid multiplication provided by micropropagation methods {{is an important part}} of meeting the demand. One challenge of hazelnuts micropropagation is the wide variation in growth response among the cultivars. The studies described in this thesis were involved in improving the mineral nutrients in the growth medium and to better determine culture initiation procedures. The first study was designed to determine what mineral nutrients are driving C. avellana in vitro shoot growth using a response surface design. Hazelnut genotypes 'Dorris,' 'Felix,' 'Jefferson', OSU 880. 054, and 'Sacajawea' were used. Driver and Kuniyuki Walnut medium (DKW) mineral nutrients were separated into five factors: NH₄NO₃, Ca(NO₃) ₂, mesos (MgSO₄ and <b>KH₂PO₄),</b> K₂SO₄, and minor nutrients (B, Cu, Mn, Mo, and Zn). The concentrations ranged from 0. 5 x to 2. 0 x the standard DKW concentrations with 33 treatments for use in modeling. Multifactor response surface analysis projected that optimum shoot proliferation was greatly influenced by the NH₄NO₃ to Ca(NO₃) ₂ ratios, mesos, and minors. These factors were important to overall quality and shoot length for all genotypes. Improved shoot quality was observed with increased Ca(NO₃) ₂, mesos, and minors for most of the cultivars tested. For 'Sacajawea' only the mesos components significantly improved shoot quality. Lower Ca(NO₃) ₂ improved shoot multiplication while higher amounts increased shoot length for most cultivars. New media formulations will require higher Ca(NO₃) ₂, mesos and minors as well as changes in the NH₄NO₃ to Ca(NO₃) ₂ ratios. The second study determined the effects of individual minor-mineral nutrients including nickel on hazelnut shoot growth. Three hazelnut cultivars 'Dorris,' 'Jefferson,' and 'Sacajawea' were used. Six factors at 0. 5 x to 4. 0 x DKW concentrations, H₃BO₃, CuSO₄, MnSO₄, Na₂MoO₄, Zn(NO₃) ₂, and NiSO₄, were tested in a response surface design with 39 treatment combinations. Ni, not present in DKW, ranged from 0 to 6 µM. Higher concentrations (4 x) of B, Mo, and Zn increased overall shoot quality, length and multiplication. There were many significant interactions. High B concentrations significantly improved shoot quality for 'Jefferson'; shoot quality, length and number for 'Dorris'; and shoot length and number for 'Sacajawea'. Increased Mo improved some responses for each cultivar, and it also interacted with Cu and Zn. Interactions of Ni with other minor nutrients resulted in improved shoot quality and length in 'Sacajawea. ' Ni interactions were significant for the other cultivars as well, altered the requirements for other nutrients, but did not necessarily improve the overall shoot response. Improved growth and shoot quality in 'Dorris' and 'Jefferson' required increased amounts of B, Mo, and Zn; 'Sacajawea' required increased B, Cu, Zn, and Ni. The diverse responses of these cultivars further confirmed that nutrient uptake or utilization was genotype dependent. Hazelnuts are generally difficult to initiate into culture due to internal microbial contaminants and a general lack of viability of the explants. The third study was designed to determine the effect of nodal position and collection techniques on the viability and contamination of shoot explants. Explants were collected from scion wood grafted onto seedling rootstocks and grown in the greenhouse. Single-node explants were collected from different locations on the scion wood. After surface sterilization, explants were first held in a liquid contaminant-detection medium for one week and the effect on explant viability was evaluated. Node position influenced the number of viable contaminant-free explants. Bacterial contamination increased with the distance from the shoot tip. The use of liquid detection medium as a part of the initiation procedure did not affect viability. Bacteria sampled from surface sterilized explants were identified as Brevundimonas vesicularis, Brevundimonas sp., and two Pseudomonas sp., by 16 S ribosomal DNA sequences and API® 20 CHB tests. The best procedure for collecting axenic, viable hazelnut explants was to collect from the first three nodes of actively-growing greenhouse plants and use detection medium to identify contaminant-free tissue. As a result of these studies several suggested growth media formulations are now available for use that may produce improved hazelnut shoot quality, multiplication and elongation for a wide range of C. avellana genotypes. Two base macro nutrient formulations, Hazelnut A and B, are likely to be suitable for many genotypes. Three micronutrient formulations provide options for growth of difficult genotypes with and without Ni. Continued optimization and testing of mesos and N components are needed for final medium formulations...|$|E
