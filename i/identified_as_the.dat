5|$|A 1996 E. Coli {{outbreak}} {{at one of}} Burger King's largest beef providers, Hudson Foods, gave Tyson Foods one of {{its largest}} business coups. Hudson {{was one of the}} largest poultry providers in the United States and one of Tyson's largest competitors when they moved into beef processing at the behest of Burger King. Once it had secured a contract with Burger King, Hudson opened a beef processing plant in Nebraska. When the plant was <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> source of an E. Coli breakout in 1996, Burger King abandoned the company as a supplier.|$|E

5|$|Adult {{males and}} juveniles are quite {{different}} in appearance to the female. They are smaller in size, being about one sixth {{the size of an}} adult female. Juveniles have a brown carapace, with a predominantly white abdomen which has a series of red-orange diamonds running along the dorsal region bordered on either side by irregular black lines. Males retain this coloration into adulthood. Due to its much smaller size, Urquhart (1886) believed the male to be a separate species and named it Theridion melanozantha. This was not rectified until 1933 when it was correctly <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> male Latrodectus katipo.|$|E
5|$|Although Jean-Jacques Dessalines, {{a pivotal}} {{figure in the}} Haitian Revolution, is barely {{mentioned}} in the novel, the one page dedicated to him emphasizes his connection to African gods while neglecting to mention any of his other features that made him an effective leader. While Dessaline's belief in African gods is highlighted, Henri Christophe's abandonment of the religion is stressed, being <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> reason for his downfall.|$|E
5|$|Although {{both sides}} claimed victory, neither {{achieved}} all their objectives; the JNA garrison evacuated the Logorište barracks, but Croatian defences elsewhere held.

While the JNA removed some weapons and equipment stored in the Logorište barracks, the remaining supplies were removed by the ZNG over a one-week period after the battle.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the city}} of Mahabalipuram was {{constructed}} by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I in the 7th century AD, {{there is evidence that}} a small port might have functioned at the site even earlier. Megalithic burial urns dating to the very dawn of the Christian era have been discovered near Mahabalipuram. The Sangam age poem Perumpāṇāṟṟuppaṭai describes a port called Nirppeyyaru which some scholars identify with the present-day Mahabalipuram. Sadras near Mahabalipuram has been <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> site of the port of Sopatma mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} Whitewater River and local washes were {{considered}} {{the primary source}} of these sands, which would have been transported to the Algodones area by longshore drift. This would imply a minimum age of 160,000 years. Later the Colorado River was <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> main source of these sediments, potentially with some contribution from local drainages. At prevailing winds, most of the sediments from the Colorado would have been transported to the Cerro Prieto area and possibly carried by wind to the Gran Desierto de Altar.|$|E

It was not until 31 January 1862 that Alvan Graham Clark observed a previously unseen star close to Sirius, later <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> predicted companion. Walter Adams announced in 1915 that he had found the spectrum of Sirius B to be similar to that of Sirius.|$|E

An outer sphere, inhabited by angels, appeared in some accounts.|$|E
5|$|For years, Europeans in Africa {{had heard}} of an animal that they came to call the 'African unicorn'. In his travelogue of {{exploring}} the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley mentioned a kind of donkey that the natives called the atti, which scholars later <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> okapi. Explorers may have seen the fleeting view of the striped backside as the animal fled through the bushes, leading to speculation that the okapi {{was some sort of}} rainforest zebra.|$|E
