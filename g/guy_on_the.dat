25|$|Chuck's {{philosophy}} was to convince every <b>guy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team that his role was important. If {{you came in}} {{as a free agent}} and were just a gunner on the punt team or the third safety, you were doing something the team needed to win...It was his way of emphasizing that no one is irreplaceable. You have to coach everybody the same way. If Joe Greene goes out, Steve Furness goes in and we're not going to change anything. Chuck never panicked when someone got hurt or held out. We can still function. That made a big impression on me.|$|E

Described as an [...] "idiot savant", he is characterized as a conspiracy theorist who experiences paranoia about everything from dentists to toothpaste companies. He frequently communicates through [...] "head-scratching non sequiturs", leading the characters to perceive him as [...] "operat on a whole other level... and sometimes on a whole other planet". Vieluf said the character was pitched as [...] "the only <b>guy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show" [...] and [...] "the luckiest guy in the world".|$|E
500|$|A Harvard coach remembered Lin in his {{freshman}} season as [...] "the [...] weakest <b>guy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team", {{but in his}} sophomore season (2007–08), Lin averaged 12.6 points and {{was named to the}} All-Ivy League Second Team. By his junior year during the 2008–09 season, he was the only NCAA Division I men's basketball player who ranked in the top ten in his conference for scoring (17.8), rebounding (5.5), assists (4.3), steals (2.4), blocked shots (0.6), field goal percentage (0.502), free throw percentage (0.744), and three-point shot percentage (0.400), and was a consensus selection for the All-Ivy League First Team. He made 27points, 8assists, and 6rebounds in an 82–70 win over the 17th-ranked Boston College Eagles, three days after the Eagles defeated No. 1 North Carolina.|$|E
500|$|He {{began the}} 1981 season with five {{consecutive}} 100-yard games, including a 253-yard effort. [...] Woolfolk's best {{game as a}} Wolverine was the October 10, 1981 contest against Michigan State. The Wolverines beat the Spartans, 38-20, and Woolfolk rushed for 253 yards in 39 carries. After the game, Coach Bo Schembechler said: [...] "I wondered what a kid like that would do if he ran {{as much as the}} <b>guy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> West Coast (Marcus Allen). I didn't plan on this, but he proved he can do it. Butch is going to be our all-time leading ground gainer. There isn't any way they're going to stop him now. And so be it." [...] His 1981 rushing performance against the Spartans still stands as the fifth best single-game performance by a Wolverine running back.|$|E

500|$|Series creator Matthew Weiner {{called the}} {{decision}} to write off Lane Pryce [...] "a terrible thing {{to have to deal}} with." [...] He added, [...] "You {{want to make sure that}} it's worth it, that they're going out with a bang and you're not sacrificing someone who's a great actor and a great musician in the orchestra. But also I feel like there have to be stakes. This year was filled with foreboding of violence and death, and the connection of that early summer between the riots, which resulted in death, police killing innocent people, and the Richard Speck murders and the <b>guy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Texas tower [...] The randomness and the nihilism that was born from that was something that permeated the story. Lane's story I thought was about someone who has undervalued themselves and that was his only way out, he thought." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews for {{the episode}} were {{generally}} favorable. A 2008 {{review of the}} episode by Ahsan Haque of IGN was positive, calling the storyline involving Stewie [...] "elaborate [...] creative." [...] He gave the episode a perfect score of ten, calling {{it one of the}} most [...] "memorable" [...] episodes in the entire series. Haque went on to note that [...] "the tightly woven and hilarious storyline, combined with a constant barrage of cleverly inserted random jokes, and some truly unique imagery help make this episode one of the finest in the series. This is Family Guy at its best, and definitely sets a very high bar for animated comedy." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic rated the episode a 70 out of 100, making it the highest-rated episode of Family <b>Guy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site. Pierson described the episode as [...] "A really fun twenty two minutes of television. There are so many jokes to enjoy and they are more focussed than the pilot," [...] in particular praising the Fast Animals, Slow Children sequence.|$|E
500|$|... "Subway" [...] {{was shot}} by Alex Zakrzewski, the series' regular {{director}} of photography. The episode was staged so that Pembleton is initially keeping his distance from Lange, but gradually moves closer and closer as they begin to bond, {{and by the end}} is sitting next to him and holding his hand. Accordingly, the initial scenes included wider shots with Braugher and D'Onofrio on the outer edges of the frame, but later scenes included more close-ups of the two sitting together. Although Homicide: Life on the Street typically employs a number of back-and-forth whip pan-style cuts, Fleder asked that the style be modified for this episode. In earlier scenes, Fleder asked for wider long shots {{to create a sense of}} setting within the subway station, and as the episode progressed and the story became more intense, he then allowed more close-ups and whip pans. This led to disagreements on the set between Fleder and Zakrzewski, who felt Fleder was trying to being too disruptive and difficult. Fleder said of his behavior, [...] "I have to admit, I'm not the most charming <b>guy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set. I'm just not. When I'm on the set, I'm very focused and my humor goes away and I become not so charming." [...] After the episode was complete, Fleder said that he and Zakrzewski settled their differences and were both happy with the final result.|$|E

500|$|On December 27, {{after an}} injury to guard Iman Shumpert, the New York Knicks claimed Lin off of waivers to be a backup behind Toney Douglas and Mike Bibby. Recently signed guard Baron Davis had also been injured, and was weeks away {{from being able to}} play. Because of the lockout, coaches had had little {{opportunity}} to see Lin's play, and placed him fourth on the point guard depth chart. Lin stated that he was [...] "competing for a backup spot", and people saw him [...] "as the 12th to 15th <b>guy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roster. It's a numbers game," [...] yet he continued to arrive first at practice, and leave last, intensely studying game film, and working with coaches to improve his footwork and judgment. He made his season debut with the Knicks on the road against the Warriors, where he was warmly cheered in his return to Oracle Arena. In January, Lin was assigned to the Erie BayHawks of the D-League, and on January 20, he scored a triple-double with 28 points, 11 rebounds, and 12 assists in the BayHawks' 122–113 victory over the Maine Red Claws. Three days later, Lin was recalled by the Knicks, but was so fearful of being cut again that he asked a chaplain at a pregame prayer service to pray for him. If he were to be released again, Lin would consider playing in Europe, returning to the D-League, or taking a non-basketball job.|$|E

In the Anime Awards 2006 from About.com, Edward won in the category [...] "Best Lead Character – Male". He was also seventh in IGN's 2009 Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time with writer Chris Mackenzie saying, [...] " [...] and his kid brother Al make one of the best action-comedy teams in recent memory". In 2014, IGN ranked him as the eighth greatest anime character of all time, saying that [...] "In Edward we had a character who was truly multidimensional. He could be comedic and pull off wild takes and sight gags. He could be placed in the most tragic circumstances and portray the deepest kind of sadness. He could be a complete badass, but he could also be the nicest <b>guy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> planet." [...] Several pieces of merchandise have been released in Edward's likeness, including plush toys, action figures, and key-chains. Vic Mignogna, who performs the voice of Edward in the English dub, was the winner in American Anime Awards in the category [...] "Best Actor" [...] for voicing Edward. In a poll by Anime News Network, he was voted as the 5th best [...] "guy".|$|E
500|$|The Cosby Show {{is famous}} for rarely {{discussing}} political or controversial topics; it spends significantly more time openly addressing Clair's role as [...] "a woman who 'has it all'", maintaining a successful career while raising a family, than it does the race of its characters. The series seldom shies away from discussing gender equality. Despite never referring to herself as feminist within the show, Clair proudly embodies several feminist themes and beliefs, remaining, according to The Daily Dots Nico Lang, [...] "an outspoken advocate for equality in her household, fighting sexism while setting an example for her daughters." [...] From the sitcom's earliest stages, Cosby had always intended for Clair to reflect the ever-changing work and family dynamic, explaining, [...] "If this was 1964 ... my wife could do the cooking and I could be the <b>guy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa who just says, ‘Let your mother handle this.’ But today {{a lot of things}} have changed and I want the show to reflect those changes." [...] According to Rotten Tomatoes' Alex Vo, Clair represents [...] "the rapidly changing gender and household roles from the 1980s and onward." [...] MeTV agreed that Clair is [...] "the '80s response to the '50s housewife." [...] Although feminism was hardly a new concept to sitcoms by the time The Cosby Show premiered, feminist television characters remained scare during the early 1980s. The Huffington Posts Dr. Mlsee Harris observed that, during this time, [...] "The stereotypical role of the black woman on television ... had been that of a financially struggling, single woman with dysfunctional relationships, trying to get her life together with no distinct direction", stereotypes Clair worked to defy. Sarah Galo of Mic observed that Clair demonstrates that motherhood and having a career are not [...] "separate entities".|$|E
