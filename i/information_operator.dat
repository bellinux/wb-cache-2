For instance, the New York City <b>information</b> <b>operator</b> was 212-131. If the customer knew the number, and the point was direct-dialable, the operator would dial the call. If the distant city did not have dialable numbers, the operator would dial the code for the inward operator serving the called party, and ask her to ring the number.|$|E

50|$|The {{blue box}} {{consisted}} {{of a set of}} audio oscillators, a telephone keypad, an audio amplifier and speaker. Its use relied, like much of the telephone hacking methodology of the time, on the use of a constant tone of 2600 Hz to indicate an unused telephone line. A free long distance telephone call (such as a 1-800 number or, less commonly, the <b>information</b> <b>operator</b> from another area code) was made using a regular telephone, and when the line was connected, a 2600 Hz tone from the blue box was fed into the mouthpiece of the telephone, causing the operator to be disconnected and a free long distance line to be available to the blue box user. The keyboard was then used to place the desired call, using multi-frequency tones specific for telephone operators. These frequencies are different from the normal touch tone frequencies used by telephone subscribers, which is why the telephone keypad could not be used and the blue box was necessary.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe shall study maximal {{errors of}} {{approximating}} linear problems. As possible classes of <b>information</b> <b>operators</b> the classes of arbitrary, continuous (nonlinear), or continuous linear <b>information</b> <b>operators</b> are considered. Algorithms {{also may be}} arbitrary, continuous (nonlinear), or linear. We focus our interest on two natural questions: (a) For what problems (the dependence on the underlying Banach spaces {{turns out to be}} crucial) do different classes of information or algorithms, respectively, yield the same quality of approximation? (b) What are the maximal differences in the errors of different classes? Both questions are treated in both the worst-case and average-case settings. Therefore the paper is divided into Parts A and B. For the study of the worst-case setting the notion of s-scales turns out to be powerful. An appropriate approach is also suggested for the average-case setting. Using the ideas of s-scales and function analytic methods we reprove some known results and obtain some new ones, thus answering questions posed in several papers on this subject...|$|R
40|$|Compressive sensing theory {{states that}} signals can be sampled {{at a much}} smaller rate than that {{required}} by the Nyquist sampling theorem, because the sampling of a signal in the former is performed as {{a relatively small number}} of its linear measurements. Thus, the design of a measurement matrix is important in compressive sensing framework. A random measurement matrix optimization method is proposed in this study based on the incoherence principle of compressive sensing, which requires the mutual coherence of <b>information</b> <b>operator</b> to be small. The columns with mutual coherence are orthogonalized iteratively to decrease the mutual coherence of the <b>information</b> <b>operator.</b> The orthogonalization is realized by replacing the columns with the orthogonal matrix of their QR factorization. An <b>information</b> <b>operator</b> with smaller mutual coherence is acquired after the optimization, leading to an improved measurement matrix in terms of its relationship with the <b>information</b> <b>operator.</b> Results of several experiments show that the improved measurement matrix can reduce its mutual coherence with dictionaries compared with the random measurement matrix. The signal reconstruction error also decreases when the optimized measurement matrix is utilized...|$|E

40|$|The inverse of the nonparametric <b>information</b> <b>operator</b> is key {{for finding}} doubly robust estimators and the semiparametric {{efficient}} estimator in missing data problems. It {{is known that}} no closed-form expression for the inverse of the nonparametric <b>information</b> <b>operator</b> exists when missing data form nonmonotone patterns. The Neumann series is usually used for approximating the inverse. However, the Neumann series approximation is only known to converge in L 2 norm, which is not sufficient for establishing statistical properties of the estimators yielded from the approximation. In this work, we show that L[infinity] convergence of the Neumann series approximations to the inverse of the nonparametric <b>information</b> <b>operator</b> and to the efficient scores in missing data problems can be obtained under very simple conditions.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of high spectral resolution Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) solar absorption spectra {{is an important}} issue in remote sensing. If this is done carefully, one can obtain information, not only about the total column abundances, but also about the vertical distribution of various constituents in the atmosphere. This work introduces the application of the <b>information</b> <b>operator</b> approach for extracting vertical profile information from ground-based FTIR measurements. The algorithm is implemented and tested within the well-known retrieval code SFIT 2, adapting the optimal estimation method such as to take into account only the significant contributions to the solution. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility of the method in an application to ground-based FTIR spectra taken in the frame of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) at Ile de La Réunion (21 ° S, 55 ° E). A thorough comparison is made between the original optimal estimation method and this alternative retrieval algorithm, regarding information content, retrieval robustness and corresponding full error budget evaluation for the target species ozone (O 3 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), methane (CH 4 ), and carbon monoxide (CO). For O 3 and CH 4 , a comparison with the Tikhonov regularization method has also been made. It is shown that the <b>information</b> <b>operator</b> approach performs well and in most cases yields both a better accuracy and stability than the optimal estimation method. Additionally, the <b>information</b> <b>operator</b> approach has the advantage of being less sensitive to the choice of a priori information.
