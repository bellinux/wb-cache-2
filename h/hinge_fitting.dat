In {{this paper}} a {{branch-and-bound}} {{algorithm is proposed}} for finding a global min-imum to a Mathematical Programming Problem with Complementarity (or Equilibrium) Constraints (MPECs), which incorporates disjunctive cuts for computing lower bounds and employs a Complementarity Active-Set Algorithm for computing upper bounds.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the data fitting of n given points in IR m by a hinge function, {{as it appears}} in Breiman (IEEE Trans on Info Theory 1993; 39 : 999 - 1013) and Pucar & Sjöberg (IEEE Trans on Info Theory 1998; 44 (3) : 1310 - 1318). This problem {{can be seen as}} a mathematical programming problem with a convex objective function and equilibrium contraints. For the euclidean error, an enumerative approach is proposed, which is a polynomial method in the sample size n, for a fixed dimension m. An alternative formulation for the l 1 error is also introduced, which is processed by a Sequential Linear Complementarity Problem approach. Some numerical results with both algorithms are included to highlight the efficiency of those procedures. Statement of scope and purpose The problem addressed here is found in applications of neural networks, nonlinear regression and data classification. Due to its nonconvex character, the application of classical nonlinear programming tools lead only to (usually suboptimal) local minima. This work proposes a global optimization method for the <b>Hinge</b> <b>Fitting</b> problem, combining combinatorial optimization and quadratic programming techniques. By achieving global optimality in reasonable time, the method compares favorably to previously proposed approaches. Key words: Least-squares problems, hinge functions, MPEC problems...|$|E

5|$|As the {{reputation}} of the Mars Works grew, so too did the demand for its products. After a few years the Mars Works began exporting its engines inland. Oliver Evans's son George was the first such order, having moved to Pittsburgh in 1809 to operate the Pittsburgh Steam Flour Mill. George and the mill were highly successful, and generated a great deal of interest in Evans's engines across the interior. However exporting engines to western Pennsylvania, Kentucky or Ohio was challenging and expensive from a logistical perspective. In 1811 Evans and George, as well as another successful steam miller and engineer Luther Stephens, founded the Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company, which in addition to engines would, like the Mars Works, produce heavy machinery and castings in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With high demand for industrial products and relatively little industrial capacity, the Pittsburgh works added to its repertoire the capacity for brasswork, as well as producing finer products for domestic purposes like <b>hinges</b> and <b>fittings.</b>|$|R
50|$|However, {{there has}} been a {{simultaneous}} revival in the fortunes of old-style hand-forged ironmongery, with strong interest in the authentic restoration of period homes leading to demand for items such as traditional iron door handles, door knobs, door knockers, letter plates, locks, <b>hinges,</b> hooks, cabinet <b>fittings</b> and window furniture. There has even been renewed use of “blacksmith nails” - four-sided hand-made rosehead nails. This is typical of a trend that has seen greater appreciation of designs that have stood the test of time, that has allowed hand-forged ironmongery to find a much wider application than use in property restoration - although the practice of incorporating traditional ironmongery into contemporary housing has been helped by thoroughly modern techniques like galvanising and powder coating to inhibit rust.|$|R

H. J. Weale revealed that the casket had belonged to the church of Saint-Julien, Brioude in Haute Loire (upper Loire region), France; {{it is possible that}} it was looted during the French Revolution. [...] It was then in the possession of a family in Auzon, a village in Haute Loire. It served as a sewing box until the silver <b>hinges</b> and <b>fittings</b> joining the panels were traded for a silver ring. Without the support of these the casket fell apart. The parts were shown to a Professor Mathieu from nearby Clermont-Ferrand, who sold them to an antique shop in Paris, where they were bought in 1857 by Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks, who subsequently donated the panels in 1867 to the British Museum, where he was Keeper of the British and Medieval collections. The missing right end panel was later found in a drawer by the family in Auzon and sold to the Bargello Museum, Florence, where it was identified as part of the casket in 1890. The British Museum display includes a cast of it.|$|R

A hinge function is the max (or min) function of two linear functions. In this paper, the author assumes the existence of smooth function f(x) {{and a set of}} samples of the form (x, f(x)) drawn from a probability distribution {rho}(x). The author hopes to find the best <b>fitting</b> <b>hinge</b> function h(x) in the least squares sense. There are two problems with this plan. First, Breiman has suggested an algorithm to perform this fit. The author shows that this algorithm is not robust and also shows how to create examples on which the algorithm diverges. Second, if the author tries to use the data to minimize the fit in the usual discrete least squares sense, the functional that must be minimized is continuous in the variables, but has a derivative which jumps at the data. This paper takes a different approach. This approach {{is an example of a}} method that the author has developed called {open_quotes}Monte Carlo Regression{close_quotes}. (A paper on the general theory is in preparation.) The author shall show that since the function f is continuous, the analytic form of the least squares equation is continuously differentiable. A local minimum is solved for by using Newton`s method, where the entries of the Hessian are estimated directly from the data by Monte Carlo. The algorithm has the desirable properties that it is quadratically convergent from any starting guess sufficiently close to a solution and that each iteration requires only a linear system solve...|$|R

While the team will be {{supplied}} with a pre-made door, they will be required to build the frame from scratch, as well as <b>fitting</b> <b>hinges</b> to the door and frame. The Blue Team mismeasure and build their frame too large, as do the Pink Team. While the Pink Team resort to just jamming shims in to even out the difference (something that the expert sharply criticize them for), the Blue Team end up remaking their entire frame, which takes up so much time that they fail to come anywhere close to finishing. Nonetheless, the experts compliment the Blue Team for the high quality of the work that they did finish, and note that Jesse and Holly have developed {{what appears to be the}} strongest team dynamic. The Green Team get the job finished, but the door is a little tight, and more significantly they did not build a new frame and re-used the existing one. While the experts are critical of this, and even moreso the fact that it took them 75 minutes before getting anything accomplished on the job, they nonetheless accept Jake's reasoning that the door frame was supporting the roof, and would have been too dangerous to remove outright. The Red Team, who felt that they had a point to prove in this challenge, successfully replace their door (a more difficult task than faced by most of the other teams, due to their unlevel cabin), almost perfectly, the only major issue being messy usage of expanding spray foam. This results in Fabian and Luayn easily being named the challenge winners.|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, I {{develop and}} defend a revised {{satisfaction}} {{account of the}} Christian doctrine of atonement based primarily on the thought of St. Anselm of Canterbury. The project thus has both a historical and a normative dimension, since I offer an interpretation of Anselm, and then derive from it {{an account of the}} atonement as a candidate for how Christians ought to think about and understand what God has accomplished in Christ on our behalf. I begin, in Chapter 2, by examining the most common way of framing the doctrine of atonement today, which I call the “atonement theory paradigm”—a paradigm into which Anselm is supposed to fit neatly. The atonement theory paradigm assumes that a set of traditional concepts applied to Christ’s work stand for theories of atonement which are fundamentally alternatives to one another. According to this paradigm, at a face-value reading, either Christ saves by defeating oppressive forces and liberating us from them (Christus Victor), or he saves us by offering himself to the Father as a perfect sacrifice, or he saves us by providing a saving teaching and example of the proper love of God (moral exemplar), etc. What follows from this is that one either has to select one such theory or else interpret them more loosely and metaphorically, holding them together without integrating them into a unified view. I argue that neither of these approaches is ideal from the perspective of Christian theology; all things being equal, it would be preferable to hold together such deeply-entrenched theological claims with their full force. Thankfully, they do not actually contradict one another in any obvious way. In Chapter 3, I proceed to develop a detailed interpretation of Anselm’s Cur Deus Homo which understands him not to be presenting an alternative theory to other supposed theories of atonement but to be identifying an underlying logic according to which all of the main traditional ways of talking Christ’s work can be understood as fitting and necessary. That is, I argue that Anselm does not fit the atonement theory paradigm, and that he presents us with a way of understanding Christ’s work that avoids the weaknesses of that paradigm. Attending to the details of Anselm’s text, as well as to several of his earlier treatises, it becomes apparent that many prominent criticisms of his theology of atonement <b>hinge</b> on <b>fitting</b> it into the atonement theory paradigm, and hence my reinterpretation helps to show where such critiques miss the mark. Moving from there, in Chapter 4 I develop a revised satisfaction account that moves beyond a reproduction of Anselm. I do this by attending to another medieval theologian who made use of Anselm’s concept of satisfaction, namely St. Thomas Aquinas. Thomas differs from Anselm on some important points, including especially the question of whether God made use of the means of satisfaction to bring about the salvation of human persons by necessity, or as a contingent choice from among other genuine alternatives. Thomas also provides a helpful elaboration to Anselm, since his account of Christ’s Passion in the Summa Theologiae is more systematic and comprehensive than Anselm’s treatise. Thomas thus helps to show more clearly than Anselm that satisfaction is compatible with other atonement concepts. Finally, Thomas’s concept of friendship with God, and his connection of satisfaction with the maintenance of such friendship (through the sacrament of penance) helps to make it more clear than it is in Cur Deus Homo how a satisfaction account of atonement relates to the spiritual life of a Christian striving to grow in holiness and in the love of God. By considering these differences and elaborations, I arrive at a revised satisfaction account that is based on Anselm but has a greater breadth than one could get from Anselm’s text by itself. Finally, with this revised account of the atonement in hand, in Chapter 5, I consider one prominent form of critique normally applied to satisfaction accounts by contemporary theologians. According to many feminist, womanist, and other liberationist thinkers, accounts like the one I develop here are harmful to oppressed persons, such as those undergoing spousal abuse, because they provide a motive for thinking that passively accepting such suffering is Christ-like. I examine how the inference involved in this critique works, and then argue that if we attend to the details of our satisfaction account, we can see that it does not hold. On this account of satisfaction, God does not value suffering for its own sake, but only for the sake of some good end, ultimately justice. On the contrary, our account suggests that whenever possible those who perpetrate injustice ought to try to make satisfaction, and that the satisfaction assigned ought to be of the sort which would teach wrongdoers to will what they ought to will towards the ones wronged. I consider two cases to elucidate this response: the case of spousal abuse, and the case of calls for reparations for slavery in the United States. In both cases, I argue that the logic of the satisfaction account developed here runs in the opposite way to that supposed by the critique, since it would entail that is either necessary or extremely fitting according to justice for the wrongdoers to perform an act of satisfaction rather than be forgiven without satisfaction...|$|R
