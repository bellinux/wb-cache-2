2500|$|With {{the rise}} of the feminist {{movement}} in the twentieth century, reactions to the play have tended to become more divergent. For some critics, [...] "Kate's taming was no longer as funny as it had been [...] her domination became, in George Bernard Shaw's words 'altogether disgusting to modern sensibility'." [...] Addressing the relationship between A Shrew and The Shrew from a political perspective, for example, Leah S. Marcus very much believes the play to be what it seems. She argues A Shrew is an earlier version of The Shrew, but acknowledges that most scholars reject the idea that A Shrew was written by Shakespeare. She believes {{one of the reasons for}} this is because A Shrew [...] "hedges the play's patriarchal message with numerous qualifiers that do not exist in" [...] The Shrew. She calls A Shrew a more [...] "progressive" [...] text than The Shrew, and argues that scholars tend to dismiss the idea that A Shrew is Shakespearean because [...] "the women are not as satisfactorily tamed as they are in The Shrew." [...] She also points out that if A Shrew is an early draft, it suggests Shakespeare [...] "may have increased rather than decreased the patriarchal violence of his materials", something which, she believes, scholars <b>find</b> <b>difficult</b> to accept.|$|E

2500|$|During the 14th century Giotto di Bondone and his {{followers}} began to acknowledge nature in their work, increasingly introducing elements of the landscape as the background setting for {{the action of the}} figures in their paintings. Early in the 15th century, landscape painting was established as a genre in Europe, as a setting for human activity, often expressed in a religious subject, such as the themes of the , the Journey of the Magi, or Saint Jerome in the Desert. Luxury illuminated manuscripts were very important in the early development of landscape, especially series of the Labours of the Months such as those in the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, which conventionally showed small genre figures in increasingly large landscape settings. A particular advance is shown in the less well-known Turin-Milan Hours, now largely destroyed by fire, whose developments were reflected in Early Netherlandish painting {{for the rest of the}} century. The artist known as [...] "Hand G", probably one of the Van Eyck brothers, was especially successful in reproducing effects of light and in a natural-seeming progression from the foreground to the distant view. This was something other artists were to <b>find</b> <b>difficult</b> for a century or more, often solving the problem by showing a landscape background from over the top of a parapet or window-sill, as if from a considerable height.|$|E

60|$|People {{say that}} my uncle lost {{his head at the}} crest of his fortunes, but if one may tell so much truth of a man one has in a manner loved, he never had very much head to lose. He was always imaginative, erratic, inconsistent, {{recklessly}} inexact, and his inundation of wealth merely gave him scope for these qualities. It is true, indeed, that towards the climax he became intensely irritable at times and impatient of contradiction, but that, I think, was rather the gnawing uneasiness of sanity than any mental disturbance. But I find it hard either to judge him or convey the full development of him to the reader. I saw too much of him; my memory is choked with disarranged moods and aspects. Now he is distended with megalomania, now he is deflated, now he is quarrelsome, now impenetrably self-satisfied, but always he is sudden, jerky, fragmentary, energetic, and--in some subtle fundamental way that I <b>find</b> <b>difficult</b> to define--absurd.|$|E
60|$|But {{it is not}} so; the serious, {{laborious}} {{authors of}} the long Cyclic poems do such un-Homeric things as these; the gay, irresponsible strolling singers of a lay here and a lay there-- lays now incorporated in the Iliad and Odyssey-- scrupulously avoid such faults. They never even introduce a signet ring. These are difficulties {{in the theory of}} the Iliad as a patchwork by many hands, in many ages, which nobody explains; which, indeed, nobody seems to <b>find</b> <b>difficult.</b> Yet the difficulty is insuperable. Even if we take refuge with Wilamowitz in the idea that the Cyclic and Homeric poems were at first mere protoplasm of lays of many ages, and that they were all compiled, say in the sixth century, into so many narratives, we come no nearer to explaining why the tone, taste, and ideas of two such narratives-- Illiad and Odyssey--are confessedly distinct from the tone, taste, and ideas of all the others. The Cyclic poems are certainly the production of a late and changed age? [Footnote: For what manner of audience, if not for readers, the Cyclic poems were composed is a mysterious question.] The Iliad is not in any degree-- save perhaps in a few interpolated passages--touched by the influences of that late age. It is not a complex of the work of four incompatible centuries, as far as this point is concerned-- the point of legend, religion, ritual, and conception of heroic character.|$|E
6000|$|In {{spite of}} its really {{considerable}} extent, the forest of Fontainebleau is hardly anywhere tedious. I know the whole western side of it with what, I suppose, I may call thoroughness; well enough at least to testify {{that there is no}} square mile without some special character and charm. Such quarters, for instance, as the Long Rocher, the Bas-Breau, and the Reine Blanche, might be a hundred miles apart; they have scarce a point in common beyond the silence of the birds. The two last are really conterminous; and in both are tall and ancient trees that have outlived a thousand political vicissitudes. But in the one the great oaks prosper placidly upon an even floor; they beshadow a great field; and the air and the light are very free below their stretching boughs. In the other the trees <b>find</b> <b>difficult</b> footing; castles of white rock lie tumbled one upon another, the foot slips, the crooked viper slumbers, the moss clings in the crevice; and above it all the great beech goes spiring and casting forth her arms, and, with a grace beyond church architecture, canopies this rugged chaos. [...] Meanwhile, dividing the two cantons, the broad white causeway of the Paris road runs in an avenue: a road conceived for pageantry and for triumphal marches, an avenue for an army; but, its days of glory over, it now lies grilling in the sun between cool groves, and only at intervals the vehicle of the cruising tourist is seen far away and faintly audible along its ample sweep. A little upon one side, and you find a district of sand and birch and boulder; a little upon the other lies the valley of Apremont, all juniper and heather; and close beyond that you may walk into a zone of pine trees. So artfully are the ingredients mingled. Nor must it be forgotten that, in all this part, you come continually forth upon a hill-top, and behold the plain, northward and westward, like an unrefulgent sea; nor that all day long the shadows keep changing; and at last, to the red fires of sunset, night succeeds, and with the night a new forest, full of whisper, gloom, and fragrance. [...] There are few things more renovating than to leave Paris, the lamplit arches of the Carrousel, and the long alignment of the glittering streets, and to bathe the senses in this fragrant darkness of the wood.|$|E
