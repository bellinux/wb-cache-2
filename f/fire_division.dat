40|$|This report {{analyzes}} {{data from}} several city reports and additional independent {{research on the}} potential impact of closing the current Fire Station # 1. We analyzed current Mankato Department of Public Safety, <b>Fire</b> <b>Division</b> response times and staffing levels and compared them to proposed response times and staffing levels. Data was collected as a result of open communication between citizens and the city. It includes information from personal interviews, city resources, and independent agencies. Through the research we compiled, we found that a community-based public safety model is the best model for supporting and maintaining safe communities throughout Mankato. It concludes that making such proposed changes would negatively affect the quality of service delivery and coverage in significant parts of Mankato. This report was prepared by the Co-President of the Tourtellotte Park Neighborhood Association (TPNA) and was reviewed and edited by the executive committee of TPNA.

40|$|The {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out between 1999 and 2001 by the Gas and <b>Fire</b> <b>Division,</b> OE Kaelte, Luftqualitaet {{on behalf of the}} DKS and with funds from the Germans state of Nordrhein-Westfalen. The following aspects were investigated in particular: 1. The application of driers for precooling of mine air; 2. Test stand measurements of air coolers; 3. Underground performance of air coolers. Prior to the measurements, theoretical calculations were made. In {{view of the fact that}} air temperatures at the place of work should not fall below a certain level for ergonomic reasons, the capacity of precooling in the longwall mine is limited. Air drying offers a possibility of ensuring low enthalpy within the ergonomically required minimum temperatures. Moisture is reduced by a drastic reduction of the air temperature which causes condensation of the water vapour, followed by dry heating of the air to the required minimum temperature.
