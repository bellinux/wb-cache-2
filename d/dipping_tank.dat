40|$|Tick Infestation and Tick Borne Diseases (TBDs), are {{important}} conditions that affect livestock health and productivity in Zimbabwe. Ticks {{are responsible for}} the direct damage to livestock hides through feeding habits, damage to udders, teats and scrotum. Ticks transmit a large variety of diseases that affect livestock the major diseases include Babesiosis, Anaplasmosis, Theileriosis and Ehrlichiosis. In order to improve on livestock productivity, effective tick control measures should be taken.

The larvae obtained from engorged females of the one host tick Rhipicephalus (B). microplus from twelve communal dipping areas were tested against various concentrations of amitraz, chlorfenvinphos and cypermethrin using the Shaw Larval Immersion Test method. Only R. (B). microplus ticks were identified from all sample areas, indicating a displacement of the indigenous R. (B). decoloratus tick in this area. Resistance testing using the Shaw Larval Immersion Test showed that no resistance to chlorfenvinphos was detected {{at any of the}} <b>dip</b> <b>tanks,</b> which was in keeping with the absence of known use of this product in the area. An important finding was the rapid development of resistance to the pyrethroids, which had only been in use for four months prior to conducting the study. Only one area (Hlalakane) yielded a R(B). spp population that was wholly susceptible to all three compounds. Resistance to amitraz was variable, with half (six out of 12) of the <b>dip</b> <b>tanks</b> comprising susceptible R(B). spp populations and two <b>dip</b> <b>tanks</b> with emerging resistance to amitraz.

40|$|Bovine {{babesiosis}} occurs {{worldwide and}} is one of the most costly tick-borne cattle diseases in the tropics. The Soutpansberg region of the Northern Province in South Africa is endemic for Babesia bigemina, but Babesia bovis was only reported from this area in the 1980 s when some farmers experienced heavy losses due to Asiatic redwater. The main objectives of the study were to confirm the presence of the tick vector Boophilus microplus in the Soutpansberg region where it had not been reported previously, and to determine the seroprevalence of Babesia bovis and Babesia bigemina in cattle in these areas. Other objectives were to assess the relative numbers of Boophilus microplus in relation to Boophilus decoloratus and to determine a possible displacement of Boophilus decoloratus by Boophilus microplus. It was also the intention to map the potential distribution of the Boophilus ticks in the area and to more accurately predict the further spread of Boophilus microplus. Tick collections and serological surveys were carried out during 1999 and 2000 on cattle at 30 communal <b>dip</b> <b>tanks</b> and on 5 commercial farms in the Soutpansberg, Dzanani, Mutale, Thohoyandou and Vuwani Districts. Of the 25, 042 Boophilus ticks collected, 93. 9 % were Boophilus microplus and 6. 1 % were Boophilus decoloratus. At 8 of the dip tanks/farms both Boophilusspecies were found, and the displacement of Boophilus decoloratus by Boophilus microplus was monitored at 4 of these sites. There was a distinct displacement of Boophilus decoloratus at those dip tanks/farms where repeated tick collection was possible. Cattle at the communal <b>dip</b> <b>tanks</b> carried larger Boophilustick numbers than cattle on the commercial farms. Boophilus microplus was the most common Boophilustick collected at the <b>dip</b> <b>tanks,</b> and during the survey it also became the Boophilustick most commonly found on the commercial farms. CLIMEX was used to map the potential distribution of Boophilus microplus and Boophilus decoloratus in the survey area during years with average as well as double average rainfall. Ecoclimatic Indices were computed for each sampling location, using 30 years of climatic information. The displacement patterns of Boophilus species were also discussed. Blood samples (n = 2201) were collected for Indirect Fluorescent Antibody (IFA) testing. Serological evidence of Babesia bovis was detected in 97 % of the communal <b>dip</b> <b>tank</b> herds and in 100 % of the commercial farm herds. The overall seroprevalence of Babesia bovis in the <b>dip</b> <b>tank</b> herds during 1999 and 2000 was 63 %. The seroprevalence of Babesia bovis in the commercial herds increased significantly from 19 % in 1999 to 57. 5 % in 2000. There was a slight increase in endemic stability in comparable herds from 1999 to 2000. The increase in seroprevalence and endemic stability probably came as a result of the influx of Boophilus microplus into the survey area. There was a significant correlation between the presence of Boophilus microplus in the survey area and the increasing seroprevalence of Babesia bovis, which confirms that Boophilus microplus is the main and probably the only vector of Babesia bovis in South Africa. Serological evidence of Babesia bigemina was detected in 100 % of communal <b>dip</b> <b>tank</b> and commercial farm herds. The overall seroprevalence of Babesia bigemina in the <b>dip</b> <b>tank</b> herds decreased significantly from 56. 1 % in 1999 to 49. 3 % in 2000. There was a marked decrease in endemic stability for Babesia bigemina in comparable <b>dip</b> <b>tank</b> herds from 1999 to 2000. The decrease in seroprevalence and endemic stability to Babesia bigemina in these herds was probably due to the substantial increase of Boophilus microplus in the survey area. This may indicate that Babesia bigeminaa was transmitted less effectively by Boophilus microplus than by Boophilus decoloratus. The seroprevalence of Babesia bovis was significantly higher than that of Babesia bigemina at those dip tanks/farms where only Boophilus microplus was present during 1999 and 2000. This may be explained by the possibility that Boophilus microplus transmits Babesia bigemina less effectively than it transmits Babesia bovis. This survey raises several questions on the ability of the African strain of Boophilus microplus to transmit African Babesiastrains. There are indications that the African Boophilus microplus is different to the Australian Boophilus microplus. More research needs to be done to investigate how the Babesia species are transmitted in Africa. Dissertation (MSc (Veterinary Sciences)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of BTB in the cattle population of selected <b>dip</b> <b>tanks</b> in Swaziland. Furthermore, the zoonotic risk to farmers whose cattle are infected with BTB was assessed by means of a questionnaire survey. Abattoir surveillance identified 16 <b>dip</b> <b>tanks</b> of study where at least 10 % of the cattle were tested for BTB using the comparative intra-dermal skin. In five of these <b>dip</b> <b>tanks,</b> the same cattle were tested for BTB using the IFN-γ Test. Eight BTB skin test positive animals were slaughtered and a detailed post mortem examination was conducted and samples collected for the isolation of M. bovis. Concurrent with BTB testing, a questionnaire survey was conducted to determine risk factors for humans. The prevalence of BTB was found to be 6. 75 % in the study population and 20 % of BTB positive animals were diagnosed by both the CIST and IFN-γ, indicating a correlation for the test positive animals in the two tests. M. bovis was isolated from seven of the eight animals slaughtered. Farmers’ knowledge of BTB as a cattle disease and serious zoonosis is insufficient and inadequate while consumption practices of products of bovine origin exposes them to the risk of infection by M. bovis. There is a need to investigate the extent of M. bovis infections in the human population. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013. gm 2014 Veterinary Tropical Diseasesunrestricte...|$|R

Cattle seropositive for B. bovis were found in 97 % of the herds on communal land; the overall seroprevalence changed little between 1999 (63. 3 %) and 2000 (62. 4 %). All herds surveyed were infected with B. bigemina, and overall seroprevalence decreased significantly from 56. 1 % in 1999 to 49. 3 % in 2000. In herds on communal land in Sour Lowveld Bushveld, overall seroprevalence of B. bovis increased from 70 % in 1999 to 80 % in 2000, while seroprevalence of B. bigemina decreased from 70 % in 1999 to 30 % in 2000. This was possibly due to an influx of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus that occurred at the time. In commercially farmed herds the seroprevalence to B. bovis increased significantly from 19 % in 1999 to 57. 5 % in 2000.

Since 1990, sporadic blood sampling of cattle at the <b>dip</b> <b>tanks</b> in the naganainfested areas were undertaken to identify trypanosome species involved and to determine the infection prevalence in cattle. The distribution and species composition of the tsetse populations in the area were also investigated.

During April 2005 to August 2009 the distribution and abundance of tsetse populations were assessed with odour-baited H traps. The tsetse and trypanosome distribution maps were updated and potential correlations between tsetse apparent densities (ADs) and the prevalence of trypanosomosis were assessed. Glossina brevipalpis Newstead and Glossina austeni Newstead were recorded in locations where they have not previously been collected. No significant correlation between tsetse relative abundance and nagana prevalence was found, which indicated complex interactions between tsetse fly presence and disease prevalence. This was epitomised by data that indicated that despite large differences in the ADs of G. austeni and G. brevipalpis, trypanosome infection prevalence was similar in all three districts in the area.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the population distribution in the Mnisi area, a rural area in the Mpumalanga Province in The Republic of South Africa. Also the bull health and fertility of the herd was evaluated. During the field study a questionnaire was carried out with the owners, bull were clinically observed the birth figures of the cattle register were analyzed. The Mnisi study area (= 15 <b>dip</b> <b>tanks)</b> has 1, 097 owners and they all together have 12, 005 head of cattle. An average herd consists of 17 head of cattle, divided into 2 bulls, 1 ox, 8 cows, 3 heifers and 3 calves. 52 % of the farmers have a small herd, 22 % of the farmers have a medium herd and 26 % of the farmers have a large herd. The average percentage of bulls, oxen, cows, heifers and calves at a certain <b>dip</b> <b>tank</b> are respectively 11 %, 6 %, 46 %, 19 %, 18 %. In the area the breed Bos indicus is particularly present. 40 % of the owners in the Mnisi study area use a specific bull for breeding. 72 % of the owners {{do think that the}} bulls are good enough for breeding in their herd. The bulls in the area have an estimated average age of three years and eight months. The bulls in the area seem to be healthy. The calving rate is with a 17, 1 % quite low. A cow gets a calve every two years and nine months. A major part of the calves is born {{in the first three months}} of the year (January-March). There is a relationship between calves born and the rainfall nine months previously (p < 0, 05) ...|$|R
