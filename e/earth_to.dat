5|$|George Forbes was {{the first}} to {{postulate}} the existence of trans-Neptunian planets in 1880, and his work is considered similar to more recent Planet Nine theories. In Forbes's model the planet had a semi-major axis of ∼300 AU (roughly three hundred times the distance from <b>Earth</b> <b>to</b> the Sun); locations were based on clustering of the aphelion distances of periodic comets.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to dissolved gases, hot water from geothermal sources may hold in solution trace amounts of toxic {{elements such as}} mercury, arsenic, boron, and antimony. These chemicals precipitate as the water cools, and can cause environmental damage if released. The modern practice of injecting cooled geothermal fluids back into the <b>Earth</b> <b>to</b> stimulate production has the side benefit of reducing this environmental risk.|$|E
