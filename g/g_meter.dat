40|$|The article {{reviewed}} in this commentary takes philosophical models of temporal experience as its starting point, in {{an exploration of}} how an "experience of succession" may be distinguished from a mere "succession of experience". It is proposed that context is the important factor in differentiating the two experiences, rather than duration. Context is accounted for in broad terms, with specific discussion of gesture, performance environment, and mental imagery. The discussion may usefully {{pave the way for}} future collaboration between philosophers and psychologists. However, there are multiple fundamental findings in music cognition research, vital to any consideration of the context in which musical experiences occur (e. <b>g.</b> <b>meter,</b> tonality, expectation, familiarity), that could be factored into this discussion. The ideas discussed could be developed with greater consideration of recent empirical studies in music perception. Perhaps then a theoretical model of the experience of succession of musical events could give rise to experimental hypotheses, which may then be tested in order to further refine such models...|$|E

40|$|Rhetorical theory {{suggests}} that rhythmic and metrical features of language substantially contribute to persuading, moving, and pleasing an audience. A potential explanation of these effects is offered by "cognitive fluency theory," which stipulates that recurring patterns (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>meter)</b> enhance perceptual fluency {{and can lead to}} greater aesthetic appreciation. In this article, we explore these two assertions by investigating the effects of meter and rhyme in the reception of poetry by means of event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Participants listened to four versions of lyrical stanzas that varied in terms of meter and rhyme, and rated the stanzas for rhythmicity and aesthetic liking. The behavioral and ERP results were in accord with enhanced liking and rhythmicity ratings for metered and rhyming stanzas. The metered and rhyming stanzas elicited smaller N 400 /P 600 ERP responses than their nonmetered, nonrhyming, or nonmetered and nonrhyming counterparts. In addition, the N 400 and P 600 effects for the lyrical stanzas correlated with aesthetic liking effects (metered-nonmetered), implying that modulation of the N 400 and P 600 has a direct bearing on the aesthetic appreciation of lyrical stanzas. We suggest that these effects are indicative of perceptual-fluency-enhanced aesthetic liking, as postulated by cognitive fluency theory...|$|E
40|$|A {{program in}} FORTRAN 90 is {{developed}} which can adjust relative gravity measurements and solve for gravimeter parameters using the weighted constraint and datum-free constraint models. The weighted constraint model is chosen when there exist reliable a priori gravity values {{for use as}} supplementary data, or when it is required that a gravity network be attached to an existing gravity network of a higher order. The datum-free model uniquely determines relative gravity values among all stations without the need of a fixed gravity value, thus it is suitable for detecting relative gravity change.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{gas flow}} meters (USMs) may be {{influenced}} by pressure and temperature in several ways. Change of the meter body's cross-sectional area (the "pipe bore") influences directly on the amount of gas flowing through the meter. Change of the ultrasonic path geometry (i. e. change of the inclination angles and lateral chord positions, caused by e. <b>g.</b> <b>meter</b> body diameter change and change of the orientation of the ultrasonic transducer ports) influences on the transit times and the numerical integration method of the meter. Change of the Reynolds number influences on the integration method. Change of the length of the ultrasonic transducer ports influences on the acoustic path lengths, and thus on the transit times. Likewise, change of the length of the ultrasonic transducers influences on the acoustic path lengths, and thus on the transit times. In addition, changes of the transducer properties such as the directivity, influences on the diffraction correction, and thus on the transit times.

40|$|Abstract. Policy {{frameworks}} {{provide a}} technique for improving reuse in program analysis: {{the same language}} frontend, and a core analysis semantics, can be shared among multiple analysis policies for the same language, while analysis domains (such as units of measurement) can be shared among frameworks for different languages. One limitation of policy frameworks is that, in practice, adding a new policy can still require a significant level {{of knowledge about the}} internals of the semantics definition. This abstract describes work on extending policy frameworks to solve this limitation, making policies reflective over their requirements and generating the policy semantics from a higher-level policy description language. Using executable language definitions, such as rewriting logic semantics [9] (RLS) or K [11] definitions running in Maude [4], program analysis can be treated as a form of non-standard program evaluation over appropriate domains of abstract values.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the current}} {{environment}} of decreasing budgets, {{the need for}} an accurate and reliable fatigue usage monitoring system is of ever increasing importance to ensure the safe and economical utilisation of aircraft which are expected to last longer than ever before. Strain based in-flight data recorders are perceived to provide an increase in accuracy over the traditional fatigue <b>g</b> <b>meter,</b> and have thus been implemented by many military fleet operators worldwide particularly for agile aircraft. Although this may be the case, these new generation recorders and the systems required for fatigue damage interpretation are complex, and many problems are associated with their use. Military design requirements mandate the incorporation of fatigue monitoring data recorders, however the specifications allow much scope in the implementation of the system and interpretation of the data. Therefore, there exist numerous and varied philosophies for the usage monitoring of aircraft worldwide. This paper proposes a unified approach for fatigue usage monitoring of modern fighter aircraft and is based on experience primarily with the F/A- 18, and discusses the requirements for future fatigue monitoring systems based on strain and flight parameter measurements. Areas covered include the choice of gauge locations, need for flight parameters, data collection rates, calibration of damage models to durability tests, reliability of strain sensors, data integrity, and the in-flight calibration of strain sensors.

The gPhone is essentially a LaCoste & Romberg, model <b>G</b> <b>meter,</b> but with an improved thermal system (a double oven) for increased temperature stability, which should result in an unprecedented improvement in noise and drift of this mechanical gravimeter. We test the performances of the gPhone- 054 in terms of resolution, accuracy, noise level and long-term stability (drift) with respect to the SG-C 026. Our comparative analysis is performed in a wide spectral domain, ranging from the body tides to the seismic band. This study confirms that the SG has better performances over the whole analysed spectral band. The gPhone- 054 instrumental drift observed during this study still remains a critical point preventing the study of long-term gravity changes. In fact, compared with the SG, the drift is large and even non-linear. We observed a drift rate evolution characterized by a decrease from 50 ÂµGal/day to 15 ÂµGal/day, after about 1 month of operation. This makes it hard to distinguish real-time gravity changes from the instrumental drift. We tried to improve the drift modelling by using frequent absolute gravity (AG) measurements, but unfortunately during that time no significant gravity changes have been detected which would have helped us to discriminate short-term drift excursions from real gravity changes. In terms of noise levels, the gPhone- 054 turns out to be about 10 times noisier than the SG-C 026 at seismic frequencies, while in the tidal band, it is twice as noisy. In between, at periods ranging from 1 h to 6 h, the gPhone- 054 is about 3 times noisier than the SG-C 026 but performs slightly better than the Scintrex CG 5 in terms of noise level and precision...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Early music {{training}} {{provides an}} excellent model for studying neural plasticity and understanding the relations between music and speech processing; and it has implications for speech and language development. Most of the recent experimental evidence comes from cross-sectional studies of individuals with different music learning backgrounds. Data from these studies suggest an experience-related enhancement for high-level music pitch processing (e. g. chord and melody processing), and generalization to pitch processing in speech. However, {{little is known about}} processing in the temporal domain, where critical information lies both in music and speech, especially at the level of temporal structure. In music, temporal structure (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>meter)</b> groups beats into units to help generate differential expectations for strong and weak beats (marching vs. waltz). In speech, temporal structure carries critical information such as syllable structure. The current study aimed to elucidate the effect of a short-term music intervention on infants' neural processing of temporal structure in music and speech using a random-assignment approach. Forty-seven 9 -month-olds were randomly assigned to complete 12 sessions (~ 4 wks) of social, multimodal music intervention (Intervention group) or 12 sessions of social free play (Control group). The mismatch response (MMR) was the target neural measure used to quantify infants' processing of temporal structure both in music and in speech after the intervention/control sessions. Using Magnetoencephalography (MEG) with good spatial resolution, we compared the MMRs in the temporal cortical regions {{as well as in the}} prefrontal regions between the Intervention and the Control groups. The results showed that the Intervention group exhibited larger MMRs in both temporal and prefrontal regions than their Control group counterparts, indicating stronger ability to track high-level temporal structure, as hypothesized. It is the first known experiment demonstrating an effect of music intervention in the temporal information processing domain in infancy, and the first to show generalization from music intervention to speech processing in infancy. The results provide important implications for our understanding of auditory experience-related effects on music and speech early in development...|$|E

Here {{we report on the}} results of a comparative analysis carried out on more than ten months of co-located record collected with a new generation spring gravimeter, the gPhone- 054, owned by the IGN of Madrid (Spain), and the GWR-C 026 superconducting gravimeter (SG-C 026) at the J 9 gravity station in Strasbourg (France). The Microg-LaCoste gPhone is a portable Earth tide gravimeter equipped with a 0. 1 ÂµGal resolution feedback. The core sensor is the patented LaCoste & Romberg (LR) zero-length spring suspension system. The gPhone is essentially a LR, model <b>G</b> <b>meter,</b> but with significant upgrades: it has an improved thermal system (a double-oven) for increased temperature stability. Moreover the instrument should have a âtrueâ vacuum seal making it almost insensitive to the buoyancy changes due to atmospheric pressure fluctuations. We test the performances of the gPhone- 054 in terms of resolution, accuracy, noise level and long-term stability (drift) with respect to the SG-C 026. Our comparative analysis is performed in a wide spectral domain, ranging from the body tides to the seismic band. This study demonstrates that the SGs have better performances in the whole analyzed spectral band. Focusing on the gPhone- 054 instrumental drift observed during this study, it still remains a critical point preventing the study of the long-term gravity changes. In fact the drift was large and even not linear, sometimes requiring a high degree (> 4) polynomial fitting to be reduced; the latter makes hard to distinguish real time gravity changes from the instrumental drift. We observed a drift rate evolution characterized by a decrease from 50 ÂµGal/day to 15 ÂµGal/day, after about 1 month of operation. Moreover we tried to improve the drift modeling by using frequent (about every 5 days) absolute gravity (AG) measurements collected within about forty days; the measurements have been carried out with FG 5 # 211, but unfortunately during that time no significant gravity changes have been detected which would have helped us to discriminate short-term drift excursions from real gravity changes by superimposing the gPhone data onto the AG points...|$|E
40|$|Power {{quality is}} a subject that has {{received}} a lot of attention during the last 10 to 20 years, both in industry and in academia. Power quality concerns interaction between the power grid and its customers and between the power grid and equipment connected to it, reflected in voltages and currents. Research and other developments in this area have to a great extent concentrated on relatively slow and low-frequency phenomena, with the main emphasis being on voltage dips (reductions in voltage magnitude with duration between about 50 ms and several seconds) and low-frequency harmonics (waveform distortion by frequency components up to about 2 kHz). These phenomena are reasonably well understood and several standards cover the area. For higher-frequency phenomena, above 2 kHz, there is no such general understanding, nor is there anything close to a complete set of standards covering this area. Modern energy efficient equipment connected to the grid, like fluorescent lamps but also solar panels, often uses switching technology, with switching frequencies that can range from a couple of kHz up to several hundreds of kHz. The grid is also used for communication of e. <b>g.</b> <b>meter</b> readings, system controls etc. This so-called power-line communication is using the same frequency range. The main frequency range of interest for this thesis has been the range from 2 to 150 kHz. There are two completely different measurement methods covering this frequency range: time-domain based and frequency-domain based. Time domain based measurements are used throughout the thesis. This gives an opportunity to choose between different analysing tools where among others the joint time-frequency domain has shown to be a useful tool for describing waveform distortion in our frequency range of interest. The majority of the measurements presented in this thesis have been directed towards fluorescent light powered by high frequency ballasts. This type of load has been, due to stringent harmonic limits, {{one of the first to}} use a more advanced switching technology called active power factor correction. This technique is also getting more frequently used in other small-power equipment, like computers. Installations of lights in stores etc. normally contain a large number of ballast connected together and the interaction is of importance, for example for setting emission and immunity standards. The measurements on ballasts presented in this work have shown that distortion in the frequency rage 2 - 150 kHz comes in three types: narrowband distortion; wideband distortion; and recurrent oscillations. The recurrent oscillations are a new type of powerquality disturbance that had not been recognized as such before. The measurements further have shown that the three types of distortion spread in a completely different way from the individual devices to the grid. This knowledge is essential for the setting of emission requirements on energy-efficient equipment.

40|$|The Tag, Track and Location System (TTL) Program is {{investigating}} methods of tracking an asset using perfluorocarbon tracers (PFT). The success of any TTL method requires sound detection/location instrumentation. Tracer Detection Technologies Corp (TDT), through {{a contract with}} the Office of Naval Research (ONR), {{is investigating}} different detection systems. The detections systems generally fall into two categories; proximity detectors and standoff detectors. Proximity detectors, as the name implies, need to be in close proximity (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>meter</b> to 10 's of meters) to the PFT source. Standoff detection searches for the PFT from a greater distance away from the source (e. g., 100 's of meters to kilometers). Gas Chromatographs (GC) are generally considered a proximity detection systems, {{but in the case of}} PFTs should be considered for both proximity and standoff detection with the caveat that in standoff use the GC needs to be somewhere in the PFT plume, i. e., generally downwind of the source. With a properly sized PFT source, the right GC can afford fairly large standoff (distance from the source) distances; 100 's of meters to kilometers downwind. Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) has such a GC system and offered to demonstrate the CDTA for TTL as a no cost addition to the TDTTTL project, of which BNL was a participant. BNL is a leading authority on the sampling, collection, release and detection of PFTs. In addition, the BNL team has extensive background in atmospheric dispersion, the application of PFTs to such studies and the development of applications utilizing PFTs such as building infiltration measurements, control room integrity determination, leak location and environmental investigations. This experience and expertise is essential in developing any PFT application were dispersion, dilution and overcoming environmental conditions and interferences are integral to success. BNL has developed sophisticated gas chromatography methods and instruments that allow detection of up to seven PFTs at part per quadrillion levels (1015) with sample times as short as 60 seconds. The Continuous Dual-Trap Analyzer (CDTA) was developed for leak hunting applications and can continuously sample the air for PFTs without interruption. Sample time can be as short as 60 seconds. The CDTA has been extensively used in the commercial sector to detect PFTs that have been introduced to leaking buried dielectric fluid-filled cables or leaking subsurface gas lines. The PFTs travel through the cable or pipe until they reach the leak site. PFTs then escape into the surrounding soil and permeate/diffuse to the surface where they can be detected with the CDTA. Typically a cable is tagged with ppm levels of PFTs resulting in ppt to ppq concentrations in the air at the leak site. The CDTA is proven to be rugged, reliable and has a proven track record of successful leak location. The application of the CDTA to PFT detection for TTL is identical to application for leak detection. The CDTA operator has a general idea, with a few miles of roadway, where the leak is located, but no specific knowledge of the location (it can be any where along the road). The CDTA is mounted in a Chevy Astro Van and is dispatched to the field. In the field the van is driven at nominally 15 mph along the road. The CDTA continuously samples the air outside the van (via a 1 / 4 -inch plastic sample tube stuck out a side window) until a positive detection occurs. The van then covers the road section where the detection occurred at a slightly slower pace to pin-point the area where the leak is and to direct soil probe samples. The soil probe samples take soil gas samples every 10 yards or so and the samples are analyzed on the CDTA. The leak can be located to within a few feet in 95 % of the cases. To date the CDTA has been successful in every leak hunt performed by BNL. One interesting case was a leak hunt that resulted in repeated negative detections. The confidence in the CDTA forced the utility to recheck its 'plumbing' which lead to the discovery that a valve was turned that shouldn't have been so that gas was being diverted rather than leaking (the pressure drop was due to this diversion of the gas to another line). For TTL application, a tagged item or person is known to be in a general area and can be located by detecting the PFT emanating from the tagging source. The CDTA can be deployed in the area and by sampling in a grid fashion (starting on the downwind side of the area of interest) can easily find even very small sources. The CDTA is a perfect match for this application and the leak hunt use basically a simulation of Track and Locate. No other PFT detection technology has the detection sensitivity, proven track record and ruggedness of the CDTA. For these reasons, BNL offered to demonstrate the CDTA for TTL as a no cost addition to the TTL lidar demonstration project. This report details the demonstration scenario and results...|$|E

Here, we propose a key management architecture and associated protocols tailored to support encrypted smart grid communications. The architecture consists of two levels structured around the grid control system hierarchy. At the top level, which consist of control centers and regional coordinators, a bottom-up key structure is adopted using hash chaining and a logical key hierarchy. The lower level of the architecture consists of the regional coordinators (i. e., substations and distribution systems) and remote ends (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>meters</b> and pole-top sensors) and utilizes a top-down key management approach built on an inverse element method. The proposed key management schema supports the hierarchical structure of the smart grid control mechanisms, and it takes the resource and electronic/physical security differences of the control levels into account. We define a set of protocols utilizing the architecture to provide secure unicast, multicast, and broadcast communications. Furthermore, we illustrate how the architecture is flexible enough to easily handle power grid nodes joining and leaving the system at the different levels.

40|$|Two freeway bottlenecks, {{each with}} a {{distinct}} geometry, have been investigated {{in an effort to}} understand traffic conditions leading to capacity losses (i. e., breakdown). One bottleneck is formed by a horizontal curve and the other by a reduction in travel lanes. These bottlenecks are shown to exhibit breakdowns after queues form immediately upstream. The vehicle accumulations that arise near these bottlenecks are shown to be good proxies for the mechanisms that trigger breakdowns. Evidence is provided to show that these losses can be recovered, postponed or even avoided entirely by controlling the accumulations. An algorithm for estimating vehicle accumulations has been developed in this dissertation. This algorithm? estimates are obtained from the counts made by ordinary detectors (e. g. inductive loops) placed in series. The accumulations estimated are those that arise on the intervening (freeway) segments between the detectors. These estimates can be obtained in real-time at short intervals of a second or so. The systematic errors (i. e., bias) that invariably arise in detector counts are automatically corrected when traffic is freely flowing. The algorithm is thus well suited for monitoring accumulations near a bottleneck prior to capacity drops and the estimates it furnishes can, in turn, dictate control actions (e. <b>g.</b> <b>metering</b> rates) that prolong higher outflows from the bottleneck. The estimates that the algorithm furnishes can also be used for incident detection and delay estimation. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} I comment on our {{findings}} that floral carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{can be used}} by Manduca sexta hawkmoths in a scale- and context-dependent fashion. We firstly found, in wind tunnel assays, that diffusing floral CO 2 is used as long-distance cue (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>meters).</b> Moths track CO 2 plumes up-wind in the same manner they track floral odors. Nevertheless, CO 2 did not appear to function as a local stimulus for flower probing, evidencing a scale-dependent role in nectar foraging. These results were further enriched by a second finding. In dual choice assays, where moths were offered two scented artificial flowers of which only one emitted above-ambient CO 2 -levels, female Manduca sexta chose to feed on the CO 2 emitting flower only when host-plant volatiles were added to the background. We discuss this apparent measurement of oviposition obligations during foraging {{in the context of the}} life histories of both insect and plant species. These findings seem to pinpoint the usually artificial nature of compartmentalizing herbivory and pollination as different, isolated aspects of insect-plant interactions. Insects do not seem to have a defined response to a certain stimulus; instead, motor programs appear to be in response to composite arrangements of external stimuli and inner states. If animal-plant interactions have evolved under these premises, I believe it may prove beneficial to include a non-linear, integrative view of plant multi-signaling and life history aspects into the study of pollination biology...|$|R

40|$|The 'UbÃ¡' mango tree {{cultivar}} is {{very important}} for the juice industry in the "Zona da Mata" region of the Minas Gerais State, in Brazil, but problems such as uneven flowering and low yield have discouraged producers. This study aimed at evaluating the effect of paclobutrazol, combined with branch tip pruning, on the flowering induction and quality of 'UbÃ¡' mango tree fruits. Treatments were distributed in a 5 x 2 + 1 factorial arrangement, consisting of five paclobutrazol doses (0 g, 0. 50 g, 1. 00 g, 1. 50 g and 2. 0 <b>g</b> per linear <b>meter</b> of canopy), with and without branch tip pruning, in a randomized blocks design, with four replicates. The flowering percentage, number of panicles per branch, total flowers per panicle, male/hermaphrodite flowers ratio, number of fruits per branch and fruit quality were evaluated. Plants treated with tip pruning showed a higher flowering percentage. There was an increase in the flowering percentage in response to the paclobutrazol dose, reaching a maximum level at the dose of 1. 62 <b>g</b> per linear <b>meter</b> of canopy. Plants submitted to branch tip pruning had a higher number of panicles per branch. There was an increase in the male/hermaphrodite flowers ratio with increasing paclobutrazol doses. Branch tip pruning increased the number of fruits per branch. There were no differences in fruit quality in response to the paclobutrazol application. It was concluded that the paclobutrazol application at the dose of 1. 62 <b>g</b> per linear <b>meter</b> of canopy, combined with branch tip pruning, increases the flowering of the 'UbÃ¡' mango tree and does not change the fruit quality...|$|R
40|$|AbstractâIn {{recent years}} {{measuring}} instruments have adopted general-purpose operating systems {{to offer the}} user a broader functionality {{that is not necessarily}} restricted towards measure-ment alone.

40|$|The {{construction}} of a wireless multimedia ad-hoc network needs to go across the mixed environment with the indoor, the wall-penetration, and the outdoor condition. This paper presents our contribution to address the system design aspects of a multimedia-enabled network based on IEEE 802. 11 g ad-hoc mode. There are distinct differences between indoor and outdoor environment and penetrating the walls stressed the system limit of the 802. 11 g ad-hoc mode. Therefore, routing decisions should be made intelligently with the environmental respect to maximize the bandwidth support on the end-to-end paths. By investigating the experimental results of the average throughput with the 802. 11 g ad-hoc mode, we have collected the different performance characteristics among the indoor, the wall-penetration and the outdoor environment. Via the experiments and analyses, we have observed that the ad-hoc mode had the worst performance within 5 meters in indoor environments. In outdoor environments, TCP seemed to favor either short distance (e. <b>g.,</b> 5 <b>meters)</b> or long distance (e. <b>g.,</b> 25 <b>meters).</b> On the other hand, the best performance UDP has achieved with the distance of 10 meters. When the wall-penetration occurs, {{it is important that}} the routing nodes in the building edge areas are placed close-by within 5 meters. Given the solid evidences from the baseline experiments, we have embedded the heuristic algorithms into the routing decisions. We have thus simulated a large area of 300 meters by 300 meters with hundreds of routing nodes. After investigating over 100 (randomly-generated) topology scenarios, the performance results indicate that our proposed scheme produces the higher-bandwidth paths for most of the cases. Even in the less-dense cases, our proposed schemes still can find the better paths with bandwidth about 30 % higher than the conventional methods...|$|R
40|$|If a gamma-ray burst (GRB) {{occurs in}} a neutral medium, {{ionizing}} radiation associated with the burst will flash-photoionize a region surrounding the source. Detection of the line emission from this ionized region can constrain the flux of ionizing radiation accompanying the GRB and the density and ionization {{state of the environment}} surrounding the burst source. If the medium is sufficiently dense then the ionized region will recombine and fade on human timescales, aiding in the detection of the burst location and further constraining the density of the medium. However, dust within the dense medium may attenuate the line flux; the burst is unlikely to melt the dust along the line-of-sight. Astronomically interesting flux limits can be established by observations with reasonable integration times on a major telescope (e. <b>g.,</b> 3 <b>meter</b> or larger) ...|$|R
40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} threatens biodiversity by disrupting dispersal. The {{mechanisms and}} consequences of this disruption are controversial, primarily because most organisms are difficult to track. We examined the effect of habitat corridors on long-distance dispersal of seeds by birds, and tested whether small-scale (<b>G</b> 20 <b>meters)</b> movements of birds could be scaled up to predict dispersal of seeds across hundreds of meters in eight experimentally fragmented landscapes. A simulation model accurately predicted the observed pattern of seed rain and revealed that corridors functioned through edge-following behavior of birds. Our study shows how models based on easily observed behaviors can be scaled up to predict landscape-level processes. Habitat fragmentation poses a widespread threat to biodiversity by disrupting the dispersal of organisms (1, 2). Corridorsânarrow strips of habitat that join patches of similar habitatâ are thought to provide a general solution b...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years some very {{interesting}} data relevant to ocean wave backscatter have been produced by non scanning pencil beam radars with high range resolution. These radars are located-on land which overlooks the water/sea surface and operate at low grazing angles (LGA). Prominent among these are the X-band RSRE-Thorn EMI and the LLNL-Hughes real aperture radars employed in the Joint US/UK ocean wave experiments in Loch Linnhe and the Sound of Sleat (Scotland). The range-time image obtained with the RSRE radar is typical of the many images which have been obtained. The most prominent features of these images are linear regions or strips of increased average RCS having temporal durations up to or exceeding 100 seconds. For HH polarization these features are marked by the presence of periodic spikes in RCS. The features appear quite consistent with wave groups which are moving approximately parallel to the radar boresight. A self-consistent model of this wave group behavior, as manifested in the radar images, has been proposed by Tulin. This model provides estimates of the wavelengths involved and accounts for the periodicity of the spiky returns which appear to be due to the passage of nonlinear or incipiently breaking waves through the wave groups. Nothing in this model precludes the presence of multiple wave groups moving at different velocities. In fact, some images exhibit wave groups moving at different velocities, and in some cases both incoming and outgoing wavegroups are present simultaneously. Obviously, X-band Bragg waves cannot explain these features because the lifetime of these waves is, at best, a few seconds. The association of these features with the scattering from the crests of much larger (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>meters)</b> waves is reasonable because the lifetime of these waves is very long. However, it is not reasonable to assume that ambient wavegroups in the field of view of the radar all just happen to be moving along the radar boresight...|$|R
