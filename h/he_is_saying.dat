5|$|After Ashtar escapes {{into the}} Maze of Darkness, Robert tells Ryu about Ashtar's plot {{to take over}} the world by using the full power of his sword, the Dark Sword of Chaos. Robert implores Ryu to stop Ashtar before his Dark Sword reaches full power. After battling through the Maze of Darkness and into the World of Chaos, Ryu hears echoes of Ashtar's plan in the distance. Ryu then catches up with Ashtar. He {{releases}} Irene, but immediately after releasing her he stabs her with the Dark Sword. Robert then shows up, only to find out that Irene has been mortally wounded; Ashtar then blasts Robert with energy from his Dark Sword and then challenges Ryu to battle. Ryu defeats Ashtar, and before he dies, he says that the forces of Darkness will soon awaken and implores the forces of Chaos to engulf the world into darkness. While <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> this, the Dark Sword of Chaos vanishes into thin air. After Ashtar's death, Irene tells Ryu that an evil altar that Ashtar prepared to open the Gate of Darkness must be destroyed. Ryu then leaves Irene behind and tells Robert to take her and leave the World of Chaos.|$|E
25|$|Eden, {{who faced}} {{domestic}} pressure from his party to take action, {{as well as}} stopping the decline of British influence in the Middle East, had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US {{in the wake of}} the Second World War, and had assumed the US would automatically endorse whatever action taken by its closest ally. At the 'Law not War' rally in Trafalgar Square on 4 November 1956, Eden was ridiculed by Aneurin Bevan: 'Sir Anthony Eden has been pretending that he is now invading Egypt to strengthen the United Nations. Every burglar of course could say the same thing; he could argue that he was entering the house to train the police. So, if Sir Anthony Eden is sincere in what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying,</b> and he may be, then he is too stupid to be a prime minister'. Public opinion was mixed; some historians think that the majority of public opinion in the UK was on Eden's side. Eden was forced to bow to American diplomatic and financial pressure, and protests at home, by calling a ceasefire when Anglo-French forces had captured only 23 miles of the Canal. With the US threatening to withdraw financial support from sterling, the Cabinet divided and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Harold Macmillan threatening to resign unless an immediate ceasefire was called, Eden was under immense pressure. He considered defying the calls until the commander on the ground told him it could take up to six days for the Anglo-French troops to secure the entire Canal zone. Therefore, a ceasefire was called at quarter past midnight on 7 November.|$|E
25|$|Callum, who was {{battling for}} custody over Max, {{attacked}} David and the Platt family for months {{until one day}} when, after the Platt's return from a week-long holiday, Sarah Platt was babysitting Max. Whilst they were watching a scary movie, Gemma Winter, Callum's friend, came {{knocking at the door}} of Callum's flat. She had been beaten up by a thug. When Max was playing in his room, he found Callum's gun. Callum threatened Sarah that if she told anyone about the gun then he would release a video of Bethany dealing and taking drugs to the police. Sarah flees with Max, refused to speak to anyone about it and told Bethany to stay away from him. However, he continued threatening the Platts. Sarah confided in Jason Grimshaw to finish him off. He attacked Callum in the Rovers and told him to stay away. He was then arrested for possession of the gun but was released without charge due to lack of evidence. When Callum arrived at the Platts' house to collect Max, David and Jason prevented him. Furious, Callum and two of his thugs lead Jason into the ginnel and beat him up. Sarah found Jason and called an ambulance. Jason's parents Eileen and Tony were told that he might not walk or talk again. Max, who had witnessed the attack on Jason, told David and Kylie what he saw after he appeared terrified when Callum came to collect him. Max gave a statement to the police. Before Callum was arrested, he spiked Sarah's drink and knocked her unconscious. He threatened Bethany that he would kill Sarah if she did not lie for him. The day after, on Lily Platt's 2nd birthday, Bethany revealed to the Platts that she made a statement against Max. The family was disgusted as they knew she was lying. Sarah informed Tony about Callum and the following day, he took matters into his own hands by beating up Callum in the ginnel, only to be stopped by Liz. Callum continued to attack the Platts because he needed money to pay off a dangerous drug dealer. Sarah lures him to the house and records what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying.</b> Callum finds her 'phone and starts attacking Sarah, and Kylie comes in and beats him over the head with a wrench, killing him. They bury his body in a manhole in the garage and Sarah is traumatized.|$|E

During the incident at Centra, he loses his voice in a battle with Esthar soldiers. After being separated from Laguna and Kiros, he becomes a janitor at the D-District Prison. When Laguna becomes president of Esthar, Ward joins Kiros as an advisor, directing affairs with gestures and ellipses. Laguna and Kiros can understand what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> by his reactions. Like Kiros, Ward's interactions with Laguna {{are based on the}} staff's interactions during development.|$|E
500|$|Bach {{composed}} his cantata in 1723 for the Sunday Quinquagesima which Bach knew as , {{the last}} Sunday before Lent. In {{the city of}} Leipzig, tempus clausum was observed during Lent, therefore {{it was the last}} Sunday with a cantata performance before a celebration of the Annunciation, Palm Sunday and the vespers service on Good Friday and Easter. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were taken from the First Epistle to the Corinthians, [...] "praise of love" [...] (...) , and from the Gospel of Luke, healing the blind near Jericho (...) [...] The Gospel also contains the announcement by Jesus of his future suffering in Jerusalem, and that the disciples do not understand what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying.</b>|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} a single crash cymbal {{followed}} by two bars of 4/4 drumming, then a plaintive three-note guitar line rings through a strummy rhythm, and Martin's vocals. Its instrumentation is varied {{with the sound of}} thumping drums, chiming guitars, a singalong chorus, and a string arrangement. The song also features a guitar lick swirl. The three lines of the third verse allude to a man's love of a woman, who does not reciprocate his love. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> he will always wait for her, but he does not think that she should stay where she is any longer. The lyrics emphasize: [...] "But I wait for you/if you go, if you go/leave me down here on my own/then I'll wait for you." [...] The song's lyrics also include references to a desire for weary optimism.|$|E

500|$|According to Posner, [...] "Cardozo's 'bottom line' is {{that there}} is no {{liability}} to an unforeseeable plaintiff". Don Herzog, in his 2017 book, deemed the Palsgraf principle to mean that [...] "if anyone was wronged here, it was the man with the parcel. The guards' wronging him happened to harm Mrs. Palsgraf. But that doesn't mean they wronged Mrs. Palsgraf. And if they didn't wrong her, she can't conceivably prevail in a tort action. Cardozo is not thinking that if he were on the jury, he wouldn't find the railroad liable. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> it was a legal error to let the jury finding stand." [...] This is because [...] "the crucial fact for Cardozo is that the parcel of explosives was unmarked. So reasonably careful conductors worry only that if they make it fall, it will break... They have no reason to worry about the welfare of Mrs. Palsgraf." ...|$|E
500|$|Eccleston {{felt that}} as a {{character}} his Doctor lives solely for the present. He avoids thinking about his past because [...] "there's some pain there" [...] â€“ and his only concern regarding the future is that [...] "it's there". Eccleston felt that the character ultimately provides a life-affirming message stating that [...] "In everything the Doctor does, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> 'it's great to be alive'." [...] In an interview with Newsround he stated that the Doctor accepts individuals regardless of colour and creed and expressed hope that the Doctor would encourage young children to appreciate life. However, he also drew out differences between the Doctor and traditional children's heroes. The actor described the character as [...] "brutal at times" [...] and [...] "confrontational" [...] and [...] "inflexible" [...] stating that he [...] "sometimes creates carnage" [...] and that [...] "there's nobody like him in Disney". Matthew Sweet of The Evening Standard highlighted the dichotomy of the character being [...] "brave and wise and brilliant" [...] but also [...] "rough and ready" [...] and [...] "down-to-earth".|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} {{third of the}} film, Barton speaks {{constantly}} of his desire to write work which centers on and appeals to [...] "the common man". In one speech he declares: [...] "The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of lifeâ€“ [...] why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater? [...] Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? [...] Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater." [...] Yet, despite his rhetoric, Barton is totally unable (or unwilling) to appreciate the humanity of the [...] "common man" [...] living next door to him. Later in the film, Charlie explains that he has brought various horrors upon him because [...] "you DON'T LISTEN!" [...] In his first conversation with Charlie, Barton constantly interrupts Charlie just as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "I could tell you some stories-", demonstrating that despite his fine words he really isn't interested in Charlie's experiences; in another scene, Barton symbolically demonstrates his deafness to the world by stuffing his ears with cotton to block {{the sound of his}} ringing telephone.|$|E

500|$|Whedon uses several disorienting {{effects to}} heighten {{the reality of}} the {{situations}} in the episode {{to the point that they}} seem surreal. The long opening shot of Buffy coming home and finding Joyce was filmed with one hand-held camera in constant movement as she walks through the house to the phone and back to her mother again. The buttons on Buffy's phone are abnormally large, an effect that Whedon added because he experienced it when his mother died. Buffy is so bewildered by the paramedic telling her that Joyce is dead that she can only focus on his mouth in an attempt to understand what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying.</b> The camera uses her perspective and only the bottom part of the paramedic's face is in view. Instead of a normal [...] "over-the-shoulder" [...] view, Buffy is shot at the same height as the paramedic's shoulder, barely squeezed into the frame as if to portray her, according to Whedon, as trapped by reality. Kristine Sutherland stated that the script was [...] "amazing", specifically at capturing the detachment: [...] "It's not something you can process. I mean mortality is just not part of your vocabulary when you're that age." ...|$|E
500|$|When Homer {{is chosen}} by the Republicans to pick their {{candidate}} for the next presidential election, his {{lack of interest in}} the current candidates leads him to choose Ted Nugent. He invites Nugent for a visit to the Simpsons' home, where Lisa complains that Homer has made the wrong pick since Nugent is [...] "out of his mind". Later that day, Homer has a dream in which James Madison shows him how ashamed past American presidents are of Homer. When he wakes up, he tells Lisa he will not be supporting Nugent for president anymore. He then sees a brochure on her dresser with a man posing as a president and offering help with fake dreams. Homer realizes the family faked his dream to convince him not to endorse Nugent. As a result, he angrily decides to go on television and express his support for Nugent. However, when he tries to bring out his ability to cry every time he discusses anything on television, he finds he cannot bring up those emotions because he does not truly believe in what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying.</b> Homer [...] announces on television that he [...] "is full of crap" [...] and [...] reconciles with Lisa. As a result, Nugent is stripped of his position as the Republican presidential candidate. The episode ends as he sings a song about what his presidency would have been like.|$|E
500|$|Buffy studies scholar Roz Kaveney {{states that}} estrangement from {{the self and}} others is the primary theme of the fourth season. To {{illustrate}} the absolute search for identity, the series writers created Adam, who is more truly alone than is anyone else. He is a creature assembled from a man, vampires, demons, and cutting edge cybernetic technology. Adam {{was not the first}} re-animated corpse to be presented in the series. [...] "Some Assembly Required" [...] in the second season also had a Frankenstein monster-like creation and [...] "Beauty and the Beasts" [...] in the third includes references to Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde; both touch on the misuse or abuse of science. Adam is a clear reference to Frankenstein's monster, who in the novel Frankenstein (1818) tells his creator that he is the [...] "Adam of your labours". Mary Shelley wrote the novel to highlight the problems progress, science, and industry create for humanity. Throughout the action, the monster constantly asks what he is and why he was created. Likewise, Adam escapes from 314 and makes his way out into the world, and much like Frankenstein's monster, he finds a little boy and asks the boy who and what he (Adam) is, then murders and dissects him. Adam is a curious character, seeking the truth and pontificating on what he has learned, even if he gained the knowledge through heartless violence. Whedon wanted Adam to be inquisitive and introspective, directing George Hertzberg to [...] "find the stillness" [...] in the character. Roz Kaveney notes that Hertzberg's [...] "flawed but impressive performance" [...] includes Adam's interesting idiosyncrasy of pausing each time he speaks, as if he is creating meaning with his own words and must consider the implications of what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying.</b> Author Nikki Stafford connects Adam's need to learn about the world around him to Frankenstein's monster: Adam must understand why other people are here and why he has emotions, a peculiarity of his creation as Dr. Walsh never encouraged others to question her. One Buffy studies writer draws comparisons between Dr. Walsh and Victor Frankenstein, both of whom build monsters out of body parts [...] "to compensate for human vulnerability". The moral of Shelley's novel is that what science can accomplish is not necessarily what it should.|$|E

2500|$|The {{structure}} of the poem forms an interesting and logical argument and progression. [...] In the first stanza <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> you're too good for me, so I understand {{if you want to}} get rid of me. [...] In the second stanza <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> that I am nowhere close to good enough for you, but maybe you are not aware of it. [...] And in the third stanza <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> you are too good for me, but maybe you didn't realize that before. [...] In the closing couplet, Shakespeare confesses that no matter what the cause of misjudgment, you're released by the mistake, and [...] "I'm left here to remember our time together" [...] when I felt like nobility.|$|E

2500|$|Antonio Costa, {{leader of}} the Socialist Party, called this a grave mistake and added [...] "It is {{unacceptable}} to usurp the exclusive powers of parliament.

[...] The Green politician Rui Tavares commented [...] "The president has created a constitutional crisis. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> that he will never allow {{the formation of a}} government containing Leftists and Communists.

2500|$|For filmmakers to {{do justice}} to the biblical {{accounts}} of the passion, they must complement their artistic vision with sound scholarship, which includes knowledge of how the passion accounts have been used historically to disparage and attack Jews and Judaism. Absent such scholarly and theological understanding, productions such as The Passion could likely falsify history and fuel the animus of those who hate Jews. Rabbi Daniel Lapin, the head of the Toward Tradition organization, criticized this statement, and said of Abraham Foxman, the head of the ADL, [...] "what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> is {{that the only way to}} escape the wrath of Foxman is to repudiate your faith".|$|E
