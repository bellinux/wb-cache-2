The proposed design, as applied in a fullwindshield Head-Up Display system, aims {{to improve the}} driver's situational awareness by considering information as it becomes available from various sources such as incoming mobile phone calls, text and email messages. The vehicle's windshield effectively becomes an interactive display area which allows the system to increase the quality as well as throttle the quantity of <b>information</b> <b>distilled</b> to the driver in typical driving situations by utilising the existing mobile phone network. Opting for a simplistic approach of interaction, the interface elements are based on minimalist visual representation of real objects. This paper discusses the challenges involved in the HUD design, introduces the visual components of the interface and presents {{the outcome of a}} preliminary evaluation of the system on a group of ten users, as performed using a driving simulator.

40|$|Catchment {{hydrologic cycle}} takes on {{different}} patterns across temporal scales. The interim between event-scale hydrologic process and mean annual water-energy correlation pattern requires further examination to justify self-consistent understanding. In this paper, the temporal scale transition revealed by observation and simulation was evaluated in an information theoretical framework named Aleatory Epistemic Uncertainty Estimation. The Aleatory Uncertainty refers to posterior uncertainty of runoff given the input variables’ observations. The Epistemic Uncertainty {{refers to the}} posterior uncertainty increase due to the imperfect observation decoding in models. Daily hydrometeorological observations in 24 catchments were aggregated from 10 days to 1 year before implementing the information analysis. Estimations of information contents and flows of hydrologic terms across temporal scales were related with the catchments’ seasonality type. It also showed that <b>information</b> <b>distilled</b> by the monthly and annual water balance models applied here did not correspond to that provided by observations around temporal scale from two months to half a year. This calls for {{a better understanding of}} seasonal hydrologic mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The present {{demand for}} {{economically}} viable construction {{projects in the}} Saudi Public Sector is coupled {{with the need to}} maximise the efficient use of Saudi Arabian natural resources. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate sustainability in Saudi Arabia in terms of strategies, policies, barriers and enablers associated with its implementation and as perceived by key decision makers. It also endeavours to define sustainable construction principles as currently being applied in the country. The data used in this study were obtained through a review of related literature, reinforced with <b>information</b> <b>distilled</b> from interviews conducted with people working in or possessing significant experience of the Saudi Public Sector. The findings show that the Saudi government has made significant efforts towards protecting the environment by enacting a number of regulations and policies and by joining a number of global conventions over the past few years. However, the lack of consideration paid to sustainable construction principles during the conceptual phase of design has resulted undesirable consumption rates of materials, water and energy during the construction, operating and maintenance phases of projects. Moreover, there currently appears to be are lack of awareness, regulation, policies, information and leaderships with regard to implementation of sustainable construction. Several relevant principles for sustainable construction in terms of environmental, economic and social have been elaborated upon; and enablers that could accelerate its understanding and implementation in the country have been highlighted...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the maximum rates for transmitting quantum <b>information,</b> <b>distilling</b> entanglement, and distributing secret keys between a sender and a receiver in a multipoint communication scenario, {{with the assistance}} of unlimited two-way classical communication involving all parties. First we consider the case where a sender communicates with an arbitrary number of receivers, so called quantum broadcast channel. Here we also provide a simple analysis in the bosonic setting where we consider quantum broadcasting through a sequence of beamsplitters. Then, we consider the opposite case where an arbitrary number of senders communicate with a single receiver, so called quantum multiple-access channel. Finally, we study the general case of all-in-all quantum communication where an arbitrary number of senders communicate with an arbitrary number of receivers. Since our bounds are formulated for quantum systems of arbitrary dimension, they can be applied to many different physical scenarios involving multipoint quantum communication.

40|$|Classroom {{practice}} {{is used in}} this exploratory research to study the dialogue content and process associated with High School art viewing activities. Using content analysis research methods with recorded audio and video data of Art History and Art Critique classroom sessions from five research sites, this study suggests the nature and outcomes of art viewing sessions in schools are widely varied due to differing underlying purposes and goals of the teacher. The teachers implicit and explicit purposes and goals determine what dialogue content, questions, and comments relating to the works of art viewed serve to explicate. Different goals tend to focus the discussion on different issues and interests. Goals identified in this study focused student attention on varied aspects of history, style, artistic expression, artist information, or class assignments. In addition to being driven by individual goals and purposes, teachers used works of art in their viewing sessions to serve different ends. The role actual works played in the viewing art sessions of this research ranged from a superficial inclusion to a complete integration where <b>information</b> <b>distilled</b> from the works constituted the reason for, and the substance of, classroom discussion. Integration distinctions included: the use of art as allusion, as illustration, as example, and as {{the substance of the}} critical talk. Merely exhorting teachers to include or increase talk about art in their teaching {{practice is}} insufficient in determining what that might mean regarding curriculum outcomes. Increasing critical talk about art cannot guarantee that this talk will be moving students toward the same ends. Although teachers may build comparably described sessions into their curricula, they will do so with different goals and purposes in mind. Teachers will be better able to shape the content and determine the outcomes of viewing art activities in schools as they become cognizant of their implicit and explicit purposes and goals, and decide on the role actual works of art will play in their process...|$|E

Operative notes {{contain rich information}} about techniques, instruments, and materials used in surgeries. With widespread electronic health record (EHR) system adoption throughout healthcare, operative reports are increasingly accessible in electronic format and are potential information sources which may be valuable {{for a wide variety}} of secondary functions including new medical knowledge development, decision support, and clinical research. But manual review of large number of reports is time consuming and limits our ability to provide timely evidence-based guide in clinical environment. Automatic extraction of techniques, instruments, materials, and other factors surrounding operative procedures from operative notes can provide an efficient way for physicians to acquire valuable <b>information</b> <b>distilled</b> from diverse experiences reported by clinicians and decide optimal technique approach for patients. To automate the representation and extraction of the rich information from operative notes, the goal of this research is to create domain specific resources needed for creating a semantic role labeling (SRL) system to extract information from operative notes. The coverage of existing domain-specific resources and general English resources for building a SRL system for operative notes were evaluated on a corpus obtained from the Fairview Health Services and the sublanguage used to describe surgical actions in operative notes was investigated. The results from the study show that general English resources are not adequate for building a SRL system for clinical text. Also the study shows some sublanguage characters of operative notes that can be used for parser adaption. Next, an existing unlexicalized probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) parser, the Stanford PCFG parser, was adapted to clinical text for better syntactic parsing performance. Finally, domain specific predicate structure (PAS) frames were created for operative notes, as existing semantic frames for general English are not enough for operative notes. The domain specific resource created in this research can be used to build a SRL system for automatically extracting detailed information from operative notes...|$|E
40|$|After a brief {{description}} of the first Bayesian steps into econometrics in the 1960 s and early 70 s, publication and citation patterns are analyzed in ten major econometric journals until 2012. The results indicate that journals which contain both theoretical and applied papers, such as Journal of Econometrics, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics and Journal of Applied Econometrics, publish the large majority of high quality Bayesian econometric papers in contrast to theoretical journals like Econometrica and the Review of Economic Studies. These latter journals published, however, a few papers that had a substantial impact on Bayesian research. The journals Econometric Reviews and Econometric Theory published key invited papers and special issues that received wide attention, while Marketing Science shows an ever increasing number of papers since the middle n ineties. The International Economic Review and the Review of Economics and Statistics show a moderate time varying increase. The early nineties indicate an upward movement in publication patterns in most journals probably due to the effect of the ‘Computational Revolution'. Next, a visualization technique is used to connect papers and authors around important theoretical and empirical themes such as forecasting, macro models, marketing models, model uncertainty and sampling algorithms. The <b>information</b> <b>distilled</b> from this analysis shows the names of authors who contribute substantially to particular themes. This is followed by a discussion of those topics that pose interesting challenges for discussion amongst Bayesian econometricians, namely the computational revolution, unobserved component and flexible model structures, choice models, IV models, dynamic models and forecasting. Three issues are summarized where Bayesian and frequentist econometricians differ: Identification, the value of prior information and model evaluation; dynamic inference and nonstationarity; and vector autoregressive versus structural modeling. A major topic of debate amongst Bayesian econometricians is listed as objective versus subjective econometrics and communication problems and bridges between statistics and econometrics are summarized. The paper ends with a list of four important themes that will be a challenge for twenty-first century Bayesian econometrics: Sampling methods which are suitable for parallelization and GPU calculations, complex economic models which can account for nonlinearities, analysis of implied model features such as risk and instability and incorporating model incompleteness in econometric analysis...|$|E

When Stewart Kingan began to build his house there, people said it was a bad place to stay. Nothing happened to him. But my brother-in-law also ran into two small pigs one night at the place where they say that thing goes. (M. S., Rarotonga, 4 / 13 / 76) The aim of this short paper is to propose the “ghost story ” or “spirit account” as a particularly lively, continuously creative area of the Cook Islands ’ oral tradition that would repay more detailed study along a number of different lines. The data presented here as an introduction to the topic are in no way comprehensive. They represent <b>information</b> <b>distilled</b> from approximately fi fty accounts, from full stories to fragmentary comments given in both English and Cook Island Maori. These accounts, from some thirty different informants, were mainly gathered during anthropological fi eldwork on other topics in 1976 - 77, some during a briefer visit in 1983.

40|$|This paper {{starts with}} a brief {{description}} of the introduction of the likelihood approach in econometrics as presented in Cowles Foundation Monographs 10 and 14. A sketch is given of the criticisms on this approach mainly from the first group of Bayesian econometricians. Publication and citation patterns of Bayesian econometric papers are analyzed in ten major econometric journals from the late 1970 s until the first few months of 2014. Results indicate a cluster of journals with theoretical and applied papers, mainly consisting of Journal of Econometrics, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics and Journal of Applied Econometrics which contains the large majority of high quality Bayesian econometric papers. A second cluster of theoretical journals, mainly consisting of Econometrica and Review of Economic Studies contains few Bayesian econometric papers. The scientific impact, however, of these few papers on Bayesian econometric research is substantial. Special issues from the journals Econometric Reviews, Journal of Econometrics and Econometric Theory received wide attention. Marketing Science shows an ever increasing number of Bayesian papers since the middle nineties. The International Economic Review and the Review of Economics and Statistics show a moderate time varying increase. An upward movement in publication patterns in most journals occurs in the early 1990 s due to the effect of the ‘Computational Revolution’. The paper continues using a visualization technique to connect papers and authors around important empirical subjects such as forecasting in macro models and finance, choice and equilibrium in micro models and marketing, and around more methodological subjects as model uncertainty and sampling algorithms. The <b>information</b> <b>distilled</b> from this analysis shows names of authors who contribute substantially to particular subjects. Next, subjects are discussed where Bayesian econometrics has shown substantial advances, namely, implementing stochastic simulation methods due to the computational revolution; flexible and unobserved component model structures in macroeconomics and finance; hierarchical structures and choice models in microeconomics and marketing. Three issues are summarized where Bayesian and frequentist econometricians differ: Identification, the value of prior information and model evaluation; dynamic inference and nonstationarity; vector autoregressive versus structural modeling. A topic of debate amongst Bayesian econometricians is listed as objective versus subjective econometrics. Communication problems and bridges between statistics and econometrics are summarized.
