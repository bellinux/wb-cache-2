40|$|Progressive {{shifts of}} <b>holding</b> <b>potential</b> (Vh) in {{crayfish}} giant axons, from - 140 to - 70 mV, reduce gating currents seen in depolarizing steps (to 0 mV test potential) while proportionately increasing gating currents in hyperpolarizing steps (to - 240 mV). The resulting sigmoid equilibrium charge distribution (Q-Vh curve) shows an effective valence of 1. 9 e and a midpoint of - 100 mV. By contrast, Q-V curves obtained using hyperpolarizing and/or depolarizing steps {{from a single}} <b>holding</b> <b>potential,</b> change their "shape" depending on the chosen <b>holding</b> <b>potential.</b> For <b>holding</b> <b>potentials</b> at the negative end of the Q-Vh distribution (e. g., - 140 mV), negligible charge moves in hyperpolarizing pulses and the Q-V curve can be characterized entirely from depolarizing voltage steps. The slope of the resulting simple sigmoid Q-V curve also indicates an effective valence of 1. 9 e. When the axon is held at less negative potentials significant charge moves in hyperpolarizing voltage steps. The component of the Q-V curve collected using hyperpolarizing pulses shows a significantly reduced slope (approximately 0. 75 e) by comparison with the 1. 9 e slope found using depolarizing pulses or from the Q-Vh curve. As <b>holding</b> <b>potential</b> is shifted in the depolarizing direction along the Q-Vh curve, an increasing fraction of total charge movement must be assessed in hyperpolarizing voltage steps. Thus charge moving in the low slope component of the Q-V curve increases as <b>holding</b> <b>potential</b> is depolarized, while charge moving with high apparent valence decreases proportionately. Additional results, together with simulations based on a simple kinetic model, suggest that the reduced apparent valence of the low slope component of the Q-V curve results from gating charge immobilization occurring at <b>holding</b> <b>potential.</b> Immobilization selectively retards that fraction of total charge moving in hyperpolarizing pulses. Misleading conclusions, as to the number and valence of the gating particles, may therefore be derived from Q-V curves obtained by other than depolarizing pulses from negative saturated <b>holding</b> <b>potentials...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe channel {{underlying}} the slow {{component of the}} voltage-dependent delayed outward rectifier K+ current, IKs, in heart is composed of the minK and KvLQT 1 proteins. Expression of the minK protein in Xenopus oocytes results in IKs-like currents, IsK, due to coassembly with the endogenous XKvLQT 1. The kinetics and voltage-dependent characteristics of IsK suggest a distinct mechanism for voltage-dependent gating.

40|$|Two voltage-dependent inward {{currents}} in the fresh-water hypotrichous ciliate Stylonychia mytilus have been investigated, using two intracellular micro-electrodes, when either Ca ions or Ba ions are the charge carriers. In cells bathed in Ca-free Ba solution the two inward currents, named current I and current II, {{could be identified}} and studied {{in the absence of}} outward currents. The two inward currents could also be separated by addition of the plant lectin concanavalin A (0. 5 microgram/ml) to the external medium, which resulted in the selective inhibition of current I. When the <b>holding</b> <b>potential</b> was set at values between - 45 and - 65 mV (normal resting potential is - 50 mV), current I was shifted parallel to the <b>holding</b> <b>potential</b> along the voltage axis. This shift was 7. 6 mV per 10 mV change in <b>holding</b> <b>potential.</b> The amplitude and voltage relationship of current II was not affected by these changes in the <b>holding</b> <b>potential.</b> The amplitude of current I in Ba solution was maximal when the membrane potential was held at - 55 mV; it decreased with higher and lower <b>holding</b> <b>potentials.</b> The rate of activation of current I remained virtually unaffected at <b>holding</b> <b>potentials</b> between - 45 and - 60 mV, and was somewhat reduced at a <b>holding</b> <b>potential</b> of - 65 mV. When the extracellular Ca concentration was varied between 0. 1 and 5. 0 mM, or when the cells were loaded with EGTA to reduce the intracellular level of ionized Ca, the resting membrane potential and the voltage relationships of both current I and II and of the outward current were shifted along the voltage axis according to the expected changes in membrane surface potential. Double-pulse experiments with varying interval potentials suggested voltage-dependent inactivation of current I and Ca-dependent inactivation of current II. Pre-hyperpolarizing steps of only 1 mV amplitude and 30 ms duration could result in the activation of current I, indicating that the activation voltage of current I closely followed the actual membrane potential. Hence, the same voltage steps elicited similar current I amplitudes with <b>holding</b> <b>potentials</b> between - 45 and - 60 mV. The results indicate that current II displays voltage properties described for Ca channels in other ciliates and many multicellular preparations, while current I shows an unusual voltage behaviour, which might be regarded as an 'adaptive type of excitation'.

Under physiological conditions, however, both forms of plasticity are likely to be co-induced. In this report we study the two types of plasticity together in an experimentally advantageous preparation (the mollusc Aplysia californica). Somewhat surprisingly we find that effects of <b>holding</b> <b>potential</b> can be relatively modest when presynaptic neurons are activated at low frequencies. Interestingly, however, changes in membrane potential are highly effective when homosynaptic facilitation is induced. In this situation PSPs facilitate at an increased rate. To summarize, our research suggests a novel view of the effect of <b>holding</b> <b>potential</b> on synaptic transmission. We propose that under physiological conditions it modifies the dynamics of homosynaptic facilitation...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} {{the relationships between the}} modulation of transmitter release and of specific ionic currents by membrane potential in the cholinergic interneuron L 10 of the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia californica. The presynaptic cell body was voltage-clamped under various pharmacological conditions and transmitter release from the terminals was assayed simultaneously by recording the synaptic potentials in the postsynaptic cell. When cell L 10 was voltage-clamped from a <b>holding</b> <b>potential</b> of - 60 mV in the presence of tetrodotoxin, graded transmitter release was evoked by depolarizing command pulses in the membrane voltage range (- 35 mV to + 10 mV) in which the Ca 2 + current was also increasing. Depolarizing the <b>holding</b> <b>potential</b> of L 10 results in increased transmitter output. Two ionic mechanisms contribute to this form of plasticity. First, depolarization inactivates some K+ channels so that depolarizing command pulses recruit a smaller K+ current. In unclamped cells the decreased K+ conductance causes spike-broadening and increased influx of Ca 2 + during each spike. Second, small depolarizations around resting potential (- 55 mV to - 35 mV) activate a steady-state Ca 2 + current that also contributes to the modulation of transmitter release, because, even with most presynaptic K+ currents blocked pharmacologically, depolarizing the <b>holding</b> <b>potential</b> still increases transmitter release. In contrast to the steady-state Ca 2 + current, the transient inward Ca 2 + current evoked by depolarizing clamp steps is relatively unchanged from various <b>holding</b> <b>potentials...</b>|$|R
