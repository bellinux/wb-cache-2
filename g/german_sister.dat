5000|$|The <b>German</b> <b>sister</b> {{publication}} LinuxUser 10/2012 reviewed Calligra 2.5 on [...] Its reception {{was mostly}} positive.

[...] The reviewer Thomas Drilling {{on the other}} hand praised Calligra's usability, writing: [...] "The consistent work flow, often stunningly intuitive workflows, and clear menu structure are well received." [...] He then concluded: [...] "The individual modules' quality varies: While Words shows weakness, image editor Krita, spreadsheet application Sheets, and presentation program Stage completely won us over.

5000|$|Despite {{continuing}} political rivalry, {{after the}} death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, at first imperceptibly, cold war tensions between the two parts of Germany became less acute, or at least slightly less unmanageable. 1968 saw the creation in West Germany of the German Communist Party. The name was different, but only slightly. Much {{the same could be said}} for the politics, the close links to the Soviet sponsored East <b>German</b> <b>sister</b> party, and the party membership. But the [...] "new" [...] party was not banned. Otto Niebergall joined in 1968, becoming in 1971 a member of the regional party executive in Rhineland-Palatinate, and becoming head of the new party's History Commission. In or before 1971 he relocated from east to west for the last time, again making his home in Mainz. However, by now he was for most purposes retired.

5000|$|After {{the novel}} had been republished in the US in 1988 Kirkus Reviews wasn't overly impressed: [...] "In The Acolyte (1972), a failed {{engineer}} and two <b>German</b> <b>sisters</b> devote themselves, body and soul, {{to the whims}} of an egotistical blind composer. The author uses great care in dissecting the minutest variations in their orgies of self-sacrifice, but she neglects to show what it is that draws them to destruction. All three are willing doormats from the start. As a result, there is a good deal of truth in Astley's observations but very little interest. Nor are matters helped any by an ostentatiously prickly style." ...|$|R
