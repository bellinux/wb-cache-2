50|$|An {{attacker}} who steals {{a certificate}} authority's private keys {{is able to}} forge certificates as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were <b>CA,</b> without needed ongoing access to the CA's systems. Key theft is therefore {{one of the main}} risks certificate authorities defend against. Publicly trusted CAs almost always store their keys on a hardware security module (HSM), which allows them to sign certificates with a key, but generally prevent extraction of that key with both physical and software controls. CAs typically take the further precaution of keeping the key for their long-term root certificates in an HSM that is kept offline, except when it is needed to sign shorter-lived intermediate certificates. The intermediate certificates, stored in an online HSM, can do the day-to-day work of signing end-entity certificates and keeping revocation information up to date.|$|R
