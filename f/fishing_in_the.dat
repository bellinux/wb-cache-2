5|$|Big Wapwallopen Creek {{is named}} after a Native American village on the Susquehanna River near the creek. The Delaware and Shawnee tribes {{historically}} had camps and wigwams on the creek. The Delaware tribe was hunting and <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of the creek's watershed as early as 1675.|$|E
5|$|In 1251, the sheriffs {{were ordered}} to pay fourpence a day towards the upkeep for the King's polar bear, a gift from Haakon IV of Norway in the same year; the bear {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} attention from Londoners when it went <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Thames while tied to the land by a chain.|$|E
5|$|The main {{occupation}} of Nagapattinam is <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> waters of Bay of Bengal. The fish {{are sold in}} the daily and weekly fish markets in the town.

50|$|<b>The</b> largest <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family, {{the greater}} amberjack, Seriola dumerili, grows up to 2 m <b>in</b> length; most <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family reach a maximum length of 25-100 cm.|$|R
50|$|The herring scad {{is one of}} five extant species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scad genus Alepes, a {{group of}} <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jack family, Carangidae. The Carangidae are perciform <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{suborder}} Percoidei.|$|R
5000|$|Sander (formerly {{known as}} Stizostedion) is a genus of <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Percidae (perch) family. They are {{also known as}} [...] "pike-perch" [...] because of their {{resemblance}} to <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unrelated Esocidae (pike) family.|$|R
5|$|However, Henry's army never progressed {{further than}} Leith; there the army could keep in {{physical}} {{contact with the}} supporting fleet. Henry took a personal interest in his convoys, at one point even verbally instructing that two Scottish fishermen <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Firth of Forth were to be paid £2 for their (unspecified) assistance. However, Henry never besieged Edinburgh Castle where the Duke of Rothsay was ensconced. By now, Brown says, Henry's campaign {{had been reduced to}} a 'war of words.' By 29 August, the English army had returned {{to the other side of}} the border.|$|E
5|$|The Kettle Creek Path {{used by the}} Native Americans {{historically}} {{linked the}} Cowanesque River with the West Branch Susquehanna River via Kettle Creek. It is possible that Native Americans camped on the creek while hunting and <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. An Indian village existed {{at the mouth of}} the creek until it was destroyed by the military in 1763. In 1784, at the Treaty at Fort Stanwick, much of Pennsylvania's Northern Tier, including the Kettle Creek watershed, was purchased from the Iroquois, Delaware, and Wyandott for $7000. The Indians retained hunting rights in the area until 1804.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavations}} of the tel {{has revealed}} a small settlement, {{the only one}} of that period in eastern Arabia, on its northern side. It has been inferred that the village was settled by people who developed agriculture near the oasis, planted palm trees, tended cattle, sheep and goats and also ventured into <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arabian Sea. The small houses they built were made of rough stone with clay or mortar as binding material. The plastered floors in the houses were said to have been spacious. Excavations also hinted that the village had streets which separated the housing complexes.|$|E
50|$|The giant conch is preyed upon by invertebrates, such as octopi. It is also prey of vertebrates, {{including}} rays (genera {{and species}} of cartilaginous <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family Myliobatidae), triggerﬁsh (family Balistidae), and snappers (perciform <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family Lutjanidae).|$|R

5|$|The {{intertidal}} mud flats {{of the bay}} have a {{long history}} of use for fishing, with structures on Stert Flats being dated by dendrochronological analysis to between 932 and 966. It is the last site in England used for 'mudhorse fishing' in which a wooden sledge is propelled across the mudflats to collect fish from nets. Catches include: Thinlip mullet, plaice, dogfish, cuttlefish, skate, shrimp, prawns, sea bass, and sole. Watchet Boat Museum displays the unusual local flatner boats which were used for <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bay, along with associated artefacts.|$|E
5|$|A hunchback {{fisherman}} finds a {{young girl}} tied to a mast, the sole survivor of a shipwreck, and raises her into womanhood {{with the intention of}} making her his wife. Ten years pass and the woman, out of gratitude, promises to marry him. The hunchback hires a handsome stranger, the boy. The boy and the girl fall in love, but the girl refuses to marry him. The hunchback sees the two embrace and threatens the boy with a knife. The next day, the three go <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boat and an argument breaks out. During the argument the boat tips over and the girl is washed away. The hunchback and the boy search for her, until the boy becomes exhausted and collapses on the shore. The hunchback finds the girl on a rock and brings her ashore. As the two reunite, he sees how happy they are together and takes his leave.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt {{created the}} Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge (HINWR), which {{is under the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Throughout the 1980s, the National Marine Fisheries Service completed various versions of an Environmental Impact Statement that designated the Northwest Hawaiian Islands as a critical habitat for the Hawaiian monk seal. The designation prohibited lobster <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northwest Hawaiian Islands and Laysan Island. In 2006, a Presidential Proclamation established the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, which incorporated the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, and the Battle of Midway National Memorial, thus creating the largest marine protected area in the world and affording the Hawaiian monk seal further protection.|$|E

5|$|The English cloth {{industry}} grew considerably at {{the start}} of the 15th century, and a new class of international English merchant emerged, typically based in London or the South-West, prospering at the expense of the older, shrinking economies of the eastern towns. These new trading systems brought about the end of many of the international fairs and the rise of the chartered company. <b>Fishing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Sea expanded into deeper waters, backed by commercial investment from major merchants. Between 1440 and 1480, however, Europe entered a recession and England suffered the Great Slump: trade collapsed, driving down agricultural prices, rents and ultimately the acceptable levels of royal taxation. The resulting tensions and discontent played an important part in Jack Cade's popular uprising in 1450 and the subsequent Wars of the Roses. By the end of Middle Ages the economy had begun to recover and considerable improvements were being made in metalworking and shipbuilding that would shape the Early Modern economy.|$|E
5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} is not aggressive, {{though it}} will defend itself if stepped on or otherwise incited. Its tail spine can inflict an excruciating injury, and can easily pierce leather or rubber footwear. The paralytic venom delivered may have potentially life-threatening effects on those with heart or respiratory problems, and {{is the subject of}} biomedical and neurobiological research. This species is popular with ecotourist divers. Abundant and widespread, the bluntnose stingray is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries operating in nearshore U.S. waters; these activities are not a threat to its population, as most captured rays are released alive. The impact of <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern parts of its range is uncertain, but is unlikely to significantly affect the species as a whole as these activities occur outside its centers of distribution. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the bluntnose stingray as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|While {{the initial}} lease with Darlington {{confined}} {{the park to}} between the railroad and the north bank of the Loyalhanna Creek, permission was later granted for construction of a bridge across the river, allowing expansion to {{the south in the}} mid-1880s. Three lakes, Woodland, St. Clair, and Bouquet, were dug between 1880 and 1896. In 1896, the park added a T.M. Harton Company steam carousel {{in the center of the}} park. The Pittsburgh-based company was a major manufacturer of carousels and roller coasters. By the end of the 19th century, attractions at the park included a bicycle track around Lake Bouquet, a hiking trail on the lake's island, <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Loyalhanna Creek, rowboating, and many walks and gardens. The park had dining halls, auditoriums, pavilions, a boathouse, an amphitheater, a bandstand, and athletic facilities.|$|E
