500|$|Christopher Cooper, head of Cavity Search Records (which {{released}} Roman Candle), {{said about}} this time in Smith's life, [...] "I talked him out of thinking {{that he wanted to}} kill himself numerous times when he was in Portland. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> him that he was a brilliant man, and that life was worth living, and that people loved him." [...] Pete Krebs also agreed: [...] "In Portland we got the brunt of Elliott's initial depression... Lots of people have stories of their own experiences of staying up with Elliott 'til five in the morning, holding his hand, telling him not to kill himself." ...|$|E
500|$|Kills {{revealed}} to Elle that the songwriting process for [...] "Saturday Night" [...] was difficult, {{as she had}} to confront memories and feelings. She further explained that, to her, {{it felt like a}} [...] "confession". This song was deemed by Kills as her life's soundtrack: [...] "When I was almost 14, I left home, got a job, and thought I {{was going to be a}} big TV star. I was determined to prove myself. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> myself, 'I'm going to be fine,' even when I wasn't—especially when I didn't even believe it. The song is about carrying on, even though you feel like you can't. It's about feeling OK when everything is not." [...] She later reiterated those sentiments with website Digital Spy, and stated that it would show people what she truly was and what she had gone through over the years.|$|E
2500|$|The Egypt Independent {{reported}} that police forces dragged a protester, stripped him naked, {{beat him up}} with batons, {{and took him to}} a security truck. The incident sparked criticism against the administration of Morsi for tolerating the security force's excessive use of force. The presidency said it [...] "was pained by the shocking footage of some policemen treating a protester in a manner that does not accord with human dignity and human rights." [...] State television {{reported that}} the 48-year-old beaten man, from a police hospital and without a lawyer present, said that the police had in fact saved him from thieving protesters. The man's daughter, who says she was present {{at the scene of the}} attack, said that her father is simply [...] "afraid to talk", while his nephew said [...] "he is lying because there is a lot of pressure on him." [...] In new twist, Hamada Saber finally retracted his earlier testimony: [...] "I told [...] today that [...] shot me in the leg, beat me and dragged me," [...] he said. [...] "When I resisted, they tore off my shirt. After I resisted some more, they tore off my pants and underpants. They kept telling me to stand up and <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> them I was injured". [...] "Now my family has disowned me; my wife and kids won't talk to me. The whole country is angry at me for ," [...] Saber added.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} Star Wars trilogy {{is considered}} one of the best film trilogies in history. Lucas has often stated that the entire trilogy was intended to be considered one film. However, he said that his story material for Star Wars was too long for a single film, prompting Lucas to split the story into multiple films. Lucas also stated that the story evolved over time and that [...] "There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now ... As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them ... <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> taking out all the good parts, and <b>I</b> just <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> myself <b>I</b> would make other movies someday." [...] In early interviews, it was suggested the series might comprise nine or twelve films.|$|R
5000|$|Eddie Murphy was the {{original}} choice {{for the role of}} Candyman, but the filmmakers could not afford him. [...] According to Todd, [...] "I met with Bernard Rose, who's a brilliant mind and a great director, and I wanted to say it was a hire. But <b>I</b> just... People <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> me, 'Oh you'll never be able to shake this,' and I said, 'You know, I'm gonna do the best I can and go away from that.' I knew when I read it, and I saw the bees and the stuff, I knew things like that haven't been filmed before, so that was interesting. And I've always wanted to find my own personal Phantom of the Opera." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{pulled the}} two quills with sharp jerks {{out of my}} hand, pushed all the others through my coat sleeve, and turned to Unk Wunk again, sucking my wounded hand, which pained me intensely. [...] "All your own fault," [...] <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> myself, to keep from whacking him across the nose, his one {{vulnerable}} point, with my stick.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile I {{had been}} long expostulating with my friend upon a {{different}} matter. [...] "I'm the fifth wheel," [...] <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> him. [...] "For any use I am, I {{might as well be}} in Senegambia. The letters you give me to attend to might be answered by a sucking child. And I tell you what it is, Pinkerton; either you've got to find me some employment, or I'll have to start in and find it for myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{never had}} before," [...] Mr. Weatherley went on. [...] "It really seems quite amazing that that one blow {{right on the}} head should have done it. He lay there quite still {{afterwards}} {{and it made me}} sick to look at him. All the time, though, <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> on <b>telling</b> myself that if I had not been there he would have hurt Fenella. That kept me quite cool. Afterwards, I put the club carefully back in the case, pushed him a little under the sofa, and then I stopped to think for a moment. I was quite clever, Chetwode. The window was open through which the man had come, so I locked the door on the inside, stepped out of the window, came in at the front door with my latchkey, crept upstairs, undressed quickly and got into bed. The funny part of it all was, Chetwode," [...] he concluded, [...] "that nobody ever really found the body." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{was not at}} all in the humour of the tourist. I had wasted {{weeks of}} time and {{accomplished}} nothing; we were {{on the eve of the}} engagement, and I had neither plans nor allies. I had thrust myself into the trade of private providence, and amateur detective; I was spending money and I was reaping disgrace. All the time <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> myself that I must at least speak; that this ignominious silence should have been broken long ago, and must be broken now. I should have broken it when he first proposed to come to Stallbridge-Minster; I should have broken it in the train; I should break it there and then, on the inn doorstep, as the omnibus rolled off. I turned toward him at the thought; he seemed to wince, the words died on my lips, and I proposed instead that we should visit the Minster.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] cried Ralph, [...] "you do {{not know}} what a lively couple there is out there. I found that my sister and Mrs. Cliff had made up their minds that they would perish in about two days, and Mrs. Cliff had been making her will with a lead-pencil, and now they are just as high up as they were low down before. They would not let me come to get them some water, though <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> them they never tasted {{anything}} like it in their whole lives, because they wanted to hear everything about everything. My sister will be wild to come to this lake before long, even if Mrs. Cliff does not care to try it. And when you are ready to come to them, and bring Maka, they want to know who that other colored man is, and how Maka happened to find him. I truly believe their curiosity goes ahead of their thirst." [...] And so saying he went down to the lake to fill a pail he had brought with him.|$|E

5000|$|I {{was about}} 7 {{years old when}} I started reading comics called 'Amar Chitra Katha' that are {{published}} in India. They're not about a superhero, but they encompass all the stories of India, the folklore, the mythology, everything. But most of these stories are about Indian historical figures.

5000|$|All {{the songs}} on the new album (the first since 2001) are all new, {{according}} to Josh T. Pearson. [...] "The {{last couple of years}} I got sober and started working again with a little more discipline. Before I was writing all the time but never finishing," [...] he told Q magazine. If there was any pressure at first for a new material, {{in a couple of years}} it was gone: I disappeared for a while, I needed to get out of Texas, get on the road, see some of the world. I don't like being told what to do, <b>I</b> guess. People <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> me <b>I</b> had to put out an album. I only want to put out a good record and if you put out a good record it comes with a cost. It'll demand more things from you than you're willing to give. I haven't seen a dime from the Lift... records in eight years at least, so it wasn't like a constant reminder that people were still interested. The album, recorded in [...] "cold, cold Berlin", came as a result of a relationship he described as [...] "pretty heartbreaking" [...] and was difficult to create. [...] "I went grey overnight... It was one of the most painful times of my life. I can't listen to it. I haven't listened to it since we've finished it", he said. For a while Pearson thought the album shouldn't be released at all, so painful was the feel. [...] "It's why people go to a priest - so no one else hears you. But playing songs live seemed to help people. I don't know if it's a big mistake, but it's coming out now. Maybe it can do some good," [...] he said.|$|R
