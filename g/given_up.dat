5|$|Adopted {{children}} are children that were <b>given</b> <b>up</b> at birth, abandoned or {{were unable to}} be cared for by their biological parents. They may have been put into foster care before finding their permanent residence. It is particularly hard for adopted children to get adopted from foster care: 50,000 children were adopted in 2001. The average age of these children was 7, which shows that fewer older children were adopted.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} alkali metals, lithium {{has a single}} valence {{electron}} that is easily <b>given</b> <b>up</b> to form a cation.

Lithium's low reactivity is due to the proximity of its valence electron to its nucleus (the remaining two electrons are in the 1s orbital, much lower in energy, and do not participate in chemical bonds).|$|E
