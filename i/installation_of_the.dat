5|$|During the Early Classic, cities {{throughout}} the Maya region {{were influenced by}} the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico. In AD 378, Teotihuacan decisively intervened at Tikal and other nearby cities, deposed their rulers, and installed a new Teotihuacan-backed dynasty. This intervention was led by Siyaj K'ak' ("Born of Fire"), who arrived at Tikal in early 378. The king of Tikal, Chak Tok Ich'aak I, died on the same day, suggesting a violent takeover. A year later, Siyaj K'ak' oversaw the installation of a new king, Yax Nuun Ahiin I. The <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new dynasty led to a period of political dominance when Tikal became the most powerful city in the central lowlands.|$|E
