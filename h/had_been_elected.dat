At fifty-one, Albani was younger than any other pope who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>elected</b> in almost two centuries.

The so-called Western Schism subsequently caused a great {{crisis in the}} Church and created rivalry and conflict throughout Christian Europe.

5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} the Dutch East Indies in 1942, Soeman {{was made a}} school supervisor by occupying forces. He soon became involved in politics, being elected to the Shūsangikai, a Japanese-sponsored regional representatives' council, for Riau. He later recalled that, because he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>elected</b> rather than selected by the Japanese forces—and thus had strong backing among the community, {{which could be used}} for revolution—he had felt as though he was under constant surveillance. This situation continued until after the Japanese withdrew from Indonesia and Sukarno proclaimed an independent Indonesia.|$|E

The Achaean army of 20,000 {{infantry}} and 1,000 cavalry advanced on the 5,000-strong Spartan army at Pallantium. Aratus, who had accompanied Aristomachos, advised him to retreat because even 20,000 Achaeans were no match for 5,000 Spartans. Aristomachos, listening to Aratus' advice, retreated with the Achaean army.|$|E

5|$|The Democratic {{party was}} badly divided over the parimutuel betting issue {{as well as}} prohibition, and a {{severance}} tax on coal. The prohibitionist and anti-gambling faction of the Democratic Party—with the help of Louisville Courier-Journal editor Robert Worth Bingham—united to make former governor and senator J. C. W. Beckham the party's gubernatorial nominee. Following Beckham's nomination, many pro-gambling and anti-prohibition Democrats hurried to the support of Sampson. Sitting Democratic governor William J. Fields, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>elected</b> {{with help from the}} Jockey Club, was very passive in the campaign and refused to support Beckham.|$|E

5|$|The Jockey Club ran a {{candidate}} in both parties' primary elections. In the Democratic primary Beckham defeated the Club's relatively obscure candidate, Robert T. Crowe. Flem D. Sampson, the Club's nominee in the Republican primary, won his party's nomination. In the general election Beckham could not secure the support of Democratic governor William J. Fields, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>elected</b> {{with the help of}} the Jockey Club. Despite the Democrats winning every other contest on the ballot, including the race for lieutenant governor, Beckham lost to Sampson by more than 32,000 votes. It was estimated that the Club spent over $500,000 to defeat him.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{freshman}} class of 1910 brought new hope to the reformers. Fourteen of the thirty newly elected senators <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>elected</b> through party primaries, which amounted to popular choice in their states. More {{than half of}} the states had some form of primary selection for the Senate. The Senate finally joined the House to submit the Seventeenth Amendment to the states for ratification, nearly ninety years after it first was presented to the Senate in 1826.|$|E

The Liberals won five consecutive majorities between 1935 and 1953. The Liberals worked closely with the civil service (drawing several of their ministers from those ranks) and their years of dominance saw prosperity.|$|E
