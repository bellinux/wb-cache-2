5000|$|Magazine Street: former Explosives Magazine and <b>Detonator</b> <b>Store</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The former Explosives Magazine and <b>Detonator</b> <b>Store</b> {{was listed}} on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having {{satisfied}} the following criteria.|$|E
50|$|The <b>detonator</b> <b>store</b> {{is about}} 1.8m square and 2.4m high. The {{door into the}} shed {{is located in the}} south elevation. The {{interior}} is lined with sheeting.|$|E
5000|$|A {{detonator}} {{contains an}} easy-to-ignite primary explosive {{that provides the}} initial activation energy to start the detonation in the main charge. Explosives commonly used in detonators include mercury fulminate, lead azide, lead styphnate and tetryl and DDNP. Blasting caps and some <b>detonators</b> are <b>stored</b> separately and not inserted into the main explosive charge until just before use, keeping the main charge safe. Early blasting caps also used silver fulminate {{but it has been}} replaced with cheaper and safer primary explosives.Silver azide is still used sometimes,but very rarely due to its high price.|$|R
5000|$|The {{place is}} {{important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a substantial, early 1900s explosives magazine and <b>detonator</b> <b>store</b> constructed in concrete, and illustrates [...] techniques for the ventilation of explosives magazines.|$|E
50|$|Explosives Magazine and <b>Detonator</b> <b>Store</b> is a heritage-listed former {{gunpowder}} magazine at Magazine Street, Stratford, Cairns, Cairns Region, Queensland, Australia. It {{was built}} in 1901 by JC Thomson. It {{was added to the}} Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.|$|E
50|$|The former Explosives Magazine and <b>Detonator</b> <b>Store</b> at Stratford is {{important}} in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history, being {{closely associated with the}} economic development of the Cairns hinterland {{in the early decades of}} the 20th century, and in particular with the expansion of railways and mining in the district.|$|E
50|$|The powder {{magazine}} and <b>detonator</b> <b>store</b> at Stratford, near Cairns, were constructed in 1901 for Queensland Government's Marine Department, {{which was the}} government authority responsible for storing the large quantity of explosives, both government and privately owned, being shipped into the port of Cairns {{at the turn of}} the century.|$|E
50|$|These three sheds {{are joined}} {{to form a}} single {{composite}} structure. All have skillion roofs. They consist of the fuel shed, a wooden framed, corrugated iron shed; the pipe rack storage cage, an open sided structure with a corrugated iron roof; and the <b>detonator</b> <b>store,</b> a small weatherboard shed elevated on short stumps.|$|E
50|$|Designs for {{a powder}} {{magazine}} and <b>detonator</b> <b>store,</b> brick with concrete foundations, {{along with a}} small timber residence for the magazine keeper, were produced by the Queensland Government Architect's office, and the contract was let to JC Thomson in November 1900. During construction, mass concrete was substituted for brick walls, in consequence of which costs were reduced. The buildings were completed in mid-July 1901, {{at a cost of}} Â£2,471.|$|E
50|$|The {{magazine}} provided {{storage capacity}} for over 6,000 cases of explosives, and {{was described in}} the Works Department's Annual Report for 1901-02 as containing means of ventilation, lighting, and other provision for safety, {{in advance of the}} best structures hitherto erected in Queensland for this particular purpose. Ventilation in the main magazine was supplied by roof ventilators and airholes covered by grates in the thick concrete walls, and the timber floor was built 3 feet above ground to allow air to circulate beneath. The explosives magazine and <b>detonator</b> <b>store</b> were surrounded by a high fence of galvanised iron, and the reserve was fenced with hardwood posts and rails. In addition, the Railways Department had constructed a loop line and siding to the magazine.|$|E
