25|$|A major {{influence}} on modern spirituality was the Theosophical Society, which searched for 'secret teachings' in Asian religions. It has been influential on modernist streams in several Asian religions, notably Neo-Vedanta, {{the revival of}} Theravada Buddhism, and Buddhist modernism, which have taken over modern western notions of personal experience and universalism and integrated them in their religious concepts. A second, related influence was Anthroposophy, whose founder, Rudolf Steiner, was particularly interested in developing a genuine Western spirituality, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> such a spirituality could transform practical institutions such as education, agriculture, and medicine.|$|E
25|$|Although the Roman Catholic propagandists did {{put forth}} some {{effective}} propaganda campaigns, primarily {{the campaign against}} Luther regarding the Peasants War, they neglected to get their message across to the general public. They failed to capitalize <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> the Protestant propagandists were able to; they did not commonly produce works in the vernacular of the people, which had been an effective tactic for Protestants. Also Roman Catholic publications, either in German or Latin, produced during the reformation years were greatly outnumbered by the Protestants. The sheer volume of Protestant publications {{made it impossible for}} the Roman Catholic propagandists to quell the Protestant ideas and doctrine that transformed religious thought and doctrine in the sixteenth century.|$|E

500|$|By {{the second}} {{decade of the}} 21st century, {{analogue}} recording was being replaced by digital recording and all forms of electronic entertainment began to converge. For example, convergence is challenging standard practices in the film industry: whereas [...] "success or failure used {{to be determined by}} the first weekend of its run. Today,... a series of exhibition 'windows', such as DVD, pay-per-view, and fibre-optic video-on-demand are used to maximise profits." [...] Part of the industry's adjustment is its release of new commercial product directly via video hosting services. Media convergence is said to be more than technological: the convergence is cultural as well. It is also [...] "the result of a deliberate effort to protect the interests of business entities, policy institutions and other groups". Globalisation and cultural imperialism are two of the cultural consequences of convergence. Others include fandom and interactive storytelling as well as the way that single franchises are distributed through and affect a range of delivery methods. The [...] "greater diversity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> signals may be received and packaged for the viewer, via terrestrial, satellite or cable television, and of course, via the Internet" [...] also affects entertainment venues, such as sports stadia, which now need to be designed so that both live and remote audiences can interact in increasingly sophisticated ways for example, audiences can [...] "watch highlights, call up statistics", [...] "order tickets and merchandise" [...] and generally [...] "tap into the stadium's resources at any time of the day or night".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} the first Hollywood {{production}} to be filmed with the Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED Epic camera and was shot in 3-D at 5K resolution. Cinematographer John Schwartzman {{had this to say}} about the camera: [...] "Today was Epic, Monday December 6 marks the first day the Red Epic camera was used to shoot a major studio motion picture. I can say for certainty the camera does exist and boy is it ready for primetime, as a matter of fact it's a true game changer." [...] Schwartzman felt that the 3D would have been impossible without it. He said, [...] "I can tell you without these cameras it would be impossible to move a 3D rig <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> THIS story demands, if Jim and the crew hadn't made these cameras available to us I don't think we could have shot this movie the way our director envisioned it in 3D." [...] Webb wanted cameras small enough to fit on the rigs and swing around very fast, saying that the [...] "RED Epic cameras were the right cameras to do that." [...] Webb continued that [...] "you need to shoot it with a level of velocity and 3D cameras can be very large... and so we need those cameras to mount on rigs that could fly to the air and run to the streets in a certain pace. That allowed us to do it." [...] The Amazing Spider-Man climax was filmed in a 1:78:1 aspect ratio for its IMAX DMR release.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{temporary}} undivided supportive {{attention from}} another person often {{gives rise to}} strong feelings, apparently towards that person, typically of [...] "falling in love" [...] with them. This {{is similar to the}} phenomenon of transference, particularly when one of the partners is felt to have more authority because, for instance, they are more experienced, are teachers of co-counselling, or have authority roles within the organisation. The organisations differ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> they handle this. [...] The inability to trust and feel in real relationships is often exacerbated by the pseudo-intimacy of co-counseling, making transference more likely and more dangerous.|$|E
2500|$|When evangelical pastor Ted Haggard {{resigned}} from church leadership after a sex scandal involving a male escort, Driscoll provoked an uproar {{with a comment}} on his blog: [...] "A wife who lets herself go and is not sexually available to her husband <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> the Song of Songs is so frank about is not responsible for her husband's sin, but {{she may not be}} helping him either." [...] Driscoll later apologized for his statement, stating that he did not intend for his comment to reflect on Haggard's wife personally. After the incident, the Seattle Times discontinued Driscoll as one of its religion columnists.|$|E

2500|$|Abbott's {{ideas about}} New York were highly {{influenced}} by Lewis Mumford's historical writings {{from the early}} 1930s, which divided American history {{into a series of}} technological eras. [...] Abbott, like Mumford, was particularly critical of America's [...] "paleotechnic era," [...] which, as he described it, emerged at end of the American Civil War, a development called by other historians the Second Industrial Revolution. [...] Like Mumford, Abbott was hopeful that, through urban planning efforts (aided by her photographs), Americans would be able to wrest control of their cities from paleotechnic forces, and bring about what Mumford described as a more humane and human-scaled, [...] "neotechnic era". [...] Abbott's agreement with Mumford can be seen especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> she photographed buildings that had been constructed in the paleotechnic era—before the advent of urban planning. [...] Most often, buildings from this era appear in Abbott's photographs in compositions that made them look downright menacing.|$|E
2500|$|Peer support {{can occur}} within, outside or around {{traditional}} {{mental health services}} and programs, between two people or in groups. Peer support is a key concept in the recovery approach and in consumer-operated services programs. Consumers/clients of mental health programs have also formed non-profit self-help organizations, and serve to support {{each other and to}} challenge associated stigma and discrimination. The role of peer workers in mental health services {{was the subject of a}} conference in London in April 2012, jointly organized by the Centre for Mental Health and the NHS Confederation. Research has shown that peer-run self-help groups yield improvement in psychiatric symptoms resulting in decreased hospitalization, larger social support networks and enhanced self-esteem and social functioning. There is considerable variety <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> peer support is defined and conceptualized as it relates to mental health services. [...] In some cases, clinicians, psychiatrists, and other staff who do not necessarily have their own experiences of receiving psychiatric treatment are being trained, often by psychiatric survivors, in peer support as an approach to building relationships that genuine, mutual, and non-coercive.|$|E

40|$|One way {{in which}} law protects dignity is by {{enforcing}} human rights provisions that explictly or implicitly involve the protection of dignity or the prevention of degradation. But law 2 ̆ 7 s connection with dignity is also much deeper and more pervasive than this. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it operates, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it presents its requirements, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> law expects its requirements to be taken on baord and observed by those to whom the requirements are primarily addressed, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> procedural <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it organizes hearings, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it sponsors argumentation, even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it arranages for coercion [...] in all these ways, law treats humans as dignified agents, capable of self-control, {{with a sense of}} themsleves and their interests, and with the ability to respond intelligently and thoughtfully to its demands. These ideas, which originate with some comments by Lon Fuller, in 2 ̆ 2 The Morality of Law, 2 ̆ 2 are developed extensively <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present paper. Of course it is true that law is sometimes brutal and degrading in its application; but the paper argues that it is part of law 2 ̆ 7 s inherently aspirational character to deal with human persons as dignified agents, and that this distinguishes legal forms of control from other modes of governance...|$|R
