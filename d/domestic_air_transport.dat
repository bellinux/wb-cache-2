40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} geographic patterns of <b>domestic</b> <b>air</b> passenger <b>transport</b> in China from 1980 to 1998, with three foci: (1) impacts of economic reforms, (2) regional inequality in <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> development, and (3) network development. Accessibility to <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> improved significantly as China expanded its <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> system, 1980 - 1998. The dominance of major airports declined as the <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> system expanded {{to medium and}} small cities. The centroid of passenger volume migrated toward southeast, consistent with the expansion of economic growth in southeast coastal areas. The rule of distance decay in air traffic was more applicable to China in 1998 than in 1985 as the market economy worked its way into China's <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> system. The East Region had a much higher share of air passengers {{than its share of}} population and GDP, followed by the West and the Middle Regions, reflecting an interesting "flyover" effect.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Reg Ansett was {{expanding}} {{the operations of}} his company, Ansett Transport Industries (ATI), in the Australian domestic aviation market. Ansett wanted to acquire Arthur Butler's company, Butler <b>Air</b> <b>Transport,</b> but Butler refused a deal {{that would have given}} Butler a seat on ATI's board. Ansett had already acquired a 40 percent interest in Butler <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> when he had purchased the ailing Australian National Airways in 1957. Reg Ansett, in what one author described as [...] "a spectacular initiative", then used nine of his own aircraft to fly Ansett nominee shareholders to a Butler <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> meeting, taking over the company from Arthur Butler. After a legal battle, Ansett gained full control of Butler <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> in 1958. The company was renamed as Airlines of New South Wales on 17 December 1959, and flew its first commercial flight on 19 December that year. The airline operated services from Sydney to regional New South Wales centres, and later to other Australian cities. In 1964, Airlines of New South Wales was a subsidiary of Ansett Transport Industries. In 1968 or 1969 it was renamed Ansett Airlines of New South Wales, which {{at the time of the}} Australian government's 1978 <b>Domestic</b> <b>Air</b> Policy <b>Transport</b> Review was one of five regional airlines operating in Australia. In 1981 the airline was renamed Air New South Wales; in March 1990 it was renamed Ansett NSW and later that year it was again re-badged as Ansett Express, which in 1993 was merged into Ansett, ending Airlines of New South Wales' history as a separate entity.|$|R

50|$|The airline was {{established}} on 20 September 1991 and began operations on 3 December 1993 with two Boeing 737-200 aircraft as Sahara Airlines, {{as part of}} the major Sahara India Pariwar business conglomerate. Initially services were primarily concentrated in the northern sectors of India, keeping Delhi as its base, and then operations were extended to cover all the country. Sahara Airlines was rebranded as Air Sahara on 2 October 2000, although Sahara Airlines remains the carrier's registered name. On 22 March 2004 it became an international carrier with the start of flights from Chennai to Colombo, later expanding to London, Singapore, Maldives and Kathmandu. It had also planned to become the first private Indian carrier to serve China with flights to Guangzhou from winter 2006, however this did not materialize.

40|$|In the <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> {{industry}} in Chile there exists free entry, {{there is no}} fare regulation, {{and the role of}} government is defined as one of minimum intervention. However, the evolution of the industry over the last year has prompted public concern and debate about the degree of competition in the <b>domestic</b> passenger <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> markest, especially in routes where there is only one airline. Several of the current public policy concerns in Chile have been already the focus in the economic literature since the deregulation in the U. S. during the late 70 s and the interest has increased lately as a result of many mergers and alliances among airlines. The theretical and empirical research has largely contributed {{to a better understanding of}} the specific characteristics of the air tranport industry and the main factors affecting competition in these markest. For this reason, a literature review can shed light on the relevant issues to be considered in the analysis and implementation of public policies in this industry. The main goal of this study is to review the economic literature on <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> and bring up the critical issues that should be considered in the analysis of anticompetitive risks and the degree of competition in this industry. An analysis of these critical issue would allow not only future research about the effects on competition of the current <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> policies but would also allow to evaluate the implementation of public policies to increase the degree of competition in the domestic markets...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Domestic</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> grew in China at 15.5 percent {{annually}} from 2001 to 2006.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the Government of India and its two {{airlines}} {{became aware of}} the increasing number of potential air travellers in many small towns around the nation. Vayudoot was started to expand India's <b>domestic</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> network on a very large scale, with a completely new network designed to feed Indian Airlines' network at state capitals and other big cities. hence all Vayudoot destinations (apart from its hubs) were completely new, not covered by existing Indian Airlines services.Vayudoot began operations on January 26, 1981, India's Republic Day, in the remote north-east of the country, linking towns in states such as Assam, Manipur and Tripura. A journey such as one from Lilabari (North Lakhimpur) in Assam state to Ziro in the neighbouring state of Arunachal Pradesh could take a few days during inclement weather, braving hazards such as avalanches in the hills and flooding in lower lying areas. The flight, on the other hand was as short as 12 minutes, though weather could cause disruptions because this was flying where visual contact had to be maintained with the ground/terrain in the absence of reliable aids for navigation. The weather caused poor visibility on account of heavy rains and low clouds and/or fog and could at times result in waterlogged runways. Many runways were unpaved or dirt strips and facilities at these airports were very limited.|$|E

The ten-year period immediately following deregulation was also examined; this period was characterised by relatively large numbers of market entries and exits. A database was obtained from the Airports Company South Africa; air traffic movements, passenger numbers and load factors were evaluated. The study showed that the market is still characterised by regular market entries and exits. Also that the entry of the low-cost carriers has stimulated the market, resulting in increased air traffic movements, higher passenger numbers, higher load factors in general and the opening of a secondary airport in Gauteng, Lanseria International.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{to estimate the}} average airlines operational costs and airports charges per route is important for airlines companies trying to open new routes and for data generation for other purpose such as transport modeling, simulation modeling, investment analyses for airlines and airports, etc. In this paper, a {{mathematical model}} is proposed for calculating airline operations costs and airports charges on a certain route by a specific airline. This model {{was set up by}} analyzing the <b>domestic</b> US <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> market. A multi-regression analysis determined the relation between distance, airline operations costs and airports charges between origin and destination and market fares. The model calculates the average airlines operations costs and airports charges per route by using these costs as parameters to estimates airlines routes fares. Thus, Airlines and airports cost factors are estimated by least square method between real fares data per route and the proposed model estimations. The results have been validated comparing with real airlines operations costs data showing a correlation over 99 %, meaning that the average airlines operational costs and airports charges per route can be estimated by the model using real fares data and also that route fares are mainly determined by airline operations costs and airport charges.

A route choice probability model is applied to show how Haneda’s hub competitive position in its connecting markets from Japan has changed since the resumption of these services. The results reveal that Haneda’s market shares increased significantly in the markets between Japan and Asia-Oceania, between Japan and Europe and between Japan and North America. The dense domestic networks offered at Haneda appear to connect well with the newly started international flights to Asia-Oceania, Europe and North America.
