25|$|The typical and usual {{segments}} of the insect leg are divided into the coxa, one trochanter, the femur, the tibia, the tarsus, and the pretarsus. The coxa in its more symmetrical form, has {{the shape of a}} short cylinder or truncate cone, though commonly it is ovate and may be almost spherical. The proximal end of the coxa is girdled by a submarginal basicostal suture that forms internally a ridge, or basicosta, and sets off a marginal flange, the coxomarginale, or basicoxite. The basicosta strengthens the base of the coxa and is commonly enlarged on the outer wall to give insertion to muscles; on the mesal half of the coxa, however, it is usually weak and often confluent with the coxal margin. The trochanteral muscles that take their origin in the coxa are always attached distal to the basicosta. The coxa is attached to the body by an articular membrane, the coxal corium, which surrounds its base. These two articulations are perhaps the primary dorsal and ventral articular points of the subcoxo-coxal hinge. In addition, the insect coxa has often an anterior articulation with the anterior, ventral end of the trochantin, but the trochantinal articulation does not coexist with a sternal articulation. The pleural articular surface of the coxa is borne on a mesal inflection of the coxal wall. If the coxa is movable on the pleural articulation alone, the coxal articular surface is usually inflected to a sufficient depth to give a leverage to the abductor muscles inserted on the outer rim of the coxal base. Distally the coxa bears an anterior and a posterior articulation with the trochanter. The outer wall of the coxa is often marked by a suture extending from the base to the anterior trochanteral articulation. In some insects the coxal suture falls in line with the pleural suture, and in such cases the coxa appears to be divided into two parts corresponding to the episternum and <b>epimeron</b> of the pleuron. The coxal suture is absent in many insects.|$|E

40|$|A {{new species}} of the deep-sea {{scavenging}} genus Hirondellea (Crustacea: Amphipoda) is described from bathyal depths in the Azores region and on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

Psammonyx tzvetkovae is similar to both Wecomedon similis Jarret and Bousfield, 1982 and P. kurilicus (Gurjanova, 1962). However, it differs from W. similis in having shorter interantennal lobe, more oblique palm of gnathopod 1 and different length of articles 5 and 6 of gnathopod 2. Psammonyx tzvetkovae is distinguished from P. kurilicus in having eyes, {{the absence of a}} saddlelike depression on urosomit 1, the shape and armament of article 6 of gnathopods 1 and 2, the absence of a "pineapple pad" on article 5 of gnathopod 2 and other characters.

40|$|Wings were a {{fundamental}} morphological innovation for the adaptive radiation of insects, the most diversified group among all animals. Pterygote insects have {{two pairs of}} wings, the mesothoracic (T 2) forewings and the metathoracic (T 3) hindwings, whereas the prothorax (T 1) is wingless. Using RNA interference approaches, {{we have found that}} the gene Sex combs reduced (Scr) determines the wingless identity of T 1 in the cockroach Blattella germanica. Interference of Scr triggers the formation of ectopic wing structures in T 1, which are formed from the expansion of the latero-posterior region of the pronotum, along with a contribution of the <b>epimeron,</b> a pleurite of T 1. These data support the theory of a dual origin for insect wings, from pronotal (tergal origin theory) and pleural (pleural origin theory) structures and genes.
