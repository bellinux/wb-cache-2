5000|$|Anníe first {{appeared}} in the sport of CrossFit in July 2009, when she traveled from Reykjavik to Aromas, California to compete at the third annual CrossFit Games. She had been taking [...] "bootcamp" [...] classes but had only a month of CrossFit experience. Anníe finished five of the eight events within the top 10 (out of 70 competitors), including an event win on the Sandbag Sprint (1:07.4) and fourth-place finishes on the Sledge <b>Hammer</b> <b>Drive</b> (5:56) and the Triplet (86). On the final day of competition, an event called [...] "The Chipper" [...] was announced that included ring muscle-ups. With no exposure to this men's gymnastics movement, Anníe attempted to learn the movement before going out on the competition floor with the help of coaches and fellow athletes to no avail. On the competition floor, Anníe completed the 15 cleans (100-lb.), 30 toes-to-bar, and 30 box jumps (20 inches) before reaching the 15 muscle-ups. She attempted the muscle-up many times unsuccessfully before finally getting one rep in front of the cheering crowds. She earned a DNF on the event, and dropped in the overall standings to 11th, but made herself known as a contender for the title of [...] "Fittest on Earth." ...|$|E

50|$|Steam and {{mechanical}} power hammers were made {{into the middle}} of the 20th century in the United States. At the end of the 19th century the mechanical power hammer became popular in smaller blacksmith and repair shops. These machines were typically rated between 25 and 500 pounds of falling weight. Many may still be seen in use in small manufacturing and artist-blacksmith shops today. In the middle of the 20th century power <b>hammers</b> <b>driven</b> by compressed air began to gain popularity and several manufacturers are currently producing these hammers today.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to fully electropneumatic marker designs, electronic trigger frames, with a solenoid-controlled sear, can be fit to most mechanical [...] "blow-back" [...] designs, {{such as the}} Kingman Spyder line of entry-level markers. These allow the high rates of fire seen in full electropneumatic designs at a very low cost compared to higher-level markers; however they typically have both the higher recoil of poppets (even worse, typically, as the designs use a traditional high-mass <b>hammer</b> <b>driven</b> forward by a spring) and relatively low gas efficiency due to a single operating pressure.|$|R

An apparatus was created to allow direct electromagnetic excitation of 24 strings, producing very different timbres and dynamic envelopes than the conventional <b>hammer</b> <b>driven</b> piano string offers. The spectral piano may simultaneously and uniquely address any spectral component of each excited string. The ability to bend pitch, shimmer, pulse, and simultaneously create multiple pitches and timbres is possible.

It hung [...] above the street in a specially built tower on the building's roof. Hung on December 23, 1926, the bell was first rung on New Year's Eve of that year. The bell is rung every hour, except on Sundays. The bell was originally intended to swing in the tower on top of One South Broad, but the swinging of the bell shook the building.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Defining the inelastic {{behavior}} of nail joints {{is essential in}} the development of a rational design procedure of wood-stud walls. Prediction equations were developed for the {{inelastic behavior}} of joints commonly found in wood-stud walls. The equations relate three elastic moduli that define the average inelastic joint stiffness to the material properties of the wall coverings, studs and nails. The equations were verified experimentally on joints between Douglas-fir studs and 3 / 8 -inch plywood sheathing. Experiments also showed that the stiffness of machine pushed nail joints was less variable than that of their <b>hammer</b> <b>driven</b> mates, and that increased nail head size produced stiffer joints. Furthermore, joints tested at faster loading rates were stiffer than their mates tested at slower rates...|$|R

The effect of <b>hammer</b> <b>driven</b> piles installation were studied using laboratory scale model. Three main effects were studied in which they are the response on top and bottom of a building, the vibration creates by three different distances of driven pile and the vibration produced by two different pile sizes.

However, it is interesting to note that the smaller pile creates larger vibrations...|$|R
