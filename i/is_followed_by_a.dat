5|$|The first {{movement}} {{follows the}} standard {{outline of a}} sonata form concerto movement of the Classical period. It begins with an orchestral exposition, which <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> solo exposition, a development section, a recapitulation, a cadenza and a coda. Within this conventional outline, Mozart engages in extensive structural innovation.|$|E

5|$|A distant, mournful fanfare (A), {{played on}} a cornet {{representing}} a bugle, <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> brisk military march initiated by a duet for side drum and piccolo (B). A passage for brass precedes {{the introduction of a}} theme or leitmotif associated with the phantom Kijé which, after a reprise of the march and a C major crescendo, is repeated on tenor saxophone, an instrument relatively new to the orchestra at that time. The cornet fanfare then returns to close the movement.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, {{beginning with}} a biblical quotation for the vox Christi, Jesus speaking. A set of aria and recitative <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> chorus on another biblical quotation from the gospel, while an aria leads to the closing chorale. Bach scored the work for three vocal soloists (alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo. The duration of the cantata is given as 20 minutes.|$|E

A final section, which was in fact composed first, chronicles the Six Ages of the World based mainly on Bede. Claudius expends much effort in dating the events of the Old Testament according to the Christian calendar.|$|E
5|$|Crossing the Back Rivers by {{a series}} of {{low-level}} bridges is the Northern Outfall Sewer which leads to the Abbey Mill Pumping Station, both of which were designed by Joseph Bazalgette in the 1860s.

5|$|Since all PID bytes include four 0bits, {{they leave}} the bus in the full-bandwidth Kstate, {{which is the same}} as the low-bandwidth Jstate. It <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> brief pause, during which hubs enable their low-bandwidth outputs, already idling in the Jstate. Then a low-bandwidth packet follows, {{beginning}} with a sync sequence and PID byte, and ending with a brief period of SE0. Full-bandwidth devices other than hubs can simply ignore the PRE packet and its low-bandwidth contents, until the final SE0 indicates that a new packet follows.|$|E

5|$|The scheme, {{consisting}} of a sequence of characters beginning with a letter and followed by any combination of letters, digits, plus (+), period (.), or hyphen (-). Although schemes are case-insensitive, the canonical form is lowercase and documents that specify schemes must do so with lowercase letters. It <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> colon (:). Examples of popular schemes include http(s), ftp, mailto, file, data, and irc. URI schemes should be registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), although non-registered schemes are used in practice.|$|E

5|$|When this {{prayer is}} finished, the choir sings an English {{translation}} of the traditional Latin antiphon Confortare: Be strong and of a good courage; keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways. During the singing of this antiphon, all stand in their places, and the monarch remains seated in the Coronation Chair still wearing the crown and holding the sceptres. The recitation of this antiphon <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> rite of benediction consisting of several prayers.|$|E
5|$|Dunga {{anonymously}} reveals to Kika {{that her}} husband is cheating on her, thinking that if he can destroy their marriage, then he and Wellington can become lovers. Kika finds Wellington and Dayse together, attacks them, and then leaves for good. Wellington goes to the Texas Hotel to seek solace. Dunga wants to take Wellington up to his room, but Wellington is {{put off by the}} funeral of the recently deceased owner of the hotel. Meanwhile, Isaac is thrown out of the bar after trying to forcibly grab Lígia. He is then seen driving his car and when he meets Kika, he takes her to his apartment and they have sex. As the film concludes, Lígia is shown again complaining about her routine. This <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> montage of everyday city life, ending with Kika deciding to dye her hair the same shade that made Isaac so attracted to Lígia.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium was {{discovered}} {{as a component}} of the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Albert Einstein. Its most common isotope einsteinium-253 (half-life 20.47 days) is produced artificially from decay of californium-253 in a few dedicated high-power nuclear reactors with a total yield on the order of one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but at much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside basic scientific research. In particular, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element mendelevium in 1955.|$|E

5|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is {{a spectrum of}} conditions caused by infection with the human {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience {{a brief period of}} influenza-like illness. Typically, this <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also associated with weight loss.|$|E
5|$|In early {{drafts of}} Final Fantasy VII, Tifa {{was to be}} a {{background}} character. Her role in AVALANCHE was to add support behind the scenes, and to cheer everyone up after missions, as well as having a particular fondness for Cloud. She was also supposed to have a large scar on her back caused by Cloud, and partial amnesia from the incident when she had received it. A scene intended to imply herself and Cloud having sex was proposed by Masato Kato, one of the event planners, but it was replaced with a toned down version by Kitase in which a risqué line <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> fade to black. In an interview Nojima stated that none of the staff thought the scene would become such an issue at the time.|$|E
5|$|It is the {{prerogative}} of the monarch to summon and prorogue Parliament. Each parliamentary session {{begins with the}} monarch's summons. The new parliamentary session is marked by the State Opening of Parliament, during which the Sovereign reads the Speech from the throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords, outlining the Government's legislative agenda. Prorogation usually occurs about one year after a session begins, and formally concludes the session. Dissolution ends a parliamentary term, and <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> general election for all seats in the House of Commons. A general election is normally held {{five years after the}} previous one under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, but can be held sooner if the Prime Minister loses a motion of confidence, or if two-thirds {{of the members of the}} House of Commons vote to hold an early election.|$|E
