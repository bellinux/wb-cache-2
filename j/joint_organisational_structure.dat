40|$|<b>Organisational</b> <b>structure</b> {{has been}} {{assessed}} with various different scales resulting in inconsistencies in {{the measures of}} this construct. Hence, a re-conceptualisation of the <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> construct is crucial {{due to the fact}} that researchers have thus far provided inconclusive agreement on what dimensions should be included in measuring <b>organisational</b> <b>structure,</b> although many studies have conceptualized <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> as a multidimensional construct. This study attempted to examine the psychometric properties of the <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> construct by integrating four subscales – decision making, hierarchy of authority, job codification, and rule observation. A priori proposition was made that <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> measurement could be explained by four of the hypothesised dimensions. SPSS version 12 and AMOS 4 were used to analyse the data. Findings supported the hypothesis that <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> can be measured by the four aforementioned subscales. Findings also showed acceptable internal consistency reliability for the overall and the four specific subscales of <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> latent construct...|$|R

This modelling perspective identifies <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> occurring in complex decentralised processes and handles complexity of the analysis of {{the dynamics}} by structuring these dynamics according to an <b>organisational</b> <b>structure.</b> More specifically, dynamic properties at different levels of aggregation in the <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> are identified, and related to each other according to the <b>organisational</b> <b>structure.</b> The applicability of this organisational modelling approach to address complexity in biological context is illustrated by a case study: the organisation of intracellular processes...|$|R
40|$|Flexible <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> is characterised by the {{creation}} of temporary teams within a basic departmental structure to solve a particular difficult task, important for the organisation and limited by time. It can be stated on its grounds that team work {{is the basis of}} innovative organisation operation. However, fact that organisations most often use individuals and not {{the creation}} of a team specialised in the given issue in solving of new, important and demanding projects and tasks sounds negative. If organisations want to create so called innovative environment, it is necessary to focus on <b>organisational</b> <b>structure,</b> while it is necessary to realise that different <b>organisational</b> <b>structures</b> are appropriate for different types of organisations. Presumption which was the basis of our analysis of <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> flexibility was the fact that organisational flexibility results from its ability to respond to changing conditions and new situations. Therefore, we monitored the frequency of characteristics like adaptation of <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> to changing conditions and delegation of operational decisions to line managers. However, the research implied that only a smaller part of <b>organisational</b> <b>structures</b> of the analysed organisations fulfils this characteristics. Stanisław Borkowsk...|$|R

40|$|According to the {{convergence}} hypothesis, different economies {{are bound to}} converge to one supposedly superior system under the uniformating pressure of globalisation. Consequently, also <b>organisational</b> <b>structures</b> converge. Contrary to what {{the convergence}} hypothesis maintains, globalisation does not originate nor requires the convergence to a unique, best economic system and <b>organisational</b> <b>structure.</b> This is so because {{of the features of}} globalisation and the microstructure of the economic system. The economic system is the basic co-ordination device that bounds economic actors, addresses their efforts and constrains their expectations with respect to economic interaction. In this way the system defines advantages and gains and disadvantages and costs of different <b>organisational</b> <b>structures.</b> These gains and costs determine those <b>organisational</b> <b>structures</b> that are most efficacious in any context formed by particular environmental and individual features...|$|R
40|$|Housing {{companies}} {{manage a}} considerable proportion of urban open green space in Sweden. This article explores how 62 Swedish housing companies, municipal and private, organise their open space maintenance {{and the reasons}} behind <b>organisational</b> <b>structure.</b> Here, <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> covers three aspects of open space maintenance: (1) whether performed in-house or by a contractor, (2) whether performed by local managers or circulating teams, and (3) whether and how residents are involved in management. The <b>organisational</b> <b>structures</b> varied widely among the housing companies studied. Mixed structures were common. Formal resident involvement processes were almost only found in municipally owned areas with local managers. The arguments could be derived from two general management approaches, prioritising either customer relations more or economic effi ciency. The conclusion was that management approach might be important in choosing <b>organisational</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} role leadership style and <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> play in <b>organisational</b> effectiveness. Organisational effectiveness {{is one of}} the more complex terms to define although essential to understand in order for an organisation to grow and develop. A small to medium wine sales and distribution organisation, its leadership style and <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> were chosen as a focus of this case study. Organisational effectiveness in this study is understood by the terms growth and development using the Greiner Theory of Evolution and Revolution (1983). The literature explores the role of leadership style in organisational effectiveness by exploring various theories and focusing on The Full Range Leadership Model by Bass and Avolio (1994). In order to analyse the role of <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> in <b>organisational</b> effectiveness, the different forms of <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> and the role they have on the organisation’s ability to grow and develop are explored. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the role leadership style and <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> play in <b>organisational</b> effectiveness. A qualitative content analysis paradigm was used with a Case Study method. The data was gathered using structured interviews conducted on all 39 permanent staff members, day to day observation and the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ). The MLQ is used as a supporting tool to verify the leadership findings in the interviews. The data was analysed using NVivo 10 and STATISTICA to gain insight into the leadership style and <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> of the organisation. The findings reflected that certain themes were repeatedly mentioned in the interviews and the definition of <b>organisational</b> effectiveness: <b>structured</b> leadership, more active leadership, lack of communication, staff motivation, staff training and development and organisational culture. As regards <b>organisational</b> <b>structure,</b> the following themes arose: The need for regular meetings, increased team work and more structured job descriptions. Through the analysis of all the components, leadership style and <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> were identified as having a significant role in organisational effectiveness which will be further analysed in this study...|$|R

This thesis {{deals with the}} monistic <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> in Czech legal system. The {{possibility}} of choosing the one-tier system {{was given to the}} Czech joint-stock companies thanks to recodification of private law, under which, effective as at 1. 1. 2014, was adopted The Business Corporation Act. However, implementation of this obligatory option was not without difficulties. The legislator had chosen inconvenient solution when, unlike in the foreign jurisdiction, there are obligatory constituted two organs. Such a conception, based on links on the dualistic system, creates many interpretation difficulties. In the beginning of this thesis, I introduce internal <b>organisational</b> <b>structures</b> in the view of broader framework of corporate governance. Further, I characterize various <b>organisational</b> <b>structures,</b> classify them and point out their differences. The main focus is on the third chapter. First, I describe the development of the Czech legislation until present state. Flowingly, I characterize the Czech one-tier system, and then I analyse the organs that are in monistic <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> constituted.

40|$|There is an age long {{interest}} that the strategic management literature requires {{a better understanding}} of how the structure and strategy of an organisation influence its corporate performance. This standing interest increases the number of studies on structure-strategy-performance trilogy, but yet the outcomes are inconclusive. This paper examines how <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> and strategies influence organisation’s corporate performance, and investigate whether <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> has a moderating impact on the association between organisational performance and strategy. This is achieved by undertaking a Meta-analysis of literature on strategic management and explores the elements of <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> with respect to strategies and corporate performance. Based on the identified dimensions in literature, a questionnaire survey approach was adopted to obtain quantitative data from large construction organisations in South Africa. The data were analysed using correlation and regression analysis. The results revealed that <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> has an explanatory effect on the relationship between strategy and organisational corporate performance. The study provides {{a better understanding of}} the relationship between <b>organisational</b> <b>structure,</b> strategies and performance. It will also contribute to current discuss on the strategic planning practices in the global construction environment...|$|R

40|$|Leaders of organisations {{are faced}} with a challenging, rapidly {{changing}} business environment that results in increasing complexities. To deal with these complex environments the matrix structure, even though problematic, is often cited as the preferred structure to leverage from the efficient information flow. <b>Organisational</b> <b>structure</b> should facilitate strategy implementation and {{is often referred to as}} strategy-structure paradigm. The concept of <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> has been extensively researched. However there exists a gap in determining and relating the factors that influence the flow of information through <b>organisational</b> <b>structure.</b> Therefore further research into <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> is needed. This study contributed to the field of <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> by comparing matrix structure with hierarchical structure in an effort to determine the impact on evidence-based decision making. The research method adopted for this study was a quantitative cross-sectional study. Data was collected through a self-administered questionnaire that was adapted from constructs presented in the literature review. The questionnaire was distributed employing convenience and snowballing sampling which resulted in 189 responses from 16 diverse industry sectors. The pertinent findings of the study were that <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> has no impact on evidence-based decision making when comparing matrix organisations to hierarchical organisations. The comparison revealed that there is no significant relationship regarding information flow and evidence-based cultures. The study found that organisational culture is the main driver of evidence-based decision making.
