5|$|Of all the alkaloids, only <b>galantamine</b> {{has made}} it to {{therapeutic}} use in man, as the drug <b>galantamine</b> for Alzheimer's disease. <b>Galantamine</b> is an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor which crosses the blood brain barrier and is active within the central nervous system. Daffodils are grown commercially near Brecon in Powys, Wales, to produce <b>galantamine,</b> a drug used to combat Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
5|$|Acetylcholine {{esterase}} inhibition {{has attracted}} the most interest {{as a possible}} therapeutic intervention, with activity varying by a thousandfold between species, and the greatest activity seen in those that contain <b>galantamine</b> or epinorgalanthamine.|$|E
5|$|Five {{medications}} {{are currently}} {{used to treat}} the cognitive problems of AD: four are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (tacrine, rivastigmine, <b>galantamine</b> and donepezil) and the other (memantine) is an NMDA receptor antagonist. The benefit from their use is small. No medication has been clearly shown to delay or halt the progression of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Extracts of Narcissus have {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} potentially useful biological properties including antiviral, prophage induction, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimitotic, antiplatelet, hypotensive, emetic, acetylcholine esterase inhibitory, antifertility, antinociceptive, chronotropic, pheromone, plant growth inhibitor, and allelopathic. An ethanol extract of Narcissus bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of nociception, para-benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction, but not in another, the hot plate test. Most of these properties are due to alkaloids, but some are also due to mannosa-binding lectins. The most-studied alkaloids in this group are <b>galantamine</b> (galanthamine), lycorine, narciclasine, and pretazettine.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} Amarylidaceae genera, Narcissus {{contains}} unique isoquinoline alkaloids. The first alkaloid {{to be identified}} was lycorine, from N. pseudonarcissus in 1877. These are considered a protective adaptation, and are utilised in the classification of species. Nearly 100 alkaloids {{have been identified in}} the genus, about a third of all known Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, although not all species have been tested. Of the nine alkaloid ring types identified in the family, Narcissus species most commonly demonstrate the presence of alkaloids from within the Lycorine (lycorine, galanthine, pluviine) and Homolycorine (homolycorine, lycorenine) groups. Hemanthamine, Tazettine, Narciclasine, Montanine and <b>Galantamine</b> alkaloids are also represented. The alkaloid profile of any plant varies with time, location, and developmental stage. Narcissus also contain fructans and low molecular weight glucomannan in the leaves and plant stems.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{accounts}} suggest narcissi {{have been}} cultivated {{from the earliest}} times, but became increasingly popular in Europe after the 16th century and by the late 19th century were an important commercial crop centred primarily on the Netherlands. Today narcissi are popular as cut flowers and as ornamental plants in private and public gardens. The long history of breeding has resulted in thousands of different cultivars. For horticultural purposes, narcissi are classified into divisions, covering {{a wide range of}} shapes and colours. Like other members of their family, narcissi produce a number of different alkaloids, which provide some protection for the plant, but may be poisonous if accidentally ingested. This property has been exploited for medicinal use in traditional healing and has resulted in the production of <b>galantamine</b> for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Long celebrated in art and literature, narcissi are associated with a number of themes in different cultures, ranging from death to good fortune, and as symbols of spring. The daffodil is the national flower of Wales and the symbol of cancer charities in many countries. The appearance of the wild flowers in spring is associated with festivals in many places.|$|E
25|$|Usage of {{rivastigmine}} {{was associated}} with a higher frequency of reports of death as an adverse event in the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database compared to the other acetylcholinesterase inhibiting drugs donepezil and <b>galantamine.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} {{will depend}} on the cause of memory loss, but various drugs to treat Alzheimer’s disease have been suggested in recent years. There are four drugs currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of Alzheimer’s, and they all act on the cholinergic system: Donepezil, <b>Galantamine,</b> Rivastigmine, and Tacrine. Although these medications are not the cure for Alzheimer’s, symptoms may be reduced for up to eighteen months for mild or moderate dementia. These drugs do not forestall the ultimate decline to full Alzheimer's.|$|E
2500|$|Andreas Plaitakis and Roger Duvoisin in 1983 {{suggested}} that the mysterious magical herb moly that appears in Homer's Odyssey is actually snowdrop. An active substance in snowdrop is called <b>galantamine,</b> which, as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, could have acted {{as an antidote to}} Circe's poisons. Further supporting this notion are notes made during the fourth century BC by the Greek scholar Theophrastus who wrote in Historia plantarum that moly was [...] "used as an antidote against poisons" [...] although which specific poisons it was effective against remains unclear. <b>Galantamine</b> (or galanthamine) can be helpful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, though it is not a cure; the substance also occurs naturally in daffodils and other narcissi.|$|E

2500|$|Plants are a {{major source}} of complex and highly {{structurally}} diverse chemical compounds (phytochemicals), this structural diversity attributed in part to the natural selection of organisms producing [...] compounds to deter herbivory (feeding deterrents). Major classes of phytochemical include phenols, polyphenols, tannins, terpenes, and alkaloids. [...] Though the number of plants that have been extensively studied is relatively small, many pharmacologically active natural products have already been identified. [...] Clinically useful examples include the anticancer agents paclitaxel and omacetaxine mepesuccinate (from Taxus brevifolia and Cephalotaxus harringtonii, respectively), the antimalarial agent artemisinin (from Artemisia annua), and the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor <b>galantamine</b> (from Galanthus spp.), used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Other plant-derived drugs, used medicinally and/or recreationally include morphine, cocaine, quinine, tubocurarine, muscarine, and nicotine.|$|E
2500|$|Alkaloids are {{produced}} by a large variety of organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. They can be purified from crude extracts of these organisms by acid-base extraction. [...] Alkaloids have {{a wide range of}} pharmacological activities including antimalarial (e.g. quinine), antiasthma (e.g. ephedrine), anticancer (e.g. homoharringtonine), cholinomimetic (e.g. <b>galantamine),</b> vasodilatory (e.g. vincamine), antiarrhythmic (e.g. quinidine), analgesic (e.g. morphine), antibacterial (e.g. chelerythrine), and antihyperglycemic activities (e.g. piperine). [...] Many have found use in traditional or modern medicine, or as starting points for drug discovery. [...] Other alkaloids possess psychotropic (e.g. psilocin) and stimulant activities (e.g. cocaine, caffeine, nicotine, theobromine), and have been used in entheogenic rituals or as recreational drugs. Alkaloids can be toxic too (e.g. atropine, tubocurarine). [...] Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly evoke a bitter taste.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment of the {{movement}} and cognitive portions of the disease may worsen hallucinations and psychosis, while treatment of hallucinations and psychosis with antipsychotics may worsen parkinsonian or ADHD symptoms in DLB, such as tremor or rigidity and lack of concentration or impulse control. Physicians may find the use of cholinesterase inhibitors represents the treatment of choice for cognitive problems and donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), and <b>galantamine</b> (Reminyl) may be recommended {{as a means to}} help with these problems and to slow or prevent the decline of cognitive function. [...] DLB may be more responsive to donepezil than Alzheimer's disease. Memantine also may be useful. Levocarb may help with movement problems, but in some cases, as with dopamine agonists, may tend to aggravate psychosis in people with DLB. Clonazepam may help with rapid eye movement behavior disorder; table salt or antihypotensive medications may help with fainting and other problems associated with orthostatic hypotension. Botulinum toxin injections in the parotid glands may help with sialorrhea. Other medications, especially stimulants such as the ADHD drug methylphenidate (Ritalin) and modafinil, may improve daytime alertness, but as with the antiparkinsonian drug Levocarb, antihyperkinetics such as Ritalin increase the risk of psychosis. Experts advise extreme caution in the use of antipsychotic medication in people with DLB because of their sensitivity to these agents. When these medications must be used, atypical antipsychotics are preferred to typical antipsychotics; a very low dose should be tried initially and increased slowly, and patients should be carefully monitored for adverse reactions to the medications.|$|E

50|$|Since <b>galantamine</b> in metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, {{inhibiting}} {{either of}} these isoenzymes will increase the cholinergic effects of <b>galantamine.</b> Inhibiting these enzymes may lead to adverse effects. It was found that paroxetine, an inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the bioavailability of <b>galantamine</b> by 40%. The CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole and erythromycin increased the bioavailability of <b>galantamine</b> by 30% and 12%, respectively.|$|E
50|$|In humans, several {{metabolic}} pathways for <b>galantamine</b> exist. These pathways lead to {{the formation}} of a number of different metabolites. One of the metabolites that may result can be formed through the glucuronidation of <b>galantamine.</b> Additionally, <b>galantamine</b> may undergo oxidation or demethylation at its nitrogen atom, forming two other possible metabolites. <b>Galantamine</b> can undergo demethylation at its oxygen atom, forming an intermediate which can then undergo glucuronidation or sulfate conjugation. Lastly, <b>galantamine</b> may be oxidized and then reduced before finally undergoing demethylation or oxidation at its nitrogen atom, or demethylation and subsequent glucuronidation at its oxygen atom.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 75% of {{a dose of}} <b>galantamine</b> is metabolised in the liver. In vitro {{studies have}} shown that Hepatic CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are {{involved}} in <b>galantamine</b> metabolism.

5000|$|Research {{supported}} in part by the US Army has led to a US patent application for the use of <b>galantamine</b> and/or its derivatives for treatment of organophosphate poisoning. The indications for use of <b>galantamine</b> in the patent application include poisoning by nerve agents [...] "including but not limited to soman, sarin, and VX, tabun, and Novichok agents". <b>Galantamine</b> was studied in the research cited in the patent application for use along with the well-recognized nerve agent antidote atropine. According to the investigators, an unexpected synergistic interaction occurred between <b>galantamine</b> and atropine in an amount of 6 mg/kg or higher. Increasing the dose of <b>galantamine</b> from 5 to 8 mg/kg decreased the dose of atropine needed to protect experimental animals from the toxicity of soman in dosages 1.5.times the dose generally required to kill half the experimental animals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Galantamine</b> is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of mild to moderate vascular dementia and Alzheimer's.

50|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by the impairment of cholinergic function. One hypothesis is that this impairment contributes to the cognitive deficits caused by the disease. This hypothesis forms the basis for galantamine's use as a cholinergic enhancer in the treatment of Alzheimer's. <b>Galantamine</b> completely inhibits acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which hydrolyzes acetylcholine. As a result of acetylcholinesterase inhibition, <b>galantamine</b> increases the availability of acetylcholine for synaptic transmission. Additionally, <b>galantamine</b> binds to the allosteric sites of nicotinic receptors, which causes a conformational change. This allosteric modulation increases the nicotinic receptor's response to acetylcholine. The activation of presynaptic nicotinic receptors increases the release of acetylcholine, further increasing the availability of acetylcholine. Galantamine's competitive inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and allosteric nicotinic modulation serves as a dual mechanism of action.|$|E

50|$|<b>Galantamine</b> is {{produced}} from {{natural resources and}} a patented total synthesis process. Many other synthetic methods exist but have not been implemented on an industrial scale.|$|E
50|$|To {{reduce the}} {{prevalence}} of negative side effects associated with <b>galantamine,</b> such as nausea and vomiting, a dose-escalation scheme may be used. The use of a dose-escalation scheme has been well accepted in countries where <b>galantamine</b> is used. A dose-escalation scheme for Alzheimer's treatment involves a recommended starting dosage of 4mg <b>galantamine</b> tablets given twice a day (8 mg/day). After a minimum of 4 weeks, the dosage may then be increased to 8 mg given twice a day (16 mg/day). After a minimum of 4 weeks at 16 mg/day, the treatment may be increased to 12 mg given twice a day (24 mg/day). Dosage increases are based upon the assessment of clinical benefit as well as tolerability of the previous dosage. If treatment is interrupted {{for more than three}} days, the process is usually restarted, beginning at the starting dosage, and re-escalating to the current dose.|$|E
50|$|<b>Galantamine</b> {{may have}} some limited use in {{reducing}} the side-effects of anesthetics ketalar and diazepam. In one study, a control group of patients were given ketalar and diazepam and underwent anesthesia and surgery. The experimental group was given ketalar, diazepam, and nivalin (of which the active ingredient is <b>galantamine).</b> The degree of drowsiness and disorientation {{of the two groups}} was then assessed 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes after surgery.
