A suitable <b>immersion</b> <b>medium</b> should be non-toxic, must not penetrate the cell, and must be in osmotic equilibrium with it so that no change in volume (and hence in concentration) occurs. These requirements are best met by solutions of substances of higTf molecular weight. The effects observed when cells become freely permeable to such substances are described. An account of tests with various immersion media is given. The main substances tried have been peptone, proteose, protein hydrolysate, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, acacia gum, egg albumin, bovine gamma globulins, carboxyhaemoglobin, and bovine plasma albumin. Of these, bovine plasma albumin has proved to be most generally useful though acacia gum may be a good inexpensive substitute for some cells, particularly fungi.

40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} cement (CPC) that {{is based}} on α-tricalcium phosphate (α-TCP) is considered desirable for bone tissue engineering because of its relatively rapid degradation properties. However, such cement is relatively weak, restricting its use to areas of low mechanical stress. Wollastonite fibers (WF) have been used to improve the mechanical strength of biomaterials. However, the biological properties of WF remain poorly understood. Here, we tested the response of osteoblast-like cells to being cultured on CPC reinforced with 5 % of WF (CPC-WF). We found that both types of cement studied achieved an ion balance for calcium and phosphate after 3 days of <b>immersion</b> in culture <b>medium</b> and this allowed subsequent long-term cell culture.

40|$|Background: Individuals with {{impaired}} mobility can spend prolonged periods on support surfaces, increasing {{their risk of}} developing pressure ulcers. Manufacturers have developed mattresses to maximise contact area. The present study evaluated both the biomechanical and physiological responses to lying postures on a Fluid Immersion Simulation mattress. Methods: Seventeen healthy participants were recruited to evaluate the mattress during three prescribed settings of <b>immersion</b> (high, <b>medium</b> and low). Parameters reflecting biomechanical and physiological responses, and the microclimate were monitored during three postures (supine, lateral and high-sitting) over a 90 minute test session. Transcutaneous oxygen and carbon dioxide gas responses were categorised according to three criteria and data were compared between each condition. Findings: Results indicated that interface pressures remained consistent, with peak sacral values ranging from 21 to 27 mm Hg across all immersion settings and postures. The majority of participants (82 %) exhibited minimal changes in gas tensions at the sacrum during all test conditions. By contrast, three participants exhibited decreased oxygen with increased carbon dioxide tensions for all three immersion settings. Supine and high sitting sacral microclimate values ranged between 30. 1 – 30. 6 °C and 42. 3 – 44. 5 % for temperature and relative humidity respectively. During lateral tilt there was a reduction of 1. 7 – 2. 5 °C and 3. 3 – 5. 3 % in these values. The majority of participants reported high comfort scores, although a few experienced bottoming out during the high-sitting posture at the high immersion setting.
