40|$|Abstract Background The transcription/export {{complex is}} {{evolutionarily}} conserved from yeast to man and {{is required for}} coupled transcription elongation and nuclear export of mRNAs. FMIP(Fms <b>interacting</b> <b>protein)</b> {{is a member of}} the THO (suppressors of the transcriptional defects of hpr 1 delta by overexpression) complex which is a subcomplex of the transcription/export complex. THO complex (THOC) components are not essential for bulk poly (A) + RNA export in higher eukaryotes, but for the nuclear export of subset of mRNAs, however, their exact role is still unclear. Results To study the role of THOC 5 /Fms <b>interacting</b> <b>protein</b> in vivo, we generated THOC 5 /Fms <b>interacting</b> <b>protein</b> knockout mice. Since these mice are embryonic lethal, we then generated interferon inducible conditional THOC 5 /Fms <b>interacting</b> <b>protein</b> knockout mice. After three poly injections all of the mice died within 14 days. No pathological alterations, however, were observed in liver, kidney or heart. Thus we considered the hematopoietic system and found that seven days after poly injection, the number of blood cells in peripheral blood decreased drastically. Investigation of bone marrow cells showed that these became apoptotic within seven days after poly injection. Committed myeloid progenitor cells and cells with long term reconstituting potential were lost from bone marrow within four days after poly injection. Furthermore, infusion of normal bone marrow cells rescued mice from death induced by loss of THOC 5 /Fms <b>interacting</b> <b>protein.</b> Conclusion THOC 5 /Fms <b>interacting</b> <b>protein</b> is an essential element in the maintenance of hematopoiesis. Furthermore, mechanistically depletion of THOC 5 /Fms <b>interacting</b> <b>protein</b> causes the down-regulation of its direct interacting partner, THOC 1 which may contribute to altered THO complex function and cell death. </p...|$|R
25|$|The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) is {{a genetic}} {{screening}} technique {{that can be}} used to detect physical (binding) protein–protein or protein–DNA interactions. It tests a 'bait' protein of known function that is fused to the binding domain of the transcription factor GAL4 against potential <b>interacting</b> <b>proteins</b> or a cDNA library that express the GAL4 activation domain (the 'prey').|$|E
25|$|PreBIND an {{associated}} system for data mining to locate biomolecular interaction {{information in the}} scientific literature. The name or accession number of a protein can be entered and PreBIND will scan the literature and return a list of potentially <b>interacting</b> <b>proteins.</b> BIND BLAST is also available to find interactions with proteins {{that are similar to}} the one specified in the query.|$|E
25|$|Each {{of these}} points alone can {{give rise to}} false results. Due to the {{combined}} effects of all error sources yeast two-hybrid have to be interpreted with caution. The probability of generating false positives means that all interactions should be confirmed by a high confidence assay, for example co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins, which is difficult for large scale protein–protein interaction data. Alternatively, Y2H data can be verified using multiple Y2H variants or bioinformatics techniques. The latter test whether <b>interacting</b> <b>proteins</b> are expressed at the same time, share some common features (such as gene ontology annotations or certain network topologies), have homologous interactions in other species.|$|E

25|$|After the {{demonstration}} of successful fluorescent protein fragment reconstitution in mammalian cells, Hu et al. described the use of fragmented yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) {{in the investigation of}} bZIP and Rel family transcription factor interactions. This was the first report bZIP protein interaction regulation by regions outside of the bZIP domain, regulation of subnuclear localization of the bZIP domains Fos and Jun by their different interacting partners, and modulation of transcriptional activation of bZIP and Rel proteins through mutual interactions. In addition, this study was the first report of an in vivo technique, now known as the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay, to provide insight into the structural basis of protein complex formation through detection of fluorescence caused by the assembly of fluorescent reporter protein fragments tethered to <b>interacting</b> <b>proteins.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, complex {{modelling}} {{revolved around}} manually identifying {{features on the}} surfaces of the interactors, and interpreting the consequences for binding, function and activity; any computer programmes were typically used {{at the end of}} the modelling process, to discriminate between the relatively few configurations which remained after all the heuristic constraints had been imposed. The first use of computers was in a study on hemoglobin interaction in sickle-cell fibres. This was followed in 1978 by work on the trypsin-BPTI complex. Computers discriminated between good and bad models using a scoring function which rewarded large interface area, and pairs of molecules in contact but not occupying the same space. The computer used a simplified representation of the <b>interacting</b> <b>proteins,</b> with one interaction centre for each residue. Favorable electrostatic interactions, including hydrogen bonds, were identified by hand.|$|E
25|$|In any study, some of {{the protein}} domains, those under investigation, will be varied {{according}} to {{the goals of the}} study whereas other domains, those that are not themselves being investigated, will be kept constant. For example, in a two-hybrid study to select DNA-binding domains, the DNA-binding domain, BD, will be varied while the two <b>interacting</b> <b>proteins,</b> the bait and prey, must be kept constant to maintain a strong binding between the BD and AD. There are a number of domains from which to choose the BD, bait and prey and AD, if these are to remain constant. In protein–protein interaction investigations, the BD may be chosen from any of many strong DNA-binding domains such as Zif268. A frequent choice of bait and prey domains are residues 263–352 of yeast Gal11P with a N342V mutation and residues 58–97 of yeast Gal4, respectively. These domains can be used in both yeast- and bacterial-based selection techniques and are known to bind together strongly.|$|E

25|$|Although theoretically, any living cell {{might be}} used as the {{background}} to a two-hybrid analysis, there are practical considerations that dictate which is chosen. The chosen cell line should be relatively cheap and easy to culture and sufficiently robust to withstand application of the investigative methods and reagents. The latter is especially important for doing high-throughput studies. Therefore the yeast S. cerevisiae has been the main host organism for two-hybrid studies. However it is not always the ideal system to study <b>interacting</b> <b>proteins</b> from other organisms. Yeast cells often {{do not have the same}} post translational modifications, have a different codon use or lack certain proteins that are important for the correct expression of the proteins. To cope with these problems several novel two-hybrid systems have been developed. Depending on the system used agar plates or specific growth medium is used to grow the cells and allow selection for interaction. The most common used method is the agar plating one where cells are plated on selective medium to see of interaction takes place. Cells that have no interaction proteins should not survive on this selective medium.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe overall {{prognosis}} for operable gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma remains poor and therefore neoadjuvant chemotherapy {{has become the}} standard of care, in addition to radical surgery. Certain anticancer agents (e. g. anthracyclines and cisplatin) generate damaging reactive oxygen species as by-products of their mechanism of action. Drug effectiveness can therefore depend upon the presence of cellular redox buffering systems that are often deregulated in cancer. The expression of the redox <b>protein,</b> thioredoxin <b>interacting</b> <b>protein,</b> was assessed in gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinomas. Thioredoxin <b>interacting</b> <b>protein</b> expression was assessed using conventional immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray of 140 adenocarcinoma patients treated by primary surgery alone and 88 operable cases treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In the primary surgery cases, high thioredoxin <b>interacting</b> <b>protein</b> expression associated {{with a lack of}} lymph node involvement (p= 0. 005), no perineural invasion (p= 0. 030) and well/moderate tumour differentiation (p= 0. 033). In the neoadjuvant tumours, high thioredoxin <b>interacting</b> <b>protein</b> expression was an independent marker for improved disease specific survival (p= 0. 002) especially in cases with anthracycline-based regimes (p= 0. 008). This study highlights the potential of thioredoxin <b>interacting</b> <b>protein</b> as a biomarker for response in neoadjuvant treated gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma and may represent a useful therapeutic target due to its association with tumour progression...|$|R

2500|$|Further {{experimentation}} with GFP-tagged proteins and mutant proteins {{indicates that the}} medial cortical nodes are formed by the ordered, Cdr2-dependent assembly of multiple <b>interacting</b> <b>proteins</b> during interphase. [...] Cdr2 {{is at the top}} of this hierarchy and works upstream of Cdr1 and Blt1. [...] Mitosis is promoted by the negative regulation of Wee1 by Cdr2. [...] It has also been shown that Cdr2 recruits Wee1 to the medial cortical node. [...] The mechanism of this recruitment has yet to be discovered. [...] A Cdr2 kinase mutant, which is able to localize properly despite a loss of function in phosphorylation, disrupts the recruitment of Wee1 to the medial cortex and delays entry into mitosis. [...] Thus, Wee1 localizes with its inhibitory network, which demonstrates that mitosis is controlled through Cdr2-dependent negative regulation of Wee1 at the medial cortical nodes.|$|E
2500|$|BiFC {{has been}} {{expanded}} to include the study of RNA-binding protein interactions in a method Rackham and Brown described as trimolecular fluorescence complementation (TriFC). In this method, a fragment of the Venus fluorescent protein is fused to the mRNA of interest, and the complementary Venus portion fused to the RNA-binding protein of interest. Similar to BiFC, if the mRNA and protein interact, the Venus protein will be reconstituted and fluoresce. [...] Also known as the RNA bridge method, as the fluorophore and other <b>interacting</b> <b>proteins</b> form {{a bridge between the}} protein and the RNA of interest, this allows a simple detection and localisation of RNA-protein interactions within a living cell and provides a simple method to detect direct or indirect RNA-protein association (i.e. within a complex) that can be verified through in vitro analysis of purified compounds or RNAi knockdown of the bridging molecule(s).|$|E
2500|$|When {{designing}} plasmid vectors {{to express}} the proteins of interest, the construct {{must be able to}} express proteins that are able to form fusion proteins with fluorescent protein fragments without disrupting the protein's function. In addition, the expected protein complex must be able to accept stabilisation of the fluorescent protein fragment interaction without affecting the protein complex function or the cell being studied. Many fluorescent protein fragments that combine in several ways can be used in BiFC. Generally, YFP is recommended to serve as the reporter protein, cleaved at residue 155 (N-terminal consisting of residues 1–154 and C-terminal consisting of residues 155–238) or residue 173 in particular, as these sets of fragments are highly efficient in their complementation when fused to many <b>interacting</b> <b>proteins</b> and they produce low levels fluorescence when fused to non-interacting proteins. It is suggested that each target protein is fused to both the N- and C-terminal fragments of the fluorescent reporter protein in turn, and that the fragments are fused at each of the N- and C-terminal ends of the target proteins.

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{proteins}} listed that interact with CCDC130, including EEF1A1, NINL, TRAF2, ZBTB16, ZNF165, and ZNF24. EEF1A1 is a eukaryotic elongation factor that {{is involved in}} the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site of ribosomes during translation. [...] NINL is a ninein-like protein that is involved in microtubule organization and has calcium ion binding activity. TRAF2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor 2, is part of some E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes and is involved in ubiquitinating proteins so they can get degraded by the proteasome. ZBTB16, zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 16, is also part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and is most likely involved in substrate recognition. There is also an alternate form of CCDC130 where only 803 bases are transcribed instead of 1433 bases, but there is no additional information provided. [...] ZNF165 and ZNF24 are both zinc finger proteins, which bind DNA and other proteins to regulate transcription. Below is a table of the <b>interacting</b> <b>proteins</b> for CCDC130 assembled by GeneCards. The interactions of CCDC130 with NINL, ZNF24, TRAF2, JUP, GATA5 have been verified by a two-hybrid screen according to STRING, so these interactions do occur. JUP is a plaque protein. GATA5 is a transcription factor that helps activate the promoter for lactase-phlorizin hydrolase. Interactions with CDA, DERA, CDC40, NAA25, DGCR14, NAA20, and PRPF19 have not been verified experimentally, but interactions between gene homologs have been documented in other species according to STRING so these interactions could potentially occur. ZBTB16, EEF1A1, and ZNF165 all have been verified by at least one two-hybrid screen according to MINT. NAT9 was described as a known interactant on I2D. In a study done at the University of the District of Columbia to characterize CCDC130, they have found that it is induced through insulin signaling, is targeted by three different kinases (GSK3, CK1, and CK2), and is a mitochondrial protein.5 The study also shows that CCDC130 can potentially be used as a biomarker for certain types of cancer due to its differential expression in cancer cells. The study specifically mentions that CCDC130 is downregulated in some types of colon cancer, which allowed more cancer cells to be untargeted by the apoptosis pathway.|$|E
