5|$|My loving people, we {{have been}} persuaded by some that are careful of our safety, to take heed how we commit ourself to armed multitudes for fear of treachery; but I assure you, I do not desire to live to {{distrust}} my faithful and loving people... I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman, but I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> and stomach of a king, and of a King of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any Prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm.|$|E
25|$|But {{after seven}} months I {{dropped out of}} Dune, by then Rudy Wurlitzer {{had come up with}} a first-draft script which I felt was a decent {{distillation}} of Frank Herbert's. But I also realised Dune was {{going to take a lot}} more work—at least two and a half years' worth. And I didn't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> to attack that because my older brother Frank unexpectedly died of cancer while I was prepping the De Laurentiis picture. Frankly, that freaked me out. So I went to Dino and told him the Dune script was his.|$|E
25|$|Polybius also blamed Demetrius' {{influence}} for Philip's tyrannical behavior. One incident involved Philip's apparent role in {{a massacre}} {{carried out by the}} people against their leaders that occurred at Messene in 215 BC. Arriving on the scene the day after the massacre and wanting to seize the acropolis, Philip asked his advisors whether the entrails of a sacrifice which had been made indicated that he should quit the citadel or hold it. Demetrius responded by saying: if you <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> of an augur, quit it as quick as you can, but as a gallant and wise king, keep it, lest if you quit it now you may never have so good an opportunity again, for it is by thus holding the two horns that you can alone keep the ox under your control.|$|E
50|$|<b>Having</b> <b>the</b> <b>Heart</b> for War is the self-produced debut {{recording}} Christian metalcore band Mychildren Mybride. It {{was released}} independently in 2005. Though it got no critical review in <b>the</b> mainstream, <b>Having</b> <b>the</b> <b>Heart</b> for War was the staple album that Mychildren Mybride used on their extensive tours that {{led them to}} their relationship with Christian record label Solid State Records.|$|R

Tom said, [...] "I don't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> to tell them what's {{going to happen to}} Kurt Cobain in 1994", a reference to the suicide of the band's lead singer. Before Tom eats a hot pepper at the dinner party, he sings, [...] "This is how you eat it" [...] to the tune of the 1995 Montell Jordan song [...] "This Is How We Do It". Leslie said she was saving an old newspaper because it had the [...] "first rumblings of Iran-Contra", a reference to the scandal in which U.S. figures facilitated the sale of arms to Iran. Tom visits Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia, to learn more about India when quizzed by Justin.|$|E

2500|$|One {{critic who}} found Nabucco revolting was Otto Nicolai, the {{composer}} {{to whom the}} libretto was first offered. A Prussian, Nicolai felt at odds with emotional Italian opera while he lived near Milan. After refusing to accept the libretto proposal from Merelli, Nicolai began work on another offer called Il Proscritto. Its disastrous premiere in March 1841 forced Nicolai to cancel his contract with Merelli and return to Vienna. From there he learned {{of the success of}} Nabucco and was enraged. [...] "Verdi's operas are really horrible," [...] he wrote. [...] "He scores like a fool [...] technically he is not even professional [...] and he must <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> of a donkey and in my view he is a pitiful, despicable composer... Nabucco is nothing but [...] "rage, invective, bloodshed and murder."" ...|$|E
2500|$|Jo first {{appears in}} the 1971 serial Terror of the Autons, having been {{assigned}} to the Doctor (Jon Pertwee) {{as a replacement for}} Liz Shaw (Caroline John). Apparently, she gained the assignment to UNIT because her uncle, a high ranking civil servant, had [...] "pulled some strings". Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney) assigns her to the Doctor, who is initially dismayed when he finds out that she is not a scientist, but accepts her because he does not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> to tell her otherwise. An enthusiastic, bubbly and sometimes scatter-brained blonde, Jo soon endears herself to the other members of UNIT, especially Captain Mike Yates (Richard Franklin) and Sergeant Benton (John Levene). The Third Doctor is also particularly attached to her, and she is devoted to him, refusing to leave his side even where mortal danger is involved.|$|E
2500|$|Vamp Willow {{appears in}} the third season episodes [...] "The Wish" [...] and [...] "Doppelgangland". She is [...] and aggressive, the {{opposite}} of Willow's usual nature; her bad behavior so exaggerated {{that it does not}} instill fear into the viewer like other female vampires in the series, but indicates more about Willow's personality. Shocked upon seeing her alter ego in [...] "Doppelgangland", Willow states [...] "That's me as a vampire? I'm so evil and [...] And I think I'm kinda gay!" [...] Angel is stopped by Buffy in telling the Scoobies that the vampire self carries many of the same attributes as the human self, at which Willow says that is nothing like her. Many Buffy fans saw this as a funny Easter egg when Willow revealed herself to actually be a lesbian in later seasons. As surprised as Willow is with Vamp Willow, she feels bound to her, and does not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> to allow Buffy to kill her. Both Willows make the observation that [...] "this world's no fun", before they send Vamp Willow back into the alternate dimension from which she came, whereupon she is staked and dies immediately.|$|E
