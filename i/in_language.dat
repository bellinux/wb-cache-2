5|$|Howard and {{her husband}} were part of a circle of artists, writers and {{designers}} who were interested in visual images, <b>in</b> <b>language</b> and in the book arts. One close associate was the graphic designer Allan Fleming, whose Martlet Press published Twenty-Eight Drawings by Barbara Howard in 1970, a period when she was drawing the figure. The Canadian wood engraver Rosemary Kilbourn, a close friend since art college, taught Howard to carve images that could be printed in conjunction with text.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to PET and fMRI, which show which {{areas of the}} brain are activated by certain tasks, researchers also use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which shows the neural pathways that connect different brain areas, thus providing insight into how different areas interact.

5|$|In {{the era of}} the {{influential}} linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, it was assumed that the mapping between form and meaning <b>in</b> <b>language</b> must be completely arbitrary. Although onomatopoeia is a clear exception, since words like 'choo-choo' bear clear resemblance to the sounds that they mimic, the Saussurean approach was to treat these as marginal exceptions. ASL, with its significant inventory of iconic signs, directly challenges this theory.|$|E

5|$|Standard {{diagnostic}} criteria require impairment in social interaction and repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, activities and interests, without significant delay <b>in</b> <b>language</b> or cognitive development. Unlike the international standard, the DSM-IV-TR criteria also required significant impairment in day-to-day functioning; DSM-5 eliminated AS {{as a separate}} diagnosis in 2013, and folded it into the umbrella of autism spectrum disorders. Other sets of {{diagnostic criteria}} have been proposed by Szatmari et al. and by Gillberg and Gillberg.|$|E
5|$|As a {{pervasive}} developmental disorder, Asperger syndrome is distinguished by {{a pattern of}} symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay <b>in</b> <b>language.</b> Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E

5|$|Christianity {{was a major}} unifying factor between Eastern and Western Europe {{before the}} Arab conquests, but the conquest of North Africa sundered {{maritime}} connections between those areas. Increasingly the Byzantine Church differed <b>in</b> <b>language,</b> practices, and liturgy from the Western Church. The Eastern Church used Greek instead of the Western Latin. Theological and political differences emerged, and by the early and middle 8th century issues such as iconoclasm, clerical marriage, and state control of the Church had widened {{to the extent that}} the cultural and religious differences were greater than the similarities. The formal break, known as the East–West Schism, came in 1054, when the papacy and the patriarchy of Constantinople clashed over papal supremacy and excommunicated each other, which led to the division of Christianity into two Churches—the Western branch became the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern branch the Eastern Orthodox Church.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh's {{territory}} lay {{in what is}} now Scotland {{south of}} the River Forth, a multi-ethnic region during the late 12th century. North of the Forth was the Gaelic kingdom of Scotland (Alba), which under its partially Normanised kings exercised direct or indirect control over most of the region to the south as far as the borders of Northumberland and Cumberland. Lothian and the Merse were the heartlands of {{the northern part of the}} old English Earldom of Northumbria, and in the late 12th century the people of these regions, as well as the people of Lauderdale, Eskdale, Liddesdale, and most of Teviotdale and Annandale, were English <b>in</b> <b>language</b> and regarded themselves as English by ethnicity, despite having been under the control of the king of the Scots for at least a century.|$|E

5|$|Miller's Language and Communication {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{significant}} texts in the study of language behavior. The book was a scientific study of language, emphasizing quantitative data, and was based on the mathematical model of Claude Shannon's information theory. It used a probabilistic model imposed on a learning-by-association scheme borrowed from behaviorism, with Miller not yet attached to a pure cognitive perspective. The first part of the book reviewed information theory, the physiology and acoustics of phonetics, speech recognition and comprehension, and statistical techniques to analyze language. The focus was more on speech generation than recognition. The second part had the psychology: idiosyncratic differences across people <b>in</b> <b>language</b> use; developmental linguistics; the structure of word associations in people; use of symbolism in language; and social aspects of language use.|$|E
5|$|Speaking is {{the default}} {{modality}} for language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other {{components of the}} vocal apparatus, the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language. The study of the genetic bases for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been implicated <b>in</b> <b>language</b> production is FOXP2, which may cause a kind of congenital language disorder if affected by mutations.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Roman Empire was <b>in</b> <b>language</b> {{and civilization}} a Greek society.

At the beginning of the Byzantine millennium, the koine (Greek: κοινή) remained the basis for spoken Greek and Christian writings, while Attic Greek was the language of the philosophers and orators.|$|E
