5|$|Chad {{has more}} than 200 {{distinct}} ethnic groups, which create diverse social structures. The colonial administration and independent governments <b>have</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> impose a national society, but for most Chadians the local or regional society remains the most important influence outside the immediate family. Nevertheless, Chad's peoples may be classified according to the geographical region in which they live.|$|E
5|$|Competitors such as McDonald's and Wendy's <b>have</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> create burgers {{similar to}} the Whopper, often nicknamed a Whopper Stopper during the {{development}} phase. Wendy's created the Big Classic with similar toppings but served on a bulkie roll, while McDonald's has created at least six different versions, including the McDLT, the Arch Deluxe, and the Big N' Tasty.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} Campanian of North America, Daspletosaurus was a {{contemporary}} of the albertosaurine tyrannosaurid Gorgosaurus. This {{is one of}} the few examples of two tyrannosaur genera coexisting. In modern predator guilds, similar-sized predators are separated into different ecological niches by anatomical, behavioral or geographical differences that limit competition. Several studies <b>have</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> explain niche differentiation in Daspletosaurus and Gorgosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1970s {{there have}} been various {{initiatives}} to attempt to regenerate Coatbridge.

5|$|As an {{arboreal}} lizard, V. salvadorii {{can hang}} onto branches with its rear legs and occasionally use its tail as a prehensile grip. The primary {{use of the}} tail, however, is to counterbalance its weight when leaping from one branch to another. The tail may {{also be used for}} defense, as captive specimens <b>have</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> whip their keepers with their tails. This species is occasionally seen in the pet trade, but has earned a reputation of being aggressive and unpredictable. Although they are known to rest and bask in trees, they sleep on the ground or submerged in water.|$|E

5|$|Hadid had {{previously}} been commissioned to a temporary pavilion for the London's Serpentine Gallery in 2000. The pavilion was such a success that the gallery has added annual temporary pavilions every year since.

She also created a mobile temporary work for Chanel that was displayed in Hong Kong, Tokyo and New York in 2008.

Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer‚Äîwho was to the end the war as the most successful night fighter ace on 121 aerial victories‚Äîwas said to <b>have</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> gain support for a like-minded offensive. Schnaufer pursued RAF bombers regularly to the English coast, or least {{the other side of}} the frontline. He experienced a lack of British interference beyond German-held territory.

5|$|Little {{is known}} for the {{following}} eight years, but by 1085 Vsevolod and Yaropolk are reported to have become entrenched against each other.

The first, fundamental galactic parameters, was aimed at answering key questions about the size, shape and the rotation rate of the Milky Way. The team hoped to more accurately determine {{the distance from the}} Sun to the galactic center. The second topic, the Oort Limit, would <b>have</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> determine the mass of the galactic disk.|$|E

The German authorities have also argued the bust is too fragile to transport and that the legal arguments for the repatriation were insubstantial. According to The Times, Germany may be concerned that lending the bust to Egypt would mean its permanent departure from Germany.|$|E
5|$|Several historians <b>have</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> {{establish}} {{the dates of}} Kanhopatra's life and death. One estimate places her life circa 1428 CE by relating her to a Bahamani king of Bidar who {{is often associated with}} the Kanhopatra story‚Äîalthough in most accounts, that king is never explicitly named. Pawar estimates that she died in 1480. Others suggest dates of 1448, 1468 or 1470, or simply say that she lived in the 15th century‚Äîor in rare instances, the 13th or 16th century. According to Zelliot, she was a contemporary of saint-poets Chokhamela (14th century) and Namadeva (c.1270-c.1350).|$|E
