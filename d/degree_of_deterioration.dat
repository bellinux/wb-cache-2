Using stochastic regenerative properties of the system, a stochastic model is developed in order to analyze the deterioration process and a novel approach is presented that simultaneously determines the time between two successive inspection periods and the appropriate maintenance action for each of the components based on the observed <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>deterioration.</b> This approach considers different criteria like reliability and long-run expected cost of the system.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{gradually}} deteriorating equipment whose actual <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>deterioration</b> can be revealed by inspections only. An inspection can be succeeded by a revision depending on the system's <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>deterioration.</b> In the absence of inspections and revisions, the working condition of the system evolves according to a Markov chain whose changes of state are not observable {{with the possible exception}} of a breakdown. Examples of this model include production machines subject to stochastic breakdowns, and maintenance of communication systems. The cost structure of the model consists of inspection, revision and operating costs. It is intuitively reasonable that in many applications a simple control-limit rule will be optimal. Such a rule prescribes a revision only when inspection reveals that the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>deterioration</b> has exceeded some critical level. A special-purpose Markov decision algorithm operating on the class of control-limit rules is developed for the computation of an average cost optimal schedule of inspections and revisions. © 1985...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Impaired {{baseline}} kidney {{function is}} a well-defined {{risk factor for}} progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We evaluated measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the serum markers creatinine, cystatin C, and beta-trace protein (BTP) for diagnostic accuracy in defining the stage of kidney impairment and as risk predictors of CKD progression. METHODS: We measured serum marker concentrations in 227 patients with primary nondiabetic CKD and various <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> renal impairment and followed 177 patients prospectively for up to 7 years to assess progression of CKD. RESULTS: At baseline, creatinine, cystatin C, and BTP were strongly correlated with GFR as measured by iohexol clearance. Concentrations of all 3 markers increased progressively with decreasing GFR, and their diagnostic performance for the detection <b>of</b> even minor <b>deteriorations</b> <b>of</b> renal function (GFR < 90 mL x min(- 1) x (1. 73 m(2)) (- 1)) was similar. Sixty-five patients experienced progression of CKD, defined as doubling of baseline creatinine and/or terminal renal failure during prospective follow-up. These patients were older and had a lower GFR and higher serum creatinine, cystatin C, and BTP values at baseline (all P < 0. 001) compared with the patients who did not reach a predefined renal endpoint. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that all 3 clearance markers were equally strong predictors of CKD progression, even after adjustment for age, sex, GFR, and proteinuria. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic performance of serum creatinine, cystatin C, or BTP for detecting even minor <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> renal function is good, and these markers provide reliable risk prediction for progression of kidney disease in patients with CKD...|$|R

40|$|The major {{problems}} affecting the service life of bridges {{are related to}} {{various factors such as}} fatigue-sensitive details, increased service loads, corrosion deterioration, and the lack of proper maintenance. Among them, corrosion deterioration and fatigue damages of structures particularly to steel girder bridges are the most common ones. Bridges of different structural forms, at different locations or under different climates, may suffer from various <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>deterioration.</b> Steel girders at different positions of a bridge may also suffer from different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> damage. How to effectively maintain the bridge asset at a minimal cost and how to predict the time for future works are crucial, particularly when government funding sources become stretched. A comprehensive bridge management framework assisting stakeholders to appropriately and reasonably prioritize their future maintenance-related works in their bridge stocks, such that stakeholders can better allocate the limited resources, is utmost concerned. This paper proposes an integrated life-cycle management (LCM) strategy on steel girders in bridges in which corrosion deterioration and fatigue damage prediction models are mapped with girders performance conditions. A practical example to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed LCM strategy is also illustrated. Copyright © 2012 Kevin K. L. So et al...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Laumontite is a harmful mineral for concrete. However, {{the details}} and {{mechanism}} of deterioration of concrete due to laumontite are unknown. We carried out two kinds of exposure tests on mortar containing laumontite-bearing aggregate. As the result, we found that deterioration included popout, cracking and exfoliation. These deteriorations appeared only in mortar that was affected by rainfall. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>deterioration</b> was correlated with the content of laumontite in aggregate and grain size of laumontite. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>deterioration</b> increased for large content and large size. Observation by a petrographic microscope and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and chemical analysis on the deteriorated mortars were done to clarify the mechanism of the deterioration. As a result, we found radial cracks around laumontite grains. The pattern of these cracks suggests that they were formed by the expansion of laumontite. Chemical analysis of cement paste around laumontite in the deteriorated mortars showed {{that there were no}} expansive hydration minerals. The results of an expansion test on laumontite showed that pressure was produced when laumontite became wet. These results indicate that the mechanism of deterioration was the expansion pressure of laumontite...|$|E
