40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the effect of elimination of daily routine chest radiographs on chest radiographic practice in cardiothoracic surgery patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit and <b>the</b> post-intensive <b>care</b> unit ward. METHODS: We used a prospective, comparative study design with an intervention in a 28 -bed intensive care unit/post-intensive care unit ward (including a 4 -bed medium-care unit) in a university hospital. Cardiothoracic surgery patients were admitted to <b>the</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit during a period of 6 months (3 months before intervention and 3 months after intervention). Daily routine chest radiographs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit were eliminated; all chest radiographs required a clinical indication. Routine chest radiographs were not performed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> post-intensive <b>care</b> unit ward, {{both before and after the}} intervention. RESULTS: Before intervention, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit 353 daily routine chest radiographs and 261 on-demand chest radiographs were obtained in 175 patients; after intervention, 275 on-demand chest radiographs were obtained in 163 patients. Before intervention, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> post-intensive <b>care</b> unit ward 413 on-demand chest radiographs were obtained in 167 patients; after intervention, 445 on-demand chest radiographs were obtained in 161 patients. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit <b>the</b> number of chest radiographs per patient day decreased from 1. 8 +/- 0. 6 to 1. 1 +/- 0. 6. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> post-intensive <b>care</b> unit ward <b>the</b> number of chest radiographs per patient per day was 0. 4 +/- 0. 2, both before and after the intervention. Slightly more unexpected abnormalities were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> on-demand chest radiographs after the intervention. No negative influence on chest radiography timing, length of stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit and hospital, and readmission rate was seen. CONCLUSIONS: Elimination of daily routine chest radiographs led to a decrease of the total number of chest radiographs obtained per patient per day <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit and did not change chest radiography practice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> post-intensive <b>care</b> unit war...|$|R
