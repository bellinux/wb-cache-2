500|$|On July 20, Thome hit {{his first}} home {{run with the}} Orioles, his 610th of all time moving him past Sosa for seventh place all-time, against the Indians at Progressive Field. On August 6, Thome {{was placed on the}} 15-day {{disabled}} list with a herniated disk; he remained on the DL until September 21. In his first game back, he drove in the game-winning RBI in extra innings against the Boston Red Sox. After beating the Indians in a game where he hit his 611th career home run, Thome said, [...] "There's a lot [...] memories. I've had great memories on that side and then coming in here as an opponent against them. Any time you come home, they say, it's very special. It's even more special to get the W's. That's, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> thing. The bottom line is I played here a long time." [...] Orioles teammates remarked at Thome's commitment to talking about the game while in the dugout. Thome remarked, [...] "I talk the game. When I sit in the dugout during games, I talk baseball to these guys. They'll ask, 'Hey, what's this pitcher like?' or 'What about the game?' 'What about all those Indians teams you were on?' I did it to Eddie Murray {{when he was in his}} 40s." [...] The Orioles made the playoffs, but lost in five games to the Yankees during the AL Division Series. Thome hit [...]133 in the playoffs with no home runs or RBIs.|$|E
2500|$|Brodsky’s third book, The Inside Story, {{began as}} an off-hand comment from a friend. Brodsky asked if her friend would like Brodsky to mail some letters for her, and the friend responded, [...] "they'll be very happy." [...] This led Brodsky to imagine happy letters, excited to go where they are going. Rebecca Rule writes in her review {{that it is a}} story [...] "about what happens on those {{occasions}} (rare these days, it seems) when one writes and mails a personal letter, told {{from the point of view}} of an envelope." [...] This gave Brodsky an opportunity to broach the idea of change and how children can best understand and cope with it. Brodsky explains: [...] "Even though the story is an adventure about recycling and the mail system, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> theme is about change. Change is difficult for all of us. Kids often deal with change -- in school, in their families, in their neighborhoods." [...] For its discussion of recycling, the book received a national citation from the Green Book Festival in San Francisco.|$|E

60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> {{mistake of}} Mr. Wells's {{philosophy}} is a somewhat deeper one, {{one that he}} expresses in a very entertaining manner in {{the introductory part of}} the new Utopia. His philosophy in some sense amounts to a denial of the possibility of philosophy itself. At least, he maintains that there are no secure and reliable ideas upon which we can rest with a final mental satisfaction. It will be both clearer, however, and more amusing to quote Mr. Wells himself.|$|E
60|$|Before {{starting}} to America I had completed Orley Farm, a novel {{which appeared in}} shilling numbers,--after {{the manner in which}} Pickwick, Nicholas Nickleby, and many others had been published. Most of those among my friends who talk to me now about my novels, and are competent to form an opinion on the subject, say that this is the best I have written. In this opinion I do not coincide. I think that the highest merit which a novel can have consists in perfect delineation of character, rather than in plot, or humour, or pathos, and I shall before long mention a subsequent work in which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> character of the story is so well developed as to justify me in asserting its claim above the others. The plot of Orley Farm is probably the best I have ever made; but it has the fault of declaring itself, and thus coming to an end too early in the book. When Lady Mason tells her ancient lover that she did forge the will, the plot of Orley Farm has unravelled itself;--and this she does {{in the middle of the}} tale. Independently, however, of this the novel is good. Sir Peregrine Orme, his grandson, Madeline Stavely, Mr. Furnival, Mr. Chaffanbrass, and the commercial gentlemen, are all good. The hunting is good. The lawyer's talk is good. Mr. Moulder carves his turkey admirably, and Mr. Kantwise sells his tables and chairs with spirit. I do not know that there is a dull page in the book. I am fond of Orley Farm;--and am especially fond of its illustrations by Millais, which are the best I have seen in any novel in any language.|$|E

2500|$|Starting {{the tournament}} as {{defending}} champions, Lithuania proved their favoritism by beating Turkey, Croatia and Bulgaria with solid differences {{and an average}} of 88 points. However, the knockout rounds had the team eliminated with an underwhelming performance, scoring only 47 points in a quarterfinal with France. National team coach Antanas Sireika said: [...] "We played the worst game in <b>the</b> championship and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>main</b> reason {{of this is that}} the players failed to deal with the psychological tension.

40|$|The {{paper by}} Lustrino and Carminati (this volume) {{presents}} an exhaustive {{review of the}} different hypothesis for the nature of mantle sources of Cenozoic to Quaternary Na-alkaline mafic volcanics from the Circum-Mediterranean and Europe regions, and the causes of mantle melting within the geodynamic setting of eruptions. This magmatism is often proposed, based on geochemistry and tomography, {{to be related to}} mantle plumes coming from the core-mantle boundary. Nevertheless the authors show that, considering not only major-element and isotope geochemistry and tomographic models, but also the geodynamic evolution of both regions, the mantle sources are likely to be much shallower and mostly in a heterogeneous metasomatized lithospheric mantle. Mantle melting is checked by plate tectonic processes. In these regions where lithospheric extension was and is always the prevailing mechanism during eruptions, mantle melting occurs by decompression during rifting-related uplift and is enhanced by the low melting points of crust-contaminated lithologies.
