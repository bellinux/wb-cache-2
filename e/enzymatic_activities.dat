The second objective was to evaluate the browning capacity of the grape must during the alcoholic fermentation stage and in the resulting wine.

40|$|Although enzymes from thermophiles {{thriving}} in hot habitats are {{more stable than}} their mesophilic homologs, they are often less active at low temperatures. One theory suggests that extra stabilizing interactions found in thermophilic enzymes may increase their rigidity and decrease <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activity</b> at lower temperatures. We used acylphosphatase as a model to study how flexibility affects <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activity.</b> This enzyme has a unique structural feature in that an invariant arginine residue, which takes part in catalysis, is restrained by a salt-bridge in the thermophilic homologs but not in its mesophilic homologs.
