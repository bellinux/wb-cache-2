5|$|It {{is likely}} that the castle evolved from the {{practice}} of fortifying a lordly home. The greatest threat to a lord's home or hall was fire as it was usually a wooden structure. To protect against this, and keep other threats at bay, there were several courses of action available: create encircling earthworks to keep an enemy at a distance; build the hall in stone; or raise <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> an artificial mound, known as a motte, to present an obstacle to attackers. While the concept of ditches, ramparts, and stone walls as defensive measures is ancient, raising a motte is a medieval innovation.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} stories were both seen in Medieval- and Renaissance {{theology}} as prefiguring the Crucifixion of Jesus. In {{the story of}} the Brazen Serpent, the people of Israel become dissatisfied and grumble at God. As punishment they receive a plague of venonous snakes. God offers the people relief by instructing Moses to make a snake of brass and set <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a pole, the sight of which gives miraculous healing. Michelangelo chooses a crowded composition, depicting a dramatic mass of suffering men, women, and writhing snakes, separated from redeemed worshipers by the snake before an epiphanic light.|$|E
5|$|Mo Tae-bum {{was born}} in Seoul to father Mo Yeong-yeol and mother Jeong Yeon-hwa in 1989. He has one elder sister, Mo Eun-yeong. Mo started skating when his father {{suggested}} it {{while he was in}} third grade at Eunseok Elementary School. His participation in the school skating team led him to win a cup from rival Lila Elementary School, which had dominated the age group at that time. Since then, Mo has been a close friend to Lee Seung-hoon, a fellow speed skater who also won a silver and a gold medal from the 2010 Winter Olympics. As Mo grew older, he almost gave up skating but, after three years of indecision, he decided against giving <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the advice of his mother. Mo and his family currently live in the city of Pocheon, Gyeonggi province.|$|E

5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Virginia Tech in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a second-and-nine at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Druckenmiller completed a 20-yard pass to Oxendine for a first down at the Tech 40-yard line. Parker ran for three yards, but Tech was forced to call a timeout before the next play. During the timeout, a light rain began to fall that would last through {{the remainder of the}} game. Coming out of the timeout, Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass, but made <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the next play by rushing for 16 yards, picking up a first down at the 41-yard line of Nebraska. This was followed by another rush by Druckenmiller, this time for nine yards. The two gains were negated on the next play, however, as Virginia Tech committed a penalty that pushed the Hokies back to their 41-yard line. Druckenmiller then threw two incomplete passes, and Tech was forced to punt.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} Adam and Rachel having sex {{in a shop}} window in the third episode, {{inspired}} by one of Bullen's ex-girlfriends, was filmed in an empty shop unit near Piccadilly station. The unit was dressed {{to look like a}} charity shop, with various items and the bed added. Mylod and the stunt co-ordinator storyboarded the sequence where the car comes through the shop window before setting <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> location. Nesbitt and Baxendale were switched with stunt doubles and the car was propelled up a ramp through the window. Explosive charges were placed on the glass to achieve a shatter effect. As only one take could be done, Mylod trailed five cameras on the window. Filming ran from 8p.m. to 6a.m. the following day. The location was near several clubs and many passers-by inquired what was being filmed. To avoid giving away the plot they were told that Baxendale was filming a bed advertisement, capitalising on her exposure from appearing in Friends. Baxendale selected the lingerie Rachel wears in that episode herself, buying £2,000 worth from the Janet Reger outlet in Knightsbridge, London.|$|E

25|$|The Constitution {{was passed}} by the Imperial Parliament, and came into effect on 1 January 1901. However, the High Court was not {{established}} immediately; it was necessary for the new Parliament of Australia to make laws about the structure and procedure of the court. Some {{of the members of the}} First Parliament, including Sir John Quick, then one of the leading legal experts in Australia, opposed legislation to set up the court. Even H. B. Higgins, who was himself later appointed to the court, objected to setting <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> <b>on</b> the grounds that it would be impotent while Privy Council appeals remained, and that in any event there was not enough work for a federal court to make it viable.|$|E
25|$|At the time, modems {{generally}} came in two versions, {{one for the}} end-user {{that required}} the user to dial the phone manually and use an acoustic coupler for connection, and another dedicated to answering incoming calls that was intended for use on the minicomputer or mainframe the user was calling into. The connection and disconnection was entirely manual, with the user picking up the phone's handset, dialing manually, and then pressing the handset into the coupler if a carrier frequency was heard. Disconnecting {{at the end of}} the session was also manual, with the user lifting the handset out of the coupler and hanging <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the phone body in order to depress the hook switch and return the phone to the on-hook state and end the call.|$|E

25|$|Graden {{sent the}} film on a VHS to several {{industry}} executives in Hollywood; meanwhile, someone digitized the clip and put <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the Internet, where it {{became one of}} the very first viral videos. As Jesus vs. Santa became more popular, Parker and Stone began talks of developing the short into a television series. Fox refused to pick up the series, not wanting to air a show that included the character Mr. Hankey, a talking piece of feces. The two were initially skeptical of possible television deals, noting that previous endeavors had not turned out successful. The two then entered negotiations with both MTV and Comedy Central. Parker preferred the show be produced by Comedy Central, fearing that MTV would turn it into a kids' show. When Comedy Central executive Doug Herzog watched the short, he commissioned the development of the show into a series.|$|E
25|$|On 13 August 1918, Lt. Hamilton led {{his flight}} {{on a special}} mission against Varssenaere aerodrome. He dropped four bombs from 200 feet on some {{aeroplane}} hangars, making two direct hits and causing {{a large amount of}} damage. He then machine gunned the German officers' billets and made four circuits of the aerodrome, shooting up various targets. On the first circuit, he destroyed one EA on the ground which burst into flames when he shot <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> <b>On</b> the third circuit he repeated this performance, setting afire another Fokker biplane. His dash and skill very materially helped in the success of the operation. In addition this officer destroyed a Fokker biplane over Armentières on 7 August 1918. On 12 July he brought down two EA in flames and on two other occasions has driven down out of control enemy machines. He is an excellent patrol leader.|$|E
25|$|The series {{switched}} to Chicago for game three. There was some debate who would start for Tampa Bay, but regular starter Ben Bishop started {{the game for}} Tampa Bay. For {{the third time in}} a row, Tampa Bay struck first, on Ryan Callahan's slapshot goal at 5:09 of the first. Brad Richards tied <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a power-play goal and the teams were tied after the first period. The first period was dominated by Chicago, who outshot Tampa Bay 19–7. The second period was dominated by Tampa Bay, which outshot Chicago 17–7, but there was no scoring. In the third period, Brandon Saad gave Chicago its first lead at 4:14, but Tampa Bay countered on the next shift on a goal by Ondrej Palat to tie the score once again. Late in the third period, Victor Hedman led a rush down ice for Tampa Bay and passed to Cedric Paquette who scored to put the Lightning ahead again. The Lightning were able to defend their lead to win the game 3–2 and take a series lead two games to one.|$|E

A tear gas canister was detonated among the female worshippers, which caused events to escalate. On 12 October 1990 Palestinian Muslims protested violently the intention of some extremist Jews to lay a cornerstone on the site for a New Temple {{as a prelude to}} the destruction of the Muslim mosques. The attempt was blocked by Israeli authorities but demonstrators were widely reported as having stoned Jews at the Western Wall. According to Palestinian historian Rashid Khalidi, investigative journalism has shown this allegation to be false. Rocks were eventually thrown, while security forces fired rounds that ended up killing 21 people and injuring 150 more. An Israeli inquiry found Israeli forces at fault, but it also concluded that charges could not be brought against any particular individuals. In December 1997, Israeli security services preempted an attempt by Jewish extremists to throw a pig's head wrapped {{in the pages of the}} Quran into the area, in order to spark a riot and embarrass the government.|$|E
25|$|In {{the opening}} {{game of the}} next series, against the Padres, Kershaw allowed only one run in 6 innings while {{striking}} out 11 and left with a one-run lead. The bullpen allowed two runs in the eighth to blow the lead but the Dodgers retook {{the lead in the}} bottom of the inning and they won 4–3. In the following game, Zack Greinke pitched an eight-inning complete game but the Dodgers offense failed to score more than a single run and a solo homer by Justin Upton in the eighth inning gave the Padres a 2–1 win. In the series finale, the Padres jumped out to a 2–0 lead in the fifth but the Dodgers tied <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a solo homer by Andre Ethier and an RBI double by Adrian Gonzalez. Pederson made a tough catch on a long line drive by Upton in the ninth to send the game into extra innings where the Dodgers won the game 4–2 on a two-run single by Gonzalez in the 12th. The team next traveled to Globe Life Park in Arlington, Texas for a short series against the Texas Rangers. Carlos Frías pitched five scoreless innings to start the game, but fell apart in the sixth when the Rangers scored four runs to win the game 4–1. The offense remained lifeless the following day, unable to score against rookie Chi Chi Gonzalez until Justin Turner tied the game up with a two-run homer in the top of the ninth. However, Robinson Chirinos hit a walk-off homer off Josh Ravin {{in the bottom of the}} inning and the Rangers swept the brief two-game series with a 3–2 win.|$|E

In the opener, the Rays jumped out to a 6-0 lead and David Price allowed only one unearned run through his seven innings. However, the Dodgers rallied against the Rays bullpen with two runs in the eighth and four in the ninth to win 7-6. Zack Greinke pitched 6 1/3 scoreless innings, Adrian Gonzalez homered, Skip Schumaker had four hits and the Dodgers won the second game of the series, 5-0. Clayton Kershaw dominated in the series finale, striking out eight and allowing just 3 hits and 1 earned run in 8 strong innings, while driving in 2 runs on a second-inning single. The Dodgers won 8-2. The next day, they beat the New York Mets 4-2 as Nick Punto homered and Gonzalez had three hits and an RBI. The Dodgers record of 38-8 over their past 46 games was the franchise's best mark since the 1899 Brooklyn Superbas. Ryu pitched another good game the following day, beating Mets ace Matt Harvey {{to pick up his}} 12th win in the Dodgers 4-2 victory. On August 14, the Dodgers fell behind early 4-0 after 3 innings but again fought their way back and tied <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a two-run pinch hit homer by Andre Ethier {{in the bottom of the}} ninth. Back-to-back doubles by Yasiel Puig and Gonzalez in the 12th gave them a 5-4 walk-off win. This was the 12th straight victory for the Dodgers in one-run games, a franchise record, and their 40th win in 48 games, the best mark in the Majors since the 1942 St. Louis Cardinals.|$|E
