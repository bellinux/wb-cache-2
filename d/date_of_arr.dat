40|$|The Arabidopsis two-component {{signaling}} system, {{which is}} comprised of sensor histidine kinases, histidine phosphotransfer proteins, and response regulators, mediates cytokinin response as well as various other plant responses including abiotic stress responses. Arabidopsis response regulators (ARRs) are classified into type-A, -B, and -C. Although the roles of type-A and -B ARRs are well established in Arabidopsis plant signaling, roles <b>of</b> type-C <b>ARRs,</b> ARR 22 and ARR 24, remain elusive. ARR 22, a preferentially cytosolic protein, interacts with certain Arabidopsis histidine phosphotransfer proteins (AHPs) and displays phosphatase activity on AHP 5. ARR 22 is induced by cold and dehydration. Here, we show that inducible overexpression <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> 22 in Arabidopsis enhanced dehydration, drought, and cold tolerance in a dexamethasone-dependent manner, whereas mutation of the putative phospho-accepting Asp to Asn in ARR 22 (ARR 22 (D 74 N)) abolished these tolerance phenotypes. Overexpression <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> 22 decreased electrolyte leakage in dehydration-, drought-, or cold-stressed transgenic Arabidopsis plants compared with that <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> 22 (D 74 N) or compared with wild-type plants. Transpiration rates and stomatal apertures were not affected by ARR 22 overexpression. No significant difference in both dehydration and freezing tolerance was observed between wild-type and arr 22 mutants with or without cytokinin preincubation, consistent with the lack <b>of</b> phenotypes <b>of</b> <b>arr</b> 22 mutants in their vegetative development. Meta-profile analyses of the microarray data on ARR 22 -responsive genes indicate that ARR 22 modulates expression {{of a variety of}} abiotic stress-responsive genes, which might contribute to increasing drought and freezing tolerance. Taken together, these results suggest that ARR 22 plays a positive role in the stress tolerance response in part via enhancing cell membrane integrity and that phospho-histidine phosphatase activity <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> 22 may be required for this function...|$|R

40|$|Phytohormones have a {{great impact}} on plant growth and development. Cytokinins are one {{phytohormone}} class which is involved {{in the development of the}} shoot and root meristem, the leaf senescence and the development of chloroplasts. An aim of this thesis has been the identification of potential cis-regulatory elements involved in the cytokinintransduction. Promoter deletion analysis <b>of</b> the type-A <b>ARR</b> gene ARR 6 in protoplast-trans-activation assays (PTAs) identified a 27 bp long DNA-fragment which mediates part of the cytokinin signal. After expression and purification of the DNA-binding domain <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> 1 in E. coli it was shown that GST:ARR 1 -DBD could not bind to the 27 bp DNA-fragment in vitro. Yeast one-hybrid screens with the promoter <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> 6 should identify potential trans-factors for the 27 bp fragment. Among others these screens identified Light Sensitive Hypocotyl 3 (LSH 3). Despite the lack of binding to the ARR 6 promoter in gel shift assays it could be shown that LSH 3 represses the transactivation capacity <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> 1 in vivo and that this effect can be reverted by application of exogenous cytokinin. In tobacco leafs transiently expressed GFP-fusions showed a nuclear localization for LSH 3. Overexpressors of LSH 3 resulted in plants with a reduced number of lateral roots and a strongly impaired germination on media containing paclobutrazole, an inhibitor of gibberellin synthesis. The overexpression of LSH 3 in the background <b>of</b> the <b>arr</b> 10 arr 12 mutant resulted in dwarfed plants which resemble the arr 1 arr 10 arr 12 phenotype. Analysis <b>of</b> the <b>ARR</b> 1 transcript level in the LSH 3 overexpressors points toward a regulatory mechanism for LSH 3 at the posttranscriptional level. Protein-protein interaction studies with the yeast two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed no interaction between LSH 3 and any of the type-B nor type-A ARR. Yeast two-hybrid studies identified the transcription factor WRKY 6 as an interaction partner for LSH 3 and ARR 1. Functional studies for WRKY 6 in PTA experiments showed no effect on the transcriptional capacity <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> 1 without cytokinin. However, overexpression of WRKY 6 could completely reverse the negative effect on the ARR 1 transactivation capacity caused by LSH 3.

METHODS: Radiographic images obtained from 58 patients, before (T 1) and after orthodontic treatment (T 2), and following 52 - 288 months of treatment were analyzed by {{three members of the}} Brazilian Board of Orthodontics. Apical structures were evaluated by PR images (T 2 and T 3), using Levander and Malmgren scores. The presence <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> on CBCT images were detected only at T 3. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used for statistical analyses, and the level of significance was set at 5 %. Kappa statistics determined interobserver agreement. RESULTS: The more frequent ARR were with scores 1 in T 2 (51. 6 %) and T 3 (53. 1 %), when evaluated by PR (p > 0. 05). When compared the frequencies <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> in T 3 among PR and CBCT images, the differences were significant for maxillary and mandibular pre-molar groups, and for mandibular molar group (p > 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract Background The Arabidopsis {{response}} regulator 22 (ARR 22) {{is one of}} {{two members}} of a recently defined novel group of two-component system (TCS) elements. TCSs are stimulus perception and response modules of prokaryotic origin, which signal by a His-to-Asp phosphorelay mechanism. In plants, TCS regulators are involved in hormone response pathways, such as those for cytokinin and ethylene. While the functions of the other TCS elements in Arabidopsis, such as histidine kinases (AHKs), histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins (AHPs) and A-type and B-type ARRs are becoming evident, the role <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> 22 is poorly understood. Results We present evidence that ARR 22 is a preferentially cytoplasmic protein, exclusively expressed in the chalaza <b>of</b> developing seeds. <b>ARR</b> 22 specifically interacts with AHP 2, AHP 3 and AHP 5 in yeast and living plant cells. Two new loss-of-function alleles, arr 22 - 2 and arr 22 - 3, were isolated and characterized. With respect to their morphology and metabolite status, {{no significant difference in the}} developing seeds <b>of</b> the <b>arr</b> 22 mutants was observed compared to wild type. The genetic complementation <b>of</b> the <b>arr</b> 22 mutants with a genomic ARR 22 fragment resulted in plants (arr 22 / gARR 22) with a pleiotropic phenotype of different penetrance. This phenotype was not observed when the phosphorylatable Asp 74 <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> 22 was changed to either a dominant-active Glu or a dominant-inactive Asn. The phenotype <b>of</b> the <b>arr</b> 22 / gARR 22 plants was comparable to that of multiple ahk, ahp and B-type arr mutants. Conclusion Our results favor the model that ARR 22 acts as a phospho-histidine phosphatase on specific AHPs in the cytoplasm of Arabidopsis chalaza cells. The lack of any aberrant morphological and metabolite phenotype in the seeds <b>of</b> the <b>arr</b> 22 mutants indicates that ARR 22 is probably primarily responsible for the fine tuning of specific branches of chalaza-based TCS signalling. Even when slightly mis-expressed, ARR 22 interferes with hormone homeostasis in non-chalaza tissues. Our data indicate that the chromatin status might play a crucial role in maintaining the chalaza-restricted expression <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> 22. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective　To {{explore the}} {{potential}} influence of gender on screening value <b>of</b> aldosterone-renin ratio (<b>ARR)</b> for primary aldosteronism (PA). Methods　The biochemical parameters were collected of 451 PA patients and 300 essential hypertension (EH) {{patients who were}} diagnosed in the General Hospital of PLA from 1992 to 2014. Each group was then {{divided into two groups}} by gender. The clinical characteristics were compared and then the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was conducted to evaluate the best cut-off value. Results　The plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), serum sodium and ARR were much higher, but the plasma rennin activity (PRA), serum potassium and BMI were much lower in PA patients than in EH patients (P 0. 05). The best cut-off value <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> in male PA patients was 19. 11, the relevant area under the curve (AUC) was 0. 968, the sensitivity and specificity was 92. 44 % and 93. 08 %, and the Youden index (YI) was 0. 86. The best cut-off value <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> in female PA patients was 27. 26, with AUC 0. 956, sensitivity 92. 07 %, specificity 90. 00 % and YI 0. 82, respectively. If the cut-off value was set at 27. 26 in males, the specificity would rise a little, but the sensitivity and YI would sharply decrease. Similarly, the sensitivity would increase a little but the specificity and YI would fall substantially if the cut-off value in females was set at 19. 11. The best cut-off value <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> in men was smaller than the official value recommended by guidelines. Conclusion　Gender is an important factor should be considered while ARR is used in PA screening, and the cut-off value <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> in screening female PA patients should be setting higher.

40|$|Hormones are {{important}} regulators of plant growth and development. In Arabidopsis, {{perception of the}} phytohormones ethylene and cytokinin is accomplished by a family of sensor histidine kinases including ethylene-resistant (ETR) 1 and cytokinin-response (CRE) 1. We identified the Arabidopsis response regulator 2 (ARR 2) as a signalling component functioning downstream of ETR 1 in ethylene signal transduction. Analyses <b>of</b> loss-of-function and <b>ARR</b> 2 -overexpressing lines as well as functional assays in protoplasts indicate an important role <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> 2 in mediating ethylene responses. Additional investigations indicate that an ETR 1 -initiated phosphorelay regulates the transcription factor activity <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> 2. This mechanism may create a novel signal transfer from endoplasmic reticulum-associated ETR 1 to the nucleus for the regulation of ethylene-response genes.

40|$|The A-type {{response}} regulator ARR 4 is {{an element}} in the two-component signalling network <b>of</b> Arabidopsis. <b>ARR</b> 4 interacts with the N-terminus of the red/far-red light photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB) and func-tions as a modulator of photomorphogenesis. In con-cert with other A-type response regulators, ARR 4 also participates in the modulation of the cytokinin response pathway. Here evidence is presented that ARR 4 directly modulates the activity state of phyB in planta, not only under inductive but also under extended irradiation with red light. Mutation of the phosphorylatable aspar-tate to asparagine within the receiver domain creates a version <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> 4 that negatively affects photomorpho-genesis. Additional evidence suggests that ARR 4 activ-ity is regulated by a phosphorelay mechanism {{that depends on the}} AHK family of cytokinin receptors. Accordingly, the ability <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> 4 to function on phyB is modified by exogenous application of cytokinin.

40|$|SummaryBackground: Arrestins are pivotal, {{multifunctional}} {{organizers of}} cell responses to GPCR stimulation, including cell survival and cell death. In Drosophila norpA and rdgC mutants, endocytosis of abnormally stable complexes of rhodopsin (Rh 1) and fly photoreceptor Arrestin 2 (Arr 2) triggers cell death, implicating Rh 1 /Arr 2 -bearing endosomes in pro-cell death signaling, potentially via arrestin-mediated GPCR activation of effector kinase pathways. In order to further investigate arrestin function in photoreceptor physiology and survival, we studied Arr 2 ’s partner photoreceptor arrestin, Arr 1, {{in developing and}} adult Drosophila compound eyes. Results: We report that Arr 1, but not Arr 2, is essential for normal, light-induced rhodopsin endocytosis. Also distinct from Arr 2, Arr 1 is essential for light-independent photoreceptor survival. Photoreceptor cell death caused by loss <b>of</b> <b>Arr</b> 1 is strongly suppressed by coordinate loss <b>of</b> <b>Arr</b> 2. We further find that Rh 1 C-terminal phosphorylation is essential for light-induced endocytosis and also for translocation <b>of</b> <b>Arr</b> 1, but not Arr 2, from dark-adapted photoreceptor cytoplasm to photosensory membrane rhabdomeres. In contrast to a previous report, we do not find a requirement for photoreceptor myosin kinase NINAC in Arr 1 or Arr 2 translocation. Conclusions: The two Drosophila photoreceptor arrestins mediate distinct and essential cell pathways downstream of rhodopsin activation. We propose that Arr 1 mediates an endocytotic cell-survival activity, scavenging phosphorylated rhodopsin and thereby countering toxic Arr 2 /Rh 1 accumulation; elimination <b>of</b> toxic <b>Arr</b> 2 /Rh 1 in double mutants could thus rescue arr 1 mutant photoreceptor degeneration...|$|R

The interaction between Arr 2 and NINAC was PI dependent and NINAC bound directly to PIs.

The causes of these changes are not clear. We consider a better understanding of this phenomenon essential for valuing the effects of new drugs and by designing new trials. OBJECTIVES: To identify predictive factors <b>of</b> on-study <b>ARR</b> in early and recent MS trials. METHODS: <b>ARR,</b> rate <b>of</b> relapse-free patients, trial start dates, baseline demographics, relapse definitions and the use of McDonald criteria were retrieved by literature research of the placebo cohorts from RRMS phase- 3 trials. Predictors were estimated by univariate and multivariate regression analyses and random-effects meta-regression. In addition, regression models were calculated by the Sylvia Lawry Centre's (SLC), including individual case data from clinical trials performed until 2000. The most reliable meta-analytic results can be gained from pooled individual case data. In lack of this, random-effects meta-analyses are recommended. RESULTS: Data from 12 published and one unpublished trial show a decrease <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> from 1988 to 2012 (adjR(2)  =  0. 807, p< 0. 0001). Regression models identified McDonald criteria followed by baseline mean age and the pre-study relapse rate as predictors <b>of</b> the <b>ARR.</b> The pooled individual case data (n =  505) confirmed a decrease <b>of</b> <b>ARR</b> over time. The pre-study relapse rate was the best predictor for on-study relapses.
