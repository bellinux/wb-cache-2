He did his {{schooling}} at the Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, NY, where he developed a strong interest in physics, chemistry and mathematics. His aptitude in physics and mathematics led him to the Columbia University Science Honors Program. He moved on to Harvard University to complete his undergraduate education, earning an A. B. with distinguished honors (cum laude) in Physics and Chemistry in 1997. Inspired by superconductivity and superconducting circuits during his summer internship at HYPRES, Inc., he enrolled at Yale University for doctoral studies, where his graduate work focused mainly on aluminum hot-electron bolometers. Upon receiving his Ph.D. in 2002, he was awarded a postdoctoral research fellowship at Yale for work on superconducting qubits. His post-doctoral work resulted with the development of the Josephson quantum <b>electron</b> <b>pump</b> or a Josephson Bifurcation Amplifier, which makes use of the non-dissipative, non-linear nature of the Josephson junction to realize high gain and minimal back action measurements of quantum systems.
