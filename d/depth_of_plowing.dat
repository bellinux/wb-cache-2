40|$|From the {{standpoint}} of amount of dry matter and nitrogen added to the soil and the eradication of the plants, sweet clover may best be plowed for corn about April 25 to May 5. The five dates of harvest used rank as follows in yield of dry matter for tops and roots: May 3 - 18, Nov. 1 - 13, Oct. 1, April 9 - 13 and Sept. 1. Nitrogen yields rank {{in much the same}} order. Of the total for tops and roots, the tops contained 68 percent of the dry matter and 73 percent of the nitrogen in September, 51 and 48 percent, respectively, in October, 29 and 18 in November, 24 and 28 in April and 69 and 74 in May. In September the tops contained 3. 5 percent nitrogen and the roots 2. 8, October 3. 0 and 3. 4, respectively, November 2. 1 and · 3. 9, April 5. 4 and 4. 5 and May 3. 4 and 2. 6. In April the roots contained 61 percent as much dry matter and 69 percent as much nitrogen as in November. In April, however, tops and roots together contained 80 percent as much dry matter and 96 percent as much nitrogen as the roots alone in November. White sweet clover was superior to yellow in yield of dry matter in the tops, while yellow was superior to white for roots. For tops and roots there was little difference. Yellow survived somewhat more than white, but the difference was small. Plowing Sept. 1 killed nearly all of the sweet clover but with a sacrifice of approximately one-half of the dry matter and nitrogen. Plowing in October and November caused costly eradication problems since approximately 20 plants per square yard survived. The Pulverator plow was less effective than the ordinary plow in exterminating the clover for September, October, November and April plowings. A <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>plowing</b> recognized as providing good tillage practice is to be preferred. Draft requirements were in direct proportion to the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>plowing,</b> and the ordinary plow required practically the same amount of draft as the Pulverator. Draft required increased progressively for September, October and November plowings, dropped sharply for April and increased for May over April. Pasturing yellow sweet clover from Aug. 15 on reduced the survival nearly 50 percent. Plants buried by hand survived directly in proportion to length of roots for 1, 3, 5 and 7 -inch lengths, and inversely in proportion to depths of burying for 3, 5 and 7 -inches. Fewer of the small roots survived than of the large ones. Plants transplanted in normal position had an average of eight buds per plant. On the plants that survived 51 percent of the buds produced shoots. Under field conditions there were approximately two shoots per plant. Large roots had more buds than small ones, but practically the same percentage of buds grew from large roots as from small ones. Following dormancy buds did not grow at temperatures of 28 and 30 ° F., increased an average of 0. 5 cm. in length in 32 days at 36 °, 1 cm. at 40 ° and 4 cm. at 50 °...|$|E
40|$|Limitations {{on water}} {{infiltration}} and soil aeration through compaction processes {{have the potential}} to limit production in irrigated agricultural fields. This project was conducted to determine the impact of sub-soiling with a paraplow (Howard Rotavator) on soil physical properties and processes that are important in affecting soil-water relations and productivity. The paraplow was the subsoiler selected for use in this study because of its ability to loosen the soil at the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>plowing</b> while producing minimal surface disturbance. The research plots were located on Chernozem and Vertisol soils in the Brown soil zone in the Lake Diefenbaker irrigation district near Birsay, SK. Irrigated and dryland sites were used for comparison. Sub-soiling was able to consistently reduce bulk density of the soil and effects persisted for one to two years under normal precipitation conditions. Excessively wet conditions (2010 and 2011) reduced the effectiveness of the sub-soiling. Tillage induced porosity in the soil was associated with a greater infiltration capacity measured in the field. Yield benefits in crops grown (canola, flax, wheat) from sub-soiling were variable under the wet conditions of 2010 and 2011. A greater benefit was observed under the normal precipitation conditions of 2012 on sites that were paraplowed in 2011. Subsoiling at a depth of 45 cm and a row spacing of 45 cm (manufacturer’s recommended configuration) was more effective than shallower depth and wider row spacing treatments. A significant yield benefit was only observed at the dryland site established in 2011, and limited yield benefit was observed in the irrigated sites. Over the three years of the study, annual yields from sub-soiling were on average about 5 % higher than the un-tilled control. However, yield benefits were variable depending on crop and year. Given an estimated cost of subsoiling of ~$ 30 per acre, a benefit of sub-soiling that lasts one year would produce close to break-even conditions, and sub-soiling benefits that are consistent and last longer than one year are needed to be cost effective...|$|E

40|$|The present {{trend of}} {{disposing}} treated sewage water by {{allowing it to}} infiltrate the soil brings {{a new dimension to}} environmental problems. It is therefore necessary to identify the chemicals likely to be present in treated sewage water. A soil column experiment was conducted to determine the behavior of chemical species in soil columns applied with secondary treated sewage water. To predict the behavior of chemical species, a multicomponent solute transport model that includes the biochemical redox process and cation exchange process was developed. The model computes changes in concentration over time caused by the processes of advection, dispersion, biochemical reactions and cation exchange reactions. The solute transport model was able to predict the behavior of different chemical species in the soil column applied with secondary treated sewage water. The model reproduced the sequential reduction reaction. To design the safe <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>plow</b> layer where NO^-_ 3 is totally reduced, a numerical study of NO^-_ 3 leach was done and it was found out that the pore velocity and concentration of CH_ 2 O at the inject water was found to affect NO^-_ 3 reduction in the mobile pore water phase.

The curved surface of the plough body was measured with a 3 D bench then it was constructed with SolidWorks design software. An elastoplastic constitutive model was used for the soil. The constructed surface was inputted to Abaqus software as a discrete rigid body with a reference point {{at the tip of the}} moldboard. At this tip the reaction force with its three orthogonal components was calculated. The influence of the cutting angles of the plough body on the draught force was studied.

40|$|The {{negative}} trend of soil degradation process increases with intensive agricultural production. Therefore, {{there is a}} need for soil conditioning like liming, humification, fertilization, etc. to improve soil quality. One of the major problems that occur on agricultural soils of Croatia is acidification. A downward trend of soil pH is mainly present in soils of poor structure with intensive agricultural production. In agricultural practice liming often needs to rely only on the pH value, without determining the hydrolytic acidity, CEC or soil texture. Due to the above mentioned facts, calculation of liming for Osijek-Baranja County was conducted with the help of ALRxp calculator, which takes CEC, soil pH in KCl, hydrolytic acidity, bulk density of soil, soil textural class and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>plow</b> layer to 30 cm into account. Low soil pH values have a great influence on soil suitability for crops as well as on the deficit of calcium and magnesium. All of these lead to the degradation of soil structure, and can even lead to disturbances of plant nutrition in some production areas. On such soils, liming would be imperatively required, but with caution because an excessive intake of lime materials, especially without the necessary analysis, causes a decline in organic matter and reduces accessibility for plant uptake of microelements...|$|R
40|$|Tillage or plowing {{quality is}} usually {{evaluated}} by the soil bulk density and distribution of organic matter. Soil bulk density, which is the sign of compactness and porosity in turn, depends on type of implements, soil organic carbon, tillage method and plowing depth. Plowing depth causes a lot of pulling in tractors {{and in order to}} have deep plowings, heavy-duty tractors are needed. To determine the optimum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> moldboard <b>plow,</b> the bulk density and soil organic carbon of cultivated soil were investigated in this research. The experiments were conducted, using a three-bottom plow with three plowing depths and four <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> soil, in a split plot design, which lasted for three years. Main plots, consisted <b>of</b> three <b>plowing</b> methods (shallow ~= 12 cm, semi-deep ~= 22 cm and deep tillage ~= 32 cm) and subplots, consisted <b>of</b> four soil <b>depths</b> (0 - 10, 10 - 20, 20 - 30 and 30 - 40 cm). The amounts of soil density, soil organic carbon, soil water infiltration and crop yields were measured. The results showed that, deep tillage had the greatest effects on soil densities, soil organic carbon, infiltration rates and crop yields. Mean value of soil bulk density was 1. 65 g cm - 3 in shallow tillage which decreased by increasing the plowing depth to 1. 53 and 1. 151 g cm - 3 in semi-deep and deep tillage, respectively. However, soil bulk density associated with deep tillage was generally higher than that of semi-deep tillage but the differences between the semi-deep and deep tillage were not significant. The soil water infiltration increased from 1. 234 cm h - 1, in shallow tillage to 1. 405 cm h - 1 in deep tillage. Crop yield by the deep tillage was 6571 kg ha - 1, while the semi-deep tillage and shallow tillage yield were 6389 and 5717 kg ha - 1, respectively. By increasing the plowing depth, the soil organic carbon and crop yields improved but {{there were no significant differences}} between the semi-deep and deep tillage system...|$|R

At an altitude of 506 m it is a variant <b>of</b> <b>plowing.</b> At an altitude of 520 m it is a variant of minimization. Two lands were chosen to present minimization process at one of them and classical plowing process at the second of them. Soil pits were dug in both versions and a description of soil profiles according to the Comprehensive Survey Methodology of Agricultural Soils (NĚMEČEK 1967) was carried. Intact soil samples were taken in ten terms, four replications, from the depths (center roller) : 5 cm, 17 cm and 30 cm. Bulk samples were taken also from these depths (range 10 cm). The average volume of macroaggregates (> 0. 5 mm) was reduced during the experiment from 39, 67 % in 2012 to 33, 52 % in 2014 in a variant <b>of</b> <b>plowing.</b> The average volume in a variant of minimization changed only minimally. The volume of microaggregates in a variant <b>of</b> <b>plowing</b> incereased during the years. This volume was amounted to 3, 71 % in 2002, while in 2014 the figure was 4, 21 %. The volume of microaggregates decreased in a variant of minimization from 4, 18 % in 2012 to mere 2, 51 % in 2014. The influence of basic tillage to bulk density was not statistically proven however there was extreme compaction found at the <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> 30 cm in both versions. Statistically highly significant effect of basic agrotechnics on total porosity was found.
