25|$|The {{idea was}} the pancreas's <b>internal</b> <b>secretion,</b> which, it was supposed, regulates {{sugar in the}} bloodstream, might {{hold the key to}} the {{treatment}} of diabetes.

25|$|At {{the end of}} 1920, Macleod was {{approached}} by Frederick Grant Banting, a young Canadian physician who had the idea of curing diabetes using an extract from a pancreas whose functioning had been disrupted. Macleod was not enthusiastic, because (unlike Banting) he knew about unsuccessful experiments in this direction by other researchers. He thought {{it more likely that}} the nervous system had a crucial role in regulating blood glucose concentration. Even though Banting had virtually no experience of physiology, he managed to convince Macleod to lend him laboratory space during a vacation in Scotland that summer. In addition to the laboratory, Macleod provided experimental animals and his student Charles Herbert Best, who worked as a demonstrator. Macleod also advised on project planning and the use of analytical techniques, and assisted with the operation on the first dog. While Macleod was away, Banting and Best achieved a breakthrough: they isolated an <b>internal</b> <b>secretion</b> of the pancreas and succeeded in reducing the blood sugar level of another dog, whose pancreas had been surgically removed.|$|E

50|$|Brunner {{is remembered}} for his {{experiments}} and {{studies of the}} pancreas and the <b>internal</b> <b>secretions</b> associated with that organ. In 1683 he removed the pancreas from a dog and noticed that the animal experienced extreme thirst and polyuria. Despite his intuitive grasp {{of the connection between}} the pancreas and diabetes, he was unable to provide a theoretical link for the role of the pancreas in that disease. He published his findings on pancreatic research in a treatise titled Experimenta Nova circa Pancreas. Accedit diatribe de lympha & genuino pancreatis usu.|$|R

They argued bitterly, but Banting finally accepted Macleod's instruction that further experiments were needed, and he even convinced Macleod to provide better working conditions and to give him and Best a salary. Further experiments were successful and the three started to present their work at meetings. Macleod was a far better orator, and Banting came to believe that he wanted to take all the credit. Their discovery was first published in the February 1922 issue of The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine. Macleod declined co-authorship because he considered it Banting's and Best's work. Despite their success, there remained the issue of how to get enough pancreas extract to continue the experiments. Together, the three researchers developed alcohol extraction, which proved to be far more efficient than other methods. This convinced Macleod to divert the whole laboratory to insulin research and to bring in the biochemist James Collip to help with purifying the extract.|$|E

40|$|In {{summarizing}} {{the findings of}} this paper it may be said that degenerative changes have been noted in practically every parenchymatous organ. Among these the most striking has been that of serous imbibition by the most active cells of these organs. In regard to the changes in the glands of <b>internal</b> <b>secretion,</b> the findings corroborate the statements of Cushing in regard to hypophysectomy, that removal of one gland of <b>internal</b> <b>secretion</b> results in changes in all the other glands. In this case, degenerative changes predominate in the hypophysis, thymus, ovary, and testis, while hyperplasia is seen in the islands of Langerhans and the medullas of the adrenal glands. Finally, in the rabbit athyroidism is responsible for grave degenerative changes in practically all organs and tissues of the body, and many of the symptoms of cretinism have an anatomical basis in organic cellular changes...|$|E

50|$|Henry Robert Harrower, MD (1883-1934) was a {{controversial}} early figure in endocrinology, {{and the author}} of several books and many papers on the subject. He was the impetus for the foundation of the Association for the Study of <b>Internal</b> <b>Secretions,</b> now called The Endocrine Society, and edited the first two editions of their journal Endocrinology. He was known for his advocacy of organotherapy, which involved consuming various glands and at times other parts of the body. He experienced financial success for this practice. Endocrinologists disdained these practices, believing that only the thyroid gland could have a meaningful effect when consumed orally. Harrower's organotherapy was the subject of repeated criticism. As he was the main proponent of the movement, it faded after his death.|$|R
50|$|Ellis was {{strongly}} {{opposed to the}} idea of castration for eugenic purposes. In 1909, regulations were introduced at the Cantonal Asylum in Bern, which allowed those deemed ‘unfit’ and with strong sexual inclinations to be mandatorily sterilized. In a particular instance, several men and women, including epileptics and pedophiles were castrated, some of whom voluntarily requested it. While the results were positive, in that none of the subjects were found guilty of any more sexual offences, Ellis remained staunchly opposed to the practice. His view on the origin of these inclinations was that sexual impulses do not reside in the sexual organs, but rather they persist in the brain. Moreover, he posited that the sexual glands provided an important source of <b>internal</b> <b>secretions</b> vital for the functioning of the organism, and thus their removal could greatly injure the patient.|$|R
40|$|BY the {{beginning}} of the present decade there was enough clinical and experimental evidence to establish the fact that a man's reactions to the situations that he encounters in his daily life may affect a great number of his internal processes. In effect, it was clear that any bodily function sub-ject to the regulation of the central nervous system might be influenced to a significant degree, and that the regulatory influences of the central nervous system might be mediated directly by way of the neural pathways or <b>internal</b> <b>secretions,</b> or indirectly by way of changes in the over-all behavior of the individual. The effects of these, taken together, might lead to notable variations in general activity, energy expenditure, food and fluid intake, sleep patterns and the like, and to important changes in the specific demands made upon various organ systems, especially when such systems are involun-tarily involved in reaction patterns not directly appropriate to the adaptation which the organism is attempting to make. In short, there was a sound theoretic and experimental basis to support the very old clinical observatio...|$|R
