5|$|Acid2 was {{designed}} with Microsoft Internet Explorer particularly in mind. The creators of Acid2 were dismayed that Internet Explorer {{did not follow}} web standards. It was prone to display web pages <b>differently</b> <b>from</b> other browsers, causing web developers to spend time tweaking their web pages. Acid2 challenged Microsoft to make Internet Explorer comply with web standards.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have a blood–brain {{barrier that}} allows metabolism inside {{the brain to}} operate <b>differently</b> <b>from</b> metabolism {{in other parts of}} the body. Glial cells play a major role in brain metabolism by controlling the chemical composition of the fluid that surrounds neurons, including levels of ions and nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Gnostics read John but {{interpreted}} it <b>differently</b> <b>from</b> the way non-Gnostics did. Gnosticism {{taught that}} salvation came from gnosis, secret knowledge, and Gnostics {{did not see}} Jesus as a savior but a revealer of knowledge. Barnabas Lindars asserts that the gospel teaches that salvation can only be achieved through revealed wisdom, specifically belief in (literally belief into) Jesus.|$|E

5|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that infants with a high-risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) may express attachment security <b>differently</b> <b>from</b> infants with a low-risk for ASD. Behavioral problems and social competence in insecure children increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in quality of parenting {{and the degree of}} risk in the family environment.|$|E

5|$|After {{integration}} into the RISC, siRNAs base-pair to their target mRNA and cleave it, thereby preventing it from {{being used as a}} translation template. <b>Differently</b> <b>from</b> siRNA, a miRNA-loaded RISC complex scans cytoplasmic mRNAs for potential complementarity. Instead of destructive cleavage (by Ago2), miRNAs rather target the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) regions of mRNAs where they typically bind with imperfect complementarity, thus blocking the access of ribosomes for translation.|$|E
5|$|Chiral phases {{usually have}} a helical {{twisting}} of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is {{on the order of}} the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond <b>differently</b> <b>from</b> right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as polarization filters.|$|E
5|$|Civilians {{who died}} as a result of enemy action during the Second World War are commemorated <b>differently</b> <b>from</b> those that {{died as a}} result of {{military}} service. They are commemorated by name through the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour located in St George's Chapel in Westminster Abbey. In addition to its mandated duties, the Commission maintains, under arrangement with applicable governments, over 40,000 non-Commonwealth war graves and over 25,000 non-war military and civilian graves.|$|E

5|$|In August 1987, at {{the annual}} B.C. Open hosted at a Holiday Inn in Binghamton, New York, Balukas was slated for {{competition}} in both divisions. After arriving, she discovered that for evening-scheduled matches she {{would be required to}} wear formal attire that she did not have with her. The men's division, by contrast, had no similar dress code. Balukas took a stand that the women should not be treated <b>differently</b> <b>from</b> the men, and accordingly refused to procure garments that would meet the unequal mandate.|$|E
5|$|In graph theory, a {{bipartite graph}} is a graph whose {{vertices}} are {{split into two}} colors, such that neighboring vertices have different colors. If a connected graph has no odd cycles, then a bipartition can be constructed by choosing a base vertex v and coloring every vertex black or white, depending on whether its distance from v is even or odd. Since the distance between v and itself is 0, and 0 is even, the base vertex is colored <b>differently</b> <b>from</b> its neighbors, which lie {{at a distance of}} 1.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{characters}} in Carmen—the soldiers, the smugglers, the Gypsy women and the secondary leads Micaëla and Escamillo—are reasonably familiar types within the opéra comique tradition, although drawing them from proletarian life was unusual. The two principals, José and Carmen, lie outside the genre. While each is presented quite <b>differently</b> <b>from</b> Mérimée's portrayals of a murderous brigand and a treacherous, amoral schemer, even in their relatively sanitised forms neither corresponds to the norms of opéra comique. They are more akin to the verismo style that would find fuller expression in the works of Puccini.|$|E

50|$|The Irish bouzouki, {{with four}} courses, a flatter back, and <b>differently</b> tuned <b>from</b> the Greek bouzouki, {{is a more}} recent development, {{stemming}} from {{the introduction of the}} Greek instrument into Irish music by Johnny Moynihan around 1965, and its subsequent adoption by Andy Irvine, Alec Finn, Dónal Lunny, and many others.|$|R
5|$|The Coatbridge accent {{has been}} {{categorised}} as making less {{use of the}} Scots tongue and exhibiting a tendency to stress the 'a' vowel <b>differently</b> <b>from</b> general Scots usage. Examples of this are seen the pronunciation of the words stair (sterr), hair (herr), fair (ferr) and chair (cherr). This different enunciation {{has been attributed to}} the impact of successive influxes of Ulster Catholic immigrants into Coatbridge. However, the distinctiveness of the Coatbridge accent and pronunciation has diminished as the various surrounding populations (especially Glasgow) have mingled with that of Coatbridge.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{held that}} the plaintiffs lacked locus standi to bring the action as {{they were not the}} temple's legal owners. In any case, as there was {{evidence}} that the authorities had rational reasons for treating the temple property <b>differently</b> <b>from</b> the property of the Mission and the Church, the High Court found that there had been no breach of Article 12(1). Furthermore, the Court determined that the plaintiffs were guilty of inordinate delay in bringing the action.|$|E
5|$|The funeral {{scene at}} the end of the film was also played <b>differently</b> <b>from</b> what was {{originally}} intended. Julie Christie was supposed to wear a veil to hide away her face, but prior to filming Roeg suggested to Christie that she should play it without the veil and smile throughout the scene. Christie was initially sceptical, but Roeg felt it would not make sense for the character to be heartbroken if she believed her husband and daughter were together in the afterlife.|$|E

Nor was he so {{large as the}} Guardian, nor so dignified in demeanor. Indeed, his expression was rather merry and roguish, and as he saw the strangers he gave a short, sharp whistle of surprise.|$|R
5|$|Through the Wilderness is a psychedelic-folk {{tribute to}} Madonna without {{adhering}} {{to any particular}} coherent sound. The cover songs were composed <b>differently</b> <b>from</b> the original versions by the performers; they changed the melody of the Madonna tracks by tweaking the lyrics and re-interpreting the actual meaning. Music critics both complimented and criticized the songs, noting the strength of Madonna's discography in the album's track list.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} the evil Dr. Wily many times, the robotic hero Mega Man is called into action once again when a powerful being known as King steals the blueprints to the creations of Dr. Wily and Dr. Light {{in order to}} create an army for robotic dominance over humans. Having learned of the threat, Mega Man's rival Bass decides to take matters into his own hands. The game is an action-platformer where the player advances by defeating bosses and acquiring their signature weapons. Mega Man & Bass lets the player choose between either of its title characters, each of which plays <b>differently</b> <b>from</b> the other.|$|E
5|$|Although all {{elements}} up to oganesson have been discovered, {{of the elements}} above hassium (element 108), only copernicium (element 112), nihonium (element 113), and flerovium (element 114) have known chemical properties, and only for the copernicium is there enough evidence for a conclusive categorisation at present. The other elements may behave <b>differently</b> <b>from</b> what would be predicted by extrapolation, due to relativistic effects; for example, flerovium has been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, {{even though it is}} currently placed in the carbon group. More recent experiments have suggested, however, that flerovium behaves chemically like lead, as expected from its periodic table position.|$|E
