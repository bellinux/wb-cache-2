5|$|Controversy arose {{when the}} star was first awarded. It has {{received}} mixed reviews from food critics both while {{in its current}} incarnation, and while it was run by head chef Marcus Wareing. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the dishes were sometimes overcomplicated, and designed primarily to gain Michelin stars. The restaurant was named after the French wine Pétrus.|$|E
5|$|Despite the accident, a {{pre-production}} {{batch of}} ten aircraft was ordered on 27 July 1945 as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> mixed-power aircraft {{would be of}} some use easing the transition of pilots from piston-engine fighters to jet-engined ones. At the same time Sukhoi's Su-5 was cancelled as it was judged inferior to the I-250.|$|E
5|$|In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway {{was taken}} into public {{ownership}} and became the Metropolitan line of London Transport. The management of London Transport aimed to reduce goods services, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> there was little chance of the more distant parts of the former Metropolitan Railway ever becoming viable passenger routes. The line was closed on 30 November 1935, and all buildings and infrastructure at Brill associated with the line were sold at auction. Most of the infrastructure was subsequently demolished, though three station cottages survive.|$|E

5|$|Military bases {{repeatedly}} {{tried to}} call the Army Control Station in Hiroshima. The complete silence from that city puzzled the General Staff; they knew that no large enemy raid had occurred and that no sizable store of explosives was in Hiroshima at that time. A young officer was instructed to fly immediately to Hiroshima, to land, survey the damage, and return to Tokyo with reliable information for the staff. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> nothing serious had taken place and that the explosion was just a rumor.|$|E
5|$|The Court reargued {{the case}} {{at the behest of}} Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter, who used reargument as a {{stalling}} tactic, to allow the Court to gather a consensus around a Brown opinion that would outlaw segregation. The justices in support of desegregation spent much effort convincing those who initially intended to dissent to join a unanimous opinion. Although the legal effect would be same for a majority rather than unanimous decision, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> dissent could be used by segregation supporters as a legitimizing counter-argument.|$|E
5|$|The {{match is}} largely remembered for the {{disaster}} that occurred before the kick-off. Liverpool fans breached a fence separating {{the two groups}} of supporters and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 people and injuring hundreds. Despite calls for an abandonment, the match went ahead because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> further trouble would otherwise occur. The disaster prompted UEFA to ban English clubs from European football for five years.|$|E

5|$|Arbroath was the {{location}} of the Battle of Arbroath in 1446. A series of disagreements between the Chief Justiciary of Arbroath, Alexander Lindsay, third Earl of Crawford and Bishop James Kennedy of St Andrews resulted in Lindsay sacking the bishop's lands and burning his properties. Lindsay was excommunicated for his troubles and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> this was incompatible with his role as Chief Justiciary. The monks of Arbroath Abbey selected Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity as his replacement and the insult led to pitched battle in the town, leaving 500 dead, including Lindsay and Ogilvy. Large parts of the town were destroyed in the aftermath by the Lindsay family.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the mid-3rd {{century the}} {{emperors}} began to favor {{members of the}} equestrian order over senators, who had had a monopoly {{on the most important}} offices of state. Senators were stripped of the command of legions and most provincial governorships (as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> they lacked the specialized military upbringing needed in an age of acute defense needs), such posts being given to equestrians by Diocletian and his colleagues—following a practice enforced piecemeal by their predecessors. The emperors, however, still needed the talents and the help of the very rich, who were relied on to maintain social order and cohesion by means of a web of powerful influence and contacts at all levels. Exclusion of the old senatorial aristocracy threatened this arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Harmon was {{preceded by}} his two older brothers, Kenneth B. Harmon, {{of the class of}} 1910, and Millard F. Harmon, Jr., of the class of 1912. Hubert Harmon was ejected when it was {{discovered}} that he had two brothers at West Point, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the taxpayers would not be getting their money's worth educating three sons of the same family. He was readmitted in June 1911 after his father lobbied numerous government officials. He now only had one brother at West Point, as Kenneth had graduated the year before. Both Millard Jr., and Hubert subsequently became three-star generals.|$|E

5|$|The West Pier was {{constructed}} during {{a boom in}} pleasure pier building in the 1860s, during which 22 new piers were erected across Britain. It was designed by architect Eugenius Birch as a place for seaside visitors to enjoy fresh sea air. Some wealthy residents in the nearby Regency Square objected to construction, complaining that the planned toll houses at the entrance would spoil {{the view of the}} sea from their homes. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the pier would {{have a positive effect on}} property values in the town, so the pier was approved. Construction began in 1863 and the pier opened to the public on 6 October 1866.|$|E
5|$|When {{this was}} {{effected}} in 1090, John {{became the first}} Bishop of Bath, and St Peter's was raised to cathedral status. As the roles of bishop and abbot had been combined, the monastery became a priory, run by its prior. With the elevation of the abbey to cathedral status, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> a larger, more up-to-date building was required. John of Tours planned a new cathedral on a grand scale, dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul, but only the ambulatory was complete {{when he died in}} December 1122. He was buried in the cathedral. The most renowned scholar monk based in the abbey was Adelard of Bath; after his various travels he was back in the monastery by 1106.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Gandhi {{decided to}} promote Manekshaw to the rank of field marshal and {{subsequently}} appoint him as the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). However, after several objections from the bureaucracy, and the commanders of the navy and the air force, the appointment was dropped. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that,</b> as Manekshaw was from the army, as comparatively smaller forces the navy and air force would be neglected. Moreover, bureaucrats felt that it might challenge their influence over defence issues. Though Manekshaw was to retire in June 1972, his term was extended by a period of six months. On 3 January 1973, Manekshaw was conferred with the rank of field marshal at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He was the first Indian army officer to be promoted to the rank.|$|E

5|$|During 1941, the Middle East Commandos and Layforce were tasked {{to carry}} out a {{campaign}} of harassment and dislocation against enemy forces in the Mediterranean. At the time that Layforce was raised, the British had the ascendency in the theatre, as they had largely defeated the Italians. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the Commandos could be employed in the capture of the island of Rhodes. However, the arrival of the Afrika Korps in Cyrenaica and the invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece greatly changed the strategic outlook. By the time Layforce arrived in Egypt in March the situation had become dire. The deployment of forces to Greece meant that the Commandos became the only troops in general reserve. As the strategic situation worsened, it became increasingly difficult to employ them in the manner intended, as they were called upon as reinforcements {{to the rest of the}} army.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in modern}} democracies, Freemasonry is {{sometimes}} viewed with distrust. In the UK, Masons {{working in the}} justice system, such as judges and police officers, were from 1999 to 2009 required to disclose their membership. While a parliamentary inquiry found {{that there has been}} no evidence of wrongdoing, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> any potential loyalties Masons might have, based on their vows to support fellow Masons, should be transparent to the public. The policy of requiring a declaration of masonic membership of applicants for judicial office (judges and magistrates) was ended in 2009 by Justice Secretary Jack Straw (who had initiated the requirement in the 1990s). Straw stated that the rule was considered disproportionate, since no impropriety or malpractice had been shown as a result of judges being Freemasons.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{entry into}} the war in late 1941 stopped plans for the {{deployment}} of Australian armour to the Middle East. By the beginning of 1943 the Australian Armoured Corps was at its peak with 1,460 tanks on strength, {{the majority of them}} Matildas and light and medium M3s. Meanwhile, 65 production AC1 vehicles and one AC3 had been completed by June 1943. That year, the 3rd Army Tank Battalion was equipped with a squadron of AC1 tanks, which were modified to resemble German tanks and used in the filming of the movie, The Rats of Tobruk. This appears to have been the only time a squadron of Sentinels was used for any purpose. Nevertheless, the completed Sentinel tanks were used for evaluation purposes only and were not issued to operational armoured units, as the Australian Cruiser tank program was terminated in July 1943. By this time the Japanese threat had lessened, and US and British-made M3 Grant and Matilda tanks were being supplied to Australia from the Middle East, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Australia's manufacturing resources would be better spent on railway locomotive production.|$|E

5|$|John Rennie {{surveyed}} {{the line for}} a ship canal {{from the mouth of}} the River Parrett to Seaton in 1810, which was designed for ships of , but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the economic situation would not support the projected expenditure of over £1million. He then considered a more modest proposal, based on the original Bristol and Western plans, and the scheme, now renamed the Bristol and Taunton Canal, was authorised by an Act of Parliament dated 14 May 1811. The company had powers to raise £420,000 in shares and an additional £150,000 if required, but economic concerns meant that the project did not start immediately. Powers for the Bristol to Bridgwater section lapsed in 1815, but work finally commenced in 1822, to be halted by an injunction because the authorised route was not being followed. A further Act, of 17 June 1824, authorised the revised route, and changed the name of the project to the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal Company. The predicted costs for the construction of the shorter canal were £34,145, as opposed to £429,990 for the longer scheme.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{entered the}} 1984–85 European Cup as champions, {{and once again}} progressed to the final, where their opponents were Juventus of Italy. They aimed to win their fifth European Cup and keep the trophy. The 1985 European Cup Final {{was held at the}} Heysel Stadium in Brussels. The choice of venue had been criticised due to the {{dilapidated}} state of the stadium, and the club tried to persuade UEFA to change the venue. Before the kick-off, Liverpool fans breached a fence separating the two groups of supporters and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 people and injuring hundreds more.

5|$|The inquiry {{was run by}} Sir Louis Blom-Cooper; Bird was {{formally}} fired as a Cabinet minister on 10 May, the day Blom-Cooper arrived on Antigua. Blom-Cooper began work on 4 June, with Bird retaining a team of six lawyers for his defence; the inquiry, concluded in November, recommended banning Bird from holding public office {{for the rest of}} his life. The report was acted on and Bird was banned from becoming a minister again, although he retained his seat in the House. The report did not, however, recommend that Bird be forced to resign from the House or prosecuted criminally; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the public ridicule the guilty parties had been subjected to was punishment enough. Bird was later re-hired by the government, not as a Minister but as a special advisor to the Prime Minister on the subject of Public Utilities. After the Prime Minister finally retired and Lester became Antigua and Barbuda's leader on 5 September 1995, Bird was made Chairman of the ALP.|$|E
