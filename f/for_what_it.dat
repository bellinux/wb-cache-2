5|$|Neanderthals {{are known}} to have lived in caves around the Rock of Gibraltar; in 1848 the first known adult Neanderthal skull, and only the second Neanderthal fossil ever found, was {{excavated}} at Forbes' Quarry on the north face of the Rock. Had the skull been recognised <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was, the species might have been named Gibraltarians rather than Neanderthals. The date of the skull is unclear but it has been attributed to around the start of the last glacial period about 50,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Procter was the {{favourite}} poet of Queen Victoria. Her poetry {{went through}} numerous editions in the 19th century; Coventry Patmore called {{her the most}} popular poet of the day, after Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Her poems were set to music and made into hymns, and {{were published in the}} United States and Germany as well as in England. Nonetheless, by the early 20th century her reputation had diminished, and few modern critics have given her work attention. Those who have, however, argue that Procter's work is significant, in part <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> reveals about how Victorian women expressed otherwise repressed feelings.|$|E
5|$|In 1847, in {{response}} to perceived discrimination against First Nations people by the Hudson's Bay Company in the fur trade, Belcourt prepared a petition to Queen Victoria to seek redress. The petition was signed by 977 First Nations people, but the Colonial Secretary, Earl Grey, consulted with advisors who had little sympathy for the natives and took no action in the case. The Company criticised Belcourt <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> saw as his inciting discontent among the local First Nations. The Company administrators decided that the priest {{should not be allowed}} to remain in British North America. The missionary was arrested, but was released after the charges against him were discovered to be unfounded. At the urging of the Company's Governor, the Archbishop of Quebec asked Belcourt to return to Montreal. Belcourt asked the Governor of the Company to retract the charges for which he was arrested. The Governor apologised for what he described as a mistake on the part of the Company's chief Factors.|$|E

25|$|Michael Benthall's 1948 Shakespeare Memorial Theater production, {{starring}} Diana Wynyard and Anthony Quayle. This {{production is}} {{as well known}} <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> did not achieve as what it did. Benthall originally wanted to do an all-male version of the play, with Robert Helpmann playing Katherina. The theatre governors were so unimpressed with the idea, they fired Barry Jackson from his position as artistic director for not dismissing Benthall's idea out of hand immediately.|$|E

25|$|For Marx and Engels, then, {{the ruling}} classes control the {{subordinate}} classes through {{domination of the}} ideas available in the culture. In this way the subordinate classes {{are said to be}} mediated by the effects of ideology, or “false consciousness” or a belief system that doesn’t allow them to see the oppression they are enduring <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is. The problem with this idea, as many Marxists have noted, is that it doesn’t leave room for members of the subordinate classes to act on the world around them through alternate forms of mediation.|$|E

25|$|By contrast, {{according}} to one of Cronin's biographers, Alan Davies, the book's reception was mixed. A few of the more vociferous medical practitioners of the day took exception to one of its many messages: that a few well-heeled doctors in fashionable practices were ripping off their equally well-off patients. Some pointed to the lack of balance between criticism and praise for hard-working doctors. The majority accepted it <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was, a topical novel. The press attempted to incite passions within the profession in an attempt to sell copy, while Victor Gollancz followed suit in an attempt to promote the book, all overlooking {{the fact that it was}} a work of fiction, not a scientific piece of research, and not autobiographical.|$|E

25|$|They {{first began}} teaming {{together}} in June 2009 {{but did not}} become a proper team {{until the end of}} the year. The two were portrayed as narcissistic and vain bullies, constantly espousing their own perfection while ganging up on others and attacking their looks. They were a successful team, having won both women's titles available in WWE, the WWE Women's Championship, which they retired when they unified it with the WWE Divas Championship; both titles they claimed to hold as a tag team though this is not officially recognized. The group did court some controversy, however, receiving criticism from the Wrestling Observer Newsletter <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> considered the most disgusting promotional tactic regarding a storyline in which they bullied Mickie James for her supposed weight issues.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} no plans to build motorway-standard flank of the ring road at {{national}} government level, Glasgow City Council have recently published new plans <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> calls the Glasgow East End Regeneration Route (EERR). This would appear not to be a motorway, but instead an urban corridor which will connect the M74 extension at Polmadie with the M8/M80 at Provan. While the Council has openly voiced its commitment to the plan, it will likely face considerable controversy since its path will dissect the suburbs of Bridgeton, Carntyne and Parkhead making use of derelict land and an abandoned railway embankment. As of summer 2013, phases 1 and 2 of the project from the M74 to Parkhead have been completed. Phase 3 from Parkhead Forge to the M80 at Provan is scheduled for completion in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Allegorically, the Inferno {{represents}} the Christian soul seeing sin <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> really is, {{and the three}} beasts represent three types of sin: the self-indulgent, the violent, and the malicious. These three types of sin also provide the three main divisions of Dante's Hell: Upper Hell, outside the city of Dis, for the four sins of indulgence (lust, gluttony, avarice, anger); Circle 7 {{for the sins of}} violence; and Circles 8 and 9 for the sins of malice (fraud and treachery). Added to these are two unlike categories that are specifically spiritual: Limbo, in Circle 1, contains the virtuous pagans who were not sinful but were ignorant of Christ, and Circle 6 contains the heretics who contradicted the doctrine and confused the spirit of Christ. The circles number 9, with the addition of Satan completing the structure of 9 + 1 = 10.|$|E

500|$|Garfield {{took up the}} {{practice}} of law in 1865 as a means to improve his personal finances. His efforts took him to Wall Street where, the day after Lincoln's assassination, a riotous crowd led him into an impromptu speech to calm it: [...] "Fellow citizens! Clouds and darkness are round about Him! His pavilion is dark waters and thick clouds of the skies! Justice and judgment are the establishment of His throne! Mercy and truth shall go before His face! Fellow citizens! God reigns, and the Government at Washington still lives!" [...] The speech, with no mention or praise of Lincoln, was according to Garfield biographer Robert G. Caldwell [...] "...quite as significant <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> did not contain as <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> did." [...] In the following years, Garfield had more praise for Lincoln; a year after the Illinoisan's death Garfield stated that, [...] "Greatest among all these developments were the character and fame of Abraham Lincoln," [...] and in 1878 called Lincoln [...] "...one of the few great rulers whose wisdom increased with his power." ...|$|E
