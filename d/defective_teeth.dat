60|$|In surgery, {{having the}} least experience, and {{it being a}} {{business}} that spoke directly to the senses, he was most apt to distrust his own powers; but he had applied oils to several burns, cut round the roots of sundry <b>defective</b> <b>teeth,</b> and sewed up the wounds of numberless wood choppers, with considerable éclat, when an unfortunate jobber suffered a fracture of his leg by the tree {{that he had been}} felling. It was on this occasion that our hero encountered the greatest trial his nerves and moral feeling had ever sustained. In the hour of need, however, he was not found wanting. Most of the amputations in the new settlements, and they were quite frequent, were per formed by some one practitioner who, possessing originally a reputation, was enabled by this circumstance to acquire an experience that rendered him deserving of it; and Elnathan had been present at one or two of these operations. But on the present occasion the man of practice was not to be obtained, and the duty fell, as a matter of course, to the share of Mr. Todd. He went to work with a kind of blind desperation, observing, at the same time, all the externals of decent gravity and great skill, The sufferer’s name was Milligan, and it was to this event that Richard alluded, when he spoke of assisting the doctor at an amputation by holding the leg! The limb was certainly cut off, and the patient survived the operation. It was, however, two years before poor Milligan ceased to complain that they had buried the leg in so narrow a box that it was straitened for room; he could feel the pain shooting up from the inhumed fragment into the living members. Marmaduke suggested that the fault might lie in the arteries and nerves; but Richard, considering the amputation as part of his own handiwork, strongly repelled the insinuation, at the same time declaring that he had often heard of men who could tell when it was about to rain, by the toes of amputated limbs, After two or three years, notwithstanding, Milligan's complaints gradually diminished, the leg was dug up, and a larger box furnished, and from that hour no one had heard the sufferer utter another complaint on the subject. This gave the public great confidence in Dr. Todd, whose reputation was hourly increasing, and, luckily for his patients, his information also.|$|E

50|$|Barodontalgia is {{a symptom}} of dental disease, for example {{inflammatory}} cyst in the mandible.Indeed, most of the common oral pathologies have been reported as possible sources of barodontalgia: dental caries, <b>defective</b> <b>tooth</b> restoration, pulpitis, pulp necrosis, apical periodontitis, periodontal pockets, impacted teeth, and mucous retention cysts. One exception is barodontalgia manifested as referred pain from barosinusitis or barotitis-media. The latter two conditions are generated from pressure changes rather than pressure-related flare-up of pre-existing conditions.A meta-analysis of studies conducted between 2001 and 2010 revealed a rate of 5 episodes/1,000 flight-years. Maxillary and mandibular dentitions were affected equally in flight, but in diving, maxillary dentition was affected more than the mandibular dentition, which can indicate a greater role for maxillary sinus pathology in diving barodontalgia. Surprisingly, despite cabin pressurization, the current in-flight barodontalgia incidence is similar to the incidence {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. Also, despite the greater fluctuation in divers' pressures, the weighted incidence of barodontalgia among aircrews is similar to the weighted incidence among divers. Furthermore, contrary to common belief, and in contrast to diving conditions, the role of facial barotrauma in the cause of in-flight barodontalgia is only minor (about one-tenth of cases).|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe BMP {{signaling}} plays {{a pivotal}} {{role in the development of}} craniofacial organs, including the tooth and palate. BmprIa and BmprIb encode two type I BMP receptors that are primarily responsible for BMP signaling transduction. We investigated mesenchymal tissue-specific requirement of BmprIa and its functional redundancy with BmprIb during the development of mouse tooth and palate. BmprIa and BmprIb exhibit partially overlapping and distinct expression patterns in the developing tooth and palatal shelf. Neural crest-specific inactivation of BmprIa leads to formation of an unusual type of anterior clefting of the secondary palate, an arrest of tooth development at the bud/early cap stages, and severe hypoplasia of the mandible. <b>Defective</b> <b>tooth</b> and palate development is accompanied by the down-regulation of BMP-responsive genes and reduced cell proliferation levels in the palatal and dental mesenchyme. To determine if BmprIb could substitute for BmprIa during tooth and palate development, we expressed a constitutively active form of BmprIb (caBmprIb) in the neural crest cells in which BmprIa was simultaneously inactivated. We found that substitution of BmprIa by caBmprIb in neural rest cells rescues the development of molars and maxillary incisor, but the rescued teeth exhibit a delayed odontoblast and ameloblast differentiation. In contrast, caBmprIb fails to rescue the palatal and mandibular defects including the lack of lower incisors. Our results demonstrate an essential role for BmprIa in the mesenchymal component and a limited functional redundancy between BmprIa and BmprIb in a tissue-specific manner during tooth and palate development...|$|R

40|$|Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a {{group of}} {{inherited}} disorders with <b>defective</b> <b>tooth</b> enamel formation caused by various gene mutations. One of the mutations substitutes a cytidine to adenine in exon 6 of the X-chromosomal amelogenin gene, which results in a proline to threonine change in the expressed amelogenin. This transformation is four amino acids N terminal to the proteinase cleavage site in amelogenin for enamel matrix metalloproteinase- 20 (MMP- 20), also known as enamelysin. MMP- 20 effects the release of tyrosine rich amelogenin peptide (TRAP) from amelogenin. This study evaluated the rate MMP- 20 hydrolyzes the putative mutated amelogenin cleavage site. The proteolytic site was modeled as a substrate by two synthetic peptides, P 1 (SYGYEPMGGWLHHQ) and M 1 (SYGYETMGGWLHHQ), selected from residue 36 - 49 of the amino acid sequence for amelogenin and the respective X-linked amelogenin mutant. Recombinant metalloproteinase- 20 (rMMP- 20) was used to digest the oligopeptides and the truncated peptides were separated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by mass spectrometry. The results demonstrate that both peptides are cleaved between tryptophan and leucine, matching the TRAP cutting site found in tooth enamel. However, the apparent first order rate of digestion of the mutation containing peptide by rMMP- 20 was approximately 25 times slower than that of the non-mutated peptide. This study suggests that the reduced rate of TRAP formation due to a single amino acid substitution may alter enamel formation and consequently result in amelogenesis imperfecta.

Purpose: This research aimed to determine macrophage, PMN and lymphocyte cells of animal models treated with a combination of 12 % spirulina and 20 % chitosan on the 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd post-extraction day. Methods: Animal models were randomly divided into control (K) and treatment (P) groups. Each group was further divided into three subgroups (KI, KII, KIII and PI, PII, PIII). The post-extraction sockets of the control group animals were then filled with CMC Na 3 %.

40|$|År 2002 drabbades omkring 275 000 individer runt om i världen av cancer i munhålan. Mer än hälften av dessa {{kommer att}} dö av sin sjukdom inom 5 år. Förekomsten av cancer i munhåla och svalg (Oral and Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma, OOSCC) varierar i olika delar av världen. Det är en ovanlig lokalisation av cancer i Sverige, men antalet nya fall ökar. I Sverige svarar sjukdomen för omkring 1 % av all cancer, vilket är lågt jämfört med förekomsten i Indien och andra delar av Asien där den är en av de vanligaste formerna av cancer. Studien omfattar 132 konsekutiva patienter i Södra sjukvårdsregionen som under perioden {{september}} 2000 - januari 2004 fått primärdiagnosen OOSCC. De inkluderade patienterna motsvarar 80 % av samtliga fall. Ur befolkningsregistret identifierades 396 ålders-, köns-, och länsmatchade cancerfria kontrollpersoner av vilka 320 (81 %) samtyckte till att medverka. Fall och kontroller genomgick en standardiserad intervju, identisk undersökning av munhåla inklusive panoramaröntgen samt uppsamling av celler från munhålan för bestämning av humant papillomvirus (HPV). En journal speciellt designad för studien användes. Syftet med studien var att utvärdera potentiella riskfaktorer för OOSCC - munhygien, tandstatus, munslemhinneförändringar, alkohol, tobak, virus och vissa livsstilsfaktorer - och att analysera i vilken grad de var för sig eller tillsammans ökar risken för OOSCC. Ett ytterligare syfte var att bedöma om dessa faktorer påverkar frekvensen av recidiv. Statistiska analyser visade att medelmåttig och dålig munhygien ökar risken för OOSCC. Fler än 20 förlorade tänder och/eller dåligt fungerande/defekta helproteser utgör också en ökad risk. Regelbundna tandläkarbesök är däremot förenat med minskad risk för OOSCC. In the year 2002, about 275, 000 inhabitants {{around the world}} developed oral cancer and over half of them will die of their disease within 5 years. Oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OOSCC) accounts for about 1 % of all cancers in Sweden – which is low compared to the incidence on the Indian subcontinent and {{in other parts of}} Asia, where {{it is one of the}} most common forms of cancer. The incidence in Sweden is increasing, however. The study comprised 80 % (132 / 165) of all consecutive cases living in the Southern Healthcare Region, born in Sweden and without previous cancer diagnosis (except skin cancer), who were diagnosed with OOSCC during the period September 2000 to January 2004. Using the Swedish Population Register, 396 cancer-free controls were identified and matched by age, gender and county. Of these individuals, 320 (81 %) agreed to take part in the study. Cases and controls were subjected to a standardised interview, identical oral examinations including panoramic radiographs, and cell sampling for human papillomavirus (HPV) analysis. In total 128 patients with planned curative treatment were followed for a median time of 22 months (range 0 – 36). The aims were to assess different potential risk factors in OOSCC such as oral hygiene, dental status, oral mucosal lesions, alcohol and tobacco use, virus infection, and some related to lifestyle. A further aim was to assess the influence of these factors on recurrence or occurrence of a new second primary tumour (SPT) of squamous cell carcinoma. In multivariate analysis average oral hygiene (OR 2. 0; 95 % CI 1. 1 – 3. 6) and poor oral hygiene (OR 5. 3; 95 % CI 2. 5 – 11. 3), more than 5 <b>defective</b> <b>teeth</b> (OR 3. 1; 95 % CI 1. 2 – 8. 2) and more than 20 teeth missing (OR 3. 4; 95 % CI 1. 4 - 8. 5), as well as defective or malfunctioning complete dentures (OR 3. 8; 95 % CI 1. 3 – 11. 4) were identified as significant risk factors for development of OOSCC. Regular dental care reduced the risk of OOSCC (OR 0. 4; 95 % CI 0. 2 – 0. 6). The cases reported a higher consumption of alcohol than the controls. More than 350 g of alcohol per week (OR 2. 6; 95 % CI 1. 3 – 5. 4) and 11 – 20 cigarettes per day (OR 2. 4; 95 % CI 1. 3 - 4. 1) were dose-dependent risk factors. The results showed a tendency for women to have a greater risk (OR 1. 8) than men at any given level of tobacco consumption. There was no increased risk of OOSCC among users of Swedish moist snuff. There was a significant relationship between high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and OOSCC (OR 63; 95 % CI 14 – 280). Forty-seven of the cases (36 %) were high-risk HPV infected and 7 (5. 3 %) were low-risk HPV infected in the specimens collected from the oral cavity. The corresponding figures for the controls were 3 (0. 94 %) and 13 (4. 1 %), respectively. The high-risk HPV types found in the oral cavity were the same types as observed in cervical cancer. Tumour stage was associated with both higher relative rate (RR) of recurrence or second primary tumour (SPT) of squamous cell carcinoma, and death in intercurrent diseases (DICD), defined as death before the occurrence of recurrence or SPT. High-risk HPV infected patients had an almost threefold increased RR of recurrence/SPT, but seemingly a lower RR of DICD compared to high-risk negative cases. Patients with tonsillar carcinoma had a significantly higher cause-specific RR of recurrence/SPT (RR 2. 06; CI 0. 99 - 4. 28) compared to patients with OSCC of other sites. High alcohol consumption was associated with a high RR of recurrence/SPT, but not with DICD. There was no increased RR of recurrence/SPT related to smoking, but an association between smoking and DICD. In conclusion, the results in this study confirm that both smoking tobacco and alcohol consumption are risk factors for OOSCC. The use of Swedish moist snuff had no effect on the risk. Independent risk factors identified are poor oral hygiene, inadequate dental status and malfunctioning complete dentures. Regular dental check-ups are a preventive factor. Among other possible risk factors studied, high-risk HPV infection appears to be the strongest. Highrisk HPV infection increases the cause-specific RR of recurrence or SPT. Tumour stage influences the rate of recurrence/SPT...|$|E

Though these results do not define the basic defect unambiguously, they provide the first report of a disorder being due to an abnormality in small proteoglycan biosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|Perinatal lethal hypophosphatasia {{is a rare}} {{inherited}} disorder {{characterized by}} due to <b>defective</b> bone and <b>teeth</b> mineralization deficiency of alkaline phosphatase activity. Intrauterine bone mineralization is markedly reduced in affected fetuses. The patient, who presented with soft skull with no impression of bone showed widened sutures, short and bowed tibia in addition to shorter proximal length when compared to distal parts in all extremities. Radiographic evaluation revealed poor bone mineralization. The severe clinical progress in addition to low alkaline phosphatase level (3 IU/L, N: 185 - 350 IU/L) supported the diagnosis of perinatal lethal hypophosphatasia in this patient. We herein present a perinatal lethal hypophosphatasia newborn without prenatal diagnosis and aim to discuss this rare disorder in a newborn with skelatal deformity.

40|$|Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is {{a genetically}} {{heterogeneous}} group of diseases {{that result in}} <b>defective</b> development of <b>tooth</b> enamel. Mutations in several enamel proteins and proteinases {{have been associated with}} AI. The object {{of this study was to}} evaluate evidence of etiology for the six major candidate gene loci in two Brazilian families with AI. Genomic DNA was obtained from family members and all exons and exon-intron boundaries of the ENAM, AMBN, AMELX, MMP 20, KLK 4 and Amelotin gene were amplified and sequenced. Each family was also evaluated for linkage to chromosome regions known to contain genes important in enamel development. The present study indicates that the AI in these two families is not caused by any of the known loci for AI or any of the major candidate genes proposed in the literature. These findings indicate extensive genetic heterogeneity for non-syndromic AI...|$|R
40|$|Dentin {{hypersensitivity}} is {{a common}} problem found in both male and female, mainly of older age. Discomfort or pain perceived in dentin hypersensitivity is caused by crown surface area that is not protected by enamel or dental root that is not protected by cementum. Characteristic of dentin hypersensitivity is acute, brief but sharp pain in dentin that is not covered by enamel. Pain can also be caused by edge leak on a <b>defective</b> restoration, fractured <b>teeth,</b> and disorder. Therefore, a thorough examination is {{required in order to}} apply the appropriate treatment. Various action and material can be used to treat this condition, however the principle idea is to organize intradental nervous activity or seal off dentinal tubule. On a case of dentin hypersensitivity due to cavity lesion either caused by caries or non caries, restoration has to be done. Condition without cavity can be treated with desenzitising agent such as sodium fluoride solution applied using particular device, fluoride toothpaste, calcium phosphate sillicate.

40|$|Abstract Background Hypohidrotic {{ectodermal}} dysplasia (HED) is a genetic disorder characterized by <b>defective</b> development of <b>teeth,</b> hair, nails and eccrine sweat glands. Both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of HED have previously {{been linked to}} mutations in the ectodysplasin 1 anhidrotic receptor (EDAR) protein that {{plays an important role}} during embryogenesis. Methods The coding DNA sequence of the EDAR gene was analyzed in two large Swedish three-generational families with autosomal dominant HED. Results A non-sense C to T mutation in exon 12 was identified in both families. This disease-specific mutation changes an arginine amino acid in position 358 of the EDAR protein into a stop codon (p. Arg 358 X), thereby truncating the protein. In addition to the causative mutation two polymorphisms, not associated with the HED disorder, were also found in the EDAR gene. Conclusion The finding of the p. Arg 358 X mutation in the Swedish families is the first corroboration of a previously described observation in an American family. Thus, our study strengthens the role of this particular mutation in the aetiology of autosomal dominant HED and confirms the importance of EDAR for the development of HED. </p...|$|R
40|$|The amelogenesis imperfectas (AI) are {{a genetically}} {{heterogeneous}} group of diseases {{that result in}} <b>defective</b> development of <b>tooth</b> enamel. Although X-linked, autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of AI have been clinically characterized, only two genes (AMELX and ENAM) {{have been associated with}} AI. To date, three enamelin (ENAM) mutations have been identified. These mutations cause phenotypically diverse forms of autosomal dominant AI. Detailed phenotype-genotype correlations have not been performed for autosomal dominant AI due to ENAM mutations. We identified a previously unreported kindred segregating for the ENAM mutation, g. 8344 delG. Light and electron microscopy analyses of unerupted permanent teeth show the enamel is markedly reduced in thickness, lacks a prismatic structure and has a laminated appearance. Taken together these histological features support the enamelin protein as being critical {{for the development of a}} normal enamel thickness and that it likely has a role in regulating c-axis crystallite growth. Because there is growing molecular and phenotypic diversity in the enamelin defects, it is critical to have a nomenclature and numbering system for characterizing these conditions. We present a standardized nomenclature for ENAM mutations that will allow consistent reporting and communication...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: Bruxism {{has been}} defined as a diurnal or nocturnal parafunctional habit. Etiology of bruxism has {{remained}} controversial and some investigators believe that psychological factors may {{play a major role in}} promoting and perpetuating this habit. The aim of this case-control study was to assess the existence of an association between bruxism and psychosocial disorders in adolescents., Participants were chosen among 114, 12 - 14 year old students (girls). They were divided into two groups, bruxers and nonbruxers, on the basis of both validated clinical criteria and interview with each patient. A few participants were excluded on the basis of presence of systemic disorders, TMJ disorders, other oral habits, primary <b>teeth,</b> <b>defective</b> restorations and premature contacts. Following matching of two groups in regard to parent&#x 2032;s age and education, mother&#x 2032;s marital status, child support status, mother&#x 2032;s employment status, and socio-economical status, 25 cases and 25 controls were enlisted. A self report validated questionnaire (YSR, 11 - 18 yr) was then filled out by both groups for the evaluation of 12 psychosocial symptoms. Results: Remarkable differences in certain psychosocial aspects were found between the two groups. Prevalence of psychosocial disorders including Thought Disorders (P < 0. 005), Conduct Disorders (P < 0. 05), Antisocial Disorders (P < 0. 06) as identified by YSR was significantly higher in bruxers. Significant differences between the two groups also emerged in total YSR scores (P < 0. 005). The results of Odds Ratio revealed that a bruxer adolescent has 16 times greater probability for psychosocial disorders than a non-bruxer one. Fischer exact test and T-test were used and Odds Ratio and Confidence Interval was estimated. Conclusion: Support to the existence of an association between bruxism and psychosocial disorders has been provided...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Hypophosphatasia {{is a rare}} {{inherited}} disorder {{characterized by}} <b>defective</b> bone and <b>teeth</b> mineralization, and deficiency of serum and bone alkaline phosphatase activity. The prevalence of severe forms of the disease has been estimated at 1 / 100 000. The symptoms are highly variable in their clinical expression, which ranges from stillbirth without mineralized bone to early loss of teeth without bone symptoms. Depending on the age at diagnosis, six clinical forms are currently recognized: perinatal (lethal), perinatal benign, infantile, childhood, adult and odontohypophosphatasia. In the lethal perinatal form, the patients show markedly impaired mineralization in utero. In the prenatal benign form these symptoms are spontaneously improved. Clinical symptoms of the infantile form are respiratory complications, premature craniosynostosis, widespread demineralization and rachitic changes in the metaphyses. The childhood form is characterized by skeletal deformities, short stature, and waddling gait, and the adult form by stress fractures, thigh pain, chondrocalcinosis and marked osteoarthropathy. Odontohypophosphatasia is characterized by premature exfoliation of fully rooted primary teeth and/or severe dental caries, often not associated with abnormalities of the skeletal system. The disease is due to mutations in the liver/bone/kidney alkaline phosphatase gene (ALPL; OMIM# 171760) encoding the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP). The diagnosis is based on laboratory assays and DNA sequencing of the ALPL gene. Serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity is markedly reduced in hypophosphatasia, while urinary phosphoethanolamine (PEA) is increased. By using sequencing, approximately 95 % of mutations are detected in severe (perinatal and infantile) hypophosphatasia. Genetic counseling of the disease {{is complicated by the}} variable inheritance pattern (autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive), the existence of the uncommon prenatal benign form, and by incomplete penetrance of the trait. Prenatal assessment of severe hypophosphatasia by mutation analysis of chorionic villus DNA is possible. There is no curative treatment for hypophosphatasia, but symptomatic treatments such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or teriparatide {{have been shown to be}} of benefit. Enzyme replacement therapy will be certainly the most promising challenge of the next few years. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground: We used {{evolutionary}} {{analysis of}} alkaline phosphatase (tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase, TNSALP) to predict missense mutations leading to hypophosphatasia. Results: We found 469 sensitive positions and validated 99 % of the 204 known mutations. Conclusion: It {{is a more}} powerful method than in silico models to validate missense mutations in TNSALP. Significance: Such an approach should be widely used to support genetic diagnostics. ALPL encodes the tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP), which removes phosphate groups from various substrates. Its function is essential for bone and tooth mineralization. In humans, ALPL mutations lead to hypophosphatasia, a genetic disorder characterized by <b>defective</b> bone and/or <b>tooth</b> mineralization. To date, 275 ALPL mutations {{have been reported to}} cause hypophosphatasia, of which 204 were simple missense mutations. Molecular evolutionary analysis has proved to be an efficient method to highlight residues important for the protein function and to predict or validate sensitive positions for genetic disease. Here we analyzed 58 mammalian TNSALP to identify amino acids unchanged, or only substituted by residues sharing similar properties, through 220 millions years of mammalian evolution. We found 469 sensitive positions of the 524 residues of human TNSALP, which indicates a highly constrained protein. Any substitution occurring at one of these positions is predicted to lead to hypophosphatasia. We tested the 204 missense mutations resulting in hypophosphatasia against our predictive chart, and validated 99 % of them. Most sensitive positions were located in functionally important regions of TNSALP (active site, homodimeric interface, crown domain, calcium site, [...] .). However, some important positions are located in regions, the structure and/or biological function of which are still unknown. Our chart of sensitive positions in human TNSALP (i) enables to validate or invalidate at low cost any ALPL mutation, which would be suspected to be responsible for hypophosphatasia, by contrast with time consuming and expensive functional tests, and (ii) displays higher predictive power than in silico models of prediction...|$|R
