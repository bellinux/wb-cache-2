The basin began to form in the Pleistocene and contains more than 1000 m of sedimentary fill in the main <b>depocenter.</b> The eastern end of the basin is currently being deformed by transpression associated with the southwestern end of the Conway segment. The destruction of the basin at its eastern end is matched by transtensional deformation at the western end that continues to enlarge the basin, giving rise to a roughly steady-state geometry.

50|$|Deposition in the Gulf of Corinth {{occurred}} {{in at least}} two phases, separated by a widespread unconformity. Deposition before 400 ka marks the first phase, likely open to the east, was filled with continental and shallow-water deposits with subsidence rates slightly exceeding sedimentation rates. Average uplift rates during the late Quaternary are estimated between 1-1.5 mm/yr on the southern margin increasing during the Holocene at 1.3-2.2 mm/yr. The high uplift rates expose many marine terraces and other continental to marine deposits. Infilling of the basin began in the Pliocene, depositing continental and shallow-water lacustrine facies followed by marine sediments in the middle Pliocene. This phase can be called proto-Gulf of Corinth as it was a different size and fill than the present day basin and had two different 20-50 km wide <b>depocenters.</b> These <b>depocenters,</b> controlled by north and south dipping faults, crop out near the south margin on the Peloponnese inland.

30|$|The {{relationship}} between deposition and tectonics of sedimentary basins {{has been a}} significant subject in recent years. Using typical rift basins such as the Nanpu Sag as an example, combined with the analysis of the tectonics-palaeogeomorphology of basins, we undertook a detailed study of the differences of the third-order sequences in different basins, the combination of depositional systems within the sequence framework and the distribution of <b>depocenters</b> and subsidence centers. Our results revealed a significant {{relationship between}} the tectonics-palaeogeomorphology of rift basins and the filling styles of sedimentary sequences. The basin structure plays a primary role in controlling the development of the third-order sequences and the boundary of these sequences is easily formed in basins with gentle slopes, shallow water and a small area. The characteristics of the tectonics-palaeogeomorphology of rift basins are dominated by half-grabens of extensional faults, which affect the temporal and spatial combination of sedimentary systems within the sequences as well as the distribution of <b>depocenters</b> and subsidence centers. Based on the development rules of the faults dominating the half-grabens of extensional faults, rift basins are classified into two types: the single fault segmented-linkage type and the multi-fault combination type. The main controlling factors of the temporal and spatial combination of sedimentary systems and the distribution of <b>depocenters</b> and subsidence centers in different basins are different. The characteristics of early segmentation and later linkage of the faults {{play a critical role in}} controlling the sedimentary system combination within the sequence framework and the temporal and spatial differences of <b>depocenters</b> and subsidence centers of the single fault segmented-linkage rift basins, while the differences in fault activities are the dominating factors of the multi-fault combination rift basins.|$|R

[...] Large amounts of clastic sediment derived from the rising central mountains, and the now inverted Paleogene poured into the lower Kutai Basin. The proto-Mahakam river began to prograde eastward. Subsequent tectonic inversion events in the middle Miocene and Pliocene continued to shift the deltaic <b>depocenter</b> of the Mahakam river eastward into the Makassar Strait. Compression in the middle Miocene produced a coast parallel anticlinorum into which the Mahakam river incised as the folds were inverted. This incision has prevented any lateral migration of the lowermost Mahakam river, creating a point source deltaic <b>depocenter</b> that has been active since the mid Miocene.

The state of knowledge of the region indicates different crustal and tectonic features {{to the north and}} to the south of the fault zone. For this reason we analyzed the shallower and deeper tectonics imaged by the HR-MCS to compare deformation styles and amount of extension, and finally to define the tectonic role of the fault zone. HR-MCS lines show a common tectonic style characterized by listric normal-faults with roll-over anticlines and extensional <b>depocenters.</b> Locally to the south, these faults show a lateral-component of slip at the vicinity of the Adra Ridge dextral-normal fault. These listric faults affect the basement made up of thinned continental crust intruded by subduction-related magma up to the Tortonian–Quaternary sediments. HR-MCS profiles show two impulses of extension and associated <b>depocenters,</b> during the Tortonian–Messinian and the Plio–Quaternary. Nevertheless these common features, the sense of extension is SW-directed to the north and NE-directed to the south. Furthermore, the amount of extension is larger to the north, as inferred by the occurrence of large extension-related <b>depocenters</b> in contrast with minor <b>depocenters</b> to the south. The difference in amount of extension is larger for the Tortonian–Messinian extensional pulse than for the Plio–Quaternary one.

In the Late Cretaceous the tectonic regime of Rocas Verdes Basin changed leading to its transformation into a compressional foreland basin -the Magallanes Basin- in the Cenozoic. This change was associated with an eastward move of the basin <b>depocenter</b> and the obduction of ophiolites.

40|$|In {{extending}} areas undergoing regional tectonic uplift, {{the persistence}} of subsidence at a normal-fault hanging-wall depends on the competition between regional and local tectonic effects. When regional uplift exceeds the subsidence of the hanging-wall block, denudation prevails at both the hanging-wall and the foot-wall. When local tectonic subsidence exceeds regional uplift, sedimentation occurs over the hanging-wall block, supplied by foot-wall erosion. We analyzed a PlioceneeQuaternary continental basin, currently crossed by the Tiber River in Italy. The tectono-sedimentary evolution of the basin developed at the hanging-wall of a regional low-angle extensional detachment, the Alto Tiberina Fault, in the axial region of the Northern Apennines of Italy. This area is affected by regional uplift {{on the order of}} 0. 5 e 1. 0 mm/yr. The present-day activity of the fault is revealed by both microseismicity and geodetic (GPS) data. We investigated the mid- (10 e 100 ka) and long-term (0. 5 e 3. 0 Ma) evolution of the three <b>depocenters</b> by studying the continental Pleistocene succession infilling the basin as well as fluvial terraces and higher paleosurfaces carved into the Pleistocene deposits. By using surficial geologic data and an interpretation of a set of seismic reflection profiles, we show that the three <b>depocenters</b> experienced a fairly similar evolution during the PlioceneeEarly Pleistocene, when a 1000 -m-thick continental succession was deposited. On the contrary, geomorphological observations indicate that, {{at the beginning of the}} Middle Pleistocene, a switch occurred in the evolution of the three <b>depocenters.</b> In the northernmost Sansepolcro sub-basin, bounding normal faults are active and hanging-wall subsidence outpaces regional uplift. Concurrently, in the Umbertide and Ponte Pattoli subbasins uplift dominates over the hanging-wall subsidence, promoting river incision and exhumation of the Pleistocene deposits. For these two <b>depocenters,</b> by means of terrace-river correlations, we estimate that the incision rate is ~ 0. 3 e 0. 35 mm/yr, suggesting a maximum tectonic subsidence of 0. 2 mm/yr. The identification of a heterogeneous uplift pattern along the hanging-wall of the Alto Tiberina Fault, driven by different displacement rates of its fault splays, allowed us to characterize fault segments with different activities and, possibly, different seismic behaviors...|$|R

Also referred to as the Louann and the Yucatan Salt basins. Salt deposition in the Gulf of Mexico is poorly dated; the Louann Salt has no index fossils and the age is based on the ages of formations below and above. Salt deposition began in the Jurassic after the first rotation of the Yucatan Block. The thick halite was later split into two main sections as the seafloor spread, with some continued salt deposition as the rifting continued. The age of the salts are supported by the stratigraphy in the northern Gulf of Mexico where the Eagle Mills red beds, as discussed above, contain dikes as young as 180 Ma, and the Smackover formation above the salts contain index ammonite fossils placing the salts at an age no younger than 156 Ma. [...] Deformation of this nearly 4 kilometer halite formation would eventually be caused by differential pressure due to uneven and heavy sediment loading on top, by siliiciclastic, eolian, playa and other arid terrestrial environment sediments closer to shore [...] implying that at certain times during deposition, sediments accumulated almost entirely up to sea level.The salt structures, which include anticlines, pillows, plugs and walls, in addition to extensive sheets, were created long after deposition by the rapid overlying sedimentation.

40|$|The {{presently}} active Zaire (Congo) turbidite system {{reveals a}} well-organized Quaternary architecture, with <b>depocenters</b> that partly overlap {{each other in}} response to avulsion. Based on previous work, more than 76 channels are organized into three individual fans (Northern, Southern, and Axial Fan, from the oldest to the youngest). A statistical analysis of both longitudinal and lateral migration of <b>depocenters</b> was conducted. The longitudinal shifts were studied through the temporal evolution of the channel lengths and the distances to the bifurcation points from a common reference point arbitrarily positioned on the canyon course, up-dip from the most proximal bifurcation point. The number of bifurcation points on a channel was also calculated. These three architectural parameters show a cyclic organization through time, better expressed in the Axial Fan, with cycles of down-fan and up-fan movements reflecting prograding– retrograding cycles. Based on a previous study of the kaolinite/smectite (K/S) ratio in the hemipelagic drape covering the Southern Fan, i. e., contemporaneous with {{the building of the}} Axial Fan, the prograding peaks of the Axial cycles are correlated to peaks in K/S, which reflect phases of intense Zaire River water discharge, during warm and humid interglacial periods. These correlations suggest that both the channel lengths and the avulsion process are controlled by climate changes that appear as a major forcing factor throughout the Quaternary. The effects of climate control can be modified by the interplay of other internal and/or external factors.

We set up analogue models (thin basal plate model and thick basal plate model) to investigate the evolution of Yinggehai basin. From the experiments, we consider that the basin evolution was related to the extrusion and clockwise rotation of the Indochina block, which was caused by the collision of the Indian plate and Tibet. This process took place in four main stages: (1) Slow rifting stage (before 36 Ma) with a NW-trending depocenter; (2) rifting stage formed by sinistral slip of the Indochina block accompanied by rapid clockwise rotation between 36 and 21 Ma; (3) rifting-thermal subsidence stage affected by sinistral slip of the Indochina (21 - 5 Ma) block and (4) dextral strike-slip (5 - 0 Ma).
