5|$|Hematinic {{deficiencies}} (vitamin B12, {{folic acid}} and iron), occurring singly or in combination, and {{with or without}} any underlying gastrointestinal disease, may be twice as common in people with RAS. However, iron and vitamin supplements only infrequently improve the ulceration. The relationship to vitamin B12 <b>deficiency</b> {{has been the subject}} of many studies. Although these studies found that 0–42% of those with recurrent ulcers suffer from vitamin B12 <b>deficiency,</b> an association with <b>deficiency</b> is rare. Even in the absence of <b>deficiency,</b> vitamin B12 supplementation may be helpful due to unclear mechanisms. Hematinic deficiencies can cause anemia, which is also associated with aphthous-like ulceration.|$|E

Fewer registered nurse hours and nursing assistant hours were associated with total <b>deficiencies</b> and quality of care <b>deficiencies,</b> when other variables were controlled.

5|$|In {{areas where}} there is little iodine in the diet, {{typically}} remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, iodine <b>deficiency</b> gives rise to hypothyroidism, symptoms of which are extreme fatigue, goitre, mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures. Iodine <b>deficiency</b> {{is the leading cause}} of preventable intellectual disability, a result that occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered hypothyroidic by a lack of the element. The addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in the wealthier nations, but iodine <b>deficiency</b> remains a serious public health problem today in the developing world. Iodine <b>deficiency</b> is also a problem in certain areas of Europe.

40|$|<b>Deficiencies</b> {{encompassing}} part {{or all of}} the X heterochromatin of Drosophila melanogaster {{have been}} linked to three abnormalities in male meiosis and spermatogenesis: X-Y nondisjunction, skewed sperm recovery ratios favoring sperm with reduced chromatin content, and sterility in males carrying either a Y-autosome translocation or mal +Y. In this study, 18 X heterochromatic <b>deficiencies</b> of varying sizes were tested in XY males for their spermatogenic phenotypes. All 18 proved to be either mutant for all three phenotypes or wild type for all three. Although variable among mutant <b>deficiencies,</b> expression levels of all three phenotypes were strongly correlated. <b>Deficiencies</b> that cause high levels of nondisjunction also cause severe recovery ratio distortion and are completely sterile in conjunction with mal+ Y. Low nondisjunction <b>deficiencies</b> cause comparable mild effects for the other phenotypes. The same <b>deficiencies</b> were also tested in males carrying a large heterochromatic free X duplication Dp(1; f) 3. For all <b>deficiencies</b> which induce nondisjunction in XY males, the Y and free duplication pair regularly and the X fails to pair in XYDp males.
