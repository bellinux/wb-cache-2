40|$|Venom {{detection}} {{is crucial}} for confirmation of envenomation and snake type in snake-bite patients. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is used to <b>detect</b> venom, but antivenom in samples prevents venom detection.

Serum samples underwent dissociation treatment and then Russell’s viper venom or Australian elapid venom measured by EIA. In confirmed Russell’s viper bites with venom <b>detected</b> pre-antivenom (positive controls), no venom was <b>detected</b> in untreated post-antivenom samples, but was after dissociation treatment. In 104 non-envenomed patients (negative controls), no venom was <b>detected</b> after dissociation treatment.
