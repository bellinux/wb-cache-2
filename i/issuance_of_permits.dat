5|$|In early 2014, {{as part of}} an {{incentive}} to close unlicensed buildings in the regency, police posted notification that the Kampoeng Rawa site was unlicensed. The manager of Kampoeng Rawa, Agus Sumarno, stated that they had tried to gain permission for their buildings, but both the provincial and regional governments had stated that they were unable to issue it. When the police banner later disappeared, there were reports that the site's management had taken it down, although the management stated that it had fallen under a hard wind. The head of the Semarang Regency Council, Bambang Kusriyanto, stated that he had confirmed Kampoeng Rawa's management had applied for permission and called for the government to process the request expediently. In February 2015, President Joko Widodo called for the <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> <b>permits</b> to be expedited, citing the site's potential to promote social empowerment.|$|E
500|$|By 1971, Gravel was urging {{construction}} of the much-argued Trans-Alaska pipeline, addressing environmental concerns {{by saying that the}} pipeline's builders and operators should have [...] "total and absolute" [...] responsibility for any consequent environmental damage. Two years later, the debate over the pipeline came to a crux, with The New York Times describing it as [...] "environmentalists [...] a holy war with the major oil companies." [...] In February 1973 the U.S. Court of Appeals blocked the <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> <b>permits</b> for construction; Gravel and fellow Alaskan Senator Ted Stevens reacted by urging Congress to pass legislation overturning the court's decision. Environmentalists opposed to the pipeline, such as the Environmental Defense Fund and the Sierra Club then sought to use the recently passed National Environmental Policy Act to their advantage; Gravel designed an amendment to the pipeline bill that would immunize the pipeline from any further court challenges under that law, and thus speed its construction. Passage of the amendment became the key battle regarding the pipeline. On July 17, 1973, in a dramatic roll call vote, the Gravel amendment was approved as a 49–49 tie was broken in favor by Vice President Spiro Agnew. The actual bill enabling the pipeline then passed easily; Gravel had triumphed.|$|E
