40|$|Abstract. The {{samples of}} V-N microalloyed mild steel were {{obtained}} in <b>duo</b> <b>mill</b> with the normal deformation {{rate and the}} normal rolling temperature except final rolling temperature, which is at 780 °C, 730 °C and 680 °C respectively. The tensile test was carried out and the microstructure was observed with optical microscope. It {{was found that the}} mechanical properties improved dramatically compared with normal process, the final rolling temperature is more than 900 °C. The main reason is the fine grain size and second phase particles. With the final rolling temperature decreasing, the mechanical property further improves until the final rolling temperature of 700 °C...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the major topic were the bonding {{properties}} of the layer-clad aluminum sheets. The bonding was performed between AlMn 1 Si 0. 8 and AlSi 10 alloys using hot rolling (a VON ROLL experimental <b>duo</b> <b>mill).</b> The experimental temperatures were 460, 480 and 500 °C. The goodness of bonding was tested by tensile test and T-peel test. T-peel test provided a good description {{about the quality of}} bonding. Structure analysis was also performed by light microscopy to detect typical bonding faults. The aim of this investigation is modelling the bonding conformation in experimental conditions. Further aim of this investigation is to produce some typical bonding faults and find the cause of formation. The influence of the rolling temperature and surface roughness on the bonding was also analyzed. Rolling schedule and the role of first pass on the development of perfect bonding were experimentally determined...|$|E
40|$|The {{fracture}} {{behavior of}} CAD/CAM fabricated crowns was investigated {{as a function}} of material thickness for six silicate ceramic materials: Mark II, e. max CAD, Celtra <b>Duo</b> <b>milled,</b> Celtra <b>Duo</b> fired, Suprinity, Enamic. Crowns with thicknesses 0. 5 / 1. 0 / 1. 5 mm were fabricated with CEREC and adhesively seated to dies fabricated with stereolithography technology (n= 144). Thermomechanical loading and fractural loading was performed. Statistical analysis was done with one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Scheffé test. For 1. 5 mm, all crowns survived fatigue testing, for 1. 0 mm, survival was 100 % only for materials e. max CAD and Suprinity. For 0. 5 mm, best survival rate was 37. 5 % for Suprinity. Maximum fractural loading significantly varied among the groups. For 0. 5 mm, highest value was found for Suprinity (660. 1 N). Mark II showed lowest values for 1. 0 mm (482. 0 N), and 1. 5 mm groups (634. 8 N). e. max CAD showed highest values for 1. 0 mm (774. 2 N), and 1. 5 mm groups (1, 240. 8 N) ...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary notes The paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} surface evaluation of steel strips formed by longitudinal cold rolling, carried out by a rolling <b>mill</b> <b>DUO</b> 210 SVa. The experiments were performed on samples of low carbon structural steel {{in order to determine}} the impact of grain size of material with respect to technological parameters, particularly with respect to a rolling reduction and rolling force. Surface roughness of the steel strips was measured at three locations by an optical profilometer MicroProf FRT. These results were consequently mutually compared...|$|R
