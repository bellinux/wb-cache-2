40|$|Intravitreal {{cidofovir}} {{has been}} shown to be a long acting and highly efficacious treatment for CMV retinitis; however decrease in IOP is an adverse effect. We wanted to determine the effect of cidofovir on intraocular pressure (IOP) in the guinea pig, and rabbit eye to develop an animal model of cidofovir induced ocular hypotony and to study the histopathology of this toxicity. Twenty-eight guinea pig eyes were injected with cidofovir yielding final intravitreal concentrations of 25, 200, 625 and 2000 micrograms ml- 1. Eighteen eyes of pigmented rabbits were injected with cidofovir yielding final intravitreal concentrations of 625 and 2000 micrograms ml- 1. A carefully calibrated low volume <b>displacement</b> <b>manometer</b> system using a micro-transducer was used to determine the IOP measurements in the guinea pig and rabbit eyes. Histology was evaluated using light and electron microscopy. Injection of 6. 25 micrograms of cidofovir intravitreally (vitreous concentration of 25 micrograms ml- 1) is the highest non-toxic dose in the guinea pig; the IOP was unchanged at two and four weeks after injection with this dose; histologically the eyes were normal. A single injection of 50 micrograms of cidofovir intravitreally (vitreous concentration of 200 micrograms ml- 1) caused a long lasting (9. 3 mmHg) decrease in IOP (approximately 50 % of baseline). At this dose there were only mild and variable histologic changes in the ciliary body and the retina. Higher doses of 156. 25 micrograms and 500 micrograms of cidofovir (vitreous concentrations of 625, and 2000 micrograms ml- 1, respectively) caused moderate to severe ciliary body and retinal changes. In rabbit eyes there was a mild but statistically insignificant pressure drop with doses of 875 micrograms cidofovir intravitreally (vitreous concentration of 625 micrograms ml- 1); retina was within normal limits after injection with this dose, there were mild changes in the ciliary body. There was a total destruction of ciliary body and loss of nonpigmented epithelial cells with injections of 2800 micrograms of cidofovir intravitreally (vitreous concentration of 2000 micrograms ml- 1) : retina was relatively well preserved. The guinea pig eye shows similar reduction in IOP and ciliary body changes as are seen in the human eye after intravitreal cidofovir and also appears to have a similar dose-response curve. However, the reduction of IOP caused by cidofovir occurs in the guinea pig eye at a concentration 40 times higher than was observed in the human eye. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{hydraulic}} conductivity of the membranes surrounding the giant axon of the squid, Dosidicus gigas, was measured. In some axons the axoplasm was partially removed by suction. Perfusion was then established by insertion {{of a second}} pipette. In other axons the axoplasm was left intact and only one pipette was inserted. In both groups hydrostatic pressure was applied {{by means of a}} water column in a capillary <b>manometer.</b> <b>Displacement</b> of the meniscus in time gave the rate of fluid flowing across the axon sheath. In both groups osmotic differences across the membrane were established by the addition of a test molecule to the external medium which was seawater. The {{hydraulic conductivity}} determined by application of hydrostatic pressure was 10. 6 4 - 0. 8. 10 - 8 cm/sec cm H 20 in perfused axons and 3. 2 4 - 0. 6. 10 - 8 cm/sec cm H 20 in intact axons. When the driving force was an osmotic pressure gradient the conductivity was 4. 5 4 - 0. 6 X 10 - 1 ° cm/sec em HzO and 4. 8 4 - 0. 9 X 10 - 1 ° cm/sec em H 20 in perfused and intact axons, respectively. A comparable result was found when the internal solution was made hyperosmotic...|$|R

A comparable result was found when the internal solution was made hyperosmotic. The fluid flow was a linear function of the hydrostatic pressure up to 70 cm of water. Glycerol outflux and membrane conductance were increased 1. 6 and 1. 1 times by the application of hydrostatic pressure. These increments do not give an explanation of the difference between the filtration coefficients. Other possible explanations are suggested and discussed...|$|R
