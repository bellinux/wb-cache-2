40|$|Introduction: This paper raises {{questions}} about equality <b>in</b> <b>partnerships,</b> since imbalance <b>in</b> <b>partnerships</b> may effect collaboration outcomes in integrated care. We address aspects of equality <b>in</b> mandatory, public-public <b>partnerships,</b> {{from the perspective of}} municipal care. We have developed a questionnaire wherein the Norwegian Coordination Reform is an illustrative example. The following research question is addressed: What equality dimensions are important for municipals related to mandatory partnerships with hospitals? Theory/methods: Since we did not find any instrument to measure equality <b>in</b> <b>partnerships,</b> an explorative design was chosen. The development of the instrument was based on the theory on partnership and knowledge about the field and context. A national online survey was emitted to all 429 Norwegian municipalities in 2013. The response rate was in total 58 percent (n = 248). The data were mainly analysed using Principal component analysis. Results: It seems that the two dimensions “learning and expertise equality” and “contractual equality” collects reliable and valid data to measure aspects of equality <b>in</b> <b>partnerships.</b> Discussion: Partnerships are usually based on voluntarism. The results indicate that mandatory partnerships, within a public health care system, can be appropriate to equalize partnerships between health care providers at different care levels...|$|R
