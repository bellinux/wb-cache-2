5|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, the Griffin family is seen {{watching}} the Channel 5 News, with Tricia Takanawa then beginning an interview with Stephen Hawking. Hawking, who is paralyzed due to neuro-muscular dystrophy, is seen sitting in his wheelchair. After the camera cuts, Hawking then jumps up <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> and admits it is just an act, before deciding to go surfing at the nearby beach.|$|E
5|$|In Skinner's office, Krycek gets up <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> {{and starts}} leaving out the doorway. Skinner goes after him, then {{turns around and}} sees Miles {{approaching}} behind him. Skinner just manages to escape with Krycek (who was purposely closing the elevator doors on Skinner), but Miles' hand breaks through the elevator door, injuring Skinner and knocking him unconscious. At the hospital, Mulder distrusts what Doggett has been told by Knowle Rohrer, so the two {{set out to find}} out how trustworthy Rohrer really is. Meanwhile, at Doggett's abandoned hometown where Reyes and Scully are hiding out, Reyes sees someone running off and follows whoever it is. A car pulls up and she meets a trooper who agrees to help with the birth. As Mulder and Doggett pull into the garage, they find Krycek pulling up in another car, with a passenger who happens to be Rohrer. Mulder believes that Rohrer and Krycek are colluding together but don't understand how/what for. Doggett covertly pursues Rohrer and learns that Rohrer has an accomplice: Agent Crane.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, Donovan {{resigned}} <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>Chair</b> in the Melbourne Law School to {{join the}} diplomatic service, specialising as a trade representative. His appointments began as a Commercial Counsellor at the Australian Embassy in Rome, and then becoming a Minister (Commercial) in the Department of Foreign Trade, Commercial Adviser to the Australian High Commission, London, and Deputy Head of the Australian mission to the European Economic Community.|$|E

25|$|The next morning, Spooner, alone, stands <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> and {{attempts}} to leave, but the door is locked. Briggs soon enters to deliver Spooner food and champagne, rambling on about how he met Foster and ignoring Spooner's desire {{to know why the}} door was locked. Spooner thinks of a quick excuse to leave; however, when Briggs mentions that both Foster and Hirst are poets, Spooner shows vague recognition of this fact.|$|E
25|$|This {{position}} was subsequently abandoned, as theologians such as A. B. Bruce, Marcus Dods and George Adam Smith began {{to teach a}} more liberal understanding of the faith. 'Believing criticism' of the Bible was a central approach taught by such as William Robertson Smith and he was dismissed <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> by the Assembly in 1881. Attempts were made between 1890 and 1895 to bring many of these professors to the bar of the Assembly on charges of heresy, but these moves failed, with only minor warnings being issued.|$|E
25|$|Professor Codera then retired <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> in the Arabic Language at the Universidad de Madrid {{in order}} to create room there for Asín; Ribera in Zaragoza allowed Asín to leave to assume this Madrid cátedra in 1903. Professor Asín lived in the same well-connected {{boarding}} house as Codera, and was well received in the university. By 1905 Professor Ribera had also come to Madrid; together with Asín they soon founded the journal Cultura Española (1906–1909). Asín attended international conferences in Algeria (1905) and Copenhagen (1908), where he engaged other Arabists and academics in Islamic studies. In Madrid he continued to prosper, eventually being admitted to the royal court where he gained the friendship of Alfonso XIII.|$|E

25|$|Norton de Matos {{returned}} to teaching, accepting {{a position as}} professor at the Instituto Superior Técnico, but was dismissed <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> He then became a leading opposition figure against the Salazar regime. In 1943, he {{was named to the}} National Council of Movement of National Antifascist Unity, or MUNAF, and on his 81st birthday, he was named the candidate of the opposition now united under the Movement of Democratic Unity (MUD, the successor organization to the MUNAF after 1945) for President in the rigged election of 1949, under the dictatorial Estado Novo regime, while demanding freedom to advertise his message and the close inspection of votes. The regime refused these demands, and Norton de Matos withdrew from the election on February 12, 1949.|$|E
25|$|The {{strain of}} {{carrying}} the Premiership and Foreign Office {{contributed to his}} second stroke at 10 Downing Street after dinner {{on the evening of}} 23 June 1953. Despite being partially paralysed down one side, he presided over a Cabinet meeting the next morning without anybody noticing his incapacity. Thereafter his condition deteriorated, and it was thought that he might not survive the weekend. Had Eden been fit, Churchill's premiership would most likely have been over. News of this was kept from the public and from Parliament, who were told that Churchill was suffering from exhaustion. He went to his country home, Chartwell, to recuperate, {{and by the end of}} June he astonished his doctors by being able, dripping with perspiration, to lift himself upright <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> He joked that news of his illness had chased the trial of the serial killer John Christie off the front pages.|$|E
25|$|While in the garden, the {{children}} are surprised to see Ben Weatherstaff looking over the wall on a ladder. Startled and angry to find {{the children}} in the secret garden, he admits that he believed Colin to be a cripple. Colin stands up <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> and finds that his legs are fine, though weak from long disuse. Colin soon spends every day in the garden, sometimes with Dickon as company. The children conspire to keep Colin's recovering health a secret, so as to surprise his father, who is travelling abroad. As Colin's health improves, his father sees a coinciding increase in spirits, culminating in a dream where his late wife calls to him from inside the garden. When he receives a letter from Mrs Sowerby, he takes the opportunity finally to return home. He walks the outer garden wall in his wife's memory, but hears voices inside, finds the door unlocked, and is shocked to see the garden in full bloom, and his son healthy. The servants watch, stunned, as Mr Craven and Colin walk back to the manor together.|$|E

25|$|The sudden {{increase}} in popularity of Spock caused William Shatner, who portrayed Captain James T. Kirk, to be dismayed {{that he was}} not portraying the favourite character. Although he was being paid $5,000 an episode, plus a percentage of profits, and Nimoy was being paid $1,250 an episode, it was the latter who was receiving several sacks of fan mail a week. The fan mail figures were leaked to the press, angering Shatner. This animosity from Shatner increased when reporters from Time arrived at the studio and set up for a photoshoot around Nimoy's makeup chair. Shatner and James Doohan were also in the makeup room, and Doohan later recalled that once Shatner realised he was being ignored, he jumped <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> shouted that he was the Captain of the show and from then on he would have his makeup applied in his trailer. The popularity of Spock had built to the extent that gossip columnists in Hollywood spread rumours among agents that Shatner was going to be dropped from the series and replaced with Nimoy as the lead.|$|E
25|$|There {{were then}} {{questions}} about Pinochet's allegedly fragile health. After medical tests, Home Secretary Jack Straw ruled in January 2000 {{that he should}} not be extradited. This triggered protests from human rights NGOs, and led in January 2000 the Belgian government, along with six human rights groups (including Amnesty International), to depose a complaint against Straw's decision before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Belgium, as well as France and Switzerland, had deposed extradition requests in the wake of Spain's demand. Despite the protests of legal and medical experts from several countries, Straw finally ruled, in March 2000, to set free Pinochet and authorize his free return to Chile. On 3 March 2000 Pinochet returned to Chile. His first act when landing in Santiago de Chile's airport was to triumphally stand up <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> to acclaim his supporters. He was first greeted by his successor as head of the Chilean Armed Forces, General Ricardo Izurieta. President Ricardo Lagos, who had just sworn in on 11 March, said the retired general's televised arrival had damaged the image of Chile, while thousands demonstrated against him.|$|E
500|$|Freeman retired <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>Chair</b> in 1997, and was {{succeeded by}} Len Lindoy FAA. [...] Nevertheless, he {{continued}} working {{in research and}} became Emeritus Professor of Chemistry and Emeritus Professor of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences. [...] He also voluntarily continued teaching at first-year level. [...] His lecturing was described as [...] "charismatic" [...] and [...] "teaching was a love and a privilege and never an obligation" [...] for him.|$|E

500|$|Lax did {{encounter}} {{some criticism}} during his tenure. Whilst {{at the university}} he [...] "never, as far as is known, delivered a single lecture", despite his chair's bequest that the holder deliver forty lectures each year, although his predecessor had not given any lectures either. The excuse was made that there was already an astronomical chair at Cambridge established before the Lowndean that already gave lectures. By the 1820s {{it was no longer}} acceptable to consider chairs as sinecures, and Lax received criticism from a living descendent of the original benefactor, Thomas Lowndes, for being remiss in his duties. His successor to the Lowndean chair George Peacock promised [...] "to do his duty in a less lax manner than his predecessor", and although he struggled to get anyone to attend his lectures on pure mathematics, his lectures on practical astronomy were well attended. However, Peacock's translation as Dean of Ely three years later meant that he was largely absent <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> which he was severely criticised for retaining.|$|E
500|$|Charles suspected, {{probably}} correctly, {{that some}} members of the English Parliament had colluded with the invading Scots. On 3 January 1642, Charles directed Parliament to give up five members of the Commons – Pym, John Hampden, Denzil Holles, William Strode and Sir Arthur Haselrig – and one peer – Lord Mandeville – on the grounds of high treason. When Parliament refused, it was possibly Henrietta Maria who persuaded Charles to arrest the five members by force, which Charles intended to carry out personally. However, news of the warrant reached Parliament ahead of him, and the wanted men slipped away by boat shortly before Charles entered the House of Commons with an armed guard on 4 January. Having displaced the Speaker, William Lenthall, <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> the king asked him where the MPs had fled. Lenthall, on his knees, famously replied, [...] "May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here." [...] Charles abjectly declared [...] "all my birds have flown", and was forced to retire, empty-handed.|$|E
500|$|Fillmore {{had been}} called <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> {{presiding}} over the Senate on July 8, and had sat {{with members of the}} cabinet in a vigil outside Taylor's bedroom at the White House. He received the formal notification of the president's death, signed by the cabinet, on the evening of July 9 in his residence at the Willard Hotel. [...] After acknowledging the letter, and spending a sleepless night, Fillmore went to the House of Representatives, where, at a joint session of Congress, he took the oath as president from William Cranch, chief judge of the federal court for the District of Columbia, and the man who had sworn in President Tyler. The cabinet officers, as was customary when a new president took over, submitted their resignations, expecting Fillmore to refuse, allowing them to continue in office. Fillmore had been marginalized by the cabinet members, and the new president accepted the resignations, though he asked them to stay on for a month, which most refused to do. Fillmore is the only president who succeeded by death or resignation not to retain, at least initially, his predecessor's cabinet. He was already in discussions with Whig leaders, and on July 20 began to send new nominations to the Senate, with the Fillmore cabinet to be led by Webster as Secretary of State. Webster had outraged his Massachusetts constituents by supporting Clay's bill, and with his Senate term to expire in 1851, had no electoral future in his home state. Fillmore appointed his old law partner, Nathan Hall, as Postmaster General, a cabinet position that controlled many patronage appointments. The new department heads were mostly supporters of the Compromise, as was Fillmore.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson died at his {{plantation}} on June 8, 1845, {{at the age}} of 78, {{of chronic}} tuberculosis, dropsy, and heart failure.
