40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether <b>hospital</b> <b>controls</b> {{could be used in}} case-control studies with minimal bias, where resource constraints limit recruitment of community controls. <b>Hospital</b> <b>controls</b> and community controls were compared for socio-demographic and risk factor variables in a study of Smokeless Tobacco (SLT) use and Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) in Bangladesh in 2010. Incident cases of CHD and <b>hospital</b> <b>controls</b> were selected from cardiac hospitals. Community controls were selected from neighbourhoods of CHD cases. We enrolled 302 cases, 302 <b>hospital</b> <b>controls,</b> and 1208 community controls. Distribution of age, gender, marital status, occupation, and socio-economic status was similar between <b>hospital</b> <b>controls</b> and community controls. Compared to community controls, <b>hospital</b> <b>controls</b> were more educated, had higher rates of hypertension and reported more family history of heart diseases. But they reported relatively less physical activity. Current use of SLT was higher amongst community controls compared to <b>hospital</b> <b>controls,</b> but was not significant (adjusted OR 0. 81, 95 % CI 0. 58 - 1. 12). Current use of SLT was not associated with an increased risk of CHD when community controls were used (adjusted OR 0. 87, 95 % CI 0. 63 to 1. 19, p> 0. 05), nor when <b>hospital</b> <b>controls</b> were used (adjusted OR 1. 00, 95 % CI 0. 63 to 1. 60, p> 0. 05). There were significant differences between two control groups but only on confounding variables which could be measured and adjusted for during multivariate analyses.

40|$|A {{case-control study}} of colon adenoma in {{relation}} to dietary habits was undertaken in Saitama, Japan. The population included 105 patients with newly diagnosed colon adenoma, 843 general population controls, and 84 <b>hospital</b> <b>controls</b> who had no pathologic lesions at colonoscopy. The adenoma patients and the <b>hospital</b> <b>controls</b> underwent total colonoscopy between November 1992 and March 1994. Information about diet, cigarette smoking and alcohol use were obtained with a self-administered questionnaire. Unconditional logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} compare adenoma patients with general population controls and with <b>hospital</b> <b>controls.</b> We found that current cigarette smokers had a higher risk (OR = 2. 86, CI = 1. 20 - 6. 80) than did nonsmoking <b>hospital</b> <b>controls.</b> Current alcohol use did not affect the risk of colon adenoma.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis deals with a study of serum retinol and related factors in patients with epithelial tumours (cervical, endometrial, and bladder carcinoma) and non epithelial tumours (malignant melanomas and sarcomas). In addition, dietary retinol and beta carotene intakes were measured in the epithelial cancer studies. The patients with cervical cancer had significantly lower serum concentrations of retinol, carotenoids, retinol binding protein (RBP) and prealbumin (PA) and significantly higher serum copper concentrations than both healthy volunteers and <b>hospital</b> <b>controls.</b> Serum concentrations of the parameters measured were similar in patients with pre-malignant cervical changes and <b>hospital</b> <b>controls.</b> Dietary preformed retinol, total retinol and beta carotene intakes of patients with malignant and pre-malignant cervical disease {{were not significantly different}} from <b>hospital</b> <b>controls.</b> Serum concentrations of retinol, carotenoids, RBP and PA were significantly lower in patients with advanced cervical cancer than in patients with early disease. Dietary intake of retinol and beta carotene was not lower in patients with advanced disease. Notable differences in serum and dietary parameters were observed between <b>hospital</b> <b>controls</b> and volunteers, and for some parameters larger differences occurred between the two groups of controls than between <b>hospital</b> <b>controls</b> and cancer patients. Possible reasons for this are discussed. Serum concentrations of retinol, RBP, and copper were similar in endometrial cancer patients and <b>hospital</b> <b>controls.</b> Serum concentrations of carotenoids were significantly lower in endometrial cancer patients than in controls. Serum retinol and associated factors were very similar in patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and in patients previously treated for bladder cancer; {{there were no significant differences}} between these two groups and the controls. Dietary intake in the three groups were also similar. In contrast to cervical cancer, the majority of patients with endometrial and bladder carcinoma had early disease. Serum concentrations of retinol, carotenoids, RBP and PA were significantly lower in patients with sarcomas when compared to <b>hospital</b> <b>controls.</b> In contrast, in patients with malignant melanoma the level of carotenoids and prealbumin in the serum were significantly lower than in controls while levels of retinol and RBP were similar to controls. Possible reasons for the lower levels of retinol and associated factors in some groups of cancer patients are discussed. The problems and limitations of estimates of dietary vitamin A intake are also discussed.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that the prevalence of smoking among hospital patients is {{greater than that of}} the general population because many conditions for which patients are hospitalized are caused by or associated with smoking, and that this increased prevalence may bias results of case-control studies of tobacco-related diseases. For this reason, many authors have suggested excluding from the control series patients hospitalized for tobacco-related illnesses. The present study investigated potential selection bias for hospital compared to neighborhood controls in studying tobacco-related diseases. The 709 cases from six U. S. cities had tobacco-related cancers or myocardial infarction. They were individually matched to one hospital control and to one neighbor. After excluding patients with tobacco-related diseases, <b>hospital</b> <b>controls</b> were less often current smokers and more often former smokers than neighborhood controls. Among male ever smokers, <b>hospital</b> <b>controls</b> tended to smoke more cigarettes per day than neighborhood controls. Compared with the U. S. population, there was an over-representation of smokers in neighborhood controls rather than an under-representation of smokers in <b>hospital</b> <b>controls.</b> Relative risk estimates varied according to type of control. Choosing between hospital and neighborhood controls in case-control studies should be dictated by criteria related to the study hypothesis, participation, or cost. In particular, exclusion of <b>hospital</b> <b>controls</b> with diseases known to be tobacco-related seems to be a successful strategy for reducing selection bias...|$|E

Most factors were taken directly from parental interviews, but two factors related to parental occupational exposures were blindly coded by chemists. Hospital and population controls were compared using odds ratios estimated from logistic regression. Cases were compared with both types of controls with the same statistical method. Prevalence data from ongoing population surveys were compared with reported prevalence in controls. From the former comparisons and the distribution of socioeconomic variables, results suggested that study groups came from the same base population. Nevertheless, reported and coded exposures among <b>hospital</b> <b>controls</b> were closer to those of cases than to those of population controls.

Methods: A matched case-control study of non-smoking Bangladeshi adults aged 40 – 75 years was conducted in 2010. Incident cases of CHD were selected from two cardiac hospitals. Community controls, matched to CHD cases, were selected from neighbourhoods, and <b>hospital</b> <b>controls</b> were selected from outpatient departments of the same hospitals. The Rose Angina Questionnaire (RAQ) was also used to re-classify cases and controls.

Little information exists on differences between population and <b>hospital</b> <b>controls</b> in case-control studies on cancers in Chinese hospital setting. Methods We conducted three parallel case-control studies on leukemia, breast and colorectal cancers in China between 2009 and 2010, using population and <b>hospital</b> <b>controls</b> to separately match 540 incident cases by age, gender and residency at a 1 : 1 ratio. Demographic and lifestyle factors were measured using a validated questionnaire in face-to-face interview. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained using conditional logistic regression analyses. Results The two control groups had closely similar exposure distributions of 15 out of 16 factors, with the only exception being that <b>hospital</b> <b>controls</b> were less likely to have a BMI ≥ 25 (OR = 0. 71, 95 % CI: 0. 54, 0. 93). For exposure of green tea drinking, the adjusted ORs (95 % CIs) comparing green tealeaves intake ≥ 1000 grams annually with non-drinkers were 0. 51 (0. 31, 0. 83) and 0. 21 (0. 27, 0. 74) for three cancers combined, 0. 06 (0. 01, 0. 61) and 0. 07 (0. 01, 0. 47) for breast cancer, 0. 52 (0. 29, 0. 94) and 0. 45 (0. 25, 0. 82) for colorectal cancer, 0. 65 (0. 08, 5. 63) and 0. 57 (0. 07, 4. 79) for leukemia using hospital and population controls respectively.
