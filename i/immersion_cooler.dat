50|$|Open or semi-open bath <b>immersion</b> <b>cooling</b> is a {{data center}} cooling {{technique}} that implies fully submerging servers in dielectric coolant fluid. It is called open or semi-open bath because servers are placed side-by-side in large tanks that function as baths. These baths operate at atmospheric pressure {{and allow the}} coolant fluid to be moved through the hardware components or servers submerged in it.Open Bath <b>Immersion</b> <b>Cooling</b> uses single-phase dielectric liquids. These liquids always remain in liquid state while operating. They never boil or freeze. The oil is usually pumped to an external heat exchanger where it is cooled thanks to heat exchange with a cooler water-circuit. A different approach uses natural convection as the driving force to circulate the oil through the servers. and a water cooled heat exchanger. This technique uses “open baths“ as there’s little (or no) risk of the coolant evaporating. In semi-open bath <b>Immersion</b> <b>Cooling,</b> a two-phase chemically engineered liquid is the working fluid. It literally boils thanks to its low boiling point and thus exists in both a liquid and gas phase. The system takes advantage of a concept known as “latent heat” which is the heat (thermal energy) required to change the phase of a fluid (in this case two-phase dielectric mineral oil). The oil is only cooled by boiling and thus remains at the boiling point (“saturation temperature”). Energy transferred from the servers into the two-phase oil will cause a portion of it to boil off into a gas (this is {{the second phase of}} the oil). The gas rises above the liquid oil level where it contacts a condenser which is cooler than the saturation temperature. This causes the vapoured oil to condense back into a liquid form and fall (rain) back into the bath.|$|R

A dielectric liquid, HFE – 7100 was used as the working fluid in the saturated boiling tests. Twelve types of 1 -cm 2 copper heater samples, simulating high heat flux components, featured reference smooth copper surface, fully and patterned hydrophobic surface and fully and patterned hydrophilic surfaces. Hydrophobic samples were prepared by applying a thin Teflon coating following photolithography techniques, while the hydrophilic TiO 2 thin films were made through a two step approach involving layer by layer self assembly and liquid phase deposition processes. Patterned surfaces had circular dots with sizes between 40 – 250 μm. Based on additional data, both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces improved nucleate boiling performance that is evaluated in terms of boiling incipience, heat transfer coefficient and critical heat flux (CHF) level.

These factors necessitate the development of new heat transfer fluids with improved heat transfer properties and applicability. Computer Aided Molecular Design (CAMD) approach was used in this work to systematically design novel heat transfer fluids that exhibit significantly better properties than those of current high performance electronic coolants. The candidate fluids generated by CAMD were constrained by limiting their boiling points, latent heat of vaporization and thermal conductivity.

The increased popularity of solid state systems with the technological developments have led them to be a favorable choice for many lighting applications besides electronics.

One popular technology, <b>immersion</b> <b>cooling</b> using pool boiling, is limited by a catastrophic transition from nucleate to film boiling at a well-defined critical heat flux limit. The present work used an acoustic emitter located near the heated surface to actively control the boiling process. When vapor bubbles reached a predetermined size, the acoustic field forced them to detach from the heated surface. This led to an increase in the heat transfer rate and a delay in the transition from nucleate to film boiling. Preliminary work demonstrated acoustically enhanced bubble detachment from a heated surface over a frequency range of kHz to MHz. For water, the critical heat flux limit was increased from 107 W/cm 2 at 122 °C to 299 W/cm 2 at 136 °C.
