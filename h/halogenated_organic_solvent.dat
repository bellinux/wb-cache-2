It is located at the mouth of the Tordera River, the coastal aquifer of which was declared officially protected in 2003 due to both the drought of that time and to the heavy water extractions. Three main measures undertaken by the Catalan Water Agency were: i) the construction of a 10 hm 3 /year desalination plant (2002), to reduce groundwater extraction; ii) the construction of a water reclamation facility (Title- 22, 2003), to stop the discharge of effluent into the sea and to favour the aquifer recharge; and iii) the regulation of the aquifer extractions.

Because of the numerous advantages of macromolecular systems, including solution processing and mechanical flexibility, conjugated polymers have become a burgeoning field of research with the hopes of producing cost-effective solution-based electronics. Importantly, optoelectronic device performance is heavily influenced by conjugated polymer backbone orientation and overall thin film morphology. As such, the processing conditions of these systems {{are important to the}} construction of high- performance optoelectronics. Polythiophenes are model conjugated polymers that have been studied extensively in <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvents.</b> However, the self- assembly of these systems from dilute solution to the solid state remains ambiguous for solvents with high dielectric constants. Here, two derivative compounds of poly(3 -hexylthiophene) are correspondingly investigated in high dielectric solvents by way of ultraviolet-visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering, polarized optical microscopy, and four- point probe conductivity measurements. In dilute solutions, both systems are found to undergo self-assembly when exposed to various stimuli, including temperature, solvent composition, and side-chain characteristics. The kinetics of these transitions are investigated, and a model is put forth to explain contrasting self-assembly mechanisms. At higher concentrations, both systems form lyotropic liquid crystalline phases. Characteristics of the liquid crystalline phases are found to be heavily influenced by dilute solution self-assembly mechanisms and processing. Through the application of a mechanical shear force along still-wet liquid crystal films, alignment of the polythiophene long axis is attained. This morphological characteristic is found to carry over to the solid-state for both systems, and clear optoelectronic anisotropy of the thin films is observed. As such, these methodologies may provide a route to the production of environmentally friendly high-performance optoelectronic devices...|$|R
40|$|Introduction & Objective: <b>Organic</b> <b>solvents</b> have a {{broad range}} of {{application}} in industry. Hepatotoxicity of different <b>organic</b> <b>halogenated</b> <b>solvents</b> like carbon tetrachloride has been verified in numerous studies however, studies investigating the association between the occupational exposure with aromatic <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> like benzene, toluene & xylene and hepatic toxicity are limited. The goal {{of this study was to}} review the long term effects of exposure with mixture of aromatic <b>organic</b> <b>solvents,</b> in higher amounts of permissible level, on hepatic system. Materials & methods: This is a cross sectional study which was conducted in an automobile plant. Workers employed in the painting saloon were considered as cases and workers in assembly as controls. A questionnaire, containing demographic data like age and years of employment, was completed for each of 349 workers. After considering exclusion criteria, liver enzyme level (AST, ALT & ALP) of 163 case workers was compared with 186 controls. Concentration of mixture of <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> in painting saloon was twice and a half as much of the permissible level. The collected data was analyzed by the SPSS software, using T score, K 2 and Linear Regression. Results: The Mean level of ALP in case group was significantly higher than the control group (P< 0. 001). For AST and ALT the mean was higher in the case group but this difference was not statistically significant. Increase in ALP level had a significant association with BMI (P< 0. 001) and smoking (P= 0. 007) yet, no significant relation was seen with age and years of employment. Conclusion: Our study suggested that exposure with mixture of aromatic <b>organic</b> <b>solvents,</b> in higher amounts of permissible level, can cause mild functional liver damage (cholestatic type). So, it is recommended to use liver function tests, especially ALP, for screening of workers exposed to mixture of aromatic <b>organic</b> <b>solvents,</b> for preliminary detection of hepatic dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|Total organic halogen (TOX) is a {{collective}} parameter and a toxicity indicator {{for all the}} <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> disinfection byproducts (DBPs) in a water sample. TOX measurement involves concentration of <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> DBPs by adsorption onto activated carbon. Prior to activated carbon adsorption, quenching the chlorine residual in a water sample is an indispensable step to eliminate the positive interference resulting from continued chlorination with organic compounds adsorbed on the activated carbon surface or with the activated carbon surface itself. Arsenite is generally applied as the quenching agent. In this study, the arsenite quenching agent dose that was 100 % of the stoichiometric amount of the chlorine residual in a water sample was demonstrated to be most appropriate. In practice, to ensure complete reduction of chlorine residual, slight overdose of arsenite is often recommended, but this was found to cause negative interferences in the TOX measurement due to two reasons. First, the competitive adsorption existed between <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> DBPs and the excessive arsenite on the activated carbon. This competitive adsorption effect was pronounced within a quenching time of 15 min. After 15 min of quenching, a large fraction of arsenite might have reacted with some easily-reduced halogenated DBPs to become arsenate, which is partially ionized at pH 2 and less likely adsorbed on the activated carbon. In this case, more <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> DBPs could be adsorbed on the activated carbon, resulting in the measured TOX concentrations to be {{much closer to the}} actual one contained in the sample. Second, excessive arsenite might lead to reduction or decomposition of <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> DBPs with a prolonged quenching time (> 60 min).
