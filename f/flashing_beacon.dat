40|$|Wrong-way crashes are a {{major cause}} for safety concern along freeways and limited access facilities. This study {{investigated}} three {{different aspects of the}} use of Rectangular Rapid <b>Flashing</b> <b>Beacons</b> (RRFBs) : 1) different settings of red RRFBs and their perceived effectiveness on reducing wrong-way driving based on a public opinion survey, 2) the effect of active red RRFBs on the behavior of drivers traveling on adjacent roadways via a before-and-after study, and 3) the effectiveness of red RRFBs on alleviating wrong-way driving on freeway off-ramps by analyzing the percentage of vehicles turning back after observing the red RRFB activation. Based on the public opinion survey results, the most informative warning red RRFB combination was determined and implemented in this study. The evaluation of the impact of red RRFB implementation (at six I- 275 off-ramps in Tampa, FL, USA) on driving behaviors along adjacent arterials indicated that the implementation of red RRFBs did not adversely impact driving behaviors on adjacent arterials. To determine the effectiveness of red <b>flashing</b> <b>beacons</b> and RRFBs on alleviating wrong-way driving on freeway off-ramps, video recordings of red <b>flashing</b> <b>beacons</b> and RRFBs mounted on wrong-way signs were analyzed. Red RRFBs were deemed to be a more effective countermeasure to deter wrong-way driving than red <b>flashing</b> <b>beacons.</b> Six-months of video data were collected for red <b>flashing</b> <b>beacons</b> mounted on wrong-way signs, and video data collection for red RRFBs mounted on wrong-way signs is currently underway. For red <b>flashing</b> <b>beacons,</b> a high percentage of wrong-way drivers in this study made a U-turn and went back in the correct traffic flow direction upon realizing they were traveling in the wrong direction. It is expected that red RRFBs will be more effective on alleviating wrong-way driving due to their capabilities to inform drivers of wrong-way driving than those from red <b>flashing</b> <b>beacons.</b> The video data analysis for red RRFBs will be presented in a separate paper...|$|R

500|$|The lights, and, by extension, the {{flashlight}} and <b>flash</b> <b>beacon,</b> {{are found in}} all main games, excluding the third. While use varies per game, lights are generally used to ward off animatronics, or warn the player of their presence. Lights {{in the first game}} and second games are activated via buttons mounted into the walls, and light up the player's 'blind spot', being the doorway or vent exit, respectively. The fifth game has the lights work similarly, however, they are now mounted onto a control pad, and serve no purpose other than the ability to see the animatronics, due to the different gameplay style. [...] The flashlight in the second and fourth game works in the same fashion as its real life counterpart, {{in the sense that it}} has a limited battery life, albeit only in the second game, and must be toggled on and off. The <b>flash</b> <b>beacon</b> was introduced in Sister Location, and is used to quickly gather bearings in the pitch black room seen on the third and fifth nights.|$|R

Although the boat was powered by a Merc Cruiser L-6 stern drive and Attwood Corporation manufactured the hardwire, a water squirter and a jet nozzle were added to make the Batboat look like it was nuclear-powered. It took 31 days to build.|$|E
2500|$|A {{study at}} Loughborough University in the United Kingdom showed that strobe {{lighting}} conveyed {{a greater sense}} of urgency to other road users, with the faster the flash the greater urgency, potentially helping to speed the emergency vehicle through traffic. [...] It also concluded that factors such as flash pattern were important, with simultaneously <b>flashing</b> <b>beacons</b> attracting attention far quicker than alternately flashing versions, although this did increase discomfort glare. [...] In general, as light intensity and the number of beacons present increased, the time it took to gain the attention of other drivers decreased.|$|R

At least one manufacturer allows user programming of the features of the flashlight through a USB port. An electronic control may also provide an indication of remaining battery capacity, or automatic step-down of brightness as the battery nears full discharge.|$|E
50|$|The {{light at}} Presque Isle was not {{installed}} with {{any sort of}} flashing system, though the option was left available. Often, boats are able to distinguish between two different lights by a <b>Flashing</b> <b>beacon.</b> Either the beacon itself would rotate, and thus illuminate 360° around the lighthouse, or a blinder with {{only a small portion}} unshielded would rotate around the lamp, exposing the bright light for only a few seconds. The rotation was controlled by heavy weights that would slowly sink due to gravity. Every few hours the lightkeeper would “wind up” the rotating beacon or blinder. However, Presque Isle's light was a steady beacon.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} {{portion of}} the route began at Airport Road {{just north of the}} Zanesville Municipal Airport. SR 797 traveled north along Airport Road just north of the intersection with Airpark Drive (Muskingum County Road 797). The road is lined with small homes. The route intersected US 22 and US 40 at a four-way stop intersection with a <b>flashing</b> <b>beacon.</b> The intersection of the routes was amidst a commercial strip that typically appears adjacent to a freeway interchange. The highway traveled a very short distance from this intersection to the northwest before it meets I-70 at its exit 160, a diamond interchange. This point served as SR 797's endpoint. Continuing northwest from this location is Sonora Road (CR 52).|$|E
