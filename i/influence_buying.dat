This thesis was conducted using a qualitative interview with a procurement manager at Norrbotten County Council procurement unit. The qualitative data collected was then analyzed using a frame of reference that was constructed previous to the interview. The findings of this thesis showed that customer satisfaction <b>influenced</b> the organizational <b>buying</b> behavior of public hospitals conducting public procurement. The findings showed that customer satisfaction <b>influenced</b> the <b>buying</b> behaviors in two ways. One of the ways customer satisfaction <b>influences</b> <b>buying</b> decisions is through the users’ perception of customer satisfaction. If the users are found dissatisfied the consequence to this will be revealed in the next public procurement process where the specification of what is sough is then changed. The other way in which customer satisfaction <b>influences</b> the <b>buying</b> behavior found was concerning the specification itself. This customer satisfaction is more direct, if the supplier fails to live up to the specification disconfirmation occurs. This disconfirmation can lead to the removal of a supplier from their contract, or the disregard from future contracts if the conflict is thoroughly documented.

It was specifically {{carried out to}} examine consumer buying decision making process and assess cultural, economic as well as personal factors <b>influencing</b> clothes <b>buying</b> behavior. Data for the study were gathered through structured questionnaire administered by the researcher {{with the help of}} two research assistants, on a sample of 192 clothes buyers, out of which, 174 were duly filled and returned. The data obtained were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi square, Analysis of variance and multi-stage regression. Findings revealed a highly significant influence of {{cultural factors}} (T= 14. 83, P< 0. 000) on consumer buying behaviour of which the relative regression coefficient influences equivalence of societal norms (24. 6 %) was the highest. The findings also indicated a highly significant influence of economic factors (T= 11. 89, P< 0. 000) factor on consumer buying behaviour with the highest relative regression coefficient influence equivalence exerted by income (20 %).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{describe}} how customer perceived value <b>influences</b> the <b>buying</b> decisions for public hospitals conducting public procurement. This thesis was conducted using a qualitative interview with a procurement manager at the Norrbotten County Council procurement unit. This qualitative data was then analyzed using a frame of reference constructed using current customer perceived value literature, and organizational buying literature. The findings shows that customer perceived value <b>influences</b> the <b>buying</b> decisions of public hospitals conducting public procurement mainly in the initial part of the procurement process. The findings suggests that the public organizations perception of value is not as highly dependent on the trade-off moment between benefit and sacrifice as literature suggests. Instead the public organizations perception of value that <b>influences</b> <b>buying</b> decisions exists {{in the form of}} specification of benefit sought, and specified evaluation method to establish value. The public organizations perception of value is highly influential for buying behavior, thus understanding how public hospitals expresses their sought value is critical for long term success of supplying towards public hospitals.

As goods and services become more of a commodity, it is what a shopper experiences and what atmosphere retailers create that really matters.

50|$|Color {{is used as}} a {{means to}} attract {{consumer}} attention to a product that then influences buying behavior. Consumers use color to identify for known brands or search for new alternatives. Variety seekers look for non-typical colors when selecting new brands. And attractive color packaging receives more consumer attention than unattractive color packaging, which can then <b>influence</b> <b>buying</b> behavior. A study that looked at visual color cues focused on predicted purchasing behavior for known and unknown brands. Participants were shown the same product in four different colors and brands. The results showed that people picked packages based on colors that attracted their voluntary and involuntary attention. Associations made with that color such as 'green fits menthol', also affected their decision. Based on these findings implications can be made on the best color choices for packages. New companies or new products could consider using dissimilar colors to attract attention to the brand, however, off brand companies could consider using similar colors to the leading brand to emphasize product similarity. If a company is changing the look of a product, but keeping the product the same, they consider keeping the same color scheme since people use color to identify and search for brands. This can be seen in Crayola crayons, where the logo has changed many times since 1934, but the basic package colors, gold and green, have been kept throughout.|$|E

5000|$|Aradhna Krishna {{organized}} the first academic conference on sensory marketing (in 2008), bringing together psychologists, neuroscientists, marketing academics and practitioners. She defines sensory marketing as “marketing that engages the consumers' senses and affects their perception, judgment and behavior (and suggests that) from a managerial perspective, sensory marketing {{can be used}} to create subconscious triggers that characterize consumer perceptions of abstract notions of the product (e.g., its sophistication or quality)”.In more than fifty published articles, Aradhna Krishna has explored ways in which a product’s look, feel, taste, sound, and smell contribute to how it is perceived, and how people respond to it. Illustrating her research, she also edited and contributed to the book, Sensory Marketing: Research on the Sensuality of Products, in 2009. She also runs an international sensory marketing research laboratory.In 2013, she published a book, Customer Sense: How the 5 Senses <b>Influence</b> <b>Buying</b> Behavior, which Kirkus Reviews calls [...] "A sophisticated, easy-handed elucidation of the practice of marketing to our senses". [...] Some important concepts introduced by Professor Krishna's work are perceived consumption, guiltless gluttony, and Smellizing. Raghubir and Krishna (1999) show that container shapes can impact perceived consumption, which is how much consumers think they have eaten or drunk as opposed to how much they have actually eaten or drunk. Aydinoglu and Krishna (2011) show that food size labels (e.g., a large size portion of French fries being labeled medium) can result in believing that one has not eaten too much and thus not feeling guilty about it (guiltless gluttony). Smellizing is a term coined by Prof. Krishna (Krishna, Morrin and Sayin 2014) to reflect “imagining smells”. Krishna, Morrin and Sayin (2014) show that smellizing foods can result in similar physiological responses (salivation) as real smells, when a picture of the food is also available.Besides sensory marketing, she works on designing winning cause marketing and corporate social responsibility programs, and on constructing engaging pricing and promotion policies.The implications of Aradhna Krishna’s research and expertise have been recognized not only within academia, but within business in general, being frequently quoted in outlets such as Time magazine, The New York Times, and the Telegraph, among others.|$|E

40|$|Contracts are an {{economic}} tool used to arrange transactions {{which are not}} tradable in simple spot markets. This thesis focuses on the implications {{of different kinds of}} contracts to understand behavior in complicated interactions. The first part of this thesis focuses on explicit formal contracts that provide non-linear payoffs and examines theoretically and empirically the implications for effort and risk-taking. The second part of this thesis focuses in contrast on implicit contracts. Starting from a theoretical perspective about how implicit contracts for <b>influence</b> <b>buying</b> might work in a setting that precludes explicit contracts. This helps explains empirical puzzles as well as has new predictions. I then show empirical evidence consistent with the predictions. In the first part, I explore managerial incentive contracts. Managerial incentives induce risk-taking as well as effort. Theoretical research has long considered risk-taking a potential side effect of incentives, but empirical investigation is limited. This thesis first develops nuanced predictions about how contracts in use in many industries induce risk-taking and effort. The contracts considered match closely those used in real-world contracts. The thesis then uses exogenous variation in hedge fund manager's incentives, one of the settings where these contracts are used, to examine both performance and risk-taking. I find that, consistent with theory, being farther below a key incentive threshold increases risk-taking and decreases performance. On average, a manager's risk-taking increases 50 percent and their performance falls 2. 1 percentage points when he is below the incentive threshold. I also show, consistent with the theoretical predictions, risk-taking behavior is non-monotonic; very distant managers take less risk and perform better than less distant managers. Further, I examine the role of organizational features in impacting the responsiveness to explicit incentives and the mechanisms managers use to increase risk. My results highlight the importance of risk-taking in response to incentives designed to induce effort and inform empirical research, contract design, practitioners, and policy makers. The results also show that moral hazard, not just selection, is an important determination of manager performance. In the second part, I explore contracts for <b>influence</b> <b>buying.</b> Existing empirical evidence that finds very high actual or potential return to some campaign contributions and wonders, if contributions buy influence, why more exchange does not occur. Other empirical work has found consistent long-term relationships of contributions from interest groups to politicians. Yet, models of <b>influence</b> <b>buying</b> have treated the exchange as a simple spot transaction. This paper develops a formal model of relational <b>influence</b> <b>buying</b> between a firm and a politician where campaign contributions are exchanged for policy favors in a self-enforcing contract. This contract provides several insights. First, not all favors that have positive joint surplus to the firm and politician are contractible. Second, the model predicts that horizons of politicians will reduce the ability to raise funds. Third, the model provides empirical predictions for when firms should lobby themselves or outsource and on the structure of legislation. The first can explain why more, apparently valuable, trade does not occur. I find evidence consistent with the horizon effects from US Congress people's age and term limits in US state legislatures. The third insight speaks both to potential regulatory implications and implications for managers' influence activities. Finally, the insights from the model suggest empirical tools to detect <b>influence</b> <b>buying</b> without directly observing the favors...|$|E
