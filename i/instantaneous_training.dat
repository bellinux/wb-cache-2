40|$|A {{universal}} freeway {{incident detection}} framework {{is a task}} that remains unfulfilled despite the promising approaches that have been recently explored. The need for an operationally successful incident detection and management system as a vital component of any advanced traffic management system, is well established and recognized. Only recently however, researchers and practitioners have begun to increasingly realize that for an incident detection framework to be universally operational and successful, it needs to fulfill all components {{of a set of}} recognized needs. It is the objective of this research to define those universality requirements and produce an incident detection framework that possesses the potential to fulfill them. A new potentially universal freeway incident detection framework has been proposed, developed and evaluated. The research effort was started by defining a comprehensive set of requirements that any universal incident detection algorithm or framework should fulfill. Among these requirements, an incident detection algorithm needs to be operationally accurate, automatically transferable, and capable of automatically adapting to changes in the freeway environment. This set of universality requirements was used as a template against which all algorithms within the scope of this study have been evaluated. Three major incident and loop detector databases were heavily utilized, two of which are unprecedented real databases collected from two major freeway sites in California and Minnesota, namely the Alameda County's I- 880 freeway database and the Minneapolis' I- 35 W database. The universality of the most well known existing incident detection algorithms was tested using the above databases. Serious lack of the universality, particularly transferability, was detected in all existing algorithms. Prior {{to the development of the}} new universal framework, limits on acceptable performance were elicited from TMC surveys conducted as part of this effort. Preliminary investigation of two promising advanced neural networks, namely the LOGICON and the PNN, was conducted. The PNN was more appealing due to its universality potential. The PNN was modified using a principal components transformation layer that resulted in performance enhancements. This together with its potential universality, led to the choice of the modified PNN for in-depth development. The in-depth development stage was divided into three phases. The first was the extraction of a new and improved input feature set that produced more distinct classes in the input feature space. The new features enhanced the transferability of the PNN and made the framework more compliant with the universality requirements. The second phase was the on-site real time retraining of the PNN after transferability, a phase that produced near optimal classification results and detection performance. The third phase was the development of a post processor output interpreter that linked the isolated 30 second outputs of the PNN and produced a sequentially updated probabilistic measure of existence of an incident in the field. The overall PNN-based framework was found to be fully compliant with the entire set of universality requirements. Finally, a new approach for training a multi-smoothing-parameter version of the PNN was investigated. The approach utilized genetic algorithms for optimizing the selection of the smoothing parameters. Obtained results indicated an improvement in performance over the single smoothing parameter PNN but at the expense of longer training time. The superiority and universality of a particular advanced neural network model, namely the PNN, was concluded in this research, as compared to the Logicon and the MLF neural networks, as well as existing conventional freeway incident detection algorithms. Adding the principal components transformation layer to the PNN was found to enhance its performance. Although the genetically optimized version of the PNN showed better transferability, both versions showed equally good performance after retraining. The PNN was concluded to be more practical for TMC implementation due to its <b>instantaneous</b> <b>training</b> capabilities...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the steady state response of a rigidly supported, granular layer to a moving load. Accordingly, the dynamic behaviour of a ballast layer under an <b>instantaneous</b> <b>train</b> axle passage is simulated, where the rigid support reflects a substratum {{that is much}} stiffer than the ballast layer, e. g. ballast in a concrete railway tunnel or on a concrete railway foundation. The discrete nature of the layer is captured via a 9 -cell square lattice. After deriving the equations of motion for the lattice, the long-wave approximation of the equations of motion is compared with the equations of motion for a continuum model. This leads to relations between the macroscopic constitutive parameters of the continuum and the microscopic constitutive parameters of the discrete lattice. Next, the boundary value problem is formulated and solved. The influence by the particle size, the damping characteristics and the load velocity on the layer response is demonstrated via a parametric study. Aerospace Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} {{procedure is}} {{developed in the}} present paper, allowing the prediction of the ballasted track profile degradation under railway traffic loading. In this procedure, an integration of the short-term and long-term mechanical processes of track deterioration is taken into account, using a track degradation model. This degradation model is incorporated into a finite element code where two modes of calculation are implemented: the ‘‘implicit mode’’ concerns the short-term track deterioration, in which the hypoplastic model {{is used for the}} ballast layer and the dynamic response to an <b>instantaneous</b> <b>train</b> axle passage is obtained to serve as input data for the ‘‘explicit mode’’, which concerns the simulation of long-term track deterioration, using the accumulation model for ballast layer. The whole procedure is illustrated on the prediction of the ballasted track profile degradation of a track section of 100 m. The results show a significant influence of the type of track geometry defects and the vehicle velocity on the evolution of track deterioration and the capability of the proposed procedure in reproducing the track profile degradation...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{one in a series}} of two, and {{discusses}} the body wave propagation and the eigenmodes for a layer of discrete particles. This configuration is a representation for a ballast layer used in ordinary railway tracks. The discrete nature of the ballast is simulated via an elastic nine-cell square lattice. After deriving the equations of motion for the lattice, the long-wave approximation for the equations of motion is compared with the equations of motion for a classic elastic continuum. This comparison yields relations between the macroscopic continuum parameters and the microscopic lattice parameters. Then, the dispersion curves that characterize the eigenmodes of the discrete layer are derived. The differences between these dispersion curves and those of a continuous layer are elucidated. By means of a parametric study, the influence is shown of the particle diameter and thickness of the layer on the dynamic response. In an accompanying paper, the layer response to a moving, harmonically vibrating load is analyzed, which is a representation for a ballast track that is subjected to an <b>instantaneous</b> <b>train</b> axle passage...|$|R
40|$|The {{steady state}} {{response}} of a discrete, granular layer to a uniformly moving, harmonically vibrating load is elaborated. This model simulates {{the response of}} a ballast layer to an <b>instantaneous</b> <b>train</b> axle passage. After deriving the boundary value problem and illuminating the corresponding solution procedure, a parametric study is carried out that considers cases that are relevant for railway practice. In the parametric study, {{the examination of the}} displacement pattern is combined with the analysis of the kinematic characteristics of the waves generated by the load. The latter analysis requires the derivation of an infinite number of so-called kinematic invariants. Accordingly, the emergence of typical 2 ̆ 2 discrete waves 2 ̆ 2 is demonstrated, which cannot be captured by a continuum model. The parametric study elucidates how the response is influenced by the particle size, the layer viscosity and the load frequency. In conclusion, the influence of the load velocity on the steady state response is studied, revealing the magnitudes of the critical velocities that characterise resonance of the layer vibrations...|$|R

According to the test results, the number of data packets sent by the communication module based on ZigBee technology is also the largest. Through several tests, the average packet loss rate of uplink and downlink of each communication module is calculated. According to the test results, when the communication module based on RFID technology is set to 250 [*]kbps at the air speed and the baud rate is 9600, the rate of packet loss in both uplink and downlink is the lowest. The packet loss rate of communication module based on ZigBee technology is relatively high. By adding the delay of the uplink and the delay of the downlink, the problem of two laptops’ time asynchrony can be eliminated and the more accurate round-trip delay of the packet transmission can be obtained.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAccurately {{determining}} {{the probability of}} various route choices is critical in understanding the actual spatiotemporal flow of commuters and the <b>instantaneous</b> capacity of <b>trains</b> and stations. Here, we report a novel procedure, {{based solely on the}} recorded tap-in tap-out ticketing data, that dictates the route choice of commuters in a rail transit system (RTS). We show that there exists a signature travel time distribution, in the form of Gumbel type 1 function, from a given origin O to a destination D. Any particular route can then be considered as a superposition of this mapping function and one can compute the probability that a specific path, over other possible paths, is taken by a commuter from O to D. The procedure is demonstrated by considering different scenarios using travel data from smart fare cards from Singapore's RTS; results show that the forecasted characteristic profile deviates by less than 10 − 5 from the actual distribution. We note that our method utilizes only two parameters that can be experimentally accounted for...|$|R
40|$|We study {{analytically}} and {{by means}} of an off-lattice bead-spring dynamic Monte Carlo simulation model the adsorption kinetics of a single macromolecule on a structureless flat substrate in the regime of strong physisorption. The underlying notion of a "stem-flower" polymer conformation, and the related mechanism of "zipping" during the adsorption process are shown to lead to a Fokker-Planck equation with reflecting boundary conditions for the time-dependent probability distribution function (PDF) of the number of adsorbed monomers. The theoretical treatment predicts that the mean fraction of adsorbed segments grows with time as a power law with a power of (1 +ν) ^- 1 where ν≈ 3 / 5 is the Flory exponent. The <b>instantaneous</b> distribution of <b>train</b> lengths is predicted to follow an exponential relationship. The corresponding PDFs for loops and tails are also derived. The complete solution for the time-dependent PDF of the number of adsorbed monomers is obtained numerically from the set of discrete coupled differential equations and shown to be in perfect agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation results. In addition to homopolymer adsorption, we study also regular multiblock copolymers and random copolymers, and demonstrate that their adsorption kinetics may be considered within the same theoretical model.

40|$|Acoustic metronomes {{and visual}} targets {{have been used}} in {{rehabilitation}} practice to improve pathological gait. In addition, they may be instrumental in evaluating and <b>training</b> <b>instantaneous</b> gait adjustments. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the efficacy of two cue types in inducing gait adjustments, viz. acoustic temporal cues in the form of metronome beeps and visual spatial cues in the form of projected stepping stones. Twenty healthy elderly (aged 63. 2  ±  3. 6  years) were recruited to walk on an instrumented treadmill at preferred speed and cadence, paced by either metronome beeps or projected stepping stones. Gait adaptations were induced using two manipulations: by perturbing the sequence of cues and by imposing switches from one cueing type to the other. Responses to these manipulations were quantified in terms of step-length and step-time adjustments, the percentage correction achieved over subsequent steps, and the number of steps required to restore the relation between gait and the beeps or stepping stones. The results showed that perturbations in a sequence of stepping stones were overcome faster than those in a sequence of metronome beeps. In switching trials, switching from metronome beeps to stepping stones was achieved faster than vice versa, indicating that gait was influenced more strongly by the stepping stones than the metronome beeps. Together these results revealed that, in healthy elderly, the stepping stones induced gait adjustments more effectively than did the metronome beeps. Potential implications for the use of metronome beeps and stepping stones in gait rehabilitation practice are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Computer work is {{associated}} with low level sustained activity in the trapezius muscle that may cause myalgia. The activity may be attention related or {{part of a general}} multijoint motor program providing stabilization of the shoulder girdle for precise finger manipulation. This study examines single motor unit (MU) firing pattern in the right trapezius muscle during fast movements of ipsi or contralateral index finger. Modulated firing rate would support a general multi joint motor program, while a generally increased and continuous firing rate would support attention related activation. 12 healthy female subjects were seated at a computer work place with elbows and forearms supported. Ten double clicks (DC) were performed with right and left index finger on a computer mouse instrumented with a trigger. Surface EMG was recorded from right and left trapezius muscle. Intramuscular EMG was recorded with a quadripolar wire electrode in the right trapezius. Surface EMG was analysed as %MVE. The intramuscular EMG was decomposed into individual MU action potential <b>trains.</b> <b>Instantaneous</b> firing rate (IFR) was calculated from inter-spike interval with ISI shorter than 20 ms defined as doublets. IFR was averaged across 10 DC to show IFR modulation. Surface EMG in both right and left trapezius was 1. 8 - 2. 5 %MVE. During right hand DC a total of 32 MUs were identified. Four subjects showed no activity. Four showed MU activity with weak or no variations related to the timing of DC. Four subjects showed large modulation in IFR with temporal relation to DC. During left hand DC 15 MUs were identified in 4 subjects, for two of the subjects with IFR modulations related to DC. Doublets was found as an integrated part of MU activation in the trapezius muscle and for one subject temporarily related to DC. In conclusion, DC with ipsi- and contralateral fast movements of the index finger was found to evoke biomechanically as well as attention related activity pattern in the trapezius...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: Cardiomyoplasty is a {{surgical}} procedure {{to support the}} failing heart, in which a burst-stimulated latissimus dorsi muscle flap is transposed and wrapped around the ventricles. The effect of dynamic cardiac compression, implemented as cardiomyoplasty, on left ventricular performance remains controversial; the mechanism by which clinical symptoms are improved remains unclear. To investigate the mechanism for improvement of patients' symptoms, {{it is important to}} evaluate the effects of cardiomyoplasty on left ventricular energetics and on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function. We therefore evaluated the efficiency of energy transfer from the native pressure-volume area to external work under conditions of 1 : 3 skeletal muscle burst pacing in an animal model with chronic heart failure. Methods: In seven Merino-Wether sheep, cardiomyoplasty was performed after stable heart failure was induced by staged coronary embolizations (ejection fraction < 35 %). Hemodynamic assessment including the assessment of the pressure-volume relationship was performed 8 weeks after cardiomyoplasty when the latissimus dorsi muscle was fully <b>trained.</b> <b>Instantaneous</b> left ventricular pressure and volume were measured with a catheter-tipped manometer and a conductance catheter during steady-state conditions and after a transient inferior vena cava occlusion. The effect of dynamic cardiac compression on left ventricular systolic function was assessed by comparing pre-assisted and assisted beats and on diastolic function by comparing assisted and post-assisted beats. Result: The slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship decreased by 30. 5 % ± 27. 8 % (p = 0. 02) during assisted beats. However, left ventricular pump performance improved by increasing stroke volume and external work by 35. 9 % ± 36. 0 % (p = 0. 03) and 9. 7 % ± 6. 8 % (p = 0. 03), respectively, resulting in a reduction of the volume intercept. As a result, the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship shifted to the left. The efficiency of energy transfer from the native pressure-volume area to the overall external work improved by 7. 6 % ± 8. 2 % (p = 0. 04). Cardiomyoplasty did not affect the time constant of left ventricular isovolumic pressure decline or the maximal rate of pressure decay, which suggested that cardiomyoplasty did not affect left ventricular relaxation. Conclusions: Dynamic cardiac compression in the form of cardiomyoplasty enhanced left ventricular pump performance without interrupting left ventricular filling. The ratio of energy transfer from the native pressure-volume area to the overall external work suggests a myocardial oxygen-sparing effect of cardiomyoplasty.
