To examine the influence of PCDD/Fs emissions from a MSWI on the surrounding environment, 21 soil samples were collected from various sampling sites distributed at distances of 300 - 1, 700 m away from the stack of a MSWI. <b>International</b> <b>Toxic</b> <b>Equivalent</b> (I-TEQ) concentrations ranged from 0. 47 to 2. 07 pg I-TEQ g(- 1), with average and median concentrations of 1. 08 and 1. 05 pg I-TEQ g(- 1), respectively. Comparison of the results presented herein with other worldwide studies suggested that the concentrations of PCDD/Fs in the ambient soil were relatively low, indicating a limited impact on the surrounding environment. The emission concentrations from the incinerator were the critical factor in generating an environmental impact on the surrounding environment. An exponential function was developed, indicating a slight decline in TEQs of PCDD/Fs with increasing distance from the MSWI stack. The ordinary kriging interpolation technique was selected to create a contour map, which intuitively showed that a limited surrounding area (a parts per thousand currency sign 1, 000 m from the stack) was obviously influenced by the MSWI...|$|E

In surface sediments, concentrations of both PCDD/DFs and coplanar-PCBs were higher in inland than in offshore samples. However, proportion of PCDFs in total PCDD/DFs was higher in inland than in the marine area samples, {{and it can be}} presumed that some combustion source might exist in inland acting as a source of PCDD/ DFs to this region. On the other hand, coplanar-PCBs were specifically high in particular locations of inland and marine area, indicating that scattered hotspots may be present both in inland and the marine areas. Various technical PCBs can be suspected as pollution sources depending on the isomer profiles of different commercial mixtures. In core sediment analysis, no temporal trend either in total concentration or isomer profile was observed. 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD, which was present in chemical defoliants, was not detected in any of the layers analyzed. 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD which is present in chemical defoliants might have diffused in the ocean or remain in deeper layers than in the depth of from which the sample for the present study was collected.

Most of the homologs reached an equilibrium of formation and degradation within 30 mm, except octachloronaphthalene which did not appear to reach such an equilibrium even after 240 mm. Chlorine substitution of the formed PCNs was identified and a similar pattern was found in chlorination products starting with naphthalene and chlorine. Furthermore, inorganic chlorine and unsubstituted naphthalene were found in the reaction products, confirming that the formation of naphthalene and the chlorination of that naphthalene could occur and could be suggested to be an important PCN formation route.

30|$|Grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) {{was clearly}} the most {{contaminated}} species. The mean PBDE concentration in grey seal was 115  ng/g fat, and the highest WHO-PCDD/F-PCB-TEQ (<b>toxic</b> <b>equivalent</b> set by WHO) was 327  pg/g fat. In Finnish, reindeer WHO-PCDD/F-TEQ varied from 0.92  pg/g fat in muscle to 90.8  pg/g fat in liver. WHO-PCDD/F-TEQ in moose liver samples was {{in the range of}} 0.7 – 4.26  pg/g fat, and WHO-PCB-TEQ in the range of 0.42 – 3.34  pg/g fat. Overall moose had clearly lower PCDD/F and DL-PCB concentrations in their liver than reindeer.|$|R
40|$|Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a yellow-coloured organic {{compound}} {{made up of}} five aromatic rings that contain only C and H atoms (Figure 1). It belongs to a family of compounds called polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and typically comprises about 5 to 7 % by weight of the total PAH content. BaP {{is widely regarded as}} the most carcinogenic of the non-substituted (parent) PAH compounds and is consequently used as a benchmark for <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalent</b> factors applied to concentrations of other PAH, the only other parent PAH ranked 1. 0 besides BaP is dibenz(a,h) anthracene...|$|R
40|$|Several {{temperate}} freshwater eel {{stocks have}} experienced unsustainable declines, {{yet to be}} explained. The decline of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in Lake Ontario {{has been linked to}} aryl-hydrocarbon receptor agonists such as polychlorinated dibenzo- p -dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs), and polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), and the question remains whether eels are affected similarly by these compounds. Concentrations of PCDD/Fs, dl-PCBs, and PCNs were determined in eels collected at seven locations in eastern Canada including L. Ontario, one location in New York, USA, and one location in Flanders, Belgium. Concentrations varied greatly among origins, indicating dissimilar historic loadings to local areas. The risk to eel reproduction was evaluated with 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalents,</b> and increased by 10 -fold from the least to most contaminated site. The risk to eel recruitment from dioxin-like compounds in American eel using available guidelines is low. The development of a more comprehensive model for eel recruitment risk assessment due to dioxin-like compounds, using eel-specific guidelines, is recommended. <b>Toxic</b> <b>equivalents</b> were 5 -fold higher when based on mammalian toxic equivalency factors compared to fish values. About half of the eels captured in L. Ontario exceeded the Canadian guideline for fish consumption (20  pg TEQ g - 1 ww), but there were no other exceedances in Canada. The current risk to eel consumers in Canada is low overall, except for highly urbanized and industrialized areas...|$|R

40|$|Over a 4 -year {{period from}} 1990 to 1993, the H 4 IIE {{bioassay}} {{was used to}} measure 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalent</b> concentrations (TECs) in the liver tissue of white sucker exposed to bleached kraft mill effluent. During two of the sampling periods, the H 4 IIE bioassay derived TECs (BD-TECs) were compared directly with BD-TECs measured by a similar bioassay using a rainbow trout liver cell line (RTL-W 1). From 1989 to 1993, chemistry-derived TECs (CD-TECs) were calculated directly from measured polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) and dibenzofuran (PCDF) concentrations in liver tissue. Chemistry-derived TECs were compared to bioassay-derived TECs using <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalent</b> factors (TEFs) developed for these systems. During the study period, the pulp mill began secondary treatment of effluent and increased the substitution of chlorine dioxide for molecular chlorine during bleaching. Significant reductions in H 4 IIE BD-TECs and CD-TECs were observed in liver tissue of both male and female white sucker during summer and fall sampling periods but not during spring sampling periods. Process and treatment improvements at this particular bleached kraft pulp mill appear to have been successful at reducing the levels of PCDDs and PCDFs found in white sucker exposed to the effluent. Despite the decreases in TECs, relative mixed function oxygenase (MFO) induction in the exposed white sucker did not decrease over the study period, suggesting the PCDDs and PCDFs are currently not the dominant MFO-inducing compounds in the effluent of this mill...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{case-control study}} was {{designed}} to determine the possible association between chronic exposure to dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and the occurrence of endometriosis. The study group consisted of 42 infertile endometriosis cases and 27 mechanical infertile controls, both groups attending one of the collaborating Centres for Reproductive Medicine, enrolled between 1996 - 1998. METHODS: Exposure assessment to dioxin-like compounds was determined through CALUX (chemical-activated luciferase gene expression) -bioassay to measure dioxin-like total <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalents</b> (dioxins and co-planar PCBs), whereas non-co-planar PCBs were determined through chemical analysis. RESULTS: No association was found between median dioxin-like total <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalents</b> (TEQ) and the occurrence of endometriosis in infertile women [cases (n = 34) : 29; controls (n = 27) : 24; NS]. When patients were subdivided based on an arbitrary cut-off value of 100 pg TEQ/g serum lipids, no statistically significant association between very high exposure to dioxin-like compounds and endometriosis was found [crude odds ratio (OR) = 4. 33; confidence interval (CI) 0. 49 - 38. 19; NS]. After adjusting for body mass index, and alcohol consumption, the risk increased slightly to OR = 4. 6 (CI 0. 48 - 43. 62; NS). There was no confounding by age, ovulatory dysfunction, caffeine intake, smoking or exposure to non-co-planar PCBs. CONCLUSIONS: The study results showed no statistically significant association between exposure to dioxin-like compounds and the occurrence of endometriosis in infertile women. status: publishe...|$|R

Tourism-related activities such as the heavy use of boats for transportation are {{a significant source of}} petroleum hydrocarbons that may harm the ecosystem of Langkawi Island. The contamination and toxicity levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) in the sediments of Langkawi were evaluated using sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) and <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalent</b> factors. Ten samples were collected from jetties and fish farms around the island in December 2010. A gas chromatography/flame ionization detector (GC/FID) was used to analyse the 18 PAHs. The concentration of total PAHs was found to range from 869 ± 00 to 1637 ± 20 ng g− 1 with a mean concentration of 1167. 00 ± 24 ng g− 1, lower than the SQG effects range-low (3442 ng g− 1). The results indicated that PAHs may not cause acute biological damage. Diagnostic ratios and principal component analysis suggested that the PAHs were likely to originate from pyrogenic and petrogenic sources. The <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalent</b> concentrations of the PAHs ranged from 76. 3 to 177 ng TEQ/g d. w., which is lower compared to similar studies. The results of mean effects range-median quotient of the PAHs were lower than 0. 1, which indicate an 11 % probability of toxicity effect.

40|$|Six pooled {{human milk}} samples were {{analysed}} for 50 individual PCB congeners, of which 24 {{were identified in}} all the samples. Mean total PCB (ΣPCB) concentrations were 10 ng/g of whole milk (equivalent {{to an average of}} 0. 39 μg/g lipid). The milk samples were pooled into groups to comprise rural, semi-rural and urban areas. However, no clear differences were observed between PCB concentrations or congener patterns between the different pooled samples. The contribution of individual PCDDs, PCDFs and mono-ortho- (mono-o) and di-o-substituted PCB congeners to the total calculated <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalent</b> values (ΣTEQ) in the UK population were determined based on results from the present study and data from Startin et al. (1989). Using the <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalent</b> factors (TEFs) proposed by Safe (1990) for PCBs and by the NATO/CCMS (1988) for PCDD/Fs, the TEQs calculated for the monitored PCBs made a greater contribution towards the ΣTEQs than PCDD/Fs. The main contributors to the ΣTEQ (data reported as TEQ in pg/g lipid) were the mono-o-substituted PCB congeners # 118 (17. 7), # 156 (15. 3) and # 105 (9. 95), 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 -P 5 CDF (11), 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 -P 5 CDD (6. 5), 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 -HxCDD/ 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 -HxCDD (6. 2) and 2, 3, 7, 8 -T 4 CDD (5. 6). Collectively these compounds accounted for 90 % of the ΣTEQ values...|$|R
