5|$|While in prison, Jack is {{contacted}} by Henry Turner, {{the son of}} Will and Elizabeth, to seek his aid in finding the Trident of Poseidon. Remembering Elizabeth and Will from his previous misadventures, Jack agrees but not before expressing some hesitation. The next day, Sparrow is sentenced to be executed by guillotine (by Jack's accidental choosing), but is rescued by Henry and his crew. Aided by aspiring astronomer Carina, Jack and Henry attempt to locate the Trident of Poseidon, as both {{are in need of}} its power to break curses related to the sea. Barbossa releases the Pearl from its bottle, giving them a chance to outrun Salazar. Jack and Barbossa discuss the fact that Carina is in truth Barbossa's long-lost daughter, whom he had left at an orphanage in order to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for a better life. Jack attempts to use the secret to blackmail Barbossa for his compass and 216 barrels of rum, but fails.|$|E
25|$|Helene came {{perilously close}} to being fired due to her failure to make any sales, along with suspicions by Sir Alan and his {{advisers}} (particularly Margaret) that she had consciously {{decided to take a}} backseat due to her having the least sales experience of the three members of Renaissance, but was saved by the fact that Sir Alan felt she {{had been one of the}} strongest candidates prior to her three-week losing run, and decided to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> in the interviews. The You're Fired panel, while agreeing with Michael's dismissal, felt that firing Helene would have also been justifiable.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) is {{notified}} by TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{that he has}} received a promotion as [...] "junior-in-charge-boy of the entire NBC page program" [...] but {{that he will have}} to move out to Los Angeles, which does not sit well with Kenneth. Kenneth tells Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) about this, but Tracy advises him to do a lousy job so that he loses the promotion. While giving a tour around the 30 Rock building, Kenneth does a terrible job, {{and as a result of}} his behavior, Pete is forced to dismiss him. At the same time, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) is shocked to see her boyfriend and Jenna impersonator, Paul (Will Forte), dressed as singer Cher. At Feyoncé (Susan Heyward) and Grizz Griswold's (Grizz Chapman) wedding, which is being held at the TGS set, Jenna is not amused that Paul showed up dressed as Cher, but is surprised that Paul is dressed as her on his left side and Cher on his right, and as a result, the two make-up. Later, at Grizz's wedding, Jack tells Liz that Carol is looking for her. Carol tells Liz that he would like to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> so that the two can have a relationship. At the same time, Kenneth, who is drunk, gets on stage, and gives a ranting speech to his former co-workers, ultimately telling them that he loves them all and hopes that they get everything they want in life.|$|E

500|$|Lawrence {{had not yet}} {{discovered}} that she was dying from liver cancer, and her weakened condition was exacerbated by the demands of her role. At the age of 52, she was required to wear dresses weighing [...] while walking or dancing a total of [...] during a 3½ hour performance eight times a week. Lawrence {{found it hard to}} bear the heat in the theatre during the summer months. Understudy Constance Carpenter began replacing her in matinee performances. Later in the year Lawrence's strength returned, and she resumed her full schedule, but by Christmas she was battling pleurisy and suffering from exhaustion. She entered the hospital for a full week of tests. Just nine months before her death, the cancer still was not detected. In February 1952, bronchitis felled her for another week, and her husband Richard Aldrich asked Rodgers and Hammerstein if they would consider closing the show for Easter week to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to recover fully. They denied his request, but agreed to replace her with the original Ado Annie from Oklahoma!, Celeste Holm, for six weeks during the summer. Meanwhile, Lawrence's performances were deteriorating, prompting audiences to become audibly restive. Rodgers and Hammerstein prepared a letter, never delivered, advising her that [...] "eight times a week you are losing the respect of 1,500people". In late August, Lawrence fainted following a matinee and was admitted to the NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital. She slipped into a coma and died on September 6, 1952, aged 54. Her autopsy revealed liver cancer. On the day of her funeral, the performance of The King and I was cancelled. The lights of Broadway and the West End were dimmed; she was buried in the ball gown she wore during Act 2.|$|E
2500|$|Faustina {{approached}} several convents in Warsaw, but {{was turned}} down every time, in one case being told that [...] "we do not accept maids here", referring to her poverty. Faustina could read and write and had {{three or four years}} of education. After several weeks of searching, the mother superior at the convent of Zgromadzenie Sióstr Matki Bożej Miłosierdzia (Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy) decided to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> and conditionally accepted her, provided that she could pay for her religious habit. Faustina knew nothing of the convent she was entering, except that she believed she was led there.|$|E
2500|$|Encouraged by her father, Bow {{continued}} to visit studio agencies asking for parts. [...] "But {{there was always}} something. I was too young, or too little, or too fat. Usually I was too fat." [...] Eventually, director Elmer Clifton needed a tomboy for his movie Down to the Sea in Ships, saw Bow in Motion Picture Classic magazine, and sent for her. In an attempt to overcome her youthful looks, Bow put her hair up and arrived in a dress she [...] "sneaked" [...] from her mother. Clifton said she was too old, but broke into laughter as the stammering Bow made him believe she was {{the girl in the}} magazine. Clifton decided to bring Bow with him and offered her $35 a week. Bow held out for $50 and Clifton agreed, but he could not say whether she would [...] "fit the part". Bow later learned that one of Brewsters' subeditors had urged Clifton to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Theodora was {{followed}} by two failures. In 1885, in homage to Victor Hugo, who had died a few months earlier, she staged one of his older plays, Marion Delorme, written in 1831, but the play was outdated and her role did not <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to show her talents. She next put on Hamlet, with her lover Philippe Garnier in the leading role and Bernhardt in the relatively minor role of Ophelia. The critics and audiences were not impressed, and the play was unsuccessful. Bernhardt had built up large expenses, which included a 10,000 francs a month allowance paid to her son Maurice, a passionate gambler. Bernhardt was forced to sell her chalet in Saint-Addresse and her mansion on rue Fortuny, and part of her collection of animals. Her impresario, Edouard Jarrett, immediately proposed she make another world tour, this time to Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chili, Peru, Panama, Cuba, and Mexico, then on to Texas, New York, England, Ireland, and Scotland. She was on tour for 15 months, from early 1886 until late 1887. On the eve of departure, she told a French reporter: [...] "I passionately love this life of adventures. I detest knowing in advance {{what they are going}} to serve at my dinner, and I detest a hundred thousand times more knowing what will happen to me, for better or worse. I adore the unexpected." ...|$|E

50|$|Ana Maria is {{comfortable}} with comedy, especially with works of Molliere, {{which is why}} she appeared in The ridiculous prices, Pantoja and the Special and Tartuffe.

5000|$|Actress Angelika dela Cruz was {{originally}} hesitant {{to accept the}} role of Lavinia, fearing {{that she would be}} typecasted in antagonist roles.

6000|$|... "Not when he supposes {{his wife}} to be fond of him--no. But I don't suppose that--I have given that up.
