40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} {{the importance of}} government corruption in shaping corporate finance patterns across countries. Corruption contributes to a more prevalent and higher degree of corporate equity ownership concentration and more reliance on bank financing in raising external finance. It argues that corporate governance under corrupt governments is particularly poor. Firm management, taking advantage of political capital acquired through bribery, is especially powerful in expropriating from outside <b>investors.</b> Ownership <b>concentration</b> and reliance on bank financing are means of mitigating the corporate governance problem under a corrupt government.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 In {{the first}} chapter I {{investigate}} {{the effect of the}} dispersion of institutional shareholders on firm value. By using mergers of institutional investors as exogenous changes to the ownership structure of firms in their portfolios I find that institutional investor monitoring is a complement to monitoring by other institutional <b>investors.</b> <b>Concentration</b> of institutional ownership is negatively related to firm value. The average cumulative abnormal return over an 11 -day window around the merger announcement is 69 basis points lower for firms that experience an increase in institutional ownership concentration than for firms whose ownership structure is unaffected. My findings are consistent with Edmans and Manso (2011) which shows that multiple small shareholders can be more effective monitors than few large shareholders. Besides shedding light on the relation between institutional ownership and firm value my results have implications on the use of institutional ownership variables in corporate governance research, in general. The second chapter is joint work with my co-authors Henrik Cronqvist and Stephan Siegel. We investigate the question of what explains variation across individuals in homeownership and home location choices. We address this question by decomposing the variation in individuals' choices into (i) a genetic factor, (ii) parental influence, and (iii) individual-specific environmental factors. We find that variation across individuals in their decisions to own or rent has a strong genetic component, while parental influence seems to not affect that choice once we control for socioeconomic characteristics. Furthermore, conditional on homeownership, the amount of housing individuals consume is also attributable to important genetic factors. Our findings contribute to {{a deeper understanding of the}} factors that explain individual behavior with respect to the housing market, and add to an expanding literature on the biological and genetic factors that influence individuals' economic and financial decisions...|$|R
40|$|Venture Investments in Israel – a Regional Perspective This paper {{analyzes}} the geographic distribution of venture investments in start-ups in Israel, using {{data for the}} period of 1995 - 2004. The findings show that their location behavior differs from that of high-tech activities: they show a pattern of "dispersed concentration" (as compared with a pattern of "concentrated concentration" of high-tech activity), with high levels of concentration in focal places, but at a commuting distance from the main metropolis. This is {{explained by the fact that}} venture investors also play the role of entrepreneurs and managers. The comparison between different types of venture investors shows that local venture capital funds lead to the heaviest concentration in the metropolis, in comparison with foreign venture <b>investors.</b> This heavy <b>concentration</b> of venture investments implies increasing regional gaps, with a minimal participation of peripheral regions, even those that enjoy some high-tech activity. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the value and}} corporate governance implications of stock liquidity by addressing two interrelated themes. Our first theme {{is to use the}} REIT industry as an experiment to demonstrate that stock liquidity has a material effect on improving firm value and corporate governance. Our second theme is to address the endogeneity problem in testing the empirical relation between stock liquidity and firm value. To address endogeneity concerns and identify the causal effect of stock liquidity on firm value and corporate governance, we use instrumental variables with decimalization as an exogenous shock to liquidity, difference-in-differences estimators, and the propensity score matching method. The result of the difference-in-differences test shows that stock liquidity has a significant causal impact on improving firm value. Equally important, we find that stock liquidity is conductive to better corporate governance through the channel of institutional ownerships. An increase in stock liquidity during decimalization leads to higher institutional participation in terms of equity ownerships by institutional investors, the number of institutional <b>investors,</b> and the <b>concentration</b> of institutional ownerships...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a sample}} of 49 {{countries}}, Rafael La Porta et al ((1997) 52 Journal of Finance 1131) showed that countries whose legal rules originate in the common-law tradition tend to protect investors considerably more than the countries whose legal rules originate in the civil-law, and especially the French civil-law, tradition, with the German civil-law countries and Scandinavian countries taking an intermediate stance toward <b>investor</b> protection. The <b>concentration</b> of ownership in La Porta et al's research is treated as an adaptive response to poor investor protection. In this article, we use evidence from China and other places {{to demonstrate that the}} political economy {{is more important than the}} legal origin in explaining the weak protection of minority shareholders in China's transitional economy. We argue that the concentration of state ownership in China's listed companies is a direct result of the government's political goal of controlling most of the listed companies. We further show that the political goal of maintaining control of most of the listed companies by the government weakens the protection of minority shareholders in China...|$|R
40|$|The Berle-Means problem - {{information}} and incentive asymmetries disrupting relations between knowledgeable managers and remote investors - {{has remained a}} durable issue engaging researchers since the 1930 's. However, the Berle-Means paradigm - widely-dispersed, helpless investors facing strong, entrenched managers - is under stress {{in the wake of}} the cross-country evidence presented by La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny and their legal approach to corporate control. This paper continues to investigate the roles of investor protections and concentrated ownership by examining firm behaviour in the Netherlands. Our within country analysis generates two key results. First, the role of investor protections emphasized in the legal approach is not sustained. Rather, we find that performance is enhanced when the firm is freed of equity market constraints, a result that we attribute to the relaxation of the myopia constraints imposed by relatively uninformed <b>investors.</b> Second, ownership <b>concentration</b> does not have a discernible impact on firm performance, which may reflect large shareholders' dual role in lowering the costs of managerial agency problems but raising the agency costs of expropriation. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} {{the impact of}} governance rules on share price and liquidity, using the turnover ratio and the bid-ask spread as proxies for the information asymmetry. We used a SEM model and analyzed the indirect relations through the voluntary disclosure of information and the organizational performance. We built a voluntary disclosure index {{based on the information}} firms provided in their annual reports and divided the governance characteristics in two constructs: directors’ and supervisors’ structures and ownership structure. We concluded that the ownership structure exerts a direct influence on share price and share liquidity, Otherwise, the directors’ and supervisors’ structures exert an indirect influence, through the organizational performance and the voluntary disclosure of information. The results also show that for firms with high levels of disclosure the bid-ask spread is lower. However, in firms with a high ownership <b>concentration</b> <b>investors</b> tend to increase the bid-ask spreads and trade less, which, in this case, reduces the liquidity of the stock. The failure to find the relationship between voluntary disclosure of information and the turnover ratio shows us that the liquidity of shares is more related to the greater or lesser concentration of shareholders, with the performance of their companies than with the access to information. Moreover, {{it is clear that the}} role that information disclosure plays is mainly at the level of price formation...|$|R
40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) Abstract: This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} corporate governance on the underpricing of Chinese initial public offers (IPO) for the years 2005 to 2007. Underpricing refers to the situation where the IPO share price jumps substantially higher {{on the first day}} of trading. Previous studies of Chinese IPO underpricing focus on one or two corporate governance mechanisms with a few controlled variables. This {{study examines}} six groups of corporate governance variables: ownership structure, the board, the CEO, the strategic <b>investor,</b> ownership <b>concentration</b> and the underwriter. The relationship between corporate governance variables and IPO underpricing is examined by the winner’s curse theory, the ex-ante uncertainty theory, the signaling theory and the underwriter’s reputation theory which have been developed from the asymmetric information theory. This study contributes to the literature by identifying from the extant literature and investigating the impact of six groups of corporate governance variables on IPO underpricing. By using multivariate regression analysis, this study performs sub-models and full models test under the sub-sample and full sample cases for determining the impact of corporate governance on Chinese IPO underpricing. The performance of proxy variables of the corporate governance variables are compared between sub-models and the full model. Considering the sub-models only, the findings reveal that four corporate governance variables including ownership, board, CEO and ownership concentration show their impacts on Chinese IPO underpricing under full sample and sub-sample cases. Considering the full model only, similar results are obtained. If one considers the sub-models and the full model together, the findings reveal state ownership induces higher IPO underpricing (Signaling hypothesis), board supervision induces lower IPO underpricing (Signaling hypothesis) and CEO-Chairman duality induces lower IPO underpricing (Asymmetric Information and signaling hypothesis) for the research period from 2005 to 2007. The impact of board supervision on Chinese IPO underpricing has been neglected in most previous studies. Nevertheless, the board supervision performed well in hypotheses tests in this study. It follows that the role of board supervision may be considered to be an important corporate governance parameter in any future research of Chinese IPO underpricing...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} model of {{portfolio}} choice to nest the views of Keynes - who advocates concentration in a few familiar assets - and Markowitz - who advocates diversification across assets. We rely on the concepts of ambiguity and ambiguity aversion to formalize {{the idea of an}} investor’s "familiarity" toward assets. The model shows that when an investor is equally ambiguous about all assets, then the optimal portfolio corresponds to Markowitz’s fully diversified portfolio. In contrast, when an investor exhibits different degrees of familiarity across assets, the optimal portfolio depends on (i) the relative degree of ambiguity across assets, and (ii) the standard deviation of the estimate of expected return on each asset. If the standard deviation of the expected return estimate and the difference between the ambiguity about familiar and unfamiliar assets are low, then the optimal portfolio is composed of a mix of both familiar and unfamiliar assets; moreover, an increase in correlation between assets causes an <b>investor</b> to increase <b>concentration</b> in the assets with which they are familiar (flight to familiarity). Alternatively, if the standard deviation of the expected return estimate and the difference between the ambiguity of familiar and unfamiliar assets are high, then the optimal portfolio contains only the familiar asset(s) as Keynes would have advocated. In the extreme case in which the ambiguity about all assets and the standard deviation of the estimated mean are high, then no risky asset is held (non-participation). The model also has empirically testable implications for trading behavior: in response to a change in idiosyncratic volatility, the Keynesian portfolio always exhibits more trading than the Markowitz portfolio, while the opposite is true for a change in systematic volatility. In the equilibrium version of the model with heterogeneous investors who are familiar with different assets, we find that the risk premium of stocks depends on both systematic and idiosyncratic volatility, and that the equity risk premium is significantly higher than in the standard model without ambiguity. ambiguity; diversification; investment; portfolio choice; robust control...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of three essays on how macroeconomic policy {{can be an important}} determinant of risk premium and how variations in risk premium may affect macroeconomic policy. Unconventional monetary policy represents a main example of how the transmission of macroeconomic policy is mediated by movements in risk premium. In the first essay, I examine how unconventional monetary policy affects asset prices by reallocating risk in the economy. I consider an environment with heterogeneity in risk tolerance and limited asset market participation. Risk-tolerant investors take leveraged positions, exposing the economy to balance sheet recessions. Limited asset market participation implies the balance sheet of the central bank is non-neutral. Unconventional monetary policy reduces the risk premium and endogenous volatility. During balance sheet recessions, asset purchases boost investment and growth. In contrast, during normal times, the expectation of future interventions reduces growth. Leveraged institutions respond to the policy by reducing risk-taking relatively more than risk-averse <b>investors.</b> As risk <b>concentration</b> falls, the probability of negative tail-events is reduced, enhancing financial stability. An important determinant of entrepreneurial activity in developing countries is the amount of risk the entrepreneur must bear. The second essay, joint with Robert M. Townsend, analyzes the risk-taking behavior of entrepreneurs. Using data from a survey conducted in villages in Thailand, we document substantial heterogeneity in entrepreneurial activity. The fraction of net worth invested by entrepreneurs in risky activities decreases over the life cycle. Consumption-to-wealth ratio is U-shaped, being high for young and old entrepreneurs. We propose a model that captures both the life cycle patterns and limited idiosyncratic insurance observed in the Thai data. An expansion in idiosyncratic insurance will reduce the idiosyncratic risk premium, increasing the proportion of wealth invested in risky activities and aggregate output. However, as the return on the project falls, entrepreneurs accumulate less wealth, reducing their welfare in the long-run. The third essay studies the optimal response of fiscal policy to a risk premium shock when a country is in a currency union. In the context of an open economy New Keynesian model, I show that the government should not deviate from the optimal provision of public goods at an attempt to stabilize the economy. A consumption tax is used to lean against the wind and reduce the real interest rate {{in the presence of a}} positive risk premium shock. A VAT tax allows the government to independently influence the terms of trade. Optimal fiscal policy has the property of being revenue-generating. Therefore, there is not necessarily a trade off between stabilization policy and fiscal consolidation. by Dejanir Henrique Silva. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|Tese de doutoramento em Gestão (Finanças), apresentada à Faculdade de Economia da Universidade de CoimbraThe {{practices}} of Corporate Governance, {{in relation to}} the optimization of the quality of information flows, allow to increase the company transparency and to assist shareholders in their portfolio decisions. One of the main roles of an effective disclosure policy is the reduction of the information asymmetries between managers – insiders – and general investors – outsiders. The information asymmetry results from the fact that managers have more and much better information, than the general investors, about the present situation and future perspectives of the company. Otherwise, the information asymmetry between administration and new shareholders can affect the investment decisions of the company because of the sub or under evaluation of the shares in the market. This study analyses the corporate governance determinants of voluntary disclosure {{and its impact on the}} reduction of information asymmetry. Our sample consists of Iberian Peninsula listed companies. We employed univariate and multivariate techniques for data analysis to study the direct and indirect relations between corporate governance characteristics, voluntary disclosure and information asymmetry proxies. We built a voluntary disclosure index based on the information firms provided in their annual reports and used the turnover ratio and the bid-ask spread as proxies for the information asymmetry in the market. We examined the association not only between the level of voluntary disclosure and the proxies for information asymmetry, but also their relation with ownership structure, directors’ and supervisors’ structures, applying the technique of structural equation modelling, path analysis, to test simultaneously for existing viii relationships among these variables. We examined whether corporate governance affects the level of information asymmetry in the capital market. We hypothesized that firms with effective corporate governance would be more likely to voluntarily disclose corporate information and that this would be associated with lower levels of information asymmetry. The results indicate that the main determinants of voluntary disclosure are the variables related with firm size, growth opportunities, organizational performance, board compensation and large shareholder ownership. The results also show that for firms with high levels of disclosure the bid-ask spread is lower. However, in firms with a high ownership <b>concentration</b> <b>investors</b> tend to increase the bid-ask spreads and trade less, which, in this case, reduces the liquidity of the stock. Our results corroborate some of the main theoretical foundations so far available concerning the relationship between corporate governance and voluntary disclosure, as well as the relationship between voluntary disclosure and information asymmetry. In addition, the results from the structural equation model allowed us to understand how the governance rules exert influence on the proxies of information asymmetry in the market. We concluded that the ownership structure exerts a direct influence on information asymmetry and that directors’ and supervisors’ structures exert an indirect influence, through the organizational performance and the voluntary disclosure of information...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines three distinctive {{issues that}} concern the regulators {{and policy makers}} {{in the development of}} financial markets. It contains three stand-alone research projects within the context of law, finance and economic growth. Chapter 2 examines the dynamic relationship between banks and economic growth from the points of view of market efficiency and asset pricing theory. Publicly traded banks are broadly representative of a country&# 146;s banking sector, so that banking industry stock prices will broadly reflect the performance of a country&# 146;s banking sector. Because previous research has established that the institutional framework, as well as the aggregate size, of the banking sector can significantly affect economic growth, this chapter investigates whether the stock returns on a country&# 146;s banking sector contain information about future economic growth, and whether the specific country and institutional characteristics that affect the functioning of the banking system and market efficiency also influence this relationship. Using the data from 18 developed and 18 emerging markets, the chapter finds a significant and positive relationship between bank excess return and future economic growth in both the time-series and panel analyses. The chapter also finds that this positive relationship is significantly strengthened by the enforcement of insider trading law, by banking crises, by bank disclosure regulations and financial development, but is weakened by government ownership of banks. Chapter 3 investigates the role of bank idiosyncratic volatility in economic growth and systemic banking crises. Using the same dataset from Chapter 2, this chapter finds an ambiguous relationship between bank volatility and economic growth in the time-series studies, which suggests that the effect of bank volatility on economic growth is more country-specific. In the panel analyses, the chapter finds a negative but very weak relationship between bank volatility and future economic growth. This negative relationship is magnified by banking crises and bank disclosure standards, but is alleviated by the government ownership of banks, the enforcement of insider trading law and financial development. The chapter goes further to examine whether bank volatility leads to the occurrence of systemic banking crises, and finds that the marginal effect of bank volatility on the probability of banking crises is very weak for the sample of all markets, and this result is mainly driven by the data from the emerging markets. However, bank volatility is a significant predictor of banking crises even after being controlled for macroeconomic indicators, which implies that market forces are more powerful in promoting the soundness of the banking system in developed markets. We also find that those macroeconomic and banking risk management indicators have different impacts on the probability of banking crises for the emerging and developed markets. Therefore, caution needs to be taken in interpreting the cross-country results of the studies on banking crises. Chapter 4 studies the corporate governance issues in China, a significant developing country that has been neglected by the current law and finance literature. Incorporated with the legal environment and ownership structure of China&# 146;s listed companies, the chapter develops a simple game model to study a neglected aspect of current corporate governance literature: the expropriation arising from the mixture of weak <b>investor</b> protection, ownership <b>concentration</b> coexisting with ownership dispersion, and the absence of a controlling shareholder. The last two chapters find that government ownership undermines the positive link between bank excess return and economic growth, but alleviates the negative impact of bank volatility on growth as well. This chapter shows that government ownership is also a two-edged sword in corporate governance in China: it leads to a double-agency problem; however, the strong legal protection of State assets also increases the cost of expropriation. Using the data from 1996 to 2003, the chapter finds the empirical evidence consistent with the model. By analysing the puzzles in China&# 146;s stock market, the chapter suggests that improving the legal protection of investors is the key issue in the future development of the financial market...|$|R
