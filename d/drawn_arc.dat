50|$|A <b>drawn</b> <b>arc</b> can be {{initiated}} by two electrodes initially in contact and drawn apart; this can initiate an arc without the high-voltage glow discharge. This {{is the way}} a welder starts to weld a joint, momentarily touching the welding electrode against the workpiece then withdrawing it till a stable arc is formed. Another example is separation of electrical contacts in switches, relays or circuit breakers; in high-energy circuits arc suppression {{may be required to}} prevent damage to contacts.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{influence}} of two selected parameters (the welding time {{and the presence of}} the activating flux {{on the surface of the}} base metal) on the weld joint at Stud Arc Welding process is investigated. In the experimental part of the paper, the <b>drawn</b> <b>arc</b> stud welding process with the ceramic ferrule is applied with the different welding time and the application of the activating flux for ATIG process. In order to evaluate {{the influence}} of the welding time and the activating flux on the weld characteristics, the cast zone width and Vickers hardness HV 0. 2 are measured...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{influence}} of the activating flux on the weld joint properties at the <b>drawn</b> <b>arc</b> stud welding process with ceramic ferrule is analysed. In the experimental part of the paper, the arc stud welding process is applied with the application of the activating flux for ATIG process. In order to evaluate {{the influence}} of the activating flux on the welding process parameters variations, the main welding parameters were monitored by an on-line monitoring system. Besides monitoring of welding current and voltage, {{the influence of}} the activating flux on the weld joint appearance is investigated. The macrosections of the weld joints welded with the same parameters, but with and without the presence of activating flux are shown...|$|E
40|$|Detailed arc erosion {{studies are}} {{conducted}} on AgSnO/sub 2 / contact materials for an opening operation at 42 V and 24 A. A novel experimental arrangement is developed {{to terminate the}} arc current at predetermined voltage levels as the arc is drawn between contacts opening at a constant velocity. Contact samples are studied terminating the arc current at fifteen different points as the arc is drawn between the contacts. Surface profiling of samples is conducted determining the extent of erosion at different points into the <b>drawn</b> <b>arc.</b> Spectral analysis is also conducted on the arc and related to the erosion. The results show that different features occur at particular stages as the arc is drawn. In the initial stages, the erosion data indicate that the arc root is small and immobile on both anode and cathode. Material movement is mainly anode to cathode. The spectral analysis indicates that Sn and O species dominate the arc followed by the Ag species. In the later stages, the anode has a significantly larger eroded area than the cathode. The erosion data indicate multiple arc roots. The spectral analysis indicates that Ag and N species dominate. Mechanisms of erosion are discussed and related to these species...|$|E
40|$|For the {{dismantling}} of austenitic components of nuclear facilities fastening techniques, usable remote controlled under water, are investigated. The components are only one-sided accessable. The fastening techniques are based on <b>Drawn</b> <b>Arc</b> Stud Welding, Mechanical Drilling followed by mechanical clamping of the fastening elements and thermal drilling with Contact Arc Metal Cutting (CAMC) followed by mechanical clamping of the fastening elements. In thermal drilling process with CAMC hollow electrodes of different materials with internal water scavenging are investigated with regard to wear behaviour and removal rate. The graphite type EG 88 shows the longest electrode life, tested in plates of thickness from 20 mm up to 65 mm and using dielectric fluid both drinking water and deionized water. 14 holes were drilled in a plate of a thickness of 30 mm (adequate to 420 mm) without electrode-changing, in this time the wear on the length 16, 9 mm. Minor tapered holes and rough interior surfaces of the pearcing holes are the results. Fastening elements plug and blind rivet, which are customary in trade, have been investigated. The latter guarantees the necessary mould clamp. The selected blind rivet is usable for plate-thicknesses from 6 mm up to 42 mm. In tensile test the rivet pin breaks from 78 kN upwards. The rivet case is formed in minor tapered holes {{in the same way}} as in rough interior surfaces of holes. Drill bur does not influence the results. The developed combined one-way fastening elements and repeatedly applicable fastening elements are able to pierce (CAMC), to interlock and also to fix and to transport the segments of the components without changing end effector of the manipulator. Such a general ideal process is demonstrated in 1 : 1 experiment. The developed fastening technologies are usable at least up to a water depth of 20 m.

30|$|Rhino {{provides}} more than 30 different ways for users to draw various lines (e.g., line <b>drawing,</b> curve <b>drawing,</b> <b>arc</b> <b>drawing).</b> Due to its various methods of drawing, Rhino tools {{have more than}} 2000 functions, which make almost impossible to handle all of the tools during the class activities of one semester. Therefore, its most important and common functions during the 3 D modeling process were introduced in the classes (e.g., drawing lines and extruding them, revolving lines to make a surface, cutting surfaces and transforming them, copying them in symmetrical directions as a mirror function, arranging them). This practice was performed for the 4  weeks of the total 16 -week class period.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{technique}} to visualize de-pendencies among cells in a spreadsheet. In this way, the system firstly visualizes a spreadsheet on a plane in three-dimensional space, and <b>draws</b> <b>arcs</b> between interrelated cells. By allowing a user to select an arbitrary cell and lift it up with direct manipulation, the system utilizes the third dimension to ameliorate visual occlusion of crossing arcs. As the user lifts a focused cell up, the interrelated cells are lifted up together; thus hidden dataflow networks can be vi-sually intelligible interactively. Because spreadsheets are aimed at calculation itself rather than appearances of out-puts, their mechanism is relatively invisible and not obvious for ordinary users. Our visualization helps such users to understand structures and mechanism of spreadsheets...|$|R
