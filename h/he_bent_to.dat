500|$|The name {{tantalum}} {{was derived}} from the name of the mythological Tantalus, the father of Niobe in Greek mythology. In the story, he had been punished after death by being condemned to stand knee-deep in water with perfect fruit growing above his head, both of which eternally tantalized him. (If <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> drink the water, it drained below the level he could reach, and if he reached for the fruit, the branches moved out of his grasp.) Ekeberg wrote [...] "This metal I call tantalum ... partly in allusion to its incapacity, when immersed in acid, to absorb any and be saturated." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> {{give her}} tender greeting, but Sylvia arrested him.|$|E
60|$|Captain Brisket {{thanked him}} and, sucking the pencil, eyed him thoughtfully. Then <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> {{the table and}} wrote.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> over <b>to</b> {{read her}} face, {{uncertain}} {{in the dim}} twilight.|$|R
60|$|They stood {{facing each}} other. The dog {{walked away from}} her <b>to</b> him. <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> down <b>to</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|She groaned {{behind the}} unclean ruins of his upper garment. She mumbled something. <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> lower <b>to</b> hear. She was saying-- ...|$|R
60|$|With a weary {{sound that}} was not a sigh, nor a groan, <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> work again, until the silence was again broken.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were worried}} about your mail," [...] he answered, briefly, as he {{delivered}} it. Then <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> examine the fetlocks of his weary horse.|$|E
60|$|In {{the slight}} scuffle which ensued {{one of the}} men unintentionally jostled the German. His pipe fell to the ground. <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> recover it.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> forward <b>to</b> kiss them, {{for they}} peeped out through her torn stockings, and bore pathetic witness to her {{endurance}} and devotion.|$|R
60|$|Blair {{had left}} {{courtesy}} and endurance in France, as was evinced {{by the way}} <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> closer <b>to</b> Helen, to speak low, with terrible passion.|$|R
60|$|Neale {{threw the}} {{cards in the}} man's face; then, rising, <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> over <b>to</b> slap him so violently as to knock him off his chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some nigger-chaser, that pup, some nigger-chaser!" [...] Van Horn {{confided to}} Borckman, as <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> pat Jerry {{and give him}} due reward of praise.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> his oars, {{and made}} the boat move through the water at a very {{different}} rate to that at which she had before traveled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is that so, {{or is it}} one of your father's judgments?" [...] Harvey asked, as <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> his oars. He felt he was {{learning}} to handle them more easily.|$|E
60|$|He had by {{this time}} {{cautiously}} unfolded the wet letter; but, as <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> himself <b>to</b> decipher the writing, a cloud descended on his brow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait a minute, Frank, till I tighten my skate strap," [...] cried Fred Rover, as <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> down <b>to</b> {{adjust the}} {{loosened}} bit of leather.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you make}} of it?" [...] asked Paul, impatiently, as <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> over <b>to</b> examine the object as it lay in his younger brother's palm.|$|R
60|$|His fingers strayed {{along her}} fingers on the {{keyboard}} as <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> her, first kissing her hair, then slowly turning her face up to his and kissing her willing lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "It had its grandeur. They went {{to their}} death like men. They have taught me a lesson. Hitherto I have drifted--henceforth I sail!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> her with a mystical smile.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Benn's {{breathing}} as <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> {{his task}} again was distinctly audible. The head of Mr. Travers ranged itself once more alongside the widow's. For {{a long time}} they watched in silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't seen them," [...] {{answered}} Roger. <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> down <b>to</b> get {{out his own}} foot coverings. [...] "Hello, {{my shoes}} are gone, too!" [...] he cried.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me look," [...] Tance the {{archeologist}} said. <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> down <b>to</b> look, squinting. [...] "Good Lord!" [...] He leaped violently back, knocking against Dorle, the Chief Navigator.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't mind that,' he said, with a smile, 'though I am glad {{there is}} one lady who does not scold me;' and <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> down <b>to</b> kiss her.|$|R
6000|$|He {{pointed to}} {{three of the}} bamboo poles erect and devil-dancing in token that fish were hooked and {{struggling}} on the lines beneath. As <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> his paddle, he muttered, for my benefit: ...|$|E
60|$|Onions of {{his breath}} {{came across the}} counter out of his ruined mouth. <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned {{waistcoat}} and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.|$|E
6000|$|... "So do I!" [...] and Captain John {{laughed a}} queer, happy laugh, as <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> his oars again, with {{the look of}} a man who knew where he was going and longed to get there as soon as possible.|$|E
60|$|Lewis grunted as <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> over <b>to</b> lift a red coal {{to light}} his pipe, {{and as he}} raised his head he gave Wade a glance of {{sympathetic}} curiosity.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> down <b>to</b> {{stare at}} Schomberg who sat unstirring with stony eyes and set features, and {{apparently}} deaf to the rasping derision of that laughter {{so close to}} his red fleshy ear.|$|R
60|$|Then Joan {{released}} her clasp {{and gave up}} to utter defeat. Cleve was silent. He {{did not seem to}} hear the shuddering little sobs that shook her. Suddenly <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> close <b>to</b> her.|$|R
60|$|And instantly, {{as if by}} some divine insight, he knew {{himself in}} the remaking--tried, found wanting; but stronger, better, surer--and he wheeled to Jane Withersteen, eager, joyous, passionate, wild, exalted. <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> her; he left tears and kisses on her hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nice {{little thing}} she is too," [...] said the waterman, {{watching}} the other {{out of the}} corner of his eye as <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> his oars. [...] "Rides the water like a duck. Her cap’n knows a thing or two, I’ll bet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please {{choose to}} learn, Meg. I love to teach, {{and this is}} easier than German," [...] broke in John, getting {{possession}} of the other hand, so {{that she had no}} way of hiding her face as <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> look into it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{if we are}} lucky," [...] he said grimly, as <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> himself <b>to</b> the work. [...] "But the {{question}} is where to paddle to--it's so dark. Had not we better run for the shore?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> down <b>to</b> rake the fire. He {{had a long}} {{back like}} the long back of a tramhorse. He shook the poker gravely and nodded {{his head at the}} fellow out of third of grammar.|$|R
60|$|The oarsman delayed only {{long enough}} to gaze in the {{direction}} indicated, where he saw the old fakir whom they had met with such great loss at Waterville, and then <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> himself <b>to</b> the task.|$|R
