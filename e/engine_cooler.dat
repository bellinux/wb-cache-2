5000|$|For open {{throttle}} operation {{a richer}} mixture will produce more power, prevent pre-ignition detonation, {{and keep the}} <b>engine</b> <b>cooler.</b> This is usually addressed with a spring-loaded [...] "power valve", which is held shut by engine vacuum. As the throttle opens up, the vacuum decreases and the spring opens the valve to let more fuel into the main circuit. On two-stroke engines, {{the operation of the}} power valve is the reverse of normal — it is normally [...] "on" [...] and at a set rpm it is turned [...] "off". It is activated at high rpm to extend the engine's rev range, capitalizing on a two-stroke's tendency to rev higher momentarily when the mixture is lean.|$|E
5000|$|... 32 lead changes {{occurred}} between eight drivers within {{the course of}} this race. Buddy Baker, Hamilton, Isaac, David Pearson, Cale Yarborough, Richard Brickhouse, Charlie Glotzbach and Bobby Allison all had their opportunities to dominate the race. Even though Baker led the most laps with 101 (along with having a nine-second distance between Pete Hamilton by lap 170), he spent 88 minutes on pit road allowing Hamilton to lap him. Baker began to close in on Hamilton. However, Baker's tire blew heading into the fourth turn on lap 175; fragments of the tire would ultimately damage the <b>engine</b> <b>cooler</b> that would result in a serious fire for his Dodge vehicle. Baker proceeded to attempt to put out the fire by spinning into the grass apron, as the area appeared to have the least amount of possible impact on other cars.|$|E

40|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>cooling</b> {{and thermal}} {{management}} system is very essential in an automotive industry. It has been existed for decades but only recently been explored for revolution. This study explores current conventional <b>engine</b> <b>cooling,</b> specifically detailing out specifications for wax type conventional thermostat and engine driven water pump. In conventional cooling study, improvement {{has been made}} on thermostat opening temperature. Actual experimental set up has been installed and result recorded. Impact on this change has been studied in term of engine coolant inlet and outlet temperature, radiator, bypass flow rate and also Euro 3 emission compliance. This study also highlights the limitation of current conventional <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> and thermal management system, thus requiring revolution to the system. Advanced <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> and thermal management system is then explored as a revolution of <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> and thermal management system. This further brings us to study on electrification of <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> components mainly on electric control valve and electric water pump. The control system is also improved through integration between <b>engine</b> input/output and <b>cooling</b> input /output for optimum combination. 2 case studies have been reviewed which are Chevrolet Tahoe, 5. 77 litre (Chalgren Jr, 2004) and Ford Excursion 6. 0 liter diesel (Chalgren and Allen, 2005). In these two studies, electric water pump, electric valve, dual variable speed fan and also restrictor at bypass to boost heater core coolant flow have been fully examined and effect on <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> and thermal management system is observed. A lot of improvement seen from this revolution namely improvement in fuel consumption, reduced warm up time, better emission control, better cabin temperature during cold start, better coolant temperature fluctuation and also reduction in parasitic loss. ...|$|R

40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines (ICEs) {{are widely used}} as independent power producers due to their high electrical efficiency (up to 47 %), which can be further enhanced by operating them in combined cycle mode with a water/steam cycle as bottoming cycle. This study presents an integrated approach to optimize the combined cycle overall system efficiency. Therefore, not only the most favorable design of the waste heat recovery (WHR) cycle, but also the optimal configuration of the ICE cooling system have to be investigated, in order to integrate both available engine waste heat sources (exhaust gas, 300 - 400 °C, <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> water, 90 °C) into the waste heat recovery cycle. For {{the definition of the}} most favourable temperature level of the <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> water three variants of <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> systems are examined, with respect to technical limitations given by the ICE. In order to determine the types of engines for which this optimization approach is suitable, three types of engines with different characteristics (fuel, exhaust gas parameters) combined with a water/steam cycle are simulated, by using the calculation tools Excel and Ebsilon Professional. An energetic, exergetic and economic analysis is conducted. These reveal the impacts of the temperature level to the WHR system and to the design of the <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> system. The calculations performed, showed that up to 19 % of the <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> water heat can be efficiently recovered compared to a portion of 6 % in the standard system. The better recovery leads to a 5 %-decrease in the costs of electricity generation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
