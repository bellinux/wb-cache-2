Følling obtained urine samples <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> and, after many tests, {{he found that the}} substance causing the odor in the urine was phenylpyruvic acid. The children, he concluded, had excess phenylpyruvic acid in the urine, the condition which came to be called phenylketonuria (PKU).|$|E

The Red Brigades had also infiltrated the Italian institutions and obtained information <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> of politicians who were members of left and far-left organizations. With the help of the Vatican intelligence, which he considered superior to the Italian one, he investigated such infiltrations, but no measures were taken.|$|E
25|$|The total {{population}} of the Huron {{at the time of}} European contact has been estimated at about 20,000 to 40,000 people. From 1634 to 1640, the Huron were devastated by Eurasian infectious diseases, such as measles and smallpox, to which they had no immunity. Epidemiological studies have shown that beginning in 1634, more European children immigrated with their families to the New World from cities in France, England, and the Netherlands, which had endemic smallpox. Historians believe the disease spread <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> to the Huron and other nations. Many Huron villages and areas were abandoned. About half to two-thirds of the population died in the epidemics, decreasing the population to about 12,000.|$|E
25|$|Trick-or-treating {{typically}} happens between 5:30pm and 9:30pm on October 31, {{although some}} municipalities choose other dates. Homeowners wishing {{to participate in}} it sometimes decorate their private entrances with artificial spider webs, plastic skeletons and jack-o-lanterns. Some rather reluctant homeowners would simply leave the candy in bowls on the porch, others might be more participative and would even ask an effort <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> {{in order to provide}} them with candy. In more recent years, however, the practice has spread to almost any house within a neighbourhood being visited by children, including senior residences and condominiums. Although people decorate their homes for Halloween, when homes would like to participate in handing out candy, a porch light is usually left on to signify that a home is handing out candy.|$|E

25|$|Efforts {{aimed at}} the {{improvement}} of the relations between blacks and Jews in Crown Heights began almost immediately following the rioting. Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden summoned the leaders of each of the ethnic communities to Borough Hall within days after the riots ended, creating {{what became known as the}} Crown Heights Coalition. The Coalition, led by Edison O. Jackson, the then President of Medgar Evers College and Rabbi Shea Hecht, Chairman of the Board of the National Committee for Furtherance of Jewish Education (NCFJE), functioned for ten years as an inter-group forum in which to air neighborhood concerns and work out issues. Golden used the Coalition to initiate interracial projects designed to promote dialogue. One project involved sending a Jewish leader and a Black leader together in a pair to public intermediate and high schools in the area to answer questions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> about each other's cultures.|$|E
25|$|The Hawaiians’ ways of {{learning}} include wide keen attention <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> while adults {{are available for}} guidance, {{also found in the}} model of Learning by Observing and Pitching In. Children were found to learn from adults by participating in group activities where they had the chance to observe the performance of more experienced participants as well as having errors in their own performance corrected by more seasoned group members. Because the children learn through observation, and then are encouraged to practice among their peers, we can speculate the children have keen attention to events around them, which is an expectation of adults and community members who are there to assist when needed. It has been observed that Hawaiian children were successful at completing tasks which greatly depend on visual and memory process skills, which coincides with Hawaiian mother’s frequent use of non-verbal communication.|$|E
25|$|In {{the issues}} of Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps serving as preludes to the Blackest Night event, the Star Sapphires {{continue}} to make preparations for the predicted conflict. After undergoing treatment within a violet conversion crystal, Fatality emerges as a newly transformed Star Sapphire. Her first thoughts upon being released are to seek out John Stewart (a Green Lantern she'd been trying to kill for causing the destruction of her home planet). Upon finding him, however, she saves him from Agent Orange's attacking Orange Lantern constructs, demonstrating that {{they are unable to}} absorb constructs made from violet light. She admits that revenge is no longer her goal, and that she has other plans. In the following issue, she reveals that she's attracted to Stewart, may have always been, and the Star Sapphire has given her the ability to finally absolve herself of her survivor's guilt. After Fatality's successful conversion, Miri and Queen Aga'po observe that Kryb appears to be crying inside of her crystal (seemingly distraught over being separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> she kept imprisoned on her back). Queen Aga'po remarks that it is a sign the treatment is working.|$|E

25|$|Psychoanalysts {{diagnose}} uncertainty as {{the dominant}} attitude {{to life in the}} postmodern society. This uncertainty can be caused by the pressure which is executed from the society to the humans. It is the uncertainty to fail, but also the fear of their own limits, not to achieve something what the society expects, and especially the desire for recognition in all areas of life. In today's society we are in a permanent competition. Appearance, occupation, education of the children - everything is compared to a media staged ideal. Everything should be perfect, because this deep-rooted aversion to all average, the pathological pursuit to excellence - these are old traditions. Who ever wants more - on the job, from the partner, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>children,</b> from themselves - will one day be burned out and empty inside. He is then faced with the realization that perfection does not exist. Who is nowadays empty inside and burned out, is in the common language a Burnout. But due to the definitional problems Burnout is till this date not a recognized illness. An attempt to define this concept more closely, can be: a condition that gets only the passionate, that is certainly not a mental illness but only a grave exhaustion (but can lead to numerous sick days). It can benefit the term that it is a disease model which is socially acceptable and also, to some extent, the individual self-esteem stabilizing. This finding in turn facilitates many undetected depressed people, the way to a qualified treatment. According to experts in the field, in addition to the ultra hard-working and the idealists mainly the perfectionist, the loner, the grim and the thin-skinned are especially endangered of a burnout. All together they usually have a lack of a healthy distance to work.|$|E

In 2009, Perks was repeatedly challenged for descriptions of masturbation, sexually explicit conduct, drug use, and talk of suicide and there have been multiple pushes across the United States to move this literary work <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> and young adults section to the adult section. Parents have raised issues with the novel for it's [...] "pornographic" [...] content and [...] "vulgarity", but others have argued that the book deals with real and common teen issues concerned with growing up, so it presents a truthful viewpoint. Issues are also raised surrounding the books themes of homosexuality, as well as a [...] "glorification" [...] of the use of drugs and alcohol.|$|E
