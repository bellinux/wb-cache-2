[...] De Pablo stated [...] "I’ve had 8 great years with NCIS and Ziva David. I have huge respect and affection for Mark, Gary, Michael, David, Rocky, Pauley, Brian, Sean, all of the team and CBS. I look forward to finishing Ziva’s story." [...] However it {{was announced}} that Cote De Pablo would return for the beginning of season 11 to wrap up Ziva's storyline. [...] Show runner Gary Glasberg stated in an interview with EW that: [...] "The amazing resolution you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> pretty damn heart-wrenching and we're incredibly proud of it," [...] he writes. [...] "Prepare yourselves for a moment in television history. Images that will end up in the archives.

GRI disputed the notion that its technology could be the threat to privacy it is in the film. [...] "Minority Report is one possible outcome," [...] a corporate official told Fast Company. [...] "I don't think that's our company's aim, but I think what we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> an environment well beyond what you see in that movie--minus the precogs, of course."

[...] Jurgens added that each writer will concentrate on certain characters, saying [...] "They'll encounter each from time to time, and then we start to work that wider scope thing, and then pull back and let them have their own adventures for a bit." [...] Later in the month, Newsarama commented on the styling of the title as Futures End opposed to Future's End, speculating that the series may affect multiple futures seen in The New 52 since its launch. DC co-publisher Dan DiDio responded to this by saying, [...] "what you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> the potential of where the futures can be going" [...] as well as the [...] "direct impact it has on stories set in the current timeline in the DCU."

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} CAT {{generation}} algorithm for Dyck paths with a fixed length n. It is the formalization of a method for the exhaustive generation {{of this kind of}} paths which can be described by means of two equivalent strategies. The former is described by a rooted tree, the latter lists the paths by means of three operations which, as we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> <b>are</b> equivalent <b>to</b> visit the tree. These constructions are strictly connected with ECO method and can be encoded by a rule, very similar to the succession rule in ECO, with a finite number of labels for each n. Moreover with a slight variation this method can be generalized to other combinatorial classes like Grand Dyck or Motzkin paths. Comment: 19 figure...|$|R
