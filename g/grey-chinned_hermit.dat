50|$|The <b>grey-chinned</b> <b>hermit</b> (Phaethornis griseogularis) is {{a species}} of hummingbird in the Trochilidae family. It is found in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, and - {{marginally}} - far northern Brazil. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, and heavily degraded former forest.|$|E
50|$|The stripe-throated hermit has, {{together}} {{with several other}} small hermits, often been considered a subspecies of the little hermit (P. longuemareus), but morphological data suggest it may {{be closer to the}} <b>grey-chinned</b> <b>hermit</b> (P. griseolaris). At present most, if not all, major authorities accept the split (SACC, the Clements check list, the Howard & Moore check list, etc.). It has been suggested that the mainly Central American taxon saturatus, which typically is considered a subspecies of P. striigularis, may deserve species status, in which case it would become the dusky hermit or Boucard's hermit (P. saturatus). The taxon adolphi is considered a junior synonym of saturatus by most authorities.|$|E
