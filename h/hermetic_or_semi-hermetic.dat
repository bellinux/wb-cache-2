If the MEMS is fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer, the buried oxide of the SOI wafer acts as an etch stop for the etching. A sacrificial layer(s) is accessed and removed from {{the back side of the}} wafer, while the front side of the wafer is protected by a masking layer.

40|$|We {{present the}} first all-Parylene {{microbubble}} pressure transducer (μBPT). The μBPT utilizes an electrolytically generated microbubble (μB), {{trapped in a}} Parylene microchamber, for pressure sensing. Pressure-induced bubble size variation is detected by electrochemical impedance measurement. Real-time hydrostatic pressure measurement with excellent sensitivity (- 10. 7 Ω/psi, ± 0. 1 psi) up to 1. 8 psi and tracking of internal pump pressure in a MEMS-based implantable drug delivery system were achieved. The transduction method and device format uniquely leverage the surrounding liquid environment, obviating the need for <b>hermetic</b> <b>or</b> special packaging techniques for sensing in wet environments. Arrayed μBPTs are biocompatible, fabricated on flexible substrates, ultra-miniature (200 μm diameter, 10 μm thick), and can be operated at very low power (≤ nW) making them especially attractive for in vivo pressure measurement applications...|$|R

40|$|Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) {{have been}} heralded {{for their ability}} to provide {{tremendous}} advantages in electronic systems through increased electrical performance, reduced power consumption, and higher levels of device integration with a reduction of board real estate. RF MEMS switch technology offers advantages such as low insertion loss (0. 1 - 0. 5 dB), wide bandwidth (1 GHz- 100 GHz), and compatibility with many different process technologies (quartz, high resistivity Si, GaAs) which can replace the use of traditional electronic switches, such as GaAs FETS and PIN Diodes, in microwave systems for low signal power (x < 500 mW) applications. Although the electrical characteristics of RF MEMS switches far surpass any existing technologies, the unknown reliability, {{due to the lack of}} information concerning failure modes and mechanisms inherent to MEMS devices, create an obstacle to insertion of MEMS technology into high reliability applications. All MEMS devices are sensitive to moisture and contaminants, issues easily resolved by <b>hermetic</b> <b>or</b> near-hermetic packaging. Two well-known failure modes of RF MEMS switches are charging in the dielectric layer of capacitive membrane switches and contact interface stiction of metal-metal switches. Determining the integrity of MEMS devices when subjected to the shock, vibration, temperature extremes, and radiation of the space environment is necessary to facilitate integration into space systems. This paper will explore the effects of different environmental stresses, operational life cycling, temperature, mechanical shock, and vibration on the first commercially available RF MEMS switches to identify relevant failure modes and mechanisms inherent to these device and packaging schemes for space applications. This paper will also describe RF MEMS Switch technology under development at NASA GSFC...|$|R

40|$|Autonomous sensors {{play a very}} {{important}} role in the environmental, structural, and medical fields. The use of this kind of systems can be expanded for several applications, for example in implantable devices inside the human body where it is impossible to use wires. Furthermore, they enable measurements in harsh <b>or</b> <b>hermetic</b> environments, such as under extreme heat, cold, humidity or corrosive conditions. The use of batteries as a power supply for these devices represents one solution, but the size, and sometimes the cost and unwanted maintenance burdens of replacement are important drawbacks. In this paper passive and self-powered autonomous sensors for harsh or hermetical environments without batteries are discussed. Their general architectures are presented. Sensing strategies, communication techniques and power management are analyzed. Then, general building blocks of an autonomous sensor are presented and the design guidelines that such a system must follow are given. Furthermore, this paper reports different proposed applications of autonomous sensors applied in harsh <b>or</b> <b>hermetic</b> environments: two examples of passive autonomous sensors that use telemetric communication are proposed, the first one for humidity measurements and the second for high temperatures. Other examples of self-powered autonomous sensors that use a power harvesting system from electromagnetic fields are proposed for temperature measurements and for airflow speeds...|$|R
