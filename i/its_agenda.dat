5|$|After {{hearing the}} news that the United States had {{informed}} Britain it would be ending its obligations under the Treaty of 1818 and looking for a division of the Oregon Country, the legislature scaled back <b>its</b> <b>agenda.</b> One piece of legislation passed was a pilotage law that set standards and licensed boat pilots {{at the mouth of the}} Columbia River. The 1846 legislature met in the home of Henry Montgomery Knighton in Oregon City from December 1 through 19, with Asa Lovejoy serving as the speaker and leader. Noah Huber served as a clerk and Knighton as sergeant at arms.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{formation}} of the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) in 1972, the UN has made environmental issues a prominent part of <b>its</b> <b>agenda.</b> A lack of success in the first two decades of UN work in this area led to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which sought to give new impetus to these efforts. In 1988, the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), another UN organization, established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assesses and reports on research on global warming. The UN-sponsored Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, set legally binding emissions reduction targets for ratifying states.|$|E

5|$|In {{the midst}} of the primary campaign, the 2007 General Assembly convened. Among the accomplishments of the session were raising the state's minimum wage to $7.25 per hour, {{increasing}} the speed limit on major state highways to , and implementing new safety requirements for social workers and coal miners. Additional legislation stalled after negotiations over how to make the state's retirement system solvent reached an impasse. Fletcher indicated that he would consider calling the Assembly into special session later in the year. In July, Fletcher called the session and included 67 items on <b>its</b> <b>agenda.</b> Democrats in the state House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough to warrant a special session. They claimed the call was an attempt by Fletcher to boost his sagging poll numbers against Beshear, and the House adjourned after only 90 minutes without acting on any of Fletcher's agenda. Fletcher denied the claims and insisted that a tax incentive program was needed immediately to keep the state in the running for a proposed coal gasification plant to be built by Peabody Energy. After negotiating with legislators, Fletcher called another session for August; the session included only the tax incentive program, which the Assembly passed.|$|E

25|$|At first, {{suffrage}} {{was treated}} as a lower priority. The French Revolution accelerated this, with the assertions of Condorcet and de Gouges, and the women who led the 1789 march on Versailles. In 1793, the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women was founded, and originally included suffrage on <b>its</b> <b>agenda</b> before it was suppressed {{at the end of the}} year. As a gesture, this showed that issue was now part of the European political agenda.|$|E
25|$|In 1972 the Australian Labor Party (ALP) came to power.

The Labor Government called a halt to development leases granted by the Northern Territory Land Board that might damage Indigenous rights, suspended mining exploration licences, and gave a small grant of land at Daguragu/Wattie Creek, as an initial step towards the final land handback.|$|E

25|$|The party still {{failed to}} present a true {{challenge}} to the Liberal government, since <b>its</b> <b>agenda</b> was seen as too extreme for the liking {{of central and eastern}} Canada. A notable exception was rural central Ontario, an area that was almost as socially conservative as Reform's western heartland. However, due to massive vote splitting with the PCs, this support only translated into one seat in Ontario during its 1993 breakthrough--the only seat that the party ever won east of Manitoba. That seat was lost in 1997.|$|E
25|$|The AFL {{frequently}} enforced <b>its</b> <b>agenda</b> {{upon its}} member unions with an imposed exclusivity. For example, the United Brewery Workmen (UBW) was affiliated {{with both the}} AFL and the Knights of Labor (KOL) from 1893 to 1896. Their purpose in dual affiliation was increasing {{the breadth of the}} boycott, which they had found a useful weapon. The AFL threatened to revoke the charter of the national UBW, and they withdrew from the KOL, while urging their individual members to keep their membership in the KOL.|$|E

In 1934 {{all the members of}} the Drum Board also sat on the presidential-initiated Baker Board, again setting <b>its</b> <b>agenda</b> to preclude any discussion of air force independence.|$|E
