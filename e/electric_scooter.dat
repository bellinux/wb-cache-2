40|$|Taiwan {{is a place}} marketed by {{intensive}} scooter use {{because of}} limited space and transportation habits. Because internal-combustion-engine scooters cause serious environmental pollution, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) executes policies—such as the strict exhaust standard, “Electric Motorcycle Development Action plan” [...] and provides a subsidy for purchasing <b>electric</b> <b>scooters.</b> The main objective of the EPA has been to {{encourage the use of}} <b>electric</b> <b>scooters</b> and gradually weed out the highly polluting engine scooters. However, the policies have not worked well because of the poor performance of lead-acid or nickel-hydrogen batteries as well as the lack of recharge stations. Therefore, consumers have not been willing to purchase <b>electric</b> <b>scooters.</b> To overcome the problems of battery powered <b>electric</b> <b>scooters,</b> producers have been working to apply fuel cell technology. This paper will discuss the current situation of battery powered <b>electric</b> <b>scooters</b> under the Taiwan government’s supports, as well as the expected development of fuel cell scooters in view of commercial aspects, such as economics, consumer demand, niche markets and government intervention...|$|R
