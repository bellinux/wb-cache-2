5|$|Upon {{arrival in}} Buenos Aires, Eva Duarte was <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{difficulties}} of surviving without formal education or connections. The city was especially overcrowded {{during this period}} because of the migrations caused by the Great Depression. On 28 March 1935, she had her professional debut in the play Mrs. Perez (la Señora de Pérez), at the Comedias Theater.|$|E
5|$|Aerith Gainsborough {{is first}} {{introduced}} as a flower seller, when she briefly converses with Cloud Strife, a mercenary {{working for the}} anti-government group AVALANCHE, who are fleeing from the bombing of a Mako reactor. The two later meet in Aerith's church in the Sector 5 slums, where she is <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> possibility of capture by the Turks. Aerith asks Cloud to be her bodyguard {{for the cost of}} one date. She is eventually apprehended, but is ultimately rescued by Cloud and his allies. Aerith then joins them in the pursuit of Sephiroth, while also embarking on her own journey of self-discovery.|$|E

5|$|As the Mongols of the Ilkhanate {{continued}} {{to move towards}} the Holy Land, city after city fell to the Mongols. The typical Mongol pattern was to give a region one chance to surrender. If the target acquiesced, the Mongols absorbed the populace and warriors into their own Mongol army, which they would then use to further expand the empire. If a community did not surrender, the Mongols forcefully took the settlement or settlements and slaughtered everyone they found. <b>Faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> option of subjugation to or combat with the nearby Mongol horde, many communities chose the former, including some Christian realms.|$|E
5|$|As {{the reigning}} {{champions of the}} UEFA Champions League, Manchester United began their title defence at the group stage, {{for which they were}} given the top seed. This {{position}} amongst the top eight European clubs meant that they would avoid drawing former European champions Barcelona, Internazionale and Real Madrid until at least the first knockout round, although they were <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> prospect of drawing Bayern Munich or Roma. Nevertheless, United ended up being drawn into Group E with two teams they had played against before: Villarreal (whom they had drawn in 2005–06) and Celtic (2006–07); and one they had not: Aalborg BK.|$|E
5|$|At Springfield Elementary School, Bart is busted for {{vandalism}} by Principal Skinner, who {{has been}} informed by class genius Martin Prince. <b>Faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> prospect of failing an intelligence test, Bart surreptitiously switches exams with Martin. When the school psychologist, Dr. Pryor, studies the results, he identifies Bart as a genius, {{to the delight of}} Homer and Marge, who enroll him in a new school. However, Lisa is not fooled by his supposed genius and still believes Bart to be a moron; Skinner shares her belief, but takes advantage of Bart's departure from the school.|$|E

But, when <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> controversial issue of whether an offshore wind farm should be allowed in the waters off the Cape Cod coast in Massachusetts, a major tourist destination and boating location, he expressed opposition, saying he believed it would hinder tourism and boating in the area.|$|E
5|$|By August, as the {{serviceability}} and {{the quantity}} of the Luftwaffe's inventory steadily diminished due to combat, demand for air support only increased as the VVS recovered. The Luftwaffe found itself struggling to maintain local air superiority. With the onset of bad weather in October, the Luftwaffe was on several occasions forced to halt nearly all aerial operations. The VVS, although <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same weather difficulties, had a clear advantage thanks to the prewar experience with cold-weather flying, {{and the fact that}} they were operating from intact airbases and airports. By December, the VVS had matched the Luftwaffe and was even pressing to achieve air superiority over the battlefields.|$|E
5|$|Cleph {{kept his}} throne for only 18 months before being assassinated by a slave. An {{important}} {{success for the}} Byzantines was that no king was proclaimed to succeed him, opening a decade of interregnum and making the Lombards who remained in Italy more vulnerable to attacks from Franks and Byzantines. It was only when <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> danger of annihilation by the Franks in 584 that the Lombard dukes elected a new king {{in the person of}} Authari, son of Cleph, who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the Lombard kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Confronted by an openly hostile Byzantine Empire, and <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> eventuality {{that the}} war with the Lombards would be renewed at the truce's expiration, Thurisind searched for new allies {{as a way to}} {{pressure}} Justinian. He found assistance from the Kutrigurs, who he ferried across the Danube into the Byzantine Illyricum in 550 or 551, before the truce expired and probably before the Gepids were ready to precipitate a new conflict. In retrospect, it may be they arrived too late instead of too early, if the agreement had been made with the Second Lombard–Gepid War in mind.|$|E
5|$|Delta Squad {{kills the}} Riftworm {{before it can}} sink Jacinto {{and returns to the}} surface. They are ordered to {{investigate}} a nearby abandoned COG outpost where they encounter experimented creatures of unknown origin and learn of a back door entrance to the Hollow in the nearby Kadar Mountains. They find prisoner cages and Dom convinces Marcus that Maria (Dom's wife) must be inside one of them. They manage to find her, but the Locust imprisonment and torture has left her severely disfigured and traumatized, unable to communicate. <b>Faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> nigh-vegetative state Maria is in, Dom tearfully chooses to euthanize her. Marcus and Dom then charge into the Locust stronghold.|$|E
5|$|<b>Faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Kutrigur invasion, Justinian {{activated}} his alliance {{against the}} invaders, mobilizing the neighbouring Utigurs, {{who in turn}} asked for help from the allied Crimean Tetraxites. The latter invaded the Kutrigur homeland, {{taking advantage of the}} fact that many warriors were employed at that moment in the Balkans. Informed of the attack, the Kutrigurs were forced to leave the Balkans to defend their homeland on the north-western shore of the Black Sea.|$|E

5|$|<b>Faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> clear hostility of the Russian Emperor Nicholas I, Wallachian revolutionaries sought {{instead a}} {{rapprochement}} with the Ottoman leadership. Efforts {{were made to}} clarify that the movement did not seek to reject Ottoman suzerainty: for this purpose, Ion Ghica was sent to Istanbul as early as May 29, 1848; his mission was initially successful, but later events led Sultan Abdülmecid I to reconsider his position, especially after being faced with Russian protests. Süleyman Pașa, Abdülmecid's brother-in-law, was dispatched to Bucharest with orders {{to report on the}} situation and take appropriate measures.|$|E
5|$|<b>Faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{prospect}} of a takeover by the pro-communists, UMNO changed their minds about the merger. On 27 May, Malaya's Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, mooted {{the idea of a}} Federation of Malaysia, comprising existing Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Brunei and the British Borneo territories of North Borneo and Sarawak. The UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Borneo territories would offset Singapore's Chinese population. The British government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent Singapore from becoming a haven for communism.|$|E
5|$|Following the hasty {{departure}} of PedroI, Brazil {{was left with}} a five-year-old boy as head of state. With no precedent to follow, the Empire was <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> prospect of a period of more than twelve years without a strong executive, as, under the constitution, PedroII would not attain his majority and begin exercising authority as Emperor until 2 December 1843. A regency was elected to rule {{the country in the}} interim. Because the Regency held few of the powers exercised by an emperor and was completely subordinated to the General Assembly, it could not fill the vacuum at the apex of Brazil's government.|$|E

In the 1942 Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). As the war progressed he was <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> difficulty of juggling resources to maintain both the 2nd New Zealand Division in the Middle East and the 3rd New Zealand Division in the Pacific theatre. Later in the war, he was in favour keeping the 2nd Division in Italy {{to deal with what}} he considered to be the greater priority, the defeat of Germany, rather than have it be used against the Japanese.|$|E

A close friend of both Roosevelt and Mercer who was present, Elizabeth Shoumatoff, rushed Mercer away to avoid negative publicity and implications of infidelity. When Eleanor heard about her husband's death, she was also <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> news that Anna had been arranging these meetings with Mercer and that Mercer had been with Franklin when he died.|$|E
