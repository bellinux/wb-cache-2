5|$|During {{the medieval}} and post-medieval periods the {{township}} of Altrincham {{was part of}} Bowdon parish. Low population density meant that the town {{did not have a}} church until the Anglican church established a chapel of ease in 1799. Nonconformists were also present in Altrincham; Methodists set up a chapel in 1790, and Baptists built one in the 1870s. Irish <b>immigrants</b> <b>in</b> the 1830s and 1840s also returned Roman Catholicism to the area, the first Roman Catholic church built in Altrincham being St Vincent's, in 1860.|$|E

In the 1950s, most Armenian <b>immigrants</b> <b>in</b> the US were from Soviet Armenia and Turkey. The Istanbul pogrom in 1955 frightened the local Turkish Armenian population, which looked to the West for a safe and more prosperous life.|$|E
