One is aware of an involuntary hospitality toward a good many authors whom one would once have turned destitute from the door, or with a dole of Organized Charity meal-tickets at the best. But in that maturer time one hesitates, and possibly ends by asking the stranger in, especially if he is young, or even if he is merely new, and setting before him the cold potato of a qualified approval. One says to him: 'You know I don't think you are the real thing quite, but taking you on your own ground you are not so bad. Come, you shall have a night's lodging at least, and if you improve, if you show a tendency to change in the right direction, there is no telling but you may be allowed to stay the week.

Ten to one the stranger does not like this sort of talk, and goes his way--the wrong way.

40|$|Background: Within the GABAA-receptor field, two {{important}} questions are what molecular mechanisms underlie benzodiazepine tolerance, and whether tolerance can be ascribed to certain GABAA-receptor subtypes. Methods: We investigated tolerance to acute anxiolytic, hypothermic and sedative effects of diazepam in mice exposed for 28 -days to non-selective/selective GABAA-receptor positive allosteric modulators: diazepam (non-selective), bretazenil (partial non-selective), zolpidem (a 1 selective) and TPA 023 (a 2 / 3 selective). In-vivo binding studies with [3 H]flumazenil confirmed compounds occupied CNS GABAA receptors. Results: Chronic diazepam treatment resulted <b>in</b> <b>tolerance</b> to diazepam’s acute anxiolytic, hypothermic and sedative effects.

Both strategies may be under genetic control and could thus be targeted for genetic improvement. Although {{there is evidence}} that supports a genetic basis for resistance to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), it is not known whether pigs also differ genetically <b>in</b> <b>tolerance.</b> We determined to what extent pigs that have been shown to vary genetically in resistance to PRRS also exhibit genetic variation <b>in</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Multi-trait linear mixed models and random regression sire models were fitted to PRRS Host Genetics Consortium data from 1320 weaned pigs (offspring of 54 sires) that were experimentally infected with a virulent strain of PRRS virus to obtain genetic parameter estimates for resistance and tolerance. Resistance was defined as the inverse of within-host viral load (VL) from 0 to 21 (VL 21) or 0 to 42 (VL 42) days post-infection and tolerance as the slope of the reaction-norm of average daily gain (ADG 21, ADG 42) on VL 21 or VL 42. ResultsMulti-trait analysis of ADG associated with either low or high VL was not indicative of genetic variation <b>in</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Similarly, random regression models for ADG 21 and ADG 42 with a tolerance slope fitted for each sire did not result in a better fit to the data than a model without genetic variation <b>in</b> <b>tolerance.</b> However, the distribution of data around average VL suggested possible confounding between level and slope estimates of the regression lines. Augmenting the data with simulated growth rates of non-infected half-sibs (ADG 0) helped resolve this statistical confounding and indicated that genetic variation <b>in</b> <b>tolerance</b> to PRRS may exist if genetic correlations between ADG 0 and ADG 21 or ADG 42 are low to moderate. ConclusionsEvidence for genetic variation <b>in</b> <b>tolerance</b> of pigs to PRRS was weak when based on data from infected piglets only. However, simulations indicated that genetic variance <b>in</b> <b>tolerance</b> may exist and could be detected if comparable data on uninfected relatives were available.

40|$|Differences in {{resource}} use or <b>in</b> <b>tolerances</b> to abiotic conditions are often invoked as potential mechanisms underlying the sympatric distribution of cryptic species. Additionally, the microbiome can provide physiological adaptations {{of the host}} to environmental conditions. We determined the intra- and interspecific variability of the microbiomes of three cryptic nematode species of the Litoditis marina species complex that co-occur, but show differences in abiotic tolerances. Roche 454 pyrosequencing of the microbial 16 S rRNA gene revealed distinct bacterial communities characterized by a substantial diversity (85 - 513 OTUs) and many rare OTUs. The core microbiome of each species contained only very few OTUs (2 - 6), and four OTUs were identified as potentially generating tolerance to abiotic conditions. A controlled experiment in which nematodes from two cryptic species (Pm 1 and Pm 3) were fed with either an E.  coli suspension or a bacterial mix was performed, and the 16 S rRNA gene was sequenced using the MiSeq technology. OTU richness was 10 -fold higher compared to the 454 data set and ranged between 1118 and 7864. This experiment confirmed the existence of species-specific microbiomes, a core microbiome with few OTUs, and high interindividual variability. The offered food source affected the bacterial community and illustrated different feeding behaviour between the cryptic species, with Pm 3 exhibiting {{a higher degree of}} selective feeding than Pm 1.

40|$|December 2006. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 62 - 64) This thesis {{presents a}} study of the effect of controllable riveting parameters, mainly squeeze force, rivet length, rivet diameter tolerance, hole countersunk depth and hole diameter tolerance, on the quality of formed rivet. The quality of a formed rivet is determined by the geometry of its head formation {{and the extent to which}} the hole is filled. The study determines maximum allowable tolerance on drilled hole in a 0. 064 ” thick aluminum sheet for a 1 / 8 ” rivet. The study is performed using finite element simulation of the riveting process. Theoretical relations between squeeze force and formed rivet head geometry derived in this study is used to validate the finite element model. Statistical design of experiment is employed to analyze the simulation data of riveting and determine the effect of individual factors, their interactions and relationship with the quality of formed rivet head. The results demonstrate that the correct formation of rivet head geometry depends upon all the factors studied. However, correct geometry of rivet head is not enough to determine the quality of a riveted joint, because the countersunk rivet head does not expand enough to fill up the hole completely, thereby creating a gap and leading to a loose rivet. The gap increases with the increase <b>in</b> <b>tolerances</b> in drilled hole, limiting its allowable tolerances to 0. 006 ”. The length of rivet has no significant effect on the gap formation. To ensure the elimination of gap formation, an alternate procedure with reduced countersunk depth is studied, which allows for increased allowable tolerance in drilled hole. Results show that with as little as 0. 01 ” reduced countersunk depth, the allowable tolerances on drilled hole could be increased to 0. 03 ”, without compromising on the quality of the joint...|$|E
40|$|The {{parametric}} {{effects of}} texture on supratheshold color tolerance thresholds were investigated in two psychophysical experiments using simulated textures presented on a CRT. Textured images were created from scanned photographs of physical texture samples with semi-random textured pattern. Differences in appearance {{were created by}} varying the illumination geometry during the image capture stage. Two conditions were simulated: diffuse illumination of a standard light booth and directional lighting which accentuates texture relief. In the first experiment observers matched average perceived lightness of grayscale textured images by adjusting the lightness of a uniform gray field. Images varied in their average L*. The results showed that, on average, there was {{no statistically significant difference}} between the observer match and the average L of the image. The only exception was found for darker images of coarse texture. In the second experiment, an array of color images was created from three texture patterns: one simulating diffuse lighting conditions and two simulating directional illumination. The CTELAB coordinates of the images were centered around the five CEE color centers recommended for color tolerance research. Color differences were varied in the lightness, chroma, and hue dimensions. Color tolerance thresholds were measured in each dimension for each texture type and uniform patches. An adaptive psychophysical technique, QUEST, was utilized to determine color tolerances in a greater than/less than task using test pairs in comparison to a fixed anchor pair of 1 unit AE* 94. The results indicated that the presence of texture increases tolerance thresholds for hue irrespective of the texture pattern. The chroma dimension remained unaffected. Less conclusive results were found for lightness dimension with a strong trend toward increased tolerance thresholds for textured stimuli. When the different textures were compared, {{it was found that the}} L* thresholds were significantly higher for the images simulating directional lighting compared to the images of diffusely illuminated surface.

Despite the commonness of herbivore-induced damage, vast variation <b>in</b> <b>tolerance</b> ability exists among plants. Recent studies have suggested the role of endoreduplication (increasing ploidy within an individual) and the pentose phosphate pathway (a metabolic pathway that supports both primary and secondary metabolism) in contributing to the variation <b>in</b> <b>tolerance</b> ability among genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana. We measured natural variation in apical meristem damage frequency, endoreduplication, and the sequence of G 6 PD 1, an important gene in the pentose phosphate pathway, and related them to variation <b>in</b> <b>tolerance</b> of natural populations of A. thaliana over a portion of its native European range. Variation among populations <b>in</b> <b>tolerance</b> was significantly positively related to damage frequency, suggesting the potential for directional selection for tolerance ability as a product of damage frequency. We also discovered likely loss-of-function G 6 PD 1 alleles in two populations, both of which displayed among the lowest levels of tolerance of all populations assessed. In addition, populations with the greatest increase in endopolyploidy also had the greatest ability to tolerate damage while populations with the greatest reduction in endopolyploidy had the lowest ability to tolerate damage. This study provides an assessment of variation <b>in</b> <b>tolerance,</b> damage frequency, G 6 PD 1 sequence, and endopolyploidy in natural populations of A. thaliana, and also contributes to the growing body of research on the contributions of these specific molecular mechanisms to the tolerance response...|$|R

This article {{is the first of}} two papers that describe the process of domestication of T. spumosum as a new species to commercial agriculture. This paper describes a broad range of investigations into the ecology, agronomy and rhizobiology of this new species. Through a series of five experiments, we have tested the general hypothesis that T. spumosum accessions demonstrate a range of sought-after agronomic traits and offer an alternative to annual Medicago spp. for ley farming systems in the medium to low rainfall areas of the mixed crop/livestock zone of southern Australia. T. spumosum presents seeds {{at the top of the}} canopy in heads that do not readily shatter, so seed can be harvested using conventional cereal harvesters instead of the specialist suction equipment required for harvest of seed from annual T. subterraneum and Medicago spp. T. spumosum was found to be relatively fecund and had high levels of biomass production in comparison to the other annual legumes that were tested. The species also demonstrated high levels of within-season hardseededness (remaining hard in summer and softening in autumn) so seedbanks would be protected from summer rainfall events. In addition, T. spumosum showed high levels of between-season dormancy, which allows the species to carry a seedbank through a cropping phase or series of poor seasons. A herbicide experiment showed that clover species varied <b>in</b> <b>tolerances,</b> with T. spumosum the least sensitive of all of the legumes tested to Flumetsulam.

Inactivation by UVA and UVB {{radiation is}} especially important for the control of fungi that disperse infective units through the air, including fungi such as Cryptococcus spp. that infect their vertebrate hosts by inhalation. Cryptococcus neoformans produces melanin in the presence of certain exogenous substrates such as l- 3, 4 dihydroxyphenylalanine and melanization may protect the fungus against biotic and abiotic environmental factors. In the present study, we investigated the effect of exposure to an UVB irradiance of 1000 mW m(- 2) (biologically effective weighted irradiance) on the survival of melanized and nonmelanized cells of four strains of C. neoformans and four strains of C. laurentii. The relative survival (survival of cells exposed to radiation in relation to cells not exposed) of cells grown 2, 4, 6 or 8 days on medium with or without L-dopa was determined after exposure to UVB doses of 1. 8 and 3. 6 kJ m(- 2). Both the irradiance spectrum and the intensities of those doses are environmentally realistic, and, in fact, occur routinely during summer months in temperate regions. Differences in tolerance to UVB radiation were observed between the C. neoformans and C. laurentii strains. The C. neoformans strains were more susceptible to UVB radiation than the C. laurentii strains. In C. neoformans, differences in tolerance to radiation were observed during development of both melanized and nonmelanized cells. For most treatments (strain, time of growth and UVB dose), there were virtually no differences <b>in</b> <b>tolerances</b> between melanized and nonmelanized cells, but when differences occurred they were smaller than those previously observed with UVC. In tests with two strains of C. laurentii, there was no difference in tolerance to UVB radiation between melanized and nonmelanized cells during 8 days of culture; and in tests with four strains for less culture time (4 days) there were no significant differences in tolerance between melanized and nonmelanized cells of any strain of this species.

40|$|The thesis {{presented}} in this report has been made on behalf of Scania and their basic frame design department with the subject to solve an implementation of a weight sensing system in the chassis. The system {{is supposed to be}} implemented in the seat springs, and {{the reason for this is}} that all the force will have to go through the weight sensing transducers. With all the force going through the transducers the weight sensing system will not be sensitive for the differences <b>in</b> <b>tolerances</b> from manufacturing. The transducers could be pre-calibrated to avoid a calibration of the whole vehicle after it’s completed from the manufacturing line. Weight sensing systems is today a reality in trucks with air springs. Complete systems is also sold in the big aftermarket for trucks. None of Scanias competitors have a solution for this as of today. The thesis was from start limited to only process the BT- 301 S bogie. A system will likely be easy to adapt to the other bogies with small modifications. Through the thesis possible problems are illuminated to understand the function and make a properly working weight sensing system. In the present bogie system the main problem for a proper function is the frictional forces that appears in the surface between the spring and the spring seat.   In the report a proposition with a rubber part between the spring and the spring seat is introduced, with the idea to get around the known problems with the frictional forces. The rubber itself does produce a reaction force when deformed, but the forces could through simulation be known, and hence compensated for. A rubber part under the spring would result in a contact surface much higher than today. A new spring, or a new version of the spring, will be needed for this solution to work. For the work to come, Scania need to decide what precision the weight sensing system need. But smaller decisions like the size and stiffness for the rubber part will also be needed. This thesis has only dealt with the bogie, but in a close future, the front axles need to be done. Much can likely be carried over from this thesis for that. A weight sensing might be possible to implement, but with what precision at uneven ground? Most likely will the variation in load on the transducers be too much. An approximation for the precision with a total span of 7 % is realistic...|$|E

This might be involved <b>in</b> the <b>tolerance</b> to Zn deficiency, damage by Zn-deficient stress, or Zn homeostasis. To better understand these mechanisms, it is important to elucidate the differences between Zn-efficient and Zn-inefficient cultivars, and the molecular functions of each gene involved <b>in</b> <b>tolerance</b> to Zn deficiency should be revealed.|$|R
40|$|A simple {{ion leakage}} assay {{was used to}} test if {{specific}} hardening treatments can increase desiccation <b>tolerance</b> <b>in</b> the moss Atrichum androgynum. Reducing the relative water content (RWC) of apical stem segments to c. 0. 6 for 3 d, followed by storing the material fully hydrated for 1 d typically reduced the proportion of intracellular K’ lost following desiccation by between 15 and 20 % compared with controls kept moist. Reducing the RWC of the plants further during hardening by using air of lower humidities during hardening did not further increase tolerance. An optimal increase <b>in</b> <b>tolerance</b> occurred after 3 d of hardening; no further increase <b>in</b> <b>tolerance</b> occurred by extending the hardening period to 5 d. While heat shock had no effect, treating the moss with abscisic acid (ABA) for 1 h followed by storage for 3 d in the light increased resistance to ion leakage to the same extent as partial dehydration. The ABA-induced increase <b>in</b> <b>tolerance</b> was much less if plants were pre-treated in the dark, and could be abolished by simultaneously treating the moss with the protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexamide. Results indicated that A androgynum possesses inducible tolerance mechanisms that reduce desiccation-induced damage...|$|R

Building on theories that suggest that enhanced cognitive abilities are responsible for this increase <b>in</b> <b>tolerance,</b> we hypothesized that certain educational institutions would increase individuals’ willingness to extend civil liberties to nonconformist groups.

Altogether, these findings suggest that tolerance is directly related to educational programs from which students can learn democratic values...|$|R
