5000|$|The {{amount of}} fiber in a fiber {{reinforced}} composite directly corresponds with the mechanical properties of the composite. Theoretically the maximum fiber ratio of round fibers {{that can be achieved}} in a composite is 90.8% if the fibers are in a unidirectional hexagonal close packed configuration. Realistically the highest fiber volume ratio is around 70% due to manufacturing parameters and is usually in the range of 50% to 65%. Adding too little fiber reinforcement in the composite will actually deteriorate the properties of the material. Too much fiber volume may also decrease the strength of the composite {{due to the lack of}} space for the matrix to fully surround and bond with the fibers. Therefore, there is an optimal space between fibers that will fully exploit the uniform load transfer between fibers. Given the fiber volume fraction, the theoretical elastic properties of a composite can be determined.

40|$|International audienceIntroduction: In {{diffusion}} MRI, Spherical Deconvolution (SD) {{was proposed}} {{to estimate the}} fiber Orientation Distribution Function (fODF) based on spherical deconvolution using a single-fiber response function [1, 2]. The peaks or the shape of fODFs {{can be used to}} infer local <b>fiber</b> <b>directions.</b> Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) [1], which takes into consideration the non-negative of the fODF, is the most widely used method among SD variants. Although CSD is capable of accurately determining <b>fiber</b> <b>directions,</b> it is susceptible to false positive peaks especially in the regions with lowanisotropy. This is a common drawback of all existing SD-based methods. Moreover, in practice the fODF estimated using CSD still has significant negative values. We propose a method called Non-Negative Spherical Deconvolution (NNSD) to solve the above two problems. Based on a Riemannian framework of ODFs [3] and Square Root Parameterized Estimation for non-negative definite Ensemble Average Propagator [4], NNSD is formulated such that the non-negativity of the fODF is guaranteed with largely reduced false positive peaks...|$|R

A limited number of fibers with low initial fiber volume fraction is defined and depending on the loading condition the fibers are either synthesized or degraded.

50|$|A typical {{characteristic}} of many animals that utilize undulatory locomotion {{is that they}} have segmented muscles, or blocks of myomeres, running from their head to tails which are separated by connective tissue called myosepta. In addition, some segmented muscle groups, such the lateral hypaxial musculature in the salamander are oriented at an angle to the longitudinal direction. For these obliquely oriented fibers the strain in the longitudinal direction is greater than the strain in the muscle <b>fiber</b> <b>direction</b> leading to an architectural gear ratio greater than 1. A higher initial angle of orientation and more dorsoventral bulging produces a faster muscle contraction but results in a lower amount of force production. It is hypothesized that animals employ a variable gearing mechanism that allows self-regulation of force and velocity to meet the mechanical demands of the contraction. When a pennate muscle is subjected to a low force, resistance to width changes in the muscle cause it to rotate which consequently produce a higher architectural gear ratio (AGR) (high velocity). However, when subject to a high force, the perpendicular fiber force component overcomes the resistance to width changes and the muscle compresses producing a lower AGR (capable of maintaining a higher force output).|$|E
