5|$|Large {{sections}} of the <b>hull</b> <b>plating</b> seem to have fallen off well before the wreck hit the bottom. One such section, {{thought to have been}} from the galleys, separated from the stern in one piece and landed nearby. The force of the water tore up the poop deck and folded it back on itself. The center propeller is totally buried, while the force of the impact caused the two wing propellers and shafts to be bent upwards by an angle of about 20°.|$|E

Corrosion of <b>hull</b> <b>plates</b> may decrease the strength and life of the ship, thus reducing the safety program can reduce the load cargo and passenger ships. To avoid greater losses due to sea water corrosion, we need a corrosion protection on the <b>hull</b> <b>plate.</b> Until now, one way to protect the <b>hull</b> <b>plate</b> from corrosion is cathodic protection method. Cathodic protection method often used is the sacrificial anode system. Sacrificial anode types {{used in this study}} is aluminum alloy.

5|$|On {{her last}} {{training}} cruise in 1936, Karlsruhe was badly damaged by {{a tropical storm}} in the Pacific Ocean. Structural weaknesses in her mostly-welded <b>hull</b> <b>plating</b> caused significant damage, and the cruiser was forced to put into San Diego in April for repairs. There, her hull was repaired and strengthened, which increased her displacement and beam slightly. She returned to Germany in June 1936, and immediately went into drydock for more permanent repairs and a major overhaul. During this period in dockyard hands, she had her two single-mount 8.8cm anti-aircraft guns replaced with three twin-mounts. Fire control directors were also installed for these guns. After emerging from this refit, she conducted sea trials and then joined the non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War, though she only remained off Spain for a few months.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} modelling and {{finite element}} simulation {{and the subsequent}} buckling analysis on the the historic Medway Queen paddle steamer ship which is under reconstruction now. The objective {{of this study is}} to assess buckling strength of the <b>hull</b> <b>plate</b> due to the longitudinal stress in the <b>hull</b> <b>plates</b> of the Medway Queen under various sea and live load conditions. A beam finite element analysis with structural elements is utilised to assess shear stress and bending moments of the ship structure. The model predictions for longitudinal stresses in <b>hull</b> <b>plates</b> are combined with buckling assessments on the <b>hull</b> <b>plates</b> in different, judged to be the most critical, locations along the ship's length. The structural beam model is utilised to simulate the ship's stress behaviour under hogging and sagging conditions with three different wave heights and four sets of live loads. From the longitudinal bending moment and shear force of all 24 simulation cases, extreme locations are identified and critical buckling stress on the plates close to these locations is predicted and compared with actual axial and shear stresses on the <b>hull</b> <b>plate</b> to predict the condition at which the buckling structural failure occurs...|$|R

25|$|Hull G19 {{was built}} by Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard, in Saint-Nazaire, France, her keel being laid down on 7 September 1957. She was built in a {{pioneering}} manner: rather than constructing a skeleton which was then covered in steel <b>hull</b> <b>plating,</b> {{large parts of the}} ship were prefabricated in other cities (such as Orléans, Le Havre and Lyon). The hull was fully welded, leading to weight savings, and two sets of stabilisers were fitted.|$|E

25|$|Both {{sections}} {{struck the}} sea bed at considerable speed, causing the bow to crumple and the stern to collapse entirely. The bow {{is by far}} the more intact section and still contains some surprisingly intact interiors. In contrast, the stern is completely wrecked; its decks have pancaked down {{on top of each other}} and much of the <b>hull</b> <b>plating</b> was torn off and lies scattered across the sea floor. The much greater level of damage to the stern is probably due to structural damage incurred during the sinking. Thus weakened, the remainder of the stern was flattened by the impact with the sea bed.|$|E

25|$|After the refit, Voima resumed {{her duties}} as an escort icebreaker. As more {{powerful}} icebreakers entered {{service in the}} 1980s and 1990s, she has operated mainly in the Gulf of Finland. During the particularly mild winters of 1995 and 2002, she remained at stand-by at Katajanokka through the winter. Although Voima {{had been involved in}} minor collisions and other incidents in the past, she had not been grounded until 11 April 2003, when she ran aground while assisting a small German cargo ship in difficult conditions outside Helsinki. However, there were only minor dents in the <b>hull</b> <b>plating</b> and some damage to the bow propeller blades, which were repaired at Vuosaari shipyard on 14–17 April.|$|E
25|$|Inspection {{disclosed}} that the bombs had dished in the <b>hull</b> <b>plating</b> {{in the vicinity}} of the after torpedo room and the maneuvering room, causing a leak in a vent riser. Less than ten minutes after the Japanese plane had been sighted, the commanding officer decided to discontinue the patrol. Throughout the ship, sheared off valves and bolts, damaged meters, clocks, and gauges attested to the force of the bomb's explosion. In addition, all three radio antennas were down, a leak in her pressure hull had been aggravated, and Tunnys rudder action indicated possible damage. She set her course for Balintang Channel and surfaced late in the day on 2 September. Tunny continued to sight Japanese airplanes as she made her way to Hawaii. She completed this patrol on 17 September at Pearl Harbor.|$|E
25|$|The {{rebuilding}} {{and expanding}} of the Finnish icebreaker fleet continued until all Finnish ports could be kept open year-round. In the late 1970s, the first post-war icebreakers were approaching either mid-life update or retirement. As a result, the 25-year-old Voima was extensively rebuilt by Wärtsilä Helsinki Shipyard in 1978–1979 {{at a cost}} of about FIM 86 million, 60% of the price of a new icebreaker of comparable size. In the refit, Voima received new <b>hull</b> <b>plating</b> and additional ice-strengthening, new main engines and a completely new superstructure to accommodate the crew, and her propulsion motors and electrical systems were completely refurbished. After the refit, Voima was practically a new ship with only web frames, bottom plating, forepeak and propellers remaining from the original ship and, at 14,000 shaft horsepower, the third most powerful icebreaker of Finland at the time. She returned to service on 10 October 1979.|$|E

25|$|On 12 December 1911, while {{unloading}} {{potassium nitrate}} {{at the port}} of Santander, Spain, Laënnec was severely damaged when a storm pushed her against the pier and ripped the ship from her moorings, causing the full rigged ship to drift against a Dutch steam ship Rhehania. As there was no shipyard large enough to accommodate Laënnec in Santander, the ship was emptied and inclined until her damaged <b>hull</b> <b>plating</b> was exposed and could be repaired within the harbour. The repairs took 20 days and the ship, which by that time had become a popular attraction for the local people, left Spain on 1 February 1912. In 1914 the main mast of Laënnec broke off and fell over the starboard side when the ship was struck by a heavy storm in the North Atlantic Ocean. She was towed to Brest for repairs. On 12 June 1916 Captain Guriec died onboard Laënnec while the ship was passing the Cape of Good Hope on her way back to Europe. The command was assumed by the first mate who, according to some sources, also perished before the ship arrived in England. Later the command was given to Captain Émile Delanoë.|$|E
25|$|Explorer was {{designed}} to be virtually fireproof and collision-proof. Of the materials used to construct her, 99.5 percent were fireproof, and Johns-Manville asbestos Flexboard paneling covered all of her interior spaces. She was built of heavy steel, and her <b>hull</b> <b>plating</b> and internal subdivision was almost twice that required for a ship of her class, greatly reducing her vulnerability to flooding {{in the event of a}} collision. Eight transverse bulkheads extending up to the main deck divided her into nine watertight compartments, and she {{was designed}} to withstand the flooding of two of the compartments without sinking; only three of the bulkheads were pierced by openings, and these could be sealed by closing electrically driven watertight doors operated from the bridge. To protect her hull from penetration by ice or rocks, Explorer had a double bottom and a 0.5-inch (12.7-mm) steel belt plate along her sides that extended six feet (1.8 meters) above and below the waterline. She was designed for six-month independent deployments, with the capability to service smaller vessels and shore stations. Explorer was equipped with a hospital, machine shop, electrical shop, carpenter shop, laundry, and marine garage. The accommodation for her crew and other embarked personnel were considered especially comfortable for the era. She could carry 99 tons of boiler water, 75 tons of drinking and cooking water, and 325 tons of fuel, giving her a cruising range of 7,000 nautical miles (8,056 statute miles; 12,964km) at a speed of 12 knots (13.8mph; 22.2km/hr).|$|E
