I’m going to destroy everything. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> underground, unconventional. I’d like to get Eric Johnson {{involved}} in this project. They’re guys that I’ve known for years, and great guitar players, but I’d like {{to put them in}} another environment, in a situation that they’ve never been in before. And I’d like to get some sax players—jazz players and other kinds. And I’ll definitely use Shankar Mahadevan, the amazing vocalist who appears on Remember Shakti’s Saturday Night in Bombay. I’ve been thinking about this underground thing for three years but I just haven’t had time to do it. I’m dying to get it out. It’s like giving birth." ...|$|E

The powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job. For me it's about more than turning up and saying the lines. It's about understanding it and trying to make it better. That's actually a lot of fun. What's great is nobody says, 'Just shut up.' They want you to work at it. [...] I surprise myself sometimes because after {{two and a half years}} sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think, 'do <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> else?' but I really like this job, I never get that awful ‘dread’ feeling when you really don’t want to go into work." ...|$|E

A day later, Grande discussed the video's concept and said that it was [...] "the coolest concept ever and he killed it and it's very different. I'm very nervous about it because it's so unique and weird and I feel like brave and different, but it’s exciting".|$|E

I did Dead Snow, then Hansel & Gretel, and then [...] <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> a little bit different now and not just do sequels. I did write the script and I hope to be involved in it. But yeah, I won’t be directing it.” He said [...] "the first film was a learning curve for me working in the studio system and the script I wrote for the original was so different [...] We ended up taking a lot out and altering stuff that first time. I tried taking what I learned and still delivered a sequel script that’s an R-rated action film." [...] Cinema Blend reported Renner said that despite his busy schedule he agreed to reprise the role of Hansel because the first film [...] "was a lot of fun doing the movie," [...] but without Wirkola directing again he might be less likely to return for the sequel.|$|E

2500|$|Favreau had a {{clear vision}} of heavy metal music and guitars for the project, saying that Tony Stark {{was more of a}} rock star than a {{traditional}} superhero, and [...] "there’s Spider-man, Batman and all these superhero movies. This superhero movie’s different. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> completely different, instead of going down the orchestral route. I want to do more rock and roll." [...] Djawadi subsequently composed most of the film's score on guitar, before arranging it for orchestra. Djawadi composed several themes for the character of Tony Stark, representing his different moods and attitudes, all inspired by Robert Downey, Jr.'s performance. Other themes for the film are [...] "not so much character based, but rather plot based that carry you through the movie". Musicians John O'Brien and Rick Boston, frequent collaborators with Favreau, provided a big band-style arrangement of the Iron Man theme song from the 1966 cartoon The Marvel Super Heroes for a scene where Stark attends a casino.|$|E
