5|$|During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Dubrovnik {{was captured by}} the Italians. After a refit, which included the replacement of some of her weapons and the shortening of her mainmast and funnels, she was commissioned into the Royal Italian Navy as Premuda. In Italian service she was mainly used as an escort and troop transport. In June 1942, {{she was part of}} the Italian force that attacked the Allied Operation Harpoon convoy attempting to relieve the island of Malta. In July 1943, she broke <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> into Genoa for repair and a refit. Premuda was the most important and effective Italian war prize ship of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Two years {{following}} Gruntilda's first defeat by Banjo and Kazooie, {{the two are}} playing poker with their friends Mumbo Jumbo and Bottles in Banjo's house. Meanwhile, Gruntilda's sisters Mingella and Blobbelda arrive in a large digging machine, the Hag 1, and destroy the boulder trapping Gruntilda with a magical spell. Unfortunately Gruntilda's time spent underground has rotted her flesh away and reduced her to a skeleton. Seeking revenge, Gruntilda destroys Banjo's house before fleeing with her sisters. Banjo, Kazooie, and Mumbo escape the house, but Bottles, who stays behind believing it is all a joke, gets caught in the blast and is killed. The three remaining friends swear to track Gruntilda <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> an end to her plans.|$|E

25|$|Ron Atkinson left to {{take over}} at Manchester United in June 1981, and {{speculation}} mounted that Robson would either follow him to United or join Bob Paisley's Liverpool. Albion offered Robson a new contract worth £1,000 per week, but he turned it <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> in a transfer request. His teammate Remi Moses signed for United in September 1981 and Robson followed soon afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} year police tracked the family <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> several {{children}} in foster care including Bobby and Billy Colt. Police discovered the living area of 38 members of the family in the woods located on the outskirts of New South Wales. Children and adults had regularly engaged in sexual activities, resulting in children, some with genetic deformities. They had no access to running water, showers, toilets or hygiene products. Most of the children had fungal infections. The Colts were charged with incest and child neglect.|$|E

25|$|Academic {{dress is}} only worn on {{ceremonial}} occasions: the university anniversary or dies natalis, inaugural lectures, {{and the public}} defence of a doctoral thesis. On such occasions, the assembled professors line up as a cortège headed by the university beadle, who also wears an academic gown and carries the university’s mace. Male professors remove their beret when sitting <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> it on when standing up (e.g. to lecture or to address a doctoral candidate during the thesis defence). Female professors may keep the beret on at all times.|$|E
25|$|The Development Corporation needed {{somewhere to}} work from. They {{did not want}} to build new offices; instead they waited for {{suitable}} premises to come up for sale in Crawley. For the first few months, they used temporary offices in London; {{but at the end of}} 1947, Broadfield House (still in use until then as a country club) was closed <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> up for sale. On 23 August 1948, the building reopened as the official headquarters of Crawley Development Corporation, which at that time had 90 employees. More buildings were constructed in the grounds, to house architects and engineers; Crawley-based building firm James Longley & Co. started work on the extension in March 1949 and finished a few months later.|$|E
25|$|Moreover {{at a spot}} in the Park {{where there}} is a charming wood he has another Palace built of cane, of which I must give you a description. It is gilt all over, and most elaborately {{finished}} inside. It is stayed on gilt and lackered columns, on each of which is a dragon all gilt, the tail of which is attached to the column whilst the head supports the architrave, and the claws likewise are stretched out right and left to support the architrave. The roof, like the rest, is formed of canes, covered with a varnish so strong and excellent that no amount of rain will rot them. These canes are a good 3 palms in girth, and from 10 to 15 paces in length. They are cut across at each knot, and then the pieces are split so as to form from each two hollow tiles, and with these the house is roofed; only every such tile of cane has to be nailed down to prevent the wind from lifting it. In short, the whole Palace is built of these canes, which (I may mention) serve also for a great variety of other useful purposes. The construction of the Palace is so devised that it can be taken <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> up again with great celerity; and it can all be taken to pieces and removed whithersoever the Emperor may command. When erected, it is braced against mishaps from the wind by more than 200 cords of silk.|$|E

The meet and greet experience opened March 7, 2014 and is called Captain America: The Living Legend and Symbol of Courage, located at Innoventions in Tomorrowland. Also in January, Marvel Comics released a prelude digital comic titled, Marvel's Captain America: The Winter Soldier Infinite Comic, written by Peter David, with art by Rock-He Kim. The comic sees the return of the [...] "Zodiac", the mysterious weapon first seen in the One-Shot Agent Carter, which has fallen into the wrong hands.

500|$|Torres {{has been}} {{described}} as having [...] "an eye for the spectacular and is capable of world-class skill" [...] and being a [...] "technically proficient, highly successful striker". He has the ability to find himself in goalscoring positions, using his pace and vision to get in behind defenders. A hard-working striker, he is also known for his willingness to chase <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> pressure on opposing defenders, and is capable of playing off of his teammates and creating chances for other strikers, in addition to scoring goals himself; this has also seen him be deployed in a deeper role as a second striker on occasion. Being strong in the air, and an accurate finisher with his head as well as both feet, in his prime, his prolific goalscoring earned him {{a reputation as one of}} the top strikers in the world. However, several injuries led to a loss of form, pace, confidence and a decreased goalscoring rate in more recent seasons.|$|E

[...] After the murder, more than 500 clerics voiced support for the crime and urged a general boycott of Taseer's funeral. Supporters of Mumtaz Qadri blocked police attempting to bring him to the Anti-Terrorism Court in Rawalpindi, and some supporters showered him with rose petals.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{argument}} {{for keeping the}} Elgin Marbles within the UK has been made by J. H. Merryman, Sweitzer Professor of Law at Stanford University and co-operating professor in the Stanford Art Department. He has argued that if the Parthenon were actually being restored, {{there would be a}} moral {{argument for}} returning the Marbles to the temple whence they came, and thus restoring its integrity. The Guardian has written that many among those who support repatriation imply that the marbles would be displayed in their original position on the Parthenon. However, the Greek plan is to transfer them from a museum in London to one in Athens. The sculptures which Elgin did not remove have been taken <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> into the new Acropolis Museum. [...] "Is it more spiritually satisfying to see the Marbles in an Athenian museum gallery than one in London?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{returning}} to Malaya in 1959, {{he was appointed}} as external affairs minister. The following year, a controversy arose when the Tunku stated that Malaya would eventually have to recognise the communist People's Republic of China. This was, in the Tunku's words, [...] "a sudden change in our policy towards Communist China" [...] that had been influenced by private talks between the Tunku and French President Charles de Gaulle. Ismail was outraged by this decision, which had been taken without consultation with him, and directly contradicted Ismail's stated policy of refusing to recognise the People's Republic of China {{as long as they}} backed the Malayan Communist Party, which had waged an armed insurgency against the government. Ismail threatened to resign, and apparently attempted to do so on four separate occasions. The situation was defused by the Tunku refusing to see Ismail, who eventually calmed <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> the incident behind him, behaving [...] "as if nothing had happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|Christina Aguilera was {{recorded}} between 1998 and 1999, with Ron Fair {{serving as the}} album's executive producer. The label reportedly spent $1 million on writers, producers and voice lessons. According to Fair, [...] "She {{was very much a}} raw talent, so building a collection of songs that would become her first album was a time-consuming process. We wanted to find the ones that could knock the door <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> her up there." [...] The album was built around pop songs, which was against Aguilera's will, since she wanted a more R album. She further explained during an interview for The Washington Post: [...] "I was held back a lot from doing more R ad-libbing. They clearly wanted to make a fresh-sounding young pop record and that's not always the direction I wanted to go in. Sometimes they didn't get it, didn't want to hear me out because of my age, and that was a little bit frustrating. Since all the success, it's a little easier to get my opinions across." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{signing a}} record deal with RCA Records, Christina Aguilera {{started working on}} songs from her debut album, set to be {{released}} in January 1999. Ron Fair was the album's executive producer and according to him, [...] "She was very much a raw talent, so building a collection of songs that would become her first album was a time-consuming process. We wanted to find the ones that could knock the door <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> her up there." [...] Famous songwriter Diane Warren was hired to write material for the album, eventually writing [...] "Somebody's Somebody" [...] and suggested that [...] "I Turn to You", which was written for the [...] "Space Jam soundtrack", would be perfect for her voice. Eventually, Aguilera recorded [...] "I Turn to You" [...] and included it on her self-titled debut album, and the song was chosen as the album's third single. It was sent to U.S. radio on March 30, 2000, while its CD single was released on June 13, 2000. A Spanish version of the song entitled [...] "Por Siempre Tú" [...] was recorded and also released as a single, eventually being included on her first Spanish album, Mi Reflejo.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{effect the}} {{opposition}} to the war had was that the American soldiers in Vietnam began to side with the opposition and feel remorse for what they were doing. Zinn argues this with an example in which the soldiers in a POW camp formed a peace committee as they wondered who the enemy of the war was, because it certainly was not known among them. The statement of one of the soldiers reads, [...] "Until we got to the first camp, we didn't see a village intact; they were all destroyed. I sat <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> myself in the middle and asked myself: Is this right or wrong? Is it right to destroy villages? Is it right to kill people en masse? After a while it just got to me." [...] Howard Zinn provides that piece of evidence to reiterate how all of this destruction and fighting against an enemy that seems to be unknown has been taking a toll on the soldiers and that they began to sense a feeling of opposition as one effect of the opposition occurring in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The {{people took}} to {{complaining}} bitterly before God, and at Taberah God ravaged {{the outskirts of}} the camp with fire until Moses prayed, and then the fire died down. The riffraff in their midst ( [...] , asafsuf—compare the [...] "mixed multitude," [...] , erev rav of [...] ) felt a gluttonous craving and the Israelites complained, [...] "If only we had meat to eat! Moses in turn complained to God, [...] "Why have You ... laid the burden of all this people upon me? God told Moses to gather 70 elders, so that God could come <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> some of the spirit that rested on Moses upon them, so that they might share the burden of the people. And God told Moses to tell the people to purify themselves, for the next day they would eat meat. But Moses questioned how enough flocks, herds, or fish could be found to feed 600,000. God answered: [...] "Is there a limit to the Lord's power?" [...] Moses gathered the 70 elders, and God came down in a cloud, spoke to Moses, and drew upon the spirit that was on Moses and put it upon the elders. When the spirit rested upon them, they spoke in ecstasy, but did not continue. Eldad and Medad had remained in camp, yet the spirit rested upon them, and they spoke in ecstasy in the camp. When a youth reported to Moses that Eldad and Medad were acting the prophet in the camp, Joshua called on Moses to restrain them.
