25|$|Human {{soft tissue}} is highly deformable, and its {{mechanical}} properties vary significantly {{from one person}} to another. <b>Impact</b> <b>testing</b> results showed that the stiffness and the damping resistance of a test subject’s tissue are correlated with the mass, velocity, and size of the striking object. Such properties may be useful for forensics investigation when contusions were induced. When solid object impact a human soft tissues, the energy of the impact will be absorbed by the tissues to reducing effect of the impact or the pain level, therefore; subjects with more soft tissue thickness tended to absorb the impacts with less aversion.|$|E
25|$|Newborn {{screening}} tests {{have become a}} subject of political controversy in the last decade. In 2003, two California babies, Zachary Wyvill and Zachary Black, were both born with Glutaric acidemia type I. Wyvill's birth hospital only tested for the four diseases mandated by state law, while Black was born at a hospital that was participating in an expanded testing pilot program. Black's disease was treated with diet and vitamins; Wyvill's disease went undetected for over six months, {{and during that time}} the damage from the enzyme deficiency became irreversible.

40|$|The <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> {{represents}} one of the main tools used by clinicians to assess the presence and severity of a student athlete's concussion (ImPACT Applications, Inc., 2011). Although past research has verified the utility of the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> for assessing cognitive status after concussion, no research has examined the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test's</b> potential for predicting athletic performance in non-concussed athletes (ImPACT Applications, Inc., 2011). This study investigated whether particular composite scores on the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> can predict athletic performance. The composite scores on the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> include Verbal Memory, Visual Memory, Visual Motor Speed, Reaction Time, and Impulse Control. Previous literature showed that broad cognitive domains such as impulse control correlated with athletic performance (Kida & Matsumura, 2005). University of Arizona baseball players' freshman <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> scores were correlated with their freshman year batting statistics, including batting average, slugging percentage, on-base percentage, strikeouts, and walks. The results showed no significant association between measures from the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> and the batting statistics. Therefore, the study suggests that the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> may possess no predictive ability for athletic performance in a non-concussed population...|$|R
