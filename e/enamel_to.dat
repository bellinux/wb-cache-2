25|$|Some sources {{consider}} {{them to be}} of no clinical significance. However, they have been noted {{to be an important}} potential source of enamel fractures that arise after extended use or overloading. It appears that, although enamel easily starts to form the fracture defects of enamel tufts, they then enable <b>enamel</b> <b>to</b> resist the further progress of these fractures, ultimately preventing mechanical failure. This fracture resistance is why tooth enamel is three times stronger than its constituent hydroxyapatite crystallites that make up its enamel rods.|$|E

Many of Levi's experiences of this time found their way into his later writing. They made most of their money from making and supplying stannous chloride for mirror makers, delivering the unstable chemical by bicycle across the city. The attempts to make lipsticks from reptile excreta and a coloured <b>enamel</b> <b>to</b> coat teeth were turned into short stories. Accidents in their laboratory filled the Salmoni house with unpleasant smells and corrosive gases.|$|E
500|$|The {{emphasis}} of the jewellery is very firmly on spectacular badges and pendant jewels of the late Renaissance in {{what is known as}} the [...] "Spanish Style" [...] that was adopted throughout Europe between about 1550 and 1630, using gems together with gold and <b>enamel</b> <b>to</b> create dazzling tiny sculptures. [...] These were originally worn by both men and women, but as a collection the Waddesdon group was chosen for display (and in a specifically male setting) rather than for wearing, except at the occasional fancy-dress ball, a fashion at the time. [...] The group demonstrate little interest in gemstones and pearls for their own sake. Although such pieces have survived more often than styles emphasizing gem stones and massy gold, which were typically recycled for their materials when fashion changed, the demand from 19th-century collectors greatly exceeded the supply of authentic survivals, and many pieces include much work from that period (see below).|$|E

2500|$|As the enamel loses minerals, [...] {{and dental}} caries progresses, the enamel {{develops}} several distinct zones, visible under a light microscope. [...] From the deepest {{layer of the}} <b>enamel</b> <b>to</b> the enamel surface, the identified areas are the: translucent zone, dark zones, body of the lesion, and surface zone. [...] The translucent zone is the first visible sign of caries and coincides with a one to two percent loss of minerals. A slight remineralization of enamel occurs in the dark zone, which serves {{as an example of}} how the development of dental caries is an active process with alternating changes. The area of greatest demineralization and destruction is in the body of the lesion itself. [...] The surface zone remains relatively mineralized and is present until the loss of tooth structure results in a cavitation.|$|E

2500|$|Early colonizers of {{the tooth}} surface are mainly Neisseria spp. and streptococci, {{including}} S. mutans. The growth and metabolism of these pioneer species changes local environmental conditions (e.g., Eh, pH, coaggregation, and substrate availability), thereby enabling more fastidious organisms to further colonize after them, forming dental plaque. Along with S. sobrinus, S. mutans {{plays a major}} role in tooth decay, metabolizing sucrose to lactic acid using the enzyme glucansucrase. [...] The acidic environment created in the mouth by this process is what causes the highly mineralized tooth <b>enamel</b> <b>to</b> be vulnerable to decay. S. mutans is one of a few specialized organisms equipped with receptors that improve adhesion to the surface of teeth. Sucrose is used by S. mutans to produce a sticky, extracellular, dextran-based polysaccharide that allows them to , forming plaque. S. mutans produces dextran via the enzyme dextransucrase (a hexosyltransferase) using sucrose as a substrate in the following reaction: ...|$|E

Then, at last, the eyes lifted to unbroken bluewater--nothing between them and Europe save rolling waves and wave-crests like white plumes. The sea was of a diaphanous blue that shaded through a bold steel blue and a lucent blue <b>enamel</b> <b>to</b> a rich ultramarine which absorbed and healed the office-worn mind. The sails of tacking sloops were a-blossom; sea-gulls swooped; a tall surf-fisherman in red flannel shirt and shiny black hip-boots strode out {{into the water and}} cast with a long curve of his line; cumulus clouds, whose pure white was shaded with a delicious golden tone, were baronial above; and out on the sky-line the steamers raced by.|$|E

50|$|Piaget {{continue}} {{the tradition of}} miniature painting thanks to a traditional technique. The enameller begins by crushing and cleaning raw <b>enamels</b> <b>to</b> obtain a very fine powder, which is then mixed with essential oils to achieve the colour palette. The enamel is applied with a brush in successive fine layers, {{each of which is}} oven-fired at temperatures exceeding 800 °C. Each enamelled piece requires nearly twenty firings in the oven. The enamel and its colours are then set forever.|$|R
50|$|Up {{until the}} 1930s, all enamel {{applications}} required {{two coats of}} enamel: an undercoat {{to adhere to the}} substrate which was always blue (due in part to the presence of cobalt oxides), and a top coat of the desired colour (most often white). It was not until 1930 that the use of zero carbon steel (steel with less than 0.005% carbon content) as a substrate was linked <b>to</b> allowing lighter-colored <b>enamels</b> <b>to</b> adhere directly to the substrate.|$|R
5000|$|Karl Joseph Maria Drerup (1904 - 2000) was {{a leading}} figure in the mid-twentieth-century American enamels field.

50|$|The {{ability to}} apply {{porcelain}} <b>enamel</b> <b>to</b> sheet steels was not developed until 1900, {{with the discovery}} that making {{minor changes to the}} composition of the enamel, such as including cobalt oxides as minor components, could drastically improve its adhesion ability to carbon steels.

50|$|In medieval Western Europe cloisonné enamel {{technique}} was gradually overtaken {{by the rise}} of champlevé enamel, where the spaces for the <b>enamel</b> <b>to</b> fill are created by making recesses (using various methods) into the base object, rather than building up compartments from it, as in cloisonné.

Plique-à-jour is a related enameling technique which uses clear enamels and no metal backplate, producing an object that has the appearance of a miniature stained glass object - in effect cloisonné with no backing.
