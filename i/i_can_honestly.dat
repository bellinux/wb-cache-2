500|$|After England had amassed 496 in {{the first}} innings, Australia had slumped to 3/68 with Bradman one of the {{dismissed}} batsmen. Harvey, {{the youngest member of}} the squad, joined cavalier all-rounder Keith Miller. Australia were more than 400 behind and if England were to remove the pair, they would expose Australia's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to take a large first innings lead. Upon arriving in the middle, Miller greeted him cheerfully and said to Harvey, [...] "OK, mate, get up the other end. [...] I'll take the bowling for a while until you get yourself organised." [...] Harvey said, [...] "Mate, that will do me." [...] I couldn't get up the other end quick enough. [...] I watched him play a few overs and I thought, [...] "This is good", and then they brought Laker on to bowl. [...] The third and the fifth balls of Laker's over disappeared over my head, on the way up, and they both finished in the crowd for six[...] [...] [...] <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>honestly</b> thank Keith Miller for the confidence he gave me during our partnership [...] [...] [...] and it did so much for my future cricket career." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Liedtke and George Avalos of the Contra Costa Times {{were pleased}} with the episode and wrote, [...] "The latest episode also {{contained}} many {{of the elements of}} a classic mythology episode. The stakes were huge and the heroes faced the greatest of hazards. The use of the oil rig created a sense of isolation for Mulder and Doggett, and the paranoia levels were sky-high. We still can't figure out why we haven't seen more episodes along the lines of Vienen during the past three seasons." [...] Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "B–". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave Vienen a positive review, and wrote, [...] "after watching 'Vienen', <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>honestly</b> say that for once of the few times this season, it felt good to be an X-Files fan again". Kessenich praised the significant development in Mulder and Scully's relationship and the return of the [...] "fourth season version" [...] of the black oil; the 1998 movie had dramatically altered the nature of the substanceinfected hosts gestate aliens inside their bodies rather than merely being taken over.|$|E
500|$|The album's Roman numeral title {{referred}} {{to each of}} the band members having turned 20 years old by the time xx was released. Because of their age, many critics interpreted the songs as nocturnal depictions of adolescent lust. Philip Sherburne wrote in Spin that xx brimmed with a [...] "young lust" [...] often found in rock music, and recordings such as [...] "Fantasy" [...] and [...] "Shelter" [...] expressed a jaded yearning, particularly in a lyric from the latter song: [...] "Can I make it better with the lights turned on". Croft vehemently denied this: [...] "We were writing these songs when we were 17. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>honestly</b> say I've never thought this is about my sex life." [...] Croft and Sim, who were both gay, did not intend for the songs to be heard as romantic duets; she said they were singing [...] "past each other" [...] rather than to each other. Having combined their individually written lyrics, they could not definitely explain what their songs were about, although Croft said Sim's lyrics resonated with her nonetheless and enjoyed the personal interpretation it offered. [...] "You can put them into your own life", she explained, [...] "like, 'Oh, this is my song. The romantic situations Sim wrote of had been inspired by other people. [...] "I hadn't really had any relationships to be working off, but I had a huge interest in life, and looking at other people's relationships around me", he said.|$|E

2500|$|Voice of Desmond Miles, Nolan North, urged Ubisoft {{to adopt}} motion capture methods similar to Naughty Dog's Uncharted. Speaking in an interview, North {{admitted}} there's a [...] "disconnect" [...] in the Ubisoft game's current setup, which has voice actors provide voice facial animation separately from body motion capture, which is recorded by different actors. [...] "I wish it wasn't done separately," [...] North said. [...] "Don't get me wrong, the mo-cap actors {{do a great}} job, but {{there will always be}} somewhat of a disconnect when it's done this way. After my experiences on the Uncharted franchise, where the actors do both performance and voice, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>honestly</b> say there is absolutely a difference," [...] he added.|$|E
2500|$|The first street single was {{released}} on March 18, 2008 [...] "Big Dreams" [...] which is produced by Cool & Dre. The Game commented on Power 106 that the song would not be released on any specific album, including the upcoming LAX. However, {{a modified version of}} the song, with different lyrics in the third verse, was later included on the bonus disc of the [...] "Deluxe Version" [...] of the album. Dre, from the production duo Cool & Dre commented that [...] "'Big Dreams' is one of the most amazing records that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>honestly</b> say that me and Cool have been a part of". Dre continued by stating [...] "'Big Dreams' is a phenomenal record. It's very inspirational, It's gonna be big in the streets, but it's gonna be big all across the board. I feel like 'Hate It or Love It' was such an inspirational record that a lot of people didn't see coming. And this has the same feel as far as how it makes you feel, but it's gonna inspire the shit outta everybody. It's one of those records — his performance, his delivery, he's lyrically on a level that I can't even compare anyone to. He stepped it up to a notch that's amazing. He definitely has a new passion. And the fucking record is gonna really, really destroy." ...|$|E
2500|$|VA-11 HALL-A [...] made {{appearances}} on {{lists of the}} most anticipated video games multiple times before its release. An article by GamesRadar staff of the [...] "12 PAX East games we wish we were still playing" [...] included VA-11 HALL-A; praise was directed at the game's complexity, and how [...] "you can decide to give the customer the drink they ordered, flipping through the recipe book and dragging ingredients into the mixer in a simple minigame, or you can screw it up, and give them something totally different", {{as well as the}} [...] "wildly different directions" [...] the narrative takes as a result. Similarly, Twinfinite's Matthew Byrd ranked VA-11 HALL-A first on the [...] "10 Anticipated Indie Games You Have to Check Out in 2016", writing that: [...] "While <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>honestly</b> say that I've never specifically wished for a cyberpunk bartending game before, now that I know such a thing exists, it is all that I can think of." [...] Zach Budgor of Kill Screen described VA-11 HALL-A as one of their favourite titles at Cyberpunk Game Jam 2014, describing it as [...] "self-styled 'cyberpunk bartender action' with detailed art and an LP's worth of bass-heavy future bangers." [...] PC Gamer added VA-11 HALL-As playable prologue to their list of [...] "The best free PC games". Upon release, Thomas Faust of IndieGames.com labelled VA-11 HALL-A the best game of the year, adding [...] "as far as I'm concerned, the rest of 2016 can go home now. Game of the year right there, bam." [...] Faust also noted that the slice of life setting of VA-11 HALL-A, as well as its characters, are a departure from more conventional video game settings. Similarly, Gizmodo UK on June 25 listed VA-11 HALL-A as their top recommended video game for the week. Ana Valens of Den of Geek also listed VA-11 HALL-A as [...] "one of the great visual novels of 2016", again praising the game's characters and [...] "powerful" [...] writing.|$|E

60|$|Honestly, I was astonished. It {{had seemed}} so natural having Percy always with us, so {{pleasant}} listening to his sensible conversation, {{so different from the}} light flow of badinage we heard of an evening--it seemed such a matter of course, to enjoy the little quiet--well--flirtation at the opera, that, up to this moment, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say <b>honestly</b> that it had never seriously entered my head that Percy Desborough cared for me. As, however, I thought over all our conversation together, not so much what he had said as the way in which he had said it, the conviction came over me that perhaps Ada was right after all; and the colour came mounting up into my face, till I felt a deep crimson even over my forehead.|$|R

Oh, how I wished I had never allowed myself to be dragged into this dreadful business. Yes, and I was even mean enough to wish that I had broken my word to Panda and gone off with John Dunn when he invited me, although now I thank goodness that I did not yield to that temptation and thereby sacrifice my self-respect.|$|R
5000|$|After being {{signed by}} Island Records and {{starting}} her own imprint, MonarC Entertainment, Carey released her intended [...] "comeback" [...] album Charmbracelet (2002).

Tom said he thought that the Arab was a-taking us to sell as curios to some fellow who had never seen white men before, and it turned out as he was right.

[...] The {{introduction}} is skeletal as it contains only atmospheric synthesizers and insistent drum tapping, which have been further described as [...] "warbly [...] lighthearted". Throughout the song, the swaths of reverb occasionally pierce through the production. In the pre-chorus lines, Knowles sings: [...] "Maybe it's over, maybe we're through, but <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>can</b> say <b>I</b> still love you / Maybe we reached a mountain peak and there’s no more left to climb / and maybe we lost a magic piece and we're too blind to find" [...] while her vocals are followed by background sounds. The beat steadily grows from the verses to the bridge and, finally, to the chorus, with pounding drums coming into the loop during the refrain as Knowles sings: [...] "Let’s start over / Let's give love their wings / Let’s start over / Stop fighting bout the same old thing". As she belts the high notes and the drum beats continue to catch up, she urges her man to [...] "give love another life". During the bridge, Knowles sings: [...] "I know I called you selfish / But that’s a lie", over a simple piano line.|$|R
