His demise dashed any hopes for the reconciliation of Goth and Roman in Italy, and led to further years of bloodshed, until the peninsula was definitively conquered by the Byzantines.|$|E

Bayern and Müller were back in Berlin the following week, to face Werder Bremen in {{the final of the}} DFB-Pokal. Müller started the match and Bayern won 4–0 to complete the domestic double. Müller scored four goals and made two assists during the competition, which made him its leading scorer for the season. Bayern's season ended in pursuit of a first treble, in the 2010 Champions League Final against Inter Milano at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be, however, as they lost 2–0, with both goals coming from Diego Milito. Müller was in the starting line-up and had a key chance just after half-time, with Bayern 1–0 down, but his shot was saved by Júlio César. Müller felt particularly disappointed by this defeat, but he ended his first season as a first-team player with 52 matches played and 19 goals in all competitions.|$|E

In the first match on English soil, against East Molesey, Bill Johnston, Australia’s leading wicket-taker in 1948, broke down with a serious knee injury. Hassett {{struggled in}} the opening first-class matches in England, passing 40 only once in six innings. In the last match before the Tests, against Sussex, he hit an unbeaten 108. Australia's progress before the Tests was constantly curtailed by bad weather. Of the six first-class matches that Hassett played, three did not reach the second innings, although Australia did manage two victories.|$|E
5|$|In January 1973, {{hope was}} renewed when the Paris Peace Accord was signed, ending the {{conflict}} (for the time being) in South Vietnam and Laos. On 29 January, Lon Nol proclaimed a unilateral cease-fire throughout the nation. All U.S. bombing operations were halted {{in hopes of}} securing a chance for peace. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be. The Khmer Rouge simply ignored the proclamation and carried on fighting. By March, heavy casualties, desertions, and low recruitment had forced Lon Nol to introduce conscription and, in April, insurgent forces launched an offensive that pushed into the suburbs of the capital. The U.S. Air Force responded by launching an intense bombing operation that forced the communists back into the countryside after being decimated by the air strikes. The US Seventh Air Force argued that the bombing prevented the fall of Phnom Penh in 1973 by killing 16,000 of 25,500 Khmer Rouge fighters besieging the city.|$|E

5|$|Most in {{the crowd}} {{believed}} they knew what would follow; Constantine and Maxentius, the only adult sons of a reigning emperor, men who had long been preparing to succeed their fathers, would be granted the title of caesar. Constantine had traveled through Palestine at the right hand of Diocletian, and {{was present at the}} palace in Nicomedia in 303 and 305. It is likely that Maxentius received the same treatment. In Lactantius' account, when Diocletian announced that he was to resign, the entire crowd turned to face Constantine. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be: Severus and Maximin were declared caesars. Maximin appeared and took Diocletian's robes. On the same day, Severus received his robes from Maximian in Milan. Constantius succeeded Maximian as augustus of the West, but Constantine and Maxentius were entirely ignored in the transition of power. This did not bode well for the future security of the tetrarchic system.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May 305AD, Diocletian, as {{a result}} of a {{debilitating}} sickness taken in the winter of 304–305AD, announced his resignation. In a parallel ceremony in Milan, Maximian did the same. Lactantius states that Galerius manipulated the weakened Diocletian into resigning, and forced him to accept Galerius' allies in the imperial succession. According to Lactantius, the crowd listening to Diocletian's resignation speech believed, until the very last moment, that Diocletian would choose Constantine and Maxentius (Maximian's son) as his successors. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be: Constantius and Galerius were promoted to Augusti, while Severus and Maximinus Daia, Galerius' nephew, were appointed their Caesars respectively. Constantine and Maxentius were ignored.|$|E

This became the first ever Copa Libertadores finals to feature two teams from the same football association; The Tricolor won their third crown after thrashing Atlético Paranaense in the final leg. The 2006 final was also an all-Brazilian affair, with defending champions São Paulo lining up against Internacional. Led by team captain Fernandão, the Colorados beat São Paulo 2–1 at Estádio do Morumbi and held the defending champions at a 2–2 draw at home in Porto Alegre as Internacional won their first ever title. Internacional's arch-rivals, Grêmio, surprised many by reaching the 2007 final with a relatively young squad. However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be as Boca Juniors, reinforced by aging but still-capable players, came away with the trophy to win their sixth title.|$|E

5|$|SR282 was {{initially}} designated in 1967 solely along Fourth Street from SR75 to the Naval Air Station; however, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be in effect until the San Diego–Coronado Bridge was completed. Nevertheless, before the bridge opened, the designation was {{added in the}} 1968 legislative session, along with the portion of Orange Avenue from the Coronado Ferry landing to Fourth Street, {{which was to be}} removed once the Coronado Bay Bridge opened. The designation came into effect on February 21, 1969. In April, plans were under way to repave Fourth and Third Streets and add signals at the Orange Avenue intersections. The bridge opened on August 3, 1969. In September, the City of Coronado added Third Street as a truck route going westbound to the base, in addition to the already-existing Fourth Street truck route leaving the base.|$|E
5|$|Aldridge {{also started}} the seventh game on October 15. It had been raining {{for a week}} in Pittsburgh, and the sixth game had been rainy. The weather for the seventh was even worse, and the game was played in thick pea soup fog and drizzle, with a very wet {{pitching}} mound. It was hoped that Aldridge would continue his success {{in the first two}} games to the seventh, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be. Although noted for his consistency, in this game Aldridge was very wild; he had had only two days rest and he kept slipping on the slick pitcher's plate. Sam Rice was the first batter, and he hit a single. Then Bucky Harris came out, whose fly out was the only success Aldridge had during the game. Goose Goslin was walked after a wild pitch. Joe Harris was walked after a wild pitch advanced the baserunners. After a full count, Joe Judge was walked, scoring in one run. Then Ossie Bluege hit a single. Pirates manager Bill McKechnie had seen enough and relieved Aldridge. In total, Aldridge gave up three walks, two hits and two wild pitches, resulting in the Senators having a 4–0 lead in the first inning. The Pirates would rally to win the game and the World Series by a score of 9–7, the first time a team won the World Series after a 3–1 deficit. It was the worst start of the seventh game for a pitcher in Series history.|$|E
5|$|In 1535, the abbey's {{income was}} only {{assessed}} at £155 in the Valor Ecclesiasticus, Henry VIII's great survey of church finances. It meant {{the following year}} that it came {{under the terms of}} the first Suppression Act, Henry's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Abbot William Dovell and his 16monks were forced to surrender the abbey on 6 September 1536. There were proposals from local gentry and even some of the king's officials for the Dissolution such as Sir Thomas Arundell that Cleeve should be granted a reprieve, as a number of others among the smaller monasteries were, however, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be and the monks finally left in the spring of 1537. Abbot William was given a pension of 40marks per year, not large but certainly comfortable, which he was still drawing 20years later. Most of the other monks were given pensions too. One former monk of Cleeve rose to prominence and came to a sticky end. This was John Hooper who became Bishop of Gloucester and Worcester and was killed in 1555 for his Protestant beliefs by Mary I.|$|E

5|$|Peter then {{returned}} to Constantinople with letters from Theodahad and the Roman Senate to the imperial couple, bearing pleas for a peaceful solution, {{but by the time}} he reached the imperial capital, Emperor Justinian had resolved on war and was preparing his forces. Consequently, Peter returned to Italy in the summer of 535 conveying an ultimatum: only if Theodahad abdicated and returned Italy to imperial rule, could war be averted. A two-pronged Byzantine offensive followed soon thereafter, attacking the outlying possessions of the Ostrogothic kingdom: Belisarius took Sicily, while Mundus invaded Dalmatia. Upon hearing these news, Theodahad despaired, and Peter was able to secure wide-ranging concessions from him: Sicily was to be ceded to the Byzantine Empire; the Gothic king's authority within Italy was severely restricted; a gold crown was to be sent as an annual tribute and up to 3,000 men were to be provided for the imperial army, underlining Theodahad's subject status. Theodahad, however, fearing that his first offer would be rejected, then instructed Peter, under oath, to offer the cession of all Italy, but only if the original concessions were rejected by Justinian. In the event, Justinian rejected the first proposal, and was delighted to learn of the second one. Peter was sent back to Italy with Athanasius, bearing letters to Theodahad and the Gothic nobles, and for a time it seemed as if the cradle of the Roman Empire would return peacefully to the fold. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be: upon their arrival in Ravenna, the Byzantine envoys found Theodahad in a changed disposition. Supported by the Gothic nobility and buoyed up by a success against Mundus in Dalmatia, he resolved to resist, and imprisoned the ambassadors.|$|E
