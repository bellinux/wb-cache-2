5|$|The {{sport of}} {{track and field}} {{has its roots in}} human prehistory. Track and field-style events are among the oldest of all {{sporting}} competitions, as running, jumping and throwing are natural and universal forms of human physical expression. The first recorded examples of organized track and field events at a sports festival are the Ancient Olympic Games. At the first Games in 776 BC in Olympia, <b>Greece,</b> <b>only</b> one event was contested: the stadion footrace. The scope of the Games expanded in later years to include further running competitions, but the introduction of the Ancient Olympic pentathlon marked a step towards track and field as it is recognized today—it comprised a five-event competition of the long jump, javelin throw, discus throw, stadion footrace, and wrestling.|$|E

The Luftwaffe destroyed 26 of these Yugoslav Dorniers in the initial assault. Total Yugoslav losses stood at four destroyed in aerial combat and 45 destroyed on the ground. Between 14 and 15 April, seven Do 17Ks flew to Nikšić airport and {{took part in the}} evacuation of King Petar II and members of the Yugoslav government to Greece. During this operation, the Yugoslav gold reserves were also airlifted to Greece by seven Do 17s. After completing their task, five Do 17Ks were destroyed when Italian aircraft attacked Paramithia airbase in <b>Greece.</b> <b>Only</b> two Do 17Kb-1s escaped destruction and later joined the RAF in Egypt, where they were allocated the serial numbers AX707 and AX706. However, both machines were destroyed in an air attack on 27 August 1941. During this time, it is also recorded that two Dorniers escaped to the Soviet Union. According to other sources 23 Yugoslav Dorniers survived the April battles, and the RAF received a third machine.|$|E

2500|$|In Germany, Italy and France many clergyman and {{university}} professors gave speeches saying all of Europe owed a huge debt to ancient Greece, {{that the modern}} Greeks were entitled to call upon the classical heritage {{as a reason for}} support and <b>Greece</b> <b>only</b> achieve progress with freedom from the Ottoman Empire. A young medical student in Mannheim wrote that hearing his professor lecture on the need for Greek freedom went through him like an electric shock, inspiring to drop his studies and head to Greece while a Danish student wrote: [...] "How could a man inclined to fight for freedom and justice find a better place than next to the oppressed Greeks?". In France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Russia, the United States and many other places [...] "Greek committees" [...] were established to raise funds and supplies for the revolution. The classicist Edward Everett, professor of Greek at Harvard, was active in championing the Greek cause in the United States and in November 1821 published an appeal from Adhamantios Korais reading [...] "To the Citizens of the United States, it is your land that Liberty has fixed her abode, so you will not assuredly imitate the culpable indifference or rather the long ingratitude of the Europeans", going on to call for American intervention, in several American newspapers. In 1821, the Greek committee in Charleston, South Carolina sent the Greeks 50 barrels of salted meat while the Greek Committee in Springfield, Massachusetts sent supplies of salted meat, sugar, fish and flour. Newspapers in the United States gave the war much coverage and were overwhelmingly pro-Greek in their stance, which explains why American public opinion was so supportive. In New York City, one ball put on by the Greek committee raised $8, 000 dollars. In Russia, the St. Petersburg Greek committee under Prince Alexander Golitsyn had raised 973, 500 roubles by August 1822. By the end of the war, millions of roubles had been fund-raised in Russia for the relief of refugees and to buy Greeks enslaved freedom (through the government forbade buying arms for the Greeks), but no Russian is known to have gone to fight with the Greeks.|$|E

6000|$|Our explanation, whether {{adequate}} or not, is not {{founded on}} an isolated case. If Apollo superseded and absorbed {{the worship of}} the mouse, he did no less for the wolf, the ram, the dolphin, and several other animals whose images were associated with his own. The Greek religion was more refined and anthropomorphic than that of Egypt. In Egypt the animals were still adored, and {{the images of the}} gods had bestial heads. In <b>Greece</b> <b>only</b> a few gods, and chiefly in very archaic statues, had bestial heads; but beside the other deities the sculptor set the owl, eagle, wolf, serpent, tortoise, mouse, or whatever creature was the local favourite of the deity. {118a} Probably the deity had, in the majority of cases, superseded the animal and succeeded to his honours. But the conservative religious sentiment retained the beast within the courts and in the suit and service of the anthropomorphic god. {118b} ...|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, it {{is quite}} a mistake to suppose that mysticism is by its own nature unpractical. The {{greatest}} and most prosperous races of antiquity--the Egyptians, Babylonians, Hindoos, Greeks--had the mystic element as strong and living in them as the Germans have now; and certainly we cannot call them unpractical peoples. They fell and came to ruin--as the Germans may do--when their mysticism became unpractical: but their thought remained, to be translated into practice by sounder-hearted races than themselves. Rome learnt from Greece, and did in some confused imperfect way that which <b>Greece</b> <b>only</b> dreamed; just as future nations may act hereafter, nobly and usefully, on the truths which Germans discover, only to put in a book and smoke over. For they are terribly practical people, these mystics, quiet students and devotees as they may seem. They go, or seem to go, down to the roots of things, after a way of their own; and lay foundations on which--be they sound or unsound--those who come after them cannot choose but build; as we are building now. For our forefathers were mystics for generations; they were mystics in the forests of Germany and in the dales of Norway; they were mystics in the convents and the universities of the Middle Ages; they were mystics, all the deepest and noblest minds of them, during the Elizabethan era.|$|E
60|$|You see, therefore, this tomb is an {{invaluable}} example of thirteenth century sculpture in Venice. In Plate VI., {{you have an}} example of the (coin) sculpture of the date accurately corresponding in Greece to the thirteenth century in Venice, when the meaning of symbols was everything and the workmanship comparatively nothing. The upper head is an Athena, of Athenian work in the seventh or sixth century--(the coin itself may have been struck later, but the archaic type was retained). The two smaller impressions below are the front and obverse of a coin of the same age from Corinth, the head of Athena on one side, and Pegasus, with the archaic Koppa, on the other. The smaller head is bare, the hair being looped up at the back and closely bound with an olive branch. You are to note this general outline of the head, already given in a more finished type in Plate II., as a most important elementary form in the finest sculpture, not of <b>Greece</b> <b>only,</b> but of all Christendom. In the upper head the hair is restrained still more closely by a round helmet, for the most part smooth, but embossed with a single flower tendril, having one bud, one flower, and above it, two olive leaves. You have thus the most absolutely restricted symbol possible to human thought of the power of Athena over the flowers and trees of the earth. An olive leaf by itself could not have stood for the sign of a tree, but the two can, when set in position of growth.|$|E

6000|$|The {{opinion of}} Mr. Max Muller has always {{a right to}} the first hearing from English inquirers. Mr. Muller, naturally, {{examines}} first {{the name of the}} god whose legend he is investigating. He writes: 'There is no such being as Kronos in Sanskrit. Kronos did not exist till long after Zeus in Greece. Zeus was called by the Greeks the son of Time ([Greek]). This is a very simple and very common form of mythological expression. It meant originally, not that time was the origin or source of Zeus, but [Greek] or [Greek] was used in the sense of [...] "connected with time, representing time, existing through all time." [...] Derivatives in -[Greek] and -[Greek] took, in later times, the more exclusive meaning of patronymics. [...] . When this (the meaning of [Greek] as equivalent to Ancient of Days) ceased to be understood, [...] . people asked themselves the question, Why is Zeus called [Greek]? And the natural and almost inevitable answer was, Because he is the son, the offspring of a more ancient god, Kronos. This may be a very old myth in Greece; but the misunderstanding which gave rise to it could have happened in <b>Greece</b> <b>only.</b> We cannot expect, therefore, a god Kronos in the Veda.' To expect Greek in the Veda would certainly be sanguine. 'When this myth of Kronos had once been started, it would roll on irresistibly. If Zeus had once a father called Kronos, Kronos must have a wife.' It is added, as confirmation, that 'the name of [Greek] belongs originally to Zeus only, and not to his later' (in Hesiod elder) 'brothers, Poseidon and Hades.' {58a} ...|$|E
