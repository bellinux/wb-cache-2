40|$|ABSTRACT: It is {{challenging}} {{to control the}} <b>damping</b> forces of magnetorheological (MR) fluid dampers because of the strong nonlinearity between the <b>damping</b> force of an MR fluid <b>damper</b> and the velocity across the <b>damper,</b> and the semiactive relationship between the <b>damping</b> force and the applied voltage/current. Hence, the desired <b>damping</b> force ought to be generated by an MR fluid <b>damper</b> cannot be commanded directly, only the command voltage applied to the current driver for the MR <b>damper</b> can be directly controlled. In this article, the configuration of a semiactive control system with MR fluid dampers is discussed and a <b>damper</b> controller based on signum function for MR fluid dampers is proposed. The <b>damper</b> controller is used to generate and adjust the command voltage to track the desired <b>damping</b> force determined by the system controller based on the desired and the actual <b>damping</b> forces. Two key factors for controlling the <b>damping</b> force of an MR fluid <b>damper</b> through a <b>damper</b> controller are considered in this article: (1) tracking ability of the controlled <b>damping</b> force to the desired <b>damping</b> force, and (2) energy requirement for the MR fluid <b>damper.</b> The characteristics of the controlled <b>damping</b> force and its corresponding command voltage are analyzed and compared with the Heaviside function <b>damper</b> controller. The simulation {{results show that the}} signum function controller outperforms the Heaviside function controller for better <b>damping</b> tracking ability while requiring less energy for the MR <b>damper.</b> Key Words: magnetorheological fluid <b>damper,</b> <b>damper</b> controller, semiactive control, signum function...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Damping</b> {{capacities}} of the annealed {{nodular cast iron}} dense bar produced by horizontal continuous casting were measured by Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer. The relation of <b>damping</b> capacities with vibration amplitude, frequency and temperature was analyzed to investigate the <b>damping</b> mechanism of the alloy. The {{results show that the}} <b>damping</b> capacities increase with increasing temperature and frequency. The internal friction spectra exhibits two internal friction peaks at about 40 ℃ and 150 ℃ and caused by Snoek relaxation and Snoek-Köster relaxation, respectively. The maximum <b>damping</b> capacity can be obtained at about 63 Hz. The <b>damping</b> is positive amplitude-dependent, whereas critical amplitude exists where the <b>damping</b> increases dramatically. The temperature-dependent <b>damping</b> results from the superposition effect of point-defect <b>damping,</b> grain boundary <b>damping</b> and interface <b>damping,</b> while dislocation <b>damping</b> is predominant in the frequency dependent <b>damping.</b> The amplitude dependent <b>damping</b> can be interpreted by G-L theory...|$|R
