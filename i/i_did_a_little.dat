25|$|I made {{a mistake}} going into that fight. I knew Conn was kinda small and I didn't want them {{to say in the}} papers that I beat up on some little guy so the day before the fight <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> roadwork to break a sweat and drank as little water as {{possible}} so I could weigh in under 200pounds. Chappie was as mad as hell. But Conn was a clever fighter, he was like a mosquito, he'd sting and move.|$|E
500|$|The {{head coach}} dealt with young players who {{differed}} from the white, East-Coast students {{with whom he had}} previously worked. At the beginning, he used the then-customary coaching methods of rough language and a strict routine. The Native American students were unaccustomed to such an approach, and several key players stopped attending practices. Warner adjusted his technique, saying that he [...] "found I could get better results. I don't think I ever swore at a player from that time. Maybe <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> cussing, now and then, but never at players." ...|$|E
500|$|Arad later explained, [...] "We {{were working}} on what we called Spider-Man 4 {{and it was the}} same team [...] The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and {{warranted}} ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E

6000|$|... 'I belong {{body and}} soul to my {{proprietor}},' said Pancks; 'you saw my proprietor having his dinner below. But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> in the other way, sometimes; privately, very privately, Miss Dorrit.' ...|$|R
60|$|May 6.--Wrought {{again at}} Hoffmann--unfructuously I fear--unwillingly I am certain; but {{how else can}} <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> good in my generation? I will try a walk. I would fain catch myself in good-humour with my task, but {{that will not be}} easy.|$|R
60|$|For {{the same}} purpose, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> in crime {{on my own}} account.|$|E
6000|$|... “Tony,” {{she said}} simply, “you will forgive me that, though I {{scarcely}} deserve it. If I could have meant it would I have done—what <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> while ago?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{complete}} stranger," [...] Mr. Ascough agreed. [...] "I {{had never}} seen him before in my life. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> trifling business for him in connection with his property." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{an amusing}} experience," [...] Mr. Twelvemough began, [...] "when <b>I</b> was <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> visiting for the {{charities}} in our ward, the other winter." ...|$|R
6000|$|A shadow {{suddenly}} {{crept into}} Valentine's brown face. [...] "Well," [...] he said quietly, [...] "as it happens, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> know <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Oh! you women, {{you make}} such a fuss over everything,” Uncle Podger would reply, picking himself up. “Why, <b>I</b> like <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> job of this sort.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "None, none," [...] {{said the}} Ape-man,--"none escape. See! <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> thing, a wrong thing, once. I jabbered, jabbered, stopped talking. None could understand. I am burnt, branded in the hand. He is great. He is good!" ...|$|E
60|$|The mildest {{tempered}} people, when on land, become {{violent and}} blood-thirsty when in a boat. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boating once {{with a young}} lady. She was naturally of the sweetest and gentlest disposition imaginable, but on the river it was quite awful to hear her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} a woman of many luxuries," [...] she said, [...] "yet I think the sweetest of them all I {{experienced}} at Molchavano. I really think that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> good. After his death I sent to Petersburg for nurses and I stayed at the hospital till they came.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> have <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sailoring myself--as {{much as a}} {{woman can}} aspire to, you know. This is the Bay of Funchal. What a lovely frigate!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank'ee, Hurry; thank'ee, {{with all}} my heart--but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> beavering for myself as {{occasions}} offer. 'Tis true, the Delawares call me Deerslayer, but it's {{not so much because}} I'm pretty fatal with the venison as because that while I kill so many bucks and does, I've never yet taken the life of a fellow-creatur'. They say their traditions do not tell of another who had shed so much blood of animals that had not shed the blood of man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well." [...] Judicious pause. [...] "I should hardly {{call myself}} a Nartist, you know. <b>I</b> <b>DO</b> paint <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> And sketch, you know--skitty kind of things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> You know, uncle, one cannot {{always be}} made a baby. Women don't understand, you know, and don't know what a fool it makes a man to have them always after him, and have {{everything}} put {{out of his way}} like a precious infant, and people drinking it on the sly like Gerald, or—-" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When me and Bill Bassett {{was left}} alone <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sleight-of-mind turn in my head with a trade secret {{at the end of}} it. Thinks I, I'll show this Mr. Burglar Man the {{difference}} between business and labor. He had hurt some of my professional self-adulation by casting his Persians upon commerce and trade.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, come, {{this is a}} nice bit, now. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> in {{this way}} myself at one time, you know. Look here, now; this is what I call a nice thing, done with what we used to call brio." [...] Mr. Brooke held out towards the two girls a large colored sketch of stony ground and trees, with a pool.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I think <b>I</b> should <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> horse-stealing {{and lying}} if I {{could have a}} column to myself in a London daily. What do you say, Scott?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--it was. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> feel <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{proud of}} my success. And I am proud as I see you sitting there, and feel that justice has been done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear one, {{neither will}} it be so much {{pleasure}} to me [...] . But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> take <b>a</b> <b>little</b> delight in my life, I suppose," [...] she pouted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> at Sheppey, but it's so {{hard for}} a poor man {{to get his hands}} on a machine. And here was Solomonson, with this thing in his hangar, eating its head off. Let's take it out," [...] I said, [...] "and go once round the park. And here we are.... I thought it wasn't wise for him to come...." ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{went into}} the dining room, breakfast was prepared, but I {{could not find the}} Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very {{peculiar}} man! After breakfast <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> exploring in the castle. I went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South.|$|E
60|$|August 25.--Mr. Adolphus left us {{this morning}} after a very {{agreeable}} visit. We all dined at Dr. Brewster's. Met Sir John Wright, Miss Haig, etc. Slandered our neighbours, and were good company. Major John Scott there. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more at the review to-day. But I cannot {{go on with the}} tale without I could speak a little Hindostanee--a small seasoning of curry-powder. Ferguson will do it if I can screw it out of him.|$|E
6000|$|Sir Mart. Why do you frown upon me so, {{when you}} know your looks go {{to the heart of}} me? What have <b>I</b> <b>done</b> besides <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lapsus linguæ? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>did</b> feel <b>a</b> <b>little</b> ashamed then. But {{it was to}} save Tom. In the morning, when I {{explained}} it, {{we would}} have a good laugh over it together.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ail nothing," [...] {{replied the}} learned rival of the {{philosophical}} Syrus; [...] "Nothing--and yet <b>I</b> <b>do</b> feel <b>a</b> <b>little</b> giddy. <b>I</b> could taste a glass of your dame's aqua mirabilis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, boys, I have no {{objection}} to your going out," [...] he said. [...] "I know you all understand the use of firearms, and I know, also, that your fathers loved to go out in their day and hunt. And <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit in that line myself," [...] and he smiled faintly. [...] "But I want you to be very careful in what you shoot at; and do your level best to keep out of trouble of all kinds," [...] and he looked at Jack and Fred as he uttered the latter words.|$|E
60|$|I suppose <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{exceed the}} {{established}} tradition of courts by asking several questions {{and trying to}} get him to talk upon certain points as to which I was curious, but I perceived that he had had to carry on at least so much of the regal tradition as to control the conversation. He was, however, entirely un-posed. His talk reminded me somehow of Maurice Baring's books; it had just the same quick, positive understanding. And he had just the same detachment from the war as the French generals. He spoke of it--as one might speak of an inundation. And of its difficulties and perplexities.|$|E
60|$|Pala. [Aside.] O Jupiter! what a {{blockhead}} was I, {{not to find}} it out! my wife, {{that must}} be, is his mistress. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> suspect it before. Well, I must marry her, because she's handsome, and because I hate to be disinherited by a younger brother, which I am sure I shall be, if I disobey; and yet I must keep in with Rhodophil, because I love his wife.--[To RHO.] I must desire you to make my excuse to your lady, if I have been so unfortunate to cause any mistake; and, withal, to beg the honour of being known to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "As your Eminence pleases," [...] I {{answered}} coolly, [...] "albeit methinks {{that for}} {{one who has}} shed his blood for France as freely as <b>I</b> have <b>done,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> clemency were not unfitting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon you're right; but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> get <b>a</b> <b>little</b> rattled {{when his}} boss asked me where he was. I'll come back this way when it's {{time to go}} to supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew as much! I knew as much! And {{yet he is}} easy, Greenly!--nay, even seems happy. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> feel <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{hope that}} this absence from {{suffering}} might be a favourable omen." ...|$|R
