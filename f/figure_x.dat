For by it we have a very good instance of the curiosity of Nature in another kind of Animals which are remov'd, by reason of their minuteness, beyond the reach of our eyes, so that as there are several sorts of Insects, as Mites, and others, so small as not yet to have had any names; (some of which I shall afterwards describe) and small Fishes, as Leeches in Vineger; and smal vegetables, as Moss, and Rose-Leave-plants; and small Mushroms, as mould: so are there, it seems, small Shel-fish likewise, Nature shewing her curiosity in every Tribe of Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals.|$|E

That is, the blunt end B for a pretty breadth, namely, {{as far as the}} Ring CCC seemed irregularly flawed with divers clefts, which all seemed to tend towards the Center of it, being, as I afterwards found, and shall anon shew in the description of the figure Y, the Basis, as it were, of a Cone, which was terminated a little above the middle of the drop, {{all the rest of the}} Surface from CCC to A was flawed with an infinite number of small and parallel Rings, which as they were for the most part very round, so were they very thick and close together, but were not so exactly flaw'd as to make a perfect Ring, but each circular part was by irregular cracks flawed likewise into multitudes of irregular flakes or tiles; and this order was observed likewise the whole length of the neck.|$|E

60|$|Having {{a pretty}} large {{corner of the}} Plate for the seven Starrs, void, for the filling it up, I have added one small Specimen of the {{appearance}} of the parts of the Moon, by describing a small spot of it, which, though taken notice of, both by the Excellent Hevelius, and called Mons Olympus (though I think somewhat improperly, being rather a vale) and represented by the <b>Figure</b> <b>X.</b> of the 38. Scheme, and also by the Learn'd Ricciolus, who calls it Hipparchus, and describes it by the Figure Y, yet how far short both of them come of the truth, may be somewhat perceiv'd by the draught, which I have here added of it, in the Figure Z, (which I drew by a thirty foot Glass, in October 1664. just before the Moon was half inlightned) but much better by the Reader's diligently observing it himself, at a convenient time, with a Glass of that length, and much better yet with one of threescore foot long, for through these it appears a very spacious Vale, incompassed with a ridge of Hills, not very high in comparison of many other in the Moon, nor yet very steep. The Vale it self ABCD, is much of the figure of a Pear, and from several appearances of it, seems to be some very fruitful place, that is, to have its surface all covered over with some kinds of vegetable substances; for in all positions of the light on it, it seems to give a much fainter reflection then the more barren tops of the incompassing Hills, and those a much fainter then divers other cragged, chalky, or rocky Mountains of the Moon. So that I am not unapt to think, that the Vale may have Vegetables analogus to our Grass, Shrubs, and Trees; and most of these incompassing Hills may be covered with so thin a vegetable Coat, as we may observe the Hills with us to be, such as the short Sheep pasture which covers the Hills of Salisbury Plains.|$|E
60|$|Section 61. The liver is {{the most}} {{complicated}} gland in the body (<b>Figure</b> <b>X.).</b> The bile duct (b.d.) branches again and again, and ends at last in the final pits, the lobuli (lb.), which are lined with secretory epithelium, and tightly packed, and squeeze each other into polygonal forms. The blood supply from which the bile {{would appear to be}} mainly extracted, is brought by the portal vein, but this blood is altogether unfit for the nutrition of the liver tissue; for this latter purpose a branch of the coeliac artery, the hepatic serves. Hence in the tissue of the liver we have, branching and interweaving among the lobuli, the small branches of the bile duct (b.d.), which carries away the bile formed, the portal vein (p.v.), the hepatic artery (h.a.), and the hepatic vein (h.v.). (Compare Section 45.) Figure X.b shows a lobule; the portal vein and the artery ramify round the lobules-- are inter-lobular, that is (inter, between); the hepatic vein begins {{in the middle of the}} lobules (intra-lobular), and receives their blood. (Compare X.a.) Besides its function in the manufacture of the excretory, digestive, and auxiliary bile, the liver performs other duties. It appears to act as an inspector of the assimilation material brought in by the portal vein. The villi, for instance, will absorb arsenic, but this is arrested and thrown down in the liver. A third function is the formation of what would seem to be a store of carbo-hydrate, glycogen, mainly it would appear, from the sugar in the portal vein, though also, very probably, from nitrogenous material, though this may occur only under exceptional conditions. Finally, the nitrogenous katastates, formed in the working of muscle and nerve, and returned by them to the blood for excretion, are not at that stage in the form of urea. Whatever form they assume, they undergo a further metabolism into urea before leaving the body, and the presence of considerable quantities of this latter substance in the liver suggests this as a fourth function of this organ-- the elaboration of urea.|$|E
6000|$|The Instrument {{consisted}} of five Rulers, or long pieces placed [...] together, after the manner exprest {{in the second}} Figure of the first [...] Scheme, where AB denotes a straight piece of wood about six foot and [...] two inches long, about three inches over, and an inch and half thick, [...] {{on the back side}} of which was hung a small plummet by a line stretcht [...] from top to bottom, by which this piece was set exactly upright, and so [...] very firmly fixt; {{in the middle of this}} was made a hole or center, into [...] which one end of a hollow cylindrical brass Box CC, fashion'd as I [...] shall by and by describe, was plac'd, and could very easily and truly [...] be mov'd to and fro; the other end of this Box being put into, and [...] moving in, a hole made in a small arm DD; into this box was fastned the [...] long Ruler EF, about three foot and three or four inches long, and at [...] three foot from the above mention'd Centers PP was a hole E, cut [...] through, and cross'd with two small threads, and at the end of it was [...] fixt a small sight G, and on the back side of it was fixt a small Arm [...] H, with a Screw to fix it in any place on the Ruler LM; this Ruler LM [...] was mov'd on the Center B (which was exactly three foot distance from [...] the middle Center P) and a line drawn through the middle of it LM, was [...] divided by a Line of cords into some sixty degrees, and each degree was [...] subdivided into minutes, so that putting the cross of the threads in E [...] upon any part of this divided line, I presently knew what Angle the two [...] Rules AB and EF made with each other, and by turning the Screw in H, I [...] could fix them in any position. The other Ruler also RS was made much [...] after the same manner, only it was not fixt to the hollow cylindrical [...] Box, but, by means of two small brass Armes or Ears, it mov'd on the [...] Centers of it; this also, by means of the cross threads in the hole S, [...] and by a Screw in K, could be fastned on any division of another line [...] of cords of the same radius drawn on NO. And so by that means, the [...] Angle made by the two Rulers, AB and RS, was also known. The Brass box [...] CC in the middle was shap'd very much like the <b>Figure</b> <b>X,</b> that is, it [...] was a cylindrical Box stopp'd close at either end, off of which a part [...] both of the sides and bottomes was cut out, so that the Box, when the [...] Pipe and that was joyned to it, would contain the Water when fill'd [...] half full, and would likewise, without running over, indure to be [...] inclin'd to an Angle, equal to that of the greatest refraction of [...] Water, and no more, without running over. The Ruler EF was fixt very [...] fast to the Pipe V, so that the Pipe V directed the length of the Ruler [...] EF, and the Box and Ruler were mov'd on the Pin TT, so as to make any [...] desirable Angle with the Ruler AB. The bottom of this Pipe V was stop'd [...] with a small piece of exactly plain Glass, which was plac'd exactly [...] perpendicular to the Line of direction, or Axis of the Ruler EF. The [...] Pins also TT were drill'd with small holes through the Axis, and [...] through those holes was stretcht and fastned a small Wire. There was [...] likewise a small Pipe of Tin loosly put on upon the end of V, and [...] reaching down to the sight G; the use of which was only to keep any [...] false Rayes of light from passing through the bottom of V, and only [...] admitting such to pass as pierced through the sight G: All things being [...] placed together in the manner describ'd in the Figure; that is, the [...] Ruler AB being fixt perpendicular, I fill'd the Box CC with Water, or [...] any other Liquor, whose refraction I intended to try, till the Wire [...] passing through the middle of it were just covered: then I moved and [...] fixt the Ruler FE at any assignable Angle, and placed the flame of a [...] Candle just against the sight G; and looking through the sight I, I [...] moved the Ruler RS to and fro, till I perceived the light passing [...] through G to be covered, as 'twere, or divided by the dark Wire passing [...] through PP: then turning the Screw in K, I fixt it in that posture: And [...] through the hole S, I observed what degree and part of it was cut by [...] the cross threads in S. And this gave me the Angle of Inclination, APS [...] answering to the Angle of Refraction BPE: for the surface of the Liquor [...] in the Box will be alwayes horizontal, and consequently AB will be a [...] perpendicular to it; the Angle therefore APS will measure, or be the [...] Angle of Inclination in the Liquor; next EPB must be the Angle of [...] Refraction, for the Ray that passes through the sight G, passes also [...] perpendicularly through the Glass Diaphragme at F, and consequently [...] also perpendicularly through the lower surface of the Liquor contiguous [...] to the Glass, and therefore suffers no refraction till it meet with the [...] horizontal surface of the Liquor in CC, which is determined by the two [...] Angles.|$|E
