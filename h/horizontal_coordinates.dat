50|$|The <b>horizontal</b> <b>coordinate</b> {{system is}} a {{celestial}} coordinate system that uses the observer's local horizon as the fundamental plane. It is {{expressed in terms of}} altitude (or elevation) angle and azimuth.|$|R

50|$|In {{traditional}} stereo vision, two cameras, displaced horizontally {{from one}} another are used to obtain two differing views on a scene, {{in a manner similar}} to human binocular vision. By comparing these two images, the relative depth information can be obtained in the form of a disparity map, which encodes the difference in <b>horizontal</b> <b>coordinates</b> of corresponding image points.

5000|$|<b>Horizontal</b> <b>coordinates</b> {{are very}} useful for {{determining}} the rise and set times of an object in the sky. When an object's altitude is 0°, {{it is on the}} horizon. If at that moment its altitude is increasing, it is rising, but if its altitude is decreasing, it is setting. However, all objects on the celestial sphere are subject to diurnal motion, which is always from east to west.

50|$|This {{configuration}} {{is that of}} a time projection chamber (TPC); {{it allows}} three-dimensional reconstruction of the interaction site, since the depth coordinate (z) can be measured very accurately from the time separation between the two light pulses. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>coordinates</b> can be reconstructed from the hit pattern in the photomultiplier array(s). Critically for WIMP searches, the ratio between the two response channels (scintillation and ionisation) allows the rejection of the predominant backgrounds for WIMP searches: gamma and beta radiation from trace radioactivity in detector materials and the immediate surroundings. WIMP candidate events produce lower ionisation/scintillation ratios than the more prevalent background interactions.|$|E
