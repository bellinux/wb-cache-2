2500|$|The {{landside}} is {{the flat}} plate which presses against and transmits the lateral {{thrust of the}} plough bottom to the furrow wall. It helps to resist the side pressure exerted by the furrow slice on the mouldboard. It also helps in stabilizing the plough while it is in operations. The rear bottom end of the landslide, which rubs against the furrow sole, is known as heel [...] A heel iron is bolted {{to the end of}} the rear of the landside and helps to carry the back of the plough. The landside and share are arranged to give a ‘'lead” towards the unploughed land, thus helping to maintain the correct furrow width. The landside is usually made of solid medium carbon steel, and is very short except on the rear bottom of the plow. The heel or rear end of the rear landside may be subject to excessive wear if the rear wheel is out of adjustment, therefore, a chilled iron <b>heel</b> <b>piece</b> is frequently used. This heel is inexpensive and can be easily replaced. The land side is fastened to the frog with the help of plough bolts.|$|E
50|$|A {{major upgrade}} was {{released}} in 1981 as the M40 Racing series. This is perhaps one of their best known bindings {{as it was a}} regular feature on the racing circuit through the 1980s. This featured an updated version of the M4 toe and an entirely new <b>heel</b> <b>piece</b> with a push-button release. Another major update followed in 1985 in the M46. This introduced the Twin-Cam toe and a Salomon-like lever-release heel. This basic design has remained the pattern for Marker bindings to this day.|$|E
5000|$|At {{an early}} age Stevens was {{entrusted}} by his father with the family business affairs, and in 1821 {{at the age of}} 26 he assumed full responsibility for the Stevens estate in Hoboken and other properties. Also in 1821, he developed the [...] "Stevens plow," [...] a cast-iron plow with a curved moldboard and replaceable <b>heel</b> <b>piece.</b> The plow was popular among New Jersey farmers. He went on to design many other technological innovations, such as the “twohorse dump wagon” for New York City; the [...] "closed fireroom” system of forced draft for his family's steamboat fleet; and the [...] "vestibule car" [...] for the Camden and Amboy Railroad.|$|E

40|$|The four Cichlidogyrus species (Monogenea, Ancyrocephalidae) {{found on}} the gills of Sarotherodon mvogoi and Tylochromis sudanensis (Teleostei, Cichlidae) in Cameroon are {{considered}} new and are described herein. Cichlidogyrus mvogoi n. sp. from Sarotherodon mvogoi, characterised by a long (> 100 mu m), thin and spirally coiled penis and a short marginal hook pair I. Cichlidogyrus sigmocirrus n. sp. from Tylochromis sudanensis, characterised by a short marginal hook pair I, a slightly spirally coiled penis with reduced <b>heel,</b> an accessory <b>piece</b> being a spirally coiled band wrapped round the penis and attached to the penis basal bulb by a very thin filament. Cichlidogyrus chrysopiformis n. sp. from Tylochromis sudanensis, characterised by an marginal hook pair I of medium size, a thin spirally coiled penis (1. 5 turn) with a developed flared <b>heel,</b> an accessory <b>piece</b> being a large gutter shaped band, ending in a narrow complex extremity, and linked to the basal bulb of the penis by a very thin filament, a short, straight and slightly ringed vagina. Cichlidogyrus djietoi n. sp. from Tylochromis sudanensis, characterised by a slightly spirally coiled penis (2 turns) with developed <b>heel,</b> an accessory <b>piece</b> being a large gutter shaped band, ending in a narrow folded back extremity, a short funnel shaped vagina. The three latter species are also remarkable by the morphology of their auricles implanted on the anterior side of the dorsal transverse bar which make them (together with the other species described from Tylochromis hosts) a homogeneous and original group within Cichlidogyrus, this distinctive feature seems to be ancestral compared to other Cichlidogyrus species...|$|R
50|$|The score, which Almodóvar did not like, was {{composed}} by Ryuichi Sakamoto. For the title sequence and Rebeca's second confession in High <b>Heels,</b> Almodóvar used <b>pieces</b> composed by Miles Davis in the Sixties, that {{were inspired by}} Flamenco. The first piece, heard while Rebeca is alone waiting for her mother, is called Solea, meaning solitude in Andalusian. After her second confession to judge Dominguez, when Rebeca goes to the cemetery to throw a handful of earth on her husband's coffin, we hear the second piece, Saeta, by Gil Evans, from his Sketches of Spain.|$|R

5000|$|Being wood, clogs cannot flex {{under the}} ball of the foot as softer shoes do. To allow the foot to roll forward most clogs have {{the bottom of the}} toe curved up, known as the cast. Some styles of clogs have [...] "feet", such as Spanish albarca. The clog rotates around the front edge of the front [...] "feet". Japanese and Indian clogs may have [...] "teeth" [...] or very high pegs {{attached}} to the soles. The clog can rotate around the front edge of the front [...] "tooth" [...] as the wearer strides forward. Some medieval pattens were in two <b>pieces,</b> <b>heel</b> through to ball and ball to toes. Joining the two was a leather strip forming a hinge, thus allowing the shoe above to flex.|$|R
