The monochromatic light from an <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>source</b> does not work well with color displays, however.

The aim was to design a lamp using an <b>electroluminescent</b> light <b>source,</b> and making it playful and engaging. The designers aimed to create an object that addresses different forms of physical interaction and the resulting lamp invites the user to play and interact with the light within a three-dimensional space. Moving the strands of light changes {{the quality of the}} light itself, giving a stronger illumination when the strands are together, and a more diffuse ambient glow when they are apart. The strands of light stay in the position they were set, so the lamp retains a physical memory of the interaction creating a time-based dialogue between the user and the space through manipulating the object; these physical gestures turn the users into designers of their space...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multi-functional operational diagnostic lab-on-foil analysis system integrating electrical and optical devices by polytronic means. This functional polymer-opto-electronic module is completely integrated on a foil substrate, where an <b>electroluminescent</b> light <b>source</b> has been hetero-integrated {{together with an}} organic thin-film field-effect transistor (OTFT), working as a photodetector. This module is combined with a microfluidic channel also machined in plastics to form an optical detection system for analysis of fluids. The different components are fabricated on a PEN film substrate with coating and patterning steps, resulting in direct integration of the different functionalities without any assembly steps. Therefore a very cost-efficient way of fabricating such a module is achieved. Furthermore the use of plastic films as substrate opens the way to low-cost manufacturing with roll-to-roll processing. The module demonstrates {{in this way the}} capabi lities of polytronics in functional integration for low-cost manufacturing...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on a novel device that {{addresses}} the needs for an efficient, field deployable and disposable system {{in the field of}} bio-chemical sensors using organic semiconductors. The Fraunhofer Institute has enabled a complete roll-to-roll manufactured polymer-opto-chemical-electronic module on a foil substrate, wherein an <b>electroluminescent</b> light <b>source</b> has been hetero-integrated together with an organic TFT, working as a photo-detector. A chemically sensitive, colour changing film is sandwiched in between the two elements to form an optical detection system for volatile analytes such as amines. The setup, henceforth referred to as the "PolyOpto" module, comprises of a dye coated layer that can detect specific chemical reactions by colour change inserted in between the EL light source and the OTFT photo-detector. A hole is laser cut through the system to allow the sensor layer to come in contact with the gases, which then through a chemical reaction, chang es colour and initiates a different response in the output of the organic transistor. Hence, this allows for a disposable chemo-analytical system {{that can be used in}} various application fields. As compared to conventional systems, the advantage here lies in the direct integration of the different functionalities without any advanced assembly steps, simultaneous use of coatings for both components (transparent electrode and wiring layer) and roll-to-roll compatibility, thus rendering a disposable system. We believe that it aptly demonstrates the capabilities of polytronics in functional integration for low-cost bio-sensor manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{condensed}} matter, THz optical resonances (1 − 5 THz) {{are very}} sensitive to thermally activated phenomena that can either equate the populations between the levels or irremediably broaden the transition to a point where it disappears. It is therefore very difficult to exploit THz electronic transitions for thermal emission. To bypass this problem, we have used a transition in the mid-infrared (10 − 50 THz), ultrastrongly coupled to a resonant mode of a highly subwavelength microcavity. The coupling strength in our system reaches 90 % of the energy of the matter resonance and becomes so high that the lower-polariton state lies in the THz region. This mixed light−matter resonance is therefore issued from an optical transition that is much less sensitive to thermal effects, as we have experimentally demonstrated. Our system has been optimized by tailoring the cavity thickness and engineering the matter resonance, which arises from a set of heavily doped quantum wells, in order to increase the THz emissivity. By injecting a lateral current in the quantum wells that raises the electronic temperature, we have observed THz emission up to room temperature. U ltrastrong light−matter coupling is a regime of quantum electrodynamics that occurs when the light−matter coupling energy E R is of the same order of magnitude as the matter excitation energy. 1 Similarly to the case of strong coupling regime, the eigenstates of the system, the polaritons, are mixed states involving a matter and a photonic part. 2 In the ultrastrong configuration, however, a wide gap opens up in the polaritonic dispersion 3 that compresses the lower polariton branch at very low energy, as it is illustrated in Figure 1 a. The ultrastrong coupling allows us therefore {{to take advantage of a}} robust matter resonance in the mid-infrared spectrum (100 − 200 meV) to generate a polaritonic mode in the THz region (15 − 25 meV), almost 1 order of magnitude lower. Note that, in the limit of E R equal to the matter excitation, the lower polariton (LP) vanishes and only the upper polariton (UP) survives. 4 In this work we have exploited this property to demonstrate a quasi-monochromatic THz incandescent source. Our device does not need to be cooled, as opposed to usual THz <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>sources.</b> The resonance at THz frequencies arises from the ultrastrong coupling of a mid-infrared collective excitation, 4 in a doped semiconductor layer, known as Berreman mode, 5 with a plasmonic microcavity mode. The incandescent emission is excited by a current flowing in the semiconductor layer and then extracted from the top surface by a metallic grating. Our device architecture presents three main advantages with respect to THz incandescent devices existing in the literature. First of all, only the absorbing medium is heated, 6, 7 thus, allowing a faster frequency modulation of the incandescence compared to systems in which the entire structure is heated. 8 − 10 The second advantage resides in the fact that our device is based on a robust mid-infrared collective mode, instead of a single particle THz excitation. 11 This has an important consequence on the robustness in temperature of the material resonance. Indeed a collective mode has a harmonic oscillator spectrum, which cannot be saturated when increasing the temperature, as opposed to the case of a two level system. Furthermore, the collective mode is issued from the excitation of an electron gas with Fermi energy much larger than k B T: the electronic distribution is thus almost unaffected by the temperature. The third advantage of our device is the fact that the photonic structure operates as a microcavity and also as an antenna, thus ensuring a good coupling of the polariton modes with the free space. 12, 13 A sketch of our device is illustrated in Figure 1 b. In Figure 1 c, one can see a scanning electron microscope (SEM) picture of...|$|R
40|$|Indium-tin oxide (ITO) is {{commonly}} used as the transparent electrode in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. ITO's transparent properties {{come at the expense}} of less than ideal electrode characteristics arising from insulating over-oxidized surface species. OPVs fabricated on the native ITO surface tend to exhibit poor performance with a high degree of variability from device to device. Aggressive acid etching of the ITO surface removes the majority of the insulating surface species leading to improvements in OPV efficiency with greater reproducibility and increased device to device consistency. Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) are planar <b>electroluminescent</b> light <b>sources</b> that naturally couple a portion of their emission into internally reflected modes within the device substrate. Although this coupling property is well known, few attempts have been made to integrate OLEDs as light sources for internal reflection elements. Furthermore, OPVs share the optical coupling properties of OLEDs and therefore can be used as integrated internal reflection detectors. Integrating both an OLED light source and an OPV detector onto the same substrate results in an internal reflection sensing platform that requires no free-space optics, has low power consumption requirements, and can be easily fabricated on substrates occupying an area less than one square inch. In this work we establish a functional prototype design, characterize the fundamental coupling properties, and demonstrate several surface sensing responses of this fully integrated optical sensing platform. The net solar power production from OPVs arises from the interactions between multiple currents through the device. The photocurrent is the only power producing current in the device and understanding the voltage dependent nature of this current is essential in OPV research. Analysis methods of conventional, inorganic photovoltaics do not adequately describe the photocurrent behavior commonly observed in OPVs. OPV analysis is therefore somewhat limited by the methods commonly employed. To improve upon the convention methods we develop a simplified method of OPV photocurrent analysis based on electrochemical methods that accurately describes the voltage dependence of the photocurrent and leads to greater insight into the key parameters involved in solar power production from OPVs...|$|R
40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} pose {{a serious}} threat to global health. Molecular diagnostics provide solutions for effective control and prevention of infections, however suffers from expensive laboratory equipment, and infrastructure to be fully implemented at point of care (POC), especially at low-resource settings. Lab-on-a-chip that aims to integrate complex biochemical analyses into automated systems is promising for POC analysis. A major challenge is the integration of a complete molecular diagnostic assay, generally translating into complex microfluidics, with the requirement of low fabrication cost. This thesis explores the use of flexible electronics, plastic foils and roll-to-roll manufacturing to enable low-cost microfluidic systems, for molecular diagnostic assays especially targeted towards infectious diseases. Many biochemical assays rely on heat; hence a first aspect in this thesis is the integration of a microheater into microfluidics. In a first project a system for SNP-genotyping is presented using solid phase melting curve analysis to discriminate mutations at a single base resolution. Starting with a glass based concept (paper I) which is further developed to a foil based system (paper II), detection of the polymorphism in the neuropeptide Y associated with increased risk of type II diabetes is demonstrated as a proof of principle. Further development and optimization of the microheater concept has enabled roll-to-roll manufacturing compatibility and multiplexing of targets (paper III). A bacterial sub-typing and multiresistance detection in clinical Staphylococcus Aureus samples is demonstrated for applications in infectious diseases diagnostics. Finally, the microheater concept is further developed to enable μPCR (paper IV). Detection of genomic HIV- 1 is demonstrated and a portable detection setup based on an LED light source and low cost CMOS camera for detection was developed. A second aspect of this thesis is integration of light sources and optical detection (paper V-VI). A multilayer system integrating an <b>electroluminescent</b> light <b>source,</b> reactive sensor dyes and organic semiconductor transistor for detection is demonstrated. The system could be used for amine detection in gases (paper V). System was made further roll-to-roll compatible. The system uses an external LED light source and a photodetector processed in only one screen printing- and one dispensing step (paper VI). As a proof of principle, absorbance based DNA hybridization was detected. Collectively, roll-to-roll manufacturing compatible “lab on foil” systems have the potential to improve our ability to diagnose at POC especially at resource-limited settings. QC 20170426 </p...|$|R
30|$|LEDs are an <b>electroluminescent</b> {{semiconductor}} light <b>source</b> with ubiquitous {{applications and}} {{a rapidly growing}} market. Typical length scales of LED structures range from hundreds of nanometers to a few micrometers, making it {{a good fit for}} soft nanoimprint lithography for high yield, high throughput and low cost fabrication. However, this is also a good fit for low cost optical lithography, so most nanoimprint lithography work has been on improving the performance of LEDs through the incorporation of nanoscale patterning. For example, many groups have demonstrated the integration of photonic crystals on top of LEDs by nanoimprint lithography, improving light output by as much as 25  % [10, 44, 45]. To limit etching damage, Truong et al. directly imprinted titanium oxide photonic crystals using sol gel titania as an imprint resist with a soft poly[(3 -mercaptopropyl) methylsiloxane] (PMMS) mold specifically designed to allow solvent diffusion through the mold during the curing process [46]. Nanoimprint lithography has also been demonstrated as a low cost method to extend the benefits of patterned sapphire substrates to the nanoscale [47, 48]. Typically, LEDs consist of a nitride semiconductor layer on a sapphire substrate. Patterned sapphire substrates improve the efficiency of LEDs by two mechanisms. First, optimal patterning can reduce the defect density due to the lattice mismatch between the sapphire substrate and the nitride layer [49]. Second, the patterned interface scatters emitted light, reducing reflected light which is typically absorbed by the electrode [50]. Nanoscale PSS have been shown to have improved enhancement in output power over microscale PSS due to further improved scattering effects [51]. Texturing the electrode surfaces is another approach to reducing scattering losses at other interfaces within the LED structure [52]. While many approaches to electrode patterning rely on unpatterned etching, nanoimprint lithography introduces the potential for low cost pattern transfer of designed templates for optimal performance [53, 54]. One specific example of this is shown in Fig.  4 II [38].|$|R
