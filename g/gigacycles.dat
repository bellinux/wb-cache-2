40|$|IN {{microwave}} {{work one}} of the valuable and inherently appealing test instruments is the microwave sweep generator. Such generators can greatly simplify difficult microwave investigations, as discussed in several past articles ' on sweepfrequency techniques. A new series of microwave sweep oscillators has now been designed which incorporates {{a number of new}} conveniences. These oscillators, especially when used with some of the advanced High resolution microwove components developed in the-hplaboratoriesz, make sweep methods more accurate and more than ever. The new sweepers collectively cover the fre-quency range from 1 to 40 <b>gigacycles</b> (kilomegacycles). A major factor in their convenience derives from their use of a p-i-n diode type modulator in the output circuits s of those generators covering the 1 to 12. 4 Gc region. This type of modulator permits the generators to be modulated or leveled with virtually no reaction on the generated carrier frequency, since the voltages and currents in the oscillator tube remain constant. As a result, more accurate frequency specifications are possible in all operating functions...|$|E

All of these applica tions are characterized by the need for good short- and long-term stability as well as low residual f-m noise over a wide spectrum about the operating frequency. To meet these stability demands,-hp-'s Dymec division has developed a versatile frequency-stabilizing instrument that gives high stability to typical microwave frequency sources. The instrument is a synchronizer which phase locks a reflex klystron to a de sired frequency between 1 and 12. 4 <b>gigacycles.</b> The frequency is a harmonic (Â ± the i-f fre quency) of a crystal oscillator in the Synchron izer, and the klystron, when so controlled, pro vides a signal virtually as stable and spectrally pure as the rf crystal reference itself.
