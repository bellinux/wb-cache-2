In the paper, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} the multiple-criteria {{estimation}} of the alternatives of an innovative technology (equipment) for their comparison, ranking, and selection of the best under conditions when {{a part of the}} parameters of alternative efficiency may be fuzzy. The method is based on linear programming; and the parameters of efficiency influence the results of calculations through the objective function and certain limitations. One seeks for the best option of ranking of the alternatives by means of the artificial creation and gradual magnification of competition between them, where each "argues" by the complete set of its performance parameters. The essence of the proposed method is illustrated by the example of alternatives of a <b>down</b> hole <b>pump</b> <b>unit</b> for the rise of oil reservoir fluid. We have developed the mathematical model and its implementation in MS Excel. These tools enable the decision-maker, who does not have the corresponding expertise, to become a leading participant in the process of selecting the best technologies and to make his own choice consciously. The model has a hierarchical structure. The problem is solved in an analytical way; we give the computational formulae for the practical application of our model, which is explained on some specific examples. The model can be used for multiple-criteria comparison of any objects of the same purpose with known parameters of efficiency (utility), in particular, at selecting the best option for an innovation and investment project. ????????? ????? ??????????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ????????????? ??????????

As a special case, Russian gas pumping system has the longest pipes with large diameter, which carry great amounts of natural gas. So, as reconstruction and modernization needs large investments, a need of more effective and low cost tool appeared. As a result diagnostics became the most wide-spread method for lifecycle assessment, and lifecycle extension for gas <b>pumping</b> <b>units</b> and pipelines. One of the most effective method for diagnostics of gas <b>pumping</b> <b>units</b> is parametric diagnostics. It is based on evaluation of measurement of several termo-gas dynamic parameters of gas <b>pumping</b> <b>units,</b> such as pressures, temperatures and rotational speed of turbines and compressors. In my work I developed and examined a special case of parametric diagnostics – methodic for evaluation of technical state and output parameters for gas <b>pumping</b> <b>unit</b> “Ural- 16 ”.

30|$|The {{conventional}} <b>pumping</b> <b>units</b> {{were selected}} as the basic model to redesign the lower barbell <b>pumping</b> <b>units</b> with keeping the original structure, and a rigid lower barbell device was added at the tail of beam.

Due to the reasonable configuration for the position and the quality of lower barbell, the beam balance torque can balance the polished torque better than the conventional <b>pumping</b> <b>units.</b> Therefore, the torque of gearbox decreased and was smooth more than before (Zhu et al. 2009).|$|R
