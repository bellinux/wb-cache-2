40|$|<b>In-mold</b> {{assembly}} is {{a promising}} process for producing articulated joints. It utilizes injection molding to automate assembly operations, which may otherwise require high labor times for production. Since injection molding {{is a high}} throughput process, <b>in-mold</b> assembly holds considerable promise in bulk production of assembled parts. However, current <b>in-mold</b> assembly methods cannot be used for manufacturing <b>in-mold</b> assembled products at the mesoscale. This is because the process changes considerably when the sizes of the molded parts are reduced. The premolded component in a mesoscale joint consists of miniature features. Hence, when a high temperature, high pressure polymer melt is injected on top of it, it is susceptible to plastic deformation. Due to presence of a mesoscale premolded component which is susceptible to deformation, traditional shrinkage models alone {{can not be used}} to characterize and control the clearances. This dissertation identifies and addresses issues pertaining to <b>in-mold</b> assembly of revolute joints at the mesoscale. First, this dissertation identifies defect modes which are unique to <b>in-mold</b> assembly at the mesoscale. Then it develops mold design templates which can be used for manufacturing <b>in-mold</b> assembled mesoscale revolute joints. Further, issues related to the deformation of the mesoscale premolded component are identified. Two novel mold design solutions to realize mesoscale <b>in-mold</b> assembled revolute joints are presented. The first involves use of mold inserts to constrain the premolded component to inhibit its deformation. The second involves use of a bi-directional flow of the polymer melt over the premolded component to balance the deforming forces experienced by it. Finally, methods to predict and control clearances that would be obtained in mesoscale <b>in-mold</b> assembled revolute joints are presented. To demonstrate the utility of the tools built as part of this research effort, a case study of a miniature robotic application built using mesoscale <b>in-mold</b> assembly methods is presented.

40|$|To reduce {{secondary}} processing such as sanding or chemical etching {{in the manufacture}} of composite structures, we present an <b>in-mold</b> surface preparation process using imprint lithography on carbon/epoxy composite adhesive joints. In the proposed <b>in-mold</b> process, microstructures are designed and fabricated {{on the surface of the}} mold to form composites. Through the formation of composites on the mold at an appropriate temperature and pressure, the shapes of the microstructures are imprinted onto the surface of the composite.

In this paper, concavo-convex microstructures were fabricated on the surface of carbon/epoxy composites using <b>in-mold</b> surface preparation, which improved the apparent mode I fracture toughness of the composite/adhesive interface.

In view of the shortcoming of soft-sensor and the existing hardware-based sensors for process monitoring, a capacitive transducer as an alternative hardware sensor has been developed for <b>in-mold</b> monitoring.

In this project, it is further demonstrated that this sensor can on-line predict the <b>in-mold</b> part weight effectively. Experiments under various conditions show that the proposed on-line weight prediction is robust and effective. It paves the way for on-line closed-loop part weight control. The application of the <b>in-mold</b> capacitive transducer is also extended for on-line check-ring failure detection for injection molding. Considering the limitation of the set of mold embedded solely with the capacitive transducer, a completely new set of hot-sprue mold fitted with additional commercial sensors and controlled gating option is specially designed. In that way, the performance of the capacitive transducer for process monitoring is again verified. In addition, the solidification status of the polymer melt and the <b>in-mold</b> part detachment can be potentially monitored by the capacitive transducer.

The neoteric Resin Infusion between Double Flexible Tooling (RIDFT) process is undergoing modifications to improve its cost-effectiveness by developing methodologies for <b>in-mold</b> coating and the incorporation of UV curing. <b>In-mold</b> coating is desired by the composites industry since it eliminates the current paint process, which is not only laborious and time consuming, but expensive, and presents safety issues.

The joining of two {{components}} {{by the process}} of injection molding is state of the art, although adhesion phenomena are not fully understood yet. The formation of bonds between a cold material, which was inserted or applied onto the surface of the cavity before injection molding, and an injected polymer melt is studied in this work. Providing sufficient bond strength, the material is transferred {{from the surface of the}} mold to the injection molded part. Possibly influencing factors on the bond strength are first identified, theoretically discussed, later in experiments varied and finally analyzed. Thereby correlating tendencies between different polymers and different <b>in-mold</b> technologies are observed. The relevant material and processing parameters are put in order by their influence on the bond strength using design of experiments. This helps to understand the mechanisms of the formation of bonds. The majority of the experiments is concerned with two component injection molding by measuring the bond strength of two component tensile bars, produced under varying processing conditions. In each case, first and second components are made of the same thermoplastic polymer. The thermal energy of the melt can be used also to initiate chemical reactions. This permits bonding of a thin layer of a functional polymer, which is applied onto the surface of the mold before injecting the melt, to the surface of the molded part. In this way, process-integrated surface modification during injection molding becomes possible. In a further attempt, patterns of paint are printed onto the surface of the mold by pad printing.

40|$|Plastic {{products}} such as toys with articulated arms, legs, and heads are traditionally produced by first molding individual components separately, and then assembling them together. A recent alternative, referred to as <b>in-mold</b> assembly process, performs molding and assembly steps concurrently inside the mold itself. The most common technique of performing <b>in-mold</b> assembly is through multi-stage molding, in which the various components of an assembly are injected in a sequence of molding stages to produce the final assembly. Multi-stage molding produces better-quality articulated products at a lower cost. It however, gives rise to new mold design challenges that are absent from traditional molding. We {{need to develop a}} molding plan that determines the mold design parameters and sequence of molding stages. There are currently no software tools available to generate molding plans. It is difficult to perform the planning manually because it involves evaluating large number of combinations and solving complex geometric reasoning problems. This dissertation investigates the problem of generating multi-stage molding plans for articulated assemblies. The multi-stage molding process is studied and the underlying governing principles and constraints are identified. A hybrid planning framework that combines elements from generative and variant techniques is developed. A molding plan representation is developed to build a library of feasible molding plans for basic joints. These molding plans for individual joints are reused to generate plans for new assemblies. As part of this overall planning framework, we need to solve the following geometric subproblems [...] finding assembly configuration that is both feasible and optimal, finding mold-piece regions, and constructing an optimal shutoff surface. Algorithms to solve these subproblems are developed and characterized. This dissertation makes the following contributions. The representation for molding plans provides a common platform for sharing feasible and efficient molding plans for joints. It investigates the multi-stage mold design problem from the planning perspective. The new hybrid planning framework and geometric reasoning algorithms will increase the level of automation and reduce chances of design mistakes.

TiH 2 feedstock, a mixture of binder and powders, was fabricated with critical powder loading of 68 vol. %. The rheological characteristics of the feedstock were investigated for subsequent processing step. Viscosity of the feedstock showed pseudo-plastic flow behavior and to optimize injection molding parameter, <b>in-mold</b> rheology curve was generated. The results indicated that the recycled TiH 2 feedstock can be used for the fabrication of the complex shaped parts with good shape...|$|E
