50|$|The various {{shapes of}} <b>electric</b> <b>arcs</b> are {{emergent}} properties of non-linear patterns {{of current and}} <b>electric</b> field. The <b>arc</b> occurs in the gas-filled space between two conductive electrodes (often made of tungsten or carbon) and it results in a very high temperature, capable of melting or vaporizing most materials. An <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> is a continuous discharge, while the similar electric spark discharge is momentary. An <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> may occur either in direct current (DC) circuits or in alternating current (AC) circuits. In the latter case, the arc may re-strike on each half cycle of the current. An <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> differs from a glow discharge in that the current density is quite high, and the voltage drop within the arc is low; at the cathode, the current density can {{be as high as}} one megaampere per square centimeter.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{steelmaking}} in the <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> furnace is in {{the category}} of the industrial processes with high degree of pollution because in the air environmental factor are transferred the following pollutant substances: volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter, carbon oxides, sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, dioxins and furans.
