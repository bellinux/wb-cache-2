5|$|Tom Pryce's helmet design was, in {{comparison}} to later drivers', simple and restrained. His helmet was plain white all over until 1970. At that year's race at Castle Combe, his father asked Pryce to make his helmet stand out more {{so that he could}} easily identify him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> of cars. Pryce added five black vertical lines to his helmet, placed just above his visor. From that time the only change to this design was the addition of a Welsh flag to the side of his helmet in 1974.|$|E
5|$|While an Australian Cattle Dog {{generally}} works silently, it will bark {{in alarm}} or to attract attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking {{can be a}} sign of boredom or frustration, although research has shown that pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in a noisy environment. It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a pecking order can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> with other dogs.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 28 games {{distributed}} on 11 different game cards were released for the Magnavox Odyssey. 13 games were {{included with the}} console—a set of 12 in America and {{a different set of}} 10 in other countries—with 6 others available for purchase either individually for US$5.49 or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> for US$24.99; the additional games primarily used the same game cards with different screen overlays and instructions. Another game, Percepts, was available for free to players that sent in a survey card. A light gun accessory, Shooting Gallery, was available for purchase, and included four games on two cards that used the rifle. A final four games were released for sale in 1973, designed wholly or in part by Don Emry. The games do not enforce game rules or keep track of score; that is left up to the players.|$|E

5|$|Rare {{released}} a multiplayer map pack, called Perfect Dark Zero Map Pack One, to the Xbox Live Marketplace on June 7, 2006. It contains the demo's new multiplayer map {{as well as}} three other new maps {{to add to the}} game's original six. Unlike the game's default maps, the new maps only have one variant instead of two. On October 31, 2006, Rare announced that a special platinum edition of Perfect Dark Zero would be released, and would include the first map pack and two additional maps. The two new maps were later released for free <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> called Perfect Dark Zero Map Pack Two. These maps are updated versions of two maps from the original Perfect Dark: Felicity and Ruins. The pack was released on November 1, 2006 for Gold Members and on November 8, 2006 for Silver Members.|$|E
5|$|Such a {{depiction}} {{is common}} in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature. Robert T. Bakker has extended social behavior to parental care, and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth and chewed bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to lairs for their young to eat until they were grown, and prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food. However, there is actually little evidence of gregarious behavior in theropods, and social interactions {{with members of the}} same species would have included antagonistic encounters, as shown by injuries to gastralia and bite wounds to skulls (the pathologic lower jaw named Labrosaurus ferox is one such possible example). Such head-biting may have been a way to establish dominance <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> or to settle territorial disputes.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of the second Giro d'Italia began with a large send off in the start city of Milan. The finish in Udine was hotly contested as five riders came {{to the finish line}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pack.</b> Ernesto Azzini managed to out-sprint the other four riders in the leading group to win the stage. The next stage saw the first non-Italian stage winner {{in the history of the}} Giro d'Italia, the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq. Dortignacq managed to {{breakaway}} from his fellow group member Carlo Galetti and then solo to the stage victory while five other riders chased close behind. Galetti's second-place finish on the stage was high enough for him to take the lead of the race. The French success enraged the Italian fans and led the competing riders to ban unite against the foreign riders. The third stage saw three major Italian riders, Luigi Ganna, Carlo Galetti, and Eberardo Pavesi, and attack early on in the stage. The three riders then rode together all the way to the finish in Teramo. Galetti went on to win the stage, with Ganna and Pavesi following in quick succession.|$|E

5|$|The {{golden jackal}} often hunts alone, and {{sometimes}} in pairs, but rarely hunts <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pack.</b> When hunting alone, it trots around an area and occasionally stops to sniff and listen. Once prey is located, the jackal conceals itself, quickly approaches its prey and then pounces on it. Single jackals hunt rodents, hares, and birds. They hunt rodents in grass by locating them with their hearing before leaping {{into the air and}} pouncing on them. In India, they can dig Indian gerbils out from their burrows, and they can hunt young, old, and infirm ungulates up to 4–5 times their body weight. Jackals search for hiding blackbuck calves throughout the day during the calving period. The peak times for their searches are the early morning and the late evening. When hunting in pairs or packs, jackals run parallel to their prey and overtake it in unison. When hunting aquatic rodents or birds, they will run along both sides of narrow rivers or streams and drive their prey from one jackal to another.|$|E
5|$|On {{release of}} Guitar Hero 5, 35 {{of the songs}} from World Tour and 21 from Smash Hits are importable into Guitar Hero 5 for a small fee (approximately $0.10 per song), and are treated as {{downloadable}} content for the game playable in all game modes; the World Tour export was available on release, while the Smash Hits export was available a few days afterwards. Furthermore, 61 of the 65 tracks from Band Hero are importable into Guitar Hero 5. All transferred songs are also playable in Band Hero. However, Guitar Hero 5 is not backwards-compatible with World Tour. The transfer process requires the player to enter a unique code from the World Tour or Smash Hits manual {{to be able to}} redownload available songs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> (on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3) or individual songs (on the Wii) that have been updated to include the new features. Players on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 can delete individual songs after downloading the pack. Some songs are not transferable because of licensing issues—not technical issues—according to Bright. Tim Riley, the head of music licensing at Activision, stated that the company will continue to seek licenses for more songs from previous games and downloadable content to be exported into Guitar Hero 5, but cannot guarantee that these songs will be licensed for future Guitar Hero games. While reviewers appreciated Activision's efforts to allow the importing of songs from previous games, they felt that the small number of tracks that were available at launch was at odds with the impression that Activision had made of the process before the game's release.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, the Bloodhound bay {{is among}} the most {{impressive}} of hound voices. When hunting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> they are expected to be in full cry. They are more likely to 'give tongue,' 'throw their tongue,' or 'speak' when hunting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> than when hunting singly, and more when hunting free than when on the leash. The quality of 'speaking to the line', that is giving tongue when on the correct scent while remaining silent when off it, is valued in British Bloodhound circles, on aesthetic grounds and because it makes it very easy to 'read' the hound's tracking behaviour. As a result, special trophies for speaking to the correct line are on offer at British working trials (where hounds hunt singly), although rarely awarded.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, at Duke University in North Carolina, J. B. Rhine and {{his wife}} Louisa E. Rhine {{conducted}} investigation into extrasensory perception. While Louisa Rhine concentrated on collecting accounts of spontaneous cases, J. B. Rhine worked largely in the laboratory, carefully defining terms such as ESP and psi and designing experiments to test them. A simple set of cards was developed, originally called Zener cards – now called ESP cards. They bear the symbols circle, square, wavy lines, cross, and star; there are five cards of each <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> of 25.|$|E
25|$|Later, in {{the spring}} of '71, Captain William Meade would bring <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> train from Hazelton, and he would make many {{improvements}} on that trail. Despite the fact that these roads were built and improved during the rush years, the trip was still perilous and very costly. Steamer fare on the Fraser River on the Enterprise or the Victoria was $25 and 12.5 cents a pound was added for baggage. Smaller boats near the gold fields charged $7 for the ride and 7 cents a pound for baggage. At Takla Landing, yet more money was required, as that was a road toll that charged 18 cents a pound for baggage.|$|E

40|$|Edmonds and Giles [4] conjectured {{that the}} maximum number of {{directed}} joins <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> is equal to the minimum weight of a directed cut, for any weighted directed graph. This is dual to the Lucchesi-Younger Theorem [10], [9] which proves that {{the maximum number}} of directed cuts <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> is equal to the minimum weight of a directed join, for any weighted directed graph. Schrijver [13], Feoﬁloﬀ and Younger [5], [6] proved that the conjecture does hold for directed graphs with directed paths from every source to every sink.

25|$|Wolves on {{the island}} have, historically, been {{separated}} into three or four packs, with each pack usually having between three and eight members, including two or three pups. The number of wolves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> depends mainly {{on the amount of}} snow that fell in the previous winter. In winters with light snow, pups tend to leave the pack to find mates, so packs run at four or five members; in heavily snowy winters, the pups stay with the pack, which can reach ten to twelve members. If many members of a pack die, the pack dissolves and a new one forms within a year. One pack will dissolve about once every thirty years.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{weapon of}} the KingCobra {{was to be}} the new wire-guided BGM-71 TOW {{anti-tank}} missile, which had proven highly effective in combat test firings in Vietnam from Huey gunships. This weapon could be carried <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> of four missiles, with one pack under each stub wing for a total of eight missiles. On launch, the TOW trailed out wires to communicate command guidance updates. The missile had two infrared flares on its tail to allow the SMS to track it. All the gunner had to do was keep the target in his sight, and the missile fire control system adjusted its flight appropriately. Both the gunner and the pilot had Sperry Univac helmet-mounted sights to allow them to acquire targets for the KingCobra's missiles and gun.|$|E
25|$|Some {{countries}} also impose {{legal requirements}} on the packaging of tobacco products. For example, {{in the countries}} of the European Union, Turkey, Australia and South Africa, cigarette packs must be prominently labeled with the health risks associated with smoking. Canada, Australia, Thailand, Iceland and Brazil have also imposed labels upon cigarette packs warning smokers of the effects, and they include graphic images of the potential health effects of smoking. Cards are also inserted into cigarette packs in Canada. There are sixteen of them, and only one comes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pack.</b> They explain different methods of quitting smoking. Also, in the United Kingdom, {{there have been a number}} of graphic NHS advertisements, one showing a cigarette filled with fatty deposits, as if the cigarette is symbolizing the artery of a smoker.|$|E

25|$|As in {{all other}} Trading Card Games, booster packs are the primary avenue of card {{distribution}}. In Konami's distribution areas, five or nine random cards are found in each booster pack depending on the set and each set contains around one hundred different cards. However, in Upper Deck's areas, early booster packs contained a random assortment of nine cards (rarity and value varies), with the whole set ranging around one hundred and thirty cards. To {{catch up with the}} Japanese meta game, two or more original sets were combined into one. Now, more recent Upper Deck sets have simply duplicated the original set. Some booster sets are reprinted/reissued (e.g. Dark Beginnings Volume 1 and 2). This type of set usually contains a larger number of cards (around 200 to 250), and they contain twelve cards along with one tip card rather than the normal five or nine. Since the release of Tactical Evolution, all booster packs that have a Holographic/Ghost Rare card, will also contain a rare, meaning if you receive a Holofoil card <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> you will still receive 1 Rare card and 7 Common cards. Current sets have 100 different cards per set. There are also special booster packs that are given to those who attend a tournament. These sets change each time there is a different tournament and have fewer cards than a typical booster pack. There are eight Tournament Packs, eight Champion Packs, and 10 Turbo Packs.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to licensed music, the game includes over 70 minutes of original score by Tim Schafer's long term collaborator Peter McConnell. McConnell composed pieces for orchestra and Metal band {{to tie in}} with the licensed music in the game. Also, the in-game soundtrack contains an instrumental drum track played by Slough Feg drummer Harry Cantwell, all other [...] "real" [...] drums (6 tracks) were played by Y drummer Mike Vanderhule and recorded by Jory Prum. The solos triggered by the player during the game were composed and recorded by Judas Priest guitarists Glenn Tipton (Eddie's solos) and K.K. Downing (Ophelia's and Doviculus' solos). While Schafer {{would like to have}} a soundtrack album for the game, he stated that there were already difficulties in securing the licenses for songs within the game and was not sure if it would be possible to extend them to a soundtrack. Schafer helped to select three songs—"We Are The Road Crew" [...] by Motörhead, [...] "The Metal" [...] by Tenacious D, and [...] "More Than Meets The Eye" [...] by Testament—to appear <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> of Rock Band downloadable songs that was made available the same day as Brütal Legends release.|$|E

Furthermore, 69 of the 85 tracks from Guitar Hero 5 will be importable into Band Hero. All transferred songs will also be playable in the Guitar Hero 5 and will be free if downloaded in either games.
