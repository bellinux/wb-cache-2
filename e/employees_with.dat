5|$|A unique form of {{circulating}} specie is {{the fuel}} ration coupon, {{which has been}} issued in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. Known denominations include 1, 5, 10, 20, 25, & 50 litres of petrol (gasoline), kerosene and/or diesel, and translate roughly into the local petrol price (about 1 UK pound sterling per litre or US$1.50 in late 2008). Businesses, including Western Union, have been reported paying <b>employees</b> <b>with</b> these coupons, and even auctions have been transacted in this currency. As with much Zimbabwe currency, printing standards are crude and counterfeiting is rampant; the RBZ has been dissuading this widespread use.|$|E

In 2007, when the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapsed, the wireless system helped coordinate rescuers and emergency services. The city and USI Wireless have won praise for the network, which has been singled out for being one of the few successful municipal wireless ventures nationwide among a number of stalled or failed projects.|$|E

5|$|Dayton Project {{employees}} {{were not allowed}} to eat or smoke in processing areas, and had to scrub their hands before leaving these areas. They also had to shower {{at the end of each}} day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. <b>Employees</b> <b>with</b> elevated levels of polonium were not allowed in the processing areas. Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making it easy to track. The employee at Unit IV with the highest levels of polonium in her urine had contaminated her hair, and often held bobby pins in her mouth.|$|E
5|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the navy, army, and local government devised a cleanup plan. Three hundred government <b>employees</b> (<b>with</b> guidance of the military) worked to clear debris. They quickly restored water and power service, and within a few days streets had been cleaned for most of the impacted area. Authorities in Manzanillo asked for medicine, clothing and food from nearby areas while the red cross treated the injured. Many of the displaced were evacuated to government offices. Within {{a few days after the}} storm, the ports of Manzanillo, Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Lazaro Cardenas were reopened. The remnants of the storm later brought rain to the Rockie Mountains and the Southwestern United States. Eugene is one of three known July Pacific hurricane strikes, where hurricane-force winds are estimated over land. The other two hurricanes were Hurricane Calvin in 1993 and a hurricane that struck Baja California Sur in 1954.|$|E

When the beta went public, more than a million played the first day, causing back-end servers to struggle to handle the traffic. While the engineering team had overestimated server load, bugs in server clusters caused game uploads to become backed up, slowing matchmaking until the underlying issues could be fixed. Jarrard noted that the 16million total hours of play time and large-scale rollout of the beta was vital to seeing how Reach would perform.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, Berry was {{mentioned}} as a possible nominee for U.S. Secretary of the Interior, a position obtained by Ken Salazar. President Barack Obama announced his intention to nominate Berry {{as director of the}} Office of Personnel Management on March 3, 2009, and did so on March 4. The nomination hearing before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on March 26, 2009, led to expectation of easy confirmation for Berry, despite opposition from conservative activists based on Berry's homosexuality. In the hearing Berry stated he supported any effective employee compensation system, but that the federal government had the obligation to give <b>employees</b> <b>with</b> comparable job performances similar pay and treatment. He pledged to preserve veterans preference and supplement it with training programs to prepare veterans for federal jobs, and promised reviews of proposals to improve the security clearance and hiring processes. Berry emphasized the importance for agencies to use all recruitment tools, citing relocation benefits that could keep agencies competitive with the private sector, and stated he would create a strategic plan and set performance goals for the Office of Personnel Management. Berry had stated support for benefits for same-sex partners of federal employees and a repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act.|$|E
5|$|In {{efficiency}} wage models, {{workers are}} paid at levels that maximize productivity instead of clearing the market. For example, in developing countries, firms might {{pay more than}} a market rate to ensure their workers can afford enough nutrition to be productive. Firms might also pay higher wages to increase loyalty and morale, possibly leading to better productivity. Firms can also pay higher than market wages to forestall shirking. Shirking models were particularly influential. Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz (1984) created a model where employees tend to avoid work unless firms can monitor worker effort and threaten slacking <b>employees</b> <b>with</b> unemployment. If the economy is at full employment, a fired shirker simply moves to a new job. Individual firms pay their workers a premium over the market rate to ensure their workers would rather work and keep their current job instead of shirking and risk having {{to move to a}} new job. Since each firm pays more than market clearing wages, the aggregated labor market fails to clear. This creates a pool of unemployed laborers and adds to the expense of getting fired. Workers not only risk a lower wage, they risk being stuck in the pool of unemployed. Keeping wages above market clearing levels creates a serious disincentive to shirk that makes workers more efficient even though it leaves some willing workers unemployed.|$|E
