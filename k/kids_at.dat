25|$|The scene late in {{the film}} where Grier, Lawrence, and Murphy hug {{in front of the}} Empire State Building was shot around one or two o'clock in the morning, when the lights are usually shut off. If the filmmakers had them shut off at their command, it would have cost them $40–$60,000, so instead Hudlin had the three hug, and the lights were {{eventually}} shut off as usual. When editing the film, they simply reversed the footage to make it appear as if the lights were being turned on. The filmmakers even thought about ending the movie at this point, deciding instead to go with Marcus attempting to win back Angela's affection. For this, an alternate ending was shot where Angela is teaching the <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> the school and Marcus comes, talks to her and eventually wins her back; the filmmakers thought it was slow and uninteresting, and eventually came up with the released version.|$|E

500|$|Radiohead did {{not support}} The King of Limbs with live {{performances}} until several months after its release, as Yorke wanted to continue studio work, and {{it took some time}} to arrange the album for live performance. They enlisted drummer Clive Deamer, best known for his work with Portishead and Get the Blessing, to help perform the complex rhythms. Selway said of the two-drummer setup: [...] "That was fascinating. One played in the traditional way, the other almost mimicked a drum machine. It was push-and-pull, like <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> play, really interesting." ...|$|E

He then went underground, never to be seen again, and did business only through underlings {{who did not know}} for whom they were working.

500|$|To {{perform the}} rhythmically complex King of Limbs {{material}} live, Radiohead enlisted a second drummer, Clive Deamer, {{who had worked}} with Portishead and Get the Blessing; Selway said of the collaboration: [...] "One played in the traditional way, the other almost mimicked a drum machine. It was push-and-pull, like <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> play, really interesting." [...] With Deamer, Radiohead recorded a second From the Basement session, released online as [...] in August 2011.

500|$|Although he {{had done}} {{research}} on pandemics six {{months prior to the}} 2009 flu pandemic, the outbreak was [...] "really helpful" [...] to his studies, because it provided a glimpse of the societal apparatus following the onset stages of a pandemic. To him, it was not solely the virus itself that one had to be concerned about, but how society handles the situation. [...] "I saw them come to life", Burns said, [...] "and I saw issues about, 'Well, do you close the schools and if you close the schools, then who stays home with the kids? And will everyone keep their <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> home?' Things happening online, which is where the Jude Law character came from, that there's going to be information that comes out online where people want to be ahead of the curve, so some people will write things about anti-virals or different treatment protocols, and so there's always going to be an information and that information also has sort of a viral pulse." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{keep the}} {{children}} complacent, Mr. Black informs the campers that Krusty has finally come, {{but it is}} actually Barney dressed as Krusty. Bart leads the campers in rebellion, driving out Mr. Black and the bullies, and changing the camp's name to Camp Bart. Kent Brockman reports on the revolt, where Bart explains the camp's deplorable conditions that caused him and the campers to rebel in the first place. The stress of seeing Bart {{as the leader of}} the rebellion during the report on TV causes Homer to immediately lose the hair he grew and regain the lost weight. Krusty is called away from his vacation, and arrives at the camp where the <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> first don't believe its him, until a rough search reveals his iconic pacemaker scar.

500|$|Connelly {{contributed to}} four tracks, {{including}} [...] "Blame", which also featured the horn section from the Oakland, California based group Tower of Power. [...] Nicole Blackman, KMFDM's publicist at the time, contributed spoken word vocals {{to the track}} [...] "Dogma", which was adapted from the ten-minute live performance she provided while touring with the band. [...] "Power", meanwhile, was made to fulfill a request by the band's label, Wax Trax!, for a radio promo song. [...] Konietzko said he'd heard [...] "radio didn't like big female choruses", so he got voiceover commercial singer Cheryl Wilson {{to help with the}} song, which he called [...] "dumb and catchy". [...] The hidden track of the album, [...] "Fairy", is a story narrated by Jr. Blackmail, who had worked with the band previously in the 1980s. [...] Konietzko said it was inspired by Blackmail's [...] "dirty fantasies". [...] He also said it was not a serious track: [...] "it was more like <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> play". [...] For the background sounds, the group did things like roll screws on the floor while Schulz played piano.|$|E
500|$|Extraterrestrials {{make their}} first {{appearance}} in this episode, as Carter {{thought it would be}} a good moment to reveal them. The image of the alien was stretched in post-production to make it look taller and skinnier. The writers for the episode researched various abductee reports and conspiracy theories in order to get the right feel for the episode and make the aliens appear realistic and not [...] "fanciful". The episode makes several mentions to the Voyager program and the Voyager Golden Record; Mulder and Senator Matheson listen to Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 in F. First Movement while in the latter's office. The concerto's first movement is the first piece of music on the Voyager record. In addition, the episode relies heavily on mentions of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program, the collective name for a number of activities people undertake to search for intelligent extraterrestrial life. Morgan later explained, “I always wanted to do something with the SETI background. Hope that <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> school check out SETI, because it was factual as to what exists.” ...|$|E
