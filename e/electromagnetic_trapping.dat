40|$|Near-field <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>trapping</b> of {{particles}} is generally obtained bymeans of gradient forces. In this paper, {{we discuss the}} attractive behavior of curl-spin forces, {{as well as their}} potential for near-field <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>trapping</b> and manipulation. It is demonstrated that curl-spin forces enable the trapping {{of particles}} operating at their resonant frequency. Such phenomena can be exploited to design more efficient and selective electromagnetic traps, to boost near-field energy exchange systems, and to bring stability to coupled resonant radiators. It also is illustrated how the balance between the gradient, radiation pressure, and curl-spin force components leads to the formation of zero-force rings around their sources, which explicitly demarcate the trapping regions. Analytical and numerical analyses are presented to assess the stability of the trapping mechanism.

40|$|The {{photonic}} interaction generally {{responsible for}} the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>trapping</b> of molecules is forward-Rayleigh scattering, {{a process that is}} mediated by transition electric dipoles connecting the ground electronic state and virtual excited states. Higher order electric and magnetic multipole contributions to the scattering amplitude are usually negligible. However, on consideration of chiral discrimination effects (in which an input light of left-handed circular polarization can present different observables compared to right-handed polarization, or molecules of opposite enantiomeric form respond differently to a set circular polarization), the mechanism must be extended to specifically accommodate transition magnetic dipoles. Moreover, it is important to account for the fact that chiral molecules are necessarily non-spherical, so that their interactions with a laser beam will have an orientational dependence. Using quantum electrodynamics, this article quantifies the extent of the energetic discrimination that arises when chiral molecules are optically trapped, placing particular emphasis on the orientational effects of the trapping beam. An in-depth description of the intricate ensemble-weighted method used to incorporate the latter is presented. It is thus shown that, when a mixture of molecular enantiomers is irradiated by a continuous beam of circularly polarized light, a difference arises in the relative rates of migration of each enantiomer {{in and out of the}} most intense regions of the beam. In consequence, optical trapping can be used as a means of achieving enantiomer separation...|$|E

40|$|Four {{cases of}} {{nonlinear}} obliquely propagating MS waves are considered using a test particle approach: i) monochromatic waves propagating both sunward and anti-sunward, ii) monochromatic waves propagating unidirectionally towards the Sun, ii) a broad band spectrum, propagating both sunward and anti-sunward, iv) a broad band spectrum, propagating sunward only. As {{the solar wind}} decelerates rapidly inside the bow shock due to mass loading, the interplanetary magnetic field increases. Calculations have been performed taking into account of a spatially dependent IMF based on observations. We find significant particle trapping and acceleration for the monochromatic oblique waves. For the “turbulent ” case, {{it is found that}} for oblique propagation (angle between the interplanetary magnetic field and the propagation vector is larger than 30 degrees), the particles are again highly accelerated but the trapping is very much suppressed due to stochasticity. We compare the relative heating and acceleration for the four cases and discuss the physical mechanisms of trapping and acceleration, Pitch angle scattering and acceleration of particles are found to be much larger in the case of sunward and anti-sunward propagating waves than those for the sunward waves only. This is because of the different stochastic effects associated with the two cases resulting in larger power for sunward and anti-sunward propagating waves than that for the sunward propagating waves only. The <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>trapping</b> of particles in the case of sunward and anti-sunward propagating waves is less than {{that in the case of}} sunward propagating waves only.

40|$|Magneto-resistive biosensors {{have been}} found to be useful because of their high sensitivity, low cost, small size, and direct {{electrical}} output. They use super-paramagnetic beads to label a biological target and detect it via sensing the stray field. In this paper, we report a new setup for magnetic biosensors, replacing the conventional "sandwich" concept with an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>trap.</b> We demonstrate the capability of the biosensor in the detection of E. coli. The trap is formed by a current-carrying microwire that attracts the magnetic beads into a sensing space on top of a tunnel magneto-resistive sensor. The sensor signal depends on the number of beads in the sensing space, which depends on the size of the beads. This enables the detection of biological targets, because such targets increase the volume of the beads. Experiments were carried out with a 6. μm wide microwire, which attracted the magnetic beads from a distance of 60. μm, when a current of 30. mA was applied. A sensing space of 30. μm in length and 6. μm in width was defined by the magnetic sensor. The results showed that individual E. coli bacterium inside the sensing space could be detected using super-paramagnetic beads that are 2. 8. μm in diameter. The <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>trap</b> setup greatly simplifies the device and reduces the detection process to two steps: (i) mixing the bacteria with magnetic beads and (ii) applying the sample solution to the sensor for measurement, which can be accomplished within about 30. min with a sample volume in the μl range. This setup also ensures that the biosensor can be cleaned easily and re-used immediately. The presented setup is readily integrated on chips via standard microfabrication techniques. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
