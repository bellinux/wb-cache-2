50|$|Underlying all of Jupitter-Larsen's work's a {{peculiar}} mix of aesthetic and conceptual obsessions, particularly entropy and decay, professional wrestling, and a self-created lexicon consisting mainly of personalized {{units of measurement}} such as polywave, the totimorphous, and the xylowave. In 1985, Jupitter-Larsen invented his own number system. Jupitter-Larsen says his transexpansion numeral unit (TNU) explore the distance & separateness in between linear counting locations that do not neighbor each other. When arranged in order, the TNUs form a spiral around the standard linear numbers. If one assumes that each individual linear number is a particular location along a counting order, then each individual TNU would be the distance between two selected linear number locations. Where the TNUs have been placed is unimportant. What is important is that anyone can {{make up their own}} personal numbers to symbolize any numeral interrelationship that Jupitter-Larsen's do not. Instead of a way of <b>doing</b> arithmetic, what <b>you</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> with here is an emotional & philosophical barometer. The base TNU is I (pronounced a) which is located in between 1&4 but not 2&3.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{processors}} {{include a}} number of separate [...] "subprocessors" [...] known as functional units that are tuned to operating on {{a particular type of}} data. For instance, a modern CPU typically has two or three functional units dedicated to processing integer data and logic instructions, known as ALUs, while other units handle floating-point numbers, the FPUs, or multimedia data, SIMD. MAJC instead used a single multi-purpose functional unit which could process any sort of data. In theory this approach meant that processing any one type of data would take longer, perhaps much longer, than processing the same data in a unit dedicated to that type of data. But on the other hand, these general-purpose units also meant that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not <b>end</b> <b>up</b> with large portions of the CPU being unused because the program just happened to be doing lots of (for example) floating point calculations at that particular point in time.|$|R

40|$|The {{pursuit of}} {{sustainable}} development, a {{more and more}} current goal in the global society, affects entirely the responsibility of each territorial system. An integrated approach to sustainable well-being of each territorial system, besides, rests on the commitment of all its stakeholders to contribute to building a Green Society. This means, for each of them, a no-environmental dumping pathway. But the market globalization forces all territorial systems to {{compete with each other}} with respect to: provision of goods and services; ability to attract financial capital, foreign direct investment, human capital and residential settlements. If territories aim for a homogenisation process, to compete with each other, this strategy, especially without strong public and private investments in innovation and labor productivity growth, it will trigger, as a very likely result, a race to the bottom, through the most different ways of dumping. The natural result will be to put at risk the possibility within them, to aim for an integrated approach to sustainable well-being. Lacking, then, the goal of a Green Society.

5000|$|Regarding [...] "East Side Story", {{the opening}} track, {{when asked why}} he picked New York for the song, Adams replied, [...] "Probably {{because there is so}} much street {{activity}} there, even though there is an east side to every city, the NY east side, or lower east side, is particularly full of character. It just seemed to paint the picture." [...] The second track, [...] "This Side of Paradise", is about finding the truth; ironically, there were many American radio stations who refused to play the song because of the line [...] "There ain't no Santa Claus". The first single, [...] "Open Road", was completed over two continents while Adams was touring. [...] "The basic track was recorded in Vancouver, at the Warehouse studio," [...] Adams notes, but the vocals were done in Paris, France and guitarist Keith Scott started working on the song backstage in Lethbridge, Alberta. The music video for the song is not so much about traffic as it is about [...] "power, authority ... and anti-establishment" [...] statements. The album's title track deals [...] "with the idea that touring can be very lonely".

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a summary of}} some of the {{considerations}} involved in applying an existing model to a new problem, in particular in deciding whether to update or not, and some of the issues involved in interpreting the output from the new application. Thus where <b>you</b> start from <b>does</b> influence where <b>you</b> <b>end</b> <b>up.</b> Both change in total surplus {{and to a lesser extent}} the distribution of this change in total surplus across sectors, depends on the price and quantity data which is used to define the initial equilibrium, even if elasticity values are the same. So careful consideration should be given to whether an existing model should be updated because updating a model does matter. The final point to restate is that consumers of pig meat <b>end</b> <b>up</b> being the winners from either cost saving technology at the farm level or new product development or advertising campaigns at the retail level. Even for new technology implemented at the farm level, producers only receive about 20 per cent of the total benefits. These issues are discussed in detail in Mounter et al. (2005 a, 2005 b). Therefore in relation to the new problem outlined above, we now have a modelling framework available for the task that has been tested in a number of different ways and that now reflects current industry structure and size.

40|$|Few {{would argue}} that {{maintenance}} is not a problem. Practices do not eliminate problems, but only proper practice makes perfect maintenance. To master management of building services maintenance, {{there is no better}} teacher than experience. You must plan your maintenance system thoughtfully and try it out together with your professional knowledge. The system outlined in this article gives a systematic procedure in setting up a workable maintenance plan. The tedious management work and the inconvenience caused to a busy or new maintenance department will probably mean greater pressure of work for the maintenance engineer in the first year, but thereafter the pressure will be less than before and benefits of an organised system of maintenance will repay the effort of introducing it. It is essential that the paperwork be as simple as possible and very flexible in operation so that amendments can be made easily. Preparation of paperwork is by no means easy. It is highly likely that your schedules and programmes will have to be rewritten two or three times before arriving at the optimum plan. My management lecturer once told me: "Without a plan and a programme, you don't know whether <b>you</b> have <b>done</b> all the things that <b>you</b> need to <b>do,</b> and <b>you</b> will <b>end</b> <b>up</b> with many problems.
