In early 1091, William Rufus invaded Normandy with a sufficiently large army to bring Robert to the negotiating table. The two brothers signed a treaty at Rouen, granting William Rufus a range of lands and castles in Normandy. In return, William Rufus promised to support Robert's attempts {{to regain control of}} the neighbouring county of Maine, once under Norman control, and help in regaining control over the Duchy, including Henry's lands.

At that last date, the Domesday Book records thirty-three landholding housecarls in the kingdom, a limited number; and furthermore, these estates were small. Thus, it does not seem that the English landholders were deprived of their properties to provide for land grants to the king's housecarls.

500|$|In 608, the Exarchate of Africa under Heraclius the Elder revolted against Emperor Phocas. The {{subsequent}} {{campaign against}} Phocas was portrayed by Byzantine historians as avenging {{the death of}} Maurice, {{which might have been}} part of the motivation of this revolt. The other part, however, would be what Walter Emil Kaegi termed [...] "cold political calculations": Carthage was at a safe distance from Constantinople and Phocas could not easily launch an attack against it. The relative wealth of the Exarchate of Africa could well enough finance a revolt. Phocas's regime arguably needed the grain and revenues from Africa, while the Exarchate sustained itself with relative ease. Meanwhile, the Persian shah Khosrau II had secured control of Dara and was mobilizing his troops for a large-scale invasion into Byzantine territories. News of this campaign could have well reached Heraclius the Elder. With Phocas facing two separate military fronts, the emperor would be unable to concentrate the majority of his troops on <b>either</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> encouraging Heraclius the Elder of his chances to succeed in this confrontation.|$|E

40|$|Prior {{studies on}} real options usually pay little {{attention}} to the differentiated effects of various unexpected events on making investment decisions. To fix this limit, this paper proposes a new computing method independent on definite distribution functions for the real option model with jump processes of randomly distributed frequency and amplitude. Based on this method, this paper also discusses the impacts of unexpected events on project investments. The results show that: 1) Ignoring the difference among various unexpected events by averaging their effects would lead to systematic mistakes in making investment decisions. 2) The moving direction of unexpected events is the key factor in decision making. In general, the more advantageous unexpected events look like, the higher value the real option has and the longer the firm should hold its project investment. 3) With the existence of various unexpected events, <b>either</b> missing <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> or assuming them to be homogeneous would cause significant errors in calculating the value of the real option, especially in the case that the project itself fluctuates greatly.
