40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} writing this thesis was to improve methods during {{requirements}} engineering phase. Usercentred system engineering has some problem areas, which are examined and verified {{to create a}} new guideline for developers. This guideline tends to make requirements engineering more effective and help developers create more concrete requirements. It is not uncommon that system development projects ends up with unsatisfied users or delay in deliveries. The reasons are different kinds of communication problems between users and developers during verification of requirements. There is a therapy model, called solution-focused therapy, used in family and individual therapy. The model focuses on solutions for the future instead of problems in the past. This method has never been used in system developing until today. Based on literature studies and scenarios we have shown {{that it is possible to}} transfer this pedagogy into the system developing branch especially in requirements engineering. During our investigation we have shown that the pedagogy refute the difficulties within usercentred design. The pedagogy model can be used in four kinds of methods for capturing requirements; questionnaires, interviews, workshops and observations. The model activates and makes the user more implicated. To show this, we have applied the pedagogy model on scenarios taken from earlier experiences of requirements engineering. The outcome of this investigation is that developers can create a more pleasant communication atmosphere with this pedagogy. A result of this is that users becomes more willing and helpful {{to create a new}} system and therefore makes it easier for developers and users to <b>cooperate.</b> <b>You</b> can avoid many communication problems if you know how to go around them...|$|R

In 1968 a Catholic monk, Padre Marian, mentioned the religion on his television program and read the prayer by 'Abdu'l-Bahá. Also Maud Basio who aside from all her services (see below) was also mother of Mrs. Firuz Kazemzadeh, died. In 1969 the Italian Bahá'í Publishing Trust was established and the national assembly established cooperative relations with the Italian Esperanto Federation. By September 1970 Alfredo Speranza, a noted pianist who moved to Italy, joined the religion {{as well as the}} first citizen of San Marino. In May 1976 a 1,000-word article reviewing the religion was printed in La Stampa in Turin after interviewing the secretary of the national assembly A. Parsa, {{a member of the national}} assembly, was invited to start a weekly one-hour broadcast called [...] "Programme Baha'i" [...] on a station in Pisa. Other regular radio broadcasts began inBologna, Bolzano and Trofarello. Along with informational talks from Bahá'í teachings music was interspersed from various Baha'i musicians like Seals and Crofts, Dizzy Gillespie, England Dan and John Ford Coley as well as Italian artists. In February 1977 coordinated efforts focused the national community on Brescia, Cosenza and Salerno for one week and in Lipari, Messina and Trofarello the second week. At the end of the effort Salerno elected an assembly. The assembly of Trieste rented display case for Bahá'í literature at a bus terminal in Muggia and also awarded trophies for service to humanity. Cosenza was the focus of some effort in August 1977 when traveling teachers visiting the pioneer there.

40|$|Theory of Mind (ToM) is {{the ability}} to {{attribute}} mental states (e. g., beliefs and desires) to other people in order to understand and predict their behaviour. If others are rewarded to compete or <b>cooperate</b> with <b>you,</b> then what they will do depends upon what they believe about you. This is the reason why social interaction induces recursive ToM, of the sort "I think that you think that I think, etc. ". Critically, recursion is the common notion behind the definition of sophistication of human language, strategic thinking in games, and, arguably, ToM. Although sophisticated ToM is believed to have high adaptive fitness, broad experimental evidence from behavioural economics, experimental psychology and linguistics point towards limited recursivity in representing other's beliefs. In this work, we test whether such apparent limitation may not in fact be proven to be adaptive, i. e. optimal in an evolutionary sense. First, we propose a meta-Bayesian approach that can predict the behaviour of ToM sophistication phenotypes who engage in social interactions. Second, we measure their adaptive fitness using evolutionary game theory. Our main contribution is to show that one does not have to appeal to biological costs to explain our limited ToM sophistication. In fact, the evolutionary cost/benefit ratio of ToM sophistication is non trivial. This is partly because an informational cost prevents highly sophisticated ToM phenotypes to fully exploit less sophisticated ones (in a competitive context). In addition, cooperation surprisingly favours lower levels of ToM sophistication. Taken together, these quantitative corollaries of the "social Bayesian brain" hypothesis provide an evolutionary account for both the limitation of ToM sophistication in humans as well as the persistence of low ToM sophistication levels...|$|R
