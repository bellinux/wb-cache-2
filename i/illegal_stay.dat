40|$|Based on {{qualitative}} {{research into the}} Chinese catering industry in the Netherlands, this article describes labour relations between Chinese employers and their (undocumented) employees {{against the background of}} a society in which criminal, administrative, and immigration law increasingly converge. The authors argue that the intertwining of these three fields of law asks for an adaptation of the concept of crimmigration. Furthermore the authors claim that an overemphasis on the legal definition of ‘labour exploitation’ distances law from the people it addresses as it reduces employers to offenders and employees to victims. Such a normative perspective prevents us from gaining further insights into underlying issues such as <b>illegal</b> <b>stay,</b> informal labour practices and labour relations within migrant niches. The authors argue on the contrary that Chinese restaurant owners and their employees operate in a ‘moral economy’ where labour relations are influenced not only by formal rules and a demand for reasonably priced food and flexible, motivated, inexpensive and skilled employees, but also by informal rules and culturally shared expectations about justice and reciprocity...|$|E

40|$|The paper I {{put forward}} is {{supposed}} to inform reader with problems of legal and <b>illegal</b> <b>stay</b> of foreigners in Czech Republic with regard to European union. First we will deal with a law about stay of foreigners on the land of Czech Republic and a law about asylum. This norms are thanks to our subject {{one of the most}} important and its necessary to have a good orientation in it. All stays of foreigners in our country is being governed by these laws. Fundamental part of this paper will deal with secondary analysis of data of legal and illegal migration on soil of Czech Republic with regard to EU. A part of this paper dealing with the law about stay of foreigners on the land of Czech Republic will structure for us a different kinds of stays of foreigners in Czech, that will be later splitted up and individually described. In that description we will find information who and under what conditions and from whom one can obtain the permit, what is its purpose, on the other hand also when, why and who can the permit cancel. In this part you can also find repressive steps in case of breaking this law. Also we mention asylum which is often being used to legalize" the stay. With regard to the title of this paper you can also find here a part about European Union that describes and explains some of the basic, historical, functional and other information about EU. Basic information disclose for example the size, number of inhabitants, national anthem and other. Historical information describe the origin and development of EU. Functional information describe basic principles of functionality of different departments of EU. Secondary data analysis of legal and illegal migration of foreigners in Czech with regard to EU is the core of this paper. This part intends to inform the reader in whole about numbers, nationalities and other data about legal and <b>illegal</b> <b>stay</b> of foreigners in Czech Republic with regard to EU. Also here you can find all the data of all categories of foreigners in Czech in the year of entry to EU compared to the numbers of foreigners in Czech in the previous year.

This means that Chinese {{students}} have a stronger tendency than those from the other countries to choose <b>illegal</b> <b>stay</b> in Japan after their student visas have expired. In the present study, we would like to clarify the features of Chinese over-stayers who were once students in Japan by making comparisons with the sentiments toward Japan of Chinese ex-students working in Japan, of college students, of vocational school students and of Japanese language school students. This paper reveals the following interesting facts. They have less satisfaction with their life in Japan and have less friendly feelings toward the Japanese society than Chinese workers and college students have. As a result, only 17. 4 % of them want to stay longer in Japan, while 65. 2 % wish to live in the U. S. A or other free countries and districts. Their financial conditions can also explain the above result. Their conditions are better than those oflanguage school students, but are worse than those of workers. Smaller income than their expectation might induce them to give up their illegal over-stay in Japan...|$|E

40|$|Reflecting recent {{enforcement}} policy activism of US states, {{this paper}} examines federal-state overlap {{of illegal immigration}} policy in a spatial context. Keeping the US-Mexico context in mind, we assume that labor from a source nation enters a host nation through bordering states. Once in the host, <b>illegal</b> immigrants may <b>stay</b> {{in the state of}} entry or move to another state. The host nation's federal government and/or the state governments choose border and internal enforcement policies, and also provide local goods. As a benchmark, we define the completely centralized solution as the case where the federal government chooses all the policies, while the state governments are passive. At higher levels of decentralization (i. e., as states take more responsibility in deciding some of the policies), the overlap of federal and state policies is associated with both vertical and horizontal externalities. Among other results, we find that if inter-state mobility is costless, internal enforcement is overprovided, and border enforcement and local goods are under-provided under decentralization, leading to relatively high levels of illegal immigration. While inter-state migration costs moderate such overprovision/under-provision, extreme levels of inter-state immobility may lead to too little illegal immigration, and an overprovision of local goods...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of former unaccompanied minors in the Netherlands leave for unknown {{destinations}} during the asylum procedure or after being rejected. In this contribution the authors provide answers to the question how undocumented (former) unaccompanied minors provide for their iving and housing. The study is {{based on interviews with}} 118 former undocumented unaccompanied minors who were recruited through the personal networks of the researchers and through contacts with representatives of (private) organizations who support the youngsters. The undocumented minors are excluded from formal employment as well as provisions of the welfare state. By far the largest group of the undocumented (former) unaccompanied minors has never been involved in criminal activities and only one third of them work in the informal economy. The sectors in which these youngsters perform informal work vary from cleaning and construction to catering and personal services. The work is characterized by uncertain working hours. There are often few hours available and the work often takes place on call. The pay is meagre and few respondents can survive exclusively on their earnings. The undocumented (former) unaccompanied minors are mainly supported by friends and private organizations for their living and housing. It is because of this support that the youngsters do not roam the streets and can continue their <b>illegal</b> <b>stay</b> in the Netherlands. The strong orientation of the youngsters towards a lawful residence in the Netherlands causes them to fear the risks of arrest while working, so they rather settle for the limited support of private organizations and friends. The support of private organizations and the focus of the youngsters towards a lawful stay thus constitute a buffer against exploitation...|$|E

While there is a sizable discussion of the actual repercussions that legal marijuana would entail, no one knows what will happen.

Furthermore, the lack of specific information of existing black market trade makes pure economically driven policies highly speculative.
