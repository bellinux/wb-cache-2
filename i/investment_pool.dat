25|$|University of Dayton (Dayton, Ohio, USA)– In May 2014, the University of Dayton's {{board of}} {{trustees}} unanimously approved a plan to begin to divest the university's holdings from the top 200 fossil-fuel companies.

40|$|SUMMARY: The Commission {{is today}} proposing new rules {{designed}} to provide additional investor protections that would affect <b>pooled</b> <b>investment</b> vehicles, including hedge funds. First, the Commission is proposing a rule that would prohibit advisers to <b>pooled</b> <b>investment</b> vehicles from making false or misleading statements or otherwise defrauding investors or prospective investors in those <b>pooled</b> <b>investment</b> vehicles. Second, the Commission is proposing two rules that would revise the definition of accredited investor {{as it relates to}} natural persons. The latter rules would apply solely to the offer and sale of interests in certain privately offered <b>investment</b> <b>pools</b> specified in the rules. DATES: Comments should be received on or before March 9, 2007. ADDRESSES: Comments may be submitted by any of the following methods: Electronic comments...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, central bankers and {{financial}} institution supervisors have sharpened {{their focus on}} the increasingly important role that private <b>pools</b> of <b>investment</b> funds play in global financial markets. The growth in these pools has contributed significantly to market efficiency and financial stability by expanding liquidity in many financial markets, improving price discovery, and, ultimately, lowering the costs of capital. Private <b>investment</b> <b>pools</b> and the alternative investment strategies they pursue have contributed to a signifi cant expansion of the global markets and have helped accelerate the evolution in traded credit products such as credit derivatives, collateralized debt obligations, and the securitization of an increasing array of traditionally illiquid assets. However, {{because of the lack}} of transparency and an established regime of supervision of these investment vehicles, policymakers and supervisors have become concerned about customer protection and the potential for systemic risk. This paper discusses some of the key issues confronting supervisors in light of the recent growth of private <b>investment</b> <b>pools</b> and the rapid developments in the area of credit risk transfer, with a particular focus on the implications of these trends regarding systemic risk and financial stability. ...|$|R

As with credit funds, these pools are not subject to ratings oversight or diversification requirements, and allow managers significant freedom in picking and choosing investments. Mezzanine funds are, however, riskier than credit funds in that they carry both debt and equity characteristics.|$|R

50|$|Another form of {{insurance}} that was popular {{from time to}} time was life insurance. However, private insurance companies could usually not compete with government life annuities when the government was active in this market.

After 1780 the French government started to dominate this market with its life annuities. The private life-insurance contracts often took the form of group <b>investment</b> <b>pools</b> that paid pensions to nominees. A peculiar feature was often a tontine format that offered windfall profits to surviving nominees.
