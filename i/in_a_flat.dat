5|$|The murder inquiry, codenamed Operation Braid, {{was one of}} {{the largest}} police {{investigations}} ever undertaken in the Bristol area. The case dominated news coverage in the United Kingdom around the Christmas period as Yeates' family sought assistance from the public through social networking services and press conferences. Rewards amounting to £60,000 were offered for information leading to those responsible for Yeates' death. The police initially suspected and arrested Christopher Jefferies, Yeates' landlord, who lived <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> in the same building. He was subsequently released without charge.|$|E

5|$|Allen {{was born}} on 31 July 1902 in Bellevue Hill, Sydney, Australia, the second of three {{children}} to Walter Allen, a lawyer, and his wife Marguerite (Pearl), née Lamb, {{the daughter of a}} Queensland Minister of Lands. Later rumours suggested that Allen's real father may have been the Middlesex cricketer Pelham Warner, who supported Allen in his cricket career. Both of Allen's parents had roots in England as well as Australia. In 1909, when Allen was six years old, his family moved to London—hoping that the children would benefit from an English education—where they initially lived <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> before moving to various country villages. Finding that they enjoyed England, the family abandoned plans to return to Australia.|$|E
5|$|As Allen's {{first-class}} career {{came to a}} close, {{he moved}} into administration and held considerable influence in English and world cricket. He {{was instrumental in the}} creation of a MCC coaching manual, and worked hard to eliminate illegal bowling actions. As chairman of selectors from 1955 to 1961, he presided over a period of great success for English cricket, during which he worked closely with the Test captain Peter May. In 1963, he became MCC president, and was made the club's treasurer the following year. In this role, he was deeply involved in the D'Oliveira affair, a controversy over the potential selection of Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa. After Allen's gradual retirement from his administrative roles, he was knighted in 1986 and spent his later years <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> close to Lord's Cricket Ground, where he died, aged 87, in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Before joining Bernard in Paris, Rosa stays <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> in London {{for several}} weeks. Now {{that she has}} no {{intention}} of honouring the agreement of her passport, which was to return to South Africa within a year, she openly introduces herself as Burger's daughter. This attracts the attention of the media and she attends several political events. At one such event, Rosa sees Baasie, but when she tries to talk to him, he starts criticising her for not knowing his real name (Zwelinzima Vulindlela). He says that there is nothing special about her father having died in prison as many black fathers have also died there, and adds that he does not need her help. Rosa is devastated by her childhood friend's hurtful remarks, and overcome with guilt, she abandons her plans of going into exile in France and returns to South Africa.|$|E

After leaving Holly Hill, Montalban moved to a flat in the Queen Alexandra Mansions at 3 Grape Street in the St. Giles {{district}} of Holborn. Here, she was in close proximity to the two primary bookstores then catering to occult interests, Atlantis Bookshop and Watkins Bookshop, {{as well as to the}} British Museum. She offered one of the rooms in her flat to a young astrologer and musician, Rick Hayward, whom she had met in the summer of 1967; he joined the OMS, and in the last few months of Montalban's life authored her astrological forecasts for Prediction. After her death, he continued publishing astrological prophecies in Prediction and Prediction Annual until summer 2012.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Hastings {{published}} his autobiography, simply titled The Autobiography of Sir Patrick Hastings, {{and the following}} year published Cases in Court, a book giving his views on 21 of his most noted cases. The same year he published Famous and Infamous Cases, a book on noted trials through history, such as those at Nuremberg. In early 1948, he suffered a small stroke which forced him to retire permanently from work as a barrister. On 11 November 1949, {{he and his wife}} travelled to Kenya, where their son Nicky had moved {{to start a new life}} after the end of the Second World War. While there, he suffered a second stroke due to the air pressure, and he never fully recovered. Hastings spent the next two years of his life living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> in London, before dying on 26 February 1952 of cerebral thrombosis.|$|E

They initially lived <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> in Chelsea before moving to Elfin Cottage in Beckenham in 1926, and then to Old Thatch in Bourne End (called Peterswood in her books) in 1929.

5|$|Scientific {{investigation}} {{has resulted in}} several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. In the West, belief <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> Earth was displaced {{by the idea of}} spherical Earth, credited to Pythagoras in the 6th century BC. Earth was further believed {{to be the center of}} the universe until the 16th century when scientists first theorized that it was a moving object, comparable to the other planets in the Solar System. Due to the efforts of influential Christian scholars and clerics such as James Ussher, who sought to determine the age of Earth through analysis of genealogies in Scripture, Westerners before the 19th century generally believed Earth to be a few thousand years old at most. It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least many millions of years.|$|E
5|$|Shaw wrote Take a Life, {{his first}} play, in 1961. He {{directed}} {{a production of}} the show at London's Mermaid Theatre, where he also played the lead role of the Detective. That same year he played two lead roles in George Bernard Shaw plays at the Dublin Theatre Festival: Mrs. Warren's Profession and Candida. Around this time, he also wrote an outline for a television comedy series about four girls sharing a flat, inspired by his real-life daughter, who was in her early twenties and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> with other girls her age. The series was submitted to the Granada Television company, which expressed interest in the show {{and said it was}} one of two under consideration for television.
