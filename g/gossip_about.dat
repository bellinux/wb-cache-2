5|$|In fact, {{during the}} 1950s, many {{families}} would intentionally hang gandingans outside their houses so other neighbors could easily hear them play. Young men would gather around the gandingan and <b>gossip</b> <b>about</b> people they dislike, usually “chatting” with other gandingan players further away. Locals says {{much of this}} jovial talk even contained sexual innuendoes, where all kinds of dirty words could be heard penetrating the night air.|$|E
5|$|The {{audiences that}} we built for those campaigns {{are having a}} {{different}} experience. They’re having a collective experience in which they literally bring different pieces, one to the next, swap them back and forth, <b>gossip</b> <b>about</b> them. They have an element of cocreation and a collaborative nature that doesn’t really have an analog that I’ve been able to think of in the arts.|$|E

Butler became the first general officer to be placed under arrest since the Civil War. He apologized to Secretary Adams and the court-martial was canceled with only a reprimand.|$|E
5|$|In {{the face}} of {{neighbourhood}} <b>gossip</b> <b>about</b> the death rate in the home, Catherine, Margaret, and Thomas moved their household to 105 Latimer Street and then again to 27 Ascot street. In September 1883, Thomas Higgins, then 45, became yet {{another member of the}} household to fall mysteriously ill. His stomach pains were severe enough that Doctor Whitford was called; the doctor attributed Higgins's illness to dysentery related to drinking cheap whiskey and prescribed opium and castor oil. Higgins died after two days of illness. Days later, the same doctor was contacted and asked to provide a death certificate. He did so, attributing the death to dysentery.|$|E

The latter took Smederevo on 29 June, completing the conquest of Serbia.|$|E

5|$|The {{check on}} Forbes' {{authority}} at Perryville was Dr. Sawyer, Harding's physician {{and chairman of}} the Federal Hospitalization Board. Sawyer told Harding that Forbes was selling valuable hospital supplies to an insider contractor. At first Harding did not believe it, but Sawyer secured proof in January 1923. A shocked Harding, who alternated between rage and despondency over the corruption in his administration, summoned Forbes to the White House and demanded his resignation. Harding did not want an open scandal and allowed Forbes to flee to Europe, from where he resigned on February 15, 1923.

5|$|Cape {{sold the}} US {{rights to the}} {{recently}} formed publishing house of Pascal Covici and Donald Friede. Friede had heard <b>gossip</b> <b>about</b> The Well at a party at Theodore Dreiser's house and immediately decided to acquire it. He had previously sold a copy of Dreiser's An American Tragedy to a Boston police officer to create a censorship test case, which he had lost; he was awaiting an appeal, which he would also lose. He took out a $10,000 bank loan to outbid another publisher which had offered a $7,500 advance, and enlisted Morris Ernst, co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, to defend the book against legal challenges. Friede invited John Saxton Sumner of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice to buy a copy directly from him, to ensure that he, not a bookseller, {{would be the one}} prosecuted. He also travelled to Boston to give a copy to the Watch and Ward Society, hoping both to further challenge censorship of literature and to generate more publicity; he was disappointed when they told him they saw nothing wrong with the book.|$|E
5|$|Further, {{the work}} shows {{evidence}} of its having been {{put together in}} a very haphazard and hasty fashion, with little to no subsequent editing of the material to form a cohesive narrative. Birley sees {{an example of the}} carelessness with which the author approached the work in the construction of Marcus Aurelius' biography, where midway through the Life of Marcus Aurelius the author found himself in a muddle, probably because he had historical material in excess of what he required, and also because he had already used up much of his source to write separate biographies of Lucius Verus and Avidius Cassius, whose lives intersected with Marcus'. The answer he came up with was to use Eutropius as his source for a brief overview of Marcus' principate following the death of Lucius Verus. However, he found that in doing so, the narrative's ending was too abrupt and so, after including some <b>gossip</b> <b>about</b> Commodus not being his son, he once again began an account of Marcus' reign after the death of Verus.|$|E

60|$|It did live. The little life, so frail, so {{unprofitable}} {{in every}} mere material view, so precious {{in the eyes}} of love, expanded and flowered at last into fair childhood.
