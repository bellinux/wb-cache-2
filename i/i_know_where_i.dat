500|$|In 1916, Coach Yost {{shared his}} {{recollections}} of the Buffalo game with Big Bill Edwards: [...] "Buffalo University came to Michigan with a much-heralded team. They were coached by a Dartmouth man {{and had not}} been scored upon. Buffalo papers referred to Michigan as the Woolly Westerners, and the Buffalo enthusiasts placed bets that Michigan would not score." [...] The score {{at the end of}} the first half was 65 to 0. About fifteen minutes after the second half had started, Yost discovered a Buffalo player, Simpson, [...] "on Michigan's side of the field, covered up in a blanket." [...] Yost was curious and asked, [...] "Simpson, what are you doing over here? You are on the wrong side." [...] To which, Simpson replied, [...] "Don't say anything. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am at. The coach has put me in three times already and I'm not going in there again. Enough is enough for any one. I've had mine." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{fragrance}} {{is described}} by Steal Their Style as a [...] "feminine and flowery fragrance". Along with Glow by JLo, the perfume achieved success in the fragrance market {{and became one of}} America's highest-selling bottles. Collectively with Glow by JLo, it brought in over $USD300 million within a year, making Lopez the nineteenth richest person under forty, according to business magazine Forbes. The Fragrance Foundation's FiFi Awards named it the [...] "Celebrity Fragrance of the Year" [...] in June 2003. Several writers compared the theme of Still Jennifer Lopez's promotional campaign to her hit-song [...] "Jenny from the Block" [...] (2002), in which she declared [...] "I'm Still, I'm Still Jenny from the Block / Used to have a little now I have a lot / No matter where I go, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> came from." [...] Speaking about the fragrance's slogan, The New York Times wrote that it is [...] "a line that refers partly to her composure under the media glare but also serves as a pitch to potential consumers [...] It also evokes a song from her latest album, Jenny from the Block, in which she declares that despite fame, she is essentially her old self from South Bronx." ...|$|E

60|$|I was snap-shotted {{twice before}} <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was. Then Mr. Magg drew {{a sheet of}} paper towards him, and began to make notes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was thoughtful. To {{some extent}} you're accountable. When one {{is forced to}} loaf one has time to ponder, and when you inquired if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> went--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I'm mighty glad we met those men," [...] {{declared}} Gif. [...] "Now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am. Thank goodness! {{we are not}} so {{very far}} {{out of the way}} after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah if {{we could}} only get there {{it would be a}} relief. I should draw a long breath. There at least <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am and what people are. But here one lives on hollow ground!" ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> {{they are}}, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> they are, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> they are ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why did I {{find her}} {{standing}} {{there like a}} goddess who had just stepped out of her cloud? Why did I look at her? Before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was, the harm was done." ...|$|R
5000|$|Parker {{began to}} {{identify}} as a lesbian {{in the late}} 1960s, and, in a 1975 interview with Anita Cornwell, stated that [...] "after my first relationship with a woman, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was going." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dolores! Yes, poor Gerald's love! They {{are almost}} myths to me. Ah!" [...] as Lancelot opened his office-door, [...] "now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am! And there's the old staircase! This {{is the real}} thing, and no mistake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I know my way, [...] I guess <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> {{can find}} my name [...] Carved {{in the shed}} to tell me who I am [...] If it don't tell me where I am. I used [...] To play--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To-morrow," [...] {{continued}} Joan, [...] "I {{will buy}} the wedding-ring. I {{know that that}} ought to be your business, but Iâ€™ll get it, because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> can get one cheap. I saw some the other day. Rolled gold they are called. Eighteenpence each." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Cardinal {{addressed}} him. [...] "You breed fine fellows in your family, Cosimo," [...] {{were the}} words with which he startled me, and then <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> had seen that face before. In my mirror.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{lifted me}} up as though I {{had been a}} feather," [...] responded the girl. [...] "He just put his arm round my waist and had me on my feet before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was." ...|$|R
60|$|Now indeed <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was standing. In all broad Scotland {{there was}} {{but the one}} name proscribed, {{and that was the}} name of the Macgregors. Yet so far from fleeing this {{undesirable}} acquaintancy, I plunged the deeper in.|$|R
60|$|ANTHONY. He goes, the coward! Ay, is {{this more}} of your contrivance? Madam, you make me blush. But to-day at least <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> can find him. This afternoon, on the Pantiles, he must dance {{attendance}} on the Duke of York. Already he must be there; {{and there he is}} at my mercy.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're anxious, I suppose, same as I am. Fact is," [...] said Fulkerson, {{blushing}} a little, [...] "I can't ask {{to have a}} day named till <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am {{in connection}} with the old man. I can't tell whether I've got to look out for something else or somebody else. Of course, it's full soon yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doesn't he?" [...] said Mrs. Vincent. [...] "I do, <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>Where</b> <b>I</b> live, at Wimbledon, {{may be said}} to be more {{country than}} town; but if I were to remain all the year without moving, I should become so low and out of sorts, that I veritably believe they would have to bury me before the first year was over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{you were}} right in warning me. He must needs think I worked in the parish for his sake; and one fine day, as I was walking home, he joined company, and before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was he was making me an offer.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{expect you}} thought me dull," [...] said Jimmy with an apologetic smile. [...] "Well, for some days I've been pondering things, and I'm not much {{used to the}} exercise. In a way, you're accountable. You inquired not long since if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> went?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was, the cocoan--I {{mean the}} chestnut, had me {{alongside}} the cow. I stuck the muzzle a'most into her ribs, and let drive. Down she {{went by the}} head, fairly scuttled, an' I could hear young Archie givin' a wild cheer astern." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "it is {{a double}} canoe. But I dare not take you ashore here; {{there are too many}} rocks, and it is {{impossible}} to see the ripple on them in this mist. We should sink the canoe. No, you must get in and I must paddle you home to Bryngelly, that's all. Now that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am I think that I can find the way." ...|$|E
6000|$|He looked about, to {{put himself}} more in {{relation}} with the place; then, after an hesitation, seemed to speak certain words instead of certain others. [...] "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> AM--! I do decline to be left, but what I came for, of course, was to thank you. If to-day has seemed, for the first time, the end of preliminaries, I feel how little {{there would have been}} any at all without you. The first were wholly yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I knowed, but I don't. I HAD it, because I {{stole it}} from them; and I stole it {{to give to}} you; and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> hid it, but I'm afraid it ain't there no more. I'm awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I'm just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest. I come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I come to, and run--and it warn't a good place." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nor <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> went to, 'cause I didn't 'alt to see, ...|$|R
60|$|Kumbo {{shook her}} 'ead, {{and then he}} took hold of 'er and tried to shove 'er back, but she wouldn't go. I lent him a 'and, but all wimmen are the same, black or white, and afore <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was she 'ad clawed my cap off and {{scratched}} me all down {{one side of the}} face.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] said Kinney, {{coming back}} and making haste to roll down his sleeves and put on his coat. [...] "Here's a nuisance! A whole party of folks--two sleigh-loads--right on us. I don't know who they be, or where they're from. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> wish they was. Well, of course, it's natural they should {{want to see a}} loggin'-camp," [...] added Kinney, taking himself to task for his inhospitable mind, [...] "and there ain't any harm in it. But I wish they'd give a fellow a little notice!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{tired of}} Burnley Beach," [...] Avery went on passionately, shaking apples wildly off a laden bough {{by way of}} emphasis. [...] "I know all the people--what they are--what they can be. It's like reading a book for the twentieth time. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was born and who I'll marry--and where I'll be buried. That's knowing too much. All my days will be alike when I marry Randall. There will never be {{anything}} unexpected or surprising about them. I tell you Janet," [...] Avery seized another bough and shook it with a vengeance, [...] "I hate {{the very thought of}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a mistake, you {{may depend}} on 't, sir. The sow-westers blow great guns here-abouts, it is true enough; and when they do, sich a sea comes {{tumbling}} in on that rock as man never seed anywhere else, perhaps; but, on the whull, I'd rather be close in here, than two hundred miles further to the southward. With the wind at sow-west, and heavy, a better slant might be made from the southern position; but here <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am, and I'd go in and anchor, {{and wait for the}} gale to blow itself out." ...|$|E
60|$|Herbert and I went on {{from bad}} to worse, {{in the way of}} {{increasing}} our debts, looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the like exemplary transactions; and Time went on, whether or no, as he has a way of doing; and I came of age,--in fulfilment of Herbert's prediction, that I should do so before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was.|$|R
2500|$|Despite such friction, their {{relationship}} {{continued to be}} close. When Stanton died in 1902, Anthony wrote to a friend: [...] "Oh, this awful hush! It seems impossible that voice is stilled which I have loved to hear for fifty years. Always I have felt I must have Mrs. Stanton's opinion of things before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> stood myself. I am all at sea..." ...|$|R
6000|$|The mound {{was one of}} {{the tallest}} in the region of dust, and as I {{struggled}} to the top, panting for breath and with my heart beating like a sledge-hammer, I saw away to my left the dull red gleam of the sky, and nearer still the flashing of lights. Thank God! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was now and where lay the road to Paris! ...|$|R
