25|$|The 'Golden Age of Porn' {{continued}} in 1972 with Deep Throat. It officially premiered at the World Theater in New York City on June 12, 1972 and was advertised in The New York Times under the bowdlerized title Throat. After Johnny Carson {{talked about the}} film on his nationally top-rated TV show and Bob Hope, as well, mentioned <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>TV,</b> Deep Throat became very profitable and a box-office success, {{according to one of}} the figures behind the film. In its second year of release, Deep Throat just missed Variety's top 10. However, by then, it was often being shown in a double bill with the most successful of the top three adult erotic films released in the 1972–1973 era, The Devil in Miss Jones, which easily outperformed Deep Throat, while leaving Behind the Green Door trailing in third place.|$|E
500|$|Every song on Station to Station {{eventually}} {{appeared on}} a single. [...] "Golden Years" [...] was released in November 1975, {{two months before the}} album. Bowie allegedly got drunk to perform <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>TV</b> for the American show Soul Train, resulting in the film clip seen on music video programmes. It reached No. 8 in the UK and No. 10 in the US (where it charted for sixteen weeks) but, like [...] "Rebel Rebel"'s relationship to Diamond Dogs (1974), was a somewhat unrepresentative teaser for the album to come.|$|E
500|$|Sylvia Anderson {{suggested}} that American audiences, who were less {{familiar with the}} Supermarionation productions of Century 21, were more enthusiastic. She explained, [...] "It was {{all too easy to}} compare our real actors with our puppet characters and descriptions such as 'wooden', 'expressionless', 'no strings attached' and 'puppet-like' were cheap shots some of the UK critics could not resist... Typecasting is the lazy man's friend, and boy, were we typecast in Britain." [...] On Doppelgänger, she said in 1992, [...] "I saw <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>TV</b> {{a couple of years ago}} and I was very pleased with it. I thought it came over quite well." ...|$|E

[...] He now lists woodworking as his prime hobby. Robertson adds that he still could average a triple-double season in today's basketball, {{and that he is}} highly skeptical that anyone else could do it (it was later done by Russell Westbrook in the 2016–17 season). On June 9, 2007, Oscar received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the University of Cincinnati for both his philanthropic and entrepreneurial efforts.|$|E
500|$|Spain's first match during {{qualification}} for the 2010 World Cup {{was against}} Bosnia and Herzegovina where Villa scored the only {{goal of the}} game. He {{would go on to}} score four goals in Spain's next three games, including a last minute winner against Belgium. Another goal during a friendly match against Chile saw him end the year with 12 goals, breaking Raúl's record of 10 goals held since 1999. Villa began 2009 with a goal against England in a 2–0 friendly, with this goal, he broke another record and became the first Spanish international to have scored in six consecutive games, seeing off records set by Telmo Zarra and László Kubala. Speaking of the goal, he said, [...] "I am very happy with the goal. Truth is, I really want to see <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>TV.</b> The record is very nice. I would never have imagined in years that I would be able to obtain it. I am very proud and I hope I can continue breaking records." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 2007, AAA {{created a}} ring persona {{for a new}} wrestler called Black Abyss; the gimmick {{featured}} the same mask and attire as Negro and used a similar wrestling style to Negro as well. Initially, {{it was believed that}} this was done because there were rumors of him jumping to CMLL or to cover several no-shows. In 2008, Negro's [...] "almost winning" [...] streak at Rey de Reyes continued as he lost in the final to El Zorro. Black Abyss made sure Negro did not win but interfering on Zorro's behalf during the match, furthering the storyline between the two. During the fall of 2008, AAA pushed the storyline further by having Black Abyss [...] "injure" [...] Negro with his own trademark move the [...] "Martinete". Abismo Negro was scheduled to take part in Triplemanía XVI in a match where he would face Los Vipers (Psicosis, Histeria, Black Abyss and Mr. Niebla) in a cage match, but in {{the weeks leading up to}} the show Abismo Negro suffered an injury and the match had to be cancelled, AAA used the attack at Rey de Reyes as a storyline explanation of why the match did not take place. At the 2008 Guerra de Titanes, Negro returned to challenge Los Vipers' Revolution and specifically Black Abyss. Subsequently, the storyline between Negro and Black Abyss seemed to be building to a Luchas de Apuestas fight between the two, with their masks on the line. Both Abismo and Black Abyss were booked in the same four-way elimination match qualifier at the Rey de Reyes (2009) event. Negro was able to eliminate Black Abyss from the match but was in turn eliminated by Latin Lover. Black Abyss still competed under the Black Abyss name, still as a rudo, but seemingly only a couple times on TV since then. Black Abyss has stated his wishes to continue with the character to honor the memory of Abismo Negro, but AAA didn't shown a lot of interest in using <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>TV.</b> In October 2010 it was reported that Black Abyss had left AAA.|$|E

2500|$|Buchanan {{wrote that}} it was {{impossible}} for 850,000 Jews to be killed by diesel exhaust fed into the gas chamber at Treblinka in a column for the New York Post in 1990. Buchanan once argued Treblinka [...] "was not a death camp but a transit camp used as a 'pass-through point' for prisoners". In fact, some 900,000 Jews had died at Treblinka. When George Will challenged him about <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>TV,</b> Buchanan did not reply. In 1991 William F. Buckley, Jr. wrote a 40,000-word National Review article discussing anti-Semitism among conservative commentators focused largely on Buchanan; the article and many responses to it were collected in the book In Search of Anti-Semitism (1992).

The programme, titled [...] "Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate", included recent footage of fans chanting various antisemitic slogans and displays of white power symbols and banners. The documentary recorded antisemitism and monkey noise taunts of black players in Poland. In Ukraine, the documentary recorded Nazi salutes and FC Metalist Kharkiv fans violently assaulting a group of Asian students at the Metalist Oblast Sports Complex, one of the stadiums hosting matches in Ukraine.

2500|$|Several {{cast and}} crew members warned the {{audience}} of the graphic content of the episode. Prior to the episode's release, certain scenes {{were reported to have}} been cut from the official broadcast, having been deemed too disturbing.

Steven Yeun, who portrays Glenn Rhee, said: I remember a couple of scenes I would look over at {{what was going on in}} the scene and I would be like, ‘What the eff? What are we doing? How is this legal? It's grounded and real, too; it's not like torture or gore for no reason. It's literally, that is what would happen and we are trying to show it. It would not work on network television, let me tell you that. Lauren Cohan, who portrays Maggie Greene, made similar comments regarding the episode, saying some of the scenes were [...] "so disturbing", she did not think they would make <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>TV.</b> The series' composer, Bear McCreary, tweeted to parents of young children: [...] "Do not let children watch The Walking Dead tonight.

[...] Series creator and executive producer Robert Kirkman stated that the episode's opening presented to the audience the threat that the characters face, although he said, [...] " [...] actually adds a tremendous amount of value to the story, and so that’s what justifies these great lengths that we go to to, you know, disgust the audience." [...] Gimple said that there was concern of the graphic nature of the episode, but both he and the network eventually felt it was necessary for the episode's plot, and that it contained meaning within the story.
