2500|$|Concentrated aqueous {{solutions}} of {{zinc chloride}} (more than 64% weight/weight zinc chloride in water) have the interesting property of dissolving starch, silk, and cellulose. Thus, such solutions cannot be filtered through standard filter papers. Relevant to its affinity for these materials, ZnCl2 {{is used as}} a <b>fireproofing</b> <b>agent</b> and in fabric [...] "refresheners" [...] such as Febreze. Vulcanized fibre is made by soaking paper in concentrated zinc chloride.|$|E

In addition {{to the production of}} magnesium metal, magnesium chloride also is used for a variety of other applications: fertilizer, mineral supplement for animals, wastewater treatment, wallboard, artificial seawater, feed supplement, textiles, paper, <b>fireproofing</b> <b>agents,</b> cements and refrigeration brine. Mixed with hydrated magnesium oxide, magnesium chloride forms a hard material called Sorel cement.|$|R
