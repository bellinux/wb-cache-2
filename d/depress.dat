5|$|The Stoics {{sought to}} be free of the unruly emotions, which they {{regarded}} as being contrary to nature. The passions or emotions (pathe) are the disturbing element in right judgment. Chrysippus wrote a whole book concerning the therapy of the emotions. The passions are like diseases which <b>depress</b> and crush the soul, thus he sought to eradicate them (apatheia). Wrong judgements turn into passions when they gather an impetus of their own, just as, when one has started running, it is difficult to stop. One cannot hope to eradicate the emotions when one is in the heat of love or anger: this can only be done when one is calm. Therefore, one should prepare in advance, and deal with the emotions in the mind as if they were present. By applying reason to emotions such as greed, pride, or lust, one can understand the harm which they cause.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the line's planning, Downtown Flushing was a quiet Dutch-colonial-style village; what is now Roosevelt Avenue in the area was known as Amity Street, a major {{commercial}} thoroughfare in the neighborhood. In late 1912, Flushing community groups were petitioning the Public Service Commission (PSC) to <b>depress</b> the proposed line in Flushing into a subway tunnel, rather than an elevated line. Unlike a subway, an el would cause disturbances to the quality of life and a loss in nearby property values, as well as a widening of Amity Street that would cause more changes to the already existing town. One Amity Street property owner compared the planned effect of an elevated Flushing Line on Amity Street to the degradation of Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn after the Myrtle Avenue Elevated was built there. On the other hand, a subway would only require that the street be widened, even though it was more expensive than an elevated of the same length.|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of frog isolated hearts was <b>depressed</b> by altering the perfusing Ringer solution in five different ways: {{by reducing the}} calcium content, by increasing the potassium content, and by adding ether, thiopentone or acetylcholine. <b>Depressed</b> hearts were perfused with Ringer solution containing the following stimulant drugs: paullinia tannin, tannic acid, hydrogen peroxide, sodium oleate, sodium caprylate and ouabain. All these stimulant drugs had similar actions on hearts <b>depressed</b> by calcium lack, ether and thiopentone; hearts <b>depressed</b> by acetylcholine were, however, only weakly stimulated. Hearts <b>depressed</b> by potassium were readily stimulated by oleate, caprylate and paullinia tannin; ouabain and hydrogen peroxide had weak stimulant actions on hearts <b>depressed</b> by potassium, and tannic acid had a negative inotropic action.

Methods: Here, 20 <b>depressed</b> subjects and then 20 healthy subjects were randomly selected from a total population of 1007 adult female Macaca fascicularis subjects. Four <b>depressed</b> subjects and eight healthy subjects were rearing infants. By focal observation, three trained observers video-recorded the selected subjects over a total observational period of 560 hours. The video footage was analyzed by qualified blinded analysts that coded the raw footage into quantitative behavioral data (i. e., durations of 53 pre-defined behavioral items across 12 behavioral categories) for statistical analysis. Results: Between infant-rearing and non-rearing healthy subjects, ten differential behaviors distributed across five behavioral categories were identified. Between infant-rearing and non-rearing <b>depressed</b> subjects, nine behaviors distributed across five behavioral categories were identified. Between infant-rearing healthy and infant-rearing <b>depressed</b> subjects, fifteen behaviors distributed across six behavioral categories were identified. Conclusion: Infant-rearing <b>depressed</b> adult female Macaca fascicularis subjects may have a worse psychological status as compared to non-rearing <b>depressed</b> counterparts.

5|$|Endotracheal {{intubation}} {{and mechanical}} ventilation {{may be used}} to ensure proper oxygen supply and provide a secure airway. Hypotension (low blood pressure), which has a devastating outcome in TBI, can be prevented by giving intravenous fluids to maintain a normal blood pressure. Failing to maintain blood pressure can result in inadequate blood flow to the brain. Blood pressure may be kept at an artificially high level under controlled conditions by infusion of norepinephrine or similar drugs; this helps maintain cerebral perfusion. Body temperature is carefully regulated because increased temperature raises the brain's metabolic needs, potentially depriving it of nutrients. Seizures are common. While they can be treated with benzodiazepines, these drugs are used carefully because they can <b>depress</b> breathing and lower blood pressure. TBI patients are more susceptible to side effects and may react adversely or be inordinately sensitive to some pharmacological agents.

5|$|In March 1909, Riley was {{stricken}} {{a second}} time with Bell's palsy, and partial deafness, the symptoms only gradually eased {{over the course of}} the year. Riley was a difficult patient, and generally refused to take any medicine except the patent medicines he had sold in his earlier years; the medicines often worsened his conditions, but his doctors could not sway his opinion. On July 10, 1910 he suffered a stroke that paralyzed the right side of his body. Hoping for a quick recovery, his family kept the news from the press until September. Riley found the loss of use of his writing hand the worst part of the stroke, which served only to further <b>depress</b> him. With his health so poor, he decided to work on a legacy by which to be remembered in Indianapolis. In 1911 he donated land and funds to build a new library on Pennsylvania Avenue. By 1913, with the aid of a cane, Riley began to recover his ability to walk. His inability to write, however, nearly ended his production of poems. George Ade worked with him from 1910 through 1916 to write his last five poems and several short autobiographical sketches as Riley dictated. His publisher continued recycling old works into new books, which remained in high demand.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1998 Depression is a {{significant}} problem among adolescents, especially females. The current study investigated interaction patterns along the dimensions of autonomy and relatedness in families of <b>depressed</b> adolescents. Externalizing adolescents and nonclinic adolescents were included as controls. Family interaction was assessed by observational coding of a mother-adolescents problem-solving task, {{as well as by}} mother and adolescent reports of family functioning. Adolescent self-concept was also assessed as a potential mediator in the link between family interaction and adolescent depression. Results suggest that <b>depressed</b> adolescents perceive the quality of their relationships with their parents to be significantly impaired. Mothers of <b>depressed</b> adolescents reported heightened conflict with their <b>depressed</b> adolescents, but not in the general home environment. Observation of <b>depressed</b> adolescents and their mothers during the problem-solving task revealed that although mothers showed normal levels of warmth and involvement, they tended to ignore or cut-off statements made by their adolescents. Several interesting gender differences emerged within the <b>depressed</b> group. During the observation task, <b>depressed</b> girls and their mothers showed higher levels of autonomy and a more positive connection relative to <b>depressed</b> boys and their mothers. Similarly, homes of <b>depressed</b> boys were perceived by mothers as especially low in cohesion and expressiveness and as high in control. It appeared that <b>depressed</b> girls seemed caught between wanting their autonomy and their desire for positive relatedness. <b>Depressed</b> boys appeared to be more resigned and passive in the face of high levels of control in the home.

The {{effect of the}} gender of the poser as well as the gender and the age of the participant were also of interest. Confirming earlier studies, girls decoded more anger than boys in non-basic facial expressions, but this gender difference was only found in the nondepressed group. <b>Depressed</b> boys decoded anger with the same high intensity as girls, and within girls no effect of depression was found. Contrary to expectations, female and male facial expressions were not decoded with different emotional intensity in general. Nevertheless, in decoding signs of rejection in the same facial expressions, the non-depressed group tended to decode more rejection in female faces, whereas the <b>depressed</b> group did not distinguish between male and female faces. An unexpected finding was that <b>depressed</b> adolescents also decoded more happiness in non-basic facial expressions than non- <b>depressed</b> adolescents. Also, and particularly in <b>depressed</b> boys, they decoded more acceptance in positive postural displays. In conclusion, <b>depressed</b> adolescents decode both more negative and more positive emotional and interpersonal meaning in subtle nonverbal cues, and these effects appear stronger for <b>depressed</b> boys than <b>depressed</b> girls.
