The cycle is marked by key events and phases including start-up, initial growth, mature growth, and possibly a crisis and restructuring stage or exit stage. The <b>governance</b> <b>cycle</b> for transitional countries reflects some specific characteristics – e. g. often privatization produces specific initial ownership structures, with an unusually high proportion of employee ownership.

30|$|Programs for {{stakeholder}} involvement {{should be}} designed {{in line with the}} complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity of the risks, and in accordance with the phase of the risk <b>governance</b> <b>cycle.</b> Epistemic discourses are needed when there is high complexity, but low uncertainty and ambiguity. Such discourses are usually held during the appraisal stage. If the stakes are highly uncertain but less ambiguous, a reflective discourse is required. This discourse should take place during the phases of risk evaluation and management. If the risk issue is laden with ambiguity, a participatory discourse is the most appropriate strategy. This discourse can begin in the pre-assessment phase and continue through the entire cycle until risk management and communication.|$|E
30|$|The {{article will}} address the {{question}} of how stakeholder involvement can best be integrated into the risk governance process. Section  2 introduces the three main challenges of risk governance: complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity and delineates the main requirements for structuring public involvement programs.

How to meet these communication and participation demands in each phase of the risk <b>governance</b> <b>cycle</b> is the main topic of Sect.  4. Section  5 provides a review of formats that one can select for each discourse purpose.

The article explained the requirements for involvement processes when approaching complex, uncertain, and ambiguous risk problems. Such risk problems require epistemic, reflective, and participatory discourse structures. For each of these discourse types appropriate formats are available {{that can be used to}} address the specific risk problem under investigation.

40|$|We {{begin by}} {{identifying}} a typical governance life-cycle, defined as changes in ownership structure, and including both {{the identity of}} the major owner and ownership concentration. The cycle is marked by key events and phases including start-up, initial growth, mature growth, and possibly a crisis and restructuring stage or exit stage. The <b>governance</b> <b>cycle</b> for transitional countries reflects some specific characteristics –e. g. often privatization produces specific initial ownership structures, with an unusually high proportion of insider, especially, employee ownership. Subsequently pres-sures for restructuring produce strong impulses for ownership changes. There is limited possibility for external finance because of the embryonic development of the banking system and the capital markets during early transition. The <b>governance</b> <b>cycle</b> is also influenced by specific features of the institutional, cultural and economic environment in a country. The varying importance of these fac-tors is expected to produce differences in key features of ownership cycles such as the speed at which particular ownership changes occur. To provide simple hypothesis tests, we use new and rich enterprise panel data sets for the three Bal-tic countries. The data enable various measures of ownership to be constructed (including the iden-tity of major owners and ownership concentration). The empirical analysis covers the ownership cycle with emphasis on initial ownership and subsequent changes. Our key method is to assemble a series of transition matrices showing both starting and final ownership configurations for sample enterprises and to simultaneously provide information on changes in concentration for the largest single owner. For Estonia this is supplemented with an analysis of the frequencies of different own-ership-cycles including intermediary stages of ownership. In spite of important differences in insti-tutional development, especially concerning the privatization process, we find that governance cy-cles are broadly similar in all countries. Employee ownership is rapidly fading and mainly being succeeded by managerial ownership. There are changes back and forth between manager and do-mestic external ownership, while foreign ownership is quite stable. Ownership concentration is mostly increasing after privatization, which included diversification both to employees and external owners. Since ownership diversification did not sit well with the slow development of the institu-tional framework, as expected we see a subsequent concentration of ownership on both managers, external domestic and foreign owners. However, variation in institutions, there are also important differences across countries. The adjustment of ownership structures is faster in Estonia and this {{can be explained by the}} relatively fast pace of institutional change and evolution of important gov-ernance institutions, including tough bankruptcy legislation and advances in the financial system.

40|$|Ownership is {{determined}} by firm specific factors and the environment. Firms change over their life-cycle. The <b>governance</b> <b>cycle</b> – here defined as changes in identity of the dominant owner and own-ership concentration - is marked by key phases including start-up, growth, and possibly a restructur-ing or exit stage. During transition the cycle reflects: privatization often with {{a high proportion of}} employee ownership like in Russia and in Slovenia; strong pressures for restructuring and owner-ship changes; limited possibility for external finance because of embryonic development of the fi-nancial system. To provide simple hypothesis tests, we use Russian enterprise data for 1995 - 2003 and Slovenian data covering 1998 - 2003. In spite of differences in institutional development, con-cerning privatization and development of corporate governance institutions, we find that govern-ance cycles are broadly similar in the two countries. Employee ownership is rapidly fading, but while change to manager and non-financial domestic outsider ownership is typical for Russia, man-ager ownership is not widespread in Slovenia. Instead change to financial outsiders in the form of Privatization Investment Funds is frequent. Foreign ownership, which is rare especially in Russia, is quite stable. The ownership diversification to employees and diversified external owners during privatization did not fit well to the low development of institutions. As expected we observe in both countries a subsequent concentration of ownership on managers, external domestic and foreign owners.

40|$|Abstract—The present way {{of doing}} {{business}} increasingly requires enterprises (and other organisations) to collaborate with each other; networked business allows enterprises to focus on their key competences and still capture market share with added-value, composed services jointly with trusted business partners. However, the present solutions for setting up new collaborations are based on ad hoc methods, or require integration through shared computing and communication platforms. These solutions leave collaborations with major risks on not detecting failures, functional or non-functional, breaches of trust or contractual state, or without systematic support on reacting to the changes in the business environment. This paper proposes service ecosystem governance principles, which are illustrated through the example analysis of the Pilarcos framework for service ecosystems. Service ecosystem governance supports correctness in dynamic collaborations despite strong autonomy of the partners, adaptability to changing business situations, and the manageable evolution of the service ecosystem that is necessary for sustainable networked business.

30|$|Methodologically {{this is a}} {{textually}} based {{critical analysis}} and comparison of legislation, migration policies, judgements and executive responses in Southern Europe and Australia. While comparative work on law questions is often undertaken across legal systems that share similar foundations and/or legal and language regimes (Giannacopoulos, 2016, p. 2) the approach we take here requires a break from this familiar approach. This article draws on primary legal texts {{as the basis for}} analysis but does not conduct a formal ‘black-letter’ legal analysis. It does however work in line with Hollifield’s insight that “in order to understand the politics of international migration we must compare immigration politics and policy outcomes among the liberal democracies” (Hollifield, 1992, p. 590). We focus ﻿here﻿ on the domestic structure of the judiciary and the internal domestic response of executives to judicial action on the international and complex question of migration. Since the objective here is to track a legal relationship that is of increasing relevance for migration, that of the executive and the judiciary, across two regions that are conventionally legally incomparable, a diverse range of texts have been brought into dialogue. Like Borkert and Penninx, we take an approach that stems from the idea that the multi-level governance of migration “is a process and not an event” and as such “is often of a cyclical in nature” (Borkert & Penninx, 2011, pp. 10 – 11). Borkert and Penninx identify the crucial importance of analyzing the role of various actors within these cyclical relations, even if comparative study in the field of migration is “by no means straightforward” (Borkert & Penninx, 2011, pp. 11 – 12). This is a complex study grounded in legal decisions with a focus on the relationships between actors and institutions (specifically the executive and judiciary) and their cyclical connections which assists in better understanding the contemporary trends of securitisation, extra-territorialisation and the undoing of protections for irregular migrants. Tracking this cycle reveals a transformation of the relationship itself as well as showing the profound effects this has on the lives of the peoples whose movements activate the <b>governance</b> <b>cycle</b> we track. This power contest is paradoxical in some ways because even if the executive attempts to curb judicial power that gesture also re-affirms the judiciary’s ongoing role in irregular migration matters.|$|E

40|$|Transableism {{is a term}} {{which refers}} to moving between states of being able and {{disabled}} by choice rather than by happenstance. Insofar as this may imply a choice to become dependent, claims upon the healthcare system are likely to result. In this piece we aim to explore some ethical and legal implications of such claims. In order to do so, we draw upon current debates over the place of autonomy, beneficence and paternalism in public health ethics, the taxonomy of disability {{and the status of}} persistent unexplained physical symptoms (henceforth, PUPS). We suggest that transableism represents a useful construct which may contribute towards resolution of ongoing difficulties within public health ethics and theories of disability. In addition, we believe that it holds promise for the understanding of a significant proportion of patients presenting PUPS. We focus upon identity disorders, particularly in relation to what is currently termed Body Integrity Identity Disorder (henceforth, BIID), where sufferers report a subjective conviction that one or more of their limbs are superfluous, requesting medical assistance to remove the offending limb[s], repair the results of attempts at their self-removal or to provide prostheses and other assistance after removal. We have considered BIID elsewhere in relation to consent, capacity and the doctor/patient relationship (Mackenzie and Cox, 2005).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to analyze whether the political-ideological situation of municipalities affects their debt level, considering evidence from Portugal for the period 2004 - 2013. A static panel data model is applied, incorporating factors such as political ideology, political-electoral <b>cycle,</b> <b>governance</b> format, coincidence of the political parties between Local Executive and Local Assembly and coincidence of the political parties between the Local Executive and Central Government. An additional variable to control the effects of the economic crisis between 2008 and 2010 is also considered. Based on the assumptions of the public choice theory, findings show a statistically significant relationship for the political-electoral cycle, allowing the conclusion that, given the evidence from Portuguese municipalities, debt increases in election years. Nevertheless, this is the only factor in the political-ideological circumstances that was found to be relevant in its effect on local authorities' debt levels. It is also clear that the financial crisis in the period 2008 - 2010 likewise had a positive impact. The paper contributes to the strengthening of the debate on the association between municipalities' political circumstances and debt, namely, in regards to strategic (electoral) debt cycles in local government...|$|R

We present a cybernetic model of governance focusing {{on the role of}} legislation and regulations as primary instruments for guiding and directing society. By eGovernance, we mean the application of advanced information and communications technology to improve <b>governance.</b> The life <b>cycle</b> of legislation model of governance leads to an appreciation of the potential of legal knowledge-based systems for eGovernance. Focusing on the implementation phase of the legislation life cycle, we discuss how legal knowledge-based systems can be used to improve the correctness, consistency, transparency and efficiency of deep transactions, i. e. those determinative processes of public administration requiring the application of complex legislation and regulations. Most efforts of public administration to bring transactions online have been restricted to simple transactions requiring little or no knowledge of the law, such as change of address notifications. Only when deep transactions are supported will the full potential of information and communications technology to improve the quality and efficiency of public administration be fully realized. Legal knowledge-based systems are a mature and proven technology with the capability to help realize the potential of eGovernance. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{consists}} of three factors, namely: Good Governance, Business Climate and Corruption. How they affect the development product of Albania, {{not only as a}} concept, and a principle but mostly as a sensitive aspect in the integration process. There are some interpretations of this concept, but I intend to analyze the key factors and actors, their cooperation and concrete production in society. Improving governance is necessary to have an integrated long term strategy based upon a continuous cooperation between institutions and citizens. But in developing countries like Albania there are some important questions such as: How can we measure the improvement of Good Governance through policies? Has Good Governance indicated an effective way for the sustainable development? (Meisel, 2008, 6).

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold: first to add to the debate on good {{governance}} and ethics of enterprise risk management (ERM) and second to describe an ethical maturity scale based on duty and responsibility for practical implementation to ensure better governance. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology has centred on risk governance as a way for many organisations to improve their risk management (RM) practices from an ethical perspective based on responsibility and on fulfilling one's duty within the organisation. Findings – While companies in Australia, for example, are more mature than those in Russia in terms of <b>governance</b> systems life <b>cycle,</b> there are a number of common international challenges in risk governance implementation. These relate to a link between risk framework, enterprise value model and strategic planning; to a definition of risk appetite, the embodiment of RM in organisational culture, internal audit and ERM function, the evolving role of a chief risk officer (CRO) and senior management buy-in and sponsorship of the integrated ethical RM from a chief executive officer. Practical implications – ERM – a way for many organisations to improve their RM practices – is a key component of the applied ethics of corporate governance. It has developed into a philosophy to assist organisations with the process of protecting shareholders' value while also increasing the bottom-line profitability. Effective ERM is based on ethical risk governance. Internal audit needs to be involved in the process of integrating RM and compliance. It should maintain a degree of independence when assisting with ERM establishment. CRO is most effective when reporting to the board. Originality/value – Global companies are becoming more accountable to multiple stakeholders. It is the adoption of an ethical code to arrest the lack of clarity of roles ascribed to the audit committee and risk committee and management's accountability or lack thereof that remains the challenge across different jurisdictions. In attempting to implement good governance and meet the challenges, the paper introduces an ethical maturity scale as an internal measure that could be embedded in an organisation's strategy.

40|$|Chapter 1 {{focuses on}} {{corporate}} <b>governance</b> and business <b>cycles.</b> The delegation of control to insiders fosters initiative {{but it also}} gives {{them the opportunity to}} expand their firm beyond the profit-maximizing size. When goods markets are imperfectly competitive, firms are too small relative to the social optimum. In such circumstances, insiders' tendency to increase investment, employment and output are at once costly for shareholders and beneficial for the economy. Under plausible assumptions, I show that firms find it optimal to delegate control when demand is high, and that delegation choices provide a powerful amplification mechanism. Finally, the model predicts that an increase in firm volatility can decrease aggregate volatility and I present evidence consistent with this prediction. Chapter 2 studies the implications of higher product market competition and capital market integration for unemployment in Europe. These changes are likely to increase efficiency and output in the long run, but it may take time for economic actors to fully understand them and adapt. In the presence of collective bargaining and slow learning by unions, these changes can generate first a rise, then a decline in unemployment. This fits the general evolution of unemployment in Europe since the 1970 s. The speed of learning by unions is likely to depend on the degree of trust between labor and capital. The empirical evidence suggests that countries where trust was lower have had more of an increase, and a later turnaround, in unemployment. Chapter 3 compares the impact of shocks to U. S. interest rates and emerging market bond spreads on domestic interest rates and exchange rates across several emerging market economies with different exchange rate regimes. (cont.) Consistent with conventional priors, the results indicate that interest rates in Hong Kong react much more to U. S. interest rate shocks and shocks to international risk premia than interest rates in Singapore. The results are less clear-cut in the comparison of Argentina and Mexico: while interest rates in Mexico seem to react less to U. S. interest rate shocks, they react about the same to bond spread shocks, in addition to {{a significant impact on the}} exchange rate. by Thomas Philippon. Thesis (Ph. D.)
