30|$|To {{improve the}} {{performance}} more significantly the cathode {{should also be}} infiltrated to reduce the polarisation resistance of both electrodes. Kiebach et al. [25] infiltrated cells assembled into a stack by flooding the electrodes using the <b>gas</b> <b>manifolds</b> to deliver the aqueous CGO and CGO/Ni precursor solutions. They found an improvement in stack performance following cathode infiltration but no significant further improvement after subsequent anode infiltration. In fact, the flooding method led to poor electrical contact {{with one of the}} cells due to accumulation of CGO {{at the bottom of the}} stack and, therefore, a reduction in the total power output. The precise deposition achievable with an inkjet printing approach reported here avoids those inherent materials wastage and accumulation problems. However, our results broadly agree; anode infiltration alone did not significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of commercial cells at intermediate temperatures, due to the dominance of cathode losses [26]. The benefit of anode infiltration in commercial cells may be more pronounced for long term stability and fuel impurity tolerance [8, 27, 28].|$|R

40|$|The use of {{flammable}} gas and high voltage in detector systems {{is common in}} many experiments at Fermilab. To mitigate the hazards associated with these systems, Fermilab Engineering Standard SD- 45 B (Ref. 1) was adopted. Since this note {{is meant to be}} a guide and not a mandatory standard, each experiment is reviewed for compliance with SD- 45 B by the {{flammable gas}} safety subcommittee. Currently, there are only two types of flammable gas in use, ethane (Appendix A) and methane (Appendix B). The worst flammable-gas case is C 2 H 6 (ethane), which has an estimated flow rate that is 73 % of the CH 4 (methane) flow but a heat of combustion (in kcal/g-mole) that is 173 % of that of methane. In the worst case, if ethane were to spew through its restricting orifice into its gas line at 0 psig and then through a catastrophic leak into Room 215 (TRD) or Room 511 (CDC/FDCNTX), the time that would be required to build up a greater than Class 1 inventory (0. 4 kg H 2 equivalent) would be 5. 2 hours (Ref. 2). Therefore a worst-case flammable gas leak would have to go undetected for over 5 hours in order to transform a either mixing room to an environment with a Risk Class greater than Class 1. The mixing systems, gas lines, and detectors themselves will be thoroughly leak checked prior to active service. All vessels {{that are part of the}} mixing systems will be protected from overpressure by safety valves vented outside the building. Both the input and output of all detector volumes are protected from overpressure in the same way. The volume immediately outside the central tracking detectors is continuously purged by nitrogen from boiloff from the main nitrogen dewar at the site. However, if flammable gas were to build up in the mixing rooms or particular detector areas, no matter how unlikely, flammable gas detectors that are part of the interlock chain of each gas mixing system will shut down the appropriate system. This includes shutting off the output of flammable <b>gas</b> <b>manifolds</b> within the <b>gas</b> shed. Similarly, if a fire were to break out anywhere in the D-ZERO Hall, fire sensors would stop the output of all flammable <b>gas</b> <b>manifolds</b> within the <b>gas</b> shed, by unpowering electrically controlled solenoid valves that are normally closed in the event of a power failure.

40|$|Among {{different}} {{designs of}} solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), planar design {{is the most}} promising due to easier fabrication, improved performance and relatively high power density. In planar SOFCs and other solid-electrolyte devices, gas-tight seals must be formed {{along the edges of}} each cell and between the stack and <b>gas</b> <b>manifolds.</b> For a sealant to work effectively in high-temperature SOFC environment, equilibrium needs to be achieved amid its mechanical properties and flow behavior so that it does not only maintain its hermeticity at high temperature but is also able to reduce mechanical stresses generated in the seal during thermal cycling. The most common sealants based on glass or glass-ceramic materials have been shown to operate in fuel cells for more than 1000 h with no significant degradation. Analysis of the current literature sources demonstrated that from thermal and chemical stability points of view, silicate based glass systems are more suitable than borate and borosilicate glass systems. In this work, different glass-ceramic (GC) compositions based on alkaline- and alkaline-earth aluminosilicate-based glass systems are reviewed with a special emphasis on their thermal, chemical, mechanical, and electrical properties. Based on these considerations, glass composition design approaches are provided that aid in search of the best seal glasses satisfying the rigid functional requirements. Among all the glass systems studied, a pyroxene based CaO-MgO-SrO-BaO-La 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 seal GC compositions have been specifically discussed because those have achieved appropriate thermal and chemical properties along with high stability.
