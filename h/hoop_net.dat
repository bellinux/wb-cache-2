40|$|Channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus is an {{important}} sport fish, particularly in the Great Plains. In Nebraska, a majority of anglers target channel catfish, and fishing activities are {{a vital part of}} the state’s economy. Lentic water bodies provide the primary fishing opportunity for catfish anglers in Nebraska. Despite the popularity and economic importance of channel catfish, little is known of its population dynamics or habitat requirements, and existing studies often profile river populations. Current standards for sampling channel catfish in lentic systems often yield inadequate catch to assess populations. The objective of this study was to utilize a recently developed sampling method, tandem-set hoop nets, to collect channel catfish in sufficient quantities to describe the effects of stocking and habitat variability on populations in lentic ecosystems. Three lentic ecosystems common to the Great Plains were considered: sand pits, flood-control reservoirs, and irrigation/power-generation reservoirs. The influence of stocking on abundance and condition of channel catfish varied with ecosystem type. In sand pits, stocking negatively influenced fish condition, and only frequent stocking positively influenced abundance. In flood-control reservoirs, stocking did not influence fish condition, but was associated with greater abundance. Stocking did not influence fish condition or abundance in irrigation/power-generation reservoirs. Additionally, there was evidence that mortality and growth rates varied with ecosystem type. In general, populations from irrigation/power-generation reservoirs were predicted to experience slower growth and lower mortality, whereas populations from sand pits were predicted to experience the fastest growth and highest mortality. Catch rates of channel catfish were substantially less in this study compared to previous records of tandem-set <b>hoop</b> <b>net</b> surveys, but hoop nets were more efficient than the current standard gear, experimental gill nets, at capturing channel catfish (i. e., 100 fish could be captured with fewer <b>hoop</b> <b>net</b> sets than gill net sets). However, catch rates and size structure of channel catfish in tandem-set hoop nets varied within the sampling season and between years. Furthermore, length-frequency distributions of channel catfish were dissimilar between hoop nets and gill nets. Adviser: Kevin L. Pop...|$|E

Current methods for controlling brook trout are usually time-consuming and expensive and are sometimes harmful to nontarget species. We tested a passive method of control using <b>hoop</b> <b>nets</b> to capture fish during brook trout spawning in the fall. We seeded nets with four different combinations of brook trout (a single male, three males, a male–female pair, and a single female) as well as with no fish to determine whether hoop-net capture success was greater in nets seeded with conspecifics. Nets with a male–female pair captured 30 % more brook trout than the next best treatment; the differences were significant, however, only in comparison with the catches resulting from the single- and multiple-male treatments. We also found that <b>hoop</b> <b>nets</b> captured five times as many mature male brook trout as mature females. Although we were unable to conclusively identify a treatment that increases hoop-net capture rates, <b>hoop</b> <b>nets</b> were successful in removing up to 34 % of the estimated number of brook trout in the study stream, even though we did not attempt to maximize capture efficiencies.

Five replicates of four traps, including "hoop nets", rigid "wire pots", and collapsible "round" and "rectangular" pots were deployed for 3, 6 and 24 h in two Australian estuaries. Trapped S. serrata were "discarded" into cages and monitored with controls over 3 d. All S. serrata were assessed for damage, while subsets of immediately caught and monitored individuals had haemolymph constituents quantified as stress indices. All traps retained similar-sized (8. 119. 1 cm carapace width) S. serrata, with catches positively correlated to deployment duration. Round pots were the most efficient for S. serrata and fishmostly Acanthopagrus australis (3 mortality). <b>Hoop</b> <b>nets</b> were the least efficient and were often damaged.

40|$|Belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) {{have been}} {{identified}} as Arctic ecosystem sentinels because they are broadly dispersed, high trophic feeders and are likely to be negatively impacted by climate change. They are highly dependent on hearing and underwater sound to enact key biological activities such as forage for prey, communicate with conspecifics and navigate. Therefore, understanding how noise might affect their sensory ecology is a priority to encourage their survival and address the broader potential acoustic impacts within the Arctic. Ocean noise levels are increasing in the Arctic due to an increase in human activities, which are related to the interests in Arctic resources and the opening of the Northwest Passage.

In 2000 we compared seasonal catch rates (catch per unit effort [CPUE], defined as the number of fish caught per series) and length frequencies (total length [TL]; mm) of channel catfish captured with two types of tandem series (long versus short bridles) and monitored the mortality of channel catfish along with the CPUE and mortality of bycatch in five lakes. Mean CPUE ranged from 12 to 194 fish/series for channel catfish and from 5 to 101 fish/series for bycatch among series types, lakes, and sampling periods. Mean CPUE for channel catfish and bycatch was similar between series types and did not consistently vary with sampling period.

A total of 403 burbot were captured from 1993 through 2004 (primarily with baited hoop nets), of which 300 were tagged and released, 31 were not tagged, and 72 were recaptures of fish tag up to four years prior. <b>Hoop</b> <b>net</b> catch per unit of effort (CPUE) decline precipitously from 0. 054 CPUE in 1996 to 0. 008 CPUE in 2004. Mean burbot length increased about 8 mm/yr from 516 mm in 1993 to 629 mm in 2004. Two models were developed for capture-recapture analysis, one which included effort data through a series river reaches and one without effort data. The effort model appeared to be more reliable and suggested an average annual mortality of 63 %, an average annual recruitment of 77 fish, and an average estimate of 148 burbot in the Kootenai River from 1996 through 2004. Average declines in recruitment and population abundance were estimated to be 21 % and 14 % per year, respectively, resulting in estimates of only 20 recruits and a population size of only 50 burbot in 2004. These data confirm that Kootenai River burbot are in serious decline and may already have passed the point of functional extinction where the population could be expected to recover if favorable habitat conditions were restored...|$|E

During the summer, night electric fishing had the highest estimated detection probability for both juvenile (p̂, 95 % C. I.; 0. 35, 0. 26 – 0. 46) and adult (0. 30, 0. 20 – 0. 41) burbot. However, small-mesh <b>hoop</b> <b>nets</b> (6. 4 -mm bar mesh) had similar detection probabilities to night electric fishing for both juvenile (0. 26, 0. 17 – 0. 36) and adult (0. 27, 0. 18 – 0. 39) burbot during the summer. In autumn, a similar overlap between detection probabilities was observed for juvenile and adult burbot.

40|$|ABSTRACT. For many decades, {{humans have}} {{captured}} white whales (Delphinapterus leucas) for food, research, and public display, {{using a variety}} of techniques. The recent use of satellite-linked telemetry and pectoral flipper band tags to determine the movements and diving behaviour of these animals has required the live capture of a considerable number of belugas. Three principal techniques have been developed; their use depends on the clarity and depth of the water, tidal action, and bottom topography in the capture area. When the water is clear enough so that the whales can be seen swimming under the water and herded into shallow sandy areas, a <b>hoop</b> <b>net</b> is placed over the whale’s head from an inflatable boat. When the water is murky and the belugas cannot easily be seen under the water, but can be herded into relatively shallow sandy areas, a seine net is deployed from a fast-moving boat to encircle them. If the whales are in deep water and cannot be herded into shallow water, a stationary net is set from shore to entangle them. Once captured, the whales have to be restrained in a way that allows them to breathe easily, have the tags attached, and be released as quickly as possible. The methods have proved to be safe, judging from the whales ’ rapid return to apparently normal behavioural patterns.

However, little is known concerning the size structure and growth characteristics of this population. We collected channel catfish from seven sites along the lower Platte River from 1988 to 1991, using a combination of hoop nets, boat electrofishing, and angler tournament harvests. Pectoral spines were removed from a subsample of catfish collected, sectioned, and aged for determination of backcalculated growth. Proportional Stock Density (PSD) calculated from <b>hoop</b> <b>net</b> and electrofishing collections averaged 7. 2 % and ranged from 4. 0 to 10. 7 %, compared to PSD from angler harvests which averaged 66. 6 % and ranged from 53. 8 to 79. 3 %. Incremental Relative Stock Density (RSD) analysis showed that anglers were harvesting more fish in the RSD Q-P category, while our sampling indicated that most stock size fish were in the RSD S-Q category. There were no consistent differences in mean monthly and annual K values between sexes of catfish both within or between sampling locations. Backcalculated estimates of the mean total length of age 1 channel catfish averaged 84 mm and ranged from 69 mm in spring 1989 to 101 mm for spring 1991. Mean annual growth increments for the next four years declined steadily from 65 mm between ages 1 and 2 to 54 mm, 50 mm, and 47 mm between ages 2 and 3, 3 and 4 and 4 and 5 respectively. It took four to six years for channel catfish to reach 300 mm in the Platte River. No consistent differences in mean lengths at age between locations were evident. The channel catfish population of the lower Platte River exhibits a longitudinally-uniform pattern of slow growth, with an age structure skewed towards younger age groups...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, several state {{agencies}} {{have adopted the}} use of baited, tandemset hoop nets to assess lentic channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus populations. Some level of escapement from the net is expected because an opening exists in each throat of the net, although factors infl uencing rates of escapement from hoop nets have not been quantified. We conducted experiments to quantify rates of escapement and to determine the infl uence of throat configuration and fish density within the net on escapement rates. An initial experiment to determine the rate of escapement from each net compartment utilized individually tagged channel catfish placed within the entrance (between the two throats) and cod (within the second throat) compartments of a single <b>hoop</b> <b>net</b> for overnight sets. From this experiment, the mean rate (±SE) of channel catfish escaping was 4. 2 % (± 1. 5) from the cod (cod throat was additionally restricted from the traditionally manufactured product), and 74 % (± 4. 2) from the entrance compartments. In a subsequent experiment, channel catfish were placed only in the cod compartment with different throat configurations (restricted or unrestricted) and at two densities (low [6 fish per net] and high [60 fish per net]) for overnight sets to determine the infl uence of fish density and throat configuration on escapement rates. Escapement rates between throat configurations were doubled at low fish density (13. 3 ± 5. 4 % restricted versus 26. 7 ± 5. 6 % unrestricted) and tripled at high fish density (14. 3 ± 4. 9 % restricted versus 51. 9 ± 5. 0 % unrestricted). These results suggest that retention efficiency is high from cod compartments with restricted throat entrances. However, managers and researchers {{need to be aware}} that modification to the cod throats (restrictions) is needed for hoop nets ordered from manufacturers. Managers need to be consistent in their use and reporting of cod end throat configurations when using this gear...|$|E
