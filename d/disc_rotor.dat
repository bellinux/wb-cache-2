50|$|The {{defibrator}} is a thermo mechanical pulping refiner {{in which}} the pulp material, such as wood chips, is ground {{in an environment of}} steam between a rotating grinding <b>disc</b> (<b>rotor)</b> and a stationary disc (stator) each with radial grooves that provides the grinding surface. Wood chips are fed into the centre and are broken down as the centrifugal force pushes them towards the circumference of the discs where the grooves are finer to produce wood fibre. The size of the refined fibres can to some extent be controlled by altering the distance between the discs where a closer distance produces finer fibres but also requires higher grinding force. The capacity per machine is largely determined {{by the size of the}} machine, as well as the motor speed 1500 rpm or 1800 rpm.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the first}} 32 years of {{production}} {{of the first generation}} IRS, the disc brakes were mounted at the inboard ends of the driveshafts in order to minimise unsprung weight at the outboard end. The hydraulic brake calipers were mounted directly onto the differential. Care was taken to prevent heat generated by the brakes from damaging the differential output seals, although this was never totally successful. [...] The parking brake used separate mechanical calipers acting on the discs.For the 1993-1996 model XJS, the brakes were moved to the outboard position. This was achieved using the hub carriers from the Second Generation IRS, which by that time had already been in production for seven years for the XJ6 (XJ40). Moving the rear brakes outboard eliminated the heat transfer problem and allowed for easier servicing. The parking brake then used brake shoes inside a brake drum in the centre of the <b>disc</b> <b>rotor.</b>|$|E

50|$|In disc brakes, {{there are}} usually two brake pads per <b>disc</b> <b>rotor.</b> These are held in place and {{actuated}} by a caliper affixed to the wheel hub or suspension upright. Most vehicles have two brake pads per caliper. However racing calipers can utilize up to six pads, with varying frictional properties in a staggered pattern for optimum performance.Depending on {{the properties of the}} material, disc wear rates may vary. The brake pads must usually be replaced regularly (depending on pad material) to prevent brake fade. Most brake pads are equipped with a method of alerting the driver when this needs to be done. A common technique is manufacturing a small central groove whose eventual disappearance by wear indicates the end of a pad's service life. Others methods include placing a thin strip of soft metal in a groove, such that when exposed (due to wear) the brakes squeal audibly and embedding a soft metal tab in the pad material that closes an electric circuit and lights a dashboard warning light when the brake pad wears thin.|$|E
5000|$|Disk {{electromagnetic}} brakes {{are used}} on vehicles such as trains, and power {{tools such as}} circular saws, to stop the blade quickly when the power is turned off. A disk eddy current brake consists of a conductive non-ferromagnetic metal <b>disc</b> (<b>rotor)</b> attached to the axle of the vehicle's wheel, with an electromagnet located with its poles {{on each side of}} the disk, so the magnetic field passes through the disk. The electromagnet allows the braking force to be varied. When no current is passed through the electromagnet's winding, there is no braking force. When the driver steps on the brake pedal, current is passed through the electromagnet windings, creating a magnetic field, The larger the current in the winding, the larger the eddy currents and the stronger the braking force. Power tool brakes use permanent magnets, which are moved adjacent to the disk by a linkage when the power is turned off. The kinetic energy of the vehicle's motion is dissipated in Joule heating by the eddy currents passing through the disk's resistance, so like conventional friction disk brakes, the disk becomes hot. Unlike in the linear brake below, the metal of the disk passes repeatedly through the magnetic field, so disk eddy current brakes get hotter than linear eddy current brakes.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{numerical}} {{investigation of the}} automotive ventilated <b>disc</b> brake <b>rotor.</b> <b>Disc</b> brakes operate {{on the principle of}} friction by converting kinetic energy into heat energy. The main objective of a <b>disc</b> brake <b>rotor</b> is to store this heat energy and dissipate it as soon as possible. This work is carried out in a area where there is very limited understanding. Commercial CFD code FLUENT was used for carrying out the simulations with the rotor rotating in still air. Only one passage and blade were simulated as all the rotor passages were identical. Uniform temperatures were used on the rotor to simulate the braking condition. Sixteen different blade angle sets were simulated and the range of blade angles having the best aero-thermal performance were identified using mass flow rate, rate of heat dissipation and temperature uniformity as performance metrics. The effect of rotational speed and rotor temperature (corresponding to various braking conditions) on the aero-thermal performance was evaluated. The rotor speed and temperature were observed to have significant effect on the rotor performance. The number of blades in the ventilated <b>disc</b> brake <b>rotor</b> was also varied and was observed {{to have an impact on}} the aero-thermal performance of the <b>disc</b> brake <b>rotor.</b> Detailed design changes like inlet chamfer, blade leading edge rounding, and variable thickness blade and passage aspect ratio were incorporated.

40|$|Abstract — A brake is {{a device}} {{by means of}} which {{artificial}} frictional resistance is applied to moving machine member, {{in order to stop}} the motion of a machine. Braking is a process which converts the kinetic energy of the vehicle into mechanical energy which must be dissipated in the form of heat.

40|$|Aluminium alloys {{have been}} used {{extensively}} in the automotive industry to reduce {{the weight of a}} vehicle and improve fuel consumption which in turn leads to a reduction in engine emissions. The main aim of the current study is to replace the conventional cast iron rotor material with a lightweight alternative such as coated aluminium alloy. The main challenge has been to meet both the cost and functional demands of modern mass-produced automotive braking systems. A sensitivity analysis based on the Taguchi approach was carried out to investigate the effect of various parameters on the thermal performance of a typical candidate disc brake. Wrought aluminium <b>disc</b> brake <b>rotors</b> coated with alumina on the rubbing surfaces were determined to have the best potential for replacing the conventional cast iron rotor at reasonable cost.
