50|$|For two generations, the Yang {{family of}} Yang Lu-ch'an and the Wu family of Wu Quanyou spread the fame of the martial art of t'ai chi ch'uan {{throughout}} the Qing Empire. The Qing government ended by a revolution and similar disruption were happening throughout Chinese society. It was during these turbulent times that Chen Zhaopei (陈照丕; 1893-1972) went to Beijing to teach Chen's style Tai Chi Chuan in 1928. Chen Zhaopei’s instructions attracted considerable interest and in 1930 {{he was invited}} to teach in Nanjing. Zhaopei did not want to leave his Beijing students so he suggested that they invite his uncle Chen Fake to take his place. At this time Chen <b>Fake</b> <b>moved</b> from a small village in Henan Province to the thriving metropolis of Beijing.|$|R

Chen Fake was a martial artist and not a scholar and so he did not leave a written record of his achievements. His life story was recorded and told by his sons or students, notably Hong Junsheng. By the time of his death in 1957, Chen had established a martial arts tradition of Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan that is practiced worldwide.|$|R
50|$|The sixth game, at St. Louis, was {{considered}} one of the greatest games ever played to that time. With the Browns ahead three games to two, Anson called on Clarkson to start his fourth game in six days. Clarkson responded with seven shutout innings, but gave up three runs in the eighth inning, and the game went to extra innings. In the bottom of the tenth inning, the Browns' center fielder Curt Welch singled (only the fourth hit off Clarkson) and moved to third on a sacrifice. Welch and Browns’ third base coach Arlie Latham tried to distract Clarkson with heckling and <b>faking</b> <b>moves</b> toward home. When Welch finally attempted the steal, Chicago's catcher, King Kelly, had called for a pitchout, but Clarkson threw a wild pitch, and Welch scored the World Series winning run.|$|R

5000|$|Pauline Kael {{wrote in}} 5001 Nights at the Movies: [...] "When Robert Altman gives a project {{everything}} he's got, his skills {{are such that}} he can make poetry out of fake poetry and magic out of <b>fake</b> magic. <b>Moving</b> in apparent freedom, the principal actresses ... go at their roles so creatively that they find some kind of acting truth in what they're doing. They bring conviction to their looneytunes characters." [...] Film critic Leonard Maltin gave Jimmy Dean {{two and a half}} stars out of four in his Movie Guide. [...] "Strong performances, and Altman's lively approach to filming Graczyk's Broadway play," [...] he said, [...] "can't completely hide the fact that this is second-rate material." [...] The staff of Halliwell's Film Guide wrote, [...] "Jimmy Dean descends from cynicism through gloom to hysteria and is never very revealing." ...|$|R

This method is generally not in use today, as the false table must be extremely thick to conceal the assistant.|$|R

500|$|On offense, Olajuwon {{was famous}} for his deft {{shooting}} touch around the basket and his nimble footwork in the low post. With the ball, Hakeem displayed {{a vast array of}} <b>fakes</b> and spin <b>moves,</b> highlighted in his signature [...] "Dream Shake" [...] (see below). He was a prolific scorer, averaging 21.8 points per game for his career, and an above average offensive rebounder, averaging 3.3 offensive rebounds per game. Additionally, Olajuwon became a skilled dribbler with an ability to score in [...] "face-up" [...] situations like a perimeter player. He is 1 of only 4 players to have recorded a quadruple-double in the NBA. It should be noted that quadruple-doubles were not possible before the 1973–74 season, when blocked shots and steals were first kept as statistics in the NBA.|$|R
5000|$|Alston {{grew up in}} Jamaica, Queens, New York and was a {{standout}} streetball basketball player, known for his nontraditional moves which made him particularly adept at getting past defenders while dribbling the ball. He was the inspiration in many ways for the AND1 Mixtape Tour—a low-quality, jerky 1999 videotape of Alston's extreme playground moves, featuring helter-skelter crossover and other fast dribble <b>moves</b> <b>faking</b> out defenders, attracted {{a great deal of}} attention among players and basketball fans. These unique moves became Alston's signature, and in fact, his nickname [...] "Skip 2 My Lou" [...] comes from one of the moves. As the video began to circulate (some can be seen on AND1 Mixtape Volume 1), other non-NBA players began to contribute their own moves and highlights, and eventually the AND1 Live Tour (originally the AND1 Mixtape Tour) developed from that beginning.|$|R

5|$|The Leafs {{finished}} {{in first place}} {{at the end of}} the regular season. Kennedy had finished the regular season third in points on the team behind the other two star centers Apps and Bentley, but it was Kennedy who was to dominate the playoffs. In the first round Toronto played Boston and eliminated the Bruins in five games. Kennedy set up the tying goal which led to an overtime win in game 1 and scored four times in the second game. But it was in the fifth and deciding for which he received greatest praise for his fore-checking tenacity and clutch goalscoring. First, with Toronto down 2–1 and the Bruins having the better of the play, he out-fought two Boston players for possession to get the puck to Bentley who in turn set up Lynn for the tying goal. Then later, Kennedy was carrying the puck into the Boston end. He passed to Meeker, who returned the pass, Kennedy <b>faked</b> once, <b>moved</b> in front of the net, forced goaltender Brimseck to go down, then lifted the puck over him. In the finals, Toronto swept Montreal in four straight games to win the Stanley Cup. Kennedy scored twice in the Cup-winning game and finished leading all players in the playoffs in points with eight goals and five assists and he was also not given a single penalty in the entire playoffs. His checking and work in the corners has been credited as critical to the victory.|$|R
500|$|Olajuwon {{established}} himself as an unusually skilled offensive player for a big man, perfecting a set of <b>fakes</b> and spin <b>moves</b> that became known as his trademark Dream Shake.

Shaquille O'Neal stated: [...] "Hakeem has five moves, then four countermoves – that gives him 20 moves." [...] Olajuwon himself traced the {{move back to the}} soccer-playing days of his youth. [...] "The Dream Shake was actually one of my soccer moves which I translated to basketball. It would accomplish one of three things: one, to misdirect the opponent and make him go the opposite way; two, to freeze the opponent and leave him devastated in his tracks; three, to shake off the opponent and giving him no chance to contest the shot." [...] The Dream Shake was very difficult to defend, much like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's sky-hook.|$|R

The Others targeted specific people for a fake eviction, of which Tate was seen as the instigator. On Day 4, Alex Cannon and Jackson Blythe were <b>fake</b> evicted and <b>moved</b> to the Other house, with the public voting Tate and Ryan Ruckledge in to take their places.

In his second season, 1985–86, the Rockets upset the Lakers in the Western Conference finals. After Michael Jordan's first retirement, Olajuwon established himself as the NBA's most dominant player, leading the Rockets to two consecutive NBA championships in 1994 and 1995. In the 1993–94 season he became the only player in NBA history to win the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP), Defensive Player of the Year, and Finals MVP awards in the same season. In both Finals, Olajuwon outplayed two of the league's leading Centers, Patrick Ewing of the New York Knicks and the Orlando Magic's young Shaquille O'Neal.

5000|$|His {{struggle}} to preserve parliamentary democracy was {{viewed by the}} communists {{as a form of}} counter-revolutionary activity. His parliamentary immunity was lifted on 5 June 1947 and he was arrested in the Parliament building itself; colleagues who tried to prevent the arrest were beaten up. After a show trial in which the defence was denied the rights to legal representation or to present evidence, he was found guilty of espionage and sentenced to death on 16 August that year. Though he protested his innocence during his staged group trial with 4 other 'co-conspirators,' and despite the protests of Western nations, Nikola Petkov was hanged on 23 September 1947 and buried in an unknown grave. The Bulgarian secret police arranged for a false confession to be publicly printed after Petkov's death, but it was so obviously <b>faked</b> that the <b>move</b> quickly became an embarrassment and ceased to be mentioned by the authorities. [...] Petkov had been denied a Christian burial or last rites, despite being one of Bulgaria's few genuinely religious public figures. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 15 January 1990.|$|R

40|$|In a {{symposium}} like this, one {{is tempted to}} resort to moralizing. At the same time, academic responsibility prods the need for the safety and objectivity of scientific analysis. My dilemma is clear. Having been schooled, on one hand, in the rigor of cool, scientific and systematic approaches to problems I have the need to categorize, to identify taxonomies, to respect technology, to seek and create universal structure in my field. On the other hand, I cannot divorce myself from the immersion in the humanist education I received at City College of New York which so enhanced my puzzlement about the destiny of man and focused my attention on the behavioral sciences. I cannot cease to wonder and ask myself: “Why did my teachers of the past say what they said and do what they did, what was it in their actions that either invited me to participate in the best of life or rejected me completely? ” But, I have survived. What about those who do not? So, I decided to do both; to engage in moralizing and in analysis. Let me quote: “Hey, I’m not me – I’m you – I forget then you laugh and <b>fake</b> out some <b>move.</b> It all seems okay – for now. But with experience behind us we are now old- maybe we haven’t got the time to act anymore. Okay, says you – we’ll try it your way – be yourself – go ahead – fall down – break, crack, broken back. It doesn’t work – you can’t be you. Your memory won’t let you. ” This is a part of a poem written by a high school boy a few days before he kille...|$|R
5000|$|Hong Junsheng (洪均生) {{was born}} in 1907, Yuxian County (禹县), Henan Province (河南省). His {{grandfather}} was a government official in the Qing Court. At an early age, Hong's family moved to Beijing. Hong's family was affluent providing Hong with a leisurely life style and a classical Chinese education. When Hong was young, he was physically weak and often sick. By the time Hong was seventeen, Hong could no longer continue his education because of his illness. Still feeling weak and sick even after getting married {{at the age of}} 20, Hong decided to improve his health by becoming more physically active. He started by walking around the Beijing neighborhood. In 1930, Hong began to learn Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan (吴式太极拳) from Liu Musan (刘慕三) to further improve his health. Liu, originally from Wuxi (无锡) in Jiangsu Province (江苏省), was the director of the Telegram Service Department at Beijing Telegram Bureau and a well regarded protégé of Wu Chien-ch'uan (吴鉴泉, 1870-1942). The t'ai chi ch'uan world was in flux, just as Hong started his training with Liu. Before 1930, the public recognized t'ai chi ch'uan being taught by the Yang family and the Wu family [...] but the arrival of Chen Fake and his promotion of Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan would radically change this public perception. Chen <b>Fake</b> had <b>moved</b> from Chen village to Beijing to openly teach his family style. In accordance with Chinese martial arts tradition, Chen accepted and won all challenges. Chen's feats and exploits were widely reported in the press. Liu decided to investigate the validity of those claims. Liu invited Chen for a demonstration of the form as well as some friendly push hand competition. Liu was impressed by Chen's ability and decided to lead his students including Hong to study Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan.For the next fifteen years, Hong studied diligently under the careful guidance of Chen Fake. Initially, Chen lived with Hong because of Hong's affluence. This allowed Hong to closely observe the teachings of Chen. Over time, Hong's health improved and this provided added impetus for Hong to continue his t'ai chi ch'uan training. Even as his family responsibility increased with his six sons and his fortune declined, Hong continued to train closely with Chen. Just as Hong’s wealth wane, Chen’s reputation was rising. Chen invited Hong’s family to stay with him. These allowed Hong once again to receive detail instructions from Chen. Over a thirty-year period, Chen Fake taught several hundred students in Beijing. Of those hundreds, only a handful can considered themselves to be disciples (入门弟子), Hong was one of the earliest of those disciples and studied with Chen the closest and longest.|$|R
