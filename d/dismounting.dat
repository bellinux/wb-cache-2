5|$|According to {{personal}} {{accounts of the}} battle, after <b>dismounting</b> Dodge offered his men a chance {{to back out of}} the operation. No one opted out, and 21 men advanced with Dodge in an extended firing line, unsure of the enemy's location. The remaining eight soldiers were posted as guards on high grounds and near the horses. Unlike the disorganized and undisciplined troops at Stillman's Run, the volunteers at Horseshoe Bend adhered to military discipline; they waited for Dodge to give the order before they entered the thicket and swampland in search of their enemy, and once searching they awaited their commander's order to attack.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} stage, {{the first major}} climb, the Ballon d'Alsace, made its debut. Four riders were the fastest climbers: Trousselier, René Pottier, Cornet and Aucouturier. Of those four, Trousselier and Aucouturier {{were the first to}} be dropped, and Cornet had to drop in the final kilometers. The top was {{therefore}} reached first by René Pottier, without <b>dismounting,</b> at an average speed of 20km/h. Cornet, who reached the top second, had to wait 20 minutes for his bicycle with higher gear, because his support car had broken down.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1915, {{after several}} {{occasions}} when the British had to temporarily <b>dismount</b> regiments and send them into the front lines, an establishment for the <b>Dismounted</b> Cavalry Division was created. The three British cavalry divisions each formed a <b>dismounted</b> cavalry brigade, with the 1st Brigade being raised from the 1st Division, and so on. The cavalry brigades formed a <b>dismounted</b> cavalry battalion, numbered after their parent brigades, so the 9th Cavalry Brigade formed the 9th <b>Dismounted</b> Battalion, for example. The cavalry regiments each formed one <b>dismounted</b> company and a machine gun section for their battalion. However, the <b>Dismounted</b> Cavalry Division, with only three brigades, was smaller than an infantry division, which had four brigades. This disadvantage was felt throughout the formation, with the <b>dismounted</b> cavalry brigade only having three battalions instead of the four in an infantry formation, and the <b>dismounted</b> cavalry battalion only having three, albeit larger, companies {{as opposed to the}} four of an infantry battalion. There was one other divisional-sized formation raised in 1916 that contained British cavalry regiments. This was the Imperial Cavalry Division, which served in the campaign in Mesopotamia. This was another British Indian Army division, and like all Indian divisions, it had one British regiment per brigade.|$|R

5|$|Next to {{the older}} and much steeper stairs leading to the Aracoeli, Michelangelo devised a monumental wide-ramped stair (the cordonata), {{gradually}} ascending the hill to reach the high piazza, so that the Campidoglio resolutely turned its back on the Roman Forum that it had once commanded. It was built to be wide enough for horse riders to ascend the hill without <b>dismounting.</b> The railings are topped by the statues of two Egyptian lions in black basalt at their base and the marble renditions of Castor and Pollux at their top.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, on 18 November, the {{regiment}} {{moved into a}} line of observation posts along the River Auja. The next day a troop from the 2nd Squadron were sent to locate crossing points across the river. They located a dam and a bridge to the north-east. <b>Dismounting</b> and approaching on foot, they had one man wounded, who was later taken prisoner. The following day {{the regiment}} was relieved by the other rest of the brigade, {{and moved to the}} rear, returning to the front line on 21 November.|$|E
5|$|When {{the battle}} was joined, the cavalry engaged in a fierce {{exchange}} on the flanks. Polybius described the Hispanic and Celtic horse <b>dismounting</b> in what he considers a barbarian method of fighting. When the Hispanic and Gauls got the upper hand, they cut down the Roman cavalry without giving quarter. On the other flank the Numidians engaged {{in a way that}} merely kept the Roman allied cavalry occupied. When the victorious Hispanic and Gallic cavalry came up, the allied cavalry broke and the Numidians pursued them off the field.|$|E

5|$|At this {{juncture}} Richard saw Henry at some distance behind his main force. Seeing this, Richard decided {{to end the}} fight quickly by killing the enemy commander. He led a charge of mounted men around the melee and tore into Henry's group; several accounts state that Richard's force numbered 800–1000knights, but Ross says it was more likely that Richard was accompanied only by his household men and closest friends. Richard killed Henry's standard-bearer Sir William Brandon in the initial charge and unhorsed burly John Cheyne, Edward IV's former standard-bearer, with {{a blow to the}} head from his broken lance. French mercenaries in Henry's retinue related how the attack had caught them off guard and that Henry sought protection by <b>dismounting</b> and concealing himself among them to present less of a target. Henry made no attempt to engage in combat himself.|$|E
5|$|Each unit is {{assigned}} a character class, while affects their assigned weapon, strengths and weaknesses, and range {{and speed of}} movement on the battlefield. These classes range from axemen and swordsmen to thieves, to mounted units and magic users such as healers. Some characters, such as main protagonist Leif, have unique classes. Classes also naturally evolve {{during the course of}} the story. Mounted units have the option of <b>dismounting</b> their steeds to fight on-foot. Weapons within a unit's selected character class can be freely swapped out for more powerful versions: when mounted units dismount, they swap spears for axes or swords. Weapon effectiveness is governed by the Weapons Triangle: swords are strong against axes, axes against spears, and spears against swords.|$|E
5|$|In late November 1918 the 4th Division began a road {{march of}} more than 125 miles from the French city of Metz toward the German city of Koblenz, on the Rhine River. The final {{destination}} of Middleton's 47th Regiment would be the town of Adenau, 35 miles due west of Koblenz. The road trip took fifteen days of moving through almost incessant rain and ended in a driving snowstorm on 15 December. During the march, Middleton broke character and rode a horse during most of each day, surveying his troops and occasionally <b>dismounting</b> to talk with them. The formation marched for fifty minutes of each hour, and rested for ten, with a full hour for lunch.|$|E

5|$|The {{reason for}} sexual {{cannibalism}} has been debated; experiments show that females on low quality diets {{have a higher}} chance to engage in sexual cannibalism compared to females on high quality diets. Some consider that submissive males gain a selective advantage by producing offspring. This theory {{is supported by a}} quantifiable increase in the duration of copulation among males which are cannibalized, in some cases doubling both the duration and the chance of fertilization. This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution, and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time, indicating that males that actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females. The same study also found that hungry females generally attracted fewer males than those that were well fed. The act of <b>dismounting</b> after copulation is dangerous for males, for at this time, females most frequently cannibalize their mates. An increase in mounting duration appears to indicate that males wait for an opportune time to dismount a hungry female, who would be likely to cannibalize her mate.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00 on 14 November the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, {{the brigade}} vanguard, {{encountered}} Turkish observation posts. The brigade ordered {{an attack on}} the main Turkish defences. The regiment was positioned to cover the left flank. Advancing by troops they came under machine-gun fire. The 3rd Squadron was dispatched to occupy the high ground on the regiment's right while the other squadrons took cover. Then a force of Turkish cavalry appeared to their left. McCarroll sent the 11th Squadron to check on their dispositions and numbers. However, the squadron encountered heavy rifle and machine-gun fire and could not move forward. To assist them, two troops from the 4th Squadron, were ordered to charge on horseback. The two troops captured the position and continued forward, occupying the high ground on the left in front of the Wellington Mounted Rifles. The 3rd Squadron, in reserve, provided covering fire as the 11th Squadron moved forward alongside the 4th on their left. Covered by the 4th Squadron, the 11th Squadron moved forward. At 14:15 the advance troops of the 11th Squadron located, in an orange grove, a Turkish concentration of troops that counter-attacked the regiment. McCarroll, who had kept up with his forward line of troops, ordered the rest of the regiment, including headquarters troops, to move up in support of the 11th Squadron. The 3rd Squadron galloped forward, <b>dismounting</b> just behind the front line, and engaged the Turkish attack with enfilade fire, forcing the Turks to retire.|$|E

5|$|The {{plans for}} bicycling {{included}} a suspension ramp {{that would allow}} bicyclists to leave the Big Four Bridge without <b>dismounting</b> their bikes. Due {{to the length of}} time any new downtown bridge would take to be built, and needing an alternative for cyclists and pedestrians to get across the Ohio River when the George Rogers Clark Bridge is closed, which happens yearly during Thunder Over Louisville, bicyclists preferred the idea of converting the Big Four rather than relying on a new downtown bridge or the Clark Bridge. By mid-July 2009, work had begun to convert the bridge to a pedestrian walkway. With the approach ramps, the bridge upon completion of work was to span about 1 mile. In February 2013, pedestrians were allowed to access the completed bridge from the ramp on the Kentucky side with construction still continuing on the Indiana ramp. The Indiana ramp opened on May 20, 2014. Lighting along the bridge is required for safety and had been redesigned to please nearby residents. Originally, the lighting was to be similar to those on the Kentucky side, which has computer-controlled lights that can show various colors. The Indiana construction also had to be cautious of historic properties.|$|E
