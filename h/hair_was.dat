5|$|In ancient China and Korea, <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> {{regarded}} as a precious legacy from parents. Most people would never cut their hair after they became adults, and cutting off one's <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> a penalty for minor crimes. Both men and women would coil up their hair and many hair-coiling styles were developed.|$|E
5|$|Growing {{and wearing}} long <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> common {{among women in}} the Western world until World War One. Long female hair never ceased in western culture, though it was rare during the 1920s and 1930s, and was {{frequent}} especially around 1970 and 1985.|$|E
5|$|In the European middle ages, shorter hair often {{signified}} servitude and peasantry, while long <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> often {{attributed to}} freemen, {{as was the}} case with the Germanic Goths and Merovingians.|$|E
50|$|Vellus <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> {{most easily}} {{observed}} {{on children and}} adult women, as it generally has less terminal hair to obscure it. Vellus <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> not lanugo <b>hair.</b> Lanugo <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> a much thicker type of hair that normally grows only on fetuses.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hair</b> <b>is</b> {{a protein}} {{filament}} that grows from follicles {{found in the}} dermis, or skin. <b>Hair</b> <b>is</b> one of the defining characteristics of mammals.The human body, apart from areas of glabrous skin, is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair. Most common interest in <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> focused on <b>hair</b> growth, hair types and hair care, but <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> also an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably alpha-keratin.|$|R
5|$|Anthropologists {{speculate}} that the functional significance of long head <b>hair</b> may <b>be</b> adornment, a by-product of secondary natural selection once other androgenic/somatic hair (body <b>hair)</b> had largely <b>been</b> lost. Another possibility is that long head <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> a result of Fisherian runaway sexual selection, where long lustrous <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> a visible marker for a healthy individual. For some groups or individuals, however, short <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> the selected trait.|$|R
5|$|Marge {{appeared}} in a 2005 advertisement for Dove Styling, where her normal beehive <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> exchanged for a more stylish look {{for a series of}} ads featuring several popular cartoon women.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} imagined Darcy to be dark despite no such {{references in}} the novel and asked Firth to dye black his light-brown hair, eyebrows and lashes; they instructed all male actors to let their hair grow before filming and shave off their moustaches. Three brunette wigs were made to cover Ehle's short, blonde hair and one wig for Alison Steadman (Mrs. Bennet) because of her thick, heavy hair. Susannah Harker's (Jane) <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> slightly lightened to contrast with Elizabeth's and was arranged in a classic Greek style to highlight the character's beauty. Mary's plainness was achieved by painting spots on Lucy Briers's face; her <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> greased to suggest an unwashed appearance and was arranged to emphasise the actress's protruding ears. As Kitty and Lydia were too young and wild to have their hair done by the maids, the actresses' <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> not changed much. Makeup artist Caroline Noble had always considered Mr. Collins a sweaty character with a moist upper lip; she also greased David Bamber's hair {{and gave him a}} low parting to suggest baldness.|$|E
5|$|In West African cultures, {{women with}} long hair were highly valued. Long, thick <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> seen {{as a sign of}} health, strength, and {{capability}} to bear many children. In keeping with this general theme, women who were too young for marriage would shave a portion of their heads to signal so. This tradition, however, did not extend to every West African culture, as several valued shorter hair.|$|E
25|$|An {{individual}} <b>hair's</b> shape <b>is</b> {{never completely}} circular. The cross-section of a <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> an ellipse, which can tend towards a circle or be distinctly flattened. Asiatic heads of straight <b>hair</b> <b>are</b> formed from almost-round hairs, and Caucasian hair's cross sections form oval shapes. Afro-textured hair has a flattened cross-section and is finer, and its ringlets can form tight circles with diameters {{of only a}} few millimeters. In humans worldwide, Asiatic <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> the most common, whereas afro-textured <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> the least common. This is because the former <b>hair</b> texture <b>is</b> typical of the large populations inhabiting East Asia as well as the indigenous peoples of the Americas.|$|R
50|$|Among rabbits, each guard <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> {{surrounded}} {{by a number of}} awn hairs. The awn <b>hairs</b> <b>are</b> slightly shorter, and have a flat (rather than pointed) tip. They also are slightly wavy and have a thinner cortex. Clustered around each awn <b>hair</b> <b>are</b> two more <b>hair</b> types, the awn wool and underwool.|$|R
50|$|Cutting <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> often {{done with}} hair clipper, {{scissors}} and razors. Combs and <b>hair</b> grips <b>are</b> often employed to isolate {{a section of}} <b>hair</b> which <b>is</b> then trimmed.|$|R
5|$|The biblical account {{states that}} Samson was a Nazirite, {{and that he}} was given immense {{strength}} to aid him against his enemies and allow him to perform superhuman feats, including slaying a lion with his bare hands and massacring an entire army of Philistines using only the jawbone of an ass. However, if Samson's long <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> cut, then his Nazirite vow would be violated, and he would lose his strength.|$|E
5|$|Commercial artist Russell H. Tandy was {{the first}} artist to {{illustrate}} Nancy Drew. Tandy was a fashion artist and infused Nancy with a contemporary fashion sensibility: her early style {{is that of a}} flatfoot flapper: heeled Mary Janes accompany her blue flapper skirt suit and cloche hat on three of the first four volume dust jackets. As styles changed over the next few years, Nancy began to appear in glamorous frocks, with immaculately set hair, pearls, matching hats, gloves, and handbags. By the 1940s, Nancy wore simpler, tailored suits and outfits; her <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> often arranged in a pompadour. In the post-war era, Tandy's Nancy is shown hatless, wearing casual skirt and blouse ensembles, and carrying a purse, like most teens of the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|In Southeast Asia and Indonesia, male long <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> {{valued in}} until the seventeenth century, when the area adopted outside {{influences}} including Islam and Christianity. Invading cultures enforced shorter hairstyles on men {{as a sign}} of servitude, as well. They were also confused at the short hairstyles among women in certain areas, such as Thailand, and struggled to explain why women in the area had such short hair. They came up with several mythical stories, one of which involved a king who found a long hair in his rice and, in a rage, demanded that all women keep their hair short.|$|E
50|$|Once the <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> cut, wet {{the hair}} {{by taking a}} shower. Then take a towel and dry the hair by rubbing the towel vigorously until the <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> mostly dry (it should still be {{somewhat}} wet) and stands up. Put a hat on forwards (backwards does not usually work as well) and blow dry the hair until the <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> flipped up as desired. To maintain it, hairspray may be used, although if the <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> short enough, it {{should be able to}} stay flipped up by itself.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hair</b> color <b>is</b> the {{pigmentation}} of hair follicles due to {{two types}} of melanin: eumelanin and pheomelanin. Generally, if more eumelanin is present, {{the color of the}} <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> darker; if less eumelanin <b>is</b> present, the <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> lighter. The darker a person's natural <b>hair</b> color <b>is,</b> the more individual hair follicles they have on their scalp. Levels of melanin can vary over time causing a person's hair color to change, and it is possible to have hair follicles of more than one color on the same person. Particular <b>hair</b> colors <b>are</b> associated with ethnic groups. Gray or white <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> associated with age.|$|R

5|$|In the Muslim world, {{it seems}} the trend of hair styles is now favouring short over long in men. In the past, Bedouin Muslims often wore their hair in long braids, but {{influences}} from the Western world have caused a change in attitudes. Bedouins are now {{less likely to have}} long hair. Islamic countries in North Africa such as Egypt view long hair in men as modernist and in one case the Egyptian police viewed it as Satanic and a sign of an infidel. Spanish rulers during the Medieval Period suspected long-haired males to be Moors or Moriscos, therefore long <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> forbidden since it was believed to be a Moorish custom. However, modern North African men have adopted Western short hair.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} Japan, heian gentleman {{were not very}} {{interested}} in a woman's physical beauty and rarely {{had an opportunity to}} see it. The only physical attribute of interest was a woman's hair, which had to be thick and longer than she was tall. The fascination with long <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> one reason why a woman's becoming a nun was regarded with such seriousness— it could never again grow to its full length. This explains why Genji refuses to let Murasaki (his de facto wife in the classical Japanese novel The Tale of Genji) take the tonsure when she is ill.|$|E
5|$|Newton died in {{his sleep}} in London on 20 March 1727 (OS 20 March 1726; NS 31 March 1727) and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Voltaire may have been present at his funeral. A bachelor, he had {{divested}} much of his estate to relatives during his last years, and died intestate. His papers went to John Conduitt and Catherine Barton. After his death, Newton's <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> examined and found to contain mercury, probably resulting from his alchemical pursuits. Mercury poisoning could explain Newton's eccentricity in late life.|$|E
5000|$|Awn <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> {{also known}} as grannenhaare. Awn <b>hairs</b> <b>are</b> {{distally}} thicker in comparison to down hair and have {{a shift in the}} shape towards the top of the <b>hair.</b> There <b>is</b> another version of awn hair, known as grannenflaumhaare or down awn <b>hair,</b> which <b>is</b> thin and crimped on the proximal end of the hair, while still containing a thickened dorsal end.|$|R
50|$|Chestnut <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> a <b>hair</b> color which <b>is</b> {{a reddish}} shade of brown hair. In {{contrast}} to auburn hair, the reddish shade of chestnut <b>is</b> darker. Chestnut <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> common among the native peoples of Northern, Central, Western, and Eastern Europe.|$|R
40|$|Two {{adolescent}} girls having premature greying of <b>hairs</b> <b>were</b> treated with 200 mg calcium pantothenate daily orally. In a follow up of 29 and 13 months respectively, 757 and 1069 grey <b>hairs</b> <b>were</b> counted to have got converted into black <b>hairs.</b> It <b>is</b> suggested that greying of <b>hairs</b> <b>is</b> reversible {{at least in}} some cases; further studies are, therefore, very much indicated. A method has also been described to assess the effect of a remedy for grey hairs...|$|R
5|$|Pliny the Elder in his Natural History and Varro related {{that the}} Romans {{did not begin}} to cut their hair short until barbers were {{introduced}} to Italy from Sicily by P. Ticinius Mena in 299 BC. Women in Roman times valued long hair, usually with a center part. Apart from in the earliest times, men's <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> usually shorter than women's, although other cultures of the time, such as Greeks in the east, considered long hair to be typical of philosophers, who {{were thought to be}} too engrossed in learning to bother with hair. Strictly in the province of Rome, however, the shorter hairstyle was especially popular. When Julius Caesar conquered the Gauls, who favored long hair, he ordered it to be cut short.|$|E
5|$|Prior to full production, {{the team}} created a tech demo in 2012 {{to test the}} {{creation}} and movement of highly detailed models and environments. This tech demo was titled Agni's Philosophy, which also acted as a test demo for the Luminous Studio engine which {{would be used for}} Final Fantasy XV. Character designs and modelling was overseen by Business Division 2; the team was led by Kazuaki Iwasawa, the character model supervisor. The character Crowe's <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> based on the hairstyle for the main female protagonist of Agni's Philosophy. The hairstyles for both Crowe and Lunafreya were first modelled using a real mannequin wig to ensure they could be managed. Their fully rendered wigs were composed of three thousand curves each, a thousand more than originally estimated.|$|E
5|$|Tapping felt {{acting on}} the new show went a little easier when filming Carter scenes with Bill Dow ("Bill Lee"), {{with whom she had}} {{previously}} worked on Stargate SG-1. She said another factor that made acting on Atlantis easier was the welcoming cast and crew of the series. Tapping's <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> longer than it was during her time on SG-1, and the military approved of the change {{as long as it was}} worn up. To save money on visual effects, the crew built set pieces to represent some of the buildings on M7R-227 and placed them in front of the puddle jumper set. Another measure taken as a substitute to visual effects was to cast mime artists as the frozen Asurans.|$|E
50|$|The {{selling of}} human hair for weaves, wigs, and other <b>hair</b> styling {{products}} <b>is</b> an industry that generates {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars annually and is growing as a large export economy in some Asian regions, such as India, at a rate of 10-30 percent annually. In India, a large portion of the <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> sourced from Hindu temples where <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> donated for religious practices, particularly in honor of the Hindu God Vishnu. This <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> highly sought out for its 'virgin', untreated qualities, as well as its great length. From there the <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> cleaned and the color is removed before being re-dyed for international style tastes.|$|R
50|$|The {{most popular}} and {{commonly}} available form of <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> known as premium <b>hair.</b> It <b>is</b> sold in most beauty supply stores or online. The roots and tips of <b>hairs</b> <b>are</b> interwoven in premium hair which causes tangling. This {{is due to the}} opposing cuticle layers catching onto one another. However, as it is the most inexpensive type of <b>hair,</b> it <b>is</b> a best seller.|$|R

5|$|The first Giant Schnauzers {{emerged from}} Swabia in the German state of Bavaria, and Württemberg in the 17th century. These {{original}} Giant Schnauzers were considered a rough-coated {{version of the}} German pinscher breeds, and their <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> thought to help them withstand the harsh German winters and bites from vermin. The origins of the breed are unclear, but sources speculate it originated through some combination of black Great Danes, German Shepherds, Rottweilers, Dobermans, Boxers, Bouvier des Flandres, Thuringian Shepherds, and the Standard Schnauzer.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} modern {{studies that have}} {{supported}} the original autopsy finding. In a 2008 study, researchers analysed samples of Napoleon's hair from throughout his life, as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries. All samples had high levels of arsenic, approximately 100 {{times higher than the}} current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy, and the high arsenic concentration in his <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> not caused by intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives. Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning, and confirmed evidence of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer as the cause of death.|$|E
5|$|Turner was {{discovered}} in 1936 at the Top Hat Malt Shop in Hollywood, California. At the age of 16, she was signed to a personal contract by Warner Bros. director Mervyn LeRoy, who took her {{with him when he}} moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1938. Turner attracted attention in her first film, LeRoy's They Won't Forget (1937), and she later starred in featured roles, often as an ingenue. Her auburn <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> bleached blonde for a 1939 film at MGM, and she remained blonde {{for the rest of her}} life, except for a few film roles.|$|E
