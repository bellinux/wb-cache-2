5|$|Shortly afterwards, at 19:30, B Company {{detected}} a North Korean force of around company-size {{preparing for a}} frontal assault, and called-in mortar fire to break up their formations, while a number of forward patrols had to be withdrawn by the Australians {{in order to prevent}} their encirclement. In response the North Koreans fired mortars at the Australian positions with limited effect. Half an hour later North Korean shells hit the 3 RAR battalion headquarters and C Company positions {{on the other side of}} the river, however the rounds landed in the <b>damp</b> <b>soil</b> of the paddy field and failed to explode. Periodically they were also targeted by machine-gun fire, but it was mostly high and posed little threat. Perhaps also under the impression that the Australians had withdrawn, the North Koreans failed to press their attack. Yet they soon realised their mistake and heavy small arms fire began again at 22:30 with North Korean activity against A and B Companies increasing significantly, which resulted in B Company suffering two killed and three wounded. The Australian right flank was now exposed and following a request from Thirlwell, Chitts detached 1 Platoon under Lieutenant John Wathen to bolster B Company. At 23:00 further artillery and mortar fire missions were ordered by the Australians against the North Koreans in response to renewed concentrations in preparation for an assault. Around the same time 8 Platoon C Company under Lieutenant Colin Townsend was sent across the bridge in the darkness to further reinforce B Company, and they dug-in on each side of the road leading to the bridge. Telephone lines had been laid by the Australians to their forward companies, and despite the fighting they remained intact throughout the battle.|$|E

25|$|Crickets are {{a common}} subject of children's books on nature and advice on keeping pet crickets are plentiful. An ideal home habitat for a cricket is a large {{transparent}} jar or a small terrarium {{with at least two}} inches of <b>damp</b> <b>soil</b> on the bottom. There must be plenty of shelter where the crickets can hide; children's books and industrial breeders recommend egg-crate shells.

The city has 122 buildings listed as monuments historiques, the 19th-ranked French city. Most of the old buildings were made of tuffeau stone (a light, easily-sculpted sandstone typical of the Loire Valley) and cheaper schist. Because of its sturdiness, granite was often used for foundations. Old buildings on the former Feydeau Island and the neighbouring embankments often lean because they were built on <b>damp</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tāwari {{can often}} be found {{together}} with the New Zealand kauri Agathis australis in the understory of the lowland rain forest. It is common in cloud forest up to 700m too. The species has a preference for shaded or sheltered locations, often in permanently <b>damp</b> <b>soil</b> and near streams. It is locally abundant but mostly individuals are far between. It is common in regenerating forests along with tawheowheo Quintinia serrata. Pollination is mainly by birds. The seeds are partly covered by a fleshy aril and are dispersed by birds and other animals that eat it. The wide spreading anthers are an adaptation to pollination by birds.|$|E
25|$|The plow {{is a tool}} used {{in farming}} for initial {{cultivation}} of soil in preparation for sowing seed or planting. It has been a basic instrument for most of recorded history, and {{represents one of the}} major advances in agriculture. In modern use, a plowed field is typically left to dry out, and is harrowed before planting. An American agricultural pioneer named John Deere modernized the plow by shaping steel from an old sawmill blade and joining it to a wrought iron moldboard. Deere polished both parts smooth so the <b>damp</b> <b>soil</b> would no longer stick. After patenting the device in 1837, it became an instant success and a necessity on American farms.|$|E
50|$|It can {{be grown}} in normal garden conditions.They prefer neutral or {{slightly}} acidic, (or lime-free), well drained, and fertile (or humus rich) soils. They can tolerate dry soils, or clay and heavy soils, but it prefers <b>damp</b> <b>soils.</b>|$|R

25|$|Blow flies – Family Calliphoridae- Flies in {{this family}} are often {{metallic}} in appearance and between 10 and 14mm in length. In addition to the name blow-fly, some members of this family are known as blue bottle fly, cluster fly, greenbottles, or black blowfly. A characteristic of the blow-fly is its 3-segmented antennae. Hatching from an egg to the first larval stage takes from eight hours to one day. Larvae have three stages of development (called instars); each stage is separated by a molting event. Worldwide, there are 1100 known species of blowflies, with 228 species in the Neotropics, {{and a large number}} of species in Africa and Southern Europe. The most common area to find Calliphoridae species are in the countries of India, Japan, Central America, and in the southern United States. The typical habitat for blow-flies are temperate to tropical areas that provide a layer of loose, <b>damp</b> <b>soil</b> and litter where larvae may thrive and pupate. The forensic importance of this fly is that it is the first insect to come in contact with carrion because they have the ability to smell death from up to ten miles (16km) away.|$|E
500|$|The nest is an untidy {{globular}} structure, {{on which}} the roof tapers {{to a point that}} has an opening into the interior chamber. The nest is [...] in diameter while the interior chamber is [...] across. To start constructing the nest, a single twig is inserted into the top of an acacia tree [...] above the ground. This leads to the paired bushcrows becoming excited, engorging their blue facial skin. Almost ritualistically the pair then pick the acacia's leaves and twigs, dropping them to the ground. The pair end this display by chasing each other through the trees before continuing construction. The nest is made out of thorny twigs while the interior chamber is lined with dry grass and dried cattle dung. <b>Damp</b> <b>soil</b> is used to keep the initial twigs connected. Old nests are repaired and reused.|$|E
500|$|A {{saprobic}} species, {{it grows}} generally in subalpine regions, fruiting on rotten wood and <b>damp</b> <b>soil,</b> {{and can also}} sometimes be found on ashes, wet leaves or bracket fungi. In Alaska {{it has been found}} growing on humus in the tundra. A six-year study of the succession of fungal flora appearing on freshly cut stumps of Poplar trees (Populus canadensis) showed that S.scutellata appeared roughly {{in the middle of the}} fungal succession (about 24 years after the tree had been cut), along with the species Ascocoryne sarcoides, Scutellinia cervorum, and Lasiosphaeria spermoides. When growing on wood, it is often obscured by surrounding moss. Though sometimes found alone, they typically fruit in groups, sometimes forming dense clusters on rotting wood or other plant detritus. Due to its small size, it is often overlooked, but mycologist Vera Evenson has observed that [...] "the discovery of the Eyelash Cup is always a great pleasure", due to [...] "the beauty of the eyelashes". Vera McKnight describes it as [...] "a most attractive little fungus", and claims it is easy to notice due to its bright colouration.|$|E

50|$|It {{prefers a}} well {{draining}} soil, and will appreciate a sunny position, {{but will also}} thrive in a sheltered or shaded location. While it can survive in dry soils, it prefers moist or <b>damp</b> <b>soils,</b> likened to that of its natural habitat. It can tolerate heavy pruning.|$|R
50|$|Silaum silaus {{grows in}} a wide variety of habitats, {{generally}} preferring those with <b>damper</b> <b>soils.</b> Specifically, S. silaus can be found in unimproved neutral grassland, railway and road verges and meadows (hay, water and lowland meadows); it is also occasionally found on chalk downs and vegetated shingle.|$|R
500|$|The spadefoot toads of North America {{are also}} adapted to {{underground}} life. The Plains spadefoot toad (Spea bombifrons) is typical {{and has a}} flap of keratinised bone attached {{to one of the}} metatarsals of the hind feet which it uses to dig itself backwards into the ground. As it digs, the toad wriggles its hips from side to side to sink into the loose soil. It has a shallow burrow in the summer from which it emerges at night to forage. In winter, it digs much deeper and has been recorded at a depth of [...] [...] The tunnel is filled with soil and the toad hibernates in a small chamber at the end. During this time, urea accumulates in its tissues and water is drawn in from the surrounding <b>damp</b> <b>soil</b> by osmosis to supply the toad's needs. Spadefoot toads are [...] "explosive breeders", all emerging from their burrows {{at the same time and}} converging on temporary pools, attracted to one of these by the calling of the first male to find a suitable breeding location.|$|E
500|$|The order Gymnophiona (from the Greek gymnos meaning [...] "naked" [...] and ophis meaning [...] "serpent") or Apoda (from the Latin an- meaning [...] "without" [...] and the Greek poda meaning [...] "legs") {{comprises}} the caecilians. These are long, cylindrical, limbless animals with a snake- or worm-like form. The adults vary in length from 8 to 75 centimetres (3 to 30 inches) {{with the exception}} of Thomson's caecilian (Caecilia thompsoni), which can reach [...] A caecilian's skin has a large number of transverse folds and in some species contains tiny embedded dermal scales. It has rudimentary eyes covered in skin, which are probably limited to discerning differences in light intensity. It also has a pair of short tentacles near the eye that can be extended and which have tactile and olfactory functions. Most caecilians live underground in burrows in <b>damp</b> <b>soil,</b> in rotten wood and under plant debris, but some are aquatic. Most species lay their eggs underground and when the larvae hatch, they make their way to adjacent bodies of water. Others brood their eggs and the larvae undergo metamorphosis before the eggs hatch. A few species give birth to live young, nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the oviduct. Caecilians have a mostly Gondwanan distribution, being found in tropical regions of Africa, Asia and Central and South America.|$|E

2500|$|Some older {{low-cost}} {{structures are}} elevated on tapered concrete pylons set into shallow pits, a method frequently used to attach outdoor decks to existing buildings. This {{is seen in}} conditions of <b>damp</b> <b>soil,</b> [...] especially in tropical conditions, as it leaves a dry ventilated space under the house, and in far northern conditions of permafrost (frozen mud) as it keeps the building's warmth from destabilizing the ground beneath. During an earthquake, the pylons may tip, spilling the building to the ground. This can be overcome by using deep-bored holes to contain cast-in-place reinforced pylons, which are then secured to the floor panel {{at the corners of}} the building. Another technique is to add sufficient diagonal bracing or sections of concrete shear wall between pylons.|$|E
2500|$|Frame {{structures}} were built on piers {{to keep the}} air circulating across the area's <b>damp</b> <b>soil,</b> while brick structures had a root cellar with a drainage tunnel. Inside, Harmonists built fireplaces {{to the left or}} right of center to allow for a long center beam, adding strength to support the structure and its heavy, shingled roof. [...] "Dutch biscuits" [...] (wood laths wrapped in straw and mud) provided insulation and soundproofing between the ceiling and floors. The exterior was insulated with bricks between the exterior's unpainted weatherboards and the interior's lath and plaster walls. Structures had standard parts and pre-cut, pre-measured timbers, which were assembled on the ground, adjusted to fit on site, raised in place, and locked into place with pegs and mortise and tenon joints. Two-story floor plans for homes included a large living room, kitchen, and entrance hall, with stairs to the second floor and attic. In Indiana, Harmonists did their baking in communal ovens, so stoves could be substituted for fireplaces.|$|E
