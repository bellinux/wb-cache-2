40|$|Current and {{potential}} shortfalls {{in the number}} of radiation scientists stand {{in sharp contrast to the}} emerging scientific opportunities and the need for new knowledge to address issues of cancer survivorship and radiological and nuclear terrorism. In response to these challenges, workshops organized by the Radiation Research Program (RRP), National Cancer Institute (NCI) (Radiat. Res. 157, 204 - 223, 2002; Radiat. Res. 159, 812 - 834, 2003), and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (Nature, 421, 787, 2003) have engaged experts from a range of federal agencies, academia and industry. This workshop, Education and Training for Radiation Scientists, addressed the need to establish a sustainable pool of expertise and talent for a wide range of activities and careers related to radiation biology, oncology and epidemiology. Although fundamental radiation chemistry and physics are also critical to radiation sciences, this workshop did not address workforce needs in these areas. The recommendations include: (1) Establish a National Council of Radiation Sciences to develop a strategy for increasing the number of radiation scientists. The strategy includes NIH training grants, interagency <b>cooperation,</b> <b>interinstitutional</b> collaboration among universities, and active involvement of all stakeholders. (2) Create new and expanded training programs with sustained funding. These may take the form of regional Centers of Excellence for Radiation Sciences. (3) Continue and broaden educational efforts of the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO), the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), and the Radiation Research Society (RRS). (4) Foster education and training in the radiation sciences for the range of career opportunities including radiation oncology, radiation biology, radiation epidemiology, radiation safety, health/government policy, and industrial research. (5) Educate other scientists and the general public on the quantitative, basic, molecular, translational and applied aspects of radiation sciences...|$|R

Restraint and examination of land consumption are overriding goals which have to be shared at all levels of urban and territorial planning in the context of policies of subsidiarity and <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The intrinsic relationships between the zoning and physical structure of urban environments suggest that the mechanisms through which planners can evaluate the environmental consequences of existing zoning ordinances and improve the scientific basis of future decision making in order to mitigate the negative effects of urban development should be in place [2].

40|$|Brazilian {{agriculture}} develops between extremes: on one side, systems {{portrayed as}} of high productivity and efficiency and, on the other, traditional systems of subsistence, often stigmatized as inefficient and environmentally degrading. In {{this article we}} present {{a discussion of the}} revaluation of the traditional production system called slash-and-burn, within the municipality of Biguaçu, Santa Catarina. We also discuss the strategies of access to different markets that have taken place due to the innovation and collective organization of farmers. This transformation originated from the knowledge of the real concerns and wishes of farmers who practice the system. They, allied to the participatory planning process, resulted in organizational, product and management innovations. Through <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>cooperation,</b> there was a reinterpretation and valorization of the slash-and-burn, which is expressed by the environmental regularization of the system, in addition {{to the creation of a}} collective brand called "Valor da Roça". The use of the brand has helped in the reduction of informational asymmetry and has increased the farmers’ income.

40|$|Current {{changes in}} {{territorial}} organization are interpreted {{by focusing on}} two main aspects that are different yet closely interrelated.

The second aspect concerns the change in forms and procedures of collective action in urban and territorial policies, recognizing, in particular, the consolidation - including in practices - of forms of partnership, <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>cooperation,</b> strategic planning and governance. Within this general context, this article aims to present and discuss changes, both ongoing and recent, by (1) presenting the changes that are emerging in the framework of Italian urban and territorial policies; and (2) discussing critically, with reference to the Italian case, the relationship between change in the idea of local territories and change in urban and territorial policies.

It is suggested that 3 state policy encouraging successful <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>cooperation</b> must: avoid threatening the institutions, recognize that they must be the actual bargaining entities, inspire their interest through neutral mechanisms, educate leadership on what is possible and how to proceed, be almost universally supportive of ideas that reach maturity, and provide help to ensure thorough planning and legal completion. Models of cooperation that are drawn mainly from the private sector are briefly described: ad hoc agreements; consortia; affiliations; management contracts; program transfers: federations; holding companies; interlocking directorates; consolidations; acquisitions; reincorporations and dissolutions; and combinations, sequences, and sequels. Elements necessary to make ventures work are identified, including vision, commitment, and support. An example of cooperation between Philadelphia College of Art and Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts is included.

40|$|In the {{discussion}} that follows, Section I begins by exploring {{the genesis of}} linkage. Although its relative emphasis may be a recent development, linkage is not itself a new phenomenon, but a long-contemplated topic {{in the history of}} international trade. Section II surveys and categorizes the contemporary linkage debate from three aspects: motivation (why to link), desirability (whether to link), and issue areas (what to link). It then critiques the existing literature, arguing that representative works are either too hypothetical, unempirical, or narrowly focused on particular regulatory topics. Against the backdrop of this critique, Section III shifts the focus of the linkage debate to the tension between free trade and social regulation. Based on the view that this tension could, if left unaddressed, ultimately lead to an entropic disaster of either trade failure or regulatory failure, Section IV proposes a synergistic understanding of competing values that emphasizes, and is consistent with, the WTO 2 ̆ 7 s integrationist telos. Based on this synergistic vision, and within the bounds of institutional feasibility, Section IV explores a multifaceted list of options, the implications of which extend well beyond the narrow terrain of WTO activities. These options include jurisprudence, harmonization, surveillance, international standards and government networks, and <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>cooperation.</b> In a brief conclusion, I argue that the proper management of linkage will enhance the legitimacy of the global trading system as a whole...|$|E
40|$|CHANCESI N TECHNOLOGY and {{evolving}} {{trends in}} contemporary schol-arship are enhancing {{the role of}} the research library as the principal cus-todian of the written and printed artifacts that serve as primary sources for studying the literature and history of western Europe from the Middle Ages to the eighteenth century. In order to respond to an increasing desire of scholars to examine original source materials in their original state, the New-berry Library has pursued new avenues of <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>cooperation</b> in collection development. These new approaches include: 1. A unique pro-gram ofjoint acquisitions with five midwestern institutions of higher edu-cation, 2. The en bloc acquisition of rare book collections from religious colleges and seminaries, and 3. The acquisition of selected books, appro-priately deemed out of scope, from museums and historical sites open to the general public. Proceeding in this manner, the Newberry Library has since 1991 added eighteen medieval manuscripts and several thousand rare printed volumes, dating from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century, signifi-cantly augmenting the preexisting strengths of its holdings. I. At the turn of the twenty-first century, two trends in the world of research libraries seem clear, one ominous, one hopeful. The ominous trend is that the research library is increasingly becoming {{one of a series of}} redundant points of electronic access to the Internet rather than a unique repository of physical artifacts and their apposite reference tools. In a future world with-out books as tangible documents of the age, researchers shall likely lack the equivalent of the incunables and first editions that today serve to inspire scholars to appreciate the chronological development of European cultur...|$|E
40|$|Latin America is well {{endowed with}} natural resources, yet poverty is wide-spread, wealth is {{distributed}} unequally and natural resoruces in marginal areas are deteriorating. The region {{can be broken}} down into several sub-regions according to geographic and ethnic characteristics, relative level of human Development and/or political organization. These differences must be recognized if efforts to solve common problems are to be targeted effectively. In spite of the region's relative wealth, nutritional deficits, especially in the consumption of calories and animal protein, are widespread. Problems of poverty, environmental degradation and equity are most acute in the Andean ecoregion and the tropical forest margins, especially in the rural areas. Livestock {{play a critical role in}} providing both food and non-food products for an ever-increasing population, and in ensuring the livelihood of impoverished smallholder farmers. Development of the livestock sector could help improve the economic and nutritional status of the poorest sectors of the population and promote equity and environmental protection. Many policies applied in the past have worked against these Development goals. This chapter provides examples of international and national policies that have had negative effects on livestock and rural Development and suggests ways in which policies and institutional arrangements might be improved. Development problems will be solved only through the application of better policies, the use of appropriate technologies and <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Achieving this requires implementation of holistic and participatory approaches that link research and Development efforts. The aim of this chapter is to highlight some of the physical and socio-economic characteristics of the Latin American region; to discuss the economic, social and environmental importance of the livestock sector as a means of overcoming poverty, malnutrition and degradation of natural resources; to review ongoing economic and policy trends, how they affect the livestock sector and the implications for equity in access to resources, services and benefits; and to propose specific research and Development approaches to address some of the major economic, social and envrionmental challenges to livestock agriculture...|$|E
40|$|Although {{there is}} general {{agreement}} among conservation practitioners {{about the need for}} (1) social involvement on the part of scientists; (2) interdisciplinary approaches; (3) working on local, regional, and global levels; and (4) implementing international agreements on biodiversity and environmental protection, a major challenge we face in conservation today is how to integrate and implement these multiple dimensions. Few researchers have actually offered hands-on examples for showing in practical terms how such integration can be accomplished. To address this challenge we present an innovative case study: the Omora Ethnobotanical Park, a long-term biocultural conservation initiative at the southern extreme of the Americas. Located near Puerto Williams (55 º S), Cape Horn Archipelago region, Chile, the Omora Park is a public-private reserve that provides material and conceptual foundations for three complementary conservation actions: (1) interdisciplinary scientific research; (2) informal and formal education, i. e., school, university, and training courses; and (3) biocultural conservation. The latter entails an actual reserve that protects biodiversity and the water quality of Puerto Williams' watershed, as well as programs on Yahgan traditional ecological knowledge and interdisciplinary activities, such as "field environmental ethics" and ecotourism, carried out in the reserve. Being at the "end of the world," and within one of the most remote and pristine ecoregions on the planet, Omora Park offers a "bio-cultural treasure. " At the same time, its geographical and technological isolation presents a challenge for implementing and sustaining conservation actions. To achieve the general conservation goals, we have defined 10 principles that have guided the actions of Omora: (1) <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>cooperation,</b> (2) a participatory approach, (3) an interdisciplinary approach, (4) networking and international cooperation, (5) communication through the media, (6) identification of a flagship species, (7) outdoor formal and informal education, (8) economic sustainability and ecotourism, (9) administrative sustainability, and (10) research and conceptual sustainability for conservation. These principles have been effective for establishing the long-term Omora initiative, as well as involving multiple actors, disciplines, and scales. Upon these foundations, the Omora initiative has extended its local goals to the regional level through a successful 5 -yr process in cooperation with the Chilean government to create the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, designated by UNESCO in June 2005, with the goal of establishing a long-term institutional-political framework that promotes social well-being and biocultural conservation at the southernmost tip of the Americas...|$|E
