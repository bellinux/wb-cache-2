5|$|In 1964, VAT {{had started}} to seek a {{stronger}} partner when it negotiated with AB Scania-Vabis. The companies planned to use Scania engines in Vanaja vehicles but the plan proved too expensive for VAT. This may have led the major owners of VAT to start discussions about merging VAT and SAT. The chairman of VAT held regular meetings with the SAT manager Tor Nessling. In 1967, AB Scania-Vabis expressed its interest in VAT and German company Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG was interested in co-operation with, or acquisition of, VAT. Valmet is also rumoured to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> VAT {{but there is no}} evidence of concrete negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the ditch since the 19th century, {{but much of}} its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit {{excavated}} sections of the ditch in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, {{in an attempt to}} determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that the bank {{to the north of the}} ditch is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests that the purpose of the earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a boundary marker.|$|E

As was the custom in an era where political ambition was viewed with suspicion, Hancock did not campaign or even publicly express interest in the office; he instead made his wishes known indirectly. Like everyone else, Hancock knew that George Washington {{was going to be}} elected as the first president, but Hancock may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> being vice president, despite his poor health. Hancock received only four electoral votes in the election, however, none of them from his home state; the Massachusetts electors all voted for another Massachusetts native, John Adams, who received the second-highest number of electoral votes and thus became vice president. Although Hancock was disappointed with his performance in the election, he continued to be popular in Massachusetts.|$|E

To better understand the etiology of proteinuria, some scientists attempted to study the phenomenon in laboratory animals.

However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s that the major urinary proteins of mice and rats were first described in detail. It was found that the proteins are primarily made in the liver of males and secreted through the kidneys into the urine in large quantities (milligrams per day).|$|E

500|$|Perrault's son Pierre Darmancour {{was assumed}} to have been {{responsible}} for the authorship of Histoires with the evidence cited being the book's dedication to Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans, the youngest niece of Louis XIV, which was signed [...] "P.

Perrault senior, however, was known for some time to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> contes de veille or contes de ma mère l'oye, and in 1693 published a versification of [...] "Les Souhaits Ridicules" [...] and, in 1694, a tale with a Cinderella theme called [...] "Peau d'Ane". Further, a handwritten and illustrated manuscript of five of the tales (including Le Maistre Chat ou le Chat Botté) existed two years before the tale's 1697 Paris publication.

On 10 August 1175, along with many other Scottish-based magnates and prelates, Jocelin was at Henry's court giving his obedience to the king as stipulated in the treaty. Jocelin again appeared at King Henry's court in January 1176. This time church matters were on the agenda. When the Archbishop of York confronted Jocelin over the subordination of the bishopric of Glasgow to the archbishopric of York, Jocelin refused to acknowledge this part of the treaty, and presented him with the Papal Bull declaring Glasgow to be a [...] "special daughter".|$|E

500|$|Magnus {{may have}} {{intended}} to invade Ireland next, {{only to find}} he had overextended himself. He may have been approached by Gruffudd ap Cynan, King of Gwynedd, who had been driven to Ireland by the Norman earls Hugh of Montgomery and Hugh d'Avranches. With six ships (according to Orderic Vitalis), Magnus steered towards Anglesey in Gwynedd, Wales. Appearing off the coast at Puffin Island, he interrupted a Norman victory celebration after their defeat of the Gwynedd king—for the Welsh, [...] "so opportunely it was ascribed to divine providence" [...] according to historian Rosemary Power (although Magnus had not necessarily intended to side with them). In the ensuing battle (known as the Battle of Anglesey Sound, according to Power [...] "the most widely reported event {{in the history of}} Magnus"), Magnus shot Hugh of Montgomery dead with an arrow through his eye and defeated the Norman forces. The sources indicate that Magnus regretted killing Montgomery, suggesting that he may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> an alliance with the Normans. He abruptly returned to Mann with his men, leaving the Norman army weak and demoralized. After this battle, Anglesey was considered the southern border of Norway. Gruffudd ap Cynan soon returned to the island, awarding Magnus gifts and honour (which may indicate that Gwynedd had capitulated). The extension of Magnus' kingdom probably began to concern the English, who remembered the invasion of Magnus' grandfather Harald Hardrada in 1066, war with Danish king Sweyn Estridson in 1069–70 and the threat of invasion by Cnut IV in 1085.|$|E
500|$|Serious art critics {{had less}} emotional, but also mixed, {{opinions}} of the work. It was received less favourably by Józef Szujski and Stanisław Tarnowski, but praised by painters Henryk Siemiradzki and Artur Grottger. Comments of Wojciech Korneli Stattler are interpreted by different authors as either praise, or critique. In Paris, displayed at Exposition Universelle, 1867 the painting received a gold medal. While in Poland the painting's context and message was clearly understood, the work, displayed in Paris, proved to be too obscure for the audience there, with few understanding the complex, historical context; some French critics interpreted it as {{a painting of a}} gambling hall. It is said, however, to have been well understood by the Russian visitors to the French gallery, some of whom are said to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> acquiring the painting, which was commended by Poles as [...] "they bought the real ones, might as well buy the painted ones, too". Eventually, however, the painting was acquired by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria for 50,000 franks. It was shown at a gallery in Vienna, and eventually ended up at the Hofmuseum. Thanks to the efforts of minister Juliusz Twardowski it was purchased by the government of the Second Polish Republic in 1920. As part of the Wawel Royal Castle National Art Collection it has been on a public display in the Royal Castle in Warsaw since 1931, {{with the exception of the}} period of World War II, when it was briefly looted by the Nazis.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} {{appearance}} in over three months on 3 May 2009, Barton was sent off late in a 3–0 loss to Liverpool at Anfield for a sliding challenge on Xabi Alonso. The red card ruled Barton out of Newcastle's remaining three matches of the season, with the club in danger of relegation from the Premier League. Newcastle manager Alan Shearer raised doubts about Barton's future at the club, saying [...] "I {{think it would be}} wrong to discuss his future now, but I'm not very happy." [...] On 5 May, Newcastle United announced the suspension of Barton indefinitely, and Barton was told to stay away from the club. As a result, Barton's future at Newcastle United was put in doubt. The club suspension was widely reportedly to have resulted not directly from the red card, but from a dressing room confrontation with Shearer and assistant manager Iain Dowie following the match. Shearer said he made a mistake putting Barton back into the team, and that his tackle was [...] "a coward's tackle", to which Barton replied that he was [...] "the best player at the club", and Shearer had to play him. Shearer said that Barton was not, and that he was [...] "shit". Barton replied that Shearer was [...] "a shit manager with shit tactics". When Dowie intervened, Barton called him [...] "a prick". Barton was reportedly transfer listed, with former manager Sam Allardyce reported to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> taking Barton to Blackburn Rovers.
