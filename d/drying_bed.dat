To determine the long-term effect of <b>dry</b> <b>bed</b> training in a youth health care setting. Setting. Haarlemmermeer, the Netherlands. Design. Descriptive. Method. Parents of 36 children (mean age 9 year) subjected to <b>dry</b> <b>bed</b> training in 1987 - 1989, were asked in 1993 if their child had wet his or her bed in the past 4 weeks. The parents were instructed in the training in group sessions in the youth health care setting. Results. In 1993, that is 4 - 6 years after the training, 83 % slept dry. In the other 17 % the number of wet nights dropped from 6 times to twice a week. Conclusion. We can conclude that the long-term success rate of <b>dry</b> <b>bed</b> training is high. Group <b>dry</b> <b>bed</b> training is a suitable method for children with nocturnal enuresis from age 8 when other methods are unsuccessful. The training is feasible outside the hospital...|$|R

50|$|Water {{content of}} sludge {{may be reduced}} by centrifugation, filtration, and/or {{evaporation}} to reduce transportation costs of disposal, or to improve suitability for composting. Centrifugation may be a preliminary step to reduce sludge volume for subsequent filtration or evaporation. Filtration may occur through underdrains in a sand <b>drying</b> <b>bed</b> or as a separate mechanical process in a belt filter press. Filtrate and centrate are typically returned to the sewage treatment process. After dewatering sludge may be handled as a solid containing 50 to 75 percent water. Dewatered sludges with higher moisture content are usually handled as liquids.|$|E

Polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, kitchen waste, paper, textile, etc. were chosen to simulate the MSW. The effects of temperature, air staging, and moisture on the CO formation and emissions were analysed for both the grate <b>drying</b> <b>bed</b> combustion and the CFB combustion. In the grate <b>drying</b> <b>bed,</b> the low temperatures increased the carbon to CO conversion rate which also increased slightly with the moisture content. Industrial field tests in a commercial grate–CFB incinerator showed that the CO concentration at the grate <b>drying</b> <b>bed</b> exit was very high and decreased along furnace height. The carbon to CO conversion rates were 0 – 20 % for the grate <b>drying</b> <b>bed</b> which exceeded the range of 0. 8 – 16 % measured in a grate <b>drying</b> <b>bed</b> exit of the commercial grate–CFB incinerator tests. In the commercial grate–CFB incinerator tests, at excess air ratios ranging from 1. 5 – 2. 0 or more, the CO emissions decreased to a low and stable level, whose corresponding carbon to CO conversion rates were far lower than 0 – 10 %.

40|$|<b>Dry</b> river <b>beds</b> {{are common}} {{worldwide}} and are rapidly increasing in extent {{due to the}} effects of water management and prolonged drought periods due to climate change. While attention has been given to the responses of aquatic invertebrates to drying rivers, few studies exist on the terrestrial invertebrates colonizing <b>dry</b> river <b>beds.</b> <b>Dry</b> river <b>beds</b> are physically harsh and they often differ substantially in substrate, topography, microclimate and inundation frequency from adjacent riparian zones. Given these differences, we predicted that <b>dry</b> river <b>beds</b> provide a unique habitat for terrestrial invertebrates, and that their assemblage composition differs from that in adjacent riparian zones. <b>Dry</b> river <b>beds</b> and riparian zones in Australia and Italy were sampled for terrestrial invertebrates with pitfall traps. Sites differed in substrate type, climate and flow regime. <b>Dry</b> river <b>beds</b> contained diverse invertebrate assemblages and their composition was consistently different from adjacent riparian zones, irrespective of substrate, climate or hydrology. Although some taxa were shared between <b>dry</b> river <b>beds</b> and riparian zones, 66 of 320 taxa occurred only in <b>dry</b> river <b>beds.</b> Differences were due to species turnover, rather than shifts in abundance, indicating that <b>dry</b> river <b>bed</b> assemblages are not simply subsets of riparian assemblages. Some spatial patterns in invertebrate assemblages were associated with environmental variables (irrespective of habitat type), but these associations were statistically weak. We suggest that <b>dry</b> river <b>beds</b> are unique habitats in their own right. We discuss potential human stressors and management issues regarding <b>dry</b> river <b>beds</b> and provide recommendations for future research.

30|$|With {{respect to}} the effect of the {{transparent}} plastic-covered <b>drying</b> <b>bed,</b> total and faecal coliforms as well as the total bacterial count reduce as time progresses and as the biosolids become drier. The <b>drying</b> <b>bed</b> from which the sludge was obtained was exposed to sunlight or solar rays. The plastic sheet used to cover the experimental bed is not UV treated so that solar UV rays are allowed to be in contact with the biosolids. Ultraviolet radiation from the sun causes damage to the genetic structure of bacteria, viruses and other pathogens making them incapable of reproduction. However, Shanahan (2010) has reported that plastic blocks the shorter UV rays responsible for killing bacteria.|$|E

40|$|A field {{investigation}} characterizing contamination at the Rocky Flats Plant (Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site) near Golden, Colorado revealed unexpectedly high moisture contents in the {{unsaturated soil}} column (vadose zone) beneath {{several of the}} Plant`s Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) sludge <b>drying</b> <b>beds.</b> Because these beds were seldom in use, researchers had hypothesized that the water required to maintain the saturated conditions observed beneath several of the sludge <b>drying</b> <b>beds</b> was coming from sources other than the beds themselves. In an effort to substantiate this hypothesis, a one-dimensional physically-based unsaturated flow model was utilized to simulate the vertical movement of moisture from the sludge <b>drying</b> <b>beds</b> into the unsaturated soil column below. The model was run to simulate vertical flow {{over a two-year period}} and results indicated that no significant changes from initial conditions were apparent. This evidence supports the hypothesis that the high moisture contents found beneath the sludge <b>drying</b> <b>beds</b> are being fed by sources other than infiltration of sludge applied to the beds themselves.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the potential for}} conversion of Class B to Class A biosolids with respect to salmonellae and fecal coliforms during solar drying in concrete lined <b>drying</b> <b>beds.</b> Anaerobically (8 % solids) and aerobically (2 % solids) digested Class B biosolids were pumped into field-scale <b>drying</b> <b>beds,</b> and microbial populations and environmental conditions were monitored. Numbers of fecal coliforms and salmonellae decreased as temper-ature and rate of desiccation increased. After 3 to 4 weeks, Class A requirements were achieved in both biosolids for the pathogens and the indicators. However, following rainfall events, significant increase in numbers was observed for both fecal coliforms and salmonellae. In laboratory studies, regrowth of fecal coliforms was observed in both biosolids and biosolid-amended soil, but the regrowth of salmonellae observed in the concrete-lined <b>drying</b> <b>beds</b> did not occur. These laboratory studies demonstrated that pathogens decreased in numbers when soil was amended with biosolids. Based on serotyping, the increased numbers of salmonellae seen in the concrete lined <b>drying</b> <b>beds</b> following rainfall events was most likely due to recoloni-zation due to contamination from fecal matter introduced by animals and not from regrowth of salmonella...|$|R

Excess sludge treatment and disposal {{has become an}} important part of the sewage treatment. Sludge itself is rich in essential nutrients of plant growth such as nitrogen and phos-phorus, so it’s a good organic fertilizer; but it often also contains harmful substances such as heavy metals.
