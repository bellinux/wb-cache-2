5|$|Co-evolution {{hypothesis}} : This is {{also called}} the virus-first hypothesis and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid {{at the same time}} as cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years. Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat. However, they have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents. Viroids are important pathogens of plants. They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication. The hepatitis delta virus of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from hepatitis B virus and cannot produce one of its own. It is, therefore, a <b>defective</b> <b>virus.</b> Although hepatitis delta virus genome may replicate independently once inside a host cell, it requires the help of hepatitis B virus to provide a protein coat so that it can be transmitted to new cells. In similar manner, the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus, which infects the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii. These viruses, which are dependent on the presence of other virus species in the host cell, are called satellites and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses.|$|E

50|$|A-MuLV {{causes a}} rapidly {{progressive}} lymphosarcoma known as Abelson disease in mice, {{which is a}} type of leukemia that does not involve the thymus. However, this is only possible when the host cell is co-infected with a helper virus which provides functions it {{needs to be able to}} replicate which it does not code for in its own genome such as a reverse transcriptase and some major structural proteins. As such, A-MuLV can be described as a dependovirus. A highly efficient helper virus commonly used when growing A-MuLV in vitro is Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV). It causes leukemia directly by interfering with the normal growth and differentiation processes of lymphocytes. It can infect B-cells which was shown by the fact that some tumor cells can be seen to have immunoglobulins (Ig) on their surface although most tumor cells do not have characteristic receptors on their surface indicating that they are undifferentiated cells. In vitro studies have shown that lymphocyte infection produces tumor cell populations comprising three types of cells: stable productive cells, non-productive cells and cells which produced <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> particles which are not infective.|$|E

Although Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated {{herpesvirus}} (KSHV) is etiologically associated with Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), defective KSHV {{has not been}} reported. Using differential genetic screening methods, we show that defective KSHV is present in KS tumors and PEL cell lines. To investigate the role of <b>defective</b> <b>viruses</b> in KSHV-induced pathogenesis, we isolated and characterized a lytic replication-defective KSHV, KV- 1, contain-ing an 82 -kb genomic deletion of solely lytic genes. Cells harboring KV- 1 escaped G 0 /G 1 apoptosis induced by spontaneous lytic replication occurred in cells infected with regular KSHV but maintained efficient latent replication. Consequently, KV- 1 -infected cells had phenotypes of enhanced cell proliferation and transforma-tion potentials. Importantly, KV- 1 was packaged as infectious virions by using regular KSHV as helpers, and KV- 1 -like variants were detected in cultures of two of five KSHV cell lines and 1 of 18 KS tumors. These results point to a potential role for <b>defective</b> <b>viruses</b> in the regulation of KSHV infection and malignant transformation.

To recover viable <b>defective</b> <b>viruses,</b> rVHSV-Delta N-Red and rVHSV-Delta P-Green, fish cells were co-transfected with both deleted cDNA VHSV genomes, together with plasmids expressing N, P and L of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.

Infected cells were always red and green with the very rare event of single red or green cell foci appearing. To clarify {{our understanding of how}} such <b>defective</b> <b>viruses</b> could be so efficiently propagated, we investigated whether (i) a recombination event between both defective genomes had occurred, (ii) whether both genomes were co-encapsidated in a single viral particle, and (iii) whether both <b>defective</b> <b>viruses</b> were always replicated together through a complementation phenomenon or even as conglomerate. To address these hypotheses, genome and viral particles have been fully characterized and, thus, allowing us to conclude that rVHSV-Delta N-Red and rVHSV-Delta P-Green are independent viral particles which could propagate only by simultaneously infecting the same cells...|$|R
40|$|Replication-defective vaccine vectors {{based on}} {{vesicular}} stomatitis virus (VSV) lacking its envelope glycoprotein gene (G) are highly effective in animal models. However, such ΔG vectors {{are difficult to}} grow because they require complementation with the VSV G protein. In addition, the complementing G protein induces neutralizing antibodies in animals and thus limits multiple vector applications. In the process of generating an experimental Nipah virus (a paramyxovirus) vaccine, we generated two defective VSVΔG vectors, each expressing {{one of the two}} Nipah virus (NiV) glycoproteins (G and F) that are both required for virus entry to host cells. These replication-defective VSV vectors were effective at generating NiV neutralizing antibody in mice. Most interestingly, we found that these two <b>defective</b> <b>viruses</b> could be grown together and passaged in tissue culture cells in the absence of VSV G complementation. This mixture of complementing <b>defective</b> <b>viruses</b> was also highly effective at generating NiV neutralizing antibody in animals. This novel approach to growing and producing a vaccine from two <b>defective</b> <b>viruses</b> could be generally applicable to vaccine production for other paramyxoviruses or for other viruses where the expression of at least two different proteins is required for viral entry. Such an approach minimizes biosafety concerns that could apply to single, replication-competent VSV recombinants expressing all proteins required for infection...|$|R

40|$|Murine {{acquired}} immune deficiency syndrome (MAIDS) shares several common characteristics {{with human}} AIDS, including immunodeficiency, hypergammaglobulinemia, susceptibility to infection, both B and T cell dysfunctions, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and aberrant cytokine production. The etiologic agent of MAIDS {{has been identified}} as a defective retrovirus which contains major deletions in its pol and env regions but has largely maintained its gag region. The only gene product of this virus is a 60 kDa gag fusion protein, Pr 60 gag, which is necessary and sufficient to induce MAIDS in susceptible mouse strains. The target cells of the MAIDS <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> have been identified as belonging to the B cell lineage. Infection of these target cells with the MAIDS <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> leads to their proliferation, which is required for the full development of the disease. We undertook several approaches in order to more clearly understand the role of the MAIDS <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> target B cell population in the development of this disease. Studies using SCID, CD 4 knockout, and nude mutant mice revealed that a relatively mature B cell population is the target of the MAIDS <b>defective</b> <b>virus,</b> and that these cells can be infected in the absence of CD 4 + T cells. Our knowledge {{of the nature of the}} MAIDS <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> target B cells was furthered by the derivation of two independent MAIDS defective virus-infected B cell lines which have characteristics of both mature and immature B cells. These B cell lines were used to demonstrate an in vivo association between Pr 60 gag and c-Abl. Additional exploration of the Pr 60 gag-c-Abl interaction revealed that Pr 60 gag could induce a CD 8 + T cell-dependant rejection of v-Abl-transformed pre-B cell lines, and increase the tumor latency of mice inoculated with Pr 60 gag-expressing B 16 F 1 melanoma cells. Taken together, these results enhance our knowledge of the identity and role of the MAIDS <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> target cells in the pathogenesis of this disease and propose a possible mechanism by which Pr 60 gag activates the disease process. As well as inducing MAIDS, Pr 60 gag may also have potential positive use in cancer therapy...|$|E

As a vector for clinical use, we assessed the <b>defective</b> vaccinia <b>virus</b> system, in which deletion of an essential gene blocks viral replication, resulting in an infectious virus that does not multiply in the host. The vaccinia virus Lister/Elstree strain, used during worldwide smallpox eradication, {{was chosen as the}} parental virus. The immunogenicity and safety of the <b>defective</b> vaccinia <b>virus</b> Lister were evaluated without and with the inserted human p 53 gene as a model and compared to parallel constructs based on modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), the present “gold standard” of recombinant vaccinia viruses in clinical development.

We have investigated the in vivo synthesis of a spliced hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA. By using the polymerase chain reaction with different sets of primers on DNA purified from infected livers and the HepG 2 HBV cell line, we detected a subgenomic HBV DNA complementary to the spliced viral RNA. Its nucleotide sequence {{was found to be}} identical to that previously described for the spliced RNA. This HBV cDNA was clearly detected in both liver capsids and serum virions.

40|$|We {{describe}} the derivation {{of a novel}} T-cell-defective virus vector employing the human herpesvirus 7 (HHV- 7). The new vector, designated Tamplicon- 7, replicates in CD 4 + T cells. The system is composed of a helper virus and <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> genomes derived by the replication of the input Tamplicon vector. There are two cis-acting functions required for the replication and packaging of the <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> genomes {{in the presence of}} the helper virus: the viral DNA replication origin and the composite cleavage and packaging signal, which directs the cleavage and packaging of <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> genomes. Viral DNA replication is compatible with the rolling circle mechanism, producing large head-to-tail concatemers of the Tamplicon vector. Thus, {{in the presence of the}} helper virus, the replicated vectors are packaged and secreted into the medium. Furthermore, we have shown that the vector can be employed to express a foreign gene, encoding the green fluorescent protein, in the T cells infected with the HHV- 7 helper virus. We predict that the Tamplicon- 7 vector might be potentially useful for gene therapy of diseases affecting the human CD 4 + T cells, including autoimmune diseases, T-cell lymphomas, and AIDS...|$|E

In this study, defective-interfering particles of poliovirus, which contain deletions in the region encoding the capsid proteins, are shown to initiate translation of proteins in vitro at these same two sites. Both the standard virus and the defective-interfering virus RNA direct the synthesis of two polypeptides labeled with n-formyl-methionine (fmet) at their amino termini. The size of the smaller fmet polypeptide synthesized in vitro by the <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> appears identical in size {{to that of the}} standard virus.

Following enteric administration of live HSV, a Th 1 cytokine response was induced in the spleen, while both Th 1 and notable Th 2 cytokine production were detected at mucosal sites. Modulation of mucosal and systemic immune response was achieved when nonreplicating recombinant HSV viruses expressing cytokines were used.

Often, these in vitro systems utilize <b>defective</b> <b>viruses.</b> <b>Defective</b> <b>viruses</b> allow for synchronized infections and circumvent the use of antiretrovirals. In addition, replication-defective viruses cause minimal cytopathicity because they fail to spread and usually do not encode env or accessory genes. On the other hand, replication-competent viruses encode all or most viral genes and better recapitulate the nuances of the viral replication cycle. The study of latency with replication-competent viruses requires the use of antiretroviral drugs in culture, and this mirrors the use of antiretroviral treatment (ART) in vivo. We describe a model that utilizes cultured central memory CD 4 + T cells and replication-competent HIV- 1. This method generates latently infected cells that can be reactivated using latency reversing agents in the presence of antiretroviral drugs.

Defective POLI- 220 and POLI- 317 RNAs were detected readily in infected lung tissue by RTPCR, but these Vero cell preparations did not modulate disease. However, after a single passage in embryonated eggs, defective POLI- 220 and POLI- 317 viruses significantly delayed the onset of disease and death in WSN-infected mice, although did not affect final mortality. Direct PCR sequencing confirmed the identity of mouse-passaged defective RNAs and showed that none had undergone any sequence changes.

Virus isolated from chronically infected brains generally retained the genetic character (ts or wild type) of the inoculated virus, but two exceptions to this are described.

Thus, defective HSV- 1 (Justin) genomes contain, within their limited DNA sequences, a sufficient set of recognition sites required for HSV DNA replication and packaging. The arrangement of repeat units within the regenerated <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> genomes was consistent with their replication by a rolling circle mechanism in which a single repeat unit served as the circularized template. This replication occurred most actively late after infection and could be shown to be inhibited by low concentrations of phosphonoacetate known to inhibit the HSV-specified viral DNA polymerase selectively. The resultant concatemers were shown to be cleaved to Mr 100 X 10 (6) DNA molecules which were terminated at one end with the proper ac end sequence of the parental standard virus DNA...|$|E
40|$|Murine AIDS (MAIDS) is {{characterized}} by severe lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. The proliferation of the infected target B cells {{is also an important}} manifestation of the disease (M. Huang, C. Simard, D. G. Kay, and P. Jolicoeur, J. Virol. 65 : 6562 - 6571, 1991). The etiologic agent of MAIDS is a defective murine leukemia virus that is deleted of most of its pol and env genes and appears to encode a single protein, the Gag precursor Pr 60 gag protein. Pr 60 gag is myristylated and attached to the plasma membrane. To study the role myristylation on the function of Pr 60 gag, we have generated a myristylation-negative (Myr-) mutant of the MAIDS <b>defective</b> <b>virus.</b> We found that Myr- Pr 60 gag interacted less tightly with the plasma membrane. In addition, the Myr- MAIDS <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> mutant was unable to induce expansion of infected cells and was nonpathogenic. These results emphasize the essential role of Pr 60 gag in the disease process. Our data also suggest that Pr 60 gag, once recruited to the cell membrane through its myristylation, interacts with other membrane-bound effectors to send signals to induce proliferation of the infected cells and to initiate immune dysfunctions...|$|E
40|$|Measles virus (MV) {{infection}} of the human central nervous system (CNS) typically involves widespread {{infection of}} neurons. However, {{little is known about}} how they become infected, how <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> arises and accumulates, or how virus spreads among the cells of the CNS. In vitro studies of viral interactions with human neuronal cells may contribute to the resolution of such issues. In mixed cultures containing differentiated human neuronal (hNT 2) cells and neuroepithelial cells, immunofluorescence studies show that the neurons, unlike both their NT 2 progenitors and the neuroepithelial cells, are not initially susceptible to MV infection. This is possibly due to their lack of expression of CD 46, a known cell surface receptor for MV. Later in the course of infection, however, both MV proteins and genomic RNA become detectable in their processes, where they contact infected, fully permissive neuroepithelial cells. Such a mechanism of virus transfer may be involved in the initiation and spread of persistent MV infection in diseases such as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Furthermore, mutated <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> may readily accumulate and spread without the need, at any stage, for viral maturation and budding. Measles virus (MV) is the etiological agent of the rare neu-rological diseases subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and measles inclusion body encephalitis (4, 20). In neuro...|$|E

The host interferon (IFN) response represents one of the first barriers that influenza viruses must surmount in order to establish an infection. Many advances have been made in recent years in understanding the interactions between influenza viruses and the interferon system. In this review, we summarise recent work regarding activation of the type I IFN response by influenza viruses, including attempts to identify the viral RNA responsible for IFN induction, the stage of the virus life cycle at which it is generated and the role of <b>defective</b> <b>viruses</b> in this process.

40|$|Satellite phage P 4 has two known {{options for}} propagation. In its lytic cycle, its {{regulatory}} functions can act in trans {{to alter the}} actions of a helper virus (P 2), which then provides necessary gene products, including capsid proteins. P 4 also can be propagated {{in the absence of a}} helper as a prophage, with distinct sites for integration within the Escherichia coli chromosome. We determined that a single spontaneous mutation (vir 1) of phage P 4 allows a third mode of propagation: as a plasmid (along with continued integration into the host chromosome). Hence, the P 4 regulatory element is capable of (i) temperate; (ii) lytic, helper-dependent; and (iii) plasmid modes of development. These findings emphasize the close relationship between <b>defective</b> <b>viruses</b> and plasmids...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) displays both interstrain and intrastrain genetic variability. Virus populations with extensive microheterogeneity have {{been defined as}} swarms or quasispecies. Many of the genomes within HIV- 1 swarms appear to be defective {{in one or more}} genes required for viral replication. It is unclear to what extent <b>defective</b> <b>viruses</b> {{play a role in the}} process of HIV- 1 infection or in the pathogenesis of AIDS. We have isolated two biologically active HIV- 1 clones: LW 12. 3, which contains defects in the vif and vpr genes, and MN ST. 1, which has a defect in the vpu gene. LW 12. 3 is unable to replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The growth of MN-ST. 1 in SupT 1 cells is marked by a 3 -week lag in extracellular virus production and by the presence of unusually abundant viral buds. We demonstrate here that coinfection of PBMC with these two partially defective HIV- 1 clones extends the cellular host range of LW 12. 3, significantly increases the replication rate of both viral genomes, and eliminates the delay in production observed with the vpu-defective MN ST. 1. When the lesions in vpr and vif of LW 12. 3 are repaired, the resultant virus grows normally in PBMC. This is also the case when only vif is repaired, indicating that complementation of LW 12. 3 in PBMC by MN ST. 1 is mediated by vif in trans. The reciprocal complementation results in a dramatic increase of HIV- 1 virulence. This two-component model represents a simplified version of the in vivo situation and illustrates one way in which interaction of <b>defective</b> <b>viruses</b> could increase the spread of infection and progression of disease...|$|R
