40|$|A new four-bed {{unit was}} opened in Bristol, UK, in 2014, for people {{detained}} under section 136 of the Mental Health Act. Police bring individuals posing {{a risk to}} themselves or others to a Place of Safety (PoS) {{in order to receive}} a mental health assessment. Individuals may be held for up to 72 hours, but cannot receive treatment against their will, unless assessed as lacking the capacity to refuse treatment. Issues requiring medical input arose in {{more than a third of}} patients, yet there was little guidance for trainees around the PoS. We conducted a survey which confirmed that robust clinical guidance was needed for junior doctors around medical assistance in this unique environment. We identified specific concerns around patient safety in relation to alcohol withdrawal, uncertainties around legislation and lack of clarity of who to call out of hours. Trainees felt they were working outside of their expertise. We collaborated with a variety of professionals to produce clinical guidance in line with best evidence, and made this easily accessible. We also gained a consensus that more experienced core trainees (SHOs) in Psychiatry should be the first point of contact. We then conducted a survey in June 2015, and found that doctors covering the PoS now felt there was sufficient guidance on most clinical scenarios, 100 % consensus on who to contact and improved confidence in their ability to manage issues arising. In August 2015 we held an informal training session for the new <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> on the rota. A subsequent survey revealed similarly positive results. Through this project, we were able to identify defects in a system, provide needed guidance to enable safer and more equitable care to a vulnerable group, and foster closer collaboration between junior doctors and managers in the design and use of services...|$|E

30|$|Even though PSE {{was well}} {{established}} in Singapore by the 1960 s, {{it was not}} until 1969 when basic and systematic in-service training was provided for preschool teachers by public institutions (Sharpe 1998). In 1977, the responsibility of preschool teacher training was taken over by the nation’s teacher-training institution and was eventually complemented by other private training providers by the 1990 s. By 1998, there were three levels of nationally accredited training courses for both child care and kindergarten teachers which were the 120 -h basic course, 210 -h certificate in preschool teaching intermediate course, and 120 -h certificate in preschool management and administration advanced course (Sharpe 1998). Nevertheless, many preschool teachers remained untrained due to the limited yearly <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> by the training providers. To deal with the shortage of well-trained and qualified personnel in the preschool sector, a 3 -year full-time diploma course in ECE was first launched in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, a public post-secondary education institution, in 1999.|$|R

The MPH program is operated from two sites: the DCM at the College of Health Sciences, of University of Zimbabwe (UZ) and the Health Studies Office (HSO) in MOHCW. The HSO in the MOHCW oversees the operation of field training in collaboration with approved Field Supervisors at the training sites. MOHCW provides field training sites through its eight provincial medical directorates. In addition the health directorates of the major cities in the country are designated field training sites. Since 1993, the program has had 18 Cohorts trained of which three are part-time. The part-time program was initiated in 2008 with an <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> 10 <b>trainees.</b> Since 2003, the full time program has experienced an increase in intake with the highest intake recorded being 16 trainees in 2003.

The sample consisted of 65 Greek skiers, both experienced and inexperienced. Three groups <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> participated: 1) a group of students of Athens, elective skiing – 28 people, 2) a group of students of Athens, specialization skiing – 21 people, 3) group of experienced skiers - 16 people. The sample taking was based on the following criteria: a) the skiers had to be Greek, b) to be over 18 years old, c) the questionnaires had to be completed anonymously in their leisure time. The questionnaires were given to the participants, including the following subjects: frequency of daily dinners, daily <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> cereals – baked products, daily <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> dairy products, daily <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> animal protein, daily <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> seafood, daily <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> fatty food, daily <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> vegetables – juice – fruit and daily <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> sweets.

Presently, available data from national studies suggest that {{only a minority of}} women benefit from such an approach. Regional studies and single institution reports suggest that trainee involvement in these procedures vary widely. Competency in laparoscopic surgery for EP is a mandatory requirement for independent practice in the UK. In a recent survey <b>of</b> UK <b>trainees</b> <b>of</b> all grades in obstetrics and gynaecology, 53.4 % <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> reported that they were trained or being trained in such procedures. This study examines the perspectives <b>of</b> the <b>trainees.</b> We performed a national questionnaire survey of intermediate- and advanced-level trainees in the UK During a 12 -month period, 52 % <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> had performed at least one procedure independently; 80 % <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> performed most <b>of</b> the procedure on at least one occasion. The satisfaction with training was rated as 3 on a five-point Likert scale. Thirty percent <b>of</b> the <b>trainees</b> had access to a laparoscopy simulator.

A hierarchical nested research study design (N= 64) was used to investigate trainee characteristics and change processes across three BACP accredited counsellor training programmes. This study used quantitative and qualitative methods to conduct two related studies: ‘The Early Effects of Practitioner Training’ and ‘A Longitudinal Examination <b>of</b> <b>Trainee</b> Change’. The first was comprised of a cross sectional examination <b>of</b> <b>trainee</b> characteristics (n= 63) and two qualitative studies: The Beginning of Training Study and a single subject Case Study of Margaret. The second consisted of one quantitative and two qualitative studies, these were: a paired sample investigation of the impact of training on one student cohort (n= 20), the End of Training Qualitative Study <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> (n= 7), and an Assimilation Model Analysis of Mandy. The research was conducted from a critical realist perspective.

Dietary determinants <b>of</b> lignan <b>intake</b> and their urinary excretion were also determined. The mean <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> lignans was 1224 (SD 539) mg/d, of which lariciresinol and pinoresinol covered 78 %. Almost half (47 %) <b>of</b> the <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> lignans was explained by the <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> rye products, berries, coffee, tea and roots. The urinary excretion of plant lignans corresponded to 17 % and enterolignans to 92 % <b>of</b> the <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> lignans. The urinary excretion of plant lignans was explained 14 % by the <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> rye products and <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> coffee, and consequently 3 – 7 % by the <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> water-insoluble fibre. The urinary excretion of enterolactone was explained 11 % by the <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> vegetables and rye products, 14 % by the <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> water-soluble fibre and only 4 % by the <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> lariciresinol.
