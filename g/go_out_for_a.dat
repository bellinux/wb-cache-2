Ashley tells Mary Margaret that all she wants is to be with Sean. Mary Margaret understands since her own romantic arrangement is not ideal. Sean shows up on a break from work and proposes to Ashley; she accepts and they <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> drive. David shows up next to give Mary Margret her Valentine, but mistakenly gives her Kathryn's.

5|$|Prompt Payment and Stealing a Ride are two 1911 American silent short comedy films {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Prompt Payment focuses on a lawyer who evades his creditors, dons a disguise and plays against them {{in a game of}} poker. After winning a large sum of money from them, he excuses himself and returns to pay them with their own money. Stealing a Ride is listed as a comedy, but has a clear dramatic element. Susie and Johnnie are out sledding when Susie's parents are about to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sleigh drive. The children ask to come along, but are refused. The children hitch their sleds {{to the back of the}} sleigh and follow along, only to fall off and get lost in the woods. The parents later track them down and bring them home. Both films were released together on a single reel on January 27, 1911 and were met with praise by critics. Both films are presumed lost.|$|E

They run afoul of a con artist instead; Henry, correctly suspecting this man is up to no good, proclaims his own intention {{to break into the}} music business. When the con man repeats the same words to Henry that he said to the music teacher, he is exposed as a fraud; the teacher thanks Henry by giving Punky several free lessons.|$|E

25|$|JR {{goes through}} a brief time of having lost himself and again battling legal troubles. Months later, he is back on track with his life and has {{reconciled}} with Babe, though the two still do not continue their romance. On January 10, 2008, they <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> snowday with Little Adam and have fun building a snowman, throwing snowballs and enjoying each other's company. The two express that they like being a family, just them and Little Adam. When JR talks of being a better man, one that Babe can possibly like again, the two nearly kiss. Babe stops the intimate encounter before it can happen and reminds JR that when they become romantic with each other, it never lasts and ends in destruction. JR tells Babe that he loves her and asks her to give them another chance, but as friends first and see where it leads. Babe, hesitant at first, accepts his request.|$|E
500|$|Matthews later {{admitted}} {{that she was not}} a serious fan of the show, but that she only used the line because it adequately described the type of relationship she was singing about. In an interview with the Daily Record, she explained, [...] "I'm not a big fan of [...] but I got the line about things getting strange for Mulder and Scully from watching the odd episode". After questioning, she later said that she would [...] "prefer to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> night on the town with Gazza and Chris Evans than meet [...] stars Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny". Matthews also related that [...] "I'm sure loads of people bought the record by mistake, but who cares? They should be flattered we wrote a song about [...] anyway".|$|E

Being sensitive to how difficult it must be to manage the house and kids by herself, Jim does not tell her who the investor is during their phone conversations and pretends to be stressed over the meeting; Pam, in turn, affects to be having no problems so that she will not add to Jim's supposed stress. Back at the office, Pam apologizes to Meredith, and the two <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> beer.

500|$|The {{tour of the}} United States faced various troubles. Ament {{said that}} the band and its crew had to [...] " [...] shows from the ground up, a venue {{everywhere}} we went." [...] In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at San Francisco, California's Golden Gate Park in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering {{from the effects of}} food poisoning. Vedder left the hospital to play the show, however {{he was not able to}} finish and ended up performing just seven out of twenty-one songs with the band. Neil Young filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, [...] "That whole [...] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [...] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few songs." [...] Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States. Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, [...] "I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music." [...] Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, Rafter won the US Open, {{a tournament}} that many {{expected}} Sampras to win, having won in 1995 and 1996. The win catapulted Rafter to the year-end no. 2 rankings behind Sampras. Seven-time Grand Slam champion John McEnroe believed Rafter to be a [...] "one-slam wonder", {{since it was}} only his second career ATP title. Up to that point, Sampras was 5-1 against Rafter, and defeated Rafter three times in fall 1997 to solidify his No. 1 ATP ranking.
