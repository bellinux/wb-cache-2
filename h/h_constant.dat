40|$|Marine {{studies have}} shown viral lysis of {{microorganisms}} releases DOC. But is the same true for freshwater bacterioplankton {{and what is the}} fate of the released DOC? This paper describes the relationship between microbial production and viral abundance in a subtropical river, Australia. In a year study the heterotrophic bacterial production (4 to 7. 5 g C per square m per d) consumed more carbon per day than the daily primary production (1. 1 g C per square m per d). Hence the ecosystem was net heterotrophic. However, DOC concentration in the water column remained constant but the bacterial populations turned the DOC pool over every few days. Viral abundance (1 x 10 E 11 per L) remained 10 times that of the bacteria (0. 5 x 10 E 10 per L). High specific bacterial growth rates (0. 6 to 3. 5 per <b>h),</b> <b>constant</b> bacterial and viral abundances suggest that the viral lysis was "short circuiting" the microbial loop by recirculating bacterial DOC. On each pass of the loop more DOC was respired as CO 2 so DOC and bacterial biomass was not passed to higher trophic groups. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentNo Full Tex...|$|E

We are interested in studying the structure of the ring of algebraic integers in an algebraic number field. A number field is a finite extension of Q. We’ll assume that the number fields we consider are all subfields of C. Definition. Suppose that K and L are fields with K ⊆ L. Then K is a subfield of L and L is an extension field of K. We denote the dimension of L as a vector space over K by [L: K]. If [L: K] < ∞, we say L is a finite extension of K. Definition. Suppose that H is a field with K ⊆ H ⊆ L.

40|$|The {{properties}} of water {{can have a}} strong dependence on the confinement. Here, we consider a water monolayer nanoconfined between hydrophobic parallel walls under conditions that prevent its crystallization. We investigate, by simulations of a many-body coarse-grained water model, how the {{properties of}} the liquid are affected by the confinement. We show, by studying the response functions and the correlation length and by performing finite-size scaling of the appropriate order parameter, that at low temperature the monolayer undergoes a liquid-liquid phase transition ending in a critical point in the universality class of the two-dimensional (2 D) Ising model. Surprisingly, by reducing the linear size L of the walls, keeping the walls separation <b>h</b> <b>constant,</b> we find a 2 D- 3 D crossover for the universality class of the liquid-liquid critical point for L/h~ 50, i. e. for a monolayer thickness that is small compared to its extension.

The circadian rhythm in melatonin and its relationship to subjective alertness was investigated in pre- and postmenopausal women under constant routine conditions (controlled posture, dim lighting, calorie intake, temperature, and prolonged wakefulness). Eleven healthy pre-menopausal (42 +/- 4 yr) and 10 postmenopausal women (55 +/- 2 yr) participated in the study. Salivary melatonin samples and subjective measures of alertness and sleepiness were assessed hourly during the 22 <b>h</b> <b>constant</b> routine protocol.

Data were collected under two protocols: normal ambulatory conditions of activity and rest and during a 27 <b>h</b> <b>constant</b> routine (CR) procedure. Mood data were collected every 3 h during the wake span of the ambulatory protocol and hourly during the 27 h CR. In both protocols, rectal temperature data were continuously recorded. In the ambulatory protocol, activity data were also collected to enable estimation of the unmasked (purified) temperature rhythm. Participants were 14 healthy females aged 18 - 25 yr in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Under both protocols, PA exhibited significant 24 h temporal variation [CR: F(23, 161) = 2. 12; p 0. 01; ambulatory: F(5, 55) = 2. 44, p 0. 05] with a significant sinusoidal component [CR: F(2, 21) 7. 51, p 0. 01; ambulatory: F(2, 3) = 20. 49, p. 05] of the same form as the circadian temperature rhythm. In contrast, NA exhibited an increasing linear trend over time under the ambulatory protocol [F(1, 11) = 5. 74, p 0. 05] but nonsignificant temporal variation under the CR protocol.

40|$|Abstract-The {{interaction}} between "unhydrated " cations (those not {{separated from the}} surface by a solvent sheath) in hole positions and the montmorillonite surface was analyzed theoretically by considering the main contributions topotential energy from the coulombic, hydration, van der Waals, induced ipole, and repulsive nergies. The effects on these energy terms of {{the distance between the}} cation and the plane of basal oxygens, h, and of the angle of rotation of the silica tetrahedra, 0 were investigated. Increase of 0 with <b>h</b> <b>constant</b> increases the absolute values of {{all but one of the}} energy terms. The hydration energy is an exception because it is probably independent of 0. For a small cation, the increase in attraction is greater than the increase in repulsion when the value of 0 is sufficiently small. As 0 increases, the repulsive nergy becomes more and more dominant until a minimum potential energy is reached. For large cations, this minimum can occur only above a certain value of h. Thus, the values of the potential energy minimum and of 0 at this minimum depend on the cation under study as well as on h. Since the concentration f unhydrated cations in a montmorillonite-water system increases with decreasing water content, it is concluded that 0 increases during the drying of homogeneous montmorillonite-water suspensions. This provides a partial explanation for the changes in b-dimension with water content observed by other investigators...|$|E
