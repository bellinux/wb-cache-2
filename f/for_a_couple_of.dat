5|$|After an {{intersection}} with Shaver Road, US131 widens {{into a full}} freeway which passes the Gourdneck State Game Area as it enters the Kalamazoo metropolitan area.

This secondary designation leaves the freeway at exit36 and follows US131's business loop along Stadium Drive into downtown Kalamazoo near the main campus of Western Michigan University. As the freeway passes the west side of Kalamazoo the environs change to a more forested and semi-residential area. US131 passes the northern end of Bus.

5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached {{during the first}} week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African Americans would order food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to the merchants. The merchants would prepare their employees for the event and instruct them to serve the customers without trouble. This arrangement would continue in a controlled manner <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> weeks and then all controls would be taken off, at which point the merchants and protest leaders would reconvene to evaluate the results. Also as part of the agreement, the media was to be informed of the settlement and requested to provide only accurate, non-sensational coverage.|$|E

The family moved in 1775 to Wythe County, Virginia, where Alder's father died {{about a year}} later. In May 1782, Jonathan, at eight years old, was sent out with his brother David to search <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> horses that ran away. They were {{attacked}} by {{a small group of}} Shawnee Indians from Ohio. David saw the Indians first and tried to escape, but he was chased down, killed, and later scalped.

5|$|He was {{generally}} more highly regarded for his batting than his wicket-keeping, often drawing criticism {{for the quality}} of his glovework. Despite this, he was at times considered to be a better wicket-keeper than two of his rivals for England; Bairstow and Buttler. Nonetheless, playing in an era when international teams did not play specialist wicket-keepers, Kieswetter's selection was based primarily upon his batting ability, rather than his keeping ability. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> matches during 2012, he was used as an off spin bowler by Somerset, collecting three wickets.|$|E

A new team of talents won both the UEFA Cup and Allsvenskan once again in 1987, after beating Dundee United in the UEFA Cup final. The youth manager Roger Gustafsson took over the team from Gunder Bengtsson in 1990, and his time with IFK was to become very successful, winning Allsvenskan five times between 1990 and 1995.|$|E

50|$|These are notations for {{describing}} states of singly excited atoms, especially rare gas atoms.

LS <b>coupling</b> is <b>for</b> <b>a</b> parent ion and J1L2 <b>coupling</b> is <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> the parent ion and the excited electron. The parent ion is an unexcited part of the atom.
