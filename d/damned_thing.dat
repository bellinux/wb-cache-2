Robert Patrick later called the {{eventual}} set [...] "the biggest <b>damned</b> <b>thing</b> I'd seen in my life." [...] Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf and Matthew Mungle, the show's make-up effect producers, used several unorthodox ingredients to create the effect of melted flesh; in addition to the use of normal prosthetic make-up, the two also used a combination of figs and Fruit Roll-Ups.|$|E
500|$|Apple Records {{released}} Living in the Material World on 30 May 1973. [...] "Be Here Now" [...] {{appeared as}} the second track on side two of the original LP format, following what Rodriguez describes as the [...] "funky uptempo" [...] "The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)". It marked {{the first of four}} consecutive ballads on that side, which some music critics objected to at the time. Never a fan of Harrison's solo work, Robert Christgau would comment on the album: [...] "Harrison sings as if he's doing sitar impressions, and four different people, including a little man in my head who I never noticed before, have expressed intense gratitude when I turned the <b>damned</b> <b>thing</b> off during 'Be Here Now'." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{early as}} 1925, Nella Larsen {{had decided that}} she wanted to be among the [...] "New Negro" [...] writers {{receiving}} considerable attention at the time. Initially writing short stories that were sold early in 1926 to a ladies magazine, she was rumored that year to be writing a novel. In a letter to her friend, Carl Van Vechten, she acknowledges, [...] "it is the awful Truth. But, who knows if I'll get through with the <b>damned</b> <b>thing.</b> Certainly not I." [...] In April 1927, Larsen and her husband, Elmer Imes, moved from Jersey City, New Jersey to Harlem to be closer to the cultural phenomenon. The following year, Larsen published her first novel Quicksand with New York-based publisher Knopf, and its favorable critical reception encouraged her ambitions to become known as a novelist.|$|E
500|$|... "Medusa" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz and directed by Richard Compton. Reportedly, because {{of the scope of}} the episode, a [...] "huge budget" [...] was allotted for the entry. Because the episode was written to take place in a subway system, a set meeting the requirements of the script had to be created. The eventual set was designed to mirror the actual Boston subway, a system that serves more than 700,000 people a day. According to star Robert Patrick, [...] "They got us in there, and we did it, and they built a huge subway tunnel set on a soundstage." [...] Patrick later described the set as [...] "the biggest <b>damned</b> <b>thing</b> I'd ever seen in my life." [...] In real life, the Boston subway system is [...] "fondly" [...] called the T, short for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. In [...] "Medusa", the [...] "T", was changed to an [...] "M" [...] "for fictional purposes".|$|E
500|$|From late 1910 {{to early}} 1912, Cerna {{was at the}} University of Leipzig, where he {{attended}} courses held by the philosophers and psychologists Wilhelm Wundt, Eduard Spranger and Hans Volkelt. Wundt left an enduring impression on his Romanian student. In a letter home, Cerna described his modest appearance, which he claimed recalled that of [...] "decrepit" [...] Orthodox members of the Romanian Jewish community, adding: [...] "But I do love this decrepit exterior beyond measure..." [...] Volkelt guided Cerna's research in the scientific field, and coordinated his PhD thesis of 1913, Die Gedankenlyrik (German for [...] "Contemplative Poetry"). According to Călinescu, Cerna's work stated the primacy of [...] "natural ideas" [...] over reasoning, and concluded that [...] "ideas have the purpose of signaling the problematic tensions of the soul." [...] Zarifopol wrote that Cerna was upset over having himself parted with writing poetry, and came to be preoccupied by Maiorescu's German-language dictum: In der Poesie ist der Gedanke ein verfluchtes Ding ("An idea is a <b>damned</b> <b>thing</b> {{when it comes to}} poetry"). Panait Cerna's first volume of collected poetry was published at home in 1910, and, two years later, resulted in the author being made a co-recipient of the Romanian Academy's Vasile Adamachi Award. Some of his new poems were still being published by Convorbiri Literare in 1911.|$|E
