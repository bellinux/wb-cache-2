500|$|Singer {{described}} {{the film as}} Double Indemnity meets Rashomon, and {{said that it was}} made [...] "so you can go back and see all sorts of things you didn't realize were there the first time. You can get it a second time <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> never could have the first time around." [...] He also compared the film's structure to Citizen Kane (which also contained an interrogator and a subject who is telling a story) and the criminal caper The Anderson Tapes.|$|E
500|$|David had {{intended}} to publish a second such volume, and eight years after the author's death, Norman, her literary executor, published a sequel, Is There a Nutmeg in the House? (2000). Like its predecessor, it was drawn from magazine articles, essays and other earlier writings, to which Norman added articles written by David in the 1980s. The first section {{of the book is}} a short autobiographical piece, a rarity from David, who guarded her privacy carefully. David's interest in the historical aspects of cuisine is given scope in essays on the history of Oxo and Bovril, Alexis Soyer and the potato. Articles aimed at the domestic cook include [...] "Do not Despair over Rice", [...] "Making Ice Cream", and one propounding a view for which she was famous: [...] "Garlic Presses are Utterly Useless". The New York Times called the book [...] "this very appealing, completely absorbing miscellany.... This is a book good enough to eat—and, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> can." ...|$|E
500|$|Scottish actor Kevin McKidd, who {{had never}} {{appeared}} in a television series that necessitated over twelve months of filming, was cast as Lucius Vorenus, one of the lead characters. McKidd said, [...] "What was different about this show is you get 14 months to really get into {{every nook and cranny}} of the character, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> don't get a chance to explore when you do a movie or a theater play. Initially, it was a terrifying prospect. But once you got over that, you realize what a great opportunity it was." [...] Heller described his character as [...] "very much a Roman of the Old School, a stoic man devoted to duty and religion and the legion." [...] Ray Stevenson played Titus Pullo, a soldier who befriends Vorenus. McKidd said that [...] "they're kind of thrown together by fate, by chance, but somewhere along the line they start to stick... keep finding themselves accidentally at the epicenter of tumultuous events and immense change, so they're kind of clinging to each other." ...|$|E

I've had to {{come down}} to it, old man--I tried to do it a month ago when Losada's man was here turning things over; but I couldn't do it then. Now it's different. I want a thousand dollars, Goodwin; and you'll have to give it to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Bennet, {{how can you}} abuse {{your own}} {{children}} <b>in</b> such <b>a</b> <b>way?</b> <b>You</b> take delight <b>in</b> vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You've seen me before, you know,' he said, {{grinning}} slightly. 'Perhaps {{you never}} noticed me. Oh, I'm quite nice looking, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> quiet <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> know. What--?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Queensberry's next letter {{threatened}} his {{son with}} a [...] "thrashing" [...] and {{accused him of}} being [...] "crazy". He also threatened to [...] "make a public scandal <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> little dream of" [...] if he continued his relationship with Wilde.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of the band's music and lyrics were written by Patton, Dunn, and Spruance, with McKinnon and Heifetz occasionally contributing. Regarding their creative process, Bär McKinnon stated in a 2000 interview that [...] "This band {{is kind of like}} a cruel boys club <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> bring some ideas and if you're not 100 percent firm about bringing a certain idea to this group, you can watch it get kicked aside and die really quickly." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "My father... {{took us to}} see one of {{the first}} talking pictures, The Singing Fool, in which Al Jolson sang [...] "Sonny Boy". <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> could say that Jolson was my {{earliest}} influence as a singer. I was so excited by what I saw that I spent hours listening to Jolson and Eddie Cantor on the radio. In fact, I staged my first public performance shortly after seeing that movie... to imitate Jolson... I leaped {{into the living room and}} announced to the adults, who were staring at me in amazement, 'Me Sonny Boy!' The whole family roared with laughter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{heard that}} {{you used to be}} very fond of Eustacia--nothing more than that, though dropped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bit-by-bit <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> ought not to be angry!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{the place}} where old and damaged trucks and {{carriages}} are sent for repair. They're all <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bad <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> see,--much <b>in</b> need o' the doctor's sar'vices." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's obvious," [...] said Helen, with a smile. [...] "Still, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> perhaps, <b>you</b> {{were not}} so very wrong. Bob was {{something}} of a wastrel; his wife has made him a useful man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> {{are very}} much alike. You have both always had large private means, and have never had the {{wholesome}} discipline of work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{you know}} that, do you, you mischievous Imp? Then, for once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> just know wrong!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Peckover, losing her temper altogether.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} are happier about your {{marriage}} than you seem," [...] her aunt observed. [...] "Charles is quite a parti, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> know, although he is not rich." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am going}} to ask you a {{question}} now,' said Knight, somewhat awkwardly. 'I only ask it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> whimsical <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> know: not with great seriousness, Elfride. You may think it odd, perhaps.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, Polly," [...] {{interrupted}} the captain, with a smile, [...] "but I meant about money <b>in</b> <b>a</b> business <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> know, {{because if you}} chanced, d'ee see, ever to be in England without me, you know,--it--" ...|$|R
5000|$|Dawson's {{authentic}} persona has a demeanor {{which is}} [...] "sheepish and guileless and awkward <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that <b>you</b> really can't fake" [...] and who sometimes looks [...] "legitimately terrified" [...] during performances, according to Village Voice music critic Rob Harvilla.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly I shall {{do nothing}} of the kind," [...] {{retorted}} Corey. [...] "I can't listen to you any longer. What you say is shocking to me--shocking <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> can't think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] said Lingard; [...] "I picked you up as a boy, and {{consider}} myself responsible for you <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> took your life {{into your own}} hands many years ago--but still [...] ." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid that}} Gregory's in rather serious trouble. Sally seems very anxious about him," [...] he said. [...] "It's rather a {{delicate}} subject, but I understand that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> general <b>way</b> <b>you</b> are {{on good terms}} with both of them?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Disabled people {{understand}} the world <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> understand what it's like to be stared at...

6000|$|... "If I go myself," [...] Miss Haldin argued, [...] "I can go {{straight}} {{to him from the}} hotel. And in any case I should have to go out, because I must explain to Mr. Razumov personally--prepare him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> have no idea of mother's state of mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, indeed!" [...] said she--all in {{hurry and}} heat--"you may think to check and hold me in, {{as much as}} you please; but I have talked about it, and heard about it too; and a great deal and lately, and disagreeably and detrimentally: and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't approve." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You shut up!" [...] {{cried the}} stranger, {{and he gave}} Dave a shove that sent him back on the bed. [...] "You make any more noise and I'll quiet you <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> won't like!" [...] And then the fellow left the room again, and {{the door was locked}} as before.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, there is," [...] she returned. [...] "If you've {{been born}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> certain <b>way,</b> {{and brought up}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> certain <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> can't get out of it. You simply can't. You have got to keep in it till you drop. Or a woman has." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He wasn't very explicit, but {{he seemed}} to feel he had a {{grievance}} against Gregory. Of course, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> can't blame Gregory. He's in charge, and it isn't in him to carry out Harry's policy. This fall in wheat is getting on his nerves, and in any case he'd probably have held his hand and cut down the crop next year." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{those who}} scaled, {{found out that}} their advance [...] Was favour'd by an {{accident}} or blunder: [...] The Greek or Turkish Cohorn's ignorance [...] Had palisado'd <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> 'd wonder [...] To see in forts of Netherlands or France [...] (Though these to our Gibraltar must knock under)-- [...] Right {{in the middle of}} the parapet [...] Just named, these palisades were primly set: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You overdo it. It {{would be}} wiser {{to admit that}} you are curious.

6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} can dismiss the other two servants, if you like," [...] said Rosamond; [...] "but I should have {{thought it would be}} very {{injurious}} to your position for us to live <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> must expect your practice to be lowered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{doubt about}} that, I fancy," [...] Meddoes {{answered}} lightly. [...] "He ran some Austrian fellow off.

6000|$|... "Oh, haven't I, though?" [...] said Sir Hugo, provokingly.
