40|$|Abstract. Inui and Katori {{introduced}} Fermi walk configurations {{which are}} non-crossing subsets of the directed random walks between opposite corners of a rectangular × w grid. They related them to Bose configurations which are similarly defined {{except that they}} include multisets. Bose configurations biject to vicious walker watermelon configurations. It is found that <b>the</b> maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> walks in a Fermi configuration is w + 1 and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> configurations corresponding to this <b>number</b> <b>of</b> walks is a w−dimensional Catalan number C,w. Product formulae <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> Fermi configurations with w and w − 1 walks are derived. We also consider generating functions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> n−walk configurations {{as a function of}} and w. The Bose generating function is rational with denominator (1 −z) w+ 1. The Fermi generating function is a polynomial which is found to have a factor (1 +z) +w. The complementary factor QFermi,w (z) is related to the numerator of the Bose generating function which is a generalised Naryana polynomial introduced by Sulanke. Recurrence relations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> Fermi walks and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> coefficients of the polynomial QFermi,w (z) are obtained. Fermi configurations are such that only one walker can follow a given path; extension to configurations in which <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> walkers on any path is limited to m ≥ 1 is discussed...|$|R

5|$|By {{the evening}} of 21 August 1944, the vast {{majority}} of the German forces remaining in the Falaise Pocket had surrendered. Nearly all of the strong German formations that had caused significant damage to the Canadian 1st Army throughout the Normandy campaign had been destroyed. Two panzer divisions—the Panzer Lehr and 9th SS—now existed in name only. The formidable 12th SS Panzer Division had lost 94% of its armour, nearly all of its field-guns and 70% of its vehicles. Several German units, notably the 2nd and the 12th SS Panzer Divisions had managed to escape east toward the Seine River, albeit without most of their motorized equipment. Conservative estimates <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> German soldiers captured in the Falaise Pocket approach 50,000, although some estimates put total German losses (killed and captured) in the Pocket as high as 200,000.|$|E

5|$|Estimates <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{soldiers}} and casualties {{at the battle}} vary widely. A Song source reports that there were 18,000 Song soldiers stationed in Caishi, a number that historian Herbert Franke considers plausible. However, Song estimates <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Jin troops are likely inflated. One document claims that 400,000 Jin soldiers were present at the battle. This number is doubtful, bearing {{in mind that the}} Song had only 120,000 soldiers fighting on the entire front. Song historians may have confused the total number of Jin personnel deployed on the front with the number of Jin combatants at Caishi. The inflated figure could have referred to the number of soldiers that the Jin army had before crossing the Huai River toward the Yangtze. The desertions and casualties from suppressing revolts while advancing southward would have shrunk that number by the time the Jin reached the Yangtze. The History of Jin, a document written {{from the perspective of the}} Jin, reports Jin casualties between one meng'an (a Jurchen unit of a thousand soldiers) and a hundred men, and two meng'an and two hundred men. The History of Song reports Jin casualties numbering four thousand {{soldiers and}} two commanders of wanhu (ten thousand men) rank. An account of the battle by a different Song source holds that 24,000 Jin soldiers died and that 500 combatants and five meng-an were taken as prisoners. A more conservative Song source estimates that the Jin only had 500 soldiers and 20 ships at Caishi. It is not certain which of these figures is more accurate; Franke believes that the safest conclusion that can be drawn is that the number of Jin casualties was not greater than four thousand.|$|E
