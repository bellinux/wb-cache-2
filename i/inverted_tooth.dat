50|$|The CM250TB {{is based}} on the Honda Superdream CB250N engine but with a {{five-speed}} and not six-speed gearbox. The model is instead characterised by its North American cruiser styling with stepped seat, high handlebars, 'megaphone' exhaust silencers, teardrop-shaped tank and many chromium-plated and polished alloy parts. The quality of the chromium finish and polished alloy meant corrosion was a problem, the outside of the engine casings becoming white and furring up in damp or winter conditions. Particularly vulnerable to deterioration in finish was the exhaust system balance box. Moreover, the front disc brake was also noted as likely to seize as a result of low resistance to corrosion. For the 1982 and 1984 production years, CM250C had a chain drive whilst in the 1983 production year it featured a belt drive. The CM250T has an <b>inverted</b> <b>tooth</b> type camchain and was fitted with Honda Comstar cast alloy wheels as standard.|$|E

40|$|Thursday Morning Posters: PZ 03. 20 INTRODUCTION: Tooth {{impaction}} {{in primary}} dentition {{is a rare}} phenomenon. Among the few reported cases, primary second molars are most frequently involved, followed by primary central incisors and first molars. Reported contributing factors include: mechanical obstruction {{in the path of}} eruption, like odontomes and ameloblastic fibroma, ectopic position of tooth germ due to trauma or other reasons, primary failure of eruption, ankylosis, infection and interferences of tooth development. CASE REPORT: A 5 -year-old Chinese girl visited with a complaint of missing bilateral primary maxillary central incisors. Medical history was non-contributory, and there was no known history of intra-oral infection or trauma. Pregnancy and delivery were normal. Patient had finger-sucking habit since birth. There were callus and peeling on her fingers. Clinical examination identified moderate enlargement in the buccal aspect of the alveolus in the missing teeth 51 and 61 region with no pain in palpation. Teeth 72 and 82 were in crossbite. Radiographic examination revealed that teeth 51 and 61 were inverted with open apexes and incomplete root formation. The <b>inverted</b> <b>teeth</b> were near to the displaced permanent tooth germs of 11 and 21. The <b>inverted</b> <b>teeth</b> 51 and 61 were then surgically removed under general anaesthesia. The patient was regularly reviewed. Permanent teeth 11 and 21 in good condition erupted in a displaced position two years after. COMMENTS: Finger-sucking habit may be the contributing factor to the impaction. Primary teeth impaction could affect the eruption and development of their permanent successors. Early diagnosis and intervention are necessary...|$|R

40|$|Introduction/Aim. Patients with mandibular prognathism as {{dominant}} symptom have disordered sagittal interjaw {{relations that}} make prominent appearance to this dental craniofacial anomaly beside hyperplastic mandibles and <b>inverted</b> front <b>teeth</b> overlap. The {{aim of this}} study was to examine the differences in dimensions of sella turcica in patients with mandibular prognathism and in eugnathic. Methods. On profile teleradiographs of 30 eugnathic control and 30 patients with mandibular prognathism, three parameters, which represent dimensions of sella turcica, were measured (surface, width and depth). Results. Statistically significant difference in values between the groups was found. All the three measured parameters were significantly higher in the patients with mandibular prognathism (p < 0. 01). Conclusion. In the patients with mandibular prognathism all the measured dimensions of sella turcica were bigger, and so was sella turcica, but that enlargement was not in correlation with the degree of anomaly itself...|$|R
40|$|Eruption of an <b>inverted</b> <b>tooth</b> {{is a rare}} condition. This {{case report}} {{describes}} the inverted eruption of a supplemental lower premolar in a 10 -year-old Caucasian female. The tooth erupted in a downward direction and reached the lower cortical border of the mandible 2 years later. During an 8 -year follow-up period, the tooth did not interfere with eruption of permanent teeth and the patient remained symptom-free. Considering clinical examination, medical and dental history as well as scientific evidence, the inverted eruption was most likely caused by a developmental abnormality with an inverted location of the tooth bud. This reported eruption of an <b>inverted</b> <b>tooth</b> is extremely rare and requires a radiographic follow-up to evaluate the relative position of this tooth in the jaw bone and its potential interference with neighbouring teeth or anatomic structures. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{describe}} the clinical and radiological features {{of children with}} inverted supernumerary teeth. Study Design: Thirty eight patients with inverted supernumerary teeth (ST) were enrolled in this descriptive and restrospective study. Data from patient records including age, gender, status of dentition, number of ST, number of ST in inverted position, coexistence of ST in inverted and normal direction of eruption, location, orientation, morphology, clinical complications, management and radiography were assessed during 3 -years period. Results: Thirty eight patients {{with a mean age}} of 9. 10 ± 1. 97 years (range: 6 - 13) and a strong male preponderance of 3. 7 : 1 (male: 30, female: 8) had a total of 69 ST, of which 41 were in inverted position. Thirty five patients had one (92. 1 %) <b>inverted</b> <b>tooth,</b> whereas 3 patients had two inverted teeth per case (7. 9 %). All cases were located in the maxilla. Midline was the most frequent site for the single inverted supernumerary tooth in 18 (47. 4 %) patients, followed equally by the right and left premaxillary region in 10 patients each (26. 3 %). Regarding morphology, 30 patients had conical (78. 9 %) and 8 (21. 1 %) had incisiform ST. No tuberculate shaped ST was detected. There was no statistically significant difference between number of inverted teeth and delayed tooth eruption, diastema, local malocclusion, palatinal swelling (p> 0. 05). There was no statistically significant difference between complications and age (p> 0. 05). Surgical removal at the time of diagnosis with subsequent follow-up during completion of permanent dentition was the treatment approach in all cases. Conclusions: Thorough clinical examination followed by a comprehensive radiographic screening is the crucial determinant of an accurate diagnosis of an impacted ST. Early diagnosis and timely management are key factors to prevent or minimize the complications, which may influence function and esthetics of the teeth and even psychological condition of the growing child...|$|E
