That metal is used in special steels and alloys for jet engine components, rocket sub-assemblies, and <b>heat-resisting</b> and combustion equipment.

He and his research group have worked on applications for nickel-based superalloys, titanium alloys and <b>heat-resisting</b> steels, particularly for jet engine applications.

50|$|Ablatives - Ablative {{materials}} {{are defined as}} polymer or resin with low thermal conductivity which pyrolize layer by layer when its surface is heated, leaving a <b>heat-resisting</b> layer of charred material which eventually breaks away to expose virgin material. Lewcott missile cone ablative {{materials are}} available in broad goods, molding compound, biased tapes and straight tapes. Many of their ablative and carbon/carbon materials exceed the requirements for the aerospace industry.|$|E
50|$|Induction {{equipment}} may be {{a built-in}} surface, part of a range, or a standalone surface unit. Built-in and rangetop units typically have multiple elements, the equivalent of separate burners on a gas-fueled range. Stand-alone induction modules are usually single-element, or sometimes have dual elements. All such elements share a basic design: an electromagnet sealed beneath a <b>heat-resisting</b> glass-ceramic sheet that is easily cleaned. The pot {{is placed on the}} ceramic glass surface and begins to heat up, along with its contents.|$|E
50|$|A {{main goal}} when {{producing}} carburized workpieces {{is to ensure}} maximum contact between the workpiece surface and the carbon-rich elements. In gas and liquid carburizing, the workpieces are often supported in mesh baskets or suspended by wire. In pack carburizing, the workpiece and carbon are enclosed in a container to ensure that contact is maintained over as much surface area as possible. Pack carburizing containers are usually made of carbon steel coated with aluminum or <b>heat-resisting</b> nickel-chromium alloy and sealed at all openings with fire clay.|$|E
50|$|The firebox had a {{power-operated}} Ajax fire-door and {{the grate}} {{was of the}} sectional pin-hole type, fitted with power-operated shaking gear. To assist in keeping within the axle load limits, the ashpan was constructed of relatively thin anti-corrosive steel plates of a special <b>heat-resisting</b> quality. The brick arch was supported by five 3 in diameter arch tubes. The firebox was fitted with SAR standard type flexible stays and to allow easier access to the stays, the engine was equipped with a Watson cab with its slanted front which, like the Watson Standard boiler, was to become the standard on later SAR steam locomotive classes. The cab was of special light steel and was welded throughout.|$|E
5000|$|Where the {{rheostat}} must {{be rated}} for higher power (more than about 1 watt), {{it may be}} built with a resistance wire wound around a semicircular insulator, with the wiper sliding from one turn of the wire to the next. Sometimes a rheostat is made from resistance wire wound on a <b>heat-resisting</b> cylinder, with the slider made {{from a number of}} metal fingers that grip lightly onto {{a small portion of the}} turns of resistance wire. The [...] "fingers" [...] can be moved along the coil of resistance wire by a sliding knob thus changing the [...] "tapping" [...] point. Wire-wound rheostats made with ratings up to several thousand watts are used in applications such as DC motor drives, electric welding controls, or in the controls for generators. The rating of the rheostat is given with the full resistance value and the allowable power dissipation is proportional to the fraction of the total device resistance in circuit.|$|E
50|$|The Mercantile Bank {{is located}} on Old Market Square, Kuala Lumpur. It cost $4 million, and {{consisted}} of two floors below street level and 11 floors above. It is 144 feet high and has a total floor area of over 100,000 square feet. The whole {{upper part of the}} building is sheathed with a gold anodised aluminum grille which lent the structure a distinctive appearance. The grille was not only decorative, it deflected the sun’s ray and thus, in conjunction with <b>heat-resisting</b> glass, saved considerably on cooling costs. Marble paving and wall cladding gave an air of luxury to the main floors. The columns on the ground floor entrance foyer were black Venetian mosaic. The entry floor surface utilized white marble paving and was enclosed in glass and aluminum. The main banking hall featured white Italian marble floors and teak paneled walls. The entire building was air-conditioned. The plant for this, plus machinery for three fully automatic lifts, controlled by an intricate electronic “brain”, was on the roof. It is now occupied by Pacific Express Hotel.|$|E
50|$|The Doble Detroit {{incorporated}} key ignition, {{doing away}} {{with the need for}} manual ignition of the boiler system. John Doble also constructed a flash boiler with rectangular casing in which atomized kerosene fuel was ignited with a spark plug, in a carburetor-type venturi and used forced draft provided by an electrically driven fan. This rapidly heated the feedwater contained in vertical grids of tubes welded to horizontal headers. The steam-raising part of the boiler was partitioned off by a wall of <b>heat-resisting</b> material jacketed with planished steel from a smaller compartment in which were similar grids of tubes for feedwater heating. There seem to have been at least two versions of this boiler, the first with the burner and combustion chamber at the bottom, the other with them {{at the top of the}} casing; this led to the subsequent counterflow monotube boiler arrangement. Boiler operation was fully electro-mechanically automated: the bottom of the boiler housed a metal tray with a row of quartz rods. As heat increased, the tray expanded, pushing the rods forward and shutting off the burner. As the system cooled, the quartz rods receded, engaging the burner.|$|E

It is shown that fcc-based [gamma]- and [gamma]'-phases are primary in all states of the alloy. [gamma]'-phase has L 12 structure, while [gamma]-phase is a disordered phase.

Based on initial results, an fe- 10 cr- 11 ni- 5 si alloy and an fe- 8 cr- 13 ni- 5 si alloy were selected for evaluation of oxidation, stress rupture, and tensile properties. Both alloys have oxidation resistance at 700 deg and 800 deg c that is better than that of type 304 stainless steel. The stress rupture strengths are less than that of type 304 stainless steel but significantly better than that of commericial <b>heat-resisting</b> steels with similar cr contents. Yield strengths of the alloys were equivalent to that of type 304. Both alloys had high tensile strengths comparable to those of stainless steels that transform to martensite during straining (e. g., type 301). These alloys have weld-hot-cracking resistance comparable to that of type 304 stainless steel.
