5|$|Clay and <b>fine</b> <b>silt,</b> {{dominated}} by lutite, were {{deposited in the}} lake. Closer to the shore, sand was also emplaced. Deltaic deposits have been found as well. Minerals identified include biotite, chlorite, illite, kaolinite, montmorillonite and muscovite, with varying colors depending {{on the origin of}} the sediments. The material deposited by Lake Cahuilla is also known as the Cahuilla formation. The Borrego and Pleistocene Brawley formations may also be linked to Lake Cahuilla. These lacustrine materials bury {{the northern part of the}} Colorado River Delta, and they give the ground a grayish color. The clays left by the lake were used for the production of ceramic by the inhabitants of the region; likewise Lake Cahuilla is responsible for the fertile soils of the Coachella Valley and Imperial Valley, an important agricultural province of the United States. Halite deposits left by the lake were mined in the 19-20th century.|$|E
5|$|Uplift {{from the}} Laramide paused {{briefly in the}} Eocene. Meandering streams flowed slowly over the {{resulting}} broad and almost featureless plains. Periodic but extensive floods inundated large areas perhaps once every 1,000 years; spreading mud, cobbles and <b>fine</b> <b>silt</b> over the plains. Erosion incised these deposits between flood events and plant growth was abundant. Oxidation of the iron {{in the mud and}} silt turned the soil into hematite, giving it a pink and red hue. These sediments were later lithified into the up-to- -thick Pink Member of the locally Eocene-aged Claron Formation (previously called the Wasatch Formation). Channelized conglomerates of this member can be easily seen in Red Canyon along State Route 12 while its silt and mudstones compose most of the park's fragile and colorful spires called hoodoos. Geologist Clarence Dutton called the iron oxide-rich lower member of the Claron the Pink Cliffs series due to its colorful appearance.|$|E
25|$|Detailed {{analysis}} of the fine-grained rock using optical mineralogy, X-ray crystallography, and electron microprobe has determined that the boulders consist of mud, <b>fine</b> <b>silt</b> and clay, cemented by calcite. The degree of cementation varies from being relatively weak {{in the interior of}} a boulder to quite hard at its outside rim. The outside rims of the larger boulders consist of as much as 10 to 20% calcite because the calcite not only tightly cements the silt and clay but has also replaced it to a significant degree.|$|E

50|$|Lake {{deposited}} {{parent material}} is called lacustrine parent material. Beach ridges {{may be present}} where glacial lakes once washed up sand. Lacustrine material is well sorted and fine-textured, having <b>finer</b> <b>silts</b> and clays. Soils formed from lacustrine parent material have low permeability {{in part because of}} this high clay content.|$|R
25|$|Past floods have {{resulted}} in both deepening and reduction in river depth, creation of new sand banks and shoals as well as increased transport of suspended sediment from upstream. Before the invention of modern dredging techniques the sediment deposited by flooding created hazards to ships navigating the river. Even medium-sized vessels no longer travel up the Brisbane River beyond the city reach, and dredging of the upper reaches has ceased, allowing the river to recover substantially from the <b>fine</b> <b>silt</b> dislodged by gravel and sand extraction.|$|E
25|$|The {{feeding method}} of tadpole shrimps {{is similar to}} that {{proposed}} for the ancestral crustacean. The anterior appendages (second pair to tenth pair) stir sediments and swirl muddy water into the wide, midventral food groove. The gnathobases (inward-facing lobes {{at the base of the}} leg) guide food anteriorly to the mouth. The large flat exopods (outward-facing lobes at the end of the leg) stir and lift the sediments. <b>Fine</b> <b>silt</b> particles and water escape easily, but large, coarse food particles are torn into smaller pieces by the blade-like, inward-facing lobes called endopods at the end of the leg.|$|E
500|$|Mega {{ripple marks}} formed by gravel {{are also found}} in the Cerro Blanco area and are among the most extreme on Earth. These are formed from wind-driven {{processes}} acting on local ignimbrites, including saltation of fine grains and sand during wind. Ripples have amplitudes varying [...] and wavelengths of [...] Coarse gravel is found at their top and more <b>fine</b> <b>silt</b> in their lower parts. Pumice blocks are found in the lee surfaces of the ripples, with the interripple areas relatively flat. Unlike dunes these structures do not migrate once stably formed.

These ripple marks have been compared to Martian ripple fields.|$|E

50|$|The lagoon and {{tidal flat}} area is located behind the dune and {{backshore}} area. Here {{the water is}} still and this allows for <b>fine</b> <b>silts,</b> sands, and mud to settle out.

2500|$|In {{the lower}} tidal reaches the Trent {{has a high}} {{sediment}} load, this <b>fine</b> <b>silt</b> which {{is also known as}} ‘warp', was used to improve the soil by a process known as warping, whereby river water was allowed to flood into adjacent fields through a series of warping drains, enabling the silt to settle out across the land.

A number of the smaller Trent tributaries are still named as warping drains, such as Morton warping drain, near Gainsborough.|$|E
2500|$|The figure presumably {{dates to}} [...] "the later prehistory", i.e. the Iron Age (800 BC–AD 100) or the late Bronze Age (1000–700 BC). This view was {{generally}} held by scholars {{even before the}} 1990s, based on the similarity of the horse's design to comparable figures in Celtic art, and it was confirmed following a 1990 excavation led by Simon Palmer and David Miles of the Oxford Archaeological Unit, following which deposits of <b>fine</b> <b>silt</b> removed from the horse's 'beak' were scientifically dated to the late Bronze Age, sometime between 1380 and 550 BCE.

2500|$|The delta of the Irrawaddy begins about [...] above Hinthada (Henzada) {{and about}} [...] from its curved base, which faces the Andaman Sea. The westernmost {{distributary}} {{of the delta}} is the Pathein (Bassein) River, while the easternmost stream is the Yangon River, on the left bank of which stands Myanmar's former capital city, Yangon (Rangoon). Because the Yangon River is only a minor channel, {{the flow of water}} is insufficient to prevent Yangon Harbour from silting up, and dredging is necessary. The relief of the delta's landscape is low but not flat. The soils consist of <b>fine</b> <b>silt,</b> which is replenished continuously by fertile alluvium carried downstream by the river. As a result of heavy rainfall varying from [...] a year in the delta, and the motion and sediment load of the river, the delta surface extends into the Andaman Sea {{at a rate of about}} [...] per year.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} geology, {{overlying}} the rather older Hythe, Sandgate and Folkestone Beds under even deeper seas, Gault Clay and the Upper Greensand were deposited.

50|$|The {{particle}} size distribution of a soil sample may indicate {{the conditions under which}} the strata or sediment were deposited. Particle sizes are generally separated by means of dry or wet sieving (coarse samples such as till, gravel and sands, sometimes coarser silts) or by measuring the changes of the density of a dispersed solution (in sodiumpyrophosphate, for example))of the sample (<b>finer</b> <b>silts,</b> clays). A rotating clock-glass with a very fine-grained dispersed sample under a heat lamp is useful in separating particles.|$|R
25|$|The bay's {{currents}} and circulation patterns greatly influence the sediment deposits within the region.

Scientists {{have been able to}} identify 11 types of sediment that range from course gravels to <b>fine</b> <b>silts.</b> The bay's currents deposit fine materials through the harbors of the lower and middle sections of the bay, and the coarse, heavy materials are deposited in the lower areas of the bay where the water velocities are higher.|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} of 10 years of maize culture {{was performed by}} incubation of industrial soil highly contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and containing exclusively anthropogenic organic matter (OM) mixed with maize residue. The aim was to evaluate {{the impact of the}} fresh OM incorporation on the soil structure and consequently on the contaminants repartition, concentration and availability. Water granulodensimetric fractionation was carried out to isolate five water stable material fractions (coarse and fine sands, coarse and <b>fine</b> <b>silts</b> and clays). The evolution of the added maize repartition in these fractions was followed using δ 13 C. Total and available PAH content in the bulk soil {{as well as in the}} different fractions were determined by solvent and Tenax® resin extraction respectively. The monitoring of soil structure showed an aggregation process in the amended soil after 3 months of incubation probably due to the promoting of microbial activity. Among the different fractions, <b>fine</b> <b>silts</b> distinguished themselves by enrichment in total organic carbon and in δ 13 C due to the added carbon. However, the results showed no significant impact on pollution, which remained stable in terms of concentration, distribution and availability. This experiment suggests that a culture on this soil wouldn’t mobilize the pollution...|$|R

50|$|Whilst {{engineers}} can use dewatering to lower a groundwater table, or to drain soils, {{they can also}} use the process to control pore pressure in soils and avoid damage to structures by base heave. High pore pressures occur in soils composed of <b>fine</b> <b>silts</b> or clays. Since these soils have a very low permeability, dewatering in a traditional sense (gravity flow into an abstraction well) may prove very costly or even futile. Instead, a vacuum-assisted dewatering scheme, such as ejector wells, or vacuum-sealed deep wells may serve to draw water into a well for abstraction.|$|R
