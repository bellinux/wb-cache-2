500|$|Regarding the 1939 New York World's Fair {{itself and}} its futuristic theme of the World of Tomorrow, Conran noted: [...] "...obviously the title refers to the World Expo {{and the spirit of}} that was looking at the future with a sense of {{optimism}} and a sense of the whimsical, you know, something that we've lost a lot in our fantasies. We're more cynical, more practical, ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> film attempts to do is to take that enthusiasm and innocence and celebrate it-to not get mired in the practicality that we're fixated upon today." ...|$|E

When {{anything}} big is doing the newspaper guys interview him and his name is in all the lists of subscriptions to charity--when they're going to be published in the papers. I'll bet he takes nine-tenths of his kale from women and children, and he's an honored citizen. I ain't no angel, but whatever I've taken didn't cause nobody any sufferin'--I'm a thief, bo, and I'm mighty proud of it when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>what</b> <b>this</b> other guy is." ...|$|R
5000|$|During a House vote on June 18, 2013, Swalwell {{recorded}} {{a video of}} his vote against {{a bill that would}} ban abortions after 20 weeks to his mobile phone (the video was a six-second clip of him pressing the [...] "nay" [...] button on the electronic voting machine) and uploaded it to Vine, an internet video service. House rules bar [...] "the use of mobile electronic devices that impair decorum" [...] and provide that [...] "No device may be used for still photography or for audio or video recording." [...] Swalwell defended the action, stating [...] "We operate under rules that were created in the eighteenth century, and I think it's time that the Congress start to act more like regular Americans do. I did not see this as impairing the decorum. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> did was highlight, for all to see, the democratic process." ...|$|E
500|$|John Lasseter, {{executive}} producer of Bolt, decided to make [...] "I Thought I Lost You" [...] the theme for Bolt, since it lyrically summarized the film's plot. He said, [...] " [...] so sums up {{the theme of this}} film. You know, a dog and its owner and they both were separated, but they love each other so much — there's such an emotional payoff when these characters get reunited, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>this</b> song's about." [...] Lasseter thought that solely the song worked, but it worked better for the film. [...] "I Thought I Lost You" [...] is one of two songs on the Bolt soundtrack and was released to Radio Disney to promote Bolt and its accompanying soundtrack.|$|R

[...] "That's probably what you calculated <b>I</b> would <b>think,</b> eh? <b>What</b> <b>this</b> evening has been you've seen, and I must allow that your hand's in it. That you know for yourself--that you doubtless felt as you sat there. But I confess I don't imagine what you want of me here now," [...] she added. She had remained standing in the path.|$|R
5000|$|From childhood, Hesse {{appeared}} headstrong {{and hard}} {{for his family}} to handle. In a letter to her husband, Hermann's mother Marie wrote: [...] "The little fellow has a life in him, an unbelievable strength, a powerful will, and, for his four years of age, a truly astonishing mind. How can he express all that? It truly gnaws at my life, this internal fighting against his tyrannical temperament, his passionate turbulence ... God must shape this proud spirit, then it will become something noble and magnificent - but <b>I</b> shudder to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> young and passionate person might become should his upbringing be false or weak." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> {{happened}} between <b>this</b> album {{and the last}} album is that everything has been happening nice for me. My life is getting better all the time, and Im happy, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that its reflected in the music. - George Harrison, 1979 With Harrisons penchant for leisure and travel following Thirty Three & 1/3s release, he had not started recording a follow-up until the spring of 1978, although he had been writing songs during his hiatus. Harrison decided to work with Russ Titelman as co-producer for George Harrison, which was recorded in his home studio at Friar Park, with string overdubs being effected at Londons AIR Studios. Special guests included Steve Winwood, Gary Wright (who co-wrote [...] "If You Believe") and Eric Clapton.|$|R
500|$|... "Butterflies" [...] was {{recorded}} by Michael Jackson in 2001 for his tenth studio album, Invincible, which was released the same year. The song {{was written by}} Andre Harris and Marsha Ambrosius, who is {{one half of the}} London bred neo-soul act Floetry, and was produced by Jackson and Harris. Jackson first met Ambrosius and Natalie Stewart, who {{is also a member of}} Floetry, through John McClain, who is DreamWorks's senior urban executive and Jackson's manager. Stewart said she was surprised that Jackson invited her and Ambrosius to a studio and asked for their input on the recording of the track. She recalled in an interview with LAUNCH magazine, [...] "It was incredible because he asked, he continually asked, 'Marsh, what's the next harmony? Girls, does <b>this</b> sound right? <b>What</b> do you <b>think?</b> <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>what</b> you were looking for? He was so open".|$|R
5000|$|New Release Tuesdays Sarah Fine {{referred}} to the album [...] "as a 10 song progression from darkness to light. Beginning {{in the pit of}} the darkest valley, and ending at the sunrise of the highest mountain." [...] Fine indicated the album [...] "is a lyrical masterpiece, and by far some of Matt Hammitt’s strongest songwriting to date. I was blown away by the transparency found in these lyrics, and absolutely breath taken by how a song so simple could be so powerful. Musically, this isn’t the upbeat pop/rock style of music Sanctus Real fans have gotten used to over the years, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s <b>what</b> sets <b>this</b> project apart. This is hands down one of the top 10 Christian albums of the year and one longtime fans of the band and beyond will NOT want to miss. I speak for many when I say it has been a privilege to hear how the Hammitt family’s story has unfolded over this last year, and their continuing platform to bring hope to the hurting is sure to leave a legacy we won’t soon forget." ...|$|R
500|$|At {{the time}} of Lyons' first {{interview}} with the gardaí, he was staying at the Salvation Army hostel in Grangegorman. Detective Garda William Mullis and Garda Joseph O'Connor approached {{him as he was}} leaving the hostel. They reported that Lyons said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>this</b> is about". The gardaí brought Lyons to the Bridewell garda station, and interviewed him in the doctor's room. According to the gardaí, at one point during the interview, Lyons burst out crying and said that he had killed the two women. Lyons claimed that he was suffering withdrawal symptoms at the time and that he made the admission so that he could get more drugs. He said that Garda O'Connor had promised that the sooner he confessed, the sooner he would be released from custody and that he [...] "wasn't thinking straight". The gardaí say that he was told that he was not under arrest and that he could leave at any time. As a result of his confession, Dean Lyons was arrested on suspicion of murdering the two women at 13:46 on 26 July 1997.|$|R
5000|$|During a {{performance}} at the Avalon Theater in Salt Lake City, Utah, on September 6, 2006, frontman Dave Elkins made the following statement before the band performed [...] "Mistakes We Knew We Were Making" [...] (transcribed from video previously posted on YouTube):I hope {{you know how much}} fun we’re having up here because of you guys. Well, this next song is a hypothetical story of a couple who falls in love; they’ve decided what they’re looking for and they find it in each other…and it’s very good, it’s very rewarding; but…well, not “but” but alongside of this, or as a result of this, an unborn baby comes into the picture before too long. And {{a lot of people have}} wondered and talked to us at shows, and I’ve seen it discussed on message boards and whatnot, and a lot of people thought this song is a story about an abortion or this song is a story stating us as pro-choice or pro-life, and that’s not necessarily the case here. What we’re looking at is the fact that as a result of this baby entering into the world, they find a love, these individuals, that’s more fulfilling and more rewarding, and more satisfying, than anything they had known up until that point. Cheering <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that it’s important that we understand that love is not always black and white like we’d like for it to be, and sometimes it’s very grey. Sometimes you have to make the difficult decisions. And sometimes you do have to try and fail, and fail and fail a few times before you can actually succeed and get the big picture. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s exactly <b>what</b> <b>this</b> song is really all about. And this song is called “Mistakes We Knew We Were Making.” ...|$|R
