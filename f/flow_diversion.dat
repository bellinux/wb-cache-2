Over one stream reach, autumn baseflow increased nearly three-fold from groundwater contributions; in another, summer flow decreased 50 percent.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{reports the}} results of the {{numerical}} simulation of open channel <b>flow</b> <b>diversions</b> using the two-dimensional (2 D) hydrodynamic model River 2 D. In <b>flow</b> <b>diversions</b> a lateral branch channel splits from the main straight channel diverting part of the incoming water. Diversions are found in lateral intakes and river bifurcations. Two lab experiments were simulated: (1) A 30 o lateral channel that diverts 50 % of the incoming flow and has a width-depth ratio of 2. 8; and (2) a narrow 90 o lateral channel that diverts 81 % of the flow and has a width-depth ratio of only 0. 5. The first diversion has been recently simulated using the 3 D model Delft 3 D; but it had limited success to accurately simulate the length of an eddy inside the branch channel because of limitations with the resolution of its structured mesh. River 2 D, which uses a flexible finite element mesh, was able to reproduce the water depths of the first diversion with a discrepancy of only 1 %; as well as the length of the eddy. River 2 D was also able to reproduce the velocity profiles in the branch channel of the second narrow and deep diversion, which is at the limits of applicability for 2 D shallow water models. Despite the flow being highly 3 D for the presence of a helical flow and eddies, River 2 D performed reasonably well. The results suggested that River 2 D can be promising tool for designing the layout of lateral intakes or the study of alluvial river bifurcations...|$|R

50|$|In blood analysis, {{white blood}} cells, platelets, bacteria, and plasma must be separated. Sieves, weirs, {{inertial}} confinement, and <b>flow</b> <b>diversion</b> devices are some approaches used in preparing blood plasma for cell-free analysis. Sieves can be microfabricated with high-aspect-ratio columns or posts, but are only suitable for low loading to avoid clogging with cells. Weirs are shallow mesa-like sections used to restrict flow to narrow slots between layers without posts. One advantage of using weirs {{is that the}} absence of posts allows more effective recycling of retenate for flow across the filter to wash off clogged cells. The H-filter is a microfluidic device with two inlets and two outlets that takes advantage of laminar flow and diffusion to separate components that diffuse across the interface between two inlet streams. By controlling the flow rate, diffusion distance, and residence time of the fluid in the filter, cells are excluded from the filtrate by virtue of their slower diffusion rate. The H-filter does not clog and can run indefinitely, but analytes are diluted by a factor of two. For cell analysis, cells can be studied intact or after lysis. A lytic buffer stream can be introduced alongside a stream containing cells and by diffusion induces lysis prior to further analysis. Cell analysis is typically done by flow cytometry and can be implemented into microfluidics with lower fluid velocities and lower throughput than their conventional macroscopic counterparts.|$|E

To accurately predict the mean flow and turbulence characteristics of open-channel dividing flows, a hybrid LES-RANS model, which combines the large eddy simulation (LES) model with the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model, is proposed in the present study. The unsteady RANS model was used to simulate the upstream and downstream regions of a main channel, as well as the downstream region of a branch channel. The LES model was used to simulate the channel diversion region, where turbulent flow characteristics are complicated. Isotropic velocity fluctuations were added at the inflow interface of the LES region to trigger the generation of resolved turbulence. A method based on the virtual body force is proposed to impose Reynolds-averaged velocity fields near the outlet of the LES region in order to take downstream flow effects computed by the RANS model into account and dissipate the excessive turbulent fluctuations. This hybrid approach saves computational effort and makes it easier to properly specify inlet and outlet boundary conditions. Comparison between computational results and experimental data indicates that this relatively new modeling approach can accurately predict open-channel T -diversion flows...|$|R

We aimed to assess the influence of <b>flow</b> <b>diversion</b> as a marker of leptomeningeal collateralization on infarct size and penumbral volume. Methods: We assessed consecutive patients presenting within six-hours of ischaemic stroke. Anterior cerebral artery <b>flow</b> <b>diversion,</b> defined as ipsilateral mean velocity of at least 30 % greater than the contralateral artery, was used as the Doppler index of leptomeningeal collateralization. Multivariable regression analysis was performed {{to assess the impact of}} anterior cerebral artery <b>flow</b> <b>diversion,</b> controlling for other important clinical variables. Leptomeningeal collateralization was also graded on computed tomography angiography. Infarct core and penumbral volumes were defined using computed tomography perfusion thresholds of cerebral blood volume and mean transit time. Infarct volume, reperfusion, and vessel status were measured at 24 [*]h using magnetic resonance techniques. Results: Fifty-three patients qualified for analysis. Anterior cerebral artery <b>flow</b> <b>diversion</b> was associated with good collateral flow on computed tomography angiography (P[*]<[*] 0 · 001) and was an independent predictor of admission infarct core volume (P[*]<[*] 0 · 001), and 24 [*]h infarct volume (P[*]<[*] 0 · 001). The likelihood of a favourable outcome (modified Rankin Score 0 – 2) was higher (odds ratio[*]=[*] 27 · 5, P[*]<[*] 0 · 001) in those with <b>flow</b> <b>diversion.</b> Conclusions: Anterior cerebral artery <b>flow</b> <b>diversion</b> indicates effective leptomeningeal collateralization as measured by computed tomography angiography, and independently predicts acute infarct size and 90 -day clinical outcome. <b>Flow</b> <b>diversion</b> appears to provide penumbral perfusion, offering some protection against infarct expansion.

40|$|In <b>diversion</b> <b>flows,</b> {{a portion}} of stream flow which enters the intake is {{diverted}} from upstream of the intake denoted by a surface and is called dividing stream surface (DSS). The amount of flow and sediment discharge entering the intake as well as design of submerged vanes to control sediment depends on determination of dividing stream width. In this study, the experimental tests were carried out at a 30 degree water intake from a trapezoidal section. Three components of velocity data were obtained for different flow conditions. Then numerical SSIIM 2 model was calibrated and verified using tests data. More flow conditions such as the main channel with rectangular section were run using SSIIM 2 model to get enough hydraulic data. From analysis of these datas {{it was found that}} the dividing stream width in different distances from the bed depends directly upon the <b>diversion</b> <b>flow</b> ratio.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the channel changes of the Piave River in the Eastern Alps, Italy, which have {{occurred}} during this century in response to human interventions in the fluvial system. The flow regime and the sediment supply of the river have been considerably altered by hydroelectric dams, <b>flow</b> <b>diversions</b> and gravel mining.

To document these changes, a historical analysis was performed using maps and aerial photographs.

The results indicate that as a consequence of decreases in the flows and sediment supply, remarkable channel changes have occurred in the river during this century, especially during recent decades. The channel has undergone a general narrowing with a decrease in average width to 35 per cent of its initial value, while the braiding index has decreased from about 3 to 15. In several reaches the planform pattern has changed from braided to wandering. The observed trends of channel change suggest that the river has not yet reached a new equilibrium condition and it may, therefore, be predicted that reductions in width and braiding intensity are likely to continue in the immediate future...|$|R

40|$|AbstractStudy regionThe Salmon River is {{the second}} largest {{tributary}} of the Klamath River in northern California, USA. It is a region of steep mountains and diverse conifer forests. Historical land uses including logging, <b>flow</b> <b>diversions,</b> and hydraulic gold mining, have resulted in altered sediment transport regimes, diminished riparian cover and reduced large woody debris. These in turn have altered the thermal regime of the river. Summer stream temperatures commonly exceed salmonid (specifically Oncorhynchus spp.) temperature thresholds. Study focusThermal dynamics of a one-kilometer reach of the Salmon River was quantified using distributed temperature sensing fiber-optics (DTS) and Heat Source modeling. Stream thermal responses to scenarios of air temperature increase and flow reduction were compared with riparian reforestation simulations to estimate benefits of reforestation. New hydrological insightsElevated air temperatures (2 °C, 4 °C, 6 °C) increased mean stream temperature by 0. 23 °C/km, 0. 45 ºC/km and. 68 °C/km respectively. Reforestation lowered temperatures 0. 11 – 0. 12 °C/km for partial and 0. 26 – 0. 27 °C/km for full reforestation. Reduced streamflow raised peak stream temperatures in all simulations. Warming could be mitigated by reforestation, however under severe flow reduction and warming (71. 0 % reduction, 6 °C air temperature), only half of predicted warming would be reduced by the full reforestation scenario.

40|$|Individual stream <b>flow</b> <b>diversions</b> extract {{water from}} streams {{and have the}} {{potential}} to disrupt sediment flux by altering transport capacity and by extracting a portion of the sediment load. The cumulative impact of many diversions over a period of many decades has the potential to cause channel change associated with either sediment deficit or surplus conditions and decreased magnitude of floods. In 2006, we initiated a program of stream flow, sediment transport, and channel morphology measurements in the Cub River watershed in southeastern Idaho where three large diversions have been operating for more than 100 years. Highest flows and highest rates of transport in {{the lower part of the}} watershed occurred earlier in spring than runoff in the upper watershed. During the peak of the snowmelt pulse, flow and sediment transport rates were greatest in the upper watershed and decreased downstream as flow was extracted by diversions. This indicates that the flux of sediment from the upper to the lower watershed is not continuous and that some segments of the stream may have a sediment surplus while other segments may have a sediment deficit. Estimates of total sediment flux for the 2006 runoff suggest that surplus conditions might exist where the channel is affected by only one or two diversions and that deficit conditions might exist further downstream where the channel is affected by a third diversion. The impacts of these patterns of flow and transport on channel morphology are under continued investigation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Hydraulic {{modeling}} of the Koondrook Perricoota Forest (KPF) wetlands adjoining the River Murray in southeastern Australia was performed for historical flooding conditions using MIKE FLOOD {{in three stages}} progressively moving from simple to more complex forms. Validation data sets for model implementation were prepared from remote sensing study, field work, mapping of the inundation area from airborne surveys, reconnaissance surveys and local knowledge. Knowledge of the KPF flood inundation processes was improved in each stage to better formulate more complex model forms. It was considered mandatory to commence simulations with simple model forms using MIKE 11 (quasi- 2 D) and then conduct targeted simulations using MIKE 21 (2 D) and MIKE FLOOD (combined 1 D flow in the runners and 2 D flow in the floodplain). On the basis of results from MIKE 11, MIKE 21 and MIKE FLOOD models, it is concluded that up to flow of about 28000 ML/d, all three hydraulic models provide similar estimates of the inundation area in the range 0 - 10 %. As flow increases further, results from the models tend to differ. Relationships between complexity of the hydraulic models and accuracy of the wetland inundation areas predicted by each model form under a range of hydrological conditions are developed and discussed. Results from complex hydraulic modeling were synthesised into simple and practical tools designed for use by water managers and {{for the application of}} basin-scale hydrological models incorporating the effects of environmental <b>flow</b> <b>diversions</b> in large wetlands...|$|R
