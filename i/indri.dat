5|$|Lemurs {{vary greatly}} in size. They include the {{smallest}} primates {{in the world}} and, until recently, also included some of the largest. They currently {{range in size from}} about 30g (1.1oz) for Madame Berthe's mouse lemur (Microcebus berthae) up to 7–9kg (15–20lb) for the <b>indri</b> (<b>Indri</b> <b>indri)</b> and diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema). When recently extinct species are considered, the size range extended up to that of a gorilla at 160–200kg (350–440lb) for Archaeoindris fontoynonti.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{widespread}} fady about <b>indri</b> and sifakas. They are often protected from hunting and consumption {{because of their}} resemblance to humans and their ancestors, mostly due to their large size and upright or orthograde posture. The resemblance is even stronger for <b>indri,</b> which lack the long tail of most living lemurs. Known locally as babakoto ("Ancestor of Man"), the <b>indri</b> is sometimes seen as the progenitor of the family or clan. There are also stories of an <b>indri</b> that helped a human down from a tree, so they are seen as benefactors. Other lemur fady include the belief that a wife will have ugly children if her husband kills a woolly lemur, or that if a pregnant woman eats a dwarf lemur, her baby will get its beautiful, round eyes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they lack}} a fovea, some diurnal lemurs have a cone-rich, {{although}} less clustered, area centralis. This area centralis {{has a high}} rod-to-cone cell ratio in many diurnal species studied thus far, whereas diurnal anthropoids have no rod cells in their fovea. Once again, this suggests lower visual acuity in lemurs than in anthropoids. Furthermore, the rod-to-cone cell ratio can be variable even among diurnal species. For instance, Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) and the <b>indri</b> (<b>Indri</b> <b>indri)</b> {{have only a few}} large cones scattered along their predominantly rod-dominated retina. The eyes of the ring-tailed lemur contain one cone to five rods. Nocturnal lemurs such as mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs, on the other hand, have retinas made up entirely of rod cells.|$|E
5|$|Family Indriidae {{consists}} of the <b>indri</b> (the largest extant lemur), the woolly lemurs and the sifakas. There are 19extant species.|$|E
5|$|Mouse lemurs (Microcebus), sifakas (Propithecus), and the <b>indri</b> (<b>Indri)</b> {{use their}} toothcombs {{to scoop up}} fruit pulp. Other small lemuriforms, such as fork-marked lemurs (Phaner), the hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus), and galagos (particularly the genera Galago and Euoticus) use their toothcombs to tooth-scrape plant exudates, such as gum and sap. In fork-marked lemurs, the toothcomb is {{specially}} adapted to minimize food trapment since the interdental spaces are greatly reduced. The herbivorous colugos in the genus Cynocephalus may also use their toothcomb for food procurement.|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the genus}} Babakotia derives from the Malagasy common name for the <b>Indri,</b> babakoto, a close {{relative}} of Babakotia. The species name, radofilai, was chosen in honor of French mathematician and expatriate Jean Radofilao, an avid spelunker who mapped the caves where remains of Babakotia radofilai were first found.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} mammals, {{primates}} {{in general are}} very vocal, and lemurs are no exception. Some lemur species have extensive vocal repertoires, including the ring-tailed lemur and ruffed lemurs. Some {{of the most common}} calls among lemurs are predator alarm calls. Lemurs not only respond to alarm calls of their own species, but also alarm calls of other species and those of non-predatory birds. The ring-tailed lemur and a few other species have different calls and reactions to specific types of predators. With mating calls, {{it has been shown that}} mouse lemurs that cannot be discerned visually respond more strongly to the calls of their own species, particularly when exposed to the calls of other mouse lemurs that they would encounter normally within their home range. Lemur calls can also be very loud and carry long distances. Ruffed lemurs use several loud calls that can be heard up to 1km (0.62mi) away on a clear, calm day. The loudest lemur is the <b>indri,</b> whose calls can be heard up to 2km (1.2mi) or more and thus communicate more effectively the territorial boundaries over its 34 to 40hectares (0.13 to 0.15sq mi) home range. Both ruffed lemurs and the <b>indri</b> exhibit contagious calling, where one individual or group starts a loud call and others within the area join in. The song of the <b>indri</b> can last 45seconds to more than 3minutes and tends to coordinate to form a stable duet comparable to that of gibbons.|$|E
5|$|Babakotia is an extinct genus of {{medium-sized}} lemur, or strepsirrhine primate, from Madagascar {{that contains}} a single species, Babakotia radofilai. Together with Palaeopropithecus, Archaeoindris, and Mesopropithecus, it forms the family Palaeopropithecidae, {{commonly known as the}} sloth lemurs. The name Babakotia comes from the Malagasy name for the <b>indri,</b> babakoto, to which it and all other sloth lemurs are closely related. Due to its mix of morphological traits that show intermediate stages between the slow-moving smaller sloth lemurs and the suspensory large sloth lemurs, it has helped determine the relationship between both groups and the closely related and extinct monkey lemurs.|$|E
5|$|Only eight {{species of}} lemur {{are known to}} be seed predators (granivores), but this may be under-reported since most {{observations}} only report fruit consumption and do not investigate whether the seeds are consumed as well. These lemurs include some indriids, such as the diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema), the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), the <b>indri,</b> and the aye-aye. The aye-aye, which specializes in structurally defended resources, can chew through Canarium seeds, which are harder than the seeds that New World monkeys are known to break open. At least 36genera from 23families of plants are targeted by lemur seed predators.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{three-quarters of}} all extant strepsirrhine species are nocturnal, {{sleeping}} in nests made from dead leaves or tree hollows during the day. All of the lorisoids from continental Africa and Asia are nocturnal, a circumstance that minimizes their {{competition with the}} simian primates of the region, which are diurnal. The lemurs of Madagascar, living {{in the absence of}} simians, are more variable in their activity cycles. The aye-aye, mouse lemurs, woolly lemurs, and sportive lemurs are nocturnal, while ring-tailed lemurs and most of their kin, sifakas, and <b>indri</b> are diurnal. Yet {{some or all of the}} brown lemurs (Eulemur) are cathemeral, which means that they may be active during the day or night, depending on factors such as temperature and predation. Many extant strepsirrhines are well adapted for nocturnal activity due to their relatively large eyes; large, movable ears; sensitive tactile hairs; strong sense of smell; and the tapetum lucidum behind the retina. Among the adapiforms, most are considered diurnal, with the exception of Pronycticebus and Godinotia from Middle Eocene Europe, both of which had large orbits that suggest nocturnality.|$|E
25|$|The fauna {{reported}} in the rainforests are found in all the national parks in the country. The reported fauna consists of 45 species of mammals including 13 species of lemurs which are: Diademed sifaka, black-and-white ruffed lemur, <b>indri</b> (<b>Indri</b> <b>indri),</b> hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus trichotis), aye-aye or the local endemic and endangered Lake Alaotra bamboo lemur. The endemic species in the park are: Malagasy primates consisting of five families which are lemurs; seven genera of Rodentia and six genera of Carnivora; 46 species of reptiles including Boa manditra (VU); 25 endemic and near-endemic species of mammals. Of these species, 22 are reported under threatened category, 8 species are under critically endangered list, 9 species are endangered, and 5 species are vulnerable. There are also many endemic species of Chiroptera.|$|E
25|$|Sharma {{was born}} in 1977 to Venod Sharma and Shakti Rani Sharma. His father {{was a member of}} {{parliament}} in the Rajya Sabha in the 1990s, elected on an Indian National Congress ticket. He was later elected to the Haryana legislature. His uncle is the son-in-law of former President of India, Shankar Dayal Sharma. The family owns two sugar mills, at <b>Indri</b> in Haryana, and Patran in Punjab.|$|E
500|$|In the Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve, {{the silky}} sifaka is shares the same {{geographic}} range as the white-fronted brown lemur (Eulemur albifrons) and an all-black population of <b>indri</b> (<b>Indri</b> <b>indri).</b> [...] In Marojejy National Park, it is sympatric with the white-fronted brown lemur. In 2008, [...] the silky sifaka was suggested to be sympatric {{with the red}} ruffed lemur (Varecia rubra) near Maherivaratra and Andaparaty.|$|E
500|$|Until recently, giant lemurs {{existed in}} Madagascar. [...] Although {{they are only}} {{represented}} by subfossil remains, they were modern forms, having adaptations unlike those seen in lemurs today, and are counted {{as part of the}} rich lemur diversity that has evolved in isolation for up to 60million years. [...] All 17 extinct lemurs were larger than the extant forms, including the largest living lemurs, the <b>indri</b> (<b>Indri</b> <b>indri)</b> and diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema), which weigh up to [...] The estimated weights for the subfossil lemurs have varied. [...] Techniques used for these weight estimations include the comparison of skull lengths, tooth size, the head diameter of the femur, and more recently, the area of cortical bone (hard bone) in long bones (such as the humerus). [...] Despite the variations in the size estimates for some species, all subfossil lemurs were larger than living species, weighing [...] or more, and one species may have weighed as much as [...]|$|E
500|$|In general, {{levels of}} agonism (or aggression) tend to {{correlate}} with relative canine height. The ring-tailed lemur has long, sharp upper canine teeth in both sexes, {{and it also}} exhibits high levels of agonism. The <b>Indri,</b> on the other hand, has smaller canines and exhibits lower levels of aggression. When neighboring groups {{of the same species}} defend their territories, the conflict can take the form of ritualized defense. In sifakas, these ritualized combats involve staring, growling, scent-marking, and leaping to occupy certain sections of the tree. The <b>indri</b> defends its home range with ritualized [...] "singing" [...] battles.|$|E
500|$|M.globiceps was {{discovered}} in 1936 and originally classified in its own genus, Neopropithecus. [...] The name globiceps comes from its prominent forehead and derives [...] from the Latin [...] word globus, meaning [...] "ball", and the New Latin suffix -ceps, [...] meaning [...] "head". Like M.pithecoides, {{it was a small}} to medium-sized lemur, weighing approximately [...] and having an intermembral index of 97. [...] It had the most narrow snout and gracile skeleton of the Mesopropithecus species, similar to but smaller than M.pithecoides, making it more like the living sifakas. Its teeth were similar to but larger than those of living sifakas, except for its lower premolars, which were shorter, and the M3 (third upper molar), which was moderately constricted by the cheek and tongue. [...] Its skull length averaged , ranging from [...] It was a mixed feeder, eating fruit, leaves, and a moderate amount of seeds, having a diet {{similar to that of the}} living <b>indri</b> (<b>Indri</b> <b>indri).</b> [...] Although its forelimbs were more like those of living indriids, its hindlimbs and axial skeleton (skull, spine, and ribs) were more specialized for suspension, as in Palaeopropithecus and Babakotia. [...] It was found in the south and west of Madagascar. [...] Three samples of its subfossil remains have been radiocarbon dated, yielding dates of 354–60 BCE, 58–247 CE, and 245–429 CE.|$|E
500|$|All four genera of sloth lemurs {{are known}} to be a sister taxon (close relatives) of family Indriidae, which {{includes}} the <b>indri</b> (<b>Indri),</b> sifakas (Propithecus), and woolly lemurs (Avahi). [...] This relationship is supported by data from morphological, developmental, and molecular research. [...] Another member of this clade (related group) is the family of monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae). [...] Dental features, such as the morphology of their molar teeth and the modified number of teeth in their toothcomb (a specialized grooming structure found in lemuriforms), have long suggested a relationship. [...] However, other anatomical and developmental traits suggested that monkey lemurs might be more closely related to family Lemuridae, which include five genera of lemur, including the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta). [...] Molecular analysis has shown strong support for the former, placing the monkey lemurs in a clade with the sloth lemurs and indriids.|$|E
500|$|There {{are also}} {{noticeable}} differences in dental morphology and tooth topography between lemurs. <b>Indri,</b> for instance, have teeth that are perfectly adapted for shearing leaves and crushing seeds. In the toothcomb of most lemurs, the bottom incisors and canine teeth are procumbent (face forward rather than up) and finely spaced, thus providing {{a tool for}} either grooming or feeding. For instance, <b>indri</b> use their toothcomb not only for grooming, but also to pry out the large seeds from the tough epicarp of Beilschmiedia fruits, while fork-marked lemurs use their relatively long toothcomb to cut through tree bark to induce the flow of tree sap. The toothcomb is kept clean by the sublingua or [...] "under-tongue", a specialized structure that acts like a toothbrush to remove hair and other debris. The sublingua extends below {{the tip of the}} tongue and is tipped with keratinized, serrated points that rake between the front teeth.|$|E
500|$|The {{generic name}} Archaeoindris, meaning [...] "ancient indri-like lemur", {{is derived from}} the Greek word ἀρχαῖος (archaios, or [...] "ancient") and indris, a common {{variation}} of the generic name <b>Indri.</b> [...] The species name, fontoynontii (sometimes spelled fontoynonti), was selected in honor of Antoine Maurice Fontoynont, the president of the Académie Malgache (Malagasy Academy) at the time. [...] Fontoynont was reported to have been supervising the excavation when it was discovered.|$|E
500|$|Within the {{protected}} regions {{it is known}} to inhabit, the ring-tailed lemur is sympatric (shares its range) {{with as many as}} 24 species of lemur, covering every living genus except Allocebus, <b>Indri,</b> and Varecia. [...] Historically, the species used to be sympatric with the critically endangered southern black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata editorum), which was once found at Andringitra National Park; however, no sightings of the ruffed lemur have been reported in recent years.|$|E
500|$|All sloth lemurs have {{relatively}} robust skulls {{compared to the}} indriids, yet despite shared cranial features with the larger sloth lemurs, its skull still resembles that of an <b>indri.</b> The cranial traits shared with the other sloth lemurs include relatively small orbits, robust zygomatic arches, and a mostly rectangular hard palate. The small orbits taken into consideration with the relative size of the optic canal suggest that Babakotia had low visual acuity, which is typical for lemurs. The skull length averages [...]|$|E
500|$|All lemurs {{belong to}} the {{suborder}} Strepsirrhini within the order Primates. The 101extant species and subspecies are divided among 5 families and 15 genera. They range in weight from [...] (Madame Berthe's mouse lemur) {{to as much as}} [...] (<b>indri).</b> Most are highly arboreal and activity patterns range widely from nocturnal to diurnal to cathemeral. Having diversified over millions of years to fill every ecological niche, diets also vary widely, though fruit, leaves, and insects make up the majority of the diet for most species.|$|E
500|$|Fady {{have served}} to protect certain {{wildlife}} in the Sihanaka homeland. [...] The aye-aye {{is the subject}} of numerous fady and folk tales among the Sihanaka. It was traditionally believed that a person who fell asleep in the forest might be brought a pillow by an aye-aye. If the pillow was for one's head, he or she would become rich, but if it was for the feet, that person would be subject to evil sorcery. Similarly, the <b>indri</b> is considered sacred and may not be hunted, killed or eaten.|$|E
500|$|Diurnal lemurs {{are visible}} during the day, so many live in groups, where the {{increased}} number of eyes and ears helps aid in predator detection. Diurnal lemurs use and respond to alarm calls, even those of other lemur species and non-predatory birds. The ring-tailed lemur has different calls and reactions to different classes of predators, such as predatory birds, mammals, or snakes. Some lemurs, such as the <b>indri,</b> use crypsis to camouflage themselves. They are often heard but difficult {{to see in the}} trees due to the dappled light, earning them the reputation of being [...] "ghosts of the forest".|$|E
500|$|Subfossil {{sites in}} Madagascar have yielded {{the remains of}} more than just extinct lemurs. [...] Extant lemur remains have also been found, and {{radiocarbon}} dating has demonstrated that both types of lemur lived at the same time. [...] Furthermore, in some cases living species are locally extinct for {{the area in which}} their subfossil remains were found. [...] Because subfossil sites are found across most of the island, with the most notable exception being the eastern rainforest, both paleocommunity composition and paleodistributions can be determined. Geographic ranges have contracted for numerous species, including the <b>indri,</b> greater bamboo lemur, and ruffed lemurs. [...] For instance, subfossil remains of the <b>indri</b> have been found in marsh deposits near Ampasambazimba in the Central Highlands and in other deposits in both central and northern Madagascar, demonstrating a much larger range than the small region on the east coast that it currently occupies. Even the greater bamboo lemur, a critically endangered species restricted to {{a small portion of the}} south-central eastern rainforest, has undergone significant range contraction since the mid-Holocene, with subfossil remains from Ankarana Massif in the far north of Madagascar dating to 2565 BCE ± 70 years. [...] Combined with finds from other subfossil sites, data suggests that it used to range across the northern, northwestern, central, and eastern parts of the island. It is unclear whether these locations were wetter in the past or whether distinct subpopulations or subspecies occupied the drier forests, much like modern diversity of sifakas.|$|E
500|$|Archaeoindris fontoynontii is an extinct giant lemur and {{the largest}} primate known to have evolved on Madagascar, {{comparable}} in size to a male gorilla. [...] It belonged to a family of extinct lemurs known as [...] "sloth lemurs" [...] (Palaeopropithecidae), and because of its extremely large size, it {{has been compared to}} the ground sloths that once roamed North and South America. [...] It was most closely related to Palaeopropithecus, the second largest type of sloth lemur. [...] Along with the other sloth lemurs, Archaeoindris was related to the living <b>indri,</b> sifakas, and woolly lemurs, as well as the recently extinct monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae). [...] The genus, Archaeoindris, translates to [...] "ancient indri-like lemur", even though it probably became extinct recently, around 350 BCE.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, a {{research}} {{team led by}} David Burney and Ramilisonina performed interviews in and around Belo sur Mer, including Ambararata and Antsira, to find subfossil megafaunal sites used early in the century by other paleontologists. [...] During carefully controlled interviews, the team recorded stories of recent sightings of dwarf hippos (called kilopilopitsofy) and of a large lemur-like creature known as kidoky; {{a report of the}} interviews was published in 1998 with encouragement from primatologist Alison Jolly and anthropologist Laurie Godfrey. [...] In one interview, an 85-year-old man named Jean Noelson Pascou recounted seeing the rare kidoky up close in 1952. [...] Pascou said that the animal looks similar to a sifaka, but had a human-like face, and was [...] "the size of a seven-year-old girl". It had dark fur and a discernible white spot both on the forehead and below the mouth. [...] According to Pascou, it was a shy animal that fled on the ground instead of in the trees. [...] Burney interpreted the old man as saying that it moved in [...] "a series of leaps", but Godfrey later claimed that [...] "a series of bounds" [...] was a better translation — a description that would closely match the foot anatomy of monkey lemurs, such as Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur. [...] Pascou could also imitate its call, a long single [...] "whoop", and said that kidoky would come closer and continue calling if he imitated the call correctly. [...] The call Pascou imitated was comparable to that of a short call for an <b>indri,</b> which lives {{on the other side of}} Madagascar. [...] When shown a picture of an <b>indri,</b> Pascou said kidoky did not look like that, and that it had a rounder face, more similar to a sifaka. [...] Pascou also speculated that kidoky could stand on two legs and that it was a solitary animal.|$|E
500|$|Four pocket field guides {{have also}} been {{published}} by CI, intended strictly to help people identify lemurs in the field by providing over 100 species illustrations. [...] All illustrations, including the detailed cover art, were drawn by Nash. [...] Checklists for their respective lemur species are included with these guides, along with thumbnail range maps for each species. [...] The four pocket guides include two editions of Lemurs of Madagascar Pocket Identification Guide (out of print), Nocturnal Lemurs, and Diurnal and Cathemeral Lemurs. [...] The Nocturnal Lemurs booklet contains 65species from eight genera. [...] Diurnal and Cathemeral Lemurs hosts 34species and subspecies from seven genera, along with illustrations to show male and female fur color differences in the genus Eulemur and color morphs for the <b>indri</b> and ruffed lemur species. [...] A fifth and sixth pocket field guides are planned following {{the publication of the}} third edition of the field guide.|$|E
500|$|Olfaction is {{particularly}} important to lemurs, except for the <b>indri,</b> which lacks most common lemur scent glands and has a greatly reduced olfactory region in the brain. Olfaction can communicate information about age, sex, reproductive status, as well as demarcate the boundaries of a territory. It is most useful for communication between animals that rarely encounter each other. Small, nocturnal lemurs mark their territories with urine, while the larger, diurnal species use scent glands located on various parts of their anatomy. The ring-tailed lemur engages in [...] "stink fights" [...] by rubbing its tail across scent glands on its wrists, and then flicking its tail at other male opponents. Some lemurs defecate in specific areas, otherwise known as latrine behavior. Although many animals exhibit this behavior, it is a rare trait among primates. Latrine behavior can represent territorial marking and aid in interspecies signaling.|$|E
500|$|Ranging {{in weight}} from the [...] mouse lemur to the [...] <b>indri,</b> lemurs share many common, basal primate traits, such as {{divergent}} digits {{on their hands}} and feet and nails instead of claws (in most species). However, their brain-to-body size ratio is smaller than that of anthropoid primates, and among many other traits they share with other strepsirrhine primates, they have a [...] "wet nose" [...] (rhinarium). Lemurs are generally the most social of the strepsirrhine primates and communicate more with scents and vocalizations than with visual signals. Many lemur adaptations are in response to Madagascar's highly seasonal environment. Lemurs have relatively low basal metabolic rates and may exhibit seasonal breeding, dormancy (such as hibernation or torpor), or female social dominance. Most eat a wide variety of fruits and leaves, while some are specialists. Although many share similar diets, different species of lemur share the same forests by differentiating niches.|$|E
500|$|Lemurs are strepsirrhine primates, {{all species}} {{of which are}} endemic to Madagascar. They include the {{smallest}} primate in the world, Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, which weighs , and range up {{to the size of}} the <b>indri,</b> which can weigh as much as [...] However, recently extinct species grew much larger. As of 2010, five families, 15genera, and 101species and subspecies of lemur were formally recognized. Of the 101species and subspecies, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classified eight as Critically Endangered, 18as Endangered, 15as Vulnerable, four as Near Threatened, eight as Least Concern and 41as Data Deficient; seven were yet to be evaluated. From 2000 through 2008, 39new species were described and nine other taxa resurrected. By 2014, the number of species and subspecies recognized had increased to 105; of these, the IUCN classified 24as Critically Endangered, 49as Endangered, 20as Vulnerable, three as Near Threatened, three as Least Concern and four as Data Deficient; two were yet to be evaluated.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the book, including the chapter [...] "The Living Lemurs" [...] and separate sections on each taxonomic group of lemur, providing detailed accounts of all lemur species known up until the time of publication, from the tiny mouse lemurs to the large <b>indri</b> and diademed sifaka. [...] In {{the first and second}} editions, the chapter [...] "The Living Lemurs" [...] is broken first into sections on families, and then into species clumped together by genus. [...] In the third edition, each family is assigned its own chapter number, separate from [...] "The Living Lemurs" [...] chapter, yet the order and layout are the same. [...] In the second and third editions, all pages within each family section are assigned a colored tab to match those in the quick visual reference inside the covers. Each species subsection has a distribution map, an illustration or photo (if available), a list of common names in multiple languages (including Malagasy), and species information broken into five sections: [...] "Identification", [...] "Geographic Range", [...] "Natural History", [...] "Conservation Status", and [...] "Where to See It".|$|E
500|$|Determining the {{phylogeny}} of subfossil lemurs {{has been}} problematic because studies of morphology, developmental biology, and molecular phylogenetics have sometimes yielded conflicting results. All studies {{agree that the}} family Daubentoniidae (including the giant aye-aye) diverged first from the other lemurs at least 60million years ago. The relationship between the remaining families has been less clear. [...] Morphological, developmental, and molecular studies have offered support for lumping the four sloth lemur genera of the family Palaeopropithecidae with the family Indriidae (including the <b>indri,</b> sifakas, and woolly lemurs). [...] The placement of family Megaladapidae has been more controversial, with similarities in teeth and skull features suggesting {{a close relationship with}} family Lepilemuridae (sportive lemurs). [...] Molecular data, instead, indicate a closer relationship to family Lemuridae. [...] Likewise, a relationship between family Archaeolemuridae and family Lemuridae has been suggested, based on morphological and developmental traits, yet molar morphology, the number of teeth in the specialized toothcomb, and molecular analysis support a closer relationship with the indriid–sloth lemur clade. Other subfossil lemurs, including the giant aye-aye and Pachylemur, are more easily placed due to strong similarities with existing lemurs (the aye-aye and ruffed lemurs, respectively).|$|E
500|$|Lemurs {{are social}} {{and live in}} groups that usually include fewer than 15individuals. Observed social {{organization}} patterns include [...] "solitary but social", [...] "fission-fusion", [...] "pair bonds", and [...] "multi-male group". Nocturnal lemurs are mostly solitary but social, foraging alone at night but often nesting in groups during the day. The degree of socialization varies by species, gender, location, and season. In many nocturnal species, for instance, the females, along with their young, will share nests with other females and possibly one male, whose larger home range happens to overlap one or more female nesting groups. In sportive lemurs and fork-marked lemurs, one or two females may share a home range, possibly with a male. In addition to sharing nests, they will also interact vocally or physically with their range-mate while they forage at night. Diurnal lemurs exhibit many of the social systems seen in monkeys and apes, living in relatively permanent and cohesive social groups. Multi-male groups are the most common, {{just as they are}} in most anthropoid primates. True lemurs utilize this social system, often living in groups of ten or less. Ruffed lemurs have been shown to live in fission-fusion societies, and <b>Indri</b> forms pair bonds.|$|E
500|$|A new genus of sloth lemur, Babakotia, was {{discovered}} in 1986 by {{a team led by}} Elwyn L. Simons of Duke University in karst caves on the Ankarana Massif in northern Madagascar. Along with Babakotia, a new species of Mesopropithecus, M. dolichobrachion, was also discovered, but not formally described until 1995. The same team has also helped promote new ideas about sloth lemur adaptations and the relationships among the four genera. [...] They have also provided evidence that living species, such as the <b>indri</b> and the greater gamboo lemur, have lost much of their original range. [...] In 2009, a new species of large sloth lemur, called Palaeopropithecus kelyus, was described from northwestern Madagascar by a Franco-Madagascan team. [...] The new species was found to be smaller than the two previously known species from the genus, and its diet reportedly consisted of more hard-textured food. [...] The resurgence in subfossil lemur work has also sparked new interest in Madagascar's small mammals, which have also been found at the subfossil sites. [...] This has led to new ideas about the origins, diversity, and distribution of these animals.|$|E
