Costs {{associated with these}} donations include pain and risk of infection.

In a survey, both donors and non-donors expressed perceptions of the health, generosity, and ability of blood donors to operate in stressful situations.|$|E
5|$|Sociology {{of leisure}} {{is a fairly}} recent {{subfield}} of sociology, compared to more traditional subfields such as sociology of work, sociology of the family, and sociology of education: it saw most of its development {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. Until then, leisure had often been seen as a relatively unimportant, minor feature of society. Leisure is now recognized as a major social institution, deserving of serious sociological inquiry, particularly <b>in</b> <b>Western</b> <b>societies.</b>|$|E

5|$|Costly {{signalling}} can {{be applied}} to situations involving physical strain and risk of physical injury or death. Research on physical risk taking is important because information regarding why people, especially young men, take part in high risk activities can help in the development of prevention programs. Reckless driving is a lethal problem among young men <b>in</b> <b>western</b> <b>societies.</b> A male who takes a physical risk is sending the message that he has enough strength and skill to survive extremely dangerous activities. This signal is directed at peers and potential mates.|$|E

Their docile nature; friendly, even affectionate responsiveness to handling and feeding; {{and the relative}} ease of caring for them, continue to make guinea pigs a popular pet. Organizations devoted to competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and many specialized breeds of guinea pig, with varying coat colors and compositions, are cultivated by breeders.|$|E
5|$|Globally, acne affects {{approximately}} 650million people, {{or about}} 9.4% of the population, as of 2010. It affects nearly 90% of people <b>in</b> <b>Western</b> <b>societies</b> during their teenage years, but can occur before adolescence and may persist into adulthood. While acne that first develops {{between the ages}} of 21 and 25 is uncommon, it affects 54% of women and 40% of men older than 25years of age, and has a lifetime prevalence of 85%. About 20% of those affected have moderate or severe cases. It is slightly more common in females than males (9.8% versus 9.0%). In those over 40years old, 1% of males and 5% of females still have problems.|$|E

5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face <b>in</b> <b>Western</b> <b>societies</b> that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E

40|$|Research on {{immigration}} and cultural adaptation {{has only recently}} {{caught the attention of}} researchers, especially in the field of psychology, and this area remains relatively unexplored in New Zealand. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore how Iraqi migrants talk about, and make sense of Arab culture and the preservation of Arab culture <b>in</b> <b>Western</b> <b>society.</b> Arabs face various challenges when resettling <b>in</b> <b>Western</b> <b>society,</b> a society which is considerably different from Arab society. Arab mothers are concerned that their children will take onboard Western values and customs, which go against Arab culture, thus risk blackening the family's face. Arab mothers in particular expressed their concern for their daughters who are raised <b>in</b> <b>Western</b> <b>society,</b> which encourages behaviours that are considered inappropriate according to Arab culture. Concern for daughters stem from the fact that female Arabs are considered the honour and reputation of Arab family. The methodology used is that of qualitative discourse analysis. Ten semi-structured interviews with five Iraqi mothers, and their daughters were carried out. The participants were interviewed about the processes of cultural adaptation and preservation <b>in</b> <b>Western</b> <b>society.</b> Their talk was analysed in relation to how the participants constructed, the other, Arab culture, the bint - the unmarried virgin daughter, and the Arab mother. Most important, on the basis of these four issues we were able to examine the practice of intergenerational cultural preservation. Findings exemplified that Arab mothers <b>in</b> <b>Western</b> <b>society</b> seek to preserve Arab culture and beliefs, whereas Arab daughters who are raised <b>in</b> <b>Western</b> <b>society</b> want cultural conservation, which will free them from cultural and parental control. In general, Arab culture and identity is defined in terms of difference and exclusion from dominant sectors of <b>Western</b> <b>society.</b> Their sense of difference and exclusion, in turn, informs many of their social behaviours and activities. Although the participants constructed a distinctive identity for themselves <b>in</b> relation to <b>Western</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> New Zealand, they were also keen to some extent to establish membership to that society despite their sense of difference and exclusion...|$|R

The European Union and the United Nations claim to be stopping these types of human rights violations, save for a few violations committed by some western governments (e.g. the CIA's extraordinary rendition programme). The PRC holds the opinion, though, that many alleged negatives about democratic society are a direct result of an excess of individual freedom, saying that too much freedom is dangerous.|$|E

25|$|The reminiscence bump {{has been}} studied cross-culturally and has been {{observed}} in various cultural backgrounds and experiences.

The age of occurrence of the reminiscence bump is culturally influenced and reflects the age at which a culture identifies individuals as adults. <b>In</b> <b>Western</b> <b>societies</b> the reminiscence bump corresponds with adolescence and early adulthood, approximately from the ages of 10 to 30.
