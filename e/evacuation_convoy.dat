She provided gunfire support to Soviet forces defending Odessa and escorted convoys bringing the 157th Rifle Division into Odessa during the month of September 1941. She also transported one battalion of the 3rd Marine Regiment from Sevastopol in a successful amphibious assault behind Romanian lines to destroy Romanian coastal batteries near Fontanka and Dofinovka. She escorted convoys from 3—6 October that evacuated the 157th Rifle Division from Odessa to Sevastopol and escorted the final <b>evacuation</b> <b>convoy</b> during the night of 15–16 October. During the Siege of Sevastopol she provided gunfire support and evacuated cut-off troops from elsewhere in the Crimea into Sevastopol and brought in reinforcements from Caucasian ports.

25|$|Leningrad was {{commissioned}} into the Baltic Fleet in December 1936, but one source claims {{that she was}} still being worked on until July 1938. Minsk {{was commissioned}} in early 1939. She sailed to Tallinn on 22 October 1940 when the Soviet Union began to occupy Estonia. After the Winter War broke out both ships bombarded Finnish coastal defense positions on Saarenpää Island, part of the Beryozovye Islands on 10 December 1939 and again on 30 December–3 January 1940. In addition Minsk bombarded them on 18–19 December as well. The beginning of Operation Barbarossa found Leningrad and Minsk in Tallinn and they were ordered to cover mine-laying operations {{at the entrance to the}} Gulf of Finland between Hanko and Osmussaar on 23 June. Both ships bombarded German positions surrounding Tallinn 23–27 August and participated in the evacuation of Tallinn from Tallinn to Leningrad at the end of August 1941. Minsk was sunk in Kronstadt harbor by Junkers Ju 87 dive-bombers of StG 2 on 23 September. She was later salvaged and recommissioned on 22 June 1943. Leningrad was part of the third <b>evacuation</b> <b>convoy</b> from Hanko to Leningrad from 9–12 December, but was forced to turn back by damage from nearby mine explosions. For most of the rest of the war both destroyers were blockaded in Leningrad and Kronstadt by Axis minefields and could only provide gunfire support for the defenders during the Siege of Leningrad.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{transport}} network on shore was of relatively limited utility, the main task of Finnish naval forces {{had been to}} protect {{the transport}}ation of materials over the lake. When the Soviets began their 1944 offensive in the Karelian Isthmus, the Finns, anticipating another offensive closer to Onega, had already begun evacuating the region. From 16 through 27 June, Finnish naval forces successfully protected the <b>evacuation</b> <b>convoys,</b> after which the ships were disarmed and scuttled. Only VTV-1 was spared, being transported by rail to the Baltic. Soviet naval forces started their attacks on Onega on 26 June, {{and by the time}} they landed troops at Petrozavodsk on 28 June, the Finns had already left the area.|$|R
5000|$|In 1942, the Japanese invaded East and Southeast Asia, {{including}} Burma, {{in hopes}} of creating an Empire for itself throughout Asia. Because of their European connections and appearance and fearful of Japanese rule, most Anglo-Burmans began making frantic preparations {{to leave the country}} for safety in India alongside the British. A vast majority of Anglo-Burmans made their way out of Burma by their own means, some by sea and others by air. Many were employed by government departments or were married to government employees and were able to flee on official <b>evacuation</b> <b>convoys.</b> Others stayed at their posts and ran the telegraphs and phone operations, railways and other infrastructure systems {{until it was too late}} to escape. Sadly, of those who were left behind, many opted to walk through the jungles to safety in India.

2500|$|The U.S. {{embassy in}} Georgia {{organized}} an <b>evacuation</b> <b>convoy</b> {{to leave for}} Yerevan on August 10 and scheduled a second one for August 11 and invited American citizens {{in the region to}} join them, while it also issued a travel warning. With coordination from embassy employees in Yerevan and the United States Marine embassy guards, the convoy's progress was followed and documented along their travel route. Embassy personnel in Yerevan made lodging arrangements for the evacuated family members and United States citizens coming from Georgia. The United States Marine embassy guards who stayed in Tbilisi along with the embassy's essential staff were in constant communication with the Marines in Yerevan, and the two posts served as a communications hub for embassy personnel in Tbilisi to talk to their family members. The two embassy posts were able to maintain constant communication and relay up-to-date information regarding the safety and well-being of all embassy personnel that remained behind to secure the embassy and vital classified material.|$|E

500|$|The plan works {{but it is}} pyrrhic victory, as the GTVA {{loses the}} Colossus, their only match for Shivan juggernauts, in a diversionary {{engagement}} {{at the other end}} of the Capella system.

The Admiral concludes by saying that the Alliance now has the means to recreate the Ancient subspace gate, implying that there's a chance the node to Earth can be restored and that this conflict didn't bring only sorrow, before signing off.|$|R

Between February and July 1942 she bombarded German troops on multiple times and brought in reinforcements and supplies for Sevastopol, evacuating wounded and refugees as she returned to port. She bombarded Axis positions near Feodosiya on 2–3 August and provided fire support for the defenders of Novorossiysk on 1–4 September. Between 8–11 September she ferried the 137th and 145th Rifle Regiments along with the 3rd Naval Rifle Brigade from Poti to Tuapse and Gelendzhik and a month later she transported 12,600 men of the 8th, 9th and 10th Guards Infantry Brigades from Poti to Tuapse to reinforce the defenses there between 20 and 23 October.
