5|$|The Southern Railway {{operating}} department undertook trials to improve fleet efficiency. When built, Eastbourne-based No. A629 was fitted with an experimental pulverised <b>fuel</b> <b>burner</b> of German design; {{the experiment was}} terminated when a minor explosion {{was caused by the}} powdered coal coming into contact with sparks thrown from the blastpipe. The experiment also proved that pulverised coal was a false economy, as much of the fine dust was sucked through the chimney without combustion taking place. The locomotive was returned to normal coal burning in 1935. In 1947 the class became a test-bed for a government-backed scheme regarding fuelling arrangements in anticipation of a coal shortage. Two of the class, Nos. 1625 and 1797, were converted to oil burning, with more set to follow suit; but the project was abandoned and the two oil burners were reverted to coal-firing before this could take place.|$|E
2500|$|Since the Stirling {{engine is}} a closed cycle, it {{contains}} a fixed mass of gas called the [...] "working fluid", most commonly air, hydrogen or helium. In normal operation the engine is sealed and no gas enters or leaves the engine. No valves are required, unlike other types of piston engines. The Stirling engine, like most heat engines, cycles through four main processes: cooling, compression, heating and expansion. This is accomplished by moving the gas {{back and forth between}} hot and cold heat exchangers, often with a regenerator between the heater and cooler. The hot heat exchanger is in thermal contact with an external heat source, such as a <b>fuel</b> <b>burner,</b> and the cold heat exchanger is in thermal contact with an external heat sink, such as air fins. A change in gas temperature causes a corresponding change in gas pressure, while the motion of the piston causes the gas to be alternately expanded and compressed.|$|E

50|$|The SP8 is Mamod's first beam engine, {{introduced}} in 2013. It {{uses the same}} double acting piston valve cylinder as used in other recent models, which is mounted vertically under {{one end of the}} beam, connected to it using a simulated Watts linkage. The crankshaft and flywheel are mounted under the other end. The valve gear is controlled via a second smaller beam. The SP8 is offered with optional gas or solid <b>fuel</b> <b>burner.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{tubes are}} single {{diagonal}} curves, reaching vertically from a lower ring of tube joints to an upper ring. There are fewer tubes, and less exposed surface to each tube, {{than for the}} previous designs. As the tubes are also closer to vertical, circulation within them is vigorous, they have greater evaporative power per area, and a suitably fired boiler with a liquid <b>fuel</b> <b>burner</b> may still generate a large volume of steam.|$|E
50|$|After the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property {{was signed}} in Paris in March 1883, Sweden {{modified}} its patent law in 1884 and joined the international convention on June 26, 1885. Serial numbers and annual fees were introduced in this law, and administration was moved from the Board of Trade to a new Royal Patent Office (Kongl. Patentbyrån). Swedish Patent No. 1 was published on June 5, 1885, valid since January 2, 1885, assigned to E.C. Burgess of London, England, for a liquid <b>fuel</b> <b>burner.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{reference}} {{design of}} the ALh~R is a 471 MtVt modular breeder reactor. The reference fuel for this core is a metallic alloy of ~J, P~l, and Zr. In this study, the design of an alternative oxide fueled ALNIR is presented and compared with the reference design. Fuel utilization in the oxicle fuelecl core {{is not as good}} as in the reference ALMR, and a higher fissile inventory is therefore required. Also, an oxicle <b>fueled</b> <b>burner</b> is developed based on the alternative oxide fuelecl design ancl compared with a metallic fuelecl burner basecl on the reference design. This stllcly shows that when an oxide <b>fueled</b> <b>burner</b> is optimized within the same geometrical configuration and within the same limits and constraints as an optimal clesiguecl metallic fw elecl <b>burner,</b> the oxide <b>fueled</b> <b>burner</b> lmight perform as well as or even better than the metallic fuelecl burner...|$|R

50|$|A {{steam engine}} is an {{external}} combustion engine (ECE: the fuel is combusted {{away from the}} engine), {{as opposed to an}} internal combustion engine (ICE: the fuel is combusted within the engine). While gasoline-powered ICE cars have an operational thermal efficiency of 15% to 30%, early automotive steam units were capable of only about half this efficiency. A significant benefit of the ECE is that the <b>fuel</b> <b>burner</b> can be configured for very low emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and unburned carbon in the exhaust, thus avoiding pollution.|$|E
5000|$|Perreaux {{experimented with}} a small steam engine in a bicycle frame, {{contributing}} to {{the invention of the}} first motorcycle. Perreaux patented this design under number 83,691 on 16 March 1869 (and continued to improve his invention until 1885). The design featured a brass-plated single-cylinder steam engine with an alcohol <b>fuel</b> <b>burner</b> under the saddle of a French-made Michaux velocipede bicycle. Drive was by twin belts, and it was capable of about 9 mph. [...] The original machine is on display in the Musée de l’Île-de-France at the Château de Sceaux.|$|E
50|$|The SP3 {{was based}} on the MEC1 Meccano engine, which first {{appeared}} in 1965. It was basically the same except for a solid <b>fuel</b> <b>burner,</b> sight glass, whistle instead of the steam dome, plastic gears instead of metal ones on the crank shaft for driving Meccano models. It carried two makers marks — a Mamod and a Meccano type scalloped edge decal. The baseplate was silver painted. The boiler was a standard Mamod drawn type tube as used on the SP2, SP4 and SR1a. It could drive the whole series of workshop tools. The exhaust was a simple open port in the engine frame as per the MEC1.|$|E

50|$|The 'A' {{power station}} had an {{installed}} capacity of 120 MW. It consisted of four 30 MW two-cylinder turbines/alternators manufactured by Metropolitan-Vickers and Associated Electrical Industries (AEI). No.3 M/C was installed {{with the first}} direct water-cooled alternator. Steam was supplied from four Yarrow & Co. coal-fired boilers with tangentially fired tilting pulverized <b>fuel</b> <b>burners,</b> with 3no type LM13 table mills made by ICL of Derby.|$|R
30|$|Bioliquids may be {{transformed}} {{for use in}} engines or used directly as <b>fuels</b> in <b>burners.</b> When used as <b>fuels</b> in <b>burners,</b> certain advantages are evident such as (a) requiring no specific transformation processes, thereby enabling them to be obtained relatively cheaply; (b) less rigorous specifications when used in burners than when used in engines; and (c) {{a wider range of}} technologies linked to burners than to heat engines. In addition, burners have a wider range of regulation vis-à-vis fuel than heat engines [4].|$|R
50|$|Recuperators {{are often}} used in {{association}} with the burner portion of a heat engine, to increase the overall efficiency. For example, in a gas turbine engine, air is compressed, mixed with fuel, which is then burned and used to drive a turbine. The recuperator transfers some of the waste heat in the exhaust to the compressed air, thus preheating it before entering the <b>fuel</b> <b>burner</b> stage. Since the gases have been pre-heated, less fuel is needed to heat the gases up to the turbine inlet temperature. By recovering some of the energy usually lost as waste heat, the recuperator can make a heat engine or gas turbine significantly more efficient.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were two}} power {{versions}} of this engine: Standard Power [...] at 3500 rpm and a maximum torque of 320 Nm at 2000 rpm, High Power [...] at 3500 rpm and a maximum torque of 360 Nm at 2000 rpm. Both versions come with a DPF system standard, which traps soot in a coated ceramic filter. As soon as the filter's storage capacity is exhausted, exhaust gas temperature is raised {{for a short period}} (using only diesel pre and post-injection techniques, not any <b>fuel</b> <b>burner</b> additive) and the particles burn off. As a result, the RF 2005 engines emit 80 percent less particulate matter than required by Euro Stage IV standards.Engines were mounted in (in order of appearance): ...|$|E
50|$|The SP1 {{was based}} on the Mamod Minor 1 which it {{replaced}} and which had been in production since 1939. It had the same boiler, similar engine unit and flywheel to the non-crankdisc types. The main differences were that it had a new black die-cast chimney and a narrow solid <b>fuel</b> <b>burner</b> design to take one tablet broken in half. This was also the only SP engine to feature a water plug as the boiler was too small to fit the standard Mamod water sight glass. The firebox remained the same as the older Minor 1. Some were built with the old Mamod Minor 1 boiler. The exhaust was a simple open port as on the Minor 2 and MEC1 engines. These engines with limited power and torque could drive at least 1 or 2 miniature tools.The SP1 was discontinued in 1985 after 27,500 had been produced.|$|E

5000|$|Wall-flow diesel {{particulate}} filters usually remove 85% {{or more of}} the soot, {{and under}} certain conditions can attain soot removal efficiencies approaching 100%. Some filters are single-use, intended for disposal and replacement once full of accumulated ash. Others are designed to burn off the accumulated particulate either passively {{through the use of a}} catalyst or by active means such as a <b>fuel</b> <b>burner</b> which heats the filter to soot combustion temperatures. This is accomplished by engine programming to run (when the filter is full) in a manner that elevates exhaust temperature, in conjunction with an extra fuel injector in the exhaust stream that injects fuel to react with a catalyst element to burn off accumulated soot in the DPF filter, or through other methods. This is known as [...] "filter regeneration". Cleaning is also required as part of periodic maintenance, and it must be done carefully to avoid damaging the filter. Failure of fuel injectors or turbochargers resulting in contamination of the filter with raw diesel or engine oil can also necessitate cleaning. The regeneration process occurs at road speeds higher than can generally be attained on city streets; vehicles driven exclusively at low speeds in urban traffic can require periodic trips at higher speeds to clean out the DPF. If the driver ignores the warning light and waits too long to operate the vehicle above 40 mph, the DPF may not regenerate properly, and continued operation past that point may spoil the DPF completely so it must be replaced. Some newer diesel engines, namely those installed in combination vehicles, can also perform what is called a Parked Regeneration, where the engine increases RPM to around 1400 while parked, to increase the temperature of the exhaust.|$|E

50|$|This is a {{model of}} a {{two-seater}} roadster style car, possibly based on the look and style of a Mercer Raceabout from the early 20th century. The model first appeared in late 1976 and was designed by Steve Malins with input from George Morris. The first versions were finished in red and white with black upholstery (still available), newer versions have recently appeared in green/brass or burgundy/brass finishes. A silver 4-seater limousine based on the Roadster is also a popular model appearing in the 1980s. The boiler cover forms the 'bonnet' of the car with the sight-glass for checking the water level being the 'radiator grille'. Early versions sported the traditional overflow plug, which was replaced by the sight glass in 1978 to conform with the new Euro Toy Regulations. The earliest Roadsters were meths fired, appearing in late 1976. From about 1977 all models used a steel pan type solid <b>fuel</b> <b>burner,</b> although the older steel pan meths burners still fitted. The oscillating-cylinder engine is mounted externally on the left-hand side of the model and incorporates a simple forward and reverse lever like that used on the SE2a and MEC1 stationary engines. The unit drives a small solid flywheel mounted externally on the right-hand side via a shaft. Again a distinguishing feature of early models is the 'split-drive' with final drive on the left hand side as opposed to later (and current) models were the drive is all on the right. This shaft drives the rear axle by a power band. This arrangement allows a slightly higher road speed than the SW1 wagon but much slower than the TE1 traction engine (which was ridiculously too fast). This chassis and layout is used on other mobiles in the Mamod ranges such as the LB1 London bus, FE1 fire engine, SA1L limousine as well as the DV1/2 vans. The early wheels are in the style of wooden carriage wheels (as found on cars of the period - these were known as artillery wheels), with solid rubber tyres. Later models used a redesigned wheel which was based upon the design used for the Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. Details such as running boards, spare wheel and carriage lamps are also fitted.|$|E

The {{environmental}} and economic conditions that prevail demand that farmers make constant changes and improvements to their farming systems. In this research the performances of four representative farming systems, designated ‘Reduced Till’, ‘Hungry Sheep’, ‘Fuel Burners ’ and ‘No Till’, were examined and evaluated using economic and technical criteria. Activity gross margins were produced {{and a number of}} sustainability measures recorded and examined over number of trial ‘paddocks ’ over a period of six years from 2000 to 2005.

The No Till system trailed the field. Reduced Till, Hungry Sheep and Fuel Burners had comparable economic performances. Reduced Till had a mean economic performance similar to <b>Fuel</b> <b>Burner</b> and Hungry Sheep, though his system also had a greater ’down-side ’ risk, with paddocks that lost the largest amounts of money in some years. Conversely, paddocks under the <b>Fuel</b> <b>Burner</b> and Hungry Sheep systems produced the lowest losses in the poor years and, significantly, achieved the highest gross margins by a considerable margin in the good years. <b>Fuel</b> <b>Burner</b> was the least volatile system, closely followed by Hungry Sheep.

40|$|Electric arc {{furnaces}} (EAF) {{are complex}} industrial plants whose actual behavior depends upon numerous factors. Due to its energy intensive operation, the EAF process {{has always been}} subject to optimization efforts. For these reasons, several models have been proposed in literature to analyze and predict different modes of operation. Most of these models focused on the processes inside the vessel itself. The present paper introduces a dynamic, physics-based model of a complete EAF plant which consists of the four subsystems vessel, electric system, electrode regulation, and off-gas system. Furthermore the solid phase is not treated to be homogenous but a simple spatial discretization is employed.
