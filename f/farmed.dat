5|$|Pigs {{were the}} primary meat eaten by early Welsh folk, which could be {{preserved}} easily by salting. By 1700, {{there were a number}} of different Welsh breeds of pig, with long snouts and thin backs, generally light coloured, but some were dark or spotted.

5|$|As well as {{the wild}} stock, about 79 million metric tons (87 million tons) of food and non-food {{products}} were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species {{of plants and animals}} were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts, and jellyfish. Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed <b>farmed</b> shellfish from the waste being produced by <b>farmed</b> salmon. Various methods are employed. Mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters, or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweed—red, green, and brown algae—are eaten worldwide, some long <b>farmed</b> in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire, which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's <b>farmed</b> Farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia.|$|E

Meanwhile, the remaining sheep on Boreray were left to become feral; these became the only survivors of the crofters' sheep, {{and one of the few}} surviving descendants of the Dunface. This means that they are the original, unmodified sheep that used to be <b>farmed</b> on the island.

40|$|During {{the course}} of development, wages and labor {{productivity}} are much higher in the nonfarm {{sectors of the economy}} than in agriculture. In this paper, we examine the sources and consequences of wage and productivity gaps in the U. S. from 1800 to 2000. We build a quantitative general equilibrium model that closely matches the two-century long paths of <b>farm</b> and non-farm labor productivity growth, schooling, and fertility in the U. S. The family <b>farm</b> emerges as an important institution that contributes to differences in wages and labor productivity. Income from <b>farm</b> ownership compensates <b>farm</b> workers for the relatively low labor productivity and wages earned in agriculture. <b>Farm</b> ownership, along with the higher cost of raising children off the <b>farm,</b> generated a two-fold gap in labor productivity across the <b>farm</b> and nonfarm sectors in the 19 th century US. Consequently, the reallocation of labor from <b>farming</b> to industry raised the average annual growth rate of output per worker by about half a percentage point over the 19 th century.

5|$|The main {{threat to}} {{crocodilians}} {{around the world}} is human activity, including hunting and habitat destruction. Early in the 1970s, more than 2 million wild crocodilian skins of a variety of species had been traded, driving down the majority of crocodilian populations, in some cases almost to extinction. Starting in 1973, CITES attempted to prevent trade in body parts of endangered animals, such as the skins of crocodiles. This proved to be problematic in the 1980s, as crocodiles were abundant and dangerous to humans in some parts of Africa, and it was legal to hunt them. At the Conference of the Parties in Botswana in 1983, it was argued on behalf of aggrieved local people that it was reasonable to sell the lawfully hunted skins. In the late 1970s, crocodiles began to be <b>farmed</b> in different countries, started from eggs taken from the wild. By the 1980s, <b>farmed</b> crocodile skins were produced in sufficient numbers to destroy the unlawful trade in wild crocodilians. By 2000, skins from twelve crocodilian species, whether harvested lawfully in the wild or <b>farmed,</b> were traded by thirty countries, and the unlawful trade in the products had almost vanished.|$|E
