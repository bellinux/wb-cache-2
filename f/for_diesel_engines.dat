5|$|The Vanaja petrol engines made by SAT and Tampella were {{outdated}} American engines built under licence. Customers wanted diesel engines, {{which were}} more powerful. The first Vanaja diesel models were powered by Kämper and Saurer engines. VAT also tested Südwerke's two-stroke diesel engines {{but only one}} such vehicle was built. Import licences <b>for</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engines</b> were difficult to obtain and this constrained vehicle sales. In some cases, customers provided their own enginesfor example Volvo or Mercedes-Benz, which were mounted to their ordered vehicles on the assembly line. In 1955, VAT bought two batches of 6-cylinder 90-hp Leyland 0.350 diesel engines. These proved to be too inefficient, and the following year the company ordered a batch of 300 stronger Leylands made in the Netherlands by van Doorne's Automobilfabriek N.V.|$|E

25|$|Having {{witnessed}} {{the power of}} German tanks in the Spanish Civil War, he designed the 37 mm Gun M3, a light but powerful anti-tank gun. Barnes was promoted to brigadier general in October 1940, and major general in March 1943. As such, {{he was responsible for}} the research, development and standardization of 1,600 different weapons. Around $50 billion was spent on them. Barnes sought to develop medium and heavy tanks, but was stymied by the technical capability of American industry at the time, particularly its inability to develop a sufficiently powerful engine. He pressed, without success, <b>for</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engines,</b> and for the adoption of the M6 heavy tank.|$|E
25|$|It {{is also a}} {{promising}} fuel in diesel engines, petrol engines (30% DME / 70% LPG), and gas turbines. <b>For</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engines,</b> an advantage is the high cetane number of 55, {{compared to that of}} diesel fuel from petroleum, which is 40–53. Only moderate modifications are needed to convert a diesel engine to burn dimethyl ether. The simplicity of this short carbon chain compound leads during combustion to very low emissions of particulate matter, NOx, and CO. For these reasons as well as being sulfur-free, dimethyl ether meets even the most stringent emission regulations in Europe (EURO5), U.S. (U.S. 2010), and Japan (2009 Japan). Mobil uses dimethyl ether in their methanol to gasoline process.|$|E
25|$|The need {{to develop}} {{improved}} steels was driven by a desire for deeper-diving submarines. To avoid detection by sonar, submarines ideally operate at least 100 metres below the Sonic Layer Depth. World War II submarines operated at a total depth of rarely more than 100 metres. With the development of nuclear submarines, their new independence from the surface for an air supply <b>for</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engines</b> meant that they could focus on hidden operation at depth, rather than operating largely as surface-cruising submersibles. The increased power of a nuclear reactor allowed their hulls to become larger and faster. Developments in sonar made them able to hunt effectively at depth, {{rather than relying on}} visual observations from periscope depth. All these factors drove a need for improved steels for stronger pressure hulls.|$|E

25|$|In 1919 Ricardo was {{studying}} the phenomena affecting the combustion within the petrol engine and the diesel engine. He realised that turbulence within the combustion chamber increased flame speed, {{and that he}} could achieve this by offsetting the cylinder head. He also realised that making the chamber as compact as possible would reduce the distance that the flame had to travel and would reduce the likelihood of detonation. He later developed the induction swirl chamber, which was an attempt to achieve orderly air motion in a diesel engine, the swirl being initiated by inclined ports and accentuated by forcing the air into a small cylindrical volume. Finally he developed the compression swirl chamber <b>for</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engines.</b> This design embodied intense swirl with a reasonable rate of pressure rise and good fuel consumption.|$|E
25|$|Diesel-powered {{vehicles}} {{can often}} transition completely to biodiesel, though the fuel {{is a very}} strong solvent, which can occasionally damage rubber seals in vehicles built before 1994. More commonly, however, biodiesel causes problems simply because it removes all of the built-up residue in an engine, clogging filters, unless care is taken when switching from dirty fossil-fuel derived diesel to bio-diesel. It is very effective at 'de-coking' the diesel engines combustion chambers and keeping them clean. Biodiesel is the lowest emission fuel available <b>for</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engines.</b> Diesel engines are the most efficient car internal combustion engines. Biodiesel is the only fuel allowed in some North American national parks because spillages will completely bio-degrade within 21 days. Biodiesel and vegetable oil fuelled, diesel engined vehicles have been declared amongst the greenest in the US Tour de Sol competition.|$|E
