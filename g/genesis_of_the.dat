5|$|The Target {{novelisation}} of this serial, {{written by}} Terrance Dicks, {{was published by}} Tandem in 1976. It was re-released by Virgin Publishing in 1991, bearing its designated number of 27 in the novilisation range.

5|$|Suggestions {{to explain}} the mythical blue men include {{that they may be}} a {{personification}} of the sea, or originate with the Picts, whose painted bodies may have given the impression of men raising themselves out of the water if they were seen crossing the sea in boats that might have resembled kayaks. The <b>genesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blue men may alternatively lie with the North African slaves the Vikings took with them to Scotland, where they spent the winter months close to the Shiant Isles in the Minch.|$|E
5|$|England's {{most recent}} inductees into the IRB Hall are 19th-century internationals Alfred St. George Hamersley and Robert Seddon, both {{inducted}} in 2013. Hamersley played for England in the first-ever rugby union international against Scotland in 1871, and captained England {{in the last}} of his four appearances in 1874. He went on to play significant roles in the early development of the sport in both New Zealand and Canada. Seddon, capped three times for England in 1887, was most notable as the captain of the unofficial British side that toured Australia and New Zealand in 1888; he died in a boating accident during the tour. This venture proved to be the <b>genesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern British and Irish Lions. The touring team was also inducted alongside Seddon.|$|E

5|$|<b>Genesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Daleks was {{originally}} commissioned under producer Barry Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks, {{who felt that}} the outline submitted by Nation was too similar to his previous Dalek adventures, and encouraged him to explore {{the origin of the}} Daleks. The story introduces the Daleks' creator Davros (Michael Wisher), who had a unique visual design. The script was handed to Letts and Dicks' successors, producer Philip Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes, who made changes to the original script which gave it a darker tone. Nation, having intentionally modelled the Daleks on the Nazis, further explored the theme in Genesis. It also addresses the moral issues that come with time travelling and genocide. The story was filmed over January and February 1975, with some location filming in a quarry in Betchworth.|$|E
5|$|<b>Genesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Daleks was {{released}} on VHS by BBC Enterprises in 1991 with The Sontaran Experiment, and again {{as part of a}} box set of stories featuring Davros in 2001. It {{was released}} on DVD as a two-disc special edition in the United Kingdom by BBC Worldwide on 10 April 2006 and in the United States by Warner Home Video on 6 June 2006. This DVD is also available as part of the limited edition 2007 release of The Complete Davros Collection box set along with Destiny of the Daleks, Resurrection of the Daleks, Revelation of the Daleks and Remembrance of the Daleks.|$|E
5|$|Louis-François Bertin was 66 in 1832, {{the year}} of the portrait. He befriended Ingres either through his son Édouard Bertin, a student of the painter, or via Étienne-Jean Delécluze, Ingres' friend and the Journals art critic. In either case the <b>genesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{commission}} is unknown. Bertin was a leader of the French upper class and a supporter of Louis Philippe and the Bourbon Restoration. He was a director of the Le Moniteur Universel until 1823, when the Journal des débats became the recognised voice of the liberal-constitutional opposition after he had come to criticize absolutism. He eventually gave his support to the July Monarchy. The Journal supported contemporary art, and Bertin was a patron, collector and cultivator of writers, painters and other artists. Ingres was sufficiently intrigued by Bertin's personality to accept the commission.|$|E

40|$|This study proposes {{mathematical}} {{models for}} functional differentiations that {{are viewed as}} self-organization with external constraints. From <b>the</b> viewpoint <b>of</b> system development, <b>the</b> present study investigates how system components emerge under <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> constraints that act on a whole system. Cell differentiation in embryos and functional differentiation in cortical modules are typical examples of this phenomenon. In this paper, as case studies, we deal with three mathematical models that yielded components via such global constraints: <b>the</b> <b>genesis</b> <b>of</b> neuronal elements, <b>the</b> <b>genesis</b> <b>of</b> functional modules, and <b>the</b> <b>genesis</b> <b>of</b> neuronal interactions. <b>The</b> overall development <b>of</b> a system may follow a certain variational principle...|$|R
5|$|The Bengals {{entered the}} NFL in 1970 {{as a result}} of the AFL–NFL merger, and were placed in the newly formed American Football Conference {{alongside}} the Browns. A career-ending injury to Cook before the 1970 season forced the Bengals to rely on Virgil Carter, an emergency backup who could make accurate short passes but could not heave the ball like Cook once could. So Brown and Walsh went to work designing an offense around Carter's limitations, a scheme that was the <b>genesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West Coast offense Walsh later used to great effect when he became coach of the San Francisco 49ers.|$|E
5|$|The <b>genesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project came in 1998 as Pixar was {{finishing}} work on A Bug's Life. At that time Jorgen Klubien began writing a new script called The Yellow Car, about an electric car {{living in a}} gas-guzzling world. Some of the original drawings and characters were produced in 1998 and the producers agreed that Cars {{could be the next}} movie after A Bug's Life and would be released in early 1999, particularly around June 4. However, the movie was eventually scrapped in favor of Toy Story 2. Later, production resumed with major script changes, like giving Mater, Doc, and a few other characters a bigger part.|$|E
5|$|The <b>genesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{storm is}} unknown; {{it was first}} {{observed}} on September12 as a 70mph (120km/h) tropical storm about 550miles (885km) northeast of Antigua in the Lesser Antilles. On that day, the storm appeared on weather maps, and subsequently was tracked by ship reports as a small system. The storm tracked quickly northwestward, followed by a turn to the west-northwest. Around 18:00UTC on September13, the storm passed about 270mi (435km) south of Bermuda. Its exact track and intensity is unknown, though it is estimated the storm attained hurricane status late on September14 about 360mi (580km) west-southwest of Bermuda. The hurricane steadily intensified as it curved northward, and attained an estimated peak intensity of 100mph (155km/h) late on September15 about 110mi (190km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Genesis</b> version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game sold 1.02 {{million copies}} in the United States. While Sonic 1s {{worldwide}} sales have been estimated at 15 million and Sonic 2s at 6 million, Sonic 3, unlike these two, was not bundled with the Genesis console itself. However, Sonic 3 is still one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best-selling <b>Genesis</b> games <b>of</b> all time.|$|R
5|$|The oldest known Greek {{literary}} sources, Homer's epic poems Iliad and Odyssey, {{focus on}} the Trojan War and its aftermath. Two poems by Homer's near contemporary Hesiod, the Theogony and the Works and Days, contain accounts of the <b>genesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, the succession of divine rulers, the succession of human ages, the origin of human woes, and the origin of sacrificial practices. Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns, in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle, in lyric poems, {{in the works of}} the tragedians and comedians of the fifth century BC, in writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age, and in texts {{from the time of the}} Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias.|$|E
5|$|The power vacuum the Vietnamese {{communist}}s left in {{its wake}} in Cambodia was soon filled by the return of a young group of Cambodian communist revolutionaries, many of whom received their communist education in France. In 1960, the KPRP {{changed its name to}} the Kampuchean Communist Party (KCP), and the name was later adopted by the majority coalition that formed around Saloth Sar (Pol Pot), Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan as the ‘true’ political institution memorialising the KCP. This clique became the <b>genesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Khmer Rouge, and its doctrine was heavily influenced by the Maoist ideology.|$|E
5|$|When Peano {{formulated}} his axioms, {{the language}} of mathematical logic was in its infancy. The system of logical notation he created to present the axioms did not prove to be popular, although it was the <b>genesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern notation for set membership (∈, which comes from Peano's ε) and implication (⊃, which comes from Peano's reversed 'C'.) Peano maintained {{a clear distinction between}} mathematical and logical symbols, which was not yet common in mathematics; such a separation had first been introduced in the Begriffsschrift by Gottlob Frege, published in 1879. Peano was unaware of Frege's work and independently recreated his logical apparatus {{based on the work of}} Boole and Schröder.|$|E

5|$|From 1971 onwards, Harvey was the {{chairman}} of selectors. It was a tumultuous period in Australian cricket, where captain Bill Lawry was acrimoniously sacked {{in the middle of the}} 1970–71 series against England after a dispute between players and Australian officials. Lawry was not informed of his fate and learned of his omission on the radio when he was still one of Australia's most productive batsmen. The dispute was the <b>genesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pay dispute which, led to the formation of World Series Cricket in 1977 and generated a mass exodus of players. This resulted in the recall of Bob Simpson after ten years in retirement at the age of 41 to captain the Test team. Following the rapprochement between the establishment and the WSC players, Harvey left the selection panel. The WSC representatives felt that Harvey's anti-WSC comments made him prejudiced against the selection of former WSC players.|$|E
5|$|The <b>genesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{removal of}} the HNC was a power {{struggle}} within the ruling junta. Khánh, who had been saved from an earlier coup attempt in September 1964 by the intervention of some younger generals dubbed the Young Turks, was indebted to them and needed to satisfy their wishes to stay in power. The Young Turks disliked a group of older officers {{who had been in}} high leadership positions but were now in powerless posts, and wanted to sideline them completely. As a result, they decided to hide their political motives by introducing a policy to compulsorily retire all general officers with more than 25 years of service. The chief of state Phan Khắc Sửu, an elderly figure appointed by the military to give a semblance of civilian rule, did not want to sign the decree without the agreement of the HNC, which mostly consisted of old men. The HNC recommended against the new policy, and the younger officers, led by I Corps commander General Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, disbanded the body and arrested some of its members along with other politicians.|$|E
5|$|Written by Gerry Davis, this four-part {{story was}} {{submitted}} on spec {{to the production}} office around February 1982. It concerned the Doctor arriving on Mondas {{at a point in}} time when the Cybermen are being created. The rough storyline was where the Doctor and his companion “Felicity” arrive on the planet Mondas, Earth's twin orbiting {{on the opposite side of}} the Sun. While the Doctor works on a piece of TARDIS equipment, Felicity encounters the gentle Prince Sylvan. Sylvan accidentally activates the TARDIS, sending him, the Doctor and Felicity fifty years into the future. There, Sylvan's brother, Dega, is now king and has used the Doctor's device to begin turning his people into Cybermen. He has constructed a space fleet with which he intends to invade the mineral-rich Earth, and plans to kill any unconverted Mondans with cyanide gas. Felicity appeals to Dega's partly Cybernised wife, Queen Meta, and she shoots her husband dead—only to be killed by Dega's chief of staff, Krail. In the confusion, Sylvan and a band of Mondan rebels flee in the spaceships to Earth; the massive concussion of take-off knocks Mondas out of its orbit into deep space. Former script editor Davis submitted this idea circa early 1981, intending it to be a prequel to his and Kit Pedler's original Cyberman serial, The Tenth Planet (which also featured Cyberman Krail). It also borrowed elements from The Ark and The Savages, two stories which Davis had been story editor on. Producer John Nathan-Turner and script editor Antony Root were ultimately not interested in <b>Genesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cybermen. Davis wrote his storyline with only the Doctor and one female companion in mind; he called this character “Felicity” rather than writing with any particular companion in mind. This idea would be later explored in the Big Finish audio adventure Spare Parts by Marc Platt and released in July 2002. In turn Spare Parts was heavily borrowed from for the television episodes Rise of the Cybermen and The Age of Steel in 2006.|$|E
