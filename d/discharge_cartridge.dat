5000|$|Almost {{all modern}} {{semi-automatic}} handguns, except some exact replicas of antique models, {{have some form}} of safety mechanism including a [...] "drop safety" [...] that requires a trigger pull to <b>discharge</b> a <b>cartridge.</b> Single-action designs such as the Colt 1911 virtually always incorporate a manual safety, while traditional double-action pistols incorporate a decocker, manual safety, or both. However, the exact configuration depends on handgun type, year, make, and model. Double-action only (DAO) pistols, which usually use designs similar to traditional double-action but without the ability to remain cocked, do not usually have external safeties.|$|R
50|$|Single-action handguns have {{a trigger}} whose sole {{function}} is to drop a pre-cocked hammer to <b>discharge</b> a <b>cartridge.</b> For revolvers, the popular Colt Peacemaker of Old West fame is typically thought of. Its hammer must be manually cocked for each shot. For auto-loading pistols the Colt 1911 or Browning Hi-Power are typical examples. They must be cocked for the first shot, but subsequent shots are cocked automatically due to the racking of the slide. These types of guns typically have a very light and crisp trigger pull, making for more accurate target shooting.|$|R
5000|$|A semi-automatic, self-loading, or [...] "auto loader" [...] firearm is {{one that}} {{performs}} all steps necessary to prepare it for firing again after a single <b>discharge,</b> until <b>cartridges</b> are no longer available in the weapon's feed device or magazine. Auto loaders fire one shot with each pull of the trigger. Some people confuse the term with [...] "fully automatic" [...] firearms. (See next.) While some semi-automatic rifles may resemble military-style firearms, they are not properly classified [...] "Assault Weapons" [...] which refers to those that continue to fire until the finger no longer depressed the trigger.|$|R
5000|$|Wounds {{caused by}} contact shots are very devastating, {{as the body}} absorbs the entire <b>discharge</b> of the <b>{{cartridge}},</b> not just the projectile.

5000|$|Gunshot residue (GSR), {{also known}} as <b>cartridge</b> <b>{{discharge}}</b> residue (CDR), [...] "gunfire residue" [...] (GFR), or firearm discharge residue (FDR), is residue deposited on the hands and clothes of someone who discharges a firearm. It is principally composed of burnt and unburnt particles from the explosive primer, the propellant—and possibly fragments of the bullet, cartridge case, and the firearm.|$|R
25|$|Pre-set hybrid {{triggers}} {{are similar}} to a DA/SA trigger in reverse. The first pull of the trigger is pre-set. If the striker or hammer fail to <b>discharge</b> the <b>cartridge,</b> the trigger may be pulled again and will operate as a double-action only (DAO) until the <b>cartridge</b> <b>discharges</b> or the malfunction is cleared. This allows the operator to attempt a second time to fire a cartridge after a misfire malfunction, {{as opposed to a}} single-action, in which the only thing to do if a round fails to fire is to rack the slide, clearing the round and recocking the hammer. While this can be advantageous in that many rounds will fire on being struck a second time, and it is faster to pull the trigger a second time than to cycle the action, if the round fails to fire on the second strike, the user will be forced to clear the round anyway, thus using up even more time than if they had simply done so in the first place. The Taurus PT 24/7 Pro pistol (not {{to be confused with the}} first-generation 24/7 which was a traditional pre-set) offered this feature starting in 2006. The Walther P99 Anti-Stress is another example.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the early}} part of its career, the M16 had a {{reputation}} for poor reliability and a malfunction rate of two per 1000 rounds fired. The M16's action works by passing high pressure propellant gasses tapped from the barrel down a tube and into the carrier group within the upper receiver, and is commonly referred to as a [...] "direct impingement gas system". The gas expands within a donut shaped gas cylinder within the carrier. Because the bolt is prevented from moving forward by the barrel, the carrier is driven to the rear by the expanding gasses and thus converts the energy of the gas to movement of the rifle’s parts. The bolt bears a piston head and the cavity in the bolt carrier is the piston sleeve. It is more correct to call it an [...] "internal piston" [...] system." [...] This design is much lighter and more compact than a gas-piston design. However, this design requires that combustion byproducts from the <b>discharged</b> <b>cartridge</b> be blown into the receiver as well. This accumulating carbon and vaporized metal build-up within the receiver and bolt-carrier negatively affects reliability and necessitates more intensive maintenance {{on the part of the}} individual soldier. The channeling of gasses into the bolt carrier during operation increases the amount of heat that is deposited in the receiver while firing the M16 and causes essential lubricant to be [...] "burned off". This requires frequent and generous applications of appropriate lubricant. Lack of proper lubrication is the most common source of weapon stoppages or jams.|$|R
50|$|The M1951 {{is fed from}} an 8-round {{detachable}} box magazine. A hold open device {{will keep}} the slide locked open after <b>discharging</b> the last <b>cartridge</b> from the magazine. The slide can then be released by depressing the slide release lever located {{on the left side}} of the frame. The pistol uses fixed iron sights set for engaging targets at 50 m. These consist of a forward blade and rear notch.|$|R
50|$|A {{dangerous}} situation can occur when a chambered round fires when the firearm is out-of-battery (called an out-of-battery <b>discharge).</b> The <b>cartridge</b> casing is not sufficiently strong {{to contain the}} pressure of firing by itself; it relies {{on the walls of}} the chamber and the bolt face to help contain the pressure. When the firearm is out-of-battery, the round is not fully chambered, or the bolt face is not against the rear of the cartridge, and if the round is fired in this situation, the case will fail, causing high-pressure hot gasses, bits of burning powder, and fragments of the casing itself to be thrown at high-speed from the firearm. This can be a serious hazard to the operator of the firearm, and any bystanders.|$|R
50|$|Rimfire is {{a method}} of {{ignition}} for metallic firearm cartridges {{as well as the}} cartridges themselves. It is called rimfire because the firing pin of a gun strikes and crushes the base's rim to ignite the primer. The rim of the rimfire cartridge is essentially an extended and widened percussion cap which contains the priming compound, while the cartridge case itself contains the propellant powder and the projectile (bullet). Once the rim of the cartridge has been struck and the bullet <b>discharged,</b> the <b>cartridge</b> cannot be reloaded, because the head has been deformed by the firing pin impact. While many other different cartridge priming methods have been tried since the 19th century, only rimfire technology and centerfire technology survive today in significant use.|$|R

25|$|Firearms use {{triggers}} {{to initiate}} the firing of a cartridge in the firing chamber of the weapon. This is accomplished by actuating a striking device {{through a combination of}} spring and kinetic energy operating through a firing pin to strike and ignite the primer. There are two primary types of striking mechanisms, hammers and strikers. Hammers are spring-tensioned masses of metal that pivot on a pin when released and strike a firing pin to <b>discharge</b> a <b>cartridge.</b> Strikers are, essentially, spring-loaded firing pins that travel on an axis in-line with the cartridge eliminating the need for a separate hammer. The connection between the trigger and the hammer is generally referred to as the sear surface. Variable mechanisms will have this surface directly on the trigger and hammer or have separate sears or other connecting parts.|$|R
50|$|Pre-set {{triggers}} {{are only}} on autoloading pistols. In {{this case the}} pistol mechanism is always partially cocked while being carried and during firing. The partially cocked firing pin or striker is not cocked enough to cause an accidental release to <b>discharge</b> a <b>cartridge,</b> adding {{to the safety of}} the design, but is cocked enough to remove much of the trigger pull and weight of a purely double-action pistol. These types of pistols do not have external hammers and do not generally have a decock function. Common pistols in the category are the HS2000 (Springfield XD) and the various forms of the extremely popular Glock. The trigger pull of these guns is between double-action and single-action pistols. Pre-set triggers {{may or may not have}} a second-strike feature on a dud cartridge.|$|R

40|$|Estimating {{the time}} since <b>discharge</b> of spent <b>cartridges</b> can be a {{valuable}} tool in the forensic investigation of firearm-related crimes. To reach this aim, it was previously proposed that the decrease of volatile organic compounds released during discharge is monitored over time using non-destructive headspace extraction techniques. While promising results were obtained for large-calibre cartridges (e. g., shotgun shells), handgun calibres yielded unsatisfying results. In addition to the natural complexity of the specimen itself, these can also be attributed to some selective choices in the methods development. Thus, the present series of paper aimed to more systematically evaluate the potential of headspace analysis to estimate {{the time since}} <b>discharge</b> of <b>cartridges</b> {{through the use of}} more comprehensive analytical and interpretative techniques. Specifically, in this first part, a method based on headspace sorptive extraction (HSSE) was comprehensively optimised and validated, as the latter recently proved to be a more efficient alternative than previous approaches.

A multivariate statistical approach based on design of experiments (DOE) was used to optimise variables potentially involved in interaction effects. Introduction of deuterated analogues in sampling vials was also investigated as strategy to account for analytical variations. Analysis was carried out by selected ion mode, gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results showed good chromatographic resolution as well as detection limits and peak area repeatability.

Several multivariate regression and pre-treatment methods were tested and compared to univariate models based on non-linear regression. Random forests (RF) and partial least squares (PLS) proceeded by pairwise log-ratios normalisation (PLR) showed the best results, and allowed to estimate time since discharge up to 48 h of ageing and to differentiate recently fired from older cartridges (e. g., less than 5 h compared to more than 1 - 2 days).

5000|$|Velma Kelly's {{character}} {{was based on}} a woman named Belva Gaertner. Belva was a cabaret singer who had been married and divorced twice. After those men had come and gone, she had a lover named Walter Law, who she thought was the right man for her. On March 11, 1924, Belva shot Law, who was already married with one child.

She claimed that she had been drunk and couldn't remember what had happened. She was arrested for the murder of Walter Law on March 12, 1924. During her interview with Maurine Watkins, Gaertner told Watkins that [...] "gin and guns- either one is bad enough, but together they get you in a dickens of a mess, don't they." [...] Her defense in court was that he could have committed suicide, and she was released in June 1924. She remarried her husband William Gaertner and was later convicted of drunk driving in 1926. In 1927, she attended the opening of Watkins' play Chicago in Chicago, Illinois.|$|R
60|$|The muzzle of the rifle, {{four feet}} away, was bearing {{directly}} on him, when Grief resolved to act. The rifle wavered as Griffiths kept his {{balance in the}} uncertain puffs {{of the first of}} the wind. Grief took advantage of the wavering, made as if to sign the paper, and at the same instant, like a cat, exploded into swift and intricate action. As he ducked low and leaped forward with his body, his left hand flashed from under the screen of the table, and so accurately-timed was the single stiff pull on the self-cocking trigger that the <b>cartridge</b> <b>discharged</b> as the muzzle came forward. Not a whit behind was Griffiths. The muzzle of his weapon dropped to meet the ducking body, and, shot at snap direction, rifle and revolver went off simultaneously.|$|R
5000|$|After <b>discharging</b> {{the last}} <b>cartridge</b> from the magazine, the bolt carrier and bolt are held {{back on a}} bolt catch that is {{released}} by pulling the cocking handle to the rear. The rifle has a hammer-type striking mechanism and a manual lever safety selector. The firing pin is a [...] "free-floating" [...] type and, as a result, some soft-primered ammunition had the reputation of causing a [...] "slam fire" [...] event. Thus, military-grade ammunition with primers confirmed to be properly seated is recommended for the Dragunov and its variants. This appears to have solved the [...] "slam fire" [...] issue. The rifle's receiver is machined to provide additional accuracy and torsional strength. The Dragunov's receiver bears a number of similarities to the AK action, such as the large dust cover, iron sights and lever safety selector, but these similarities are primarily cosmetic in nature. These cosmetic similarities can lead to mis-categorization of the Dragunov as an AK variant.|$|R
40|$|A burst {{cartridge}} remaining in a reactor may eventually release such quantities of radioactive fission products into the coolant circuit as {{to cause a}} potential health hazard or maintenance difficulty. It is important, therefore, {{to be able to}} detect and locate a burst so that the reactor operator can <b>discharge</b> the <b>cartridge</b> concerned. Of all the possible methods, only detection by the released fission products is satisfactory. Gaseous fission products diffuse through the leak in the can wall against a coolant inflow induced by oxidation of the fuel, and their presence in the coolant has to be detected against an unavoidable background count. The leak size at the threshold of detection can be estimated from the operating conditions, {{and the manner in which}} b. c. d. ({{burst cartridge}} detection) signals arise from a developing burst merits special study. To discriminate against the radioactive decay of the coolant gas itself the precipitation system of monitoring is used. From each fuel channel in the reactor a sample of gas is drawn periodically. This is passed through a precipitation chamber where particular fission product nuclides decay to give ionized daughter products which are collected on a charged wire. The wire is moved to a shielded scintillation counter and the fission product nuclides, which undergo a second radioactive transition, are measured to the exclusion of the active nuclides in the coolant which do not. The performance and sensitivity of the system can be calculated and optimized by considering the expression for the count from the wire. The mechanical design of the equipment varies in detail from station to station. In later designs the mechanical equipment is simpler and easier to maintain, and greater use is being made of automatic processing and presentation of the signal...|$|R
40|$|Estimating {{the time}} since the last {{discharge}} of firearms and/or spent cartridges may be a useful piece of information in forensic firearm-related cases. The current approach consists of studying the diffusion of selected volatile organic compounds (such as naphthalene) released during the shooting using solid phase micro-extraction (SPME). However, this technique works poorly on handgun car-tridges because the extracted quantities quickly fall below the limit of detection. In order to find more effective solutions and further investigate the aging of organic gunshot residue after the <b>discharge</b> of handgun <b>cartridges,</b> an extensive study {{was carried out in}} this work using a novel approach based on high capacity headspace sorptive extraction (HSSE). By adopting this technique, for the first time 51 gunshot residue (GSR) volatile organic compounds could be simultaneously detected from fired handgun cartridge cases. Application to aged specimens showed that many of those compounds presented significant and complementary aging profiles. Compound-to-compound ratios were also tested and proved to be beneficial both in reducing the variability of the aging curves and in enlarging the time window useful in a forensic casework perspective. The obtained results were thus particularly promising {{for the development of a}} new complete forensic dating methodology...|$|R
40|$|Estimating {{the time}} since <b>discharge</b> of handgun <b>cartridges</b> may be a useful piece of {{information}} in the forensic investigation of firearm-related crimes. Many approaches were reported throughout the last century. The most promising were generally based on analysing over time the decrease in the headspace concentration of dissipating compounds released during the discharge (especially, the most volatile ones, such as naphthalene). Following the good results obtained in analogous applications (i. e., the estimation of {{the time since}} last discharge of firearms and shotgun shells), headspace solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography was recently suggested to analyse shot handgun cartridges. However, unsatisfactory results were reported, likely because of analytical limitations (reproducibility and sensitivity issues) and/or weak choices in target compounds and interpretative models. In an attempt to further study the potential of headspace analysis to estimate the time since <b>discharge</b> of handgun <b>cartridges,</b> a novel approach was developed in this PhD research. This {{was based on the}} extraction of fired cases by headspace sorptive extraction (HSSE), which is more exhaustive (and thus, more reproducible and sensitive) than SPME. Target compounds were {{selected on the basis of}} a preliminary study, and the entire analytical methodology was then optimized using a multivariate statistical approach based on the design-ofexperiments theory. Results showed good analytical performances in terms of detection limits and repeatability. Its application to real specimens revealed that the amounts of volatile GSR compounds rapidly decreased in the first hours after discharge (< 10 h), but they did not totally disappear from cartridge headspaces. Thus, through multivariate interpretation models, it was possible to provide time-since-discharge estimates up to 48 h and to differentiate recently fired cases from older ones. The best combinations of pretreatments and multivariate regression models were pairwise ratios followed by logarithm transformation (i. e., PLR) and random forests (RF) and/or partial least squares (PLS). The effects of several influential factors (i. e., cartridge position, humidity and temperature) were further studied. While all affected in some way the ageing kinetics of the single GSR compounds, they did not affect the multivariate models' dating accuracy, as long as there was no significant difference between reference and examined material. An evaluative model was also developed and allowed assigning a likelihood ratio to analytical outcomes given alternative hypotheses on the time since discharge forwarded by the parties at trial. Thus, headspace analysis of spent cartridges was found to provide helpful evidence to assist forensic practitioners in answering questions about time since discharge. Further research is needed, but results toward the development of a complete dating methodology, and its implementation in real forensic cases, are promising...|$|R
5000|$|A {{safety notch}} {{is one of}} the oldest forms of drop safety, used on older single-action revolvers {{manufactured}} before the invention of the hammer block, some lever-action rifles, 1911-pattern guns, and hammer-fired semi-automatics that were designed before the invention of the firing pin block. The safety notch is a relief cut made in the tumbler at the base of the hammer, that allows the sear to catch and hold the hammer a short distance from the pin or cartridge primer, in a [...] "half-cocked" [...] position. The safety notch works first by allowing the handler to retract the hammer a short distance from the firing pin or primer, such that dropping the firearm on its hammer will not result in an energy transfer to the pin or spur, which could then <b>discharge</b> a chambered <b>cartridge.</b> A second purpose is to allow the sear to [...] "catch" [...] a hammer that is falling when the trigger has not been pulled, such as in cases where a drop jarred the sear loose or when the hammer was not fully cocked before being released. However, a safety notch used to [...] "half-cock" [...] a firearm is an active feature that must be engaged, and does not positively prevent accidental discharges in all cases. A certain amount of manual dexterity and familiarity with a firearm is also required to [...] "half-cock" [...] a firearm; unfamiliarity with how to engage the [...] "half-cock" [...] position can result in accidental discharges.

For these purposes, 'modern manufacture' should be taken to mean manufacture after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939.Old weapons which should not benefit from the exemption as antiques under section 58(2) of the Firearms Act 1968NB: This list is not exhaustive and there may be other types and calibres of firearms that should be considered 'modern' rather than 'antique'.a) Shotguns and smooth-bored guns, including shot pistols, chambered for standard shotgun cartridges, [...]22 inch, [...]23 inch, 6mm and 9mm rim-fire cartridges;).b) Rifles and handguns chambered for 4mm, 5mm, [...]22 inch, [...]23 inch, 6mm or 9mm rim-fire ammunition;c) Revolvers, single-shot pistols and self-loading pistols which are chambered for, and will accept, popular centre-fire cartridges of the type [...]25, [...]32, [...]38, [...]380, [...]44, [...]450, [...]455 and [...]476 inch, or their metric equivalents including 6.35, 7.62, 7.63, 7.65 , 8 and 9mm, unless otherwise specified;d) Modern reproduction firearms or old firearms which have been modified to allow the use of shotgun cartridges or cartridges not listed in Annex B;e) Extensively modified weapons (e.g. Sawn off shotguns);f) Very signalling pistols chambered for 1 and 1½ inch cartridges or 26.5/27mm cartridges;g) Pump-action and self-loading centre fire rifles, except that examples originally chambered for one of the obsolete cartridges listed at Annex B and retaining that original chambering, may benefit from exemption as antiques under section 58(2) of the Firearms Act 1968 (as amended) ...|$|R
