25|$|Looking at {{that picture}} today makes me cringe. It {{was done in}} the worst {{possible}} taste. Back then I was too immature to see that. Shame on me—I should have done everything in my power to stop it. The record company came up with the <b>idea,</b> <b>I</b> think. The lyrics incidentally were a take-off on Kiss, whom we had just supported on a tour. I was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised 'cause he's a virgin killer!' trying to do a more or less way-off-the-mark Paul Stanley impersonation. Klaus immediately said 'that's great! You should do something with it.' Then I had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title, which I actually managed to do to some degree. But the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first. Virgin Killer is none other than the demon of our time, the less compassionate side of the societies we live in today—brutally trampling upon {{the heart and soul of}} innocence.|$|E

It reminded me of growing up and listening to the radio and that feeling the song gave me seemed to go with the melody and basic <b>idea</b> <b>I</b> had for [...] "Fantasy." [...] I initially told Dave about the idea, and we did it. We called up the Tom Tom Club and they were really into it.|$|E

500|$|On February 2, 2015, Paul {{generated}} controversy {{by suggesting}} that states should not require parents to vaccinate their children, because parents should {{have the freedom to}} make that decision for their children. In an interview with CNBC on February 2, Paul clarified this statement, commenting [...] "I'm not arguing vaccines are a bad <b>idea.</b> <b>I</b> think they are a good thing, but I think the parent should have some input. The state doesn't own your children. Parents own the children, and it is an issue of freedom." [...] On February 3, he posted a photograph to Twitter of himself being vaccinated.|$|E

And that's the <b>idea</b> <b>I</b> have in my head– surrounded by communication lines and traffic and debris thrown out of spaceships." [...] Rhys has claimed that the theory was initially his girlfriend's father's. The track was recorded in 2000 at Monnow Valley Studio, Rockfield, Monmouthshire and was produced by the Super Furry Animals and Chris Shaw.|$|E

500|$|Moore {{considered}} {{the writing of}} Blood to be harder compared to previous OSI albums. Previously, Matheos would send Moore guitar parts to work with, allowing Moore to [...] "work with editing them, pitching them, and fucking about them different ways, and then programming drums and keyboards." [...] When working on Blood, Matheos also provided programming, keyboard and drum parts. [...] "If he sent me stuff that already had drums and keyboard parts, and it wasn't a complete <b>idea,</b> <b>I</b> {{had to figure out}} a way to elaborate on it without having that same equipment that he has there," [...] Moore said. Overall, he {{considered the}} writing process to be [...] "smoother because we got on a roll and we're more fluid together".|$|E
500|$|He first {{considered}} doing {{a documentary}} or a low-budget feature film {{about people who}} believed in UFOs. Spielberg decided [...] "a film that depended on {{state of the art}} technology couldn't be made for $2.5million." [...] Borrowing a phrase from the ending of The Thing from Another World, he retitled the film Watch the Skies, rewriting the premise concerning Project Blue Book and pitching the concept to Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz. Katz remembered [...] "It had flying saucers from outer space landing on Robertson Boulevard [...] I go, 'Steve, that's the worst <b>idea</b> <b>I</b> ever heard." [...] Spielberg brought Paul Schrader to write the script in December 1973 with principal photography to begin in late 1974. However, Spielberg started work on Jaws in 1974, pushing Watch the Skies back.|$|E

500|$|Music {{journalists have}} noted the title and artwork as {{reflective}} of the album's musical influences. A columnist for the Santa Fe Reporter later described the artwork as [...] "totally cool, with a blocky style depicting some kind of Miami soul food/taco stand." [...] Music journalist Kimberley Chun of the San Francisco Bay Guardian wrote of the concept, stating [...] "So what is a soul food taquería? Do you get a side of collard greens with your menudo?" [...] In an interview with Chun, Guerrero discussed the concept and title, stating [...] "It's just this funny <b>idea</b> <b>I</b> had, {{growing up in the}} city – it's so diverse. The city itself is just down-home, down-to-earth, blue-collar, full of everyday kind of people. My music is along the same lines, just being simple – I just try to be honest in what I do." ...|$|E
500|$|Well, I {{actually}} had the <b>idea,</b> <b>I</b> wrote {{the story about}} what it is actually like to be in the Service, and it does take a lot of physical strength, but now that I've been through it – and even just for the three days I was there, [...] a lot of mental strength. We used only Marines, no actors or actresses. We used all of the Marine's equipment and they were so lovely to us, I always have fun even though it's a lot of work. Even though I was sore and exhausted, I was so educated on people in the service, who I've always respected but the stuff they go through, and the kind of loyalty they possess, it's very communal, and community. Not to sound weird, but it seems like the heart of America. Seriously, the heart.|$|E
500|$|In 1921, {{after years}} of {{pleading}} for proper schooling, Nancy was allowed a year's boarding at Hatherop Castle, an informal private establishment for young ladies of good family. Laura Thompson, in her biography of Nancy, describes Hatherop as not so much [...] a school, [...] "more a chaste foretaste of debutante life". Here Nancy learned French and other subjects, played organised games and joined a Girl Guide troop. It was her first extended experience of life away from home, and she enjoyed it. The following year she was allowed to accompany four other girls on a cultural trip to Paris, Florence and Venice; her letters home are full of expressions of wonder at the sights and treasures: [...] "I had no <b>idea</b> <b>I</b> was so fond of pictures... if only I had a room of my own I {{would make it a}} regular picture gallery".|$|E

Songz confirmed to MTV News that the previous would be a continuation of the latter. On the [...] "I Invented Sex" [...] clip, Songz said, [...] "It's very sensual. The <b>idea</b> <b>I</b> had, it came from a banned Calvin Klein ad. It was a dude and two girls and they was touching and kissing. I was like, 'Man, I wanna do that.' We didn't go all the way there.

The song {{is similar to}} the original recording of the song with the only noticeable change being that Kesha now sings the song's first verse. While being interviewed by Digital Spy Cruz explained how the cover initially came about and his view on the cover, [...] "she asked me if she could do a version of the song where she sang the first verse and I thought that was a really cool <b>idea.</b> <b>I</b> really like both versions, and it's good that there are these two different versions out there, because fans of me get more of me on mine and [...] fans get more of her on hers." ...|$|E

500|$|A year {{prior to}} {{recording}} the album, jazz producer Tommy LiPuma and an unnamed keyboardist tried out some ideas {{for five days}} with Paul McCartney at McCartney's home studio in East Sussex. Featuring just vocals and piano, the trio [...] "put about 15-20 songs on tape", to see what tracks would work. Around this time, an unknown McCartney original was recorded, {{with the help of}} engineer Geoff Emerick. The songs that McCartney would work on were voted upon democratically: McCartney comments, [...] "I pulled up some [...] from my memories, when I was a kid and we had family sing-songs, which was the original inspiration for the whole <b>idea,</b> <b>I</b> said to Tom, 'Let's look at these ones. This is the kind of era I want to look at.' Tommy himself suggested some; a girl in my office; [...] Diana [...] suggested some. Then I played Tommy a couple that I'd written, and he said, 'Whoa, that's a great idea,' so we selected a couple of those.
