500|$|The {{style of}} Kampung Boy {{does not follow}} that {{commonly}} found in Western graphic novels. [...] A page can be occupied fully by a single drawing, accompanied by text. [...] The image either presents a scene that stands on its own or segues into the next, forming a story sequence that flows across two <b>facing</b> <b>pages.</b> [...] The story is told in a local dialect of English, simpler in its grammatical structure and sprinkled with Malay words and phrases. [...] Deborah Stevenson, editor of The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, found that the narration invokes a sense of camaraderie with the reader, and carries an [...] "understated affection for family, neighbours and village life." [...] Mike Shuttleworth, reviewer for The Age, said that Lat often achieved humour in this book by illustrating the scene contrary to what was described. [...] Stevenson agreed, highlighting {{a scene in which}} Mat spoke of how his mother tenderly fed him porridge; the illustration, however, shows her irritation as the toddler spits the porridge back at her.|$|E
500|$|Long {{after the}} triumph of the Church of Scotland in the Lowlands, Highlanders and Islanders clung to a form of Christianity infused with animistic folk beliefs and practices. The {{remoteness}} of the region and the lack of a Gaelic-speaking clergy undermined missionary efforts. The Scottish Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge (SSPCK) was founded by Royal Charter in 1708. Its aim was partly religious and partly cultural, intending to [...] "wear out" [...] Gaelic and [...] "learn the people the English tongue". By 1715 it was running 25 schools, by 1755 it was 116 and by 1792 it was 149, but most were on the edges of the Highlands. The difficulty of promoting Protestantism and English in a Gaelic speaking region, eventually led to a change of policy in the SSPCK and in 1754 it sanctioned the printing of a Bible with Gaelic and English text on <b>facing</b> <b>pages.</b> The government only began to seriously promote Protestantism from 1725, when it began to make a grant to the General Assembly known as the Royal Bounty. Part of this went towards itinerant ministers, but by 1764 there were only ten. Probably more significant for the spread of Protestantism were the lay catechists, who met the people on the Sabbath, read Scripture, and joined them in Psalms and prayers. They would later be important in the Evangelical revival.|$|E

2500|$|Publication of {{the initial}} print run of 1000 copies, at the {{beginning}} of February 1901, came as something of an anticlimax. [...] The translation was presented as a study aid [...] "for exclusive family use" [...] at home; at the insistence of Prokopios it had been printed as a parallel text, with the koine original and the demotic translation on <b>facing</b> <b>pages.</b> [...] According to the one-page preface, probably written by the Queen herself, the work was intended to reach out to those who could not understand the original, and help them not to lose faith. [...] The preface also reminded readers that the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople had already given its approval to the Anaplasis translation.|$|E
2500|$|Autographs (original copies) of Luke and {{the other}} Gospels have not been preserved, as is typical for ancient documents; the texts that survive are third-generation copies, with no two {{completely}} identical. The earliest witnesses (the technical term for written manuscripts) for Luke's gospel fall into two [...] "families" [...] with considerable differences between them, the Western and the Alexandrian, and the dominant {{view is that the}} Western text represents a process of deliberate revision, as the variations seem to form specific patterns. The oldest witness is a fragment dating from the late 2nd century, while the oldest complete texts are the 4th century Codex Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, both from the Alexandrian family; Codex Bezae, a 5th- or 6th-century Western text-type manuscript that contains Luke in Greek and Latin versions on <b>facing</b> <b>pages,</b> appears to have descended from an offshoot of the main manuscript tradition, departing from more familiar readings at many points.|$|E

2500|$|Visually too {{the poems}} are varied {{in such a}} way as to enhance their meaning, with {{intricate}} rhyme schemes, stanzas combining different line lengths and other ingenious formal devices. The most obvious examples are pattern poems like [...] "The Altar," [...] in which the shorter and longer lines are arranged on the page in the shape of an altar. The visual appeal is reinforced by the conceit of its construction from a broken, stony heart, representing the personal offering of himself as a sacrifice upon it. Built into this is an allusion to Psalm 51:17: [...] "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart." [...] In the case of [...] "Easter Wings" [...] (illustrated here), the words were printed sideways on two <b>facing</b> <b>pages</b> so that the lines there suggest outspread wings. The words of the poem are paralleled between stanzas and mimic the opening and closing of the wings. In Herbert’s poems formal ingenuity is not an end in itself but is employed only as an auxiliary to its meaning.|$|E
