25|$|Section 10(b) of the Commemorative Works Act, {{as amended}} by Public Law 102-216 (December 11, 1991), limited the {{legislative}} authorization for memorials in the National Capital Region to seven years unless otherwise specified by the memorial's enacting legislation. A memorial's site and design must be approved; the memorial foundation must show that art, architectural, and historic preservationists were consulted in the memorial's design and siting; contracts for construction must be signed; and sufficient funds to complete construction of the memorial must be in hand before the seven-year deadline was reached. In 2003, Congress relaxed this standard slightly. The Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of the General Services Administration, in consultation with NCMC, had the discretion to issue a construction permit if both the NCPC and CFA had issued final (not preliminary) <b>design</b> <b>approval</b> and the foundation had 75 percent of the construction funds in hand. Furthermore, Section 8(b) of the Commemorative Works Act required that each memorial foundation raise an amount equal to 10 {{percent of the total}} construction cost, and to deposit these monies into a trust fund administered by the Department of the Interior to pay for the cost of perpetual maintenance and preservation of the work.|$|E

[...] But the United States Commission of Fine Arts, which had <b>design</b> <b>approval</b> authority over all private buildings adjacent to federal buildings in the city, objected to this facade. Koubek submitted a revised design which utilized larger, octagonal window designs of marble with recessed ribs of bronze aluminum, which not only was accepted but highly praised by influential architect Frederick Gutheim as pushing District architectural design [...] "forward 10 years." [...] A similar design was created for the facade of One Farragut Square South, which began construction in November 1960. A more Modernist glass-wall building was planned in October 1961 for 1666 Connecticut Avenue NW (the southwest corner of Connecticut Avenue NW and R Street NW).|$|E
500|$|Obedient to Palmer's instructions, Peddle sent Leech {{sketches}} of a seated Isabella, {{with the long}} inscription on the reverse; she hoped the Mint Director would allow her to shorten it.

[...] Barber and Bosbyshell wrote to Leech that Isabella's legs would appear distorted if the seated figure were used and advocated a head in profile. [...] Carlisle agreed, stating that he had only given permission for a head of Isabella. [...] Peddle was informed that Barber would produce the reverse, though the design would be sent to her for approval, and she would have to change her obverse. [...] Meanwhile, Palmer was growing increasingly anxious: with a timeline of two months from <b>design</b> <b>approval</b> to the availability of the actual coins, she feared that the pieces would not be available for sale until well into the fair's May to October run.

2500|$|<b>Design</b> <b>approval</b> for {{the canopy}} proved difficult. The design {{had to be}} {{approved}} by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), which has statutory authority to approve all buildings and renovations in the D.C. metropolitan area. Although the NCPC approved the preliminary design, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), the United States Department of the Interior, the D.C. State Preservation Office, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation all opposed the enclosure of the courtyard. The NCPC reversed its preliminary approval on June 2, 2005. Unwilling to lose the canopy, the Smithsonian brought five alternatives to the NCPC on August 4. On September 8, 2005, the NCPC reversed itself yet again, and approved one of the revised designs. The delay cost the Smithsonian $10 million. In October 2005, the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation made a $45 million donation to the NPG to finish both the building renovation and the canopy. The Smithsonian agreed to call the two museums, the conservation center, courtyard, storage facility, and other operations within the Old Patent Office complex the [...] "Donald W. Reynolds Center for American Art and Portraiture" [...] in appreciation for the gift. The National Portrait Gallery reopened on July 1, 2006.

The commission's plan for development of the city, popularly known as the McMillan Plan, proposed the razing of all residences and other buildings on Lafayette Square and building Neoclassical government office buildings around the park to house executive branch offices. It also proposed clearing large spaces north and south of the National Mall, realigning some streets, and constructing large museums and public buildings along the Mall's length. The commission also proposed significant expansion of the district's park system, the creation of a system of parkways, and major renovation and beautification of existing parks. Over the next few years, the President and Congress established several new agencies to supervise the <b>design,</b> <b>approval,</b> and construction of new buildings in the District of Columbia to carry out the McMillan Plan: The Commission of Fine Arts in 1910 to review and advise on the design of new structures, the Public Buildings Commission in 1916 to make recommendations regarding the construction of buildings to house federal agencies and offices, and the National Capital Parks and Planning Commission in 1924 to oversee planning for the District.|$|E
