40|$|In this Article, Professor Charles Collier traces out {{a general}} theory of precedential {{authority}} through historical sources. The Article focuses on three particularly influential views of precedent: Wambaugh 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>concept</b> of dictum, Oliphant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>concept</b> of stare decisis, and Goodhart 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>concept</b> of ratio decidendi.

The first doctrine, derived from humanistic thought, restricts-legal authority as narrowly {{as possible to the}} express terms of an original text. The second doctrine draws on the broad, generalizing tendencies of the empirical sciences and their corresponding conceptions of scientific authority. The two doctrines coexist in a state of essential tension, because legal principles can become non-precedential either by being too broad and general or by being too narrow and particularized...|$|R
