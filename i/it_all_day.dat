25|$|On 21 January 1943, Williams became head of XII Air Support Command, {{the ground}} support {{aircraft}} operating {{in support of}} II Corps on the Tunisian front. Nominally the XII Air Support Command had a strength of 52 P-40s, 23 P-39s, 27 A-20s and eight DB-7s. Williams' assumption of command coincided {{with an increase in}} German activity. Reacting to a concentration of German armor around Faïd, Williams' aircraft bombed and strafed <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> on 26 January, claiming twelve German tanks destroyed. However, German opposition was increasing in the air as well. On 2 February, six P-40s and four P-39s encountered twenty to thirty Stukas escorted by eight to ten Me 109s. A Stuka was shot down; but so were five P-40s. His most experienced group, the 33d Fighter Group took so many losses {{that it had to be}} withdrawn to Morocco to rebuild. Then reverses suffered by the ground forces in the Battle of the Kasserine Pass forced Williams to evacuate his forward airfields around Thélepte. Eighteen aircraft, of which five were irreparable, were destroyed to prevent their capture. On 22 and 23 February, Williams attempted to launch an all-out attack on German forces withdrawing through Kasserine Pass, but the weather hampered his efforts.|$|E
25|$|A Scheffler cooker (named {{after its}} inventor, Wolfgang Scheffler) uses a large ideally {{paraboloidal}} reflector which is rotated around an axis that is {{parallel with the}} earth's using a mechanical mechanism, turning at 15 degrees per hour {{to compensate for the}} earth's rotation. The axis passes through the reflector's centre of mass, allowing the reflector to be turned easily. The cooking vessel is located at the focus which is on the axis of rotation, so the mirror concentrates sunlight onto <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>day.</b> The mirror has to be occasionally tilted about a perpendicular axis to compensate for the seasonal variation in the sun's declination. This perpendicular axis does not pass through the cooking vessel. Therefore, if the reflector were a rigid paraboloid, its focus would not remain stationary at the cooking vessel as the reflector tilts. To keep the focus stationary, the reflector's shape has to vary. It remains paraboloidal, but its focal length and other parameters change as it tilts. The Scheffler reflector is therefore flexible, and can be bent to adjust its shape. It is often made up {{of a large number of}} small plane sections, such as glass mirrors, joined together by flexible plastic. A framework that supports the reflector includes a mechanism that can be used to tilt it and also bend it appropriately. The mirror is never exactly paraboloidal, but it is always close enough for cooking purposes.|$|E

500|$|Stewart, {{who earned}} $270,136 for the victory, {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} first win of the season, and his first at Talladega Superspeedway, {{in front of a}} crowd of 145,000. He was delighted to take the victory: [...] "It's one thing to get back to Victory Lane, but to do it at Talladega wow." [...] "I've wanted to win here for so long. This hasn't been one of my favorite places on the fan side. People haven't always liked me here. But this was for those guys up in the stands today." [...] Second-place finisher Menard was pleased with his result, saying he had a good car throughout the duration of the race: [...] "Car had speed in <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>day.</b> Didn't make any chassis adjustments, just did a little bit of air pressure after the first run to free it up. It was just all track position really." [...] In the post-race press conference, third-place finisher Ragan said that he felt that he had a car which could have secured the victory under the right circumstances, but believed it was a good day for his team: [...] "We always seem to be pretty fast here on the superspeedway track, so that just goes to show you how much effort our Roush Fenway team is putting into this program." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 10 March 1914, militant suffragette Mary Richardson {{walked into}} the National Gallery of London and {{attacked}} Diego Velázquez's painting Rokeby Venus with a meat cleaver. Her action was ostensibly provoked by the arrest of fellow suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day, although there had been earlier warnings of a planned attack on the collection. Richardson left seven slashes on the painting, {{all of which have}} been successfully repaired. Richardson was sentenced to six months imprisonment, the maximum allowed for destruction of an artwork. In a statement to the Women's Social and Political Union shortly afterwards, Richardson explained, [...] "I have tried to destroy the picture of {{the most beautiful woman in}} mythological history as a protest against the Government for destroying Mrs. Pankhurst, who is the most beautiful character in modern history".
