40|$|The European Market Coupling Company (EMCC) {{operates}} {{an interim}} tight volume coupling (ITVC) that implicitly allocates the interconnection capacities between Central West European (CWE) and Nordic (Nordpool) day-ahead electricity spot markets. Though {{it is to}} be replaced by a single price coupling in the near future, the volume coupling principle can still inspire pragmatic solutions for future challenges in other situations. In order to learn from the current experience, this paper offers elements of understanding on the interim volume coupling run by the EMCC that are not highlighted in the documents already available. In particular, a new analytical model of the tight volume coupling is developed to show that the ITVC principle would not generate any inefficiencies under three assumptions. This analysis thus offers a new perspective on the causality of adverse ow events. Furthermore, this model could be used to study other tight volume coupling mechanisms because it can be applied with minor modifications to any number of areas, other kinds of traded products or areas using a ow-based method. Learning from the ITVC experience, this paper proposes an example of improvement of the tight volume coupling method based on a stronger coordination between the numerical solvers. This improved mechanism could serve as an interim solution if a price coupling numerical solver does not provide satisfactory results because of the optimisation problem size or complexity. In this case, the proposed solution is expected to be a satisfactory <b>implicit</b> <b>allocation</b> <b>method</b> from both technical and governance points of view...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a power <b>allocation</b> <b>method</b> for the direct/cooperative amplify-and-forward (AF) relay {{switched}} SC-FDMA using spectrum division/adaptive subcarrier allocation (SDASA). The cooperative relaying is used {{only when it}} can achieve higher channel capacity than the direct communication. In the proposed power <b>allocation</b> <b>method,</b> transmit power is adaptively allocated to mobile terminal (MT) and relay station (RS) according to the channel conditions of MT-RS link and RS-base station (BS) link when the use of cooperative relay is selected. We evaluate the achievable channel capacity of the proposed power <b>allocation</b> <b>method</b> by Monte-Carlo numerical computation method. It is shown that the proposed power <b>allocation</b> <b>method</b> can achieve almost the same channel capacity as the grid search method.

A first-fit <b>allocation</b> <b>methods</b> allocates the incoming programs to the first free submesh it detects. A best-fit methods identifies several candidate submeshes, and the program is allocated to the best-fit candidate based on certain heuristic.

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} to allocate the system availability goal to reliability and maintainability goals of components in the early design phase. However, the networked system availability is difficult to be allocated due to its complex topology and multiple down states. To solve these problems, a practical availability <b>allocation</b> <b>method</b> is proposed. Network reliability algebraic methods are used to derive the availability expression of the networked topology on the system level, and Markov model is introduced to determine that on the component level. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to obtain the reliability and maintainability allocation values of components. The principles applied in the AGREE reliability <b>allocation</b> <b>method,</b> proposed by the Advisory Group on Reliability of Electronic Equipment, and failure rate-based maintainability <b>allocation</b> <b>method</b> persist in our <b>allocation</b> <b>method.</b> A series system is used to verify the new algorithm, and the result shows that the allocation based on the heuristic algorithm is quite accurate compared to the traditional one.

40|$|The {{application}} of this thesis compares three different manufacturing theories, varying on resource allocation, to decide which performs best. Three Resource <b>Allocation</b> <b>methods</b> are analyzed including a static resource <b>allocation</b> <b>method,</b> a semidynamic resource <b>allocation</b> <b>method,</b> and a dynamic resource <b>allocation</b> <b>method.</b> The last methodology used in this thesis develops a resource <b>allocation</b> <b>method</b> intended to display complex behavior.

A Theory of Constraints manufacturing model using the Theory of Constraints process represents a semi-dynamic resource allocation system. A Complex Adaptive System manufacturing model using autonomous agents represents a dynamic resource allocation system. The systems were analyzed at multiple stress levels for system to system performance, {{as well as for}} complex behavior. Dynamic resource allocation outperformed the semi-dynamic allocation and static allocation systems unilaterally.

40|$|M. Com. (Financial Economics) Abstract: The {{portfolio}} allocation {{problem is}} characterised by two factors; risk and expected return. This is mainly {{explained by the}} Markowitz (1952) mean-variance framework. The frequency and severity of recent financial crises {{has led to an}} increase in calls for improved asset <b>allocation</b> <b>methods</b> in the asset management industry. Asset allocation strategies should protect investor capital and result in higher relative returns in turbulent times. Modern portfolio theory has been heavily criticised (Lee, 2011; Roncalli, 2013) for failure to provide adequate diversification to protect fund managers during crises, hence the emergence of risk-based asset <b>allocation</b> <b>methods</b> that focus on portfolio construction based on risk and diversification. The crises led to poor performance of different portfolios and funds, especially those with high exposure to equities. Risk-based <b>allocation</b> <b>methods</b> try to achieve investors’ goals of safety and higher returns, irrespective of future market behaviour. Six risk-based asset allocation strategies were explored and contrasted; Equally weighted, Risk parity, Most Diversified, Minimum Correlation, Minimum variance and the Minimum CVaR portfolio. This was done in an effort to find the method which performs better when investors have different investment goals. Predicted risk measures were applied as inputs in these risk-based asset <b>allocation</b> <b>methods</b> (i. e. a forward looking approach was taken). The study focused on comparisons of the risk-based asset <b>allocation</b> <b>methods</b> using forwardlooking risk measures in the South African market. The main results of the study include the finding that risk-based asset <b>allocation</b> <b>methods</b> are effective in protecting investors’ capital and achieve higher returns than the market portfolio during crisis periods compared to other periods as expected. It was also found that the Minimum Correlation Portfolio performed better than all other risk-based asset allocation during the crisis period, which means it is the best risk-based asset <b>allocation</b> <b>method</b> to use during crisis periods in the South African market. There has not been a lot of studies on the perfomance of the Minimum Correlation Portfolio, and this result shows the need for a comprehensive study on all risk-based asset <b>allocation</b> <b>methods</b> in different countries/regions to determine which risk-based asset allocation technique is best for different regions...|$|R
