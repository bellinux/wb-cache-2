This term generally refers to testing and analysis focused on the quality and strength of the weld, but may refer to technological actions to check for the presence, position and extent of welds.

A few examples of destructive testing include macro etch testing, fillet-weld break tests, transverse tension tests, and <b>guided</b> <b>bend</b> tests. Other destructive methods include acid etch testing, back bend testing, tensile strength break testing, nick break testing, and free bend testing.

40|$|Tailoring the {{nanostructure}} of electrodeposited Al-Mn {{films to}} achieve high hardness and toughness is the overarching {{goal of this}} thesis. Binary Al-Mn alloys are electrodeposited using a conventional current waveform in a chloroaluminate electrolyte at ambient temperature. It is found that alloys with low Mn contents comprise micrometer-sized FCC grains. At intermediate Mn contents, the FCC grain size decreases abruptly to the nanometer regime upon {{the appearance of a}} secondary amorphous phase. In these dual-phase alloys, the phases are distributed in a characteristic domain-network structure. At high Mn contents, an amorphous phase that contains pre-existing nanoquasicrystalline nuclei dominates. Leveraging the effects of surface kinetics at the electrode on the alloy microstructure, a reverse-pulse current waveform is designed to tailor the grain size and phase distribution of the electrodeposits; single phase FCC alloys with nanocrystalline grains, as well as dual-phase alloys with homogeneous phase distribution are synthesized. Solute distributions in these alloys are investigated using atom probe tomography. Implanted Ga ions are used as chemical markers for the amorphous phase; this method permits more robust phase identification and measurement of their compositions. Whereas uniform Mn distributions are observed in the single phase alloys, Mn is found to weakly partition into amorphous phase of the dual-phase alloy by ~ 2 at. %. Micro-indentation of the reverse-pulsed alloys and the <b>guided</b> <b>bend</b> tests reveal high hardness and toughness that are comparable to steels. High hardness is attributed to a combination of solid-solution strengthening effects and structural refinement; high toughness of the nanostructured alloys arises from the activation of both grain boundary- and dislocation-mediated deformation mechanisms; malleability of the amorphous alloys stems from the simultaneous operation of multiple shear bands during deformation. An unprecedented combination of high hardness, toughness and lightweight is thus achieved in our electrodeposited Al-Mn alloys. by Shiyun Ruan. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|For {{purposes}} of analysis, the flow in a <b>guide</b> vane <b>bend</b> {{is divided into}} a basic or primary two-dimensional flow with superimposed secondary flow. The two-dimensional flow is reviewed briefly first.

The effect of the secondary flow on head loss {{can be divided into}} two parts. The first part causes a loss which can be measured immediately behind the vanes, while the second part causes a loss which occurs between the trailing edges of the vanes and a plane about 4 duct hydraulic diameters behind the miter line of the bend. The second part is considerably larger than the first and may be attributed to increased wall shear downstream of the vanes. The increased wall shear is, in turn, attributable to the redistribution of streamlines by the secondary flow...|$|R
40|$|In {{developing}} {{strategies of}} manipulating surface electromagnetic waves, {{it has been}} recently recognized that a complete forbidden band gap can exist in a periodic surface-wave photonic crystal, which has subsequently produced various surface-wave photonic devices. However, it is not obvious whether such a concept can be extended to a non-periodic surface-wave system that lacks translational symmetry. Here we experimentally demonstrate that a surface-wave photonic quasicrystal that lacks periodicity can also exhibit a forbidden band gap for surface electromagnetic waves. The lower cutoff of this forbidden band gap is mainly determined by the maximum separation between nearest neighboring pillars. Point defects within this band gap show distinct properties compared to a periodic photonic crystal {{for the absence of}} translational symmetry.

40|$|The {{design of}} a {{pneumatically}} actuated silicone module, resembling soft tissue, with three pneumatic chambers is considered and optimized in this study {{with the aim of}} using it in a soft robot arm for robotic surgery applications. Three types of silicone materials, Ecoflex 0030 and 0050 and Dragonskin 0030, have been investigated, and a constitutive model has been derived for each of them. Design optimization of the silicone module was based on finite element analysis (FEA) that was validated against experimental data of one-degree bending under one-channel actuation. This was followed by FEA parametric studies for module design optimization to minimize the ballooning effect in one-degree bending as well as reduce the actuation pressure. Modules made from Ecoflex 0030 and Ecoflex 0050 exhibited the same bending shape in FEA, but about three times higher actuation pressure was required for the harder Ecoflex 0050. Design parameters under investigation in the parametric FEA studies included the shape of the pneumatic channel cross section, the ratio of channel length to module length, the distance of channel from the module wall, and the ratio of channel to module cross-sectional area.

40|$|Incompressible flow in a <b>guide</b> vane <b>bend</b> may be {{considered}} as composed of a primary two-dimensional, nearly potential flow upon which is superimposed a secondary flow. The two-dimensional flow lies in {{the plane of the}} bend and is determined by the flow boundaries alone. If the flow entering a bend were everywhere irrotational, the two-dimensional flow pattern would be the three-dimensional pattern (nearly). Because the real flow entering a bend has a nonuniform velocity profile in planes normal to the plane of the bend, the streamlines in the nonuniform region are determined not alone by the flow boundaries but also by the entrance profile or vorticity. The main purpose of this research was the study of the influence of secondary flows on the basic two-dimensional flow. It is shown in the report from experimental data that the secondary flows have a negligible influence on the average deflection of the flow by the guide vanes, but they have a major influence on the energy loss. The two-dimensional loss coefficient is increased 100 per cent and more by the secondary flows. The loss attributable to secondary flows may be divided into two parts. The smaller of the two parts occurs at the vanes and the larger part occurs in a region downstream of the vanes extending over three or four duct hydraulic diameters. This larger part of the loss is attributed mainly to increased wall shear downstream of the vanes. The increased wall shear occurs because the secondary flow brings high-energy, high-velocity fluid to the duct wall from the interior.
