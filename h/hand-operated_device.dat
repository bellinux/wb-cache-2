40|$|This study investigates various methods {{by which}} a {{previously}} developed <b>hand-operated</b> actuated <b>device</b> is capable of measuring the mechanical impedance of both the compliant patient tissue in contact with its end effector and of {{the hand of the}} operator holding the device. The particular device being investigated is an actuated ultrasound probe originally designed to regulate the amount of force exerted by a sonographer to their patient during an ultrasound scan. We expect that quantifying the effective mechanical impedance of the operator hand will lead to improvements in the design and control of <b>hand-operated</b> <b>devices.</b> Improvements are being considered not only to improve the quality and reliability of the ultrasound scan, but to alleviate the chronic muscular and joint stress endured by sonographers over the course of their careers. An additional motivation behind this study is to augment the capabilities of physicians to diagnose medical conditions, such as breast cancer and liver cirrhosis, on the basis of tissue impedance without the need for an additional mechanism. Several methods were developed for approximating mechanical impedance using the actuated ultrasound probe, based on the sensors available and models of the device dynamics. Due to sensor limitations, impedance measurement could only be effectively implemented for a single interface, instead of both concurrently. These methods involved immobilizing one end of the device. Experiments were conducted on artificial tissues in order to confirm that the methods developed were valid and reliable for measuring mechanical impedance of the body in contact with either the sonographer or patient end of the device. by David Mercado.

40|$|AbstractThe {{wheelchair}} handrim is a {{key factor}} in the wheelchair ergonomics and has been shown to affect both user's comfort and propulsion efficiency. Since the handrim is used for both pushing and braking, friction is an important aspect influencing thermal comfort on hands. This study was aimed at investigating the influence of handrim design on hands’ temperature during manual wheelchair propulsion. Ten able-bodied subjects performed an “ 8 -shaped” propulsion protocol on a flat floor, repeated twice, each time with a different pair of handrims: the standard round metallic tube handrims, and the ergonomically designed handrims. Temperature on hands’ surface was measured with a thermographic camera at three moments: before starting the protocol and immediately after each protocol with a different handrim. The results show that the average maximum temperature on hands’ surface after propelling the wheelchair with the conventional handrims (36. 77 + 1. 66 oC) was significantly higher (p= 0. 01) than after propelling with the ergonomic handrim (36. 22 + 1. 33 oC). Measuring the temperature on hands with a thermographic camera was shown to be a useful technique to investigate thermal aspects of the <b>hand-operated</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

To harvest a set of tubers, the operator inserts a self-locking pair of serrated jaws into the cassava stem at about 4 to 6 inches above the ground.

40|$|Abstract The {{two-point}} discrimination (TPD) test {{is one of}} the most commonly used neurosensory tests to assess mechanoperception in the clinical settings. While there have been numerous studies of functional sensibility of the hand using TPD test, there have been relatively not enough reports on TPD in the orofacial region. Objective The aims of the present study were to determine the normal values of TPD in the six trigeminal sites (the forehead, cheek, mentum, upper lip, lower lip, and the tongue tip) and to investigate the effect of the site, sex, and test modality on the TPD perception. Material and Methods Forty healthy volunteers consisting of age-matched men (20) and women (20) with a mean age of 27. 1 years were recruited. One examiner performed the TPD test using a simple <b>hand-operated</b> <b>device,</b> i. e., by drawing compass with a blunt or sharp-pointed tip. The static TPD with a blunt-pointed tip (STPDB), moving TPD with a blunt-pointed tip (MTPDB), and static TPD with a sharp-pointed tip (STPDS) were measured. The predictors were the site, sex, and test modality, and the outcome variable was the TPD value. Three-way ANOVA was used for statistics. Results The analysis showed a significant effect of the site, sex and test modality on the TPD values. Significant differences between the test sites were observed with the descending order from the forehead and cheek>mentum>upper lip and lower lip>tongue tip and index finger. Women showed lower TPD values than those of men. The STPDS measurements were consistently lower than those of the STPDB and MTPDB. Conclusions The normal values of TPD in this study suggest that the cheek and forehead were less sensitive than other regions evaluated and women were more sensitive than men. The STPDS was the most sensitive test modality...|$|E

40|$|Diagnostic {{tests in}} resource-limited {{settings}} require {{technologies that are}} affordable and easy-to-use with minimal infrastructure. Colorimetric detection methods that provide results that are readable by eye, without reliance on specialized and expensive equipment, have great utility in these settings. Existing colorimetric methods based on enzymatic reactions and gold nanoparticles often produce results that must be read within a specified time interval to ensure their validity. In many instances, a user has to wait several minutes for the color to develop. Moreover, {{the result can be}} interpreted incorrectly because of low visual contrast. Therefore, a colorimetric detection technology that produces bright and unambiguous readout within a time interval of a few seconds to less than two minutes, and removes the burden of accurate time keeping from the user can be very beneficial in low-resource settings. Photo-initiated polymerization-based amplification (PBA) is a technology that allows detection of a surface-bound analyte through co-localization of a visible-light photoinitiator with the analyte present on the surface. In the presence of an appropriate dose of light and monomers, a subsequent free radical polymerization reaction results in formation of an interfacial hydrogel in areas where the initiator has been localized. In this thesis, we modified the eosin/tertiary amine-based PBA technology, which had previously been developed on transparent glass surfaces, for use with cellulose-based (paper) surfaces. Using Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein as an example, we showed that paper-based PBA allowed high-contrast visual detection of proteins with a limit-of-detection of single digit nM concentration (~ 7 nM) in complex matrices such as human serum and plasma purified from blood samples {{through the use of a}} <b>hand-operated</b> microfluidic <b>device.</b> The paper-based immunoassay required only 10 [mu]L sample per test and the total time for signal amplification, from illumination to colorimetric detection, was 2 - 2. 5 minutes per test. The method provided quantitative information regarding analyte levels when combined with cellphone-based imaging. It also allowed decoupling of the capture of analyte on the surface from the signal amplification and visualization steps. We showed that in comparison with enzymatic amplification methods and silver deposition on gold nanoparticles, PBA-based readout on paper was cheaper, easier to perceive at its limit-of-detection, and had the lowest incidence of false readouts due to timing errors. In addition to developing PBA for use in paper devices, we combined PBA with a dilution array approach for quantifying analyte levels by counting number of visible polymer spots on a biochip. We used an empirical design approach that did not depend on measurement of equilibrium and kinetic binding parameters of the antibodies used in the assay and provided a dynamic range of three orders of magnitude, 70 pM to 70 nM, for visual quantification of the analyte. We also built a portable, light-weight, and customizable LED-based device with automated timer functionality for use with PBA assays in point-of-care settings. by Shefali Lathwal. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|New Zealand is {{situated}} on {{the boundary between the}} Pacific and Australian tectonic plates. The Wellington region lies near {{the southern end of the}} Hikurangi subduction zone and within a zone of major, active strike-slip faults. Wellington's paleoseismic and historic records indicate that large surface rupture earthquakes have occurred on these faults in the past. Development of a complete record of past large earthquakes is a high priority for the region because of the risk posed by occurrence of large earthquakes in the future. The existing paleoseismic record has been derived predominantly from studies of fault trench stratigraphy, raised beach ridges and offset river terraces. The sedimentary record of lakes and coastal waterbodies is a source of information that has not been used specifically for paleoseismic purposes in the region. Therefore investigation of Wellington's sedimentary record is used in this thesis to make a contribution to the paleoseismic record. Holocene sedimentary sequences are studied from three small, low elevation, coastal waterbodies: Taupo Swamp, Okupe Lagoon and Lake Kohangapiripiri. Sequences of between 200 and 650 cm depth were collected using a <b>hand-operated</b> coring <b>device.</b> Sedimentology and diatom microfossil content were analysed and interpreted to enable reconstruction of paleoenvironment at each site. Radiocarbon dating was used to provide chronologies for the sequences that are aged between 5000 and 7500 calibrated years before present (cal. years BP). Diatom analysis is the main tool used to reconstruct paleoenvironment and detect evidence for occurrence of past large earthquakes. To aid reconstruction of sedimentary sequences used in this project, as well as coastal sequences in New Zealand in general, a coastal diatom calibration set was constructed using 50 sites around New Zealand. Modern diatom distribution and abundance, and associated environmental variables are analysed using ordination and weighted averaging techniques. Detrended correspondence analysis arranges species according to salinity preferences and divides sites clearly into waterbody types along a coastal gradient. This analysis enables reconstruction of waterbody type from fossil samples by passive placement onto ordination diagrams. Weighted averaging regression of calibration set samples results in a high correlation (r 2 jack= 0. 84) between observed and diatom inferred salinity, and enables salinity preferences and tolerances to be derived for 100 species. This confirms for the first time that species' preferences derived in the Northern Hemisphere are generally applicable to diatoms living in the coastal zone of New Zealand. Weighted averaging calibration and the modern analogue technique are used to generate quantitative estimates of paleosalinity for fossil samples. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions of Taupo Swamp, Okupe Lagoon and Lake Kohangapiripiri indicate that each waterbody has been isolated from the sea during the late Holocene. Isolation has been achieved through interplay of sediment accumulation causing growth of barrier beaches, and coseismic uplift. Ten distinct transitions between different paleoenvironments are recognised from the three sequences. These transitions involve changes in relative sea level or water table level often in association with catchment disturbance or marine influx events. All transitions occur suddenly and are laterally extensive and synchronous within each waterbody. Quantitative estimates of paleosalinity and waterbody type are used to differentiate between large and small magnitude changes in paleoenvironment. Five transitions involve large amounts of paleoenvironmental change and provide evidence for earthquakes occurring at approximately 5200, approximately 3200, and approximately 2300 cal. years BP. Five other transitions are consistent with the effects of large earthquakes occurring at approximately 6800, 2200, approximately 1000, approximately 500 cal. years BP and 1855 AD but do not provide independent evidence of the events. Environmental transitions at Lake Kohangapiripiri clarify the timing of rupture of the Wairarapa Fault by bracketing incompatible age estimates derived from two different sites on the fault. The oldest environmental transitions recognised at Taupo Swamp and Okupe Lagoon both occur at approximately 3200 cal. years BP indicating that western Wellington was uplifted at this time. Environmental transitions are recorded at all three study sites at approximately 2300 cal. years BP indicating that the entire western and central Wellington region experienced coseismic uplift at this time. Because of the distance between sites this apparent synchroneity implies that several faults in the region ruptured at a similar time. Investigation of sedimentary sequences contributes to the existing paleoseismic record by providing additional estimates of timing for past large earthquakes, enabling estimation of the areal extent of the effects of past earthquakes, and by highlighting periods of fault rupture activity in the late Holocene...|$|R
