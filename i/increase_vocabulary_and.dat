40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{study investigated}} the efficacy of a supplementary preschool embedded multimedia curriculum {{that was designed to}} increase one type of conceptual knowledge: taxonomic categories. Named the World of Words (WOW), this curriculum focused on teaching the properties and concepts associated with seven taxonomic categories and providing children with the vocabulary that is paired with these concepts. Participants were 178 low-income preschoolers (89 in the treatment group, 89 in the comparison group) taught by twelve preschool teachers. Six teachers implemented the supplementary curriculum with children in their classrooms four times per week for four months. The other six teachers went about their typical daily routines with for those four months, thus acting as a comparison group. Children in both the treatment and comparison groups were assessed on their conceptual knowledge and vocabulary knowledge before the study began, immediately following instruction around each taxonomic category, and {{at the conclusion of the}} study. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) was used to analyze data from these assessments. Findings indicated that children who experienced the curriculum acquired both the vocabulary and underlying concepts that were taught in the curriculum. In addition, they were able to transfer the conceptual knowledge they acquired to new learning situations, an initial indication that learning vocabulary embedded within the concept of taxonomic categories has the power to foster future learning. However, four months of this type of instruction was not sufficient to increase the growth of general receptive or expressive vocabulary knowledge. Results from this study support the notion that teaching conceptual knowledge and vocabulary in taxonomic categories is a powerful way to <b>increase</b> <b>vocabulary</b> <b>and</b> conceptual knowledge before children enter formal schooling...|$|E

Research on brain development indicates that babies learn best by having salient experiences and interacting with their caregivers (Gopnik, Meltzoff, & Kuhl, 1999). Because of the possibility that some positive language learning can occur due to media viewing, more research is needed in this area with a focus on very young children. There is an abundance of information available about the positive relationship between vocabulary and home literacy routines (Foy & Mann, 2003; Senechal, LeFevre, Thomas, & Daley, 1998; van Kleck, 2006). Research is needed comparing the increase in vocabulary that occurs as a result of viewing baby media with that of shared book reading. Twelve children (12 - 30 months) were assigned to one of three groups during this 4 -week study. Each week, Group 1 watched a 10 minute segment of a DVD “edutainment” program targeted at this young age group. Group 2 parents read books to their child for the same amount of time as the DVD group. Books were the DVD companions and covered the same vocabulary terms as the DVD.

The research-based training consisted ofthree sequential, teamtraining events spaced six months apart and with six days of onsite coaching following each training (a total of 18 days of follow-up.). The dialogic reading strategies were used to promote rapid and substantial growth in language skills in young children that are key to literacy development. The training model was developed from a wide body of research on effective training and knowledge transfer including: training over time, a focus on specific strategies and time to practice, and onsite coaching and follow-up support. Findings suggest caregivers and family members who attended the training significantly increased their use of two of the three targeted strategies.

For this reason {{many of these students}} have a delay in Dutch language, which stands in the way of their school performance.

The second aim is to gain more insight of the four interventions. Besides that, suggestions to improve the interventions are given. Method: 49 students (age 9 - 11) and their intervention teachers took part in this research. Data were collected using interviews for qualitative data, and the PPVT (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test), Raven SPM (Standard Progressive Matrices) and TBL (Toets Begrijpend Lezen) were used to collect quantitative data. An ANCOVA and ANOVA had been done to analyze the quantitative data.

In collecting the data, the writer uses observation and document. Observation is an activity in a certain situation to get the data {{about the process of}} teaching vocabulary by using outdoor activities. Document is instrument to collect the data lesson plan. The process about of teaching vocabulary by using outdoor activities is: (1) Before the teacher introduces the new English vocabulary, the students are in the class with the teacher, and then the teacher informs the new English vocabulary that are suitable with the topic in English and the students listen it. (2) Together with the teacher, they go to the location to school’s yard. (3) in that location, the teacher will say the things that are suitable with the topic (tree, flower, leaf, grass) (4) The students will also pronounce the word then try to memorize it. (5) After the students know word and know how to pronounce the word. (6) When the lesson is over, the students go back to the class together with the teacher. After collecting data and analyzing them, the writer presented the result of the research. The strength of this method is the students can easily <b>increase</b> their <b>vocabulary</b> <b>and</b> loose their boredom in studying English.

The language of mathematics must be explicitly taught through direct and focused instruction to promote the vocabulary development of students. The level of student self-efficacy in mathematics has been demonstrated to relate in a cyclical way to academic achievement; if one was to improve, so would the other. The purpose of this project was to explore connections between self-efficacy, <b>vocabulary</b> development, <b>and</b> student academic achievement. A self-efficacy questionnaire, Math and Me, was created that teachers could implement multiple times throughout a learning period. The results could be used to determine the growth of student self-efficacy after focused and direct instruction of vocabulary clarification. Use of the Collaborative Four-Square Frayer Model presented in this paper, in conjunction with the Vocabulary Instruction Implications for Teacher Practice guide, should increase student self-efficacy in math classes by providing resources to teachers that would aid in the instruction of mathematical vocabulary. To deepen student vocabulary knowledge, it would be essential for students to have experienced multiple and repeated opportunities for meaningful engagement with new mathematical <b>vocabulary.</b> <b>Increases</b> in student achievement have been linked separately to both <b>increased</b> <b>vocabulary</b> acquisition <b>and</b> <b>increased</b> levels of self-efficacy; the foundation of this project was built on the notion that a relationship must therefore exist between <b>vocabulary</b> knowledge <b>and</b> mathematical self-efficacy...|$|R

The central question addressed in this paper is how best to teach new vocabulary items to these children. Aims: To investigate the effects of two different methods of teaching vocabulary on both <b>vocabulary</b> knowledge <b>and</b> reading comprehension. Methods & Procedures: Twenty-four children (aged 7 – 8 years) with poor existing vocabulary knowledge took part in an intervention study. Half the children were taught new vocabulary items using definitions; the other half were taught a strategy for deriving meanings from written context. Tests of vocabulary knowledge were given before teaching, immediately after teaching and 3 months later. Outcomes & Results: Immediately after teaching, both groups had improved equivalently in vocabulary knowledge for the taught words. However, 3 months later, the context group showed significantly better expressive vocabulary knowledge. The context group went on to show significantly better comprehension of text containing a number of the taught words and demonstrated that they could use the newly acquired strategy independently to derive meanings from written context. Conclusions: The context method developed is effective in <b>increasing</b> <b>vocabulary</b> knowledge <b>and</b> improving reading comprehension in children with poor existing <b>vocabulary</b> knowledge, <b>and</b> this is therefore recommended for use with children who require extra help developing <b>vocabulary</b> <b>and</b> comprehension skills...|$|R
