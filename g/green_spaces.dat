40|$|Abstract Background Lack of {{physical}} activity (PA) is a growing public health concern. There is {{a growing body of}} literature that suggests a positive relationship may exist between the amount of local <b>green</b> <b>space</b> near one’s home and PA levels. For instance, park proximity has been shown to predict PA levels amongst certain populations. However, there is little evidence for the role of relatedness towards nature and perceptions of local <b>green</b> <b>space</b> on this relationship. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine, in a National UK sample, whether subjective indices associated with local <b>green</b> <b>space</b> were better predictors of visit frequency to local <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and PA levels compared to objectively measured quantity of local <b>green</b> <b>space.</b> Methods A cross-sectional survey was designed. From a random sample, 2079 working age adults responded to an online survey in September 2011. Demographics, self-reported PA, objective measures of the local environment (including local <b>green</b> <b>space,</b> road coverage, and environmental deprivation), were assessed in conjunction with perceptions of local <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and nature relatedness. Quantity of local <b>green</b> <b>space</b> was assessed by cross-referencing respondents’ home postcodes with general land use databases. Regression models were conducted to assess which of our independent variables best predicted visit frequency to local <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and/or meeting PA guidelines. In addition, an ordinal regression was run to examine the relationship between visit frequency to local <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and the likelihood of meeting national PA guidelines. Results Nature relatedness was the strongest predictor for both visit frequency to local <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and meeting PA guidelines. Results show that perceived quality is a better predictor of visit frequency to local <b>green</b> <b>space</b> than objective quantity of local <b>green</b> <b>space.</b> The odds of achieving the recommended amount of PA was over four times greater for people who visited local <b>green</b> <b>space</b> once per week compared to never going (OR 4. 151; 95  % CI, 2. 40 to 7. 17). Conclusions These results suggest that perceptions of local <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and nature relatedness play an important role in the relationship between local <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and PA.

This study aimed to determine whether exposure to <b>green</b> <b>space</b> during pregnancy is associated with less depression, and whether this association is moderated by relevant factors, such as age, education, self-identified ethnicity, physical activity, residential rurality, and socioeconomic status. Methods: Health data were sourced from the cohort study “Growing Up in New Zealand” comprised of 6772 participants. <b>Green</b> <b>space</b> was estimated based on the proportion of <b>green</b> <b>space</b> within the Census Area Unit. Adjusted logistic mixed effect models were used to investigate the association between <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and antenatal depression after controlling for confounding variables. Results: Maternal exposure to <b>green</b> <b>space</b> were not associated with lower odds of antenatal depression. Indications of effect modifications due to relevant factors were not observed. Conclusions: This study did not determine an association between access to <b>green</b> <b>space</b> (measured based on {{the distance to the}} nearest <b>green</b> <b>space)</b> and antenatal depression. Therefore, a link between <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and antenatal depression was not established.

40|$|Background: Exposure to <b>green</b> <b>space</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with increased physical activity.

Relationships between exposure to <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and physical activity during pregnancy are not well defined. Our objective was to determine whether exposure to <b>green</b> <b>space</b> was associated with physical activity in pregnant women. Methods: The current study was completed within the Growing Up in New Zealand cohort study of 6772 pregnant women. The proportion of <b>green</b> <b>space</b> in each census area unit was determined and geocoded to residential address. The association between exposure to <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and physical activity was determined using logistic regression analyses after controlling for confounding variables. Results: Exposure to <b>green</b> <b>space</b> was not associated with participation in physical activity during first trimester and the remainder of pregnancy once preference for living in greener neighborhoods was taken into account. Conclusions: The lack of association between <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and physical activity found in this study does not necessarily mean that living in <b>green</b> <b>space</b> will not translate into better pregnancy health.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide a robust understanding of the magnitude and direction of effect of urban <b>green</b> <b>space</b> on human health outcomes. This relationship has been studied using a variety of health and <b>green</b> <b>space</b> measures and multiple approaches to collect health data. Due to the various approaches used to study the relationship between <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and health, it is difficult to clearly understand the general relationship. In order to have a robust and clear understanding of the relationship between <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and human health, it is necessary to do a meta-analysis that considers all the approaches to assessing <b>green</b> <b>space,</b> health, and health data. Overall, the average estimated effect shows that surrounding urban <b>green</b> <b>space</b> improves human health by 1. 14 fold (~u= 0. 13 (95 % CI: (0. 07 - 0. 19)). The magnitude of effect increased when accounting for perceived health and when using greenness as the urban <b>green</b> <b>space</b> measure (~u= 0. 29 (95 % CI: (- 0. 06 - 0. 63)).

5|$|The North End Halifax {{neighbourhood}} of Richmond {{bore the}} brunt of the explosion. In 1917, Richmond was considered a working-class neighbourhood and had few paved roads. After the explosion, the Halifax Relief Commission approached the reconstruction of Richmond as an opportunity to improve and modernize the city's North End. English town planner Thomas Adams and Montreal architectural firm Ross and Macdonald were recruited to design a new housing plan for Richmond. Adams, inspired by the Victorian garden city movement, aimed to provide public access to <b>green</b> <b>spaces</b> and to create a low-rise, low-density and multifunctional urban neighbourhood. The planners designed 326 large homes that each faced a tree-lined, paved boulevard. They specified that the homes be built with a new and innovative fireproof material, blocks of compressed cement called Hydrostone. The first of these homes was occupied by March 1919. Once finished, the Hydrostone neighbourhood consisted of homes, businesses and parks, which helped create a new sense of community in the North End of Halifax. It has now become an upscale neighbourhood and shopping district. In contrast, the equally poor and underdeveloped area of Africville was not included in reconstruction efforts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{mounting}} international evidence {{that exposure to}} green environments is associated with health benefits, including lower mortality rates.

Possible causative mechanisms behind the <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and health relationship include the provision of physical activity opportunities, facilitation of social contact and the restorative effects of nature. In the New Zealand context we investigated whether there was a socioeconomic gradient in <b>green</b> <b>space</b> exposure and whether <b>green</b> <b>space</b> exposure was associated with cause-specific mortality (cardiovascular disease and lung cancer). We subsequently asked what is the mechanism(s) by which <b>green</b> <b>space</b> availability may influence mortality outcomes, by contrasting health associations for different types of <b>green</b> <b>space.</b> Methods This was an observational study on a population of 1, 546, 405 living in 1009 small urban areas in New Zealand.

40|$|The {{shortest}} {{summary of}} the thesis is in its title “Vitamin G”, where the G stands for the <b>green</b> <b>space</b> around us and Vitamin stands for the possible positive relationship between <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and people’s health. In {{the first part of}} this thesis we investigate whether <b>green</b> <b>space</b> in people’s living environment is positively related to their health. We found that <b>green</b> <b>space</b> is related to perceived general health as well as to morbidity. People with more <b>green</b> <b>space</b> in their living environment feel healthier and less often visit the General Practitioner with complaints like depression, diabetes and COPD. In the second part of this thesis we investigate whether the relation between <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and health can be explained by mechanisms related to exposure and behaviour. Concerning exposure, we examined, the extent to which the presence of <b>green</b> <b>space</b> close to and further away from the home can buffer the adverse impact of stressful life events on self-reported general, mental and physical health. The results indicate that <b>green</b> <b>space</b> within the wider living environment acts as a buffer against the adverse impact of stressful life events on self-reported physical health. Regarding behaviour, we investigated whether physical activity and social contacts are possible mechanisms behind the relation between <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and health. However, physical activity does not seem to be a mechanism behind the relation between <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and health. People with more <b>green</b> <b>space</b> in their living environment did not more or less often meet the Dutch public health recommendations for physical activity. Social contacts, on the other hand, partly and in some cases even completely mediated the relation between <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and health. People with more <b>green</b> <b>space</b> in their living environment feel less lonely and less often experience a shortage of social support. In the third part of the thesis, we investigated the relationship between the amount of <b>green</b> <b>space</b> in the living environment and feelings of social safety. The results suggest that the amount of <b>green</b> <b>space</b> in people’s living environment is generally positively associated with enhanced feelings of social safety. Only in very strongly urban areas the amount of <b>green</b> <b>space</b> in the living environment was found to be negatively associated with feelings of social safety. In the last part of the thesis we investigated whether the health benefits of <b>green</b> <b>space</b> are used in health care settings. More specifically, we investigated the extent to which general practitioners advise patients on physical activity and whether they refer to the additional health benefits of physical activity in a natural environment. Although advice on physical activity was given by general practitioners during 26 % of all consultations, the additional benefits of physical activity in natural environments were not mentioned by GPs during any of the consultations. This part of the thesis shows that there are opportunities to increase the use of <b>green</b> <b>space</b> in the health care sector...|$|R
