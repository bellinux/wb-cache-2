500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Sapochnik was also asked {{about how he}} went about {{creating}} a sense of emotion in the 'King in the North' scene, saying [...] "It wasn't hard. I think as fans we'd been waiting for <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>so</b> long. That said, {{it was a very}} difficult scene to shoot. Mainly because it was unusually hot over the two days we shot it, everyone was wearing heavy furs and armor, Kit was actually pretty ill and everyone was crammed into this space full of plates of sheep's tongues and chicken carcasses so it got quite smelly and sticky. It's also quite a long scene and yet Bella did it probably more than a hundred times, only forgetting a line once in the entire time. When we finished the scene she got a standing ovation from all the cast and crew." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{part of an}} {{extensive}} advertising campaign, [...] Reynolds discussed {{taking part in the}} production of a nude scene. The scene was filmed in a period of three days, and took approximately twelve takes to complete. Expressing that she was initially nervous, Bullock stated in an interview with Sky News that [...] "when everyone else acts like it's just a normal day it really helps you relax." [...] Although she revealed that producers provided them with fig leaves, Bullock stated that they would continuously fall off. She added, [...] "You could literally see everything." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Reynolds, who in an interview with People, stated, [...] "Filming a scene that involves being entirely naked and takes a couple days can be a little awkward." [...] He continued: [...] "Thankfully you're there for so long and you're doing <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>so</b> long that you dispense with the awkwardness pretty quickly and start to have mundane, normal conversations – the difference being you're not wearing pants." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a conference}} call with reporters on August 21, 2012, Daniels {{announced}} that this would be the final season of the series. Daniels said, [...] "This year feels like the last chance to really go out together and make an artistic ending for the show that pays off {{a lot of the stuff}} that matters most to fans." [...] Daniels also said all the questions would be answered, such as who was behind the documentary, and why they had been filming <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>so</b> long, as well as the reveal of the Scranton Strangler. A central point during the season was the romance between Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Pete Miller (Jake Lacy). According to Michael Ausiello of TVLine, the nature of their relationship was heavily debated by the writers and producers; he noted that [...] "the triangle [...] has stirred up a number of debates in the writers room, which tells me even they don't know at this point which guy Erin will choose." [...] Daniels consulted with Kemper and asked for her input, as he felt she had the best understanding of Erin's characterization.|$|E

500|$|Rivera's cut fastball was a {{respected}} pitch among major league hitters. Jim Thome called it [...] "the single best pitch {{ever in the}} game". David Ortiz echoed his sentiment, saying, [...] "His cutter was the single best pitch I've ever seen, but the really amazing thing is how {{he was able to}} do <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>so</b> many years. Are there guys now who have stuff as nasty as Mariano? Maybe for one year, two years. But nobody could maintain it like he did." [...] In 2004, ESPN.com ranked his cutter as the best [...] "out pitch" [...] in baseball. Olney described his cut fastball as [...] "the most dominant pitch of a generation". Although switch-hitters usually bat left-handed against right-handed pitchers to better see the ball's release point, switch-hitters occasionally batted right-handed when facing the right-handed Rivera to avoid being jammed on their hands by his cutter. Similarly, some managers, such as Bruce Bochy in the 1998 World Series, sent right-handed batters to pinch hit for left-handers [...] against Rivera, thinking that the cutter would be more difficult for lefties to hit. Opposing hitters occasionally chose to face Rivera with backup or batting practice bats, rather than risk their best bats being broken by his cutter.|$|E

[...] The company visited Denmark in 1970, Rome in 1974, and gave its last American tours in 1976 and 1978. [...] Its last tour, in [...] Australasia, {{conducted}} by the company's new musical director, Fraser Goulding, was a success in 1979. [...] Throughout the 20th century, until 1982, the company toured, on average, for 35 weeks per year (in addition to its 13-week London seasons), fostering a [...] "strong family atmosphere, reinforced {{by the number of}} marriages in the company and {{the fact that so many}} people stayed with <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>so</b> long." [...] Principal soprano Valerie Masterson married the company's principal flautist, Andrew March. [...] She explained, [...] "people didn't have flats or houses ... touring was your life." [...] Throughout its history, the company maintained strict moral standards, and it was sometimes referred to as the [...] "Savoy boarding school", enforcing policies regarding behaviour on and off stage, and even a dress code. [...] Soprano Cynthia Morey ascribed the strong affection that artists had for the company to [...] "the unique family atmosphere engendered by the company's direct descent from its creators, Gilbert, Sullivan ... Richard D'Oyly Carte, followed by his widow, Helen, his son Rupert, and finally his granddaughter Bridget." [...] The company also preserved, for over a century, what The Times called a [...] "unique performance style, which may be summarised as a combination of good taste and good fun".|$|E
500|$|Second unit filming {{began on}} 18 January 1997 with Vic Armstrong directing; they filmed the pre-credits {{sequence}} at Peyresourde Airport in the French Pyrenees, {{and moved on}} to Portsmouth to film the scenes where the Royal Navy prepares to engage the Chinese. The main unit began filming on 1 April. They were unable to use the Leavesden Film Studios, which they had constructed from an abandoned Rolls-Royce factory for GoldenEye, as George Lucas was using <b>it</b> <b>for</b> , <b>so</b> instead they constructed sound stages in another derelict industrial site nearby. They also used the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios. The scene at the [...] "U.S. Air Base in the South China Sea" [...] where Bond hands over the GPS encoder was actually filmed in the area known as Blue Section at RAF Lakenheath. The sea landing used the vast tank built for Titanic in Rosarito, Baja California, Mexico. The MH-53J in the film was from the US Air Force's 352d Special Operations Group at RAF Mildenhall. Some scenes were planned to be filmed on location in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and the production had been granted a visa. This was later rescinded, two months after planning had begun, forcing filming to move to Bangkok, Thailand. Bond spokesman Gordon Arnell claimed the Vietnamese were unhappy with crew and equipment needed for pyrotechnics, with a Vietnamese official saying it was due to [...] "many complicated reasons". Two locations from previous Bond films were used: Brosnan and Hatcher's love scene was filmed at Stoke Park, which had been featured in Goldfinger, and the bay where they search for Carver's stealth boat is Phang Nga Bay, Thailand, previously used for The Man with the Golden Gun.|$|E

Saunders was quoted as saying: [...] "Joanna Lumley kept announcing it and saying, 'Yes she's going to do it,' and then Dawn French on our radio show at Christmas said, 'I bet £100,000 that you don't write it,' so now I have to write it, otherwise I have to pay her £100,000'" [...] In April 2014, Saunders again confirmed on BBC Breakfast {{that she was in}} the process of writing the film, and gave a prospective release date of sometime during 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Owing to {{the success}} of [...] "The Sign of the Rose," [...] Beban was cast for most of the next decade in Italian {{character}} roles. [...] In 1917, Beban revealed to a reporter the irony that he could not speak a word of Italian. [...] Beban explained:"I understand the tongue when it is spoken – I couldn't be associated with <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>so</b> many years and not recognize and translate it – but I have never attempted to talk it myself. ... To portray the type of Italian that I do all one needs is knowledge of the actions, mannerisms, etc., of the character. [...] Not knowing the language, from the viewpoint that the Italian speaks it, I am thus able to make my characterization more understandable to the American audience. [...] In other words, I Americanize him for the United States consumption – stage purposes." ...|$|E

[...] The United States does not have a DVD boxed set of Kill Bill, though box sets of the two separate volumes are available in other countries, such as France, Japan and the United Kingdom. Upon the DVD release of Volume 2 in the US, however, Best Buy did offer an exclusive box set slipcase to house the two individual releases together. Volume 1, along with Volume 2, was released in High Definition on Blu-ray on September 9, 2008 in the United States.|$|E
