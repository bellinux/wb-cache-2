50|$|In first {{generation}} seed orchards, the parents usually are phenotypically-selected trees. In advanced generation seed orchards, the seed orchards are harvesting the benefits generated by tree breeding {{and the parents}} may be selected among the tested clones or families. It is efficient to synchronise the productive live cycle of the seed orchards with the cycle time of the breeding population. In the seed orchard, the trees can be arranged in a design to keep the related individuals or cloned copies apart from each other.Seed orchards are the delivery vehicle for genetic improvement programs where the trade-off between <b>genetic</b> <b>gain</b> and diversity {{is the most important}} concern. The <b>genetic</b> <b>gain</b> of seed orchard crops depends primarily on the genetic superiority of the orchard parents, the gametic contribution to the resultant seed crops, and pollen contamination from outside seed orchards.|$|E
40|$|How {{we should}} manage genetic {{diversity}} depends on why {{we want to}} manage it. The most generally useful strategy is to maintain variation across the genome, using methods that consider one or more of: population size, population structure, animal selections, mate allocations and information from genetic markers. A key reason to maintain genetic diversity is to facilitate longer-term <b>genetic</b> <b>gains,</b> and this means that most breeding programs need to consider genetic diversity as well as shorter-term <b>genetic</b> <b>gains.</b> This paper discusses these issues, and presents developments in methods to integrate <b>genetic</b> <b>gains,</b> <b>genetic</b> diversity and other issues within breeding programs...|$|R

50|$|Seed {{production}} and gene diversity {{is an important}} aspect when using improved materials like seed orchard crops. Seed orchards crops derive generally from {{a limited number of}} trees. But if it is a common wind-pollinated species much pollen will come from outside the seed orchard and widen the genetic diversity. The <b>genetic</b> <b>gain</b> of the first generation seed orchards is not great and the seed orchard progenies overlap with unimproved material. Gene diversity of the seed crops is greatly influenced by the relatedness (kinship) among orchard parents, the parental fertility variation, and the pollen contamination.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{argue that}} animal-{{breeding}} schemes need well-designed breeding plans to maximise long-term <b>genetic</b> <b>gains</b> from genomic information. Genomic {{information has been}} implemented in livestock breeding schemes with ad hoc breeding plans, suggesting that {{the potential benefits of}} genomic information are not being fully exploited. Breeding schemes need well-designed breeding plans to exploit the benefits of genomic information for two reasons. First, there are several components of breeding schemes with genomic information that impact on long-term <b>genetic</b> <b>gains.</b> Second, these components interact, which implies that breeding schemes need to optimise components simultaneously in order to maximise long-term <b>genetic</b> <b>gains.</b> Designing breeding plans that optimise components simultaneously is a complex task. In more cases than not, breeding schemes, their components, and interactions between these components do not allow optimum breeding plans to be designed by mere reasoning. We recommend using decision frameworks to design breeding plans for schemes that use genomic information: testing sound hypotheses by designing and executing controlled experiments using decision tools, such as mathematical–statistical models. These decision frameworks enable us to design optimum breeding plans by providing an objective and theoretical basis to make and validate breeding decisions, enabling us to understand the underlying mechanisms of breeding schemes with genomic information, and allowing us to test the practical implementation of breeding decisions against theoretical models. Genomic information is an exciting prospect for animal breeding, and there is clearly an important role for breeding plans that maximise long-term <b>genetic</b> <b>gains</b> in breeding schemes using genomic information...|$|R

50|$|X. sulcatipes {{are known}} {{to take part in}} altruistic behavior. These {{behaviors}} may be attributed to guarding, and the concessions received from undisturbed broods. A benefit from partaking in such a behavior where the guards are related to the mother bee is that this increases the bee's indirect fitness when they help kin because that helps propagate some small portion of the bee's genes. The guarding behavior of X. sulcatipes {{is similar to that of}} Xylocopa pubescens. However, unrelated guards don't receive much <b>genetic</b> <b>gain.</b> This is because unrelated workers that help guard do not share any common genes with the queen whom is the breeder, and therefore can't pass on genes they share in common.|$|E
5000|$|The optimal {{balance between}} the {{effective}} number of clones (diversity, status number, gene diversity) and <b>genetic</b> <b>gain</b> is achieved by making clonal contributions (number of ramets) proportional (linearly dependent) to the genetic value ("linear deployment"). This is dependent on several assumptions, one of them that the contribution to the seed orchard crop {{is proportional to the}} number of ramets. But the more ramets the larger the share of the pollen is lost depending on ineffective self-pollination. But even considering this, the linear deployment is a very good approximation. It was thought that increasing the gain is always accompanied by a loss in effective number of clones, but it has shown that both can be obtained in the same time by genetic thinning using the linear deployment algorithm if applied to some rather unbalanced seed orchards. Relatedness among clones is more critical for diversity than inbreeding.|$|E
5000|$|Because A. maculosum is {{a solitary}} bee, males {{do not go}} and look for {{emerging}} females. In addition, because females are dispersed widely, this {{makes it more difficult}} for males to find emerging females. He arrives at the resource first and lets the females come to him. The male takes part in polygyny to maximize fertilization because males have little <b>genetic</b> <b>gain</b> when mating with females. Therefore, males will mate with multiple females in hopes that this will increase the probability of propagating the male's genes. [...] Sometimes, a male will emit a pheromone in order to attract a female to his flower or territory. A male normally hovers around his territory but when he detects a female, he will stop flying and hover. The male waits for a female A. maculosum to land on a flower and then he quickly charges at her. He grabs her and lands on her back. If he is successful in grabbing her, he will proceed to rub the female’s head and thorax with his fore- and midlegs. Next, he falls back on the female and pokes her with his genital claspers before starting copulation. Copulation lasts for about 20-25 seconds, and then the female starts to fight back by moving and kicking. The pair then separates.|$|E

5000|$|The Lacaune {{has been}} used as a milking sheep in France for a very long time, but milking wasn't the {{dominant}} feature of the breed until recently. In the late 1960s, the average milk yield per ewe was only about 70 liters during the human milking period (and excluding the lamb suckling period) per annum. Remarkably, by the late 1990s the milk yield had quadrupled to 280 liters per annum. The Lacaune is now one of the world's high-yielding milk breeds. This was the result of a large-scale, rigorous selection program organized by a French government agency, which included artificial insemination of several million ewes over the years, and a vast array of government support for recording the performance of the progeny on many farms with respect to the milk yield and other outcomes; and improved knowledge about animal management and nutrition for sheep milk production; and the willingness of many farmers to participate in the program and take advantage of what was being learned. The combination of these and other factors brought about an improvement of 6.3% per year in milk yield per ewe in the breed over the 30-year period. The 6.3% gain is decomposable to [...] "a phenotypic gain of 3.9% (better management and nutrition) and a <b>genetic</b> <b>gain</b> of 2.4%.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate 44 soybean octuple crosses in the F 4 : 3 [8] and F 5 : 3 [8] generations in order to select progenies superior for seed oil yield (OY) and other important agronomic characteristics. Octuple crosses were hybridized in a chain mating system. In one group, crosses were carried out for three generations with the adapted x exotic parents until octuple crosses with 75 % adapted genes and 25 % exotic genes were obtained. In a second group, hybridization of adapted x adapted parents originated crosses with 100 % adapted genes. During the growing season 1994 / 95, the progenies F 4 : 3 [8] were evaluated by using the augmented block design. The progenies F 5 : 3 [8] were evaluated during the growing season 1995 / 96 in three experiments using augmented block design without repetition. The octuple crosses gave origin to superior progenies for all the characters studied. In the C 22 cross, OY values were 707 kg/ha. The estimates of heritability in relation to the crosses average resulted in the following mean, minimum and maximum values, respectively: number of days to maturity (52. 35 %, 3. 71 %, 84. 23 %); agronomic value (26. 69 %, 1. 62 %, 61. 28 %) and grain yield (29. 28 %, 1. 52 %, 61. 06 %). The observed <b>genetic</b> <b>gains</b> for grain yield in the early, intermediate and late F 5 : 3 [8] progenies were superior to the expected <b>genetic</b> <b>gains</b> and the observed <b>genetic</b> <b>gains</b> for OY were more expressive in the early and late F 5 :[8] progenies.

40|$|Genotype x {{environment}} interaction (G x E) {{is increasingly}} important, because breeding programs {{tend to be}} more internationally oriented. The aim of this theoretical study was to investigate the effects of G x E on <b>genetic</b> <b>gain</b> in sib-testing and progeny-testing schemes. Loss of <b>genetic</b> <b>gain</b> due to G x E was predicted for different values of heritability, number of progeny per dam, number of progeny per sire, proportion of selected sires, and population size in the selection environment. Two environments were considered: a selection environment (SLE) and a production environment (PDE). The breeding goal was only for performance in PDE. A pseudo-BLUP selection index was used to predict <b>genetic</b> <b>gain.</b> Recording of half-sibs or progeny in PDE limited the loss in <b>genetic</b> <b>gain</b> in PDE due to G x E between SLE and PDE. Progeny-testing schemes had less loss in <b>genetic</b> <b>gain</b> than sib-testing schemes. Higher heritability increased the loss in <b>genetic</b> <b>gain,</b> whereas increasing the number of progeny per sire in PDE decreased the loss in <b>genetic</b> <b>gain.</b> The number of progeny per sire required to minimize loss in <b>genetic</b> <b>gain</b> due to G x E was greater for sib-testing schemes than for progeny-testing schemes. More progeny per dam slightly increased the loss in <b>genetic</b> <b>gain.</b> Genetic gains for sex-limited and carcass traits were less affected by G x E than traits measured on both sexes. Loss in <b>genetic</b> <b>gain</b> was due to decreased accuracy of selection in most situations, but it was due to decreased selection intensity in situations with small population size and a low proportion of selected sires. It was concluded that recording performance of relatives in PDE minimizes loss in <b>genetic</b> <b>gain</b> due to G x E, and that progeny-testing schemes rather than sib-testing schemes are preferable in situations with low to moderate heritability (h(2) {{less than or equal to}} 0. 3), relatively short generation interval of progeny-tested sires (L-prog/L-sib less than or equal to 1. 7), and moderate to severe G x E interaction (r(g) less than or equal to 0. 8) ...|$|E
