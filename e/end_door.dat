2500|$|With the two Hi-Level prototypes {{in service}} and proving {{to not only}} {{meet the needs of}} line but also being popular with {{passengers}} who were afforded a much better view of the scenery from the upper level, the Santa Fe again approached Budd with the idea of building additional two-level cars, this time in five different configurations: Step-down coaches like the two prototype cars, convertible coaches which could have one end of the car converted from the high level on both ends to a step-down car as needed, coaches with both ends of the car having the <b>end</b> <b>door</b> at the upper level's height to provide access to adjoining passenger cars, dining cars and lounge cars (with kitchens on the lower level) which featured a partial glassed-in roof similar to the Big Dome lounge cars that were also built by Budd and delivered around the time the prototype Hi-Level cars were built. (The Hi-Level lounge cars are the only Hi-Level cars that remain in use by Amtrak.) ...|$|E

50|$|Covered Carriage Truck was {{a type of}} railway {{van with}} <b>end</b> <b>doors</b> used for moving motor cars or parcel traffic.

To take this child into the very shop frequented by his wife and friends seemed a little mad; but that same reason which caused them to frequent it--the {{fact that there was}} no other shop of the sort half so handy--was the reason which caused Hilary to go there now. He had acted on impulse; he knew that if he let his impulse cool he would not act at all. The bold course was the wise one; this was why he chose the <b>end</b> <b>door</b> round the corner. Standing aside for her to go in first, he noticed the girl's brightened eyes and cheeks; she had never looked so pretty. He glanced hastily round; the department was barren for their purposes, filled entirely with pyjamas. He felt a touch on his arm. The little model, rather pink, was looking up at him.|$|E

Now if I had charge of things here, I'd make such changes that you wouldn't know the place. I'd throw two rooms off here, and a corridor and entrance-door at that end of the building.

50|$|The Series 9 to Series 11 {{locomotives}} were visually {{indistinguishable from}} each other, {{but could be}} distinguished from all earlier models by the rainwater drainage holes on their lower sides.

Another distinction was the <b>end</b> <b>doors,</b> which were recessed into the doorframes on Series 9 to Series 11 locomotives, compared to earlier models which had their <b>end</b> <b>doors</b> flush with the doorframes. In addition, on Series 9 and later, the split side window on the driver's assistant side {{was replaced by a}} single rectangular side window with rounded corners. Finally, unlike all earlier models, all four doors on Series 9 to Series 11 locomotives had rounded corners.|$|R
5000|$|Built from March 1950.

Cab doors became round-cornered, and the kick plates were deleted. The wing windows became taller, with round corners. Two drip strips; one over cab windows, second over door.

50|$|In the 1970s most serving SAR {{steam and}} {{electric}} locomotives had their original large round headlamps replaced by less attractive but more efficient double sealed-beam automobile headlamps.

50|$|Variants of {{the covered}} goods wagon were also built with <b>end</b> <b>doors</b> from the 1920s to the 1960s.
