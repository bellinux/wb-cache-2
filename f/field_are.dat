5|$|The final {{images were}} {{released}} {{at a meeting}} of the American Astronomical Society in January 1996, and revealed a plethora of distant, faint galaxies. About 3,000 distinct galaxies could be identified in the images, with both irregular and spiral galaxies clearly visible, although some galaxies in the <b>field</b> <b>are</b> only a few pixels across. In all, the HDF is thought to contain fewer than twenty galactic foreground stars; by far the majority of objects in the <b>field</b> <b>are</b> distant galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Forensic {{chemistry}} positions {{require a}} bachelor's degree or similar {{in a natural}} or physical science as well as laboratory experience in general, organic, and analytical chemistry. Once in the position, individuals are trained in the protocols that are performed at that specific lab until they can prove they are competent to perform all experiments without supervision.. Practicing chemists already in the <b>field</b> <b>are</b> expected to have continuing education to maintain their proficiency.|$|E
50|$|Volatile <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> linearizable. Reading a {{volatile}} <b>field</b> <b>is</b> like acquiring a lock: the working memory is invalidated and the volatile <b>field's</b> current value <b>is</b> reread from memory. Writing {{a volatile}} <b>field</b> <b>is</b> like releasing a lock: the volatile <b>field</b> <b>is</b> immediately written back to memory.|$|R
50|$|Readsâ€”writes to <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> linearizable {{if either}} the <b>field</b> <b>is</b> volatile, or the <b>field</b> <b>is</b> {{protected}} by a unique lock which is acquired by all readers and writers.|$|R

5|$|Forensic firearm {{examination}} is {{the forensic}} process of examining {{the characteristics of}} firearms {{as well as any}} cartridges or bullets left behind at a crime scene. Specialists in this <b>field</b> <b>are</b> tasked with linking bullets and cartridges to weapons and weapons to individuals. Obliterated serial numbers can be raised and recorded in an attempt to find the registered owner of the weapon. Examiners can also look for fingerprints on the weapon and cartridges, and then viable prints can be processed through fingerprint databases for a potential match.|$|E
5|$|The bedrock {{under the}} {{watershed}} includes {{part of the}} last exotic terrane, a chain of seamounts, acquired by the North American Plate as it moved west during the Eocene. Known as the Waverly Hills Formation, it lies buried under ash and lava from later volcanic eruptions, sediments from flooding and erosion, and layers of wind-blown silt. Two dormant volcanoes from the Boring Lava <b>Field</b> <b>are</b> in the Tryon Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{was first}} {{isolated}} by Friedrich Miescher in 1869. Its molecular structure was first identified by James Watson and Francis Crick at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by Raymond Gosling, {{who was a}} post-graduate student of Rosalind Franklin. DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity. The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro- and nano-fabrication. Among notable advances in this <b>field</b> <b>are</b> DNA origami and DNA-based hybrid materials.|$|E

40|$|When an {{electric}} <b>field</b> <b>is</b> applied on a topological insulator, {{not only the}} electric <b>field</b> <b>is</b> generated, but also the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>is</b> generated, vice versa. I designed topological insulator and superconductor bi-layer magnetic cloak, derived the electric field and magnetic field {{inside and outside the}} topological insulator and superconductor sphere. Simulation and calculation results show that the applied magnetic <b>field</b> <b>is</b> screened by the topological insulator and superconductor bi-layer, and the electric <b>field</b> <b>is</b> generated in the cloaked region...|$|R
5|$|Like other {{volcanic}} {{zones in}} the Garibaldi Belt, volcanoes in the Mount Cayley <b>field</b> <b>are</b> not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active their magma systems are. This {{is partly because}} the field {{is located in a}} remote region and no major eruptions have occurred in Canada in the last few hundred years. As a result, volcano monitoring is less important than dealing with other natural processes, including tsunamis, earthquakes and landslides. However, with the existence of earthquakes, further volcanism is expected and would probably have considerable effects, particularly in a region like southwestern British Columbia where the Garibaldi Belt is located in a highly populated area. Because of these concerns, significant support from Canadian university scientists have resulted in the construction of a baseline of knowledge {{on the state of the}} Garibaldi volcanoes. This improvement is continuous and will support the understanding to monitor volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field for future volcanism.|$|E
5|$|Literary works {{connected}} to the game include the short fiction of Ring Lardner and novels such as Bernard Malamud's The Natural (the source for the movie), Robert Coover's The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop., and W. P. Kinsella's Shoeless Joe (the source for Field of Dreams). Baseball's literary canon also includes the beat reportage of Damon Runyon; the columns of Grantland Rice, Red Smith, Dick Young, and Peter Gammons; and the essays of Roger Angell. Among the celebrated nonfiction books in the <b>field</b> <b>are</b> Lawrence S. Ritter's The Glory of Their Times, Roger Kahn's The Boys of Summer, and Michael Lewis's Moneyball. The 1970 publication of major league pitcher Jim Bouton's tell-all chronicle Ball Four is considered {{a turning point in}} the reporting of professional sports.|$|E
5|$|Other {{characters}} in the Arthurian legends are described with coats of arms. Lancelot starts with plain white arms but later receives a shield with three bends gules signifying the strength of three men (Brault 47). Tristran was attributed a variety of arms. His earliest arms, a gold lion rampant on red <b>field,</b> <b>are</b> shown {{in a set of}} 13th-century tiles found in Chertsey Abbey (Loomis 1915, 308). Thomas of Britain in the 12th century attributed these arms (Loomis 1938, 47) in what is believed to be heraldic flattery of his patron, either Richard I or Henry II, whose coats of arms contained some form of lion (Loomis 1922, 26). In other versions the field is not red, but green. Gottfried von Strassburg attributed to Tristan a silver shield with a black boar rampant (Loomis 1922, 24; Loomis 1938, 49). In Italy, however, he was attributed geometric patterns (argent a bend gules per Loomis 1938, 59).|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{simplest}} physical <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> vector force <b>fields.</b> Historically, {{the first time that}} <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> taken seriously was with Faraday's lines of force when describing the electric field.

5|$|Stadium Station is {{situated}} {{at the intersection of}} the SODO Busway and Royal Brougham Way, under the ramps of Interstate 90, in the SODO neighborhood of Seattle. The station is adjacent to a King County Metro employee parking garage, which includes a pedestrian bridge over the platform to the Metro Ryerson Base, and the Seattle Greyhound bus station. The area surrounding Stadium Station contains a mixture of light industrial zoning, primarily home to the manufacturing and warehousing industry employing over 13,000 workers, with some retail uses. CenturyLink Field and Safeco <b>Field</b> <b>are</b> located one block west of the station on the north and south sides of Royal Brougham Way, respectively. The light rail line is paralleled to the east by a mixed-use bicycle trail called the SODO Trail, which connects Stadium Station to SODO station at South Lander Street. The Seattle Department of Transportation plans to extend the trail further south to Spokane Street, connecting it to a bike trail on the Spokane Street Viaduct, serving West Seattle.|$|E
5|$|Students must {{audition}} for admission; fewer than 20percent {{of those who}} apply each year are accepted. SCPA is free to CPS students but also attracts tuition-paying students from outside the district and the state. The newly combined school will serve approximately 1,300 students in 2010, offering a curriculum designed {{to prepare students for}} professional careers in creative writing, dance, drama, music, technical theater, and visual art. The emphasis is on performance, and students in every <b>field</b> <b>are</b> required to perform or present their work in public regularly. Students compete successfully in arts competitions locally and internationally. On standardized tests, SCPA ranks second among Cincinnati public schools. Ninety percent of graduating seniors continue on to college, and those students receive one of the highest levels of scholarship funding in the city. A limited number of extracurricular activities are offered, as students are expected to commit significant after-school time to training and performance. SCPA has produced notable graduates {{in a wide range of}} artistic fields, including award-winning actors, singers, directors and technicians.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} been home {{to a variety of}} notable people ranging from {{politicians}} to athletes and authors. Famous politicians to call Wilsonville home include former governor George Law Curry, Congresswoman Edith Green, federal judge James M. Burns, and former mayor and state representative Jerry Krummel. Athletes of note have included football player Derek Devine, professional golfer Brian Henninger, and baseball player and manager Del Baker. Those prominent in the legal <b>field</b> <b>are</b> Gordon Sloan, and R. William Riggs. Others include children's author Walt Morey, ferryman Alphonso Boone, businessman Tom Bruggere, and baseball coach Mel Krause, and actor Frank Cady.|$|E

5|$|The {{other two}} major {{international}} competition for track and <b>field</b> <b>are</b> organised by the IAAF. The IAAF had selected the Olympic competition as its world championship event in 1913, but a separate world championships for athletics alone was first held in 1983 â€“ the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The championships comprised {{track and field}} competitions plus the marathon and racewalking competitions. Initially, this worked on a quadrennial basis but, after 1991, it changed to a biennial format. In terms of indoor track and field, the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics has been held every two years since 1985 {{and this is the}} only world championships that consists of solely track and field events.|$|E
5|$|Vector spaces {{have many}} {{applications}} as they occur frequently in common circumstances, namely wherever functions with values in some <b>field</b> <b>are</b> involved. They {{provide a framework}} to deal with analytical and geometrical problems, or {{are used in the}} Fourier transform. This list is not exhaustive: many more applications exist, for example in optimization. The minimax theorem of game theory stating the existence of a unique payoff when all players play optimally can be formulated and proven using vector spaces methods. Representation theory fruitfully transfers the good understanding of linear algebra and vector spaces to other mathematical domains such as group theory.|$|E
5|$|While the {{electromagnetic}} field {{together with the}} gravitational <b>field</b> <b>are</b> the only classical fields providing accurate descriptions of nature, other types of classical fields are important too. In the approach to quantum field theory (QFT) referred to as second quantization, the starting point is one or more classical fields, where e.g. the wave functions solving the Dirac equation are considered as classical fields prior to (second) quantization. While second quantization and the Lagrangian formalism associated with {{it is not a}} fundamental aspect of QFT, it is the case that so far all quantum field theories can be approached this way, including the standard model. In these cases, there are classical versions of the field equations following from the Eulerâ€“Lagrange equations derived from the Lagrangian using the principle of least action. These field equations must be relativistically invariant, and their solutions (which will qualify as relativistic wave functions according to the definition below) must transform under some representation of the Lorentz group.|$|E
