2500|$|Small two-stroke, bolt-on {{gasoline}} bike {{motors and}} adapter kits for bicycles {{had a brief}} surge in popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the United States and Canada. These <b>engine</b> <b>kits</b> were designed or marketed by both small and large companies, including Bike Bug, Tas Spitz, and even Sears, which sold the Free Spirit, and Little Devil <b>engine</b> <b>kits.</b> Most of these kits were designed to use lightweight, low-cost two-stroke engines from Japanese manufacturers such as Tanaka. During the late 1990s, the arrival of inexpensive two-stroke engines and chain-drive transmissions from mainland China, designed to mount to bicycle frames, helped spark {{a new wave of}} United States consumer interest in motorized bicycles. Increasingly tighter United States emissions laws have made it more difficult for traditional two-stroke engines to pass emissions requirements, though Tanaka Inc. has since introduced a clean-burning [...] "Pure Fire" [...] line of two-stroke motors.|$|E

Ahmed claims {{that he has been}} able to achieve much higher amounts of HHO compared to any other inventor because of his [...] "undisclosed calculations". He has applied for a patent from the Government of Pakistan and is waiting for their feedback.|$|R

50|$|Mopeds {{occasionally}} resemble powered bicycles, {{more commonly}} called a motorized bicycle, though since ca. 2006 {{there has been}} a glut of <b>engine</b> <b>kits</b> shipped from China (although Tanaka had offered drive kits since the 1960s) designed in theory to transform a standard bicycle into a motor vehicle but lacking the benefit of proper brakes and lighting. In addition, the added stresses can cause the rear rim to warp, and the spokes to break, and if the engine is the least bit out of alignment the drive chain will come off the drive sprocket, causing the rim to warp and the spokes to break, as well as lodging the chain in the chainstay and causing injury to the operator.|$|E

The court affirmed his sentence of 54 months imprisonment, and required restitution of $224,148.10.|$|E
50|$|The earlier high {{piece and}} high detail kits were {{referred}} to as the Classic line. Later a less assembly intensive line appeared which was called the Prestige line of cars. Classic kits were known for their high piece count and incredible detail such as working brake systems, engines with rotating crankshafts and moving pistons, windows that moved up and down, steering that operated, and when a tiny key was inserted into the dashboard the headlights lit up. Classic kits faithfully represented mostly 1930s cars from Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Bugatti, Mercedes-Benz, and Rolls Royce. Prestige kits were most often die cast metal bodies and contained about 500 parts. They featured working suspension and opening doors and detailed engines. These kits were designed to provide attractive models that could be built with little difficulty. These were mostly of Ferraris such as the Testarossa and F40, along with a few Porsches. A third line existed which was called Pocher Truck. This consisted of two Volvo trucks using the same assembly method as Prestige - mainly press fit parts with superb detailing. Four separate <b>engine</b> <b>kits</b> were produced that featured the engines from Ferrari Testarossa, Ferrari F40, Volvo, and Bugatti. Of these four kits the Bugatti was the most complex as it had a moving crankshaft and pistons.|$|E
