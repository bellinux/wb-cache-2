5|$|Ystad in the {{southern}} Swedish region of Scania which was formerly part of Denmark still has some 300 half-timbered houses, several of them of historic importance. The oldest surviving <b>half-timbered</b> <b>house</b> in Denmark, built in 1527, is located in Køge {{on the east coast}} of Sealand.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century Johann Georg Kleine, Wilhelm Busch's {{maternal}} grandfather, {{settled in the}} small village of Wiedensahl. There, in 1817, he bought a thatched <b>half-timbered</b> <b>house,</b> where Wilhelm Busch was to be born about 15 years later. Amalie Kleine, Johann's wife and Wilhelm Busch's grandmother, kept a shop in which Busch's mother Henriette assisted while her two brothers attended high school. When Johann Georg Kleine died in 1820, his widow continued to run the shop with Henriette.|$|E
5|$|Before modern times, {{buildings}} were usually constructed of local materials, including wood, thatch etc. The Nook in Oulton (dated 1611) {{is a rare}} example of an original <b>half-timbered</b> <b>house.</b> Of the more durable materials, there are three rocks which have been substantially used. These are gritstone (a sort of sandstone) found {{to the north and}} west (e.g. Kirstall Abbey, Leeds Town Hall or Harewood House), different sandstones in the Yorkshire Coal Measures, and limestone to the north and east, as is shown in older villages (now suburbs) in these directions. To the south of the city are substantial clay deposits, so that red brick has been the predominant building material for the extensive nineteenth century housing. The particularly fine clay found in Burmantofts led to a decorative covering of terracotta or glazed Architectural Faience being used on both interior and exterior walls of important buildings.|$|E
50|$|Most {{constituent}} communities' cores {{are made}} up of <b>half-timbered</b> <b>houses.</b> Sometimes there are also little half-timbered churches preserved, such as the ones in Hommertshausen and Silberg. The Kratzputzfachwerkhäuser in Holzhausen am Hünstein, <b>half-timbered</b> <b>houses</b> with pargeting (etched plasterwork), are actually protected monuments.|$|R

5|$|Remembered {{above all}} for his fairy tales, Hans Christian Andersen {{was born in}} Odense in 1805. It is thought his birthplace is the small yellow house {{on the corner of}} Hans Jensens Stræde and Bangs Boder in the old town. In 1908 the house was opened as the Hans Christian Andersen Museum. It {{documents}} his life from his childhood years as the son of a struggling shoemaker, to his schooling, career as an author, and later life, with artefacts providing an insight into his acquaintances and adventures. Andersen's childhood home is on Munkemøllestræde not far from the cathedral. He lived in the little <b>half-timbered</b> <b>house</b> from the age of two until he was 14. Opened as a museum in 1930, the house contains an exhibition of the cobbling tools used by his father and other items based on Andersen's own descriptions.|$|E
25|$|Many town walls, monastic precincts and palaces had gatehouses {{built with}} a {{guardroom}} or living quarters above a large archway. One {{of the earliest}} is the gateway of Lorsch Abbey, {{the lower part of}} which has three openings like a Roman triumphal arch, while the upper part, of polychrome brick, has detailing resembling <b>half-timbered</b> <b>house,</b> the effect enhanced by the large steeply pitched slate roof. By contrast the gatehouse of the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds resembles a church tower. Many Romanesque gates are set into the walls of Italian cities. These are invariably of fine masonry and battlemented but otherwise without ornamentation.|$|E
25|$|Leopold de Rothschild, whose {{principal}} country residence was Gunnersbury Park, used Ascott {{at first}} as a hunting box, but realising the limitations imposed by its modest size, in 1874 he employed the architect George Devey to enlarge it. The present <b>half-timbered</b> <b>house</b> is largely {{the result of that}} commission. Devey attempted to design a house that rambled as though it had grown and developed over centuries. The project became a lifetime work for Devey as the house was continually expanded during the remainder of the 19th century. The rambling and climbing shrubs he had planted as part of the design of the facades that Mary Gladstone described in her memoirs are no longer there.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} well-preserved <b>half-timbered</b> <b>houses</b> {{in the center}} of the town, e.g. in Breite Strasse street, a {{comparatively}} broad street which might have been an oblong market as the town has never had a rectangular market place like other market towns. Lange Straße is another historic street with traditional <b>half-timbered</b> <b>houses.</b> Some houses have doors with colourful wood carvings.|$|R
25|$|Other {{evidence}} of the Walloons and Huguenots in Canterbury includes a block of houses in Turnagain Lane, where weavers' windows survive on the top floor, as many Huguenots worked as weavers. The Weavers, a <b>half-timbered</b> <b>house</b> by the river, {{was the site of}} a weaving school from the late 16th century to about 1830. (It has been adapted as a restaurant—see illustration above. The house derives its name from a weaving school which was moved there {{in the last years of}} the 19th century, reviving an earlier use.) Other refugees practised the variety of occupations necessary to sustain the community as distinct from the indigenous population. Such economic separation was the condition of the refugees' initial acceptance in the City. They also settled elsewhere in Kent, particularly Sandwich, Faversham and Maidstone—towns in which there used to be refugee churches.|$|E

Restaurants include the Cuckoos Nest bar and restaurant, the Brasserie Klitgaard, the Den Gamle Kro, set in a 17th-century <b>half-timbered</b> <b>house,</b> Kvægtorvet, run by leading chef Klavs Styrbæk who serves fresh fish and meat dishes, which is now closed, and the Under Lindetraet in an 18th-century cottage opposite the Hans Christian Andersen house which serves Franco-Danish cuisine. [...] Hotels of note include the Radisson SAS HC Andersen Hotel, the First Hotel Grand with its brasserie bar, the 68-room Old English-style Clarion Collection Hotel Plaza, City Hotel, which is {{in close proximity to}} the Hans Christian Andersen museum, and the 140-room Danhostel Odense City.|$|E

Yet the thing was so, and when even his great-great-grandson was dead and decayed and forgotten, when the sham <b>half-timbered</b> <b>house</b> had {{gone the way of}} all shams, and the Times was extinct, and the silk hat a ridiculous antiquity, and the modestly imposing stone that had been sacred to Mr. Morris had been burnt to make lime for mortar, and all that Mr. Morris had found real and important was sere and dead, the world was still going on, and people were still going about it, just as heedless and impatient of the Future, or, indeed, of anything but their own selves and property, as Mr. Morris had been.|$|E

60|$|The Italian Bagnolo who {{combined}} with his salient artistic talents a quarrelsome, volcanic humour had the mischance {{to kill a}} man in a brawl in a Southwark tavern. As a result he fled the town, nor paused in his headlong flight from the consequences of that murderous deed until he had all but reached the very ends of England. Under what circumstances he became acquainted with Tressilian the elder I do not know. But certain it is that the meeting was a very timely one for both of them. To the fugitive, Ralph Tressilian--who appears to have been inveterately partial to the company of rascals of all denominations--afforded shelter; and Bagnolo repaid the service by offering to rebuild the decaying <b>half-timbered</b> <b>house</b> of Penarrow. Having taken the task in hand he went about it with all the enthusiasm of your true artist, and achieved for his protector a residence that was a marvel of grace in that crude age and outlandish district. There arose {{under the supervision of the}} gifted engineer, worthy associate of Messer Torrigiani, a noble two-storied mansion of mellow red brick, flooded with light and sunshine by the enormously tall mullioned windows that rose almost from base to summit of each pilastered facade. The main doorway was set in a projecting wing and was overhung by a massive balcony, the whole surmounted by a pillared pediment of extraordinary grace, now partly clad in a green mantle of creepers. Above the burnt red tiles of the roof soared massive twisted chimneys in lofty majesty.|$|E
60|$|From {{one corner}} of Ribbleton Moor, the scene of Cromwell's victory over Langdale, there is as lovely a view as ever painter dreamed of. Far below the spectator the Ribble sweeps almost in a circle beneath the scars which, {{by the action of}} years of this washing, have been scooped out so as to form a large precipice, under which the waters flow, marking out in their course the great 'horse-shoe meadow,' with its fringe of shining sand. The {{peaceful}} valley through which the river, reflecting in its moving bosom the overhanging many-tinted woods and cliffs, meanders {{on its way to the}} sea, is bounded afar-off by noble hills, the whale-like Pendle towering in majestic grandeur above the rest. From the moor a rough and stony lane winds down the wooded hillside, past a beautiful old <b>half-timbered</b> <b>house</b> down to the dusty highway and the bridge over the Belisamia of the Romans. The beautiful river, with its tremulous earth and sky pictures, the meadows and corn-fields whence come now and again the laugh and song of the red-faced mowers and reapers, the clearly-defined roads and white farm-houses, the spires of distant hillside churches, and the rich green of the waving woods, make up an enchanting picture. When night comes, however, and the lovely stars peep out, and the crescent moon casts her glamour over the dreaming earth, and half-hidden in a dimly transparent veil of shimmering mist the Ribble glides as gently as though it had paused to listen to its own melody, a still deeper loveliness falls upon the dreaming landscape, over which the very genius of beauty seems to hover silently with outspread wings.|$|E
