40|$|ABSTRACT: Using a {{scanning}} tunneling and {{atomic force microscope}} {{combined with}} in-vacuum atomic hydrogen cleaning we demonstrate stable scanning tunneling spectros-copy (STS) with nanoscale resolution on electrically active nanowire devices in the common lateral configuration. We use this method to map out the surface density of states on both the GaSb and InAs segments of GaSb−InAs Esaki diodes {{as well as the}} transition region between the two segments. Generally the surface shows small bandgaps centered around the Fermi level, which is attributed to a thin multielement surface layer, except in the diode transition region where we observe a sudden broadening of the bandgap. By applying a bias to the nanowire we find that the STS spectra shift according to the local nanoscale potential <b>drop</b> <b>inside</b> the <b>wire.</b> Importantly, this shows that we have a nanoscale probe with which we can infer both surface electronic structure and the local potential inside the nanowire and we can connect this information directly to the performance of the imaged device...|$|R

40|$|The hydrodynamics and heat/mass {{transport}} {{associated with}} condensation on a moving drop {{have been investigated}} for the intermediate Reynolds-number range of drop motion (Re = O(100)). The drop environment {{is a mixture of}} saturated vapour and a non-condensable. The formulation entails a simultaneous solution of the quasi-steady elliptic partial differential equations that describe the flow field and transport in the gaseous phase, and the motion <b>inside</b> the liquid <b>drop.</b> The heat transport <b>inside</b> the <b>drop</b> is treated as a transient process. Results are reported for the interfacial velocities, drag, external and internal flow structure, heat flux, drop growth rate and temperature-time history <b>inside</b> the <b>drop.</b> The results obtained here have been compared with experimental data where available, and these show excellent agreement. The results reveal several novel features. The surface-shear stress increases with condensation. The pressure level {{in the rear of the}} drop is higher. As a consequence, the friction drag is higher and the pressure drag is lower. The total drag coefficient increases with condensation rate for small values of drop size or temperature differential, and it decreases for large values of these parameters. The volume of the separated-flow region in the rear of the drop decreases with condensation. At very high rates of condensation, the recirculatory wake is completely suppressed. Condensation also delays the appearance of the weak secondary internal vortex motion in the drop. The heat and mass fluxes are significantly affected by the presence of the non-condensable in the gaseous phase and by the circulation <b>inside</b> the <b>drop...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} considers adding customer end-point separation in {{spectrum management}} calculations in Annex A {{of the draft}} Spectrum Management Standard. It is shown that a model with customer endpoint separation on a distribution cable decreases the performance of guarded services. A model with customer end-point separation on drop and inside-wire increases the performance of guarded services, but only very slightly because the separation is only about 100 ft. A model with customer end-point separation on both the distribution cable and the <b>drop</b> <b>wire</b> is briefly examined and its impact is mixed, sometimes the performance of guarded services increases slightly, and sometimes it decreases slightly. The overall change is negligible.

40|$|International audienceAn {{original}} process of actinides coprecipitation based on pulsed flow column is studied. The novelty {{of this process}} lies in the confinement of the aqueous reagents in separated droplets, dispersed in an inert organic phase (W/O emulsion). Precipitation occurs <b>inside</b> <b>drops</b> when they coalesce. Besides the implementation of well-known technologies of the nuclear industry, this precipitation in emulsion process is particularly convenient for the control of supersaturation, and ensures the sticky precipitates' confinement within drops, thereby limiting the fouling risk and its adverse consequences on productivity and safety. A thorough understanding of the precipitation mechanisms and their interactions with the hydrodynamic conditions prevailing around and <b>inside</b> the <b>drops</b> {{is essential for the}} process optimization. In this context, numerical simulations were conducted, accompanying experiments, to study the process sensitivity. Different levels were considered in the modeling task, going from the emulsion behavior inside the column, to the reagents mixing and precipitation within the drops. Regarding the drop scale, on which we focus in this paper, preliminary static and dynamic observations revealed a stage of mixing of the reagents, followed by a progressive concentration of particles at the drop center leading to their agglomeration. In the modeling three configurations of the reagents' mixing were therefore considered relatively to the Hill vortices experimentally noticed. CFD simulations allowed calculating possible mean supersaturation profiles in the drop. Two simplified models were proposed to simulate the precipitation <b>inside</b> the <b>drops.</b> Based on the population balance modeling framework, they consider primary nucleation and growth mechanisms and take into consideration either instantaneous or progressive mixing of the reagents. These simplified models were validated with CFD + PBM simulations. Based on the drop scale simulations, process modeling has been discussed...|$|R

For the non-deforming droplet, the resultant MHD flow <b>inside</b> the <b>drop</b> can be inferred from motion of impurity particulates on the surface. In the experiments, subsequent to melting, Joule heating produces a continuous reduction of viscosity of the fluid resulting in an acceleration of the flow with time. These observations indicate formation {{of a pair of}} co-rotating toroidal flow structures <b>inside</b> the spheroidal <b>drop</b> that undergo flow instabilities. As the fluid temperature rises, the amplitude of the secondary flow increases; and beyond a point, the tracers exhibit non-coherent chaotic motion signifying emergence of turbulence <b>inside</b> the <b>drop.</b> Assuming that the observed laminar-turbulent transition is shear-layer type, the internal structure of the toroidal loops is used to develop a semi- empirical correlation for the onset of turbulence.
