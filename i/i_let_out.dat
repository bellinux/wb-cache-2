6000|$|For me {{the keepers}} of convicts {{shoulder}} their carbines and keep watch, [...] It is <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> {{in the morning}} and barr'd at night.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't," [...] says I. [...] "Excitement's just eating me up." [...] And then <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> a {{yell and}} turned loose my forty-five through the skylight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Growed!" [...] said Gabriel, scornfully. [...] "And haven't <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> the tucks, and didn't I put {{three fingers}} of the best sacking around the waist? You'll just ruin me in clothes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For don't I know," [...] {{said his}} mother, [...] "that if once <b>I</b> <b>let</b> you <b>out,</b> <b>I</b> should find you croaking at a choir {{practice}} at Woodside?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You shall {{stay here}} for the present," [...] snapped Josiah Crabtree. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>let</b> you <b>out</b> <b>I</b> think you'll be a sadder and perhaps a wiser boy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I dare say, but that's my secret. My mamma {{and yours}} {{would be ready}} to kill me with rage if they knew <b>I</b> had <b>let</b> <b>out</b> even so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh bad--very bad! Poor chap, he got excited, and do blaspeam terribly, since <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> some gossip by accident--the more to my blame. But there--you must excuse {{a man in}} {{suffering}} for what he says, and I hope God will forgive him." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> {{the best}} of it first--that is to say, I told him what I have related in the {{preceding}} pages. Fritz was deeply interested: full of compassion for Jack Straw, but not in the least converted to my aunt's confidence in him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do in {{the winter}} time, {{but not in the}} summer. I've got a tidy farm down the river a bit, and <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> my hosses to the company to haul timber. It's cash money, you see, when the haulin' is goin' on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{it is the}} time," [...] {{answered}} the other; [...] "at least if <b>I</b> don't <b>let</b> <b>out</b> my mind now, it's not likely I'll find a fitter {{time to do it}} in this world." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> nearly <b>let</b> <b>out</b> a damn at this. But {{just then}} the {{respected}} Miss Blank put her head in, {{and said that the}} cab was at the door, if Mr. Stonor wanted to catch the eleven three up.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will {{be better}} off with me; anyway, you must come on. If <b>I</b> <b>let</b> you <b>out</b> of my sight, and you fall in with those Americans, you will betray me to them. Come, we must lose no time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's jist that, Pop; and I ez good ez let 'em know I seed it. I ain't a fool, if {{some folks}} do drop {{their eyes and}} pertend to wipe the laugh out of their noses with a {{handkerchief}} when <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> to speak. I mayn't be good enough kempany--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Having {{got as far}} as that, I {{stopped to}} {{consider}} how I should put the questions to him that I was burning to ask. But I was too confused, I suppose, or perhaps too impatient to consider. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> what was uppermost in my mind, in the words that came first.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I wasn't going to. Half the {{pleasure}} of a feeling lies {{in being able to}} express it {{on the spur of the}} moment, and <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> mine. It would have been just the same if you had been the reverse person--ugly and old--I should have exclaimed about it in the same way." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>let</b> them <b>out</b> {{myself and}} held the lamp over my head to light them on their way. With slow {{uncertain}} steps, and leaning heavily upon Lady Angela's arm, I watched him disappear in the blackness of the plantation.|$|R
6000|$|... "'The gentleman went upstairs, sir, {{and about}} {{a quarter of an hour}} later he come down again, and <b>I</b> <b>let</b> him <b>out.</b> He was in a great hurry then, he threw me a half-crown and said: [...] "Good night."' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} it is," [...] Dauncey confessed. [...] "The {{agreement}} seems all right, but I saw their faces when <b>I</b> <b>let</b> 'em <b>out.</b> <b>I</b> can't see the flaw, Jacob, but it's not an honest deal. They've got something up their sleeve." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was up on}} {{the deck}} when a yell from below made me jump. I ran back. Some one was holding my rod, and on the instant that a huge {{swordfish}} got the bait had not {{the presence of mind}} to throw off the drag and let out line. We hurried to put on another flying-fish and <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> the line.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd an {{exciting}} dream last night for once," [...] said Dan triumphantly. [...] "I dreamt old Peg Bowen chased me. I thought I {{was up to}} her house and she took after me. You bet I scooted. And she caught me--yes, sir! I felt her skinny hand reach out and clutch my shoulder. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> a screech--and woke up." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then it {{was that}} <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> a few links. I called him {{a son of a}} toad. I called him all the other things he had called me. And then I called him a few {{additional}} things. I came from the West, where men knew how to swear, and I wasn't going to let any mangy shack on a measly New England [...] "jerk" [...] put it over me in vividness and vigor of language. At first the shack tried to laugh it down. Then he made the mistake of attempting to reply. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> a few more links, and I cut him to the raw and therein rubbed winged and flaming epithets. Nor was my fine frenzy all whim and literary; I was indignant at this vile creature, who, in default of a dollar, would consign me to three months of slavery. Furthermore, I had a sneaking idea that he got a [...] "drag" [...] out of the constable fees.|$|E
60|$|We got rather {{near him}} this time, as he turned, facing us, and slowly swam in the {{direction}} of my bait. I could see the barracuda shining astern. Dan stopped the boat. <b>I</b> slowly <b>let</b> <b>out</b> line. The swordfish drifted back, and then sank.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>I</b> <b>let</b> myself <b>out,</b> {{it would}} look like unbecoming {{pressing}} of myself, considering what I am; but if you think I ought, I will say more. I have become so much used to writing letters under constraint, that I know I am very dry.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can do like me, order some fresh," [...] she said. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>let</b> you <b>out</b> of {{my sight}} I know very well how much I shall see of you {{for the rest of}} the day. Explain now if you can. What does that {{telegram}} mean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{then the}} beans were spilled [...] . by accident. Come {{a letter from}} Wisconsin. My Aunt Eliza 'd died and up and left me her big farm. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> a whoop when I read it; but I could have canned my joy, for I was jobbed out of it by the courts and lawyers afterward--not a cent to me, and I'm still paying 'm in instalments.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cut the ropes!" [...] vociferated Byfield; {{and to my}} {{infinite}} relief I {{saw that}} Dalmahoy was doing his best. A hand clutched at my heel. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> viciously, amid a roar of the crowd; felt the kick reach and rattle home on somebody's teeth; and, as the crowd made a rush and the balloon swayed and shot upwards, heaved myself over the rim into the car.|$|E
60|$|My heart failed me when I saw him {{squaring}} at me {{with every}} demonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy {{as if he were}} minutely choosing his bone. I never have been so surprised in my life, as I was when <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> the first blow, and saw him lying on his back, looking up {{at me with}} a bloody nose and his face exceedingly fore-shortened.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you worry}} about that, Dave. <b>I</b> won't <b>let</b> them <b>out</b> of my sight until they are safe and sound," [...] {{declared}} the real estate dealer's son.|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] said Jonas, [...] "you {{see that}} when the air is kept in, you cannot bring the sides {{together}}; but when <b>I</b> <b>let</b> the air <b>out,</b> then they come together easily." ...|$|R
60|$|Dan sighted a big swordfish. We {{made for}} him. Dan {{put on an}} albacore. But it came off before <b>I</b> could <b>let</b> <b>out</b> the line. Then we tried a {{barracuda}}. I got a long line out and the hook pulled loose. This was unfortunate and aggravating. We had one barracuda left. Dan hooked it on hard.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'd reduce my screw, would ye?" [...] roared Captain Hamilton Miggs, working {{himself into}} a fury. [...] "Me that has worked for ye, and slaved for ye, and risked my life for ye. You try it on, guv'nor; just you try it on! Suppose <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> that little story o' the {{painting}} out o' the marks--where would the firm of Girdlestone be then! I guess you'd rather double my wage than have that yarn goin' about." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed like}} a dream. Too good to be true! <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> a shout when I hooked him and a yell of joy when he broke water--a big swordfish, over two hundred pounds. What really transpired on Captain Dan's boat the {{following}} few moments I cannot adequately describe. Suffice {{to say that it}} was violent effort, excitement, and hilarity. I never counted the leaps of the swordfish. I never clearly saw him after that first leap. He seemed only a gleam in flying spray. Still, I did not make any mistakes.|$|E
60|$|I {{will not}} weary you with too {{detailed}} {{an account of}} the talk of a foolish youth who was also distressed and unhappy, and whose voice was balm for the humiliations that smarted in his eyes. Indeed, now in many particulars I cannot disentangle this harangue of which I tell from many of the things I may have said in other talks to Parload. For example, I forget if it was then or before or afterwards that, as it were by accident, <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> what might be taken as an admission that I was addicted to drugs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Burns, it's {{up to you}} and me," [...] he said, in a low tone. [...] "I've got to fan {{the rest}} of these hitters. You're doing splendidly. Now, watch close for my drop. Be ready to go down on your knees. When <b>I</b> <b>let</b> myself <b>out,</b> the ball {{generally}} hits the ground just back of the plate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is your doing, madam," [...] exclaimed Betty, passionately, {{completely}} overset by the insinuation; [...] "you bid us trust you, {{and then}} confess {{that you have}} exposed my sweet sister to be vilely slandered! Oh my Aurelia, why did <b>I</b> <b>let</b> you <b>out</b> of my sight?" [...] she cried, while hot tears stood in her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can give}} you fifteen minutes more, my lady," [...] said Clarence, [...] "provided <b>I</b> may <b>let</b> her <b>out</b> and take my corners just exactly in my own way." ...|$|R
