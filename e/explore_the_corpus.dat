40|$|What does ‘theatre of mercy’ mean? Is it a {{dramatic}} form of Christian tradition? Is it {{a particular kind}} of literary or poetic text?

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} extending and tuning a terminological semantic lexicon to new domains and corpora.

Although word semantic categorization cannot be fully automated, the results show that our tagging procedure is a valuable help to account for new words and new word usages in a sublanguage. 1...|$|R
40|$|Contextualized within immigrants’ {{acquisition}} of specialized {{knowledge about the}} host country at the institutional level, this article examines a 64295 -word corpus of textbooks written for participants of the orientation course in German politics, history and culture. Corpus-based techniques (“keyness,” collocation and qualitative examination of concordance lines) are deployed to <b>explore</b> <b>the</b> <b>corpus.</b> The findings reveal that the collocational patterns of the identified keywords construct particular world views vis-à-vis Germany. For instance, the keyword DDR [German Democratic Republic (GDR), aka East Germany] frequently co-occurs with negatively connoted lexis while collocates of the keywords denoting present-day Germany (e. g., Bundesrepublik Deutschland [Federal Republic of Germany] and Staat [nation, country, state]) facilitate the portrayal of Germany as a nurturing welfare state that is popular among foreigners. It is argued that such discursively-construed opposition between the “bad” GDR and the “good” Federal Republic of Germany helps to legitimize the German reunification. Furthermore, {{it is found that}} certain keywords (e. g., Sie [you], Kurs [course, class] and z. B. [e. g. ]) are “metadiscourse resources” (Hyland, 2005).

Corpus-based teaching involves the use of: •large, electronically stored collections of authentic language •an interface of computerised tools for identifying and describing its features •activities designed to direct learners’ attention to those features. A sub-corpus will be constructed, from the British National Corpus, of texts written for children. A new interface appropriate for primary school pupils will then be developed. The research will investigate how children at Key Stage 2 (the upper primary age-range) respond to language presented in this format. Teaching materials and activities which draw learners’ attention to features of grammar and vocabulary will be devised from the corpus, and the children will be observed as they complete the tasks set and devise investigations for themselves.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND:Patient {{healthcare}} trajectory is {{a recent}} emergent topic in the literature, encompassing broad concepts. However, the rationale for studying patients' trajectories, and how this trajectory concept is defined remains a public health challenge. Our research was focused on patients' trajectories based on disease management and care, while also considering medico-economic aspects of the associated management. We illustrated this concept with an example: a myocardial infarction (MI) occurring in a patient's hospital trajectory of care. The patient follow-up was traced via the prospective payment system. We applied a semi-automatic text mining process to conduct {{a comprehensive review of}} patient healthcare trajectory studies. This review investigated how the concept of trajectory is defined, studied and what it achieves. METHODS:We performed a PubMed search to identify reports that had been published in peer-reviewed journals between January 1, 2000 and October 31, 2015. Fourteen search questions were formulated to guide our review. A semi-automatic text mining process based on a semantic approach was performed to conduct a comprehensive review of patient healthcare trajectory studies. Text mining techniques were used to <b>explore</b> <b>the</b> <b>corpus</b> in a semantic perspective in order to answer non-a priori questions. Complementary review methods on a selected subset were used to answer a priori questions. RESULTS:Among the 33, 514 publications initially selected for analysis, only 70 relevant articles were semi-automatically extracted and thoroughly analysed. Oncology is particularly prevalent due to its already well-established processes of care. For the trajectory thema, 80 % of articles were distributed in 11 clusters. These clusters contain distinct semantic information, for example health outcomes (29 %), care process (26 %) and administrative and financial aspects (16 %). CONCLUSION:This literature review highlights the recent interest in the trajectory concept. The approach is also gradually being used to monitor trajectories of care for chronic diseases such as diabetes, organ failure or coronary artery and MI trajectory of care, to improve care and reduce costs. Patient trajectory is undoubtedly an essential approach to be further explored in order to improve healthcare monitoring...|$|E

It consists of a theoretical part, presenting and <b>exploring</b> <b>the</b> field of phraseology advocated by authors like Sinclair (1991), Hunston and Francis (2000), and Stubbs (2001), and discussing central terms and definitions. In the empirical part, this project thoroughly maps out the patterns of fun and funny using two large-scale, balanced <b>corpora,</b> <b>The</b> <b>Corpus</b> of Contemporary American English (COCA) and <b>The</b> British National <b>Corpus</b> (BNC). Both qualitative and quantitative research methods are used in <b>exploring</b> <b>the</b> <b>corpora.</b> <b>The</b> findings are also compared to a dictionary and a grammar. One of the main findings is that fun is a central adjective in COCA and a peripheral one in the BNC.

The difference between the use of fun and funny often resides in the patterns they prefer, and they are found to evaluate different types of words...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyses}} a corpus of audio recordings of authentic business meetings. The recordings {{were made in}} a variety of companies in the UK, and also in Eire, Germany and Japan. The companies which provided the data vary considerably in terms of area of business and size. The meetings themselves differ in terms of number of speakers, the relationships of the speakers, and the purposes and topics discussed; throughout the thesis the influence of these factors on communication is discussed. Previous studies of the language used in business meetings have focussed on either specific aspects of one type of meeting, such as strategies in sales negotiations, or have attempted to describe the attributes of `the business meeting' based on arguably unrepresentative data. For example, frameworks purporting to describe the genre of the meeting have been based solely on internal, or intra-organisational, data. This study is unique in that it analyses and compares a wide range of both internal and external meetings. The main purpose of the thesis is to <b>explore</b> <b>the</b> <b>corpus</b> in order to construct a generic model which accounts for the recurrence and dynamism within the data. This involves quantitative and qualitative analysis at the level of lexicogrammatical choice, including pronouns, deontic-modal expressions, certain key words such as problem, issue and if, metaphors and idioms, and vague language. Various `higher level' factors are also explored, such as speaker goals, strategies, conflict, convergence, `face', turn-taking, and overall structure. Through applying different approaches, such as corpus linguistics, discourse analysis, conversation analysis, and genre analysis, to the same data, a more fine-grained understanding of the data is achieved, and the assumption that business meetings are demonstrably different from and yet related to everyday spoken English is explored. The results indicate that business meetings can be categorised as a distinct genre with recurrent aspects which speakers and listeners orient towards, recognisable to both participants and observers. The study also highlights consistent differences between internal and external meetings. There is also evidence for a probabilistic relationship between the genre and the language used therein.

40|$|The present paper {{stems from}} a {{contrastive}} corpus-based study of phraseology in Spanish, Italian and English criminal judgments (Pontrandolfo 2013). By <b>exploring</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corpus</b> of Criminal Judgments (COSPE), a large comparable trilingual corpus (Spanish, Italian, English) of approximately 6 million words, the present paper aims at investigating the close relationship among specialised discourse, discourse markers and translation. The focus {{of the study is}} on special particles which play a pivotal role in judicial texts: “contrargumentative markers” (Portolés 1998, Montolío 2001) or “antioriented argumentative markers” (Escandell 2013), which, following Rudolph (1996) have been labeled “argumentative markers of contrast”. The primary objective of the paper is to carry out a quantitative analysis of the distribution of this type of discourse markers in COSPE, as well as a qualitative analysis aimed at characterising the markers uses in COSPE and identifying trends of use in judicial discourse. The secondary objective, which nevertheless guides the whole study, is to carry out a legal translation-oriented analysis. Indeed, studying discourse markers is a necessary precondition for translators, since the semantic and pragmatic relations conveyed by these particles and their distributional differences represent the guidelines for the selection of adequate translation solutions (cf. Visconti 2000, Garofalo 2006). From a methodological point of view, the study combines a qualitative approach oriented at the discourse genre (cf. Bhatia 1993, Garofalo 2009) with a more qualiquantitative approach based on corpus linguistics, more specifi cally on corpus-assisted discourse studies (Partington 2004, Partington et al. 2013) ...|$|R
