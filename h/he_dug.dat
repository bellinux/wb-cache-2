5|$|The son of Leslie Keith Davidson and Hilda Aileen Clifton, Davidson {{grew up in}} Lisarow, New South Wales (NSW) {{near the}} city of Gosford on the NSW Central Coast. He learnt to play cricket on a pitch that <b>he</b> <b>dug</b> out of a hill on his family's rural property. By the age of nine, he was playing in the second {{division}} of the Gosford grade competition. Throughout his high school years, he represented Northern High Schools in the state combined public schools' competition where he played against his future Test captain Richie Benaud, who captained City High Schools. During his teenage years, Davidson kept fit by working on the family property, chopping wood and carrying farm produce.|$|E
5|$|The Earl of Essex's {{campaign}} failed, {{suffering a}} total defeat at the Battle of Lostwithiel in early September 1644. His remaining forces retreated back to Dorset, leaving only Plymouth, Lyme Regis and Taunton under Parliamentarian {{control in the}} South West. Blake {{was aware of the}} vulnerability of Taunton, which, unlike many towns and cities of the time, did not have any town walls. On {{the eastern side of the}} town, which was the most vulnerable, <b>he</b> <b>dug</b> trenches outside the Eastern gate and erected a barricade across the street within it. At least three earthen forts were also built in that end of town. King Charles I held council in Chard, and shortly after ordered a Royalist force numbering 3,000 troops to set up the first siege of Taunton. Initially, Sir Francis Dodington was going to command the attack, but the only available men were those in Bridgwater under the command of Colonel Edmund Wyndham.|$|E
5|$|During {{the worst}} European winter in 40 years, the 48th Battalion {{continued}} {{to take its}} turn at the front line, and Leane was mentioned in despatches for the fourth time. In March 1917 his battalion followed up the Germans as they withdrew towards the multi-layered Hindenburg Line of fortifications. In early April 1917, the 12th Brigade was committed to an attack aimed at capturing Bullecourt, with the 48th Battalion given the task of capturing the secondary objective, following behind the 46th Battalion. During the preparations, due to a misunderstanding, Leane was ordered by his brigade commander to send 200 troops into the village of Bullecourt, which Leane believed to be well defended. Characteristically, Leane insisted that if the order must be carried out, it would involve the destruction {{of one of his}} companies, and he would have to choose that commanded by his nephew Allan. The timely arrival of a divisional staff officer clarified the situation, and the order was cancelled. On the morning of 10 April, the battalion was formed up for the attack when the promised tank support failed to arrive on time, and the assault was postponed. During the withdrawal back to the front line, Leane's brother, Major Benjamin Leanenow the second-in-command of the unitwas killed by shell fire, and the battalion suffered another 20 casualties. Leane found Ben's body among the dead, and carried him to a spot where <b>he</b> <b>dug</b> a grave before erecting a cross above it.|$|E

25|$|He {{conducted}} excavations in the Linea Vieja lowlands of Costa Rica in the 1960s. Concentrating on tombs, <b>he</b> <b>dug</b> at five sites between Siquirres and Guapiles, {{and published}} {{a series of}} C- 14 dates ranging from 1440 to 1470 CE, and arranged much of the pottery excavated in an approximate chronological sequence.|$|E
25|$|Vercingetorix {{sent the}} cavalry around Gaul {{to call the}} Gallic tribes to war and come to Alesia. When Caesar heard of this from deserters and captives, <b>he</b> <b>dug</b> a trench twenty feet deep (6 metres, 19ft.) with {{perpendicular}} sides, built all other works four hundred feet (118 m, 388ft.) away from that trench and in between <b>he</b> <b>dug</b> two trenches fifteen feet (4.4 m,14.5ft.) in length and depth. The inner one was filled with water from the rivers. Behind them he built a twelve feet high (3.5 m, 11.6ft.) rampart and wall with a parapet and large stakes projecting from the joint between the parapet and the battlement to prevent the enemy from scaling it. This was surrounded with turrets eighty feet apart (23.7 m, 77.7ft.). The stakes for the palisade were sharpened to a point, sunk into a five-feet deep trench (1.5m, 4.85ft.), fastened at the bottom {{so that they could}} not be pulled up, and placed in five intersected rows. Eight rows, three feet apart (0.89 m, 2.9ft.), of conic pits which were three feet deep were dug in oblique rows {{in the form of a}} quincunx (an arrangement of five objects with four at the corners the fifth at the centre) in front of the palisade.They were called 'cippi.' Stakes sharpened at the top and hardened with fire, the thickness of a man’s thigh, were sunk in the pits and protruded four inches (0.1 m, 3.9 inches) from the ground. The pits were filled with clay and covered over with twigs. One-foot-long stakes (0.3 m) with iron hooks were sunk at small intervals in front of the pits. To prepare for the arrival of the Gallic relief forces he constructed an outer fortification, a contravallation, with the same specifications as protection against external attack by the Gallic relief force. The besiegers were preparing to be besieged.|$|E

25|$|When Rome {{suffered}} severe defeats in 396 BC, {{the tenth}} year of this war, the Romans resorted again to Camillus, {{who was named}} dictator for the first time. After defeating both Falerii and Capena at Nepete, Camillus commanded the final strike against Veii. <b>He</b> <b>dug</b> the soft ground below {{the walls and the}} Romans infiltrated through the city's sewage system effectively, defeating the enemy. Not interested in capitulation terms, but in Veii's complete destruction, the Romans slaughtered the entire adult male population and made slaves of all the women and children. The plunder was large. For the battle, Camillus had invoked the protection of Mater Matuta extensively, and he looted the statue of Juno for Rome. Back in Rome, Camillus paraded on a quadriga, a four-horse chariot, and the popular celebrations lasted four days.|$|E
25|$|When World War II {{broke out}} in September 1939, Cartier-Bresson joined the French Army as a Corporal in the Film and Photo unit. During the Battle of France, in June 1940 at St. Dié in the Vosges Mountains, he was {{captured}} by German soldiers and spent 35 months in prisoner-of-war camps doing forced labor under the Nazis. He twice {{tried and failed to}} escape from the prison camp, and was punished by solitary confinement. His third escape was successful and he hid on a farm in Touraine before getting false papers that allowed him to travel in France. In France, he worked for the underground, aiding other escapees and working secretly with other photographers to cover the Occupation and then the Liberation of France. In 1943, <b>he</b> <b>dug</b> up his beloved Leica camera, which he had buried in farmland near Vosges. At {{the end of the war}} he was asked by the American Office of War Information to make a documentary, Le Retour (The Return) about returning French prisoners and displaced persons.|$|E
25|$|Nureddin {{chose to}} set his {{defenses}} at the Es Sinn, a bend along the Tigris south of Kut al Amarra. On the north or left bank, <b>he</b> <b>dug</b> in the {{troops of the}} 38th Division {{in a series of}} two networks. Both were anchored on the Tigris River, one extended to Suwada Marsh and the other ended in Ataba Marsh. The Suwada and Ataba marshes were considered impassable swamps. Their size, even in the dry months of late summer and early autumn were thought to make them effective barriers to any large scale enveloping maneuver. To the south of the Tigris, Nureddin constructed another series of trench-works, extending from the river to a strong redoubt. Although the southern trench lines were not anchored by impassable obstacles, the position was on some of the only elevated ground around, giving it an excellent field of fire. What reserves Nureddin did have, he would retain five miles upriver. A floating bridge would allow him to shift forces rapidly, but they would have to make a five-mile march to the fighting to be of use.|$|E
50|$|Although a {{minority}} opposed William Horn, on August 11, 1936 his claims {{appeared to have}} been corroborated when he announced that <b>he</b> had <b>dug</b> up two lead plates dated 1795 in a location predicted by the papers.|$|R

25|$|Thomas's {{forces were}} divided: half {{were with him}} in Nashville {{and the other half}} with John M. Schofield, moving in pursuit from Atlanta, with other troops due to arrive from the Red River Campaign. Hood hoped to defeat Schofield before he could join forces with Thomas and before the {{reinforcements}} from Louisiana arrived. He had the chance at the Battle of Spring Hill in Tennessee (November 29, 1864), but the Union troops were able to slip through the trap, due to the Confederate failure to cut the Columbia-to-Franklin turnpike in the Union rear. At the Battle of Franklin the following day, Hood launched repeated massive frontal assaults against strong entrenchments and suffered severe casualties. David J. Eicher wrote that Hood mortally wounded his army at Franklin but killed it at the Battle of Nashville (December 1516). At Nashville, facing the combined force of Schofield and Thomas, <b>he</b> <b>dug</b> in a few miles south of the city and waited, hoping that Thomas would wreck his army on the Confederate fortifications. After a two-week preparation period in winter weather, during which he received great pressure from Grant and the Union government to attack, Thomas unleashed an overwhelming assault that sent Hood and his survivors in retreat to Franklin and then to Mississippi, never to recover as a fighting force. By his own request, Hood was relieved of command of the Army of Tennessee and Lt. Gen. Richard Taylor was appointed temporary commander of the army.|$|E

It is now at the museum Gotlands fornsal with inventory number C 9181. It has been dated to the late 11th century, and although the interpretation of its message is uncertain, scholars have generally accepted von Friesen's analysis that it commemorates the travels of two Gotlanders to Greece, Jerusalem, Iceland and the Muslim world (Serkland).|$|E
2500|$|Immediately after Cram had {{completed}} his testimony, Michael Rossi himself testified for the state.

500|$|Weighing [...] as a newborn, Kemper {{was already}} a head taller than his peers {{by the age of}} four. He was also {{intelligent}} but exhibited antisocial and psychopathic behavior such as cruelty to animals. At the age of 10, he buried a pet cat alive and once it had died, <b>he</b> <b>dug</b> it up, decapitated it and mounted its head on a spike. Kemper later stated that he derived pleasure from successfully lying to his family and about killing the cat. At the age of 13, he killed another family cat when he perceived it to be favoring his younger sister, Allyn Lee Kemper (born 1951), over him. He kept pieces of it in his closet until his mother found them.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a plaque}} on a {{monument}} in the Cimetière des Chiens pet cemetery which states, [...] "Il sauva la vie à 40 personnes.

The story goes that news had come that a Swiss soldier {{was lost in the}} mountains. Barry was searching for the soldier and had picked up the scent, some forty-eight hours old, and finally stopped before a large bank of ice. <b>He</b> <b>dug</b> until he reached the soldier, and then licked him as he was trained. The Swiss soldier awoke startled and mistook Barry for a wolf and fatally stabbed him with his bayonet. James Watson in his 1906 work The Dog Book attributed the rumour to fellow author Idstone, also known as Reverend Thomas Pearce.|$|E

500|$|According to oral history, Andriamasinavalona was {{temporarily}} usurped through the trickery {{of his son}} Andriantomponimerina, who ruled the western territory from his rova at Ambohidratrimo. Once Andriamasinavalona's sons had been installed in their territories, Andriantomponimerina tested his authority by imposing a particular hairstyle upon the Marovatana people he ruled, in disregard of the promise that the king had made to respect the diverse customs and taboos of Imerina. The Marovatana reminded the king of this vow and refused to submit, prompting the king and his sons to prepare for war against {{the people of the}} fief. This conflict provided the prince with an opportunity to seize power. Upon the suggestion of the prince's half-brother, Andrianentoarivo, the prince hid himself in a trench <b>he</b> <b>dug</b> into the dirt floor of his royal residence at Ambohidratrimo, then ordered his people to send word to his father that he was [...] "in the ground". Believing his son to be buried alive by the Marovatana as a punitive measure, Andriamasinavalona hurried to Ambohidratrimo carrying reeds as a symbol of peace; upon the king's entrance into the residence, however, Prince Andriantomponimerina locked Andriamasinavalona inside and refused to release him for the next seven years. During this time the prince repeatedly offered to free the king on the condition that Andriamasinavalona accept to transfer power to him, which the king repeatedly refused. Andriantomponimerina prevented his brothers from taking action against him by telling their messengers that the king simply preferred his company and had decided to reside with him at Ambohidratrimo.|$|E
500|$|On the {{way back}} to the ashram, Uttanka had tied the {{earrings}} in a deerskin. While travelling, he stopped and climbed a tree to pluck some fruit for his refreshment. He tied the deerskin to a branch, but the deerskin became untied and the earrings fell on the ground. A snake immediately got hold of the earrings and vanished into an ant-hill. In grief, Uttanka fell from the tree. For 35 days, <b>he</b> <b>dug</b> the ant-hill with a stick to get the snake out and retrieve the earrings. The earth began to shake due to the repeated strikes. At that time, Indra– riding his chariot– saw Uttanka's futile efforts. As in the Adi Parva, Indra used his Vajra to enable Uttanka to enter the beautiful Nagaloka. There, Uttanka saw a horse with the [...] "tail which had black and white hair, a copper-coloured muzzle, and eye of the same colour that seemed to flame forth in splendor". The horse told Uttanka to blow from behind, as in the Adi Parva version. The horse was the fire god Agni who was the guru of Gautama, who had offered his help to retrieve the earrings. When Uttanka followed the directive of the horse, flames and smoke emerged from every pore of the horse and choked the dwellings of the snakes. Thus choked, the serpents, headed by Vasuki came out, worshipped Uttanka and surrendered the earrings and asked that they be pardoned. When Uttanka returned to the hermitage of Gautama to give the earrings to Ahalya, he narrated the sequence of events that occurred in procuring the earrings.|$|E
