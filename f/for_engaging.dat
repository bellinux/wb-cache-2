5|$|In Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking, Palmer {{examines}} whether process philosophy, {{in particular}} the philosophies of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne, can provide an appropriate background <b>for</b> <b>engaging</b> in environmental ethics. Process thought, Clark notes, has frequently appealed more to theologically-inclined environmental ethicists than classical theism; in particular, the views of Hartshorne and Cobb have been influential.|$|E
5|$|Gerard Libaridyan, an {{historian}} and close adviser of Ter-Petrosyan, collected and presented {{the evidence against}} the defendants. He later stated {{in an interview that}} he was unsure if the evidence was true, inviting the notion that the party was banned because of its increasing chances of winning seats in the July 1995 parliamentary elections. Several months after the elections, most of the men were found not guilty with the exception of several defendants charged <b>for</b> <b>engaging</b> in corrupt business practices. The ban on the party was lifted, however, less than a week after Ter-Petrosyan fell from power in February 1998 and was replaced by Robert Kocharyan, who was backed by the Dashnaks.|$|E

5|$|The only internationally {{recognized}} authority for naming celestial bodies is the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The International Astronomical Union maintains the Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) which catalogs and standardizes proper names for stars. A number of private companies sell names of stars, which the British Library calls an unregulated commercial enterprise. The IAU has disassociated itself from this commercial practice, and these names are neither {{recognized by the}} IAU, professional astronomers, nor the amateur astronomy community. One such star-naming company is the International Star Registry, which, during the 1980s, was accused of deceptive practice for making it appear that the assigned name was official. This now-discontinued ISR practice was informally labeled a scam and a fraud, and the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs issued a violation against ISR <b>for</b> <b>engaging</b> in a deceptive trade practice.|$|E
5|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Supreme Court, Justice Stephen Breyer stated that the department's belief was all that mattered, since the Court's precedent in this area holds it is unconstitutional for a government agency to discipline an employee (who does not work under a contract that explicitly permits such discipline) <b>for</b> <b>engaging</b> in partisan political activity, as long as that activity is not disruptive to the agency's operations. Even if Heffernan was not engaging in protected speech, he wrote, the discipline against him sent a message to others to avoid exercising their rights. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Justice Samuel Alito, in which he agreed that Heffernan had been harmed, but his constitutional rights had not been violated.|$|E

5|$|Three years later, when Elsa {{becomes a}} young adult, she {{is set to}} be crowned queen. The people of Arendelle are joyously {{preparing}} for her coronation day. Anna is flushed with excitement as the castle gates are opened {{for the first time}} since the sisters' childhood. The young princess expresses how cheerful she is when she leaves her lonely life and meets people, as well as her hopes to find romance and a love interest. While exploring the town, Anna bumps into a horse owned by Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Despite the awkward meeting at first, the pair quickly get acquainted and develop a mutual attraction for each other. Though Elsa fears of her secret being revealed to the public, her coronation goes on without incident. At the reception party, Anna is offered a waltz from Hans and the two have a date around the kingdom. They later find out that they have much in common, and Anna agrees to Hans' marriage proposal. Anna asks for Elsa's blessing to marry Hans, but she refuses and criticizes her <b>for</b> <b>engaging</b> with someone she has just met. This raises an argument between the two with Anna losing her temper, culminating in Elsa getting angry and accidentally exposing her abilities. Upon the guests' (including Anna) horrified reactions, Elsa flees the castle in panic and goes into hiding in the icy mountains. During her retreat, she inadvertently unleashes an eternal winter throughout Arendelle. Far from there, Elsa decides to let go her powers and build an enormous ice palace. Anna, believing it's her fault, determines to find her sister and bring her back, leaving Hans in charge of Arendelle.|$|E

30|$|Goldhammer et al. (2016) {{investigated}} {{whether the}} P +> 0 % indicator of disengaged response {{behavior can be}} considered valid, which requires the indicator to identify responses with no chance for success (e.g., due to rapid guessing or because the time spent on the item was below the minimum allowing for success above chance level). Following the procedures described by Lee and Jia (2014), they determined the average proportion correct <b>for</b> <b>engaged</b> versus disengaged response behavior across items (and additionally by item) for each construct, {{as well as the}} correlations between score group and proportion correct <b>for</b> <b>engaged</b> and disengaged response behavior by item. One example of their findings is that the proportion correct <b>for</b> <b>engaged</b> responses in literacy, numeracy, and problem solving were 0.56, 0.63 and 0.43, respectively, in comparison to 0 for disengaged responses by definition according to the P +> 0 % method. Compared to other methods specifying constant thresholds of 5000 or 3000  ms, or item-specific thresholds obtained by inspecting visually the (bimodal) response time distribution, the P +> 0 % method resulted in the greatest difference in proportion correct <b>for</b> <b>engaged</b> versus disengaged responses, suggesting that the method separates disengaged and engaged responses very well. Taken together, these validity checks indicate that the P +> 0 % indicator can validly be interpreted as a measure of test-taking disengagement.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} purposes, {{definitions}} and criteria designed to embed ‘engaged research’ as a strategic priority with universities, and explores some of the challenges of implementation. Surveys of academics have shown various understandings of, and attitudes to, the practices of engaged research, but also impediments to realising the aspirations it expresses. Drawing on the experience as the academic lead <b>for</b> <b>engaged</b> research at the Open University, the author explores questions of professionalisation, for example, through training, support mechanisms and measures of recognition <b>for</b> <b>engaged</b> research. He concludes by arguing that, if done well, engaged research can promote epistemic justice...|$|R
