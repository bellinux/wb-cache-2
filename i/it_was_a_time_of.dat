5|$|Brian Lamb, C-SPAN's {{chairman}} and {{former chief executive}} officer, first conceived the concept of C-SPAN in 1975 while working as the Washington, D.C. {{bureau chief of the}} cable industry trade magazine Cablevision. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> rapid {{growth in the number of}} cable television channels available in the United States, and Lamb envisioned a cable-industry financed nonprofit network for televising sessions of the U.S. Congress and other public affairs event and policy discussions. Lamb shared his idea with several cable executives, who helped him launch the network. Among them were Bob Rosencrans who provided $25,000 of initial funding in 1979 and John D. Evans who provided the wiring and access to the headend needed for the distribution of the C-SPAN signal.|$|E
5|$|Bridge Street {{remained}} {{the home of}} the Echo for the next 100years. Old buildings were demolished, new machine and composing rooms built on West Wear Street and two rotary presses installed just before the move, each capable of printing 24,000copies an hour. These changes brought about increased circulation, but it took another seven years before the Echo made a profit. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> intense competition; the Sunderland Times converted from a bi-weekly to a daily paper in the same month as the Echo moved to Bridge Street, and Tory supporters started a paper of their own, the Sunderland Daily Post. The Sunderland Times was the first to collapse, but the Post survived for the next quarter of a century, providing the Echo with an often bitter rival.|$|E

25|$|The {{collapse}} of the Zhou initiated the Spring and Autumn period, named after Confucius' Spring and Autumn Annals. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> war between states, when the earlier semi-feudal system fell into decline and trade began to flourish.

25|$|The sudden {{spread of}} the rumours {{in the spring of}} 1915, six months after the events and Machen's story was {{published}}, is also puzzling. The stories published then often attribute their sources to anonymous British officers.

As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> allied problems with the Lusitania sinking, Zeppelin attacks and failure to achieve a breakthrough on the Western Front, the timing would make military sense.

40|$|Disasters {{are usually}} {{identified}} as having occurred at <b>a</b> particular <b>time</b> and place but they also occur at <b>a</b> particular <b>time</b> in human history and within a specific social and cultural context.

In 450, Emperor Taiwu once again attacked the Liu Song and reached Guabu (瓜步, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu), threatening to cross the river to attack Jiankang, the Liu Song capital. Though up to this point, the Northern Wei military forces dominated the Liu Song forces, they took heavy casualties. The Northern Wei forces plundered numerous households before returning north.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} the Helvetic Republic is still very {{controversial}} within Switzerland.

For the first time the population was defined as Swiss, not as members of a specific canton. For cantons like Vaud, Thurgau and Ticino the Republic was a time of political freedom from other cantons. However the Republic also marked a time of foreign domination and revolution. For the cantons of Bern, Schwyz and Nidwalden <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> military defeat followed by occupation. In 1995 the Federal Parliament chose to not celebrate the 200 year anniversary of the Helvetic Republic, but to allow individual cantons to celebrate if they wished.|$|E

He had been shot in the chest at point blank range. Two people were arrested, an ex-Gurkha who had been out shooting at the time, and the man whose gun he had been using. There was no apparent motive and no charges were ever brought because both men seemed to have alibis.|$|E
