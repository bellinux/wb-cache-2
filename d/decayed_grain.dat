40|$|A {{multiple}} sensor {{machine vision}} prototype {{is being developed}} to scan full size hardwood lumber at industrial speeds for automatically detecting features such as knots, holes, wane, stain, splits, checks, and color. The prototype integrates a multiple sensor imaging system, a materials handling system, a computer system, and application software. The prototype provides a unique general purpose research facility so {{that a variety of}} different industry-scale problems can be addressed in both primary and secondary hardwood manufacturing. BACKGROUND There are three main categories into which features on hardwood lumber may be classified. These are: 1) visual surface features (e. g. knots holes, splits, <b>decay,</b> color, <b>grain</b> orientation), 2) board geometry features (e. g., warp, crook, wane, thickness variations, voids), and 3) internal features (e. g., honeycomb, voids, decay). Surface geometric, and internal features have been categorized in this way because they often require different detection methods that depend on where they appear. Most of these features are treated as defects to be removed in the manufacturing process. Current hardwood mill operations examine lumber manually to locate and identify these types of defects. ...|$|R

Higher quality wooden pallets, however, {{can be built}} from high quality deckboards and stringers, and have a much longer life cycle and a lower cost per trip. The long-term goal of this project is to develop an automated pallet part inspection system to sort pallet parts according to grade.

Rolling transducers of 3 different frequencies (84 KHz, 0. 5 MHz, and 1. 25 MHz) have been used to collect measurements on four oak deckboards of 1 / 2 ” thickness. Ultrasonic C-scans taken on a 1 / 2 ” × 1 / 2 ” grid indicate that TOF with 84 KHz transducers can be used to partially distinguish between several deckboard features and clear wood.

40|$|We study {{universality}} {{classes and}} crossover behaviors in non-Abelian directed sandpile models, {{in terms of}} the metastable pattern analysis. The non-Abelian property induces spatially correlated metastable patterns, characterized by the algebraic <b>decay</b> of the <b>grain</b> density along the propagation direction of an avalanche. Crossover scaling behaviors are observed in the grain density due to the interplay between the toppling randomness and the parity of the threshold value. In the presence of such crossovers, we show that the broadness of the grain distribution plays a crucial role in resolving the ambiguity of the universality class. Finally, we claim that the metastable pattern analysis is important as much as the conventional analysis of avalanche dynamics.

The data showed that only 40 - 60 % of the initial S cohort completed mitosis and entered the succeeding cycle. About 20 - 35 % of the S cohort left the cycle for long residence in G 2, and 20 - 40 % of the residual S cohort, after mitosis, remained in G 1 for long intervals. Cells subsequently re-entered the cycle from both nonproliferative compartments. The growth fraction was 39 %, and the cells in G 2 0 and in G 1 0 were 38 % and 23 % of the population, respectively. The transit times of two-thirds of the G 1 0 cells were greater than 13 days, and for two-thirds of the cells in G 20 the transit times exceeded 1 week.

40|$|Granular {{materials}} are collections of particles whose sizes range from microns to meters. They can be packed as a static solid pile {{and can also}} move like fluid or gas. When driven at a sufficiently low rate under a compressive load, the grains flow in a quasi-static regime, in which they creep while maintaining simultaneous contacts with multiple neighbors. ^ We investigate experimentally a quasi-static flow of glass beads packed and sheared in an annular channel. The experiments utilize techniques of refractive-index-matched fluorescent imaging, particle tracking, and simultaneous measurements of volume and boundary shear force. Under long-term shearing, a crystallization transition accompanied by a stepwise decrease of packing volume and shear force can occur. This transition also alters {{the structure of the}} internal velocity field. Boundary conditions can affect the crystalline ordering throughout the entire packing. We find that, even under identical boundary conditions and shearing, the evolution of the packing can lead to non-unique final states. The behavior in response to shearing is influenced by the past history of the packing. ^ Our measurements of the internal velocity fields have a dynamical range of five decades; parameters such as packing thickness and particle size are varied systematically. We demonstrate that crystalline ordering has {{a significant impact on the}} spatial gradient of grain velocity. Changing particle size does not influence the gradient of particle velocity significantly; the velocity decay length does not show a direct scaling with particle size. We also make time-resolved measurements of the internal flows in response to cyclic shearing, and investigate the anomalous motility of individual grains in response to the reversal of boundary motion. Our observations of both steady and transient states illustrate that sufficient packing thickness is needed to reveal bulk properties, such as the shear banding of velocity field, the development of distinct states of internal order, and the anomalous mobility upon shear reversal. In addition, by analyzing the measurements in this and other experimental systems of granular shear flows, we argue that the spatial <b>decay</b> of <b>grain</b> velocity should be geometry-specific; a heuristic model is proposed to explain the shear banding in this geometry. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{improved}} timber grading {{is key to}} improving Scottish forestry: the majority (80 %) of the sustainable softwood population in Scotland is Sitka spruce of variable quality. Current visual assessment of strength and stiffness is inaccurate, and machine stress grading in sawmills is little better due to incorrect assumptions regarding consistency within softwood species and between trees of the same stand. The author develops and evaluates non-destructive test (NOT) methods for Scottish Sitka spruce based upon impact-e 9 ho testing {{across a range of}} scales from plank, to log, to standing tree. Correlations between harmonic wave propagation velocity and elastic modulus of 0. 62 ::; R 2 ::; 0. 71 were possible in Sitka spruce under a range of conditions including: genotype progeny, variable height and radial position in stem, and variable knot content. In achieving this correlation, the research also investigated acoustic parameters such as: time of flight velocity, damping ratio, and resonant peak behaviour with regard to their influence on dynamically derived moduli of elasticity. Examination of variation in wood properties (including static elastic modulus, knot content, simulated <b>decay,</b> density, and <b>grain</b> alignment) on these acoustic parameters was conducted on semi-controlled specimens of differing homogeneities. The consequences of these results should influence the development of timber NOT tools.

40|$|We {{measured}} the He and Ne concentrations of 50 individual extraterrestrial chromite grains recovered from mid-Ordovician (lower Darriwilian) sediments from the Lynna River section near St. Petersburg, Russia. High concentrations of solar wind-like He and Ne {{found in most}} grains indicate that they were delivered to Earth as micrometeoritic dust, while their abundance, stratigraphic position and major element composition indicate an origin related to the L chondrite parent body (LCPB) break-up event, 470 Ma ago. Compared to sediment-dispersed extraterrestrial chromite (SEC) grains extracted from coeval sediments at other localities, the grains from Lynna River are both highly concentrated and well preserved. As in previous work, in most grains from Lynna River, high concentrations of solar wind-derived He and Ne impede a clear quantification of cosmic-ray produced He and Ne. However, we have found several SEC grains poor in solar wind Ne, showing a resolvable contribution of cosmogenic 21 Ne. This makes it possible, for the first time, to determine robust cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) ages in these fossil micrometeorites, {{on the order of}} a few hundred-thousand years. These ages are similar to the CRE ages measured in chromite grains from cm-sized fossil meteorites recovered from coeval sediments in Sweden. As the CRE ages are shorter than the orbital <b>decay</b> time of <b>grains</b> of this size by Poynting-Robertson drag, this suggests that the grains were delivered to Earth through direct injection into an orbital resonance. We demonstrate how CRE ages of fossil micrometeorites can be used, in principle, to determine sedimentation rates, and to correlate the sediments at Lynna River with the fossil meteorite-bearing sediment layers in Sweden.

40|$|The two Voyager {{spacecraft}} discovered small-scale, radially-extended {{features in}} the central region of Saturn's B Ring. These "spokes" are "clouds" of submicron-size ice grains which are electrostatically levitated above the ring plane and which appear to travel about Saturn in Keplerian orbits (Smith et al., 1981, Science 212, 163 - 191). This research project is {{a study of the}} dynamical and physical properties of spokes as deduced from Voyager Saturn ring images. An analysis of the orbital motion of two dynamically-anomalous spokes, in particular, has set limits on the charge-to-mass ratios of spoke particles at various times during their dynamical evolution. These two spokes have charge-to-mass ratios of at least - 60 ± 3 C kg⁻¹ while corotating with Saturn, and charge-to-mass ratios of no more than - 22 ± 2 C kg⁻¹ while orbiting Saturn at Keplerian velocities. Additionally, charge <b>decay</b> on the <b>grains</b> of these spokes, caused by solar UV photoemission, has allowed a lower limit of 0. 10 ± 0. 03 μm to be placed on the range of radii for spoke particles. In a study of spoke photometry, a single-scattering analysis of the 0. 470 -μm phase function for spokes has set a mean radius for the dominant scatterers (at this wavelength) of 0. 22 ± 0. 02 μm. Also, a multispectral analysis of spokes has determined the spectral index of the size distribution for spoke particles to be 2. 1 ± 0. 2. These dynamical and physical properties of spokes have been combined with theoretical explanations of spoke activity to develop a phenomenological model of spoke formation and evolution. The transport of angular momentum within the rings due to the radial motion of spoke grains is shown to be the most significant effect of spoke activity on the dynamical evolution of the B Ring, as was predicted by Goertz et al.

40|$|Graphene has a {{wide variety}} of {{properties}} that are extremely unique among materials. Due to its thickness of only a single atomic layer, defects in the crystal structure have an extraordinarily large impact on the resulting properties of the graphitic film. ^ First I examine the graphene growth process in two different growth regimes. The first is traditional catalytic thermal chemical vapor deposition. This process produces large grains of graphene with a very low density of defects. In this regime the defect concentration, specifically grain boundaries, can be controlled through surface treatments, growth temperature, growth pressure and precursor flow rates in order to control the nucleation density and resultant grain size within the film. In the second regime a low temperature growth process using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition is explored. In this regime the resultant graphene has a very high defect density. The defect density and film composition and morphology can be controlled by the chemical properties of the growth substrate, precursor gas, plasma power and temperature. ^ Second I examine how the defects present in large crystal graphene effect the carrier properties using transient absorption. Grain boundaries were identified as the most relevant defect structure and characterized by using transient absorption imaging to probe the changes in the density of states that result from the defect structures. Grain boundaries were found to present a significant change in the density of states at an energy dependent on the angle at which the two grains interact. This results in a 30 % increase in the transient absorption signal intensity due to an optical resonance that results from the angular mismatch of the grains. Furthermore the transient absorption spectroscopy was used to demonstrate a faster carrier <b>decay</b> at the <b>grain</b> boundaries as a result of supercollision cooling. ^ Third I examine how defective graphene can be utilized as an anticorrosion coating. Single layer graphene provides excellent short term protection but the inevitability of defects in the film cause catastrophic failure over long time scales. Nanocrystalline graphene was shown to provide the same level of short term protection using electrochemical corrosion tests but is vastly superior to single layer graphene over longer time scales. By monitoring ion concentration in solutions and leaving samples exposed to atmosphere nanocrystalline graphene was shown to provide significantly better protection against corrosion when compared to single layer graphene. This is due to the inability of cracks in the film to propagate and passivation of diffusion pathways. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis apply High Resolution Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (HR-EBSD) {{technique}} {{to a variety}} of microstructure features and their interactions in pure h. c. p polycrystals. By correlating high quality Kikuchi patterns with a reference pattern, the relative state and distribution of strain, stress, and geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density can be obtained with high strain sensitivity (10 - 4) and angular resolution (10 radian). This technique is companied by a further investigation of subsurface features using Differential Aperture X-ray Micro-diffraction (DAXM) technique. The two technique have shown excellent agreement in capturing the magnitude and distribution of stress and GND. Stress field and GND distribution induced by slip band and grain boundary interactions, including blocked slip band with no observable slip transfer in SEM and slip transfer, were characterised. It was found that some blocked slip bands lead to high and localised stress concentration in the neighbouring grain while others did not, and no stress concentration were correlated with transferred slip bands. These three categories of interactions were rationalised using a slip transfer criteria (called LRB criteria) by investigating the geometric alignments between the impinging slip system and all possible slip systems in the neighbouring grain. The level of stress concentration were quantified into a stress intensity factor K, following the Frank, Eshelby, and Nabarro (FEN) model. It was found that the level of stress intensity correlates well with the number of dislocations within the pile up plane. The slip band and grain boundary interaction case that led to the highest magnitude of stress intensity factor was further investigated using DAXM experiments. The 3 D data set informed us additional information hidden below the sample surface. The distribution of stress concentration in 3 D is a ribbon conforming to the line of intersection between slip plane and grain boundary. Stress intensity factor calculation along this ribbon have shown large variations which led to a concern that sometimes 2 D results might not be conclusive. For example, if damage is observed in sample surface, {{there is a possibility that}} large populations of damage already exist below sample surface as a result of the stress fluctuations. The level of stress concentration and distribution measured by both HR-EBSD and DAXM agree with each other and 3 D lattice rotation gradient used in DAXM GND calculation was found to affect the range of GND distribution and how fast it <b>decays</b> away from <b>grain</b> boundary. Twinning is a deformation mechanism in HCP metal that is equally important as dislocation slip. The stress concentrations associated with twin propagation, approaching grain boundary, and thickening were characterised using HR-EBSD, from which the calculated stress tensor were used to generate a local Schmid factor (LSF) map. It was found that during twin propagation, local positive shear provides a favourable LSF condition that promote twin tip extension while supress it from thicken. When twin tip is approaching the grain boundary, the positive shear stress field no longer favour twin propagation, a narrow positive LSF field still exist at the tip of twin, promoting it to grow thick. During propagation and thickening process, the LSF seem to only affect the tip of twins and therefore these processes are possibly tip controlled. </p...|$|R

How it began by being molten fire underground, how then it became part of a hard cold rock, lifted up into a cliff, beaten upon by rain and storm, and washed down into the soil of the plain, till, perhaps, the little atom of mineral met with the rootlet of some great tree, and was taken up into its sap in spring, through tiny veins, and hardened the next year into a piece of solid wood. And then how that tree was cut down, and its logs, it may be, burnt upon the hearth, till the little atom of mineral lay among the wood-ashes, and was shovelled out and thrown upon the field and washed into the soil again, and taken up by the roots of a clover plant, and became an atom of vegetable matter once more. And then how, perhaps, a rabbit came by, and ate the clover, and the grain of mineral became part of the rabbit; and then how a hawk killed that rabbit, and ate it, and so the grain became part of the hawk; and how the farmer shot the hawk, and it fell perchance into a stream, and was carried down into the sea; and when its body <b>decayed,</b> the little <b>grain</b> sank through the water, and was mingled with the mud {{at the bottom of the}} sea. But do its wanderings stop there? Not so, my child. Nothing upon this earth, as I told you once before, continues in one stay.

Slowly, perhaps, she would sink that mud so deep, and cover it up with so many fresh beds of mud, or sand, or lime, that under the heavy weight, and perhaps, too, under the heat of the inside of the earth, that Mud would slowly change to hard Slate Rock; and ages after, it may be, Madam How might melt that Slate Rock once more, and blast it out; and then through the mouth of a volcano the little grain of mineral might rise into the open air again to make fresh soil, as it had done thousands of years before. For Madam How can manufacture many different things out of the same materials. She may have so wrought with that grain of mineral, that she may have formed it into part of a precious stone, and men may dig it out of the rock, or pick it up in the river-bed, and polish it, and set it, and wear it.
