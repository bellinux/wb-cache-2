40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fast method for determining an approximation of the <b>local</b> <b>penetration</b> information for intersecting polyhedral models. As opposed to most techniques, this algorithm requires no specific {{knowledge of the}} object’s geometry or topology, or any pre-processing computations. In order to achieve real-time performance even for complex, nonconvex models, we decouple the computation of the <b>local</b> <b>penetration</b> directions from the computation of the corresponding <b>local</b> <b>penetration</b> depths: for any pair of intersecting objects, we partition the penetrating zones into coherent regions, and we determine {{for each of these}} regions a <b>local</b> <b>penetration</b> direction. Then, for each of these regions, we estimate a <b>local</b> <b>penetration</b> depth in the previously computed penetration direction. This method has been implemented and tested on a 2. 0 GHz Pentium PC with a NVIDIA GeForce FX 5900 graphics card with AGP 4 × and 768 MB of RAM. The examples indicate that a meaningful <b>local</b> <b>penetration</b> information can be computed for complex models and challenging intersection scenarios within a few milliseconds. ...|$|R

40|$|The rapid galvanostatic pulse {{technique}} was applied on site {{on a large}} number of measuring points with reinforcement varying from severely corroding to passive state. The measurements provide reliable results on corrosion potential, ohmic resistance and polarization resistance in very short time. The overall scatter of the data is not bigger than with any other instrumentation used for corrosion rate determination in the field. For actively corroding zones the current from the counter electrode is self-confined, no guard-ring is needed and the corrosion rate can be calculated {{on the basis of the}} reinforcement area under the counter-electrode. For passive zones the calculated “corrosion rate” is overestimated (on a very low level). Corrosion rate calculated from polarization resistance data are always instantaneous values. For engineering application (residual service life) the daily and seasonal changes in corrosion rate have to be considered. In the frequent case of chloride induced localized corrosion the <b>local</b> <b>penetration</b> rates calculated from Rp data can vary up to a factor of 5 – 10 and <b>local</b> <b>penetration</b> rates of 1 mm/year may occur.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{combined}} low voltage (LV) and medium voltage (MV) residential grid impact for slow and fast electric vehicle (EV) charging, for an increasing <b>local</b> <b>penetration</b> rate and for different residential slow charging strategies. A realistic case study for a Flemish urban distribution grid is used, for which three residential slow charging strategies are modeled: uncoordinated charging, residential off-peak charging, and EV-based peak shaving. For each slow charging strategy, the EV hosting capacity is determined, {{with and without}} the possibility of fast charging, while keeping the grid within its operating limits. The results show that the distribution grid impact is much less sensitive to the presence of fast charging compared to the slow charging strategy. EV-based peak shaving results in the lowest grid impact, allowing for the highest EV hosting capacity. Residential off-peak charging has the highest grid impact, due the load synchronization effect that occurs, resulting in the lowest EV hosting capacity. Therefore, the EV users should be incentivized to charge their EVs in a more grid-friendly manner when the <b>local</b> EV <b>penetration</b> rate becomes significant, as this increases the EV hosting capacity much more than the presence of fast charging decreases it.
