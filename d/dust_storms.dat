5|$|Drier {{parts of}} the country are highly prone to <b>dust</b> <b>storms.</b> These include areas west of Buenos Aires, which can average more than eight <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> per year, and parts of Patagonia, owing to its aridity and windy climate. Certain areas in the Altiplano are also highly prone to <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> owing to {{extensive}} areas of closed depressions and the presence of salt flats that erode the rock, which becomes a source of fine material that can travel large distances during periods of strong wind. <b>Dust</b> <b>storms</b> are more frequent during droughts, particularly in agricultural areas. <b>Dust</b> <b>storms</b> can effect large areas, leading to numerous impacts. These <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> can lead to loss of crop and livestock, affecting the local economy. Productive topsoil may be lost during <b>dust</b> <b>storms,</b> leading to loss in soil productivity, which can increase soil erosion and negatively affect crop productivity in the long term. In addition to the impact on agriculture, <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> can damage cars and buildings, lower visibility on roads, affect air quality, and affect water quality in rivers and lakes.|$|E

5|$|Mars has {{the largest}} <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> in the Solar System. These can vary from a storm over a small area, to {{gigantic}} storms that cover the entire planet. They tend to occur when Mars is closest to the Sun, and {{have been shown to}} increase the global temperature.|$|E
30|$|Fluctuations of <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> {{activity}} vary at {{the global}} scale (Goudie 2009; Shao et al. 2013). Among the three major <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> source regions—North Africa, the Middle East, and East Asia (Chen 2010; Creamean et al. 2013), an increasing trend of <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> outbreaks has been observed in North Africa (for example, the Sahel zone) and the Middle East (Goudie and Middleton 1992).

30|$|What is {{classified}} into the <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> class or the others is not each image but each patch. If patches into which an image is divided {{as shown in}} the “Basis determination” subsection are targets of classification, the shape of a <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> cannot be sufficiently resolved. Then, we shift a target patch, which {{is classified}} into one of the three classes in a test image, pixel by pixel, longitudinally, and latitudinally. An arbitrary pixel is basically included in N 2 target patches. Letting nD(i,[*]j) be the number of patches which include a current pixel (i, j) (i, j[*]∈[*]ℤ) and are categorized as a <b>dust</b> <b>storm,</b> we hereafter call nD(i,[*]j)/N 2 the “dust storm probability” of the pixel (i, j). An image whose pixel values are a <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> probability between 0 and 1 is obtained, which is called a “probability image” in this study. The shape and size of a <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> can be measured accurately by regarding pixels whose <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> probability is larger than a threshold value as the <b>dust</b> <b>storm.</b> Letting nC(i,[*]j) be the number of patches which include a current pixel (i, j) and are categorized as a cloud, we can also define the “cloud probability” of the pixel (i, j), nC(i,[*]j)/N 2.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In the {{existing}} Ka-band satellite channel model, the weather condition {{considered in the}} modeling are relatively ideal, so it can't be used to the <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> weather well. In order to establish the satellite channel model under the condition of <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> weather, the satellite channel propagation characteristic of <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> weather is analyzed firstly. Secondly, the several states of the satellite channel model in the <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> weather are divided by fuzzy clustering analysis method. Finally, Ka-Band satellite channel multi-state Markov model based on <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> weather and shadow multi-path effects is established and simulated. The simulation {{results show that the}} proposed Ka-band channel model is very agreeable with the measured data. Intorductoin The congestion of radio spectrum in the lower L/S bands and maturing of Ka-band technologies are causing a rush of interests in 20 / 30 GHz bands. Due to the Ka-band satellite communication system with widely bandwidth, large communication capacity, narrow beam, small terminal and strong ability to resist interference, it is very necessary to employ Ka-band satellite communication for carrying out effective communication in the future. However, the propagation of Ka-band satellite communication is susceptible to <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> weather and shadowing effect comparison with lower frequency satellite communication[1, 2]. Based on the former Ka-band satellite channel model, in this paper, first, the propagation characteristic of Ka-band satellite channel, such as the multipath, shadow, and <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> effect, are analyzed. Secondly, in view of the channel characteristics of the Ka-band satellite communication and fuzzy clustering analysis method, the Ka-band satellite channel multi-state Markov model based on <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> weather and shadow multi-path effects is established and simulated...|$|R
5|$|During the 1930s, several {{economic}} and climatic conditions combined with disastrous results for South Dakota. A lack of rainfall, extremely high temperatures and inappropriate cultivation techniques produced {{what was known}} as the Dust Bowl in South Dakota and several other plains states. Fertile topsoil was blown away in massive <b>dust</b> <b>storms,</b> and several harvests were completely ruined. The experiences of the Dust Bowl, coupled with local bank foreclosures and the general economic effects of the Great Depression, resulted in many South Dakotans leaving the state. The population of South Dakota declined by more than 7% between 1930 and 1940.|$|E

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{evolution of}} an East Asian <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> during 23 – 26 April 2009 was investigated by utilizing a regional air quality model system (RAQMS) and satellite measurements.

5|$|With the {{construction}} of canals, newly reclaimed Everglades land was promoted throughout the United States. Land developers sold 20,000lots {{in a few months}} in 1912. Advertisements promised within eight weeks of arrival, a farmer could be making a living, although for many it took at least two months to clear the land. Some tried burning off the sawgrass or other vegetation, only to learn that the peat continued to burn. Animals and tractors used for plowing got mired in the muck and were useless. When the muck dried, it turned to a fine black powder and created <b>dust</b> <b>storms.</b> Though initially crops sprouted quickly and lushly, they just as quickly wilted and died, seemingly without reason.|$|E
5|$|Round {{the rims}} of deserts, where more {{precipitation}} occurred and conditions were more suitable, some groups took to cultivating crops. This {{may have happened}} when drought caused the death of herd animals, forcing herdsmen to turn to cultivation. With few inputs, {{they were at the}} mercy of the weather and may have lived at bare subsistence level. The land they cultivated reduced the area available to nomadic herders, causing disputes over land. The semi-arid fringes of the desert have fragile soils which are at risk of erosion when exposed, as happened in the American Dust Bowl in the 1930s. The grasses that held the soil in place were ploughed under, and a series of dry years caused crop failures, while enormous <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> blew the topsoil away. Half a million Americans were forced to leave their land in this catastrophe.|$|E
5|$|For most of history, {{humanity}} did {{not recognize}} or {{understand the concept of}} the Solar System. Most people up to the Late Middle Ages–Renaissance believed Earth to be stationary at the centre of the universe and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky. Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos, Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop a mathematically predictive heliocentric system. In the 17th century, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton developed an understanding of physics that led to the gradual acceptance of the idea that Earth moves around the Sun and that the planets are governed by the same physical laws that governed Earth. The invention of the telescope led to the discovery of further planets and moons. Improvements in the telescope and the use of unmanned spacecraft have enabled the investigation of geological phenomena, such as mountains, craters, seasonal meteorological phenomena, such as clouds, <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> and ice caps on the other planets.|$|E

5|$|The storm sent a {{plume of}} {{moisture}} throughout the Arabian Peninsula, contributing to <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> {{as far north as}} Iraq. However, the effects were most severe in Yemen, becoming the second-worst natural disaster in the country after deadly floods in 1996. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in a normally arid region, reaching around , which caused flash flooding in valleys after waterways were unable to contain the approximately 2billionkm3 (528billion gallons) of water that fell. Poor drainage practices and an invasive species of weed contributed to the floods, which damaged or destroyed 6,505houses, leaving about 25,000people homeless. The floods killed 180people and severely disrupted the livelihoods of about 700,000residents of Hadhramaut and Al Mahrah governorates, mostly farmers whose fields were washed away. Some of the buildings at the Shibam UNESCO World Heritage Site collapsed due to the floods. Overall damage was estimated at US$874.8million, although residual losses from damaged infrastructure were estimated to cost an additional US$726.9million. The overall economic impact of the storm was therefore estimated at US$1.638billion, equating to roughly 6% of the country's gross domestic product.|$|E
5|$|These winds {{resulted}} in widespread agricultural, environmental and structural damage. Hundreds of structures sustained severe damage, mostly consisting of roofs blowing off. The most severe losses {{took place in}} Albany where most homes had partial or complete roof failure. Air-borne debris also damaged buildings during the storm. Nearly 80% of the apple crop {{was lost in the}} Donnybrook-Manjimup area. A total of 154,400m3 (5.4million ft3) of timber was lost as well as a potential 200,000m3 (7million ft3) of future growth on established trees. Widespread <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> also ruined crops and removed topsoil from many areas. Near the coast, the combined effects of strong, onshore winds and little rain led to significant inland sea spray. Numerous power lines and stations failed during the storm due to winds as well as dust and salt accretion. Large portions of the South-West Land Division were without electricity due to Cyclone Alby; Perth nearly sustained a complete breakdown of power services. This led to secondary losses attributable to the storm such as production failure.|$|E
5|$|About 92% of Bahrain is desert with {{periodic}} droughts and <b>dust</b> <b>storms,</b> {{the main}} natural hazards for Bahrainis. Environmental issues facing Bahrain include desertification {{resulting from the}} degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as Tubli Bay. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its salinisation by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified {{the locations of the}} sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of sabkha water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.|$|E
