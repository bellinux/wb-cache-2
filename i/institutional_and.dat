5|$|Religious {{views of}} {{conscience}} usually {{see it as}} linked to a morality inherent in all humans, to a beneficent universe and/or to divinity. The diverse ritualistic, mythical, doctrinal, legal, <b>institutional</b> <b>and</b> material features of religion may not necessarily cohere with experiential, emotive, spiritual or contemplative considerations about the origin and operation of conscience. Common secular or scientific views regard the capacity for conscience as probably genetically determined, with its subject probably learned or imprinted (like language) {{as part of a}} culture.|$|E
5|$|From around 1840, architects {{started to}} design wooden {{buildings}} {{in a new}} style, the so-called Swiss chalet style. The style and its name originated in Germany, where Swiss popular culture was much admired by the romanticists. Elements such as projecting roofs, verandas and emphasis on gables were inspired from Alpine vernacular buildings. But the style may more correctly be termed historicism in wood, a term introduced by Jens Christian Eldal. A number of residential, <b>institutional,</b> <b>and</b> commercial buildings were built in this style, characterized by ornate, projecting details. Railway stations and churches, designed by trained architects, were distributed all in rural districts and helped to make this style popular and to keep it alive in the vernacular tradition long after it went out of fashion among architects.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} short-run dynamic {{relation}} between daily <b>institutional</b> trading <b>and</b> stock price volatility in a retail investor-dominated emerging market. We find a significantly negative relation between volatility <b>and</b> <b>institutional</b> net trading that is mainly {{due to the}} unexpected institutional trading. The price volatility-institutional trade relation differs for <b>institutional</b> buys <b>and</b> <b>institutional</b> sells, <b>and</b> for small <b>and</b> large stocks. <b>Institutional</b> investors herd-trade in large stocks, but do not systematically engage in positive-feedback trading. We argue that the net impact of informational <b>and</b> noninformational <b>institutional</b> trades determines the relation between volatility <b>and</b> <b>institutional</b> trading, <b>and</b> that the relation is negative when informational trading by institutions prevails.

5|$|This {{subfield}} {{of sociology}} studies, broadly, {{the dynamics of}} war, conflict resolution, peace movements, war refugees, conflict resolution and military institutions. As a subset of this subfield, military sociology aims towards the systematic study of the military as a social group {{rather than as an}} organization. It is a highly specialized sub-field which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct group with coerced collective action based on shared interests linked to survival in vocation and combat, with purposes and values that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns civilian-military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies. Topics include the dominant assumptions held by those in the military, changes in military members' willingness to fight, military unionization, military professionalism, the increased utilization of women, the military industrial-academic complex, the military's dependence on research, and the <b>institutional</b> <b>and</b> organizational structure of military.|$|E
5|$|The ICSID {{does not}} conduct {{arbitration}} or conciliation proceedings itself, but offers <b>institutional</b> <b>and</b> procedural support to conciliation commissions, tribunals, and other committees which conduct such matters. The center has {{two sets of}} rules that determine how cases will be initiated and conducted, either under the ICSID's Convention, Regulations and Rules or the ICSID's Additional Facility Rules. To be processed {{in accordance with the}} ICSID Convention, a legal dispute has to exist between one of the center's contracting member states and a national of another contracting member state. It must also be of a legal nature and relate directly to an investment. A case can be processed under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules if one of the parties to the dispute is either not a contracting member state or a national of a contracting member state. However, most cases are arbitrated under the ICSID Convention. Recourse to ICSID conciliation and arbitration is entirely voluntary. However, once the parties have consented to arbitration under the ICSID Convention, neither party can unilaterally withdraw its consent.|$|E
