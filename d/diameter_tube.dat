25|$|Tube {{drawing is}} a process to size a tube by {{shrinking}} a large <b>diameter</b> <b>tube</b> into a smaller one, by drawing the tube through a die. This process produces high-quality tubing with precise dimensions, good surface finish, and the added strength of cold working. For this reason this process is established for many materials, namely metalworking but also glass. Because it is so versatile, tube drawing is suitable for both large- and small-scale production. The large-scale production of glass typically uses a one step process where glass is directly drawn into a tube from a melting tank.|$|E
25|$|The {{bottom bracket}} shell is a short and large <b>diameter</b> <b>tube,</b> {{relative}} to the other tubes in the frame, that runs side to side and holds the bottom bracket. It is usually threaded, often left-hand threaded on the right (drive) side of the bike to prevent loosening by fretting induced precession, and right-hand threaded on the left (non-drive) side. There are many variations, such as an eccentric bottom bracket, which allows for adjustment in tension of the bicycle's chain. It is typically larger, unthreaded, and sometimes split. The chain stays, seat tube, and down tube all typically connect to the {{bottom bracket shell}}.|$|E
2500|$|Fluorescent lamp {{tubes are}} {{typically}} straight and range in length from about [...] for miniature lamps, to [...] for high-output lamps. Some lamps have the tube bent into a circle, used for table lamps or {{other places where}} a more compact light source is desired. Larger U-shaped lamps are used to provide {{the same amount of}} light in a more compact area, and are used for special architectural purposes. Compact fluorescent lamps have several small-diameter tubes joined in a bundle of two, four, or six, or a small <b>diameter</b> <b>tube</b> coiled into a helix, to provide a high amount of light output in little volume.|$|E
50|$|Research on a heat {{exchanger}} redesign with 5-mm <b>diameter</b> <b>tubes</b> demonstrated a 5% greater heat exchange capacity {{than that of}} the same size {{heat exchanger}} with 7-mm <b>diameter</b> <b>tubes.</b> Also, the refrigerant charge of the 5-mm <b>diameter</b> <b>tubes</b> was less than the 7-mm <b>diameter</b> <b>tubes.</b> In China, Chigo, Gree, and Kelon are producing air conditioners with coils that have 5-mm <b>diameter</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Higher {{pressures}} are typically required to condense these new environmentally friendly refrigerants {{compared to those}} that are being phased out. Small <b>diameter</b> copper <b>tubes</b> are more desirable in applications with higher pressures. For tubes of the same thickness, smaller <b>diameter</b> <b>tubes</b> can withstand higher pressures than larger <b>diameter</b> <b>tubes.</b> Hence, as <b>tube</b> <b>diameters</b> decrease, burst pressures increase. This is because working pressure is directly proportional to wall thickness and inversely proportional to diameter. By designing coils with shorter tube lengths, less work is required to circulate the refrigerant. Therefore, refrigerant pressure drop factors due to small <b>diameter</b> <b>tubes</b> can be offset.|$|R

The drums could withstand the pressure by virtue of their robust construction. Manholes fitted to them allowed regular internal inspection.|$|R
2500|$|The {{solution}} to achieving a lethal concentration without releasing from cylinders was the [...] "gas projector", essentially a large-bore mortar that fired the entire cylinder as a missile. The British Livens projector (invented by Captain W.H.

By arranging a battery of these projectors and firing them simultaneously, a dense concentration of gas could be achieved. The Livens was first used at Arras on 4 April 1917. On 31 March 1918 the British conducted their largest ever [...] "gas shoot", firing 3,728 cylinders at Lens.|$|E

The primary structural element for the RV1 chassis will be a large <b>diameter</b> <b>tube</b> that houses the main LOX tank, the nitrogen tanks, the cockpit, the kerosene tank, and the rocket motors. The tube will also provide the attachment points for the forward LOX tanks, the wheels, the braking ballutes, and the body shell. It is currently planned for the tube to be of carbon fiber composite construction, although consideration is also being given to fabricating it using rolled and welded magnesium. Magnesium has the same density as carbon fiber, but is not as stiff and so {{would have to be}} thicker, as well as protected against corrosion from salt. The cockpit will be a sealed and self-contained capsule that drops in a compartment located near the midpoint of the vehicle.Mickey Thompson used a large <b>diameter</b> <b>tube</b> as a backbone for one of his Indy cars.
