A relation between the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> wind velocity must be considered. Using the concept of stream tube, the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine is 59% of the total theoretical wind power (see: Betz' law).|$|E

5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance, elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, mass, stiffness and damping. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements {{are used in the}} body of the filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output).</b> Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.|$|E

Each context shows an efficient frontier including DMUs in particular levels. The Context-dependent DEA with interval <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> <b>outputs</b> can measure (i) the attractiveness when DMUs showing weaker performance are selected as an appraisal context, and (ii) the interval progress when DMUs showing better performance are selected as the appraisal context.

5|$|The usual {{magnetostrictive}} {{materials used}} for the transducer are either ferrite or compressed powdered iron. Mechanical filter designs often have the resonators coupled with steel or nickel-iron wires, but on some designs, especially older ones, nickel wire may be {{used for the}} <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> rods. This is because it is possible to wind the transducer coil directly on to a nickel coupling wire since nickel is slightly magnetostrictive. However, it is not strongly so and coupling to the electrical circuit is weak. This scheme also has the disadvantage of eddy currents, a problem that is avoided if ferrites are used instead of nickel.|$|E
5|$|Culik {{begins with}} the {{observation}} that a cellular automaton has an injective transition function {{if and only if}} the transition function is injective on the subsets of configurations that are periodic (repeating the same substring infinitely often in both directions). He defines a nondeterministic finite-state transducer that performs the transition rule of the automaton on periodic strings. This transducer works by remembering the neighborhood of the automaton {{at the start of the}} string and entering an accepting state when that neighborhood concatenated to the end of the input would cause its nondeterministically chosen transitions to be correct. Culik then swaps the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> of the transducer. The transducer resulting from this swap simulates the inverse dynamics of the given automaton. Finally, Culik applies previously known algorithms to test whether the resulting swapped transducer maps each input to a single output.|$|E
5|$|For example, in most {{underdeveloped}} economies, {{the technology}} {{used to carry}} out agricultural activities is backward. There is a low degree of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence. So while {{a large proportion of}} the population (70-80%) may be actively employed in the agriculture sector, the contribution to the Gross Domestic Product may be as low as 40%. This points to the need to increase output per unit <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> per head. This can be done if the government provides irrigation facilities, high-yielding variety seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, tractors etc. The positive outcome of this is that farmers earn more income and have a higher purchasing power (real income). Their demand for other products in the economy will rise and this will provide industrialists an incentive to invest in that country. Thus, the size of the market expands and improves the condition of the underdeveloped country.|$|E

40|$|Data envelopment {{analysis}} (DEA) is a non-parametric data oriented {{method for}} evaluating relative {{efficiency of the}} number of decision making units (DMUs) based on pre-selected <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> <b>outputs.</b> In some real DEA applications, the large number of <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> <b>outputs,</b> in comparison with the number of DMUs, is a pitfall that could have major influence on the efficiency scores. Recently, an approach was introduced which aggregates collected <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> <b>outputs</b> {{in order to reduce the}} number of <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> <b>outputs</b> iteratively. The purpose of this paper is to show that there are three drawbacks in this approach: instability due to existence of an infinitesimal epsilon, iteratively which can be improved to just one iteration, <b>and</b> providing non-radial <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> <b>outputs</b> <b>and</b> then capturing them. In order to illustrate the applicability of the improved approach, a real data set involving 14 large branches of National Iranian Gas Company (NIGC) is utilized. Web of Science 27053352...|$|R
