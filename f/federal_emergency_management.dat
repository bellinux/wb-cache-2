40|$|Abstract. Social {{media and}} Internet-based {{messaging}} systems are increasingly important platforms for risk communication. A global audience turns to these tools to seek, disseminate, and curate time-sensitive, emergency information {{during periods of}} crisis. Moreover, <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> organizations report adopting these tools to augment their typical public information functions. Here, we use unsupervised machine learning methods and text analysis to explore online communications from a set of state and <b>Federal</b> <b>emergency</b> management-related organizations {{over a period of}} 15 months. We compare communication during routine, non-event periods with communication during significant disaster events in order to evaluate differences in the roles these organizations play. Findings indicate that communications from <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> organizations align based on functional roles during routine situations, but during crisis events communication strategies converge on a mutual objective. These results have important practical consequences for organizational learning within this environment and could inform social media policies for emergency responders...|$|R
5|$|According to the <b>Federal</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Management</b> Agency (FEMA), 1,464 residences {{throughout}} Texas {{were affected}} by Hurricane Humberto. Of these, 25 were destroyed, 96 sustained major damage and 240 sustained minor damage. The cost of individual assistance for those impacted by Humberto would cost $4,776,334; the cost of debris removal and other public assistance amounted to $6,682,074. In terms of per capita income, Jefferson County sustained the most impact, decreasing by $22.38.|$|E

40|$|State {{transportation}} {{agencies have}} a variety of responsibilities related to <b>emergency</b> <b>management.</b> Field personnel manage events [...] from day-to-day emergencies to disasters [...] using the Incident Command System (ICS) as their organizational basis. At the headquarters level, the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) coordinates the use of resources across the department and its districts, with other state departments and agencies, and through the <b>federal</b> <b>Emergency</b> Support Function 1. District-level EOCs coordinate with the department. In extreme events, the transportation department may only be able to deliver limited essential services in austere conditions, so a continuity of operations/ continuity of government plan (COOP/COG) is essential.

50|$|The American Red Cross {{estimated}} that over 200 {{people were in}} the areas affected by the floods {{at the time the}} floods hit. The missing were being searched for by National Guard helicopters. President Barack Obama pledged <b>federal</b> <b>emergency</b> assistance if it was required by Arkansas. <b>Emergency</b> <b>management</b> officials stated the search and rescue efforts would be difficult as the number of missing was unknown, and the missing were not necessarily confined to campsites. A logbook at the Albert Pike Recreational Area that would have helped track the whereabouts of hikers was swept away in the flood, leaving rescuers with little idea how many hikers could be missing. Rescue efforts were also hampered by roads rendered inaccessible by the flooding; some searchers used canoes or kayaks. A call center set up by the Arkansas Department of <b>Emergency</b> <b>Management</b> received inquiries in respect of 73 people who may have been missing.|$|R

30|$|Two {{kinds of}} <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> are {{discussed}} in this article: selective <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> and comprehensive <b>emergency</b> <b>management.</b> They are opposite concepts {{in terms of the}} entire direction of <b>emergency</b> <b>management.</b> Selective <b>emergency</b> <b>management,</b> which is newly named here, is a traditional type, whereas comprehensive <b>emergency</b> <b>management,</b> which is being widely practiced, is a modern type (FEMA, 2010 b: 2.5 â€“ 2.6; Zessin, 2006 : 8 â€“ 9). An increasing number of organizations have tried to utilize comprehensive <b>emergency</b> <b>management,</b> but many still rely on selective <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> under their own limited environments.|$|R
30|$|The term â€˜selectiveâ€™ means {{having the}} power or {{function}} of selecting. Selective <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> means that its components are not comprehensive but selective. Among so many emergency issues, selective <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> tends {{to apply for}} the participation of selective stakeholders in the process of <b>emergency</b> <b>management,</b> unequal support for selective phases of <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> lifecycle, and inclusion of selective hazards and impacts into <b>emergency</b> <b>management.</b> In other words, selective <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> comes to happen for the goal of managing not all issues but some imminent issues in the field, because of bounded personnel, resources, and strategies. However, {{it is also true that}} the some cases of <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> strategically rely on selective <b>emergency</b> <b>management,</b> though they have abundant personnel and resources.

5|$|Bush {{declared}} a state of emergency in Louisiana on August 27, and in Mississippi and Alabama the following day; he authorized the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and <b>Federal</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Management</b> Agency (FEMA) to manage the disaster, but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action. The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29, and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches; later that day, Bush declared that a major disaster existed in Louisiana, officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort.|$|E

Devastating in their own right, each disaster has led members of society to question the capability of local, state, and federal officials. The economic climate in the United States has placed <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> efforts and the progress made over the past few years in jeopardy. Significant budget cuts and limited funding provide many challenges to continue the progress in making communities safe, less vulnerable, and resilient in regards to disasters and catastrophic emergencies. This thesis proposes the use of increased collaborative arrangements, greater accountability, and the use of performance measures as ways to achieve greater efficiency to maximize <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> efforts under budget constraints. A better understanding of emergency plans and the effect it has had on varying levels of society will enable civic leaders an opportunity to improve existing emergency plans and reduce the potential for loss of life.
