5|$|Americium is {{paramagnetic}} {{in a wide}} temperature range, <b>from</b> <b>that</b> {{of liquid}} helium, to room temperature and above. This behavior is markedly different <b>from</b> <b>that</b> of its neighbor curium which exhibits antiferromagnetic transition at 52K. The thermal expansion coefficient of americium is slightly anisotropic and amounts to (7.5± 0.2)/°C along the shorter a axis and (6.2± 0.4)/°C for the longer c hexagonal axis. The enthalpy of dissolution of americium metal in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −620.6± 1.3kJ/mol, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔfH°) of aqueous Am3+ ion is −621.2± 2.0kJ/mol−1.
