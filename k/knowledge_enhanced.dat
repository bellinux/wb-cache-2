40|$|Long text {{brings a}} big {{challenge}} to semantic matching due to their complicated semantic and syntactic structures. To tackle the challenge, we consider using prior knowledge to help identify useful information and filter out noise to matching in long text. To this end, we propose a <b>knowledge</b> <b>enhanced</b> hybrid neural network (KEHNN). The model fuses prior knowledge into word representations by knowledge gates and establishes three matching channels with words, sequential structures of sentences given by Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and <b>knowledge</b> <b>enhanced</b> representations. The three channels are processed by a convolutional neural network to generate high level features for matching, and the features are synthesized as a matching score by a multilayer perceptron. The model extends the existing methods by conducting matching on words, local structures of sentences, and global context of sentences. Evaluation results from extensive experiments on public data sets for question answering and conversation show that KEHNN can significantly outperform the-state-of-the-art matching models and particularly improve the performance on pairs with long text...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} fully {{automatic}} minutiae extractor, called MinutiaeNet, based on deep neural networks with compact feature representation for fast comparison of minutiae sets. Specifically, first a network, called CoarseNet, estimates the minutiae score map and minutiae orientation based on {{convolutional neural network}} and fingerprint domain <b>knowledge</b> (<b>enhanced</b> image, orientation field, and segmentation map). Subsequently, another network, called FineNet, refines the candidate minutiae locations based on score map. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using the fingerprint domain knowledge together with the deep networks. Experimental results on both latent (NIST SD 27) and plain (FVC 2004) public domain fingerprint datasets provide comprehensive empirical support for the merits of our method. Further, our method finds minutiae sets that are better in terms of precision and recall in comparison with state-of-the-art on these two datasets. Given the lack of annotated fingerprint datasets with minutiae ground truth, the proposed approach to robust minutiae detection will be useful to train network-based fingerprint matching algorithms {{as well as for}} evaluating fingerprint individuality at scale.

40|$|Using a {{qualitative}} methodology and 2 authentic fables, {{the aim of}} this study was to describe the role of explicit moral points in fable reading. Previous research on ex-plicit summarizing statements has defined 3 potential functions of these statement types: activation of prior <b>knowledge,</b> <b>enhanced</b> integration of textual content, and refocusing of attention. Traditionally, explicit moral points in fables have been de-fined as having the additional function of persuading readers to accept a socially supported interpretation of human behavior. Ninety-nine adult readers read the nar-rative section of a fable and then gave written interpretations before and after read-ing the explicit moral point. The analysis of the written data revealed 7 different progressions of written categories, 4 of which can lead to a convergence of re-sponses toward the authorized explicit moral point. Results show that the explicit moral point fulfills the function of offering enhanced integration and refocusing of attention on new information.
