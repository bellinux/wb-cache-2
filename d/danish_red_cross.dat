25|$|Late in the war, after D-Day and the {{invasion}} of Normandy, the Nazis permitted representatives from the <b>Danish</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> and the International Red Cross to visit Theresienstadt in order to dispel rumours about the extermination camps. The commission that visited on June 23, 1944, included E. Juel-Henningsen, the head physician at the Danish Ministry of Health, and Franz Hvass, the top civil servant at the Danish Foreign Ministry. Dr. Paul Eppstein was instructed by the SS {{to appear in the}} role of the mayor of Theresienstadt.|$|E
25|$|According to Danish {{physician}} and historian Kirsten Lylloff, these deaths were partially due to denial {{of medical care}} by Danish medical staff, as both the Danish Association of Doctors and the <b>Danish</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> began refusing medical treatment to German refugees, starting in March 1945. The last refugees left Denmark on 15 February 1949. In the Treaty of London, signed 26 February 1953, West Germany and Denmark agreed on compensation payments of 160 million Danish crowns for its extended care of the refugees, which West Germany paid between 1953 and 1958.|$|E
25|$|Margrethe P. Rask (1930 – 12 December 1977), {{better known}} as Grethe Rask, was a Danish {{physician}} and surgeon in Zaïre (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). After setting up her own hospital in a village called Abumombazi in 1972, she transferred to <b>Danish</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> Hospital in Kinshasa in 1975. She returned to Denmark in 1977 after developing symptoms of an unknown disease, which was later discovered to be AIDS. Three {{and a half years}} later in June 1981 the Centers for Disease Control recognized AIDS. Rask was one of the first non-Africans (along with Arvid Noe) known to have died of AIDS-related causes.|$|E

25|$|With the Soviet Red Army's rapid {{approach}} {{in the spring of}} 1945, the SS leadership decided to remove as many prisoners as they could, in order to avoid leaving live witnesses behind who could testify as to what had occurred in the camp. At the end of March, the SS ordered all physically capable women to form a column and exit the camp in the direction of northern Mecklenburg, forcing over 24,500 prisoners on a death march. Some 2,500 ethnic German prisoners remaining were released, and 500 women were handed over to officials of the Swedish and <b>Danish</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> shortly after the evacuation. On 30 April 1945, fewer than 3,500 malnourished and sickly prisoners were discovered alive at the camp when it was liberated by the Red Army. The survivors of the death march were liberated in the following hours by a Russian scout unit.|$|E
2500|$|Born in 1930 in the Danish town of Thisted, Dr. Rask practiced {{medicine}} in Zaïre {{for a brief}} period in 1964, when she was recalled back to Europe for training in stomach surgery and tropical illnesses, and from 1972 to 1977, first at a small local hospital in the Zairian town of Abumombazi, and then at the <b>Danish</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> Hospital in Kinshasa starting in 1975. She was likely first exposed to HIV during 1964. Her friend and colleague, Ib Bygbjerg (a physician specializing in communicable diseases), wrote in a 1983 letter to The Lancet that [...] "while working as a surgeon under primitive conditions, she [...] must have been heavily exposed to blood and excretions of African patients." ...|$|E
