The duct structures between adjacent rafters and provides an intermediate partition between upper areas of rafters. There is also a radiation-transparent convection shield above the cover plate to stop heat being lost air movement.

40|$|In Korea, {{there is}} growing {{interest}} in the remodeling of aged apartment buildings. Traditionally, the <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> in Korea is a wet type floor <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> that utilizes radiation. But if a wet type floor <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> is installed in an aged apartment during its remodeling, some problems may occur. They include failure to secure enough ceiling height, to reduce level of floor impact noise and possibility that the load on the existing structure is increased. In other words, a wet type floor <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> {{may not be in}} compliance with the Korea building codes when it is used in remodeling of such apartment structures. Therefore, a prefabricated floor heating system which is thin and lightweight is suggested as an alternative to a wet type floor <b>heating</b> <b>panel.</b> In this research, first, the building codes that restrict, directly and indirectly, the prefabricated floor <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> for an apartment remodeling were investigated. Second, the available thickness of panel was calculated so that it complies with the building code, and it was found {{that there is a need}} to develop a new prefabricated floor <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> that can be installed in an aged apartment to be remodeled. Third, the design parameters of a floor <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> were classified and determined according to their role to design reasonably within the available thickness by studying the standards and technical documents...|$|E

It was used two methods of heating: classical, with infrared lamps and a floor heating panels. Surveys were taken {{during the winter months}} in the years 2006 - 2007, 2007 - 2008 and 2008 - 2009. The values of the microclimatic parameters in farrowing house were within the optimal norms for sows. Analysis of the investigating indicators of piglets welfare, as the parameters of the ambient environment and production results in farrowing house showed favorable values when the heating of piglets was with floor <b>heating</b> <b>panel.</b> So, the average value of the maximum air temperature for heating with floor heating panels was 28. 00 ± 3. 46 oC, versus 22. 25 ± 1. 50 oC for heating with the lamps. The temperature of the floor heating panels was 32 oC and the heating energy from the panels to the piglets was transmitted directly and more efficiently than with radiation. When the piglets heating were with the lamp, the number of live-born and weaned piglets was 11. 91 and 7. 85, respectively, or mortality to weaning amounted 35 %. The number of live-birborn and weaned piglets when the heating was with floor heating panels was 9. 99 and 8. 85, respectively, or mortality to weaning in this case amounted 11 %.

40|$|Purpose / Context –The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} indoor environment and energy saving performance of houses, which employ passive ventilation systems, built in mild climate region and hot humid region in Japan. Methodology / Approach – In this study, investigation of passive ventilation systems, such as passive stack ventilation systems and solar heating panels, have been conducted by two steps. The first step is real measurement of indoor environment and heating energy in houses employing passive ventilation systems. The second is analysis of total primary energy consumption of heating, cooling and ventilation by using a computational program based on the extended heating degree method. Results – From the measurement results, a passive ventilation system can be used in the regions from the viewpoint of the indoor environment. From the calculations results, a passive stack ventilation system with a self regulating damper yields less energy than typical mechanical ventilation systems. It is confirmed that a solar <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> have a positive effect on heating energy reduction even in hot humid region. Key Findings / Implications – In mild climate region, indoor environment of the house employing a passive stack ventilation system have almost met the reference values of the Act on Maintenance of Sanitation in Buildings in Japan.

30|$|For radiant cooling, {{using the}} ceiling as a thermal {{radiation}} surface, as compared {{to the floor}} or walls, is more advantageous in terms of thermal performance. Hence, there have been research reports (Sui et al. 2013) evaluating the thermal performances of radiant ceiling cooling systems for residential buildings. Radiant floor heating systems (RFHSs) using hot water are used as heating systems for most residential buildings in Korea, as this is the traditional heating system {{that has been used}} in Korea for residential buildings for a long time. Therefore, if an existing radiant floor <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> is used for space cooling, improvements in comfort and energy saving due to the basic characteristics of the RHCS can be expected. In addition, additional advantages include avoiding redundant investments in both heating and cooling installations, improving the disadvantage of system utilization (RFHS only during the winter season, and PAC only during the summer season), and the area occupied by the system can be reduced, because one terminal unit can deal with both space heating and cooling.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} apparatus (in-situ {{thermal test}} unit) and an analysis method {{have been developed}} for evaluating the thermal resistance of the building envelope on site. This system estimates the thermal resistance of a wall by heating the outside wall surface and measuring the surface heat fluxes and temperatures {{on both sides of the}} wall. The <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> is attached to the outside surface to avoid the effect of outside weather and to keep the surface temperature constant. The inevitable problem of this kind of testing method is, however, the error caused by the lateral heat loss. The error rate increases as the thickness of the envelope increases. In this study, a calibration method has been developed that is able to compensate for lateral heat loss. The calibration model was made up through simulation using 3 -dimensional heat flow calculation program (Voltra, Physibel). To validate this method, an experiment was conducted on mock-up blocks composed of insulation and bricks. The In-Situ measurement system adopting this calibration model could be expected to get more reliable results in evaluating thermal conductance on site...|$|E

30|$|The comfort {{requirements}} of the floor surface temperature also have to be satisfied, because when the existing radiant floor <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> is used for cooling, the floor surface used as the radiant cooling panel is {{in direct contact with}} the human body. Some studies and standards (Handbook American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers 2009; Olesen 2008; Standard American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers 2004; International Organization for Standardization 2012; Babiak et al. 2009; International Organization for Standardization 2005; Zhang et al. 2001) suggest the lower limit for an acceptable floor surface temperature to be around 17 – 21  °C. The REHVA guidebook (Babiak et al. 2009) provides an acceptable minimum surface temperature (19  °C) as well as a method of calculating the cooling capacity for each panel type. The cooling capacity of a Radiant Floor Panel (RFP) calculated based on this method may be insufficient for space cooling when considering the simulation result for cooling load in the above research (Jeong et al. 2007), the acceptable minimum floor surface temperature, and the effective installation area of the RFP. Thus, it can be inferred that supplementary cooling equipment is required in addition to the RFP.|$|E
30|$|Because the {{existing}} radiant floor <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> {{can be used}} as the radiant cooling panel, it has been determined that a radiant floor cooling panel for space cooling should be adopted for every thermal zone (each room). For the supplementary cooling equipment with dehumidification, installation in every room may lead to sufficient dehumidification and supplementary cooling, but this may be unreasonable in terms of cost, system control, maintenance, and required area, because of the multi-zone space. In Korea, most occupants’ activities are mainly carried out in the living room, and the doors of rooms connected to the living room are often left open. In addition, while bedrooms are mainly used during bedtime and have a relatively low latent load, a living room may have substantial latent load, because of the direct influence of cooking, laundry, and drying, as well as its proximity to the bathroom. Thus, it has been determined that supplementary cooling equipment with dehumidification should be installed in a representative room, such as a living room, rather than being installed in every room. This strategy is similar to {{the existing}} arrangement, in which the indoor unit of the PAC is installed in one or two representative rooms, such as the living room and/or the bedroom.|$|E
40|$|Radiant {{hydronic}} {{panels are}} heat exchangers particularly suitable for residential heating {{because of the}} higher energy saving and thermal comfort compared to traditional heating systems. As a consequence of these attractive features, interest in developing more efficient and less costly designs has strongly increased {{in the last few}} years, as demonstrated by the various approaches to predict design and off-design performance that have appeared in the literature. In this paper, a zero-dimensional model taken from the literature is improved to study the performance of a commercial radiant <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> in which the water tube is embedded in a solid conductive layer. The solid layer is included in the panel casing to improve heat transfer and smooth the surface temperature gradient. Heat transfer through the panel and along the radiant surfaces is modelled by a network of thermal resistances. The model allows the heat transfer in off-design steady-state conditions to be calculated for given values of all the network resistances. The off-design numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data provided by the panel manufacturer. Panel heat output is also calculated for several tube materials to show the capability of the model to evaluate the impact of the main design parameters on the panel performance...|$|E
