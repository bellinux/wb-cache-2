5|$|In their {{forty years}} of {{practice}} after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or journals. But those colleagues {{can be in the}} pay of drug companies– often undisclosed– and the journals are too. And so are the patient groups. And finally, academic papers, which <b>everyone</b> <b>thinks</b> of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure. Sometimes whole academic journals are even owned outright by one drug company. Aside from all this, for several of the most important and enduring problems in medicine, {{we have no idea what}} the best treatment is, because it's not in anyone's financial interest to conduct any trials at all.|$|E

Lex and Ryan agree to defend the newly formed tribe in exchange for shelter and food. They are soon joined by Bray and a heavily pregnant Trudy. Lex {{and the rest of}} the tribe members want Trudy gone, however Bray will not let them throw her out. Though the majority is against letting them stay, they change their mind once the baby is born. <b>Everyone</b> <b>thinks</b> that Bray is the father of Trudy's baby; however, Bray's brother, Zoot, is the father. Lex decides to call themselves the Mall Rats in a bonding ritual performed by the newly arrived, spiritual Tai-San.|$|E

25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players:I {{like to think that}} people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not really sure they're as good as <b>everyone</b> <b>thinks</b> they are. I think people tend to forget it wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5–1 by the Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against the Indians {{just a short time ago}} as well. Sure, they've got a couple of fast bowlers, but really I don't think we're going to run into anything more sensational than Thomson and Lillee and so really I'm not all that worried about them. You must remember that the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.|$|E
25|$|Drugs {{are tested}} {{by the people who}} {{manufacture}} them, in poorly designed trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques which are flawed by design, {{in such a way that}} they exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up results that companies don't like, they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug's true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in a drug's life, and even then they don't give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion. In their forty years of practice after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or journals. But those colleagues can be in the pay of drug companies – often undisclosed – and the journals are too. And so are the patient groups. And finally, academic papers, which <b>everyone</b> <b>thinks</b> of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure.|$|E

His [...] (Kitchen Botany), about the culinary uses of various vegetables, fruits and herbs, has not survived. The other was a {{cookbook}} with about 86 recipes, which was widely circulated in manuscript copies, {{at least two}} of which have been preserved. One of them, which bears a long, Baroque title translating as The exact study of the methods of cooking and preparing dishes of meat, fish, vegetables, flour, as well as seasoning of various sauces, making punch essence, etc., contains the author's humorous motto, [...] "not <b>everyone</b> <b>thinks,</b> but everyone eats."

In the season 13 (2009) episode [...] "Fishsticks", Cartman subconsciously believes that he helped in creating a joke that quickly becomes a nationwide sensation, {{despite the fact that the}} character Jimmy Valmer writes the joke without any assistance. Carlos Delgado of If Magazine noted this as [...] "Cartman being so egotistical that he manipulates the past to serve his own purposes".|$|E

[...] All songwriting is credited to the entire band, even though individual members are sometimes responsible for writing the majority of a particular song. Each member is given an equal vote in the songwriting process; however, Buck has conceded that Stipe, as the band's lyricist, can rarely be persuaded to follow an idea he does not favor. Among the original line-up, there were divisions of labor in the songwriting process: Stipe would write lyrics and devise melodies, Buck would edge the band in new musical directions, and Mills and Berry would fine-tune the compositions due to their greater musical experience.|$|E

Sivaji, however, is faking; he was {{informed}} of the plans to kill him by a sympathetic police constable prior to the interrogation. Left alone in the room, he electrifies himself. Sivaji's friend Dr. Chezhian, Tamizhselvi and Arivu intercept the police van after being informed by Sivaji through a MMS and replace Sivaji's body with a dummy before the thugs open fire.

It {{was supposed to be}} a sad song, but <b>everyone</b> <b>thinks</b> it's hilarious." [...] The video marks one of the early directorial efforts of Spike Jonze, whose pitch was simply [...] "A blue stage, a steadicam, a pack of wild dogs." [...] The video became an instant hit on MTV. [...] The final single, [...] "Say it Ain't So", was again inspired by Cuomo believing his parents split up when he was four because he thought his dad was an alcoholic. The music video, which was directed by Sophie Muller, was less successful than the previous Spike Jonze-directed video. It featured the band performing in the garage of their former house, and the bandmates playing hacky sack in the backyard.|$|E
50|$|Objection: Then {{why does}} <b>everyone</b> <b>think</b> that matter and an {{external}} world exist? Answer: People notice that some ideas appear {{in their minds}} independently of their wishes or desires. They then conclude that those ideas or perceived objects exist outside of the mind. This judgment, however, is a contradiction. Some philosophers, who know that ideas exist only in the mind, assume that there are external objects that resemble the ideas. They think that external objects cause internal, mental ideas.|$|R

Walt {{explains}} that he and Bob were cellmates and, prior to Walt's release, Bob drugged him and performed a transplant to switch their faces. The transplant left Walt unable to talk properly, and his garbled speech led the guards {{to put him in}} the padded cell. He wrote his message on the wall as a warning, but it was misinterpreted as a threat. Walt and the Simpsons immediately go after Bob, knowing that Bart's life is in danger.

Though he thought the wedding [...] "felt a little too rushed to leave any lingering emotional aftertaste", he praised other emotional moments in the episode and the fact that <b>everyone</b> <b>thinks</b> the Doctor is dead will help the show explore a new angle.|$|E
500|$|Earlier {{figures are}} pierced in a {{conventional}} manner, in which bent limbs separate from and rejoin the body. The later, more abstract figures are often penetrated by spaces directly through the body, by which means Moore explores and alternates concave and convex shapes. These more extreme piercings developed in parallel with Barbara Hepworth's sculptures. Hepworth first pierced a torso after misreading a review of one of Henry Moore's early shows. The [...] plaster [...] (1951) in the Tate, is characteristic of Moore's later sculptures: an abstract female figure intercut with voids. As {{with much of the}} post-War work, there are several bronze casts of this sculpture. When Moore's niece asked why his sculptures had such simple titles, he replied, [...] "All art should have a certain mystery and should make demands on the spectator. Giving a sculpture or a drawing too explicit a title takes away part of that mystery so that the spectator moves on to the next object, making no effort to ponder the meaning of what he has just seen. <b>Everyone</b> <b>thinks</b> that he or she looks but they don't really, you know." ...|$|E
