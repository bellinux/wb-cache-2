The answers are written down, then the person signs and dates his interrogation and that's the game over.|$|E
500|$|Aaron Baker in {{his book}} A Companion to Martin Scorsese {{discussed}} aspects of the theological themes in the film stating that: [...] "According {{to an analysis of}} the film by the Japanese-American theologian Fumitaka Masuoka, it pivots on the idea that the silence of God is in fact the message of God, being not the silence of nihil, or 'nothingness', but rather 'the [...] "accompaniment" [...] for the forsaken and the suffering', and the concomitant silence of Christians quietly hoping for salvation. Implicit <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> Matsuoka terms 'an element of uncertainty', a possibility that the nihil of emptiness, meaninglessness, and hopelessness will eventually prevail. Uncertainty about the fate of the soul (or the self, for secularists) {{lies at the heart of}} human experience, injecting many a mind with the existential fear, trembling, and sickness unto death of which Søren Kierkegaard vividly wrote." ...|$|E

500|$|In The New York Times, Mark Oppenheimer commented, [...] "American {{readers will}} notice {{a lack of}} enthusiasm in Peter's Christian apologetics. He {{proceeds}} largely from historical, rather than personal, evidence: here are the fruits of Christianity, and <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> one finds in its absence". In a negative review in the Winnipeg Free Press, Ted St. Godard wrote, [...] "What Hitchens can't seem to appreciate is that, even if 'Soviet Communism is organically linked to atheism, something his brother and others argue against (if somewhat feebly), and even if one accepts that Soviet tyranny was horrible, this says little {{about the existence of}} God". In a Washington Times review entitled [...] "Cain and Abel: The sequel?", Jeremy Lott wrote, [...] "Hitchens refuses to make a full-throated case for faith. He explains that 'those who choose to argue in prose... are unlikely to be receptive to a case that is most effectively couched in poetry' ... Peter does hope that Christopher might one day arrive at some sort of acceptance that belief in God is not necessarily a character fault—and that religion does not poison everything".|$|E
2500|$|Within nineteenth-century minstrelsy, {{there were}} white minstrels who used [...] "burnt cork," [...] {{but there were}} also African-American minstrels such as Henry Hart.

Detachments of the 43rd Indiana, 33rd Iowa and 33rd Missouri all seem to have been involved in the capture of the forward elements of the 37th Arkansas. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> Lieutenant-Colonel William H.

2500|$|Cabot's first voyage {{was little}} recorded. A winter 1497/98 letter from John Day (a Bristol merchant) to an {{addressee}} {{believed to be}} Christopher Columbus refers briefly to it, but writes mostly about the second, 1497 voyage. He notes, [...] "Since your Lordship wants information relating to the first voyage, <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> happened: he went with one ship, his crew confused him, he was short of supplies and ran into bad weather, {{and he decided to}} turn back." [...] Since Cabot received his royal patent in March 1496, it is believed that he made his first voyage that summer.|$|E

50|$|Traditional betas {{can be seen}} {{as those}} related to {{investments}} the common investor would already be experienced with (examples include stocks and most bonds). They are typically represented through indexation, and the techniques employed <b>here</b> <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> called “long only”. The definition of alternative beta in contrast requires the consideration of other investment techniques such as short selling, use of derivatives and leverage - techniques which are often associated with the activities of hedge funds. The underlying non-traditional investment risks are often seen as being riskier, as investors are less familiar with them.|$|R
