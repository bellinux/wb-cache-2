40|$|Telehomecare is a {{remotely}} controlled healthcare service delivered {{to a patient}} at home. The service entails automated <b>interactive</b> audio and <b>video</b> <b>equipment</b> and monitored medical devices. Enabling technologies allow the patient to hold home videoconferences, receive educational materials over the Web, upload physiological measurements, view data records from archives, respond to automated alerts and reminders, receive instructions in electronic mail concerning medication, and share experiences with other patients, in group discussions. This paper deals with guidelines of telehomecare for the underserved. Defined as patients who are urban residents {{and do not have}} adequate medical insurance, or those who live in a rural community that lacks major medical facilities and specialists. The guidelines discuss patient and provider needs, customized technologies, information exchanges, and evaluation metrics. Keywords...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that telemedicine for new patient referrals to neurological outpatients is as efficient and acceptable as conventional face to face consultation.  METHODS—A randomised controlled trial between two groups: face to face (FF) and telemedicine (TM). This study was carried out between a neurological centre and outlying clinics at two distant hospitals linked by identical medium cost commercial <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> conferencing <b>equipment</b> with ISDN lines transmitting information at 384 kbits/s. The same two neurologists carried out both arms of the study.   Of the 168 patients who were suitable for the study, 86 were randomised into the telemedicine group and 82 into the face to face group. Outcome measures were (1) consultation process: (a) number of investigations; (b) number of drugs prescribed; (c) number of patient reviews and (2) patient satisfaction: (a) confidence in consultation; (b) technical aspects of consultation; (c) aspects surrounding confidentiality. Diagnostic categories were also measured to check equivalence between the groups: these were structural neurological, structural non-neurological, non-structural, and uncertain.  RESULTS—Diagnostic categories were similar (p> 0. 5) between the two groups. Patients in the telemedicine group had significantly more investigations (p= 0. 001). There {{was no difference in}} the number of drugs prescribed (p> 0. 5). Patients were generally satisfied with both types of consultation process except for concerns about confidentiality and embarrassment in the telemedicine group (p= 0. 017 and p= 0. 005 respectively).  CONCLUSION—Telemedicine for new neurological outpatients is possible and feasible but generates more investigations and is less well accepted than face to face examination. ...|$|R
40|$|Students {{in adult}} {{literacy}} education, including basic {{and secondary education}} and English for speakers of other languages (ESOL), are increasingly using computers to write, find information, publish their writings, communicate by e-mail, learn basic skills, and for other purposes. RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES Computer hardware and software can be found to varying degrees in almost all adult literacy programs, {{and to some extent}} literacy programs also have access to the Internet, especially e-mail, electronic lists, and the World Wide Web. Nevertheless, only about a third of adult literacy programs would describe themselves as engaged in significant use of computers for any purposes, and fewer than half use computers often or daily for instruction preparation activities (Sabatini, 1997). Most programs have videocassette recorders and televisions (Turner, 1998), although, as Roberts (1993) points out, these are often underused. Some programs also have video cameras. Most programs, and many students, have audiocassette recorders. Newer kinds of technology, such as digital cameras, scanners, and CD-ROM recorders, are found less frequently. A few programs, especially those in community colleges and public schools, use two-way, <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> broadcast <b>equipment</b> for instruction and sometimes teacher training. Some students use pocket calculators, spell checkers, and other personal data assistants. In this chapter the focus is on computers, the Internet (including the World Wide Web), and, to a lesser extent, broadcast and recorded video technologies.

40|$|Teachers {{participating}} in an educational <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> program were surveyed {{each year for}} four semesters. The survey instrument contained 31 five-point Likert-type questions, with questions concerning specific comparisons between <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> and traditional teaching methods, and open-ended questions. A total of 74 teachers responded over the four-year time span. Although teachers report that <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> teaching methods require more preparation and new methods, they also report more comfort with the technology use required for <b>interactive</b> <b>video.</b> More troubling is the decreasing view of <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> as a good addition to the curriculum.

A {{majority of the}} usage of the State of Arkansas <b>Interactive</b> <b>video</b> network is educational (K- 12 and higher education). The <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> network in Arkansas allows poor rural schools to offer both core curriculum but also advance and specialized courses that otherwise would not be available. Students are able to meet or exceed the academic requirements established by the State of Arkansas via the <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> network through virtual field trips (to NASA, the Smithsonian, etc), standardized core curriculum from the Arkansas Department of Education’s Distance Learning Center (which originates educational content), and concurrent credit courses (Universities on the video network offer courses that provide the student with credits that are simultaneously recognized by the Arkansas Higher education and the Department of Education).

Interactive playability explain the capability of video puzzle game to provide enjoyment for children player, while social usability is used to explain the predictors that will improve the ease of children-computer-children interactions. In this paper, we employed interactive playability and social usability attributes in explaining <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> puzzle learning technology acceptance in preschool setting. <b>Interactive</b> <b>Video</b> Puzzle Acceptance Model had been employed to evaluate the acceptance of video puzzle technology. Results indicated that interactive playability and social usability does matter to children.

Furthermore, the children perceived that their teacher would choose the <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> puzzle learning solution on how good it was for their learning.
