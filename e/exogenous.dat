5|$|Depending on the {{organism}} and experimental system, the <b>exogenous</b> RNA {{may be a}} long strand designed to be cleaved by dicer, or short RNAs designed to serve as siRNA substrates. In most mammalian cells, shorter RNAs are used because long double-stranded RNA molecules induce the mammalian interferon response, a form of innate immunity that reacts nonspecifically to foreign genetic material. Mouse oocytes and cells from early mouse embryos lack this reaction to <b>exogenous</b> dsRNA {{and are therefore a}} common model system for studying mammalian gene-knockdown effects. Specialized laboratory techniques have also been developed to improve the utility of RNAi in mammalian systems by avoiding the direct introduction of siRNA, for example, by stable transfection with a plasmid encoding the appropriate sequence from which siRNAs can be transcribed, or by more elaborate lentiviral vector systems allowing the inducible activation or deactivation of transcription, known as conditional RNAi.|$|E
5|$|<b>Exogenous</b> dsRNA is {{detected}} and bound by an effector protein, known as RDE-4 in C. elegans and R2D2 in Drosophila, that stimulates dicer activity. This protein only binds long dsRNAs, but the mechanism producing this length specificity is unknown. This RNA-binding protein then facilitates {{the transfer of}} cleaved siRNAs to the RISC complex.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 2011, the OCA {{stripped}} Qatari Ahmed Dheeb of {{his silver}} medal in discus throw after he {{tested positive for}} <b>exogenous</b> testosterone metabolites. The bronze medalist, Iran's Mohammad Samimi was promoted as silver medalist and India's Vikas Gowda was promoted as bronze medalist.|$|E
5|$|RNAi is an RNA-dependent gene {{silencing}} {{process that is}} controlled by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and is initiated by short double-stranded RNA molecules in a cell's cytoplasm, where they interact with the catalytic RISC component argonaute. When the dsRNA is <b>exogenous</b> (coming from infection by a virus with an RNA genome or laboratory manipulations), the RNA is imported directly into the cytoplasm and cleaved to short fragments by Dicer. The initiating dsRNA can also be endogenous (originating in the cell), as in pre-microRNAs expressed from RNA-coding genes in the genome. The primary transcripts from such genes are first processed to form the characteristic stem-loop structure of pre-miRNA in the nucleus, then exported to the cytoplasm. Thus, the two dsRNA pathways, <b>exogenous</b> and endogenous, converge at the RISC.|$|E
5|$|Some {{antioxidant}} supplements may promote {{disease and}} increase mortality in humans under certain conditions. Hypothetically, free radicals induce an endogenous response that protects against <b>exogenous</b> radicals (and possibly other toxic compounds). Free radicals may increase life span. This increase may be prevented by antioxidants, providing direct evidence that toxic radicals may mitohormetically exert life extending and health promoting effects.|$|E
5|$|The ancestral {{function}} of the RNAi system is generally agreed to have been immune defense against <b>exogenous</b> genetic elements such as transposons and viral genomes. Related functions such as histone modification may have already been present in the ancestor of modern eukaryotes, although other functions such as regulation of development by miRNA {{are thought to have}} evolved later.|$|E
5|$|About 1,400 random doping {{tests were}} carried out during the Games. Two athletes tested {{positive}}; judoka Shokir Muminov on November 19, 2010 and Greco-Roman wrestler Jakhongir Muminov on November 24, 2010, both from Uzbekistan, tested positive for methylhexanamine. On January 24, 2011, the OCA announced another two doping failures, Qatari's Ahmed Dheeb who tested positive for <b>exogenous</b> testosterone metabolites and Palestinian Awajna Abdalnasser who tested positive for 19-Norandrosterone.|$|E
5|$|Credit Suisse {{developed}} the CreditRisk+ model of risk assessment in loans, which is focused {{exclusively on the}} chance of default based on the <b>exogenous</b> Poisson method. As of 2002 about 20 percent of Credit Suisse's revenue was from its insurance business it gained through the 1997 acquisition of Winterthur. The investment bank's insurance products are primarily popular in the domestic market and include auto, fire, property, life, disability, pension and retirement products among others. Historically 20â€“40 percent of the bank's revenue has been from private banking services, one of its higher profit-margin divisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{teeth and}} gums exhibit normal sensations in health. Such sensations are {{generally}} sharp, lasting {{as long as}} the stimulus. There is a continuous spectrum from physiologic sensation to pain in disease. Pain is an unpleasant sensation caused by intense or damaging events. In a toothache, nerves are stimulated by either <b>exogenous</b> sources (for instance, bacterial toxins, metabolic byproducts, chemicals, or trauma) or endogenous factors (such as inflammatory mediators).|$|E
25|$|Some {{nonlinear}} {{variants of}} models with <b>exogenous</b> variables have been defined: see for example Nonlinear autoregressive <b>exogenous</b> model.|$|E
25|$|The {{handling}} of lipoprotein {{particles in the}} body {{is referred to as}} lipoprotein particle metabolism. It is divided into two pathways, <b>exogenous</b> and endogenous, depending in large part on whether the lipoprotein particles in question are composed chiefly of dietary (<b>exogenous)</b> lipids or whether they originated in the liver (endogenous), through de novo synthesis of triacylglycerols.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the effects listed above, use of high-dose steroids {{for more than a}} week begins to produce suppression of the patient's adrenal glands because the <b>exogenous</b> glucocorticoids suppress hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone and pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone. With prolonged suppression, the adrenal glands atrophy (physically shrink), and can take months to recover full function after discontinuation of the <b>exogenous</b> glucocorticoid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Exogenous</b> ROS can be {{produced}} from pollutants, tobacco, smoke, drugs, xenobiotics, or radiation.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} {{complementarity}} between <b>exogenous</b> and endogenous variables is formally captured by single crossing differences.|$|E
25|$|A pyrogen is a {{substance}} that induces fever. These can be either internal (endogenous) or external (<b>exogenous)</b> to the body. The bacterial substance lipopolysaccharide (LPS), present in the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, {{is an example of}} an <b>exogenous</b> pyrogen. Pyrogenicity can vary: In extreme examples, some bacterial pyrogens known as superantigens can cause rapid and dangerous fevers. Depyrogenation may be achieved through filtration, distillation, chromatography, or inactivation.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, DNA can be {{introduced}} into a genome through NHEJ {{in the presence}} of <b>exogenous</b> double-stranded DNA fragments.|$|E
25|$|Kv12.2 {{channels}} {{were found}} to be inhibited by endogenous KCNE3 (and KCNE1) subunits in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Thus, silencing of endogenous KCNE3 or KCNE1 using siRNA increases the macroscopic current of exogenously expressed Kv12.2. Kv12.2 forms a tripartite complex with KCNE1 and KCNE3 in oocytes, and may do so in mouse brain. Previously, endogenous oocyte KCNE3 and KCNE1 were also found to inhibit <b>exogenous</b> hERG activity and slow the gating of <b>exogenous</b> Kv2.1.|$|E
25|$|<b>Exogenous</b> {{processes}} such as weathering, {{erosion and}} sedimentation have an important impact on modelling the land surface and creating rock formations. The <b>exogenous</b> processes have formed stone rivers in Vitosha; screes in the Balkan Mountains, Rila and Pirin; earth pyramids in Melnik, Stob and Katina; landslides, mainly along the Danube banks and the northern Black Sea coast; fluvial terraces; aeolian forms, such as dunes; karst forms, including numerous caves, sinkholes, ponors, etc.|$|E
25|$|Competence {{refers to}} a {{temporary}} state {{of being able to}} take up <b>exogenous</b> DNA from the environment; it may be induced in a laboratory.|$|E
25|$|In {{otherwise}} normal individuals, <b>exogenous</b> ligands {{can produce}} psychotic symptoms. NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, {{can produce a}} similar psychosis to that experienced in schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|Scaffold-free cartilage: Cartilage {{generated}} {{without the}} use of <b>exogenous</b> scaffold material. In this methodology, all material in the construct is cellular or material produced directly by the cells themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{settling}} {{is intended}} to clarify the wort by removing the lees from it. The lees are colloids in suspension, debris from the skins or pulp, and <b>exogenous</b> debris (soil).|$|E
25|$|Functional assays, i.e. an assay {{that tries}} to {{quantify}} functioning of an active substance rather than just its quantity. The functional counterpart of the VWF antigen assay is Ristocetin Cofactor assay, which measures the functional activity of the VWF present in a patients plasma by adding <b>exogenous</b> formalin-fixed platelets and gradually increasing quantities of drug named ristocetin while measuring agglutination of the fixed platelets. A similar assay but used for a different purpose is called Ristocetin Induced Platelet Aggregation or RIPA, which tests response of endogenous live platelets from a patient in response to Ristocetin (<b>exogenous)</b> & VWF (usually endogenous).|$|E
25|$|Most {{species of}} yeast, {{including}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, may be transformed by <b>exogenous</b> DNA in the environment. Several {{methods have been}} developed to facilitate this transformation at high frequency in the lab.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive conditions, {{including}} {{memory and}} attention dysfunctions, {{as well as}} depression, are commonly associated with elevated cortisol, and may be early indicators of <b>exogenous</b> or endogenous Cushing's. Depression and anxiety disorders are also common.|$|E
25|$|Intestinal gas is {{composed}} of varying quantities of <b>exogenous</b> sources and endogenous sources. The <b>exogenous</b> gases are swallowed (aerophagia) when eating or drinking or increased swallowing during times of excessive salivation (as might occur when nauseated or {{as the result of}} gastroesophageal reflux disease). The endogenous gases are produced either as a by-product of digesting certain types of food, or of incomplete digestion, as is the case during steatorrhea. Anything that causes food to be incompletely digested by the stomach or small intestine may cause flatulence when the material arrives in the large intestine, due to fermentation by yeast or prokaryotes normally or abnormally present in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
25|$|The {{influential}} system {{put forward}} by Kraepelin unified nearly all types of mood disorder into manicâ€“depressive insanity. Kraepelin worked from an assumption of underlying brain pathology, but also promoted a distinction between endogenous (internally caused) and <b>exogenous</b> (externally caused) types.|$|E
25|$|The {{onset of}} puberty is {{associated}} with high GnRH pulsing, which precedes the rise in sex hormones, LH and FSH. <b>Exogenous</b> GnRH pulses cause the onset of puberty. Brain tumors which increase GnRH output may also lead to premature puberty.|$|E
25|$|It {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{endogenous}} antioxidants produced by the cells, participating directly in the neutralization of free radicals and reactive oxygen compounds, as well as maintaining <b>exogenous</b> antioxidants such as vitamins C and E in their reduced (active) forms.|$|E
25|$|Mexican culture {{reflects}} {{the complexity of}} the country's history through the blending of indigenous cultures and the culture of Spain, imparted during Spain's 300-year colonization of Mexico. <b>Exogenous</b> cultural elements have been incorporated into Mexican culture as time has passed.|$|E
25|$|Induced spatial {{autocorrelation}} (or 'induced spatial dependence') {{arises from}} the species response to the spatial structure of <b>exogenous</b> (external) factors, which are themselves spatially autocorrelated. An example {{of this would be}} the winter habitat range of deer, which use conifers for heat retention and forage.|$|E
25|$|One {{model for}} the {{mechanism}} of fever caused by <b>exogenous</b> pyrogens includes LPS, which is a cell wall component of gram-negative bacteria. An immunological protein called lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) binds to LPS. The LBPâ€“LPS complex then binds to the CD14 receptor of a nearby macrophage. This binding results in the synthesis and release of various endogenous cytokine factors, such as interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha. In other words, <b>exogenous</b> factors cause release of endogenous factors, which, in turn, activate the arachidonic acid pathway. The highly toxic metabolism-boosting supplement 2,4-Dinitrophenol induces high body temperature via the inhibition of ATP production by mitochondria, resulting in impairment of cellular respiration. Instead of producing ATP, {{the energy of the}} proton gradient is lost as heat.|$|E
25|$|Most North Koreans had {{experienced}} nutritional deprivation {{long before the}} mid-1990s. The country had once been fed with a centrally planned economic system that overproduced food, had long ago reached the limits of its productive capacity, and could not respond effectively to <b>exogenous</b> shocks.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no clear}} known {{explanation}} for the accumulation of the IgA. <b>Exogenous</b> antigens for IgA have not been identified in the kidney, {{but it is possible}} that this antigen has been cleared before the disease manifests itself. It has also been proposed that IgA itself may be the antigen.|$|E
25|$|The Leydig {{cells in}} some {{species have been}} shown to possess the biosynthetic {{machinery}} to manufacture testicular oxytocin de novo, to be specific, in rats (which can synthesize vitamin C endogenously), and in guinea pigs, which, like humans, require an <b>exogenous</b> source of vitamin C (ascorbate) in their diets.|$|E
25|$|Prognosis of {{deficiency}} {{is excellent}} with treatment. Without, pellagra will gradually progress {{and lead to}} death within 4â€“5 years, often a result of malnutrition from prolonged diarrhea, or complications as caused by concurrent infections or neurological symptoms. Symptoms of pellagra can be cured with <b>exogenous</b> administration of nicotinic acid or nicotinamide.|$|E
