500|$|After the World War, {{according}} to Beldie, actor Iancovescu introduced impressions of Bogdan-Pitești to his cabaret routine. It showed the convicted Garmanophile and an unnamed German official, who {{looked into the}} mislanding of propaganda funds on supporting petty [...] "henchmen". To this charge, the fictional Bogdan-Pitești replies: [...] "I have consumed your money, this much is true, but I did not pull one on you! For {{how is it that}} you could imagine me, a traitor of my country, not also being a con artist?" [...] According to Beldie, the account has a grain of truth: instead of using money to revive the Germanophile cause, Bogdan-Pitești directed them into his art collection. A somewhat similar version of this urban legend is included in the memoirs of a National Liberal adversary, I. G. Duca, who sees Bogdan-Pitești's retort as a paradoxical sign of injured patriotism: [...] "Did you perhaps think that you might buy off some of Romania's honest people? You would be <b>dead</b> <b>wrong,</b> in this land one can only buy off the con artists, only con artists such as myself." [...] Duca concludes: [...] "this reply, with its admirable and atavistic national dignity, tempts me to forget, though not to forgive, the utter turpitude that we call Bogdan-Pitești's life." ...|$|E

40|$|Many {{people think}} that the reputations of the dead should be treated with respect, though this {{position}} is hard to defend if dead people are not only unconscious of what is said about them but also non-existent. In this paper, I examine first some unsuccessful arguments for holding that the <b>dead</b> are <b>wronged</b> by slander or denigration and ask what kind of civilised values are at issue when we speak about dead people. Subsequently I propose an alternative account which identifies the ante-mortem person as the real subject of posthumous slander. One important implication of this view is that moral status does not decline with time, so that failing to respect a dead person's good name is equally wrong whether she is long-dead or only recently deceased...|$|R

2500|$|James Jackson Kilpatrick (1920–2010) was a {{well-known}} newspaper editor in Richmond, Virginia, {{who was a}} leader in supporting segregation and {{the control of the}} South by whites only. MacLean states: [...] "The National Review made Kilpatrick its voice on {{the civil rights movement and}} the Constitution, as Buckley and Kilpatrick united North and South in a shared vision for the nation that included upholding white supremacy." [...] In the August 24, 1957, issue, Buckley's editorial [...] "Why the South Must Prevail" [...] spoke out explicitly in favor of temporary segregation in the South until [...] "long term equality could be achieved." [...] It argued that [...] "the central question that emerges... is whether the White community in the South is entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail, politically and culturally, in areas where it does not predominate numerically? The sobering answer is Yes—the White community is so entitled because, for the time being, it is the advanced race." [...] His answer was that temporary segregation in the South was a good idea now (in 1957) and the black population lacked the education, economic, or cultural development for racial equality to be possible, claiming the white South had [...] "the right to impose superior mores for whatever period it takes to effect a genuine cultural equality between the races." [...] Two weeks after that editorial was published, another prominent conservative writer, L. Brent Bozell Jr. (Buckley's brother-in-law), wrote in the National Review: “This magazine has expressed views on the racial question that I consider <b>dead</b> <b>wrong,</b> and capable of doing great hurt to the promotion of conservative causes. There is a law involved, and a Constitution, and the editorial gives White Southerners leave to violate them both in order to keep the Negro politically impotent." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{fourteen}} {{ships of}} Destroyer Squadron 11 (DESRON 11) were steaming south from San Francisco Bay to San Diego Bay on September 8, 1923. The squadron {{was led by}} Commodore Edward H. Watson, on the flagship destroyer USS Delphy. All were Clemson-class destroyers, {{less than five years}} old. The ships turned east to course 095, supposedly heading into the Santa Barbara Channel, at 21:00.The ships were navigating by dead reckoning, estimating positions from their course and speed, as measured by propeller revolutions per minute. At that time radio navigation aids were new and not completely trusted. The USS Delphy was equipped with a radio navigation receiver, but her navigator and captain ignored its indicated bearings, believing them to be erroneous. No effort was made to take soundings of water depths due to the necessity of slowing the ships down to take the measurements. The ships were performing an exercise that simulated wartime conditions, hence the decision was made not to slow down. In this case, the <b>dead</b> reckoning was <b>wrong,</b> and the mistakes were fatal. Despite the heavy fog, Commodore Watson ordered all ships to travel in close formation and, turning too soon, went aground. Six others followed and sank. Two ships whose captains disobeyed the close-formation order survived, although they also hit the rocks.|$|R
40|$|Research in the {{adaptive}} control of unknown or partially known system spans the last 25 years. Sound theories {{are being developed}} to lay a solid foundation in this field. Several approaches {{can be used to}} realize {{the adaptive}} control systems. Self-tuning regulator and model reference approaches have been used successfully in some applications. During the last decade long standing stability problems have been resolved and {{progress has been made in}} convergence theory. Major advances in microprocessor technology make it feasible to implement the adaptive control algorithms on-line. ^ Several practical systems are non-linear. The non-linearity may be due to the inherent nature of the process, saturation of the equipment, etc. Measurements also may be non-linear. Due to the inadequacy of non-linear system theory and knowledge about the process, it is many times not possible to design a suitable controller to meet the performance requirement. A logical way to approach the design is to approximate the system by a suitable linear model and represent all the non-linearities as stochastic disturbances. The self-tuning regulator utilizes linear system theory, stochastic system theory and optimal control theory. ^ Many industrial processes have dead time (transport delay) between the inputs and the outputs. Self-tuners are designed on the basis of known model order and <b>dead</b> time. <b>Wrong</b> assumptions may lead to stability problems. Further, these regulators are more sensitive to dead time than to the model order. If the dead times are varying they have to be identified on-line. A recursive procedure has been developed in this dissertation to identify the parameters and dead time simultaneously on-line. Explicit identification of the above quantities is then used to design a controller using known design procedures. As an example these procedures are applied to a chemical absorber-desorber plant. Illustrative results are presented and discussed. ^ In some instances these self-tuners may not be satisfactory due to the assumed validity of the certainty equivalent principle. Non-linear systems violate this principle. Additional control signals like probing and caution may be needed. These are discussed with reference to a simple example. Finally, general conclusions drawn from this study are presented and some areas are pointed out in which additional research is required. ...|$|R
