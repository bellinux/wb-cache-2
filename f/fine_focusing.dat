40|$|Wave {{propagation}} is a ubiquitous concept throughout physics. When {{the aim is}} {{to focus}} a wave at a given point in space or time, the resolution that can be achieved is usually limited by diffraction. However, time reversal is a method which takes advantage of multipath elements in a given channel and uses them to obtain resolution beyond the diffraction limit. This is known as super-resolution. This remarkable ability of time reversal systems to focus beyond conventional limits has found applications ranging from ultrasound, to underwater acoustics, and electromagnetics. Multipath elements of a wireless channel usually degrade the performance of such systems, but using time reversal, the multipath elements can actually lead to an advantage. When a time reversal system at RF frequencies is implemented in a waveguide, the important governing parameters that influence the effectiveness are bandwidth, number of antennas on the transmitting and receiving arrays, number of propagating modes, and reflections from terminations {{at the end of the}} waveguide. For single antennas on the transmitting and receiving ends, <b>fine</b> <b>focusing</b> resolution in space and time can be obtained if the channel is dispersive enough.

Incorporation of important CTL epitope sequences into candidate vaccines is, therefore, vital. Most CTL studies have focused upon small numbers of adult Caucasoid subjects infected with clade-B virus, whereas the global epidemic is most severe in sub-Saharan African populations and predominantly involves clade-C infection in both adults and children. In this study, sensitive enzyme-linked immunospot (elispot) assays have been utilized to identify the dominant Gag-specific CTL epitopes targeted by adults and children infected with clade-B or -C virus. Cohorts evaluated included 44 B-clade-infected Caucasoid American and African American adults and children and 37 C-clade-infected African adults and children from Durban, South Africa. The results show that 3 out of 46 peptides spanning p 17 (Gag) and p 24 (Gag) sequences tested contain two-thirds of the dominant Gag-specific epitopes, irrespective of the clade, ethnicity, or age group studied. However, there were distinctive differences between the dominant responses made by Caucasoids and Africans. Dominant responses in Caucasoids were more often within p 17 (Gag) peptide residues 16 to 30 (38 versus 12 %; P 30 % of the total infected population in Durban. This epitope is closely homologous with dominant HIV- 2 and simian immunodeficiency virus Gag-specific CTL epitopes.

40|$|Introduction: Whole slide imaging (WSI) permits {{intraoperative}} consultations (frozen sections) to {{be performed}} remotely. However, WSI files are large and can be problematic if there are tissue artifacts (e. g., tissue folds) or when slides are scanned without multiplanes (Z-stacks) to permit focusing. The Panoptiq dynamic imaging system allows users {{to create their own}} digital files that combine low power panoramic digital images with regions of interest that can be imaged using high power Z-stacks. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the utility of the Panoptiq dynamic imaging system for frozen section telepathology. Materials and Methods: Twenty archival randomly selected genitourinary surgical pathology frozen sectional cases were evaluated using conventional light microscopy (glass slides), panoramic images, and whole slide images. To create panoramic images glass slides were digitized using a Prosilica GT camera (model GT 1920 C, Allied Vision Technologies) attached to an Olympus B × 45 microscope and Dell Precision Tower 810 computer (Dell). Panoptiq 3 version 3. 1. 2 software was used for image acquisition and Panoptiq View version 3. 1. 2 to view images (ViewsIQ, Richmond, BC, Canada). Image acquisition using Panoptiq software involved a pathology resident, who manually created digital maps (× 4 objective) and then selected representative regions of interest to generate Z-stacks at higher magnification (× 40 objective). Whole slide images were generated using an Aperio XT Scanscope (Leica) and viewed using ImageScope Software (Aperio ePathology, Leica). Three pathologists were asked to render diagnoses and rate image quality (1 - 10) and their diagnostic confidence (1 - 10) for each modality. Results: The diagnostic concordance with glass slides was 98. 3 % for panoramic images and 100 % for WSI. Panoptiq images were comparable to the glass slide viewing experience in terms of image quality and diagnostic confidence. Complaints regarding WSI included poor focus near tissue folds and air bubbles. Panoptiq permitted <b>fine</b> <b>focusing</b> of tissue folds and air bubbles. Issues with panoramic images included difficulty interpreting low-resolution × 4 image maps and the presence of tiling artifacts. In some cases, Z-stacked areas of Panoptiq images were limited or not representative of diagnostic regions. The image file size of Panoptiq was more than 14 times smaller than that of WSI files. Conclusions: The Panoptiq imaging system is a novel tool that can be used for frozen section telepathology. Panoramic digital images were easy to generate and navigate, of relatively small file size, and offered a mechanism to overcome focusing problems commonly encountered with WSI of frozen sections. However, the acquisition of representative Panoptiq images was operator dependent with the individual creating files that may impact the final diagnosis...|$|E

The evaluation of "Z-axis" bias and the "Z-axis" calibration were made utilizing a cover slip and a "manual digimatic outside micrometer scale" (Mitutoyo, Japan). Calibrating the cover slip we performed the calibration of the "Z-axis" of a microscope. In the cover slip two lines were painted with different colors using a pen glass. A blue line was painted on the up surface and another line (red) on the bottom surface of the cover slip forming a cross. Two metal rings with one palette welded in each were adapted in the microscope. Other palette was welded in the gross focuses in order to restrict {{the route of the}} <b>fine</b> <b>focuses</b> (Z-axis study) using the two palettes fixed in both rings.
