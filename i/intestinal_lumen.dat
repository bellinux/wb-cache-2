25|$|Complications {{of ovarian}} cancer can include spread of the cancer to other organs, {{progressive}} function loss of various organs, ascites, and intestinal obstructions, which can be fatal. Intestinal obstructions in multiple sites {{are the most common}} proximate cause of death. Intestinal obstruction in ovarian cancer can either be a true obstruction, where tumor blocks the <b>intestinal</b> <b>lumen,</b> or a pseudo-obstruction, when tumor prevents normal peristalsis. Continuous accumulation of ascites can be treated by placing a drain that can be self-drained.|$|E
25|$|Atorvastatin is {{primarily}} eliminated via hepatic biliary excretion, {{with less than}} 2% recovered in the urine. Bile elimination follows hepatic and/or extrahepatic metabolism. There {{does not appear to}} be any entero-hepatic recirculation. Atorvastatin has an approximate elimination half-life of 14 h. Noteworthy, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity appears to have a half-life of 20–30 h, which is thought to be due to the active metabolites. Atorvastatin is also a substrate of the intestinal P-glycoprotein efflux transporter, which pumps the drug back into the <b>intestinal</b> <b>lumen</b> during drug absorption.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Groups of {{gnotobiotic}} piglets were orally inoculated at 3 days of {{age with}} either Helicobacter heilmannii (Hh) or a newly described porcine-origin gastric Helicobacter pylori (Hp) -like bacterium. Three Hh-infected and 6 porcine Hp-like–infected swine were fed a milk replacement diet containing 5 – 10 % (v/v) sterile corn syrup as a dietary source of fermentable carbohydrate. None of the piglets infected with Hh and supplemented with corn syrup developed gastric mucosal ulcers; 2 developed small erosive lesions in the pars esophagea. In contrast, all 6 dietary carbohydrate-supplemented Hp-like–infected swine developed severe gastroesophageal ulcers; 1 of these ex-sanguinated into {{the stomach and}} died {{before the end of}} the experiment. Four of these 6 piglets had grossly evident partially digested blood in the <b>intestinal</b> <b>lumens,</b> indicative of bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract from the stomach.

25|$|The {{intestine}} becomes distended due to {{the trapped}} fluid and gas production from bacteria. It is this distension, and subsequent activation of stretch receptors within the intestinal wall, {{that leads to the}} associated pain. With progressive distension of the intestinal wall, there is occlusion of blood vessels, firstly the less rigid veins, then arteries. This impairment of blood supply leads to hyperemia and congestion, and ultimately to ischaemic necrosis and cellular death. The poor blood supply also has effects on the vascular endothelium, leading to an increased permeability which first leaks plasma and eventually blood into the <b>intestinal</b> <b>lumen.</b> In the opposite fashion, gram-negative bacteria and endotoxins can enter the bloodstream, leading to further systemic effects.|$|E
25|$|During the naupliar stage, the copepod host ingests the {{unicellular}} dinospore of the parasite.

25|$|Fluids are {{commonly}} given, either orally by nasogastric tube or by intravenous catheter, to restore proper hydration and electrolyte balance. In cases of strangulating obstruction or enteritis, the intestine will have decreased absorption and increased secretion of fluid into the <b>intestinal</b> <b>lumen,</b> making oral fluids ineffective and possibly dangerous if they cause gastric distention and rupture. This process of secretion into the <b>intestinal</b> <b>lumen</b> leads to dehydration, and these horse require {{large amounts of}} IV fluids to prevent hypotension and subsequent cardiovascular collapse. Fluid rates are calculated by adding the fluid lost during each collection of gastric reflux to the daily maintenance requirement of the horse. Due {{to the fact that}} horses absorb water in the cecum and colon, the IV fluid requirement of horses with simple obstruction is dependent on the location of the obstruction. Those that are obstructed further distally, such as at the pelvic flexure, are able to absorb more oral fluid than those obstructed in the small intestine, and therefore require less IV fluid support. Impactions are usually managed with fluids for 3–5 days before surgery is considered. Fluids are given based on results of the physical examination, such as mucous membrane quality, PCV, and electrolyte levels. Horses in circulatory shock, such as those suffering from endotoxemia, require very high rates of IV fluid administration. Oral fluids via nasogastric tube are often given in the case of impactions to help lubricate the obstruction. Oral fluids should not be given if significant amounts of nasogastric reflux are obtained. Access to food and water will often be denied to allow careful monitoring and administration of what is taken in by the horse.|$|E
40|$|Association of {{specific}} antimicrobial resistance patterns with unrelated selective traits {{has long been}} implicated in the maintenance of antimicrobial resistance in a population. Previously we demonstrated that Escherichia coli strains with a specific resistance pattern (resistant to streptomycin, sulfadiazine, and tetracycline [SSuT]) have a selective advantage in dairy calf intestinal environments and {{in the presence of}} a milk supplement commonly fed to the calves. In the present study we identified the sequence of the genetic element that confers the SSuT phenotype and show that this element is present in a genetically diverse group of E. coli isolates, as assessed by macrorestriction digestion and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. This element was also found in E. coli isolates from 18 different cattle farms in Washington State. Using in vitro competition experiments we further demonstrated that SSuT strains from 17 of 18 farms were able to outcompete pansusceptible strains. In a separate set of experiments, we were able to transfer the antimicrobial resistance phenotype by electroporation to a laboratory strain of E. coli (DH 10 B), making that new strain more competitive during in vitro competition with the parental DH 10 B strain. These data indicate that a relatively large genetic element conferring the SSuT phenotype is widely distributed in E. coli from cattle in Washington State. Furthermore, our results indicate that this element is responsible for maintenance of these traits owing to linkage to genetic traits that confer a selective advantage in the <b>intestinal</b> <b>lumens</b> of dairy calves...|$|R

25|$|Water {{absorption}} at {{the colon}} typically proceeds against a transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient. The standing gradient osmosis is the reabsorption of water against the osmotic gradient in the intestines. Cells occupying the intestinal lining pump sodium ions into the intercellular space, raising the osmolarity of the intercellular fluid. This hypertonic fluid creates an osmotic pressure that drives {{water into the}} lateral intercellular spaces by osmosis via tight junctions and adjacent cells, which then in turn moves across the basement membrane and into the capillaries, while more sodium ions are pumped again into the intercellular fluid. Although water travels down an osmotic gradient in each individual step, overall, water usually travels against the osmotic gradient due to the pumping of sodium ions into the intercellular fluid. This allows the large intestine to absorb water despite the blood in capillaries being hypotonic compared to the fluid within the <b>intestinal</b> <b>lumen.</b>|$|E

[...] The different hydrolyzing enzymes are activated by different types of bile salts and have distinct substrate specificities. [...] For example, whereas the pancreatic estrase is selective for short-chain retinyl esters, the brush-border membrane enzyme preferentially hydrolyzes retinyl esters containing a long-chain fatty acid such as palmitate or stearate.

The objective {{of this study was to}} develop an in vitro model to study the passage of Stx across intact, polarized cell monolayers. Translocation of biologically active Stx was examined in four cell lines grown on polycarbonate filters. Stx 1 translocated across intestinal cell monolayers (CaCo 2 A and T 84 cells) in an energy-requiring and saturable manner, while the monolayers maintained a high level of electrical resistance. Stx 1 had no effect on electrical resistance or inulin movement across these cell lines for at least 24 h. Induction of specific Stx receptors with sodium butyrate reduced the proportion of toxin translocated across CaCo 2 A monolayers but had no major effect on the movement of horseradish peroxidase or [3 H]inulin. We have shown that biologically active Stx 1 is capable of moving across intact polarized intestinal epithelial cells without apparent cellular disruption, probably via a transcellular pathway. The data also suggest that the presence of Stx receptors on the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells may offer some protection against the absorption of luminal Stx 1.

40|$|Complete {{occlusion}} of {{the portal}} vein for 2 hours has been studied, in the calf, {{in an attempt}} to produce survival with appropriate resuscitation. Systemic blood pressure fell immediately on occlusion and the portal blood became markedly acidotic with a rise in packed cell volume and plasma potassium. Circulating blood volume decreased by 50 per cent despite major transfusion. When the occlusion was released, blood pressure returned to normal levels for several hours. However a hemorrhagic enteropathy developed in the small intestine. Large quantities of serosanguineous fluid collected in the <b>intestinal</b> wall and <b>lumen</b> and in the peritoneal cavity. Marked hemo-concentration developed and the animal did not respond to further resuscitation. All animals grew E. coli on portal blood culture after occlusion.

Administration of metoclopramide significantly reduced the time taken for delivery of 50 % and 80 % of the meal to the ileal aspiration site, but had no significant effect on the half time for gastric emptying. Administration of metoclopramide did not affect the average flow rate or the total postprandial volume, which passed the ileal aspiration site. Administration of metoclopramide reduced carbohydrate absorption in every subject by between 8 and 30 %. This study is consistent with the hypothesis that metoclopramide may reduce the degree of absorption in the human small intestine by decreasing the contact time between food and small intestinal epithelium, though it could also act by reducing the area of mucosa in contact with nutrients...|$|R

40|$|Paneth {{cells are}} {{specialized}} small intestine epithelial cells that contain lysozyme, possess phagocytic properties, and secrete cytoplasmic granules into the <b>intestinal</b> crypt <b>lumen</b> after {{the entry of}} bacteria.

We purified two closely related defensins, cryptdin 1 and cryptdin 2, from a subcellular fraction of murine small intestine cells that was enriched in Paneth cells. Both peptides contained 35 amino acid residues, including the characteristic defensin "signature" of six invariantly conserved cysteines. Cryptdins 1 and 2 were approximately 90 to 95 % homologous {{to each other and}} to the carboxy-terminal domain of the 93 -amino-acid defensin precursor, cryptdin A, described by Ouellette and associates (Ouellette et al., J. Cell Biol. 108 : 1687 - 1695, 1989). Both cryptdins exerted bactericidal activity against Listeria monocytogenes EGD and Escherichia coli ML- 35 p in vitro. Their potency exceeded that of human neutrophil defensin HNP- 1 but was considerably lower than that of NP- 1, a defensin produced by rabbit neutrophils and alveolar macrophages. Both cryptdins killed mouse-avirulent Salmonella typhimurium 7953 S (phoP) much more effectively than its phoP+, mouse-virulent, isogenic counterpart, S. typhimurium 14028 S. Our data indicate that mouse intestinal prodefensins are processed into 35 -amino-acid mature defensins (cryptdins) with broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties.

40|$|One of {{the early}} events in {{physiological}} shock is the generation of activators for leukocytes, endothelial cells, and other cells in the cardiovascular system. The mechanism by which these activators are produced has remained unresolved. We examine here the hypothesis that pancreatic digestive enzymes in the ischemic intestine {{may be involved in}} the generation of activators during <b>intestinal</b> ischemia.

This procedure inhibited activation of circulating leukocytes during occlusion and reperfusion. It also prevented the appearance of activators in portal venous and systemic artery plasma and attenuated initiating symptoms of multiple organ injury in shock. Intestinal tissue produces only low levels of activators in the absence of pancreatic enzymes, whereas in the presence of enzymes, activators are produced in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion. The results indicate that pancreatic digestive enzymes in the ischemic intestine serve as an important source for cell activation and inflammation, as well as multiple organ failure...|$|R
40|$|Animals can {{determine}} the nutritional value of sugar without the influence of taste. Here, we describe a Drosophila mutant that is insensitive to the nutritional value of sugars, but responds only to the concentration (i. e. sweetness). The affected gene encodes a sodium/solute cotransporter-like protein, designated dSLC 5 A 11 (or cupcake), which is structurally similar to mammalian sodium/glucose cotransporters (SGLTs) that transport sugar across the <b>intestinal</b> and renal <b>lumen.</b> However, dSLC 5 A 11 is prominently expressed in 10 - 13 pairs of R 4 neurons of the ellipsoid body (EB) {{in the brain and}} functions in these neurons for selecting appropriate foods.

Claudin- 7 expression is increased as epithelial cells differentiate along the intestinal crypt-luminal axis. By using model IECs we observed increased claudin- 7 mRNA and nascent heteronuclear RNA levels during differentiation. A screen for potential regulators of the CLDN 7 gene during IEC differentiation was performed using a transcription factor/DNA binding array, CLDN 7 luciferase reporters, and in silico promoter analysis.

Loperamide treatment caused marked decreases in fecal pellet numbers and water content discharged, {{as well as in}} the surface mucosal thickness of the colonic <b>lumen,</b> <b>intestinal</b> charcoal transit ratio, thickness, and number of mucous-producing goblet cells in the colonic mucosa, whereas it increased the remnant fecal pellet number and the mean diameter of the colonic lumen.

FRe (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg) was administered orally once per day for six days following 1 h loperamide treatment. The laxative effects of FRe were compared with those of sodium picosulfate (S. picosulfate). Following the induction of constipation in the rats, a marked decrease was observed in the fecal pellet number and water content discharged over 24 h, the surface mucus thickness in the colonic <b>lumen,</b> <b>intestinal</b> charcoal transit ratio, thickness of the colonic mucosa and the number of mucus-producing cells, while an increase was observed in the number of fecal pellets remaining in the colonic lumen and their mean diameter, as compared with the normal vehicle control rats.

However, the alleviating effects were lower than those of S. picosulfate, with the exception of the intestinal charcoal transit ratio. Similar effects on the intestinal charcoal transit ratio were detected for the three doses of FRe when compared with the S. picosulfate-treated rats.

40|$|The {{intestinal}} {{immune system}} is crucial {{for the maintenance of}} mucosal homeostasis and has evolved under the dual pressure of protecting the host from pathogenic infection and coexisting with the dense and diverse commensal organisms in the <b>lumen.</b> <b>Intestinal</b> intraepithelial lymphocytes (iIELs) are the first element of the host T cell compartment available to respond to oral infection by pathogens. This study demonstrated that oral infection by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium promoted the expansion of iIELs, particularly CD 8 TCR IELs, enhanced expression of NKG 2 D on iIELs, increased expression of MULT 1, and decreased expression of Qa- 1 by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), leading to activation of, particularly, CD 8 TCR iIELs and cytolytic activity against S.

40|$|Tachykinin NK 2 receptors are {{expressed}} in the gastrointestinal tract of both laboratory animals and humans. Experimental data indicate a role for these receptors in the regulation of intestinal motor functions (both excitatory and inhibitory), secretions, inflammation and visceral sensitivity. In particular, NK 2 receptor stimulation inhibits intestinal motility by activating sympathetic extrinsic pathways or NANC intramural inhibitory components, whereas a modulatory effect on cholinergic nerves or a direct effect on smooth muscle account for the NK 2 receptor-mediated increase in intestinal motility. Accordingly, selective NK 2 receptor antagonists can reactivate inhibited motility or decrease inflammation- or stress-associated hypermotility. Intraluminal secretion of water is increased by NK 2 receptor agonists via a direct effect on epithelial cells, and this mechanism is active in models of diarrhoea since selective antagonists reverse the increase in faecal water content in these models. Hyperalgesia in response to intraluminal volume signals is possibly mediated through the stimulation of NK 2 receptors located on peripheral branches of primary afferent neurones. NK 2 receptor antagonists reduce the hyper-responsiveness that occurs following intestinal inflammation or application of stressful stimuli to animals. Likewise, NK 2 receptor antagonists reduce intestinal tissue damage induced by chemical irritation of the <b>intestinal</b> wall or <b>lumen.</b> In healthy volunteers, the selective NK 2 antagonist nepadutant reduced the motility-stimulating effects and irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms triggered by intravenous infusion of neurokinin A, and displayed other characteristics that could support its use in patients.
