A 2006 publication goes further, describing him as [...] "the first American casualty of South Pacific combat".|$|E

2500|$|The word [...] "chastity" [...] is {{employed}} in two ways. First, properly; {{and thus it}} is a special virtue having a special matter, namely the concupiscences relating to venereal pleasures. Secondly, the word [...] "chastity" [...] {{is employed}} metaphorically: for just as a mingling of bodies conduces to venereal pleasure which is the proper matter of chastity and of lust its contrary vice, so too the spiritual union of the mind with certain things conduces to a pleasure which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> a spiritual chastity metaphorically speaking, {{as well as of}} a spiritual fornication likewise metaphorically so called. For if the human mind delight in the spiritual union with that to which it behooves it to be united, namely God, and refrains from delighting in union with other things against the requirements of the order established by God, this may be called a spiritual chastity, according to 2 Cor. 11:2, [...] "I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ." [...] If, on the other hand, the mind be united to any other things whatsoever, against the prescription of the Divine order, it will be called spiritual fornication, according to Jer. 3:1, [...] "But thou hast prostituted thyself to many lovers." [...] Taking chastity in this sense, it is a general virtue, because every virtue withdraws the human mind from delighting in a union with unlawful things. Nevertheless, the essence of this chastity consists principally in charity and the other theological virtues, whereby the human mind is united to God.|$|E
2500|$|The PCA {{has little}} doctrinal quarrel with the OPC. [...] Both {{denominations}} have similar {{views on the}} Federal Vision, creation and justification. [...] While most OPC congregations allow women only to teach children and other women in Sunday school, some moderate PCA congregations allow women to do anything a non-ordained man can do. While the OPC and the PCA both adhere to the Westminster Standards, the OPC is generally more strict in requiring its officers to subscribe to those standards without exception. It {{is hard to find}} any doctrinal differences between these two denominations. In recent years the OPC and PCA published substantial similar reports on the Creation Days, the debate about Justification and the issue of the Federal Vision. [...] They have identical positions on social issues like women in combat, Freemasonry and abortion. The only divergence of any significance <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> charismatic gifts. The OPC maintains a strict cessationist position, while the PCA allows presbyteries to ordain non-cessationists if they do not believe that ongoing gifts are relevatory and they promise not to teach their distinctive views, but most PCA presbyteries would refuse to ordain such a man. Many PCA churches have moved toward contemporary worship, while the OPC is dominated by traditional Reformed worship. [...] The southern roots of the Presbyterian Church in America were tempered somewhat by the merger with the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod and the northern roots of the OPC was also tempered by the influence of Van Til and Kuyper. Nonetheless, the two denominations enjoy fraternal relations and cooperate in a number of ways, such as sharing control of a publication company, Great Commission Publications, which produces Sunday School curricula for both denominations.|$|E
2500|$|... {{literally}} pleasure marriage) is a fixed-term or short-term contractual {{marriage in}} Shia Islam. The duration {{of this type}} of marriage is fixed at its inception and is then automatically dissolved upon completion of its term. For this reason, nikah mut‘ah has been widely criticised as the religious cover and legalization of prostitution. The Christian missionary Thomas Patrick Hughes criticized Mut'ah as allowing the continuation of [...] "one of the abominable practices of ancient Arabia." [...] Shi'a and Sunnis agree that Mut'ah was legal in early times, but Sunnis consider that it was abrogated. Ibn Kathir writes that [...] "here's no doubt that in the outset of Islam, Mut'ah was allowed under the Shari'ah". Currently, however, mut'ah is one of the distinctive features of Ja'fari jurisprudence. No other school of Islamic jurisprudence allows it. According to Imam Jafar as Sadiq, [...] "One of the matters about which I shall never keep precautionary silence (taqiyya) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> mu’tah." [...] Allameh Tabatabaei defends the Shia view in Tafsir al-Mizan, arguing that there are mutawatir or nearly mutawatir traditions narrated from the Shia Imams that Mut'ah is permitted. For example, it has been narrated from Muhammad al-Baqir and Ja'far al-Sadiq that they said [...] "regarding the [...] verse, and there is no blame on you about what you mutually agree after what is appointed." [...] It means that he increases her dowry or she increases his (fixed) period. Sunnis believe that Muhammad later abolished this type of marriage at several different large events, the most accepted being at Khaybar in 7 AH (629 CE) [...] and at the Victory of Mecca in 8 AH (630 CE). Most Sunnis believe that Umar later was merely enforcing a prohibition that was established during Muhammad's time. Shia contest the criticism that nikah mut‘ah is a cover for prostitution, and argue that the unique legal nature of temporary marriage distinguishes Mut'ah ideologically from prostitution.|$|E
