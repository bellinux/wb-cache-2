25|$|In {{the winter}} of 2015 Hampshire {{completed}} the signing of England seamer Reece Topley from Essex. The club also announced that Fidel Edwards had signed a new deal and South African all rounder Ryan McLaren had signed as an overseas player. On 14 January 2016, Hampshire Cricket was announced as one of six new teams in the inaugural Women's Cricket Super League. Hampshire, in partnership with Berkshire, Dorset, Isle of Wight, Oxfordshire, Sussex and Wiltshire cricket boards along with Southampton Solent University, will compete in a women's Twenty20 competition against the other team. On 28 January 2016 Hampshire appointed former Wiltshire coach Nick Denning as their inaugural coach for their Women's team. Following the appointment of Denning, Hampshire announced the naming of their Women's Cricket Super League team as the Southern Vipers. The Vipers then won the inaugural Kia Super League on 21 August, defeating Western Force in the final by 7 wickets. Overseas star Suzie Bates was named as player of the tournament. For the male team {{though it was a}} season of disappointment. A large number of injuries {{at the start of the}} season, including to fast bowlers Reece Topley, Fidel Edwards, Chris Wood and Ryan Stevenson, coupled with poor form and tough circumstances, after the death of trialist fast bowler Hamza Ali in a drowning accident, and long serving opening batsman Michael Carberry being diagnosed with a cancerous lung tumour, saw Hampshire suffer a poor season, being knocked out in the group stages of both the Natwest t20 Blast, where they missed out on Finals Day for the first time since 2009, and the Royal London One-Day Cup. Their championship season was much the same as in 2015, again making a slow start, but they gave themselves too much to do and were relegated back to Division Two after defeat against Durham on 23 September 2016. However, on 3 October 2016 Hampshire were given a reprieve as Durham were relegated to Division Two after taking up a <b>financial</b> <b>package</b> from the ECB to help with their finances, with their relegation and a points deduction being the fine for taking this agreement. Coach Dale Benkenstein departed as coach for 'Personal Reasons' in mid-July and was replaced by Craig White originally in a caretaker role, before taking over as full-time first team coach in November. At the end of the season, long serving seamer James Tomlinson retired having been with Hampshire since 2002 and making over 150 appearances in all formats for Hampshire. The Winter of 2017 saw Hampshire draw criticism over the signings of Kyle Abbott and Rilee Rossouw on Kolpak deals, with these players giving up international cricket to represent Hampshire. On the field Hampshire again had a mixed season in first class cricket, avoiding relegation for the 3rd season in a row by drawing against already relegated Warwickshire meaning relegation for Middlesex, with Kolpak Abbott taking 60 wickets across the First-class season. In List A cricket Hampshire again missed out on the knockout stages. However Hampshire performed better in Twenty20 cricket, qualifying for their 7th Finals Day in 8 years, although they lost in the Semi-final to eventual winners Nottinghamshire. They also recorded their highest Twenty20 score in their Quarter final victory over Derbyshire scoring 249-8, with Pakistan overseas player Shahid Afridi scoring a century.|$|E
500|$|Roy Scheider reluctantly {{returned}} to reprise {{his role as}} Martin Brody. In 1977, he had quit the role of Michael Vronsky in The Deer Hunter {{two weeks before the}} start of filming because of [...] "creative differences". Scheider was contracted to Universal at the time for a three-picture deal, but the studio offered to forgive his failure to fulfill his contractual obligation if he agreed to appear in Jaws 2. The actor heavily resisted the film, claiming that there was nothing new to create and that people would be watching the film to see the shark, not him. According to his biographer, Scheider was so desperate to be relieved from the role that he [...] "pleaded insanity and went crazy in The Beverly Hills Hotel". However, he was given an attractive <b>financial</b> <b>package</b> for appearing in Jaws 2; he quadrupled his base salary from the first film, and negotiated points (a percentage of the film's net profits). The Star newspaper reported that Scheider received $500,000 for 12 weeks work, plus $35,000 for each additional week that the schedule ran over.|$|E

2500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 7 December, the FSAI claimed identification of the source as a contaminated ingredient which had been added to pork feed, {{and said it was}} now considered that the profile of dioxins located is similar to those found in electronic transformer oils. On the evening of that same day, RTÉ, the state-run broadcaster, reported that the source of the crisis was a processing plant in County Carlow (see Millstream Power Recycling Limited). A garda investigation was launched. The Association of Pigmeat Processors refused to continue slaughtering pigs, insisting they needed a massive <b>financial</b> <b>package</b> (up to €1 billion) from the Irish government to assist them with the mass recall. The European Union maintained {{that there would be no}} funding for the Irish pork industry in the wake of the crisis. Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny criticised the Irish government, calling the crisis [...] "an unmitigated disaster".|$|E
2500|$|Sheedy {{spent much}} of his first two years in office as his {{predecessors}} did—fighting large layoffs of state workers. [...] Governor George Pataki vetoed legislation improving pensions, threatened to shut down state government and furlough all non-essential workers if the legislature didn't approve his budget, attempted to close state-run health care facilities, and cut more than 5,500 state jobs. In this difficult negotiating climate, Sheedy re-negotiated PEF's expiring contract in April 1995. [...] He agreed to the same <b>financial</b> <b>package</b> won by CSEA a month earlier: A four-year contract with a 3.5 percent salary increase in 1997 and 1998, and one-time bonuses in 1996 and 1997; a change in civil service definitions which would permit PEF workers to transfer more easily to other jobs and retain their salary levels; and no expiration date for the union's benefit packages. Additional job cuts occurred in 1996 and 1997, totalling 20,000 state workers. The state offered early retirement again to many employees. When the state pension fund showed a surplus, Sheedy found himself caught between two opposing factions of PEF members: Use the funds to lower pension contribution costs from current members, or give the surplus to retiree members as a cost-of-living increase.|$|E

2500|$|On November 6, 2003, Mayor Williams {{announced}} that the project had been awarded to the Hines Interests/Archstone/The Georgetown Co. group. The Hines group was chosen because of its track record, its proposal, and because it also {{had a history of}} working with minority-owned businesses. The group's <b>financial</b> <b>package</b> was also superior. The city had been willing to use up to $20 million annually in tax revenues generated by the project to help finance construction. But the Hines-led group was able to secure financing without city assistance, a much more favorable financial deal for the District of Columbia. (In a separate report, however, The Bond Buyer reported that it was yet unclear whether the project would require city financial backing, and that individual projects within the development might use city-issued tax-exempt bonds for funding.) The development group also said it would make a cash payment to the city immediately upon approval of the deal and give the city a portion of the profits from the project, a combined income which city officials said was worth $250 million. The winning proposal included [...] of ground level retail space; 600 apartments and 275 condominiums; [...] of office space; a 200 to 300 room boutique hotel; and a [...] "cultural facility" [...] (whose use was not yet determined) that included a 3,000-seat theater. (At least one report gave the size of the cultural facility as just [...]) Each of the buildings in the project was 11 stories high, and construction was anticipated to begin in late 2005. Hines executives said construction of the project would indirectly contribute $350 million to the local economy, and when complete the development would generate $15 to $20 million a year in property tax revenues for the city.|$|E
2500|$|Lang {{was born}} in 1870 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. During his childhood, Lang was a well known Pittsburgh Pirates fan and {{associated}} with the players {{before and after the}} games even though he was of school age. Ignoring parental reprimands, Lang often attended games with his boyhood friend, Barney Dreyfuss [...] As a young adult, Lang established a laundry business that became the largest in city. At the time, Pittsburgh was a city that had an economy focused on steel and smelting businesses and was known for its poor air quality. In 1910, at the age of 39, Lang suffered from respiratory ailments and was told by his doctors that his condition was terminal if he stayed in Pittsburgh. Subsequently, Lang sold his laundry business and moved to St. Petersburg. As a result of the move, Lang’s health improved and he began to extol the virtues of his new home town. At the same time, Dreyfuss had become a successful baseball executive and in 1913 bought the Pirates. Lang traveled back to Pittsburgh and asked Dreyfuss to consider moving the Pirates to St. Petersburg for spring training, but Dreyfuss was already using Hot Springs, Arkansas, for spring training {{and did not want to}} move his team. Dreyfuss also saw no value in traveling to such a small town unfamiliar to most. Convinced that St. Petersburg would make a good spring training site, Lang eventually convinced the St. Louis Browns to make St. Petersburg their spring training home for the 1914 baseball season. Branch Rickey, the Browns' parsimonious general manager, was attracted to the city’s <b>financial</b> <b>package</b> that included payment for the team’s travel expenses. The following year, Lang convinced the Philadelphia Phillies to make the same move.|$|E
