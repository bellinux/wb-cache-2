5|$|Japanese lacquerwork {{reached its}} apogee in the 17th century Edo period when lacquer {{was used for}} {{decorative}} objects as well as everyday items such as combs, tables, bottle, <b>headrests,</b> small boxes or writing cases. The most famous artist of this time was the lacquerer painter Ogata Kōrin. He {{was the first to}} use mother of pearl and pewter in larger quantities for decorating lacquerware.|$|E
5|$|The spells of the Book of the Dead {{made use}} of several magical {{techniques}} which {{can also be seen}} in other areas of Egyptian life. A number of spells are for magical amulets, which would protect the deceased from harm. In addition to being represented on a Book of the Dead papyrus, these spells appeared on amulets wound into the wrappings of a mummy. Everyday magic {{made use of}} amulets in huge numbers. Other items in direct contact with the body in the tomb, such as <b>headrests,</b> were also considered to have amuletic value. A number of spells also refer to Egyptian beliefs about the magical healing power of saliva.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} LS with {{continuous}} controlled Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). The addition of an automated parallel parking assist feature, {{the first of its}} kind in the U.S., allowed the LS 460 to steer itself into preselected parking spaces. Other drive-assist features included a brake-hold system, radar cruise control, electric variable gear ratio power steering, and electronically controlled braking. The new stability control system was improved to anticipate skids and alter steering assist and gear ratios. The suite of new safety features extended from an eye-tracking Driver Monitoring System to a lane departure warning system. The pre-collision system added the first production image processing chip in a car capable of identifying vehicles and pedestrians in real time, along with millimeter-wavelength radar, stereo cameras, and infrared night vision projectors. A rear pre-collision system with whiplash-preventing active seat <b>headrests</b> and dual-chamber front airbags was also introduced.|$|E
40|$|The {{automotive}} seat <b>headrest</b> {{plays an}} important role in the passenger protection during car crashes, and its structure parameters and performance have direct influence on the seat crashworthiness. In this paper, according to relevant regulations of GB 11550 - 2009, collision simulation analyses of the seat <b>headrest</b> structure were carried out by Ls-dyna code. The law of different <b>headrest</b> packaging parameters on collision energy absorption was investigated to provide guidance for the <b>headrest</b> structure optimization design and improvement. The research results show that, with the increase of packaging of the <b>headrest,</b> the maximum acceleration and high acceleration duration time of head gradually decreases...|$|R
40|$|Wheelchair {{transportation}} safety research has primarily addressed frontal impact consequences. This {{study is a}} first, examining effects of <b>headrest</b> use on pediatric injury measures under rear impact conditions. Two sets of three identical WC 19 transit-option manual pediatric wheelchairs were tested: three sled tests were conducted without a <b>headrest</b> and three with a <b>headrest.</b> All tests used a 26 km/h, 10 g rear impact test pulse, seated Hybrid III 6 -year old anthropomorphic test device (ATD), and 4 -point strap-type surrogate wheelchair tiedowns and 3 -point occupant restraints (WTORS). Results suggest a lower risk of head and neck injury with wheelchair <b>headrest</b> use...|$|R

25|$|At mid-year a sunroof option became {{available}} on two-door models. Also, the optional Strato bucket seats available on coupes switched {{from the previous}} low-back design with adjustable <b>headrests</b> to the high back units with built-in <b>headrests</b> introduced the previous year on Camaros and Vegas. Despite the lack of change, Nova had its best sales season in years, with production of the 1972 models reaching 349,733. Of these, 139,769 had the six-cylinder engine.|$|E

40|$|When virtual audio {{reproduction}} is simultaneously required in many seats, {{such as in}} aircraft or cinemas, it may be convenient to use loudspeakers mounted inside each seat's <b>headrest.</b> In this preliminary study, the feasibility of virtual audio reproduction in the <b>headrest</b> of a single seat is explored using an inversion technique to compensate for crosstalk and the synthesis of head related transfer functions. Although large changes in {{the magnitude of the}} signals reproduced at the listener's ears are observed as the listener moves their head within the <b>headrest,</b> informal listening tests indicate that the reproduced acoustic images are surprisingly stable in about an eighth of an arc either side of the loudspeaker positions. Not surprisingly, frontal images are more difficult to reproduce with <b>headrest</b> loudspeakers...|$|R

25|$|Early {{examples}} of the D.V featured a large <b>headrest,</b> which was usually removed in service because it interfered with the pilot's field of view. The <b>headrest</b> was deleted from the second production batch. Aircraft deployed in Palestine used two wing radiators, {{to cope with the}} warmer climate.|$|R

50|$|The Boeing XP-936 {{was still}} tricky to land; sometimes, {{because of the}} short nose, it tended to roll onto its back and would flip forward, {{injuring}} a number of pilots. The prototype's unarmored <b>headrest</b> offered virtually no protection in such instances. As a result, production Model 266s ("P-26A"s) had a taller, armored <b>headrest</b> installed.|$|R

Embroidered Cassini medallions were featured on the <b>headrests.</b> The glove compartment door, trunk lid, front fender, and hood featured Cassini's signature.|$|E
25|$|In an automobile, the {{headrest}} or {{head restraint}} is a device {{attached to the}} top of the seat behind the occupant's head. Most <b>headrests</b> are cushioned for comfort, are height adjustable and most commonly finished in the same material as the rest of the seat. The automobile headrest was invented by Benjamin Katz, a resident of Oakland, California, in 1921. U.S. patent #1,471,168 for the headrest was issued to Katz on October 16, 1923.|$|E

40|$|Neuropraxia of {{the greater}} {{auricular}} nerve is an uncommon complication of shoulder surgery, with the patient in the beach chair position. The greater auricular nerve, a superficial branch of the cervical plexus, is vulnerable to neuropraxia due to its superficial anatomical location. In this case series, we present three cases of neuropraxia associated with direct compression by a horseshoe <b>headrest,</b> used in routine positioning for uncomplicated shoulder surgery. We outline the risk of using devices of this nature and discourage the use of similar <b>headrest</b> devices due to the potential complications in <b>headrest</b> devices that exert pressure on the posterior auricular area to maintain head position during surgery. <br /...|$|R
