40|$|In Europe {{almost all}} {{countries}} have implemented {{some form of}} e-government, {{not to mention the}} UK and Norway which are now both well into their sixth year of e-government implementation. These six years have seen various strategic plans formulated, implemented and also intermittently postponed in the two countries. Although time may result in the amplification of e-government experience for Norway and the UK, the postponement of <b>implementation</b> <b>deadlines</b> indicates that not only political and social issues, but also strategic and organisational issues need to be addressed when formulating plans for deploying e-government. Using empirical research this paper examines the strategies adopted by the UK and Norway in the context of aligning central and local government plans for implementing e-government services. While technical, political and social issues are considered as key areas to be addressed in any e-government exploitation plan; this paper examines how different perspectives on e-government definition, strategy, awareness and related organisational change influence implementation. The need to align central and local e-government plans, guidelines for local level implementation, user centred solutions, strong leadership and a common understanding of the definition of e-government are highlighted in the paper as some of the key components of good e-government implementation practice. 1...|$|E

Report of the Commission presented in 1987 by GH Brundtland, entitled "Our Common Future" provided the first universally accepted definition of sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the opportunities of future generations to meet their own needs". Brundtland Report, 1987, was reaffirmed by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development / Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro - Brazil, 1992 which established the principles of Agenda 21, which was intended to be a guide implementation of sustainable development for the 21 st century, a development that was required to be applied at national, regional and local level.

40|$|In {{hypermedia}} systems, links {{are used}} to connect related information in different types of media, for example: text, images, sound, etc. In this way, authors and users have means of accessing the information in a non-sequential manner, {{in the way they}} prefer, by following links that may be visualised as highlighted text or by other means. However, when simply following links while seeking information, users may become disoriented and frustrated at their lack of ability to find specific or useful pieces of information. This is why the integration of information-retrieval techniques into such systems makes sense. The search for information can then be as well satisfied by specifying an information-retrieval query. Some systems already show this integration between hypermedia and information-retrieval systems. However they are usually only capable of text retrieval (Frei et al, 1995) or, when they have real content based multimedia information-retrieval capabilities (Lewis et al., 1996), the efficiency and effectiveness are very low. To overcome this problem we have developed a hypermedia information-retrieval integration solution that uses automatically created text descriptors to achieve multimedia information-retrieval using text retrieval techniques (Dunlop et al., 1993). In this work, there were two main aspects under consideration: - The automatic creation of text descriptors for multimedia documents, using information taken from the hypermedia network both at the document level and the abstract classification level. The type of information considered as part of this process includes link types, link descriptions, link anchors, keywords and logical classification concepts. -The integration of open hypermedia systems, in this case the Microcosm system (Davis et al., 1992), with text information-retrieval tools to allow multimedia retrieval using text descriptors for non-text media. After the implementation of this solution we presented some results and conclusions about the effectiveness of such a system. Supported by the conclusions and after further suggestions found on research where navigation through concepts was possible (Crouch, 1989, Cunliffe, 1997) we then present the skeleton of a model. For this model major concern is placed on the integration between structure information from hypermedia and content information from information retrieval systems, both at the document level or at the abstract level of navigation. This will allow {{the creation of a new}} system where there is no clear distinction between navigation and querying, which ever the media is considered. <b>Implementation</b> <b>deadlines</b> and testing suggestions are given at the end before overall we point out some conclusions about the research that we develop...|$|E

METHODS: In-depth mail and telephone surveys {{were followed by}} on-site interviews at all EtO-using hospitals in Massachusetts (n = 92, 96 % participation rate). RESULTS: By 1993, most hospitals had performed personal exposure monitoring for OSHA's 8 -hour action level (95 %) and the excursion limit (87 %), although most {{did not meet the}} 1985 <b>implementation</b> <b>deadline.</b> In 1993, 66 % of hospitals reported the installation of EtO alarms to fulfill the standard's "alert" requirement.
