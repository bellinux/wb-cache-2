The School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering of the North-West University is {{conducting}} research about RFID (radio frequency identification) medium range reader systems {{for an international}} company, iPico. The focus area of the present research {{is the development of}} a robust tag detection algorithm for noisy environments. During the past three years a <b>digital</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm was developed. This <b>digital</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm delivered significant improvements in detection of RFIDs over its analogue counterpart, especially in noisy environments. However, the <b>digital</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm was found to be very sensitive with regard to data rate deviations. Although the latter algorithm improved the detection of RFIDs, ghost (absent) tags were now also detected. The objectives of this project are, to develop an enhanced detection algorithm which is less sensitive to frequency deviations and to eliminate the appearance of the so called ghost tags. The proposed enhanced algorithm will be implemented on a FPGA (field programmable gate array), more specific the Altera Cyclone EP 1 CT 144 C 6 FPGA. Master...|$|E

Here, we report a key step towards <b>digital</b> <b>detection</b> of proteins using a highly parallel microfluidic droplet approach for single enzyme molecule detection in picoliter droplets via enzyme catalyzed signal amplification. An integrated microfluidic chip was designed for high throughput uniform droplet generation, monolayer droplet collection, incubation, detection, and release. Single beta-galatosidase (beta-Gal) molecules and the fluorogenic substrate fluorescein di-beta-D-galactopyranoside were injected from two separated inlets to form uniform 20 mu m droplets in fluorinated oil at a frequency of 6. 6 kHz. About 200 000 droplets were captured as a monolayer in a capture well on-chip for subsequent imaging detection. A series of beta-Gal solutions at different concentrations were analyzed at the single-molecule level. With no enzyme present, no droplets were found to fluoresce, while brightly fluorescent droplets were observed under single-enzyme molecule conditions. Droplet fluorescence intensity distribution analysis showed that the distribution of enzyme molecules under single-molecule conditions matched well with theoretical prediction, further proving the feasibility of detecting single enzyme molecules in emulsion droplets. Moreover, the population of fluorescent droplets increased as the beta-Gal concentration increased. Based on a digital counting method, the measured concentrations of the enzyme were found to match well with input enzyme concentration, establishing the accuracy of the <b>digital</b> <b>detection</b> method for the quantification of beta-Gal enzyme molecules. The capability of highly parallel detection of single enzyme molecules in uniform picoliter droplets paves the way to microdroplet based <b>digital</b> <b>detection</b> of proteins.

Monitoring techniques based on multispectral satellite-acquired data have demonstrated potential as a means to detect, identify, and map changes in forest cover. This paper, which reviews the methods and the results of <b>digital</b> change <b>detection</b> primarily in temperate {{forest ecosystems}}, has two major components. First, the different perspectives from which the variability in the change event has been approached are summarized, and the appropriate choice of digital imagery acquisition dates and interval length for change detection are discussed. In the second part, preprocessing routines to establish a more direct linkage between digital remote sensing data and biophysical phenomena, and the actual change detection methods themselves are reviewed and critically assessed. A case study in temperate forests (north-central U. S. A.) then serves as an illustration of how the different change detection phases discussed in this paper can be integrated into an efficient and successful monitoring technique. Lastly, new developments in <b>digital</b> change <b>detection</b> such as the use of radar imagery and knowledge-based expert systems are highlighted.
