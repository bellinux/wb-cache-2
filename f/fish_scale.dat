25|$|When Napoleon Bonaparte was crowned as Emperor of the French in 1804, he {{revived the}} style and {{grandeur}} of jewellery and fashion in France. Under Napoleon’s rule, jewellers introduced parures, suites of matching jewellery, such as a diamond tiara, diamond earrings, diamond rings, a diamond brooch, and a diamond necklace. Both of Napoleon’s wives had beautiful sets such as these and wore them regularly. Another fashion trend resurrected by Napoleon was the cameo. Soon after his cameo decorated crown was seen, cameos were highly sought. The period also saw {{the early stages of}} costume jewellery, with <b>fish</b> <b>scale</b> covered glass beads in place of pearls or conch shell cameos instead of stone cameos. New terms were coined to differentiate the arts: jewellers who worked in cheaper materials were called bijoutiers, while jewellers who worked with expensive materials were called joailliers, a practice which continues to this day.|$|E
500|$|On Stranger Tides {{employed}} 1,112 {{shots of}} computer-generated imagery, which were done by ten visual effects companies. Cinesite visual effects supervisor Simon Stanley-Clamp {{claimed that the}} most difficult part was doing the effects in 3D: [...] "Rotoscoping is tricky. Cleaning up plates is double the work, and tracking has to be spot on." [...] The lead companies, with over 300 effects each, were Industrial Light & Magic—responsible for, among others, the mermaids and most water effects—and Moving Picture Company, who created digital ships and environment extensions, such as changing weather and designing cliffs and waterfalls. Filming the mermaids involved eight model-actresses, who portrayed them outside the water, as well as 22 synchronized swimming athletes and a group of stuntwomen, both of whom wore motion capture suits to be later replaced by digital mermaids. Mermaid corpses were depicted by plaster models. The design tried to avoid the traditional representations of mermaids in paintings and literature, instead going for a scaly body with a translucent membrane inspired by both jellyfish and the fabric employed in ballet tutus. To make the mermaids more menacing underwater, the faces of the actresses had some digital touch-ups on the underwater scenes, adding sharper teeth and a shimmery <b>fish</b> <b>scale</b> quality on the skin. ILM also handled Blackbeard's death, where Ian McShane's actual performance was covered by digital doubles which turned him into a [...] "boiling mass of blood and clothing", and a hurricane-like formation that represented [...] "the waters of the Fountain taking his life". Cinesite handled the recreation of London and Barbossa's peg leg, CIS Hollywood did 3D corrections and minor shots, and Method Studios created matte paintings.|$|E

Type I collagen has been also extracted from skin, bone, fins and scales {{of fresh water}} and marine <b>fishes.</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>scales</b> are composed of collagen covered with calcium salts. In the present study we report the preparation of collagen from <b>fish</b> <b>scales</b> for potential cosmetic, pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. In our laboratory collagen was isolated from scales of Esox lucius. It {{was the first time}} that this species were used as sources of collagen. Extraction of collagen from <b>fish</b> <b>scales</b> was done in two steps. In the first step, <b>fish</b> <b>scales</b> were demineralized using EDTA. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis of demineralized scale was carried out for quantitative estimation of inorganic content. Then, demineralized <b>fish</b> <b>scales</b> were dissolved in acetic acid.

40|$|A {{detailed}} stratigraphic and sedimentologic {{study of}} the Early Cenomanian <b>Fish</b> <b>Scales</b> Formation and the Barons Sandstone in southern Alberta, based on detailed core measurement and well log correlation, was undertaken {{in order to assess}} the principal controlling factors on the mid-Cretaceous stratigraphic fill of the Cordilleran foreland basin. Fine-grained units in the basin, such as the <b>Fish</b> <b>Scales</b> Formation (Mowry equivalent) and the Early Turonian Second White Specks Formation (Greenhorn equivalent), have traditionally been attributed to deposition during episodes of high eustatic sea levels. However, facies, allostratigraphy, and isopach patterns of the latest Albian Westgate, <b>Fish</b> <b>Scales,</b> mid–late Cenomanian Belle Fourche and Second White Specks formations in southern Alberta suggest that strata were deposited alternately during orogenic loading periods and unloading periods. We interpreted the <b>Fish</b> <b>Scales</b> Formation, a deposit formed during the marine transgression of the Mowry Seaway in the latest Albian–earliest Cenomanian, to have been deposited in a wide shallow interior seaway during an orogenic unloading period. The Barons Sandstone, interbedded with the mudstone of the <b>Fish</b> <b>Scales</b> Formation, is interpreted as a regressive shoreface, distributary channel and barrier island sandstone deposited during the unloading period. We also tentatively interpreted the Second White Specks Formation, a regional stratigraphic marker deposited during the so-called peak eustatic sea level in the Early Turonian, to have been deposited in a wide shallow interior seaway during a period of regional orogenic unloading. This study questions the significance of the Mowry Shale and Greenhorn Formation as indicators of eustatic highstands of sea level, and suggests regional tectonism as the primary control on basin evolution.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{potential}} of <b>fish</b> <b>scales</b> as a suitable biosorbent for removal of Cr(VI) ions from aqueous solutions was investigated at various temperatures. The influence of temperature on equilibrium, kinetics as well as thermodynamic parameters was investigated.

Amongst the various kinetic models tested, the pseudo-first-order kinetic model represented the best correlation for the biosorption of Cr(VI) onto <b>fish</b> <b>scales</b> at various temperatures. In addition, various thermodynamic parameters such as ?Go, ?Ho and ?So were also determined. The biosorption of Cr(VI) was found to be a spontaneous and endothermic process...|$|R
