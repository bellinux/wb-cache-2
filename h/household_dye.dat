40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 88 - 93) Five consumer - applied household product s {{were tested}} on durable press finished and unfinished polyester/cotton and rayon /acetate fabric. The products tested included a <b>household</b> <b>dye,</b> a resin-bonded pigment, a water and oily stain repel lent, a flame retardant, and a perspiration resistant finish. Twelve tests {{were performed to}} evaluate the end-use of the product and selected changes in the fabrics. The hypotheses that the product would cause changes in the physical and / or performance characteristics of the fabrics other than those changes intended by the manufacturer were accepted for all five products. Statistically significant changes in breaking strength, tear resistance, and wrinkle recovery were recorded. Marked changes in fire resistance, dimension, yarn count, oil and water repellency, and color fastness to light, laundering, crocking and perspiration occurred. The literature was reviewed {{in terms of the}} properties of the chemical contents of each product...|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} dyes {{can be used}} in tie-dyeing, {{including}} household, fiber reactive, acid, and vat dyes. Most early (1960s) tie-dyes were made with retail <b>household</b> <b>dyes,</b> particularly those made by Rit. In order to be effective on different fibers, these dyes are composed of several different dyes, and thus are less effective, and more likely to bleed and fade, than pure dyes designed for specific fibers. This is the basis for the famous 'pink socks' phenomenon that occurs when fabrics dyed with mixed dyes are washed with other garments. Most tie-dyes are now dyed with Procion MX fiber reactive dyes, a class of dyes effective on cellulose fibers such as cotton, hemp, rayon, and linen. This class of dyes reacts with fibers at alkaline (high) pH, forming a wash-fast, permanent bond. Soda ash (sodium carbonate) is the most common agent used to raise the pH and initiate the reaction, and is either added directly to the dye, or in a solution of water in which garments are soaked before dyeing. Procion dyes are relatively safe and simple to use, and are the same dyes used commercially to color cellulosic fabrics.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to situate {{practicing}} of natural dyeing {{in the context of}} cultural heritage. By studying natural dyeing from a practitioners perspective, the goal is to put focus {{on the role of the}} individual in the value assessment of cultural heritage. The the-sis examines how to perceive the practice of natural dyeing as cultural heritage, how practitioners perceive and perform their craft, and mainly what incentives the practition-ers have for exerting natural dyeing. The study has been conducted through literature studies as well as interviews with practitioners. The study shows that natural dyes has been attendant in human life through history. The literature on the subject is mainly instructive, containing detailed recipes on <b>household</b> <b>dyeing.</b> The Swedish handicrafts movement along with Folkbildningsrörelsen can be said to have played important roles in conserving the knowledge about natural dyes during early 18 th century. The analysis of the conducted interviews shows that the aspects on natural dyeing most emphasized by the informants is social interaction and the dyeing process. Also curiosity and meditativity is regarded rather important. The tendency to perceive natural dyeing as heritage as well as exerting the tradition can be said to depend on the practitioners own preferences.
