5|$|A crisis erupted {{over the}} writs of {{assistance}} on December 27, 1760, {{when the news}} of King George II's death on October 23 arrived in Boston.

5|$|Djokovic <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> defeat one of {{the other}} three members 16 times in order to win his 12 titles. This {{includes}} 7 wins over Federer (3 finals, 4 semifinals), 6 wins over Murray (5 finals, 1 semifinal), and 3 wins over Nadal (3 finals). Furthermore, in order to win 4 of his 12 titles, he <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> defeat two of the Big Four in the same tournament. On 2 occasions he <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> defeat Federer and Murray, on 1 occasion he <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> defeat Nadal and Federer, and on 1 occasion he <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> defeat Nadal and Murray.|$|R

5|$|In 1864 the Board {{decided to}} seek powers {{to extend the}} railway beyond Gupworthy to {{workings}} in Joyce's Cleeve in the Quarme Valley. Preliminary notices to this effect were published, but no application was made. Had the line been built it would have entailed another incline, which ore would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> ascend before travelling eastwards to Brendon Hill where it would travel down again.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} provide enough {{capacity}} for the line, the GG would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be taken off of the Queens Boulevard Line, and a turnback was necessary to provide a new terminal for the line. When the 63rd Street Connection opened in 2001, the Court Square station was rebuilt to provide a turnback facility for the line, which by then was renamed to G.|$|E
5|$|Lawyers for The Progressive voluntarily {{underwent}} {{security reviews}} and were granted Q clearances {{that allowed them}} to access restricted nuclear information. Morland and The Progressives editors declined to obtain clearances, as they would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sign non-disclosure agreements that would have prevented them from publishing the article.

5|$|Like other minks, {{individual}} sea minks {{may have}} maintained home ranges, and, since the males were larger and required more food, males {{would have had}} larger territorial claims. Likewise, their larger size may have allowed the males to target larger prey than the females, and they may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> defend females during mating seasons. Like other weasels, the sea mink was probably polygynandrous, with both sexes mating with multiple individuals.|$|E
5|$|Like the Shieldings’ lookout, {{one made}} {{guardian}} of the gateway to Lejre would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be trusted, and perhaps connected to the king by family or loyalty; the guardian would at least occupy an important position in the military hierarchy. Adornments like the Gevninge helmet fragment would have served to identify the rank of such a person, adding decoration to a helmet meant {{for more than just}} protection.|$|E
5|$|Molecular clock {{estimates}} {{indicate that}} lemurs and the lorisoids diverged in Africa during the Paleocene, approximately 62mya. Between 47 and 54mya, lemurs dispersed to Madagascar by rafting. In isolation, the lemurs diversified {{and filled the}} niches often filled by monkeys and apes today. In Africa, the lorises and galagos diverged during the Eocene, approximately 40mya. Unlike the lemurs in Madagascar, they <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> compete with monkeys and apes, {{as well as other}} mammals.|$|E

5|$|Written by Terence Greer, a scene {{breakdown}} {{for this}} four-part story was commissioned on 13 June 1980. It was finally rejected sometime after April 1981 and was originally submitted featuring the Fourth Doctor.

5|$|A {{mathematical}} look at {{the voting}} numbers reveals that Bush would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> win 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn {{a majority of the}} vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|E

5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of the reactors to DuPont. There was friction between the company and Wigner and his team. Major differences between Wigner's reactor design and DuPont's included {{increasing the number of}} process tubes from 1,500 in a circular array to 2,004 in a square array, and cutting the power from 500 MW to 250 MW. As it turned out, the design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional tubes came in handy when neutron poisoning became a problem for the B Reactor at the Hanford Site. The extra tubes allowed a greater fuel load to overcome the poisoning. Without them the reactor would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be run at low power until enough of the boron impurities in the graphite had been burned up to allow it to reach full power, which would have delayed full operation by up to a year.|$|E
5|$|Although earlier {{theories}} {{postulated that}} large lakes formed from glacial meltwater, increased precipitation or decreased evaporation (or both) are today considered necessary for lake formation; a complete glacial melting would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> occur {{in less than}} about a century to produce the required volume. The water volume would be insufficient to explain Lake Tauca's high water levels; however, some smaller lakes in the southern Altiplano probably expanded from glacial meltwater alone. The lake {{may have contributed to}} increased precipitation by influencing land breezes. According to strontium isotope data, there may have been little water exchange between Tauca's Uyuni and Coipasa basins. During the Coipasa lake cycle, the Coipasa-Uyuni and Poopó basins had a limited connection. Minor water-level fluctuations occurred during the lake's existence.|$|E
5|$|Although other {{contemporary}} vessels {{like the}} American North Carolina-class battleships carried 40.6cm main guns, the Bismarcks used 38-cm naval guns as the Germans had experience with them; a 40.6cm weapon would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{have been designed}} from scratch. Bismarck was also authorized prior to {{the breakdown of the}} London Naval Treaty and the invocation of the 45,000-ton, 406mm main gun escalator clause (which the United States did invoke with the North Carolinas); building 40.6cm battleships would doubtless have seemed provocative, especially to the United Kingdom. As it was, the 38cm main battery of the Bismarck class compared well to their contemporaries, out-ranging most of the 38cm and 40.6cm guns of contemporary navies (with the exception of the Italian 38.1cm and French 38cm guns, of which the Italian gun suffered from exceptional bore erosion and the French gun from unusually poor accuracy).|$|E

5|$|Although {{the idea}} of {{becoming}} a marine zoologist interested him, Franco had always secretly wanted to become an actor but feared being rejected. He enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as an English major, but dropped out after his first year against his parents' wishes {{to pursue a career}} as an actor, since he would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> wait two years to audition for their acting program. Franco instead chose to take acting lessons with Robert Carnegie at the Playhouse West. Around this time, Franco took up a late-night job at McDonald's to support himself because his parents refused to do so. He was a vegetarian until working there. While working at the establishment, he would practice accents on customers, an experience he remembered nostalgically in a 2015 Washington Post editorial ("McDonald’s was there for me when no one else was").|$|E
5|$|Another claim {{involved}} alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, it would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.|$|E
5|$|Another {{theory is}} that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the {{apartment}} by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell {{into one of the}} open construction sites nearby.

According to her mother, Madeleine would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the door again, open and close the child gate {{at the top of the}} stairs, then open and close the gate leading to the street.|$|E
