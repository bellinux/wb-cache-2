Went's experiment identified how a <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> chemical causes a coleoptile to grow towards light. Went cut {{the tips of the}} coleoptiles and placed them in the dark, putting a few tips on agar blocks that he predicted would absorb the growth-promoting chemical. On control coleoptiles, he placed a block that lacked the chemical. On others, he placed blocks containing the chemical, either centred on top of the coleoptile to distribute the chemical evenly or offset to increase the concentration on one side.|$|E
25|$|Fungal endophytes {{which provide}} {{defensive}} services to their host plants may exert selective pressures favouring association through enhanced fitness relative to uninfected hosts. The fungus Neotyphodium spp. infects grasses and increases fitness under conditions {{with high levels}} of interspecific competition. It does this through a combination of benefits including anti-herbivore defenses and <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> factors. The customary assumption that plant growth promotion is the main way fungal mutualists improve fitness under attack from herbivores is changing; alteration of plant chemical composition and induced resistance are now recognized as factors of great importance in improving competitive ability and fecundity. Plants undefended by chemical or physical means at certain points in their life histories have higher survival rates when infected with beneficial endophytic fungi. The general trend of plants infected with mutualistic fungi outperforming uninfected plants under moderate to high herbivory exerts selection for higher levels of fungal association as herbivory levels increase. Unsurprisingly, low to moderate levels of herbivore damage also increases the levels of infection by beneficial endophytic fungi.|$|E

40|$|Using a tumor {{model of}} spontaneously arising insulinomas expressing a defined tumor-associated antigen, we {{investigated}} whether tumor <b>growth</b> <b>promotes</b> cross-presentation and tolerance of tumor-specific T cells. We {{found that an}} advanced tumor burden enhanced cross-presentation of tumor-associated antigens to high avidity tumor-specific T cells, inducing T cell proliferation and limited effector function in vivo. However, contrary to other models, tumor-specific T cells were not tolerized despite a high tumor burden. In fact, in tumor-bearing mice, persistence and responsiveness of adoptively transferred tumor-specific T cells were enhanced. Accordingly, a potent T cell–mediated antitumor response could be elicited by intravenous administration of tumor-derived peptide and agonistic anti-CD 40 antibody or viral immunization and reimmunization.
