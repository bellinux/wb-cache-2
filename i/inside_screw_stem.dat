40|$|A screw {{conveyer}} is extensively used as {{transport equipment}} for granular materials. Until now, {{there have been}} several reports investigating the characteristics of the screw conveyer, the influence of the rotational speed of the screw shaft, the size and the shape of a screw blade and a filling ratio of granules on the transport efficiency of the screw conveyer. However, a study of the transport mechanism of granules has rarely been reported. The mechanism of transportation <b>inside</b> the <b>screw</b> conveyer is very complicated. Therefore, it is difficult to understand the dynamic behavior of granules quantitatively. In this paper, in order to grasp the transporting state <b>inside</b> the <b>screw</b> conveyer from phenomenal aspects, it is expressed using two parameters i. e. the transport quantity and the leakage quantity in the stationary state.

40|$|Granular mixing has a {{significant}} influence on the resulting products {{in a variety of}} industries, such as pharmaceutical production, food processing, and energy generation. Most commonly, granular mixing processes seek a high degree of homogeneity, and in some particular instances, the purpose is to influence simultaneous processing, such as chemical reactions and heat and/or mass transfer rates. Granular mixing is a complex process because it exhibits multiple rheological differences, many times simultaneously within the same granular bed. A fundamental problem commonly encountered during the mixing of granular materials is the tendency for mixtures to segregate due to differences in particle size, shape, and/or density. While significant effort has been made to improve the granular mixing process, the vast majority of granular mixing research efforts have focused on relatively simple mixer geometries and idealized granular materials compared to what is actually used in industrial practice. For example, the renewable energy industry, or more specifically the biomass thermochemical conversion sector, relies on double screw pyrolyzers to convert cellulosic biomass into bio-oil. Currently, there is a large amount of research that relates the feedstocks being used to the bio-oil yields; however, minimal research efforts have been directed toward studying the granular mixing dynamics <b>inside</b> the double <b>screw</b> pyrolyzer due to the opaque nature of the reactor and the granular flow itself. The overall goal of this project is to thoroughly understand, characterize, and optimize the granular mixing of low density red oak chips and high density glass beads within a double screw mixer, which geometrically replicates screw pyrolyzers, under various operating conditions. Moreover, it aims to provide an improved understanding of the biomass and heat carrier media granular mixing dynamics <b>inside</b> the <b>screw</b> pyrolyzer. The increased mixing effectiveness and insight gained through this project will lead to increased heat transfer rates and could enhance product yield and/or quality; thereby improving the economic viability of a screw pyrolyzer. Throughout this project, a number of different visualization and quantification techniques have been developed and used to evaluate the mixing effectiveness of red oak chips and glass beads <b>inside</b> a <b>screw</b> mixer that was designed and constructed specifically for granular mixing studies. Four parameters were initially investigated: (i) screw rotation speed, (ii) dimensionless screw pitch, (iii) screw rotation orientation, and (iv) material injection configuration. After identifying the influence that these parameters had on the mixing effectiveness, the effect of the dimensionless mixing length was also investigated. Advanced optical visualization methods were first developed by capturing, and then spatially aligning and temporally syncing four independent projections of the screw mixer. Next, an improved granular sampling procedure which satisfies the two 2 ̆ 2 golden rules of sampling 2 ̆ 2 was developed. Composition analysis of the samples was then coupled to analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical methods to qualitatively assess the spatial heterogeneity of the granular mixing process. Together, the qualitative optical visualization and quantitative composition and statistical analysis lead to the optimization of the screw mixer 2 ̆ 7 s operating conditions. For the range of parameters that were studied, these conditions were determined to be a screw rotation speed of ω = 60 rpm, a dimensionless screw pitch of p/D = 1. 75, a counter-rotating down-pumping screw rotation orientation (CtrR DP), and a material injection configuration with the red oak chips and glass beads injected into port one and two (RO 1, GB 2), respectively. Studies which investigated the mixing effectiveness of the screw mixer {{as a function of the}} dimensionless mixing length also indicated that this operating condition lead to the most homogeneous mixture at each of the tested dimensionless mixing lengths. An improved cone-beam compensated back-projection algorithm enabling X-ray particle tracking velocimetry (XPTV) of the screw mixer was then developed to visualize and quantify the 3 D granular flow structures <b>inside</b> the <b>screw</b> mixer under various operating condition using 2 ̆ 2 modified 2 ̆ 2 red oak chip tracer particles. It was shown that these improved XPTV methods provided {{a significant}} reduction in error associated with the tracer particle 2 ̆ 7 s position. The influence of the aforementioned four factors on the granular flow structures <b>inside</b> the <b>screw</b> mixer were investigated using XPTV, and similar results in terms of the desired operating conditions to those from the previous studies were noted. Moreover, the counter-rotating down-pumping screw rotation orientation, which was found to be the most influential factor using the composition and statistical analysis methods, was also shown to increase the material residence time, resulting in a longer mixing time. A number of different methods were developed and used to characterize the granular mixing process <b>inside</b> the <b>screw</b> mixer. While each of the methods provided a different view on mixing behavior, the studies converged on a single double screw mixer operating condition, leading to a conclusive mixing effectiveness optimization...|$|R
40|$|Small scale Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) {{systems have}} a big {{potential}} for waste heat recovery in the market. Due to the smaller volume flows inside these systems, non-conventional expansion technologies such as screw expanders become more interesting. Recent economic studies have shown {{the important role of}} screw machines in such cycles. However, {{in order to get a}} better understanding of the expansion behaviour in an ORC, appropriate simulation models of screw expanders are necessary. The flow inside an oil-injected twin screw expander is modeled in detail with 3 D CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) calculations. These simulations are challenging because of the deforming domain and the narrow gaps between the screws or between a screw and the casing. The deforming mesh motion is handled by an in-house code which generates a block-structured grid with the help of the solutions of the Laplace problem. The oil-phase was modeled with an Eulerian multiphase model and the working fluid is treated compressible. The performance of the screw expander is strongly affected by the oil-injection which provides lubrication and a better sealing of the gaps. Therefore, the different types of leakages <b>inside</b> the <b>screw</b> expander are studied and monitored.

Non-destructive tests (NDTs) are used along with the traditional approach of core testing for strength assessment of concrete in existing structures. The low reliability of NDT results leads to uncertainty in assessing concrete strength. A new method of non-destructive testing is {{presented in this paper}} with the aim of achieving better reliability and reducing uncertainty in the assessment of mortar strength.

30|$|The {{stability}} of the implant-abutment connection comes from both the screw function and the frictional resistance between the conical, contacting metallic surfaces of the connection [10]. An abutment screw provides stability via a clamping force [11, 12]. When rotational torque {{is applied to the}} screw, the screw elongates and causes stress on the stem and threads. After that, elastic recovery of the <b>screw</b> occurs, the <b>stem</b> and threads of the screw are in tension and a clamping force is created, pulling the abutment and the implant together. This clamping force is parallel to the axis of the implant and is also known as preload. The preload value is directly proportional to screw elongation. The more screw elongation remains after elastic recovery, the greater is the preload value.|$|R

Concentration of liquid in the inlet flow can influence the performance of the machine significantly. Characteristics of the multiphase flow at the suction of a screw compressor depend on the local flow velocities and concentration. Local flow velocity measurements <b>inside</b> the <b>screw</b> compressors are difficult to obtain. However other flow properties such as local pressures are easier to attain. It is therefore useful to carry out experiments with local pressure variations in the suction which can be used to validate the 3 D numerical Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) models that could help in studying the single and multiphase flow behaviour in screw compressors. This paper presents experimental efforts to measure the local pressure losses inside the suction plenum of the screw compressor. Pressure variations are measured at 23 locations in the suction port at various operating conditions and compared with 3 D CFD model.
