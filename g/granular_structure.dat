25|$|Sucralose is {{a highly}} {{heat-stable}} noncaloric sweetener, allowing it {{to be used in}} many recipes with little or no sugar. It is available in a granulated form that allows for same-volume substitution with sugar. This mix of granulated sucralose includes fillers, all of which rapidly dissolve in liquids. While the granulated sucralose provides apparent volume-for-volume sweetness, the texture in baked products may be noticeably different. Sucralose is not hygroscopic, which can lead to baked goods that are noticeably drier and manifest a less dense texture than those made with sucrose. Unlike sucrose, which melts when baked at high temperatures, sucralose maintains its <b>granular</b> <b>structure</b> when subjected to dry, high heat (e.g., in a 350°F or 180°C oven). Furthermore, in its pure state, sucralose begins to decompose at 119°C or 246°F. Thus, in some baking recipes, such as crème brûlée, which require sugar sprinkled on top to partially or fully melt and crystallize, substituting sucralose will not result in the same surface texture, crispness, or crystalline structure.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dominant}} {{surface soil}} category of Bennett Valley is Clear Lake clay, a soil type occurring here on slopes ranging {{from zero to}} two percent gradient. [...] Clear Lake clay is poorly drained and occurs on long smooth flood plains. [...] Clear Lake clay is found {{on both sides of}} Matanzas Creek, which flows northwesterly along the axis of Bennett Valley. [...] Clear Lake clay is dark gray in appearance and manifests a fine to medium <b>granular</b> <b>structure,</b> most commonly supporting hay production in the Bennett Valley. [...] In addition, Zamora silty clay loam is found in several large patches on the valley floor; Zamora silty clay loam is a grayish brown firm, sticky and plastic soil type and is also characteristic of alluvial fans; it has a neutral pH and occurs at minimum depths of about two meters. [...] Due to the economic demand for wine grapes in this region, pressure began in the 1980s to develop some of the Bennett Valley soils for viticulture.|$|E
60|$|In {{the lava}} {{and in the}} scoriae of this little crater, I found several {{fragments}}, which, from their angular form, their <b>granular</b> <b>structure,</b> their freedom from air-cells, their brittle and burnt condition, closely resembled those fragments of primary rocks which are occasionally ejected, as at Ascension, from volcanoes. These fragments consist of glassy albite, much mackled, and with very imperfect cleavages, mingled with semi-rounded grains, having tarnished, glossy surfaces, of a steel-blue mineral. The crystals of albite are coated by a red oxide of iron, appearing like a residual substance; and their cleavage-planes also are sometimes separated by excessively fine layers of this oxide, giving to the crystals the appearance of being ruled like a glass micrometer. There was no quartz. The steel-blue mineral, which is abundant in the pinnacle, but which disappears in the streams derived from the pinnacle, has a fused appearance, and rarely presents even a trace of cleavage; I obtained, however, one measurement, which proved that it was augite; and in one other fragment, which differed from the others, in being slightly cellular, and in gradually blending into the surrounding matrix the small grains of this mineral were tolerably well crystallised. Although there is so wide a difference in appearance between the lava of the little streams, and especially of their red scoriaceous crusts, and one of these angular ejected fragments, which at first sight might readily be mistaken for syenite, yet I believe that the lava has originated from the melting and movement of a mass of rock of absolutely similar composition with the fragments. Besides the specimen above alluded to, in which we see a fragment becoming slightly cellular, and blending into the surrounding matrix, some of the grains of the steel-blue augite also have their surfaces becoming very finely vesicular, and passing {{into the nature of}} the surrounding paste; other grains are throughout, in an intermediate condition. The paste seems to consist of the augite more perfectly fused, or, more probably, merely disturbed in its softened state by the movement of the mass, and mingled with the oxide of iron and with finely comminuted, glassy albite. Hence probably it is that the fused albite, which is abundant in the pinnacle, disappears in the streams. The albite is in exactly the same state, with the exception of most of the crystals being smaller in the lava and in the embedded fragments; but in the fragments they appear to be less abundant: this, however, would naturally happen from the intumescence of the augitic base, and its consequent apparent increase in bulk. It is interesting thus to trace the steps by which a compact granular rock becomes converted into a vesicular, pseudo-porphyritic lava, and finally into red scoriae. The structure and composition of the embedded fragments show that they are parts either of a mass of primary rock which has undergone considerable change from volcanic action, or more probably of the crust of a body of cooled and crystallised lava, which has afterwards been broken up and re-liquified; the crust being less acted on by the renewed heat and movement.|$|E
40|$|Granular {{computing}} is {{an emerging}} {{field of study}} that attempts to formalize and explore methods and heuristics of human problem solving with multiple levels of granularity and abstraction. A fundamental issue of granular computing is the representation and utilization of <b>granular</b> <b>structures.</b> The main objective {{of this paper is}} to examine a logic approach to address this issue. Following the classical interpretation of a concept as a pair of intension and extension, we interpret a granule as a pair of a set of objects and a logic formula describing the granule. The building blocks of <b>granular</b> <b>structures</b> are basic granules representing an elementary concept or a piece of knowledge. They are treated as atomic formulas of a logic language. Different types of <b>granular</b> <b>structures</b> can be constructed by using logic connectives. Within this logic framework, we show that rough set analysis (RSA) and formal concept analysis (FCA) can be interpreted uniformly.

50|$|The main {{result of}} loop quantum gravity is the {{derivation}} of a <b>granular</b> <b>structure</b> of {{space at the}} Planck length. This is derived from following considerations: In the case of electromagnetism, the quantum operator representing the energy of each frequency of the field has a discrete spectrum. Thus the energy of each frequency is quantized, and the quanta are the photons. In the case of gravity, the operators representing the area and the volume of each surface or space region likewise have discrete spectrum. Thus area and volume of any portion of space are also quantized, where the quanta are elementary quanta of space. It follows, then, that spacetime has an elementary quantum <b>granular</b> <b>structure</b> at the Planck scale, which cuts off the ultraviolet infinities of quantum field theory.|$|E

Identical results were found in all two cell types. In interphase cells, IGs group into irregular clusters of varying size. They are frequently associated with coiled bodies and homogeneous fibrillar bodies. Analysis of serial sections reveals that IG clusters occupy distinct regions within the nucleoplasm. During prophase, the aggregation of granules in these clusters gives rise to compact, spherical, <b>granular</b> <b>structures.</b> These disperse in the mitotic cytoplasm at {{the breakdown of the}} nuclear envelope.
