Bowlby's work on delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospital and institutional care led to his being commissioned to write the World Health Organisation's report on the mental health of <b>homeless</b> <b>children</b> in post-war Europe whilst he was head of the Department for Children and Parents at the Tavistock Clinic in London after World War II.

25|$|Currently, {{federal funds}} are {{allocated}} to organizations that provide shelter {{and services to}} homeless youth in the United States through two major programs: The Runaway Youth Act, first implemented in 1974 and reauthorized in 2003 as the Runaway, Homeless and Missing Children Protection Act, and the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act.
