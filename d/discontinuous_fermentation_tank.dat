5000|$|Pigeage is a French {{winemaking}} {{term for}} the traditional grape stomping in open <b>fermentation</b> <b>tanks.</b> To make certain types of wine, grapes are put through a crusher and then poured into open <b>fermentation</b> <b>tanks.</b> Once <b>fermentation</b> begins, the grape skins are pushed to the surface by carbon dioxide gases released in the fermentation process. This layer of skins and other solids {{is known as the}} cap. As the skins are the source of the tannins, the cap needs to be mixed through the liquid each day, or [...] "punched," [...] which traditionally is done by stomping through the vat.|$|R
5000|$|Sato is brewed with {{glutinous rice}} (...) (also called sticky rice); a starter culture, a mixture {{including}} primarily sugar; yeast; and water. Traditionally, a starter culture known as luk paeng ( [...] , a small ball of starch, yeast, and mold) {{is used to}} assist in fermentation. The steamed sticky rice is mixed with luk paeng and kept in a <b>fermentation</b> <b>tank</b> for three days, as the starch in the rice changes to sugar. Water is then added to the <b>fermentation</b> <b>tank</b> and the mixture is allowed to ferment for a further week. Following that, the fresh rice wine is pressed from the dregs, and filtered.|$|R

30|$|The {{large-scale}} SSF {{was performed}} in an 80 -l stainless <b>fermentation</b> <b>tank.</b> The <b>fermentation</b> mixture contained 8.6 – 15.9 % SMCM (depending on the pretreatment), 25 FPU/g-SMCM cellulase, and 1 % dry yeast. For this fermentation, cellulase GODO TCD-H 3 (Godo Shusei Co., Ltd, Japan) was used. SMCM (with or without pretreatment) was mixed with 18  l of deionized water in the <b>fermentation</b> <b>tank.</b> The mixture was heated at 120 °C for 30  min. After cooling to 37 °C, 2  l of the cellulase solution (114 – 209  g/l depending {{on the amount of}} SMCM) and 20  g of dry yeast (Nisshin Super Camellia dry yeast; Nisshin Foods Inc., Japan) were added to the <b>fermentation</b> <b>tank.</b> The <b>fermentation</b> mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 72  h with stirring at 150  rpm. Fermented samples were removed after 24, 48, and 72  h. The supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 12, 000 ×g for 15  min and stored at − 80 °C until ethanol analysis. Ethanol yield was calculated {{on the basis of the}} amount of cellulose in SMCM without any pretreatment.|$|R

50|$|The {{next big}} {{change for the}} former Appeltofftska Brewery took place in 1920. The {{engineer}} Anders Krönlein took over the stock majority of the company. Extensive modernizations were made and the business grew. A new era began. New open <b>fermentation</b> <b>tanks</b> were bought. They were made of aluminium and now {{there was no need}} to take out the wooden vats once a year to rosin them, which took a lot of time and effort. The open <b>fermentation</b> <b>tanks</b> are still in use today. During the 1920s and 1930s machines gradually took over hard manual work like tapping, corking and labelling. For example, fully automatic tapping machines were installed.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{years there}} has been a large {{increase}} in the worldwide sales of cultured products containing probiotics. The obstacle in the production of fermented products incubated with probiotic strains is its effect on sensory, chemical and physical properties. This Master´s Thesis investigates how extended storage times in <b>fermentation</b> <b>tank</b> as well as buffer tank during production of probiotic yoghurts affect final product quality. Through experimental studies, maximum storage times for probiotic yoghurts were to be recommended. The study includes analyses of pH, viscosity, stability, acetic acid concentration, microbial viability and sensory evaluations. Design of experiments (DOE) was used to construct a 32 -factorial design for the experiment where different storage times were tested. The analyses showed that: pH decreases with both storage time in <b>fermentation</b> <b>tank</b> and buffer tank. Viscosity increases with long storage times in <b>fermentation</b> <b>tank,</b> while it decreases with long storage times in buffer tanks. Many samples had a sandy/grainy and slimy texture which could be related to high levels of Bifidobacteria or high fermentation temperatures. High levels of acetic acid was found in all samples. All measurements data where within the specification limits, whereas no recommendation for maximum storage times during production could be given...|$|R

40|$|In many {{processes}} it {{is important}} to have automatic control in the modern life. For example, PLC systems are using for machine control, water pressure and flow are able to be controlled by DDC program, even a car can be driven by computer. In this article, author will turn our focus on the control system for <b>fermentation</b> <b>tank.</b> The <b>fermentation</b> <b>tank</b> that produces methane is considered as clean and recycle energy source. It is widely used in house, electronic power machine and vehicle around the world. However, its reaction temperature and output concentration control are usually hard to detect without automation system. In this study, the problem is focused to combine <b>fermentation</b> <b>tank</b> and automatic control system in laboratory testing.   In this paper, author will be able to use PIC (Peripheral Interface Controller) microcontroller to solve this problem and automatically control the methane tank output methane gas with certain concentration, which could be used as energy source. The temperature and concentration sensors that are chosen as input data of the controller and corresponding algorithm were performed on the PIC. They will be used to realize the composition and thermal state measurement. With those information, the valves of material and water control can be controlled in methane tank.   Limited by the experiment equipment and methane reaction tank system, the controller was just tested in the laboratory environment instead of practical application. The test result shows that the controller has its capability to automatically control the stable output of methane gas. In the test, water and material valves are controlled automatically open or close after monitoring temperature and concentration information of the gas in the tank. ...|$|R
