5|$|On December 26, 2006, {{a person}} using the alias muslix64 {{published}} a utility named BackupHDDVD and its source code on the DVD decryption forum at the website Doom9. BackupHDDVD {{can be used}} to decrypt AACS protected content once one knows the encryption key. muslix64 claimed to have found title and volume keys in main memory while playing HD DVDs using a software player, and that finding them <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>difficult.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pomeranians have a thick, double coat. While {{grooming}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>difficult,</b> breeders {{recommend that}} it be done daily to maintain {{the quality of the}} coat and because of its thickness and the constant shedding, with trimming every 1–2 months. The outer coat is long, straight, and harsh in texture while the undercoat is soft, thick and short. The coat knots and tangles easily, particularly when the undercoat is being shed, which happens twice a year.|$|E

5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} {{are more}} susceptible than aluminium to external corrosion, particularly in seawater, and may be galvanized or coated with corrosion barrier paints to resist corrosion damage. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> to monitor external corrosion, and repair the paint when damaged, and steel cylinders which are well maintained have a long service life, often longer than aluminium cylinders, as they are not susceptible to fatigue damage when filled within their safe working pressure limits.|$|E
5|$|Ransomware {{is a type}} of {{malicious}} software from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion, in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files without the decryption key is an intractable problem – and difficult to trace digital currencies such as Ukash and Bitcoin are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult. Recent Ransomware attack in 2017 has caused a stir in the world as the attack caused many of the internet connected devices to not work and companies spent a large amount to recover from these attacks.|$|E

25|$|The Wnt {{signaling}} pathways {{are critical}} in cell-cell signaling during normal development and embryogenesis and required for maintenance of adult tissue, therefore it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to understand why}} disruption in Wnt signaling pathways can promote human degenerative disease and cancer.|$|E

25|$|The {{conduct of}} a Supreme Court judge cannot be {{discussed}} in Parliament, except on a substantive motion of which notice has been given by not {{less than a quarter}} of the total number of MPs.

Because William Fillingham had himself surveyed the estate {{as early as}} 1775 and had arranged to have estimates made of the improved value of Syerston if enclosed, with costs of enclosure, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> to guess his next move.|$|E
25|$|Every Heyting algebra is {{isomorphic}} {{to one of}} {{the form}} H'T. To see this, let H be any Heyting algebra, and let 〈a'i: i∈I〉 be a family of elements generating H (for example, any surjective family). Now consider the set T of formulas J(〈A'i〉) in the variables 〈A'i: i∈I〉 such that J(〈a'i〉)=1. Then we obtain a morphism f:H'T→H by the universal property of H'T, which is clearly surjective. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> to show that f is injective.|$|E
25|$|It {{was common}} {{in the past to}} use Google's cache feature to view blocked websites. However, this feature of Google seems to be under some level of blocking, as access is now erratic and does not work for blocked websites. Currently the block is mostly {{circumvented}} by using proxy servers outside the firewall, and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> to carry out for those determined to do so. Some well-known proxy servers have also been blocked. Some Chinese citizens used the Google mirror elgooG after China blocked Google.|$|E

25|$|As a rule it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to guess}} which eyes are {{which in a}} living or {{preserved}} specimen, but sometimes it can be. Apart {{from the fact that}} in some species one or more pairs may be missing, sometimes eyes from the posterior and anterior rows may be very close to each other, or even fused. Also, either one row or both might be so grossly curved that some of the notionally anterior eyes actually may lie posterior to some of the eyes in the posterior row. In some species the curve is so gross that the eyes apparently are arranged into two anteroposterior parallel rows of eyes.|$|E
25|$|Because all saxophones use {{the same}} key {{arrangement}} and fingering to produce a given notated pitch, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> for a competent player to switch among the various sizes when the music has been suitably transposed, and many do so. Since the baritone and alto are pitched in E, players can read concert pitch music notated in the bass clef by reading {{it as if it}} were treble clef and adding three sharps to the key signature. This process, referred to as clef substitution, makes it possible for the Eb instruments to play from parts written for baritone horn, bassoon, euphonium, string bass, trombone, or tuba. This can be useful if a band or orchestra lacks one of those instruments.|$|E
25|$|Calixarenes are characterised by a {{three-dimensional}} basket, cup or bucket shape. In calixarenes the internal volume is around 10 cubic angstroms. Calixarenes are characterised {{by a wide}} upper rim and a narrow lower rim and a central annulus. With phenol as a starting material the 4 hydroxyl groups are intrannular on the lower rim. In a resorcinarene 8 hydroxyl groups are placed extraannular on the upper ring. Calixarenes exist in different chemical conformations because rotation around the methylene bridge <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>difficult.</b> In calixarene 4 up-down conformations exist: cone (point group C2v,C4v), partial cone Cs, 1,2 alternate C2h and 1,3 alternate D2d. The 4 hydroxyl groups interact by hydrogen bonding and stabilize the cone conformation. This conformation is in dynamic equilibrium with the other conformations. Conformations can be locked in place with proper substituents replacing the hydroxyl groups which increase the rotational barrier. Alternatively placing a bulky substituent on the upper rim also locks a conformation. The calixarene based on p-tert-butyl phenol is also a cone. Calixarenes are structurally related to the pillararenes.|$|E
