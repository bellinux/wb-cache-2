40|$|The Fukushima Dai-ichi {{release of}} {{radionuclides}} into ocean waters caused significant {{local and global}} concern regarding the spread of radioactive material. We report unequivocal evidence that Pacific bluefin tuna, Thunnus orientalis, transported Fukushima-derived radionuclides across the entire North Pacific Ocean. We measured γ-emitting radionuclides in California-caught tunas and found 134 Cs (4. 0 ± 1. 4 Bq kg− 1) and elevated 137 Cs (6. 3 ± 1. 5 Bq kg− 1) in 15 Pacific bluefin tuna sampled in August 2011. We found no 134 Cs and background concentrations (∼ 1 Bq kg− 1) of 137 Cs in pre-Fukushima bluefin and post-Fukushima yellowfin tunas, ruling out elevated radiocesium uptake before 2011 or in California waters post-Fukushima. These findings indicate that Pacific bluefin tuna can rapidly transport radionuclides from a point source in Japan to distant ecoregions and demonstrate the importance of migratory animals as transport vectors of radionuclides. Other large, <b>highly</b> <b>migratory</b> marine animals make extensive use of waters around Japan, and these animals may also be transport vectors of Fukushima-derived radionuclides to distant regions of the North and South Pacific Oceans.

40|$|Sea turtles are <b>highly</b> <b>migratory</b> {{and usually}} dispersed, but {{aggregate}} off beaches during the nesting season, rendering them vulnerable to coastal threats. Consequently, coastal Marine Protection Areas (MPAs) {{have been used}} to facilitate the recovery of turtle populations, but the effectiveness of these programs is uncertain as most have been operating for less than a single turtle generation (or, 20 yr). South Africa, however, hosts one of the longest running conservation programs, protecting nesting loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) turtles since 1963 in a series of coastal MPAs. This provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the long-term effect of spatial protection on the abundance of two <b>highly</b> <b>migratory</b> turtle <b>species</b> with different life history characteristics. Population responses were assessed by modeling the number of nests over time in an index area (13 km) and an expanded monitoring area (53 km) with varying survey effort. Loggerhead abundance increased dramatically from, 250 to. 1700 nests pa (index area) especially over the last decade, while leatherback abundance increased initially, 10 to 70 nests pa (index area), but then stabilized. Although leatherbacks have higher reproductive output per female and comparable remigration periods and hatching success to loggerheads, the leatherback population failed to expand. Our results suggest that coastal MPAs can work but do not guarantee the recovery of sea turtle populations as pressures change over time. Causes considered for the lack of population growth include factors in the MPA (expansion into unmonitored areas or incubation environment) of outside o...|$|R

Herein, we evaluated the dolphinfish industrial fishery in Pacific Panama {{for the first time}} generating a growth model and examining fluctuations in annual total catch and in catch per unit effort (CPUE) over a four-year period (2006 - 2009). Annual and monthly catch values and biological parameters of 14 913 individuals were obtained onboard industrial vessels, landing sites and records from processing plants. Size frequency for industrial ves-sels showed a normal distribution between 353 and 1 715 mm (average, 1 010. 85 mm; n = 10 459). Fish weight averaged 4. 94 kg (SD). Sex ratio was slightly biased toward females. More than 90 % of the analyzed fish were sexually mature. The length-weight relationship was positive and significant, reflecting allometric growth. Growth parameters using the von Bertalanffy equation revealed a growth efficiency of θ = 4. 61, which is within the reported range for Coryphaena hippurus (3. 95 - 4. 70). The largest fish were between age classes 2 and 3 (700 - 1 400 mm). Total catch per year and catch per unit effort (CPUE) per year fluctuated, with the highest values recorded between 2008 and 2009.

40|$|Spatial {{variation}} in growth {{is a common}} feature of demersal fish populations which often exist as discrete adult sub-populations linked by a pelagic larval stage. However, it remains unclear whether {{variation in}} growth occurs at similar spatial scales for populations of <b>highly</b> <b>migratory</b> pelagic <b>species,</b> such as tuna. We examined spatial variation in growth of albacore Thunnus alalunga across 90 ° of longitude in the South Pacific Ocean from {{the east coast of}} Australia to the Pitcairn Islands. Using length-at-age data from a validated ageing method we found evidence for significant variation in length-at-age and growth parameters (L(∞) and k) between sexes and across longitudes. Growth trajectories were similar between sexes up until four years of age, after which the length-at-age for males was, on average, greater than that for females. Males reached an average maximum size more than 8 cm larger than females. Length-at-age and growth parameters were consistently greater at more easterly longitudes than at westerly longitudes for both females and males.

40|$|Management of <b>highly</b> <b>migratory</b> fish <b>species</b> is {{generally}} assumed to require complicated international agreements. The effects of spatial closures for such species {{are thought to}} be diluted by their extensive movements. We tested these assumptions using a case study of striped marlin (Kajikia audax) fisheries off of Baja California, Mexico. Beginning in 1977, Mexico instituted a series of long-line fishery closures and closed areas to reduce commercial fishing mortality rates on billfishes. Using data from the Japanese long-line fishery and the recreational billfish fishery in a stock reduction analysis (SRA) model, we show that temporary closures of Mexico's EEZ to longlining from 1977 - 1980 and 1984 - 1985 had a rapid effect on local abundance of striped marlin. Regional striped marlin abundance likely increased by 12 %- 22 % following the four-year closure and 6 %- 12 % following the two-year closure. Increases near Baja California may have been larger. Recreational catch-and-release appears to have a more modest effect because catches in the recreational fishery are substantially smaller than historic long-line catches. A 100 % release rate over the 10 -year period for which recreational catch data were available would likely have increased regional abundance by 2. 8 %- 7. 5 % relative to no recreational release.

This species exhibits an onshore migration during the summer related to coastal food availability, and an offshore migration towards reproductive oceanic areas (beyond Chilean EEZ) in early spring. During the spawning peaks (November) of 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001, {{jack mackerel}} eggs were collected from four systematic surveys using 8 - 10 fishing vessels, deployed in the spawning area (76 - 92 W) off central Chile. Spatial distribution of eggs was modeled by geostatistical techniques. Environmental information including SST, wind, sea level anomalies and chlorophyll-a, as well as SST gradients, turbulence and currents were calculated. Exploratory results suggest a higher egg density related to warmer waters (16 - 19 C), moderate winds (4 - 8 m s- 1) and low currents (< 15 cm s- 1) as well as SST gradients (< 0. 3 C 10 km- 1). Statistical analysis developed {{with the purpose of}} providing evidence of habitat-species association, reveal a significant relationship (p< 0. 05) between egg density and both SST and wind magnitude.

In March of 2006, we used a calibrated 38 -kHz SIMRAD EK 60 scientific sonar to assess the spatial distribution of the deep scattering layer relative to broad-scale oceanographic features and fine-scale physical and biological measurements. We conducted a single continuous transect from approximately 10 °S to 20 °N at 170 °W while measuring acoustic backscatter, current velocity and direction, temperature, salinity, oxygen, and fluorescence with depth, coincident with marine mammal occurrence. These data were combined with remotely sensed sea surface height, chlorophyll, and sea surface temperature data to examine patterns in DSL distribution. To analyze DSL density with depth, acoustic backscatter was binned into surface (3 ̆c 200 m), mid (200 – 550 m) and deep (550 – 1000 m) layers. Backscatter was highly correlated with chlorophyll-a and low sea surface height anomalies and was greatest near the equator. We found high diel variability in DSL depth and scattering intensity between the mid and surface layers {{as well as a}} shallowing of the deep layer moving northward across the equator.
