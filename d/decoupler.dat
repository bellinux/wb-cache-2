This paper proposes Partial Least Squares (PLS), multivariate statistical process control technique (MVSPC), based decoupling strategy to attain satisfactory performance and consistent product quality in spite of disturbances.

In this work analytical expressions for closed-loop interactive transfer functions are found and interaction reducers (IR) are designed (as process <b>decouplers)</b> for closed-loop control to minimize the interactions between input/outputs of distillation column. Multiloop PI controllers are tuned using different tuning rules and closed-loop systems with IRs are simulated.

40|$|Decoupling of a {{multivariable system}} is much {{pronounced}} control problem in many indus- trial process. This has received much importance since last 20 {{years to develop}} decoupling controllers {{as an alternative to}} multi-loop PI controllers in order to achieve satisfactory set- point responses when there exist multiple time delays, non-minimum phase zeros and large uncertainties. In this thesis, static and dynamic decoupling control strategies are discussed. Static <b>decouplers</b> are designed for control of multi-variable processes by RGA interaction analysis to determine the nature of interaction for static <b>decouplers</b> applied to multi-loop con- trollers and integral mode only at low and high frequencies. Here it is shown that static <b>decouplers</b> applied to integral modes perform better for processes in which non-diagonal ele- ments decrease faster as frequency increases. This approach is sensitive to process changes and require detailed models. In dynamic decoupling, internal model control and inverted decoupling methods are dis- cussed here. Internal model control approach comprises both open-loop decoupling and closed- loop decoupling techniques. Internal model control is a centralized controller derived from the desired diagonal system matrix defined taking in consideration of time-delay compensation, non-minimum phase zeros and H 2 optimal performance objective; which effectively perform both decoupling and controlling functions. In open-loop IMC decoupling, the controller is de- signed from open-loop equation of process assuming that the model is exactly matching with the process. In closed-loop IMC decoupling, only model of the system is considered and con- troller is derived from closed-loop equation of the overall system. The presence of RHP zeros is elaborately discussed in different cases like no RHP zeros, finite RHP zeros, infinite RHP and LHP zeros and infinite RHP but finite LHP zeros.

The rapid changes in proton spin create an effective heteronuclear decoupling, increasing carbon signal strength {{on account of the}} nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) and simplifying the spectrum so that each nonequivalent carbon produces a singlet peak. The relative intensities are unreliable because some carbons have a larger spin-lattice relaxation time and others have weaker NOE enhancement.|$|E
25|$|This is {{critically}} important for decoupling high-speed logic circuits from the power supply. The decoupling capacitor supplies transient current to the chip.

40|$|The chemiosmotic {{model of}} energy {{transduction}} offers a satisfying and widely confirmed {{understanding of the}} action of uncouplers on such processes as oxidative phosphorylation; the uncoupler, by facilitating the transmembrane movement of protons or other compensatory ions, reduces the electrochemical proton gradient that is posited as the energy intermediate for many kinds of bioenergetic work.
