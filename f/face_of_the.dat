If the migrating group remains on the same <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> π system, the shift is known as suprafacial, while if the migrating group transfers to the opposite face is called an antarafacial shift, which are impossible for transformations that occur within small- or medium-sized rings.|$|E

5|$|A transit of Venus {{across the}} Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes {{directly}} between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence obscuring {{a small portion}} of) the solar disk. During a transit, Venus {{can be seen from}} Earth as a small black disk moving across the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun. The duration of such transits is usually several hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes). A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of Venus is more than 3 times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more slowly across the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun, because it is much farther away from Earth.|$|E
