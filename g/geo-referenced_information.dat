40|$|The need {{to ensure}} {{environmental}} regularization of rural properties situated in the priority municipalities for deforestation control has made the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) a strategic instrument for the monitoring of alteration to Forest cover at the property scale. With the CAR, state environment agencies are able to identify areas that were deforested illegally or without authorization from the relevant agency, thus speeding up compliance of rural properties with environmental law. CAR entails the electronic register of rural properties with state environment agencies, including <b>geo-referencing</b> <b>information</b> demarcating areas destined for productive activities and other alternative uses. The advantages of the CAR for environmental management, that optimizes investments in monitoring and enforcement, speeds up legal accountability and favors integration at various levels of territorial planning, from macrozoning to the scale of each property, thus permitting landscape conservation.

40|$|A {{new way to}} {{document}} and visualize the as-built condition of an urban tunnel project with high accuracy is described in this paper, based on recent developments of laser scanning technology. In traditional surveying, the components of a tunnel are organized {{on the basis of}} the location of stations and offsets along the project alignment specified in the drawings. It is difficult for people without an engineering background to understand the information involved in surveying reports, drawings, and engineering data. However, in the interest of transparency, public agencies that commission construction projects have to make project information available to government officials and to the general public.

Laser scanning technology is introduced to perform the surveyor's task, document the as-built condition, and geo-reference the construction elements. A set of panoramic pictures is generated by laser scanning that allows for taking measurements and extracting 3 D coordinates. An XML file that contains <b>geo-reference</b> <b>information</b> is appended to each panoramic picture.

Accurate information on land and environmental resources is essential to effective land use planning. Key sources of in- formation include topographic maps, aerial photos, satellite images, and data derived from geographic information sys- tems (GIS).

40|$|In {{the last}} years we have {{witnessed}} a rapid development of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), especially for image collection. One of the advantages is the possibility to perform high resolution and repeated flights in a cheap way to detect changes over time. Thus, dynamic scenes can be monitored acquiring image blocks in different epochs in a flexible way. Anyway, most of UAVs {{are not able to}} provide accurate direct <b>geo-referencing</b> <b>information,</b> so image blocks from different epochs still need to be co-registered to efficiently detect changes. This task is mostly completed using GCPs (Ground Control Points), although this approach is time consuming as manual intervention is needed. This paper aims at investigating new techniques to automate the co-registration of image blocks without the use of GCPs, just relying on an image based co-registration (IBCR) approach. The image alignment is initially performed on a reference (anchor) epoch and the registration of the following (slave) epochs is performed including some (anchor) images from the reference epoch with fixed external orientation parameters. This allows constraining the Bundle Block Adjustment of the slave epoch to be consistent with the reference one. The study involved the use of 10 multi-temporal image block over a large building construction site, and spanning a time frame of 2 years. Different tests have been performed for the reference image choice with a manual approach and then evaluating the reached accuracy.

40|$|LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) is a multisensory system {{consisting}} of three main components: laser, GPS, and IMU units. The basic principle is to measure distances from the sensor {{to the ground}} by converting the travel time information of the laser pulses sent to the earth. A scanning mechanism, usually a scanning mirror, is used to collect the data in a strip-wise fashion. The ground coordinates of the laser footprints are derived using the direct <b>geo-referencing</b> <b>information</b> furnished by the onboard GPS/IMU unit and the calibration parameters determined through a calibration procedure. When the calibration parameters are not accurately determined, systematic discrepancies between overlapping strips might occur. The ideal solution for the adjustment of neighboring strips is the implementation of an accurate calibration procedure. However, such a calibration demands the original observations (GPS, IMU and the laser measurements), which are not usually available to the end-user. In this work, a strip adjustment procedure for reducing or eliminating discrepancies between overlapping LiDAR strips is proposed. The mathematical model employed {{is similar to that}} used in the photogrammetric Block Adjustment of Independent Models (BAIM). Generally, a traditional BAIM uses conjugate points. These features, however, are not suitable for LiDAR surfaces since {{it is almost impossible to}} identify conjugate points in overlapping LiDAR strips. In this work, the use of linear features, which are represented by sets of non-conjugate points, is investigated.

40|$|Low-cost Unmanned Airborne Vehicles (UAVs) {{are rapidly}} {{becoming}} suitable platforms for acquiring remote sensing data {{for a wide}} range of applications. For example, a UAV-based mobile mapping system (MMS) is emerging as a novel phenotyping tool that delivers several advantages to alleviate the drawbacks of conventional manual plant trait measurements. Moreover, UAVs equipped with direct geo-referenced frame cameras and pushbroom scanners can acquire geospatial data for comprehensive high-throughput phenotyping. UAVs for mobile mapping platforms are low-cost and easy to use, can fly closer to the objects, and are filling an important gap between ground wheel-based and traditional manned-airborne platforms. However, consumer-grade UAVs are capable of carrying only equipment with a relatively light payload and their flying time is determined by a limited battery life. These restrictions of UAVs unfortunately force potential users to adopt lower-quality direct geo-referencing and imaging systems that may negatively impact the quality of the deliverables. Recent advances in sensor calibration and automated triangulation have made it feasible to obtain accurate mapping using low-cost camera systems equipped with consumer-grade GNSS/INS units. However, ortho-rectification of the data from a linear-array scanner is challenging for low-cost UAV systems, because the derived geo-location information from pushbroom sensors is quite sensitive to the performance of the implemented direct geo-referencing unit. This thesis presents a novel approach for improving the ortho-rectification of hyperspectral pushbroom scanner imagery with the aid of orthophotos generated from frame cameras through the identification of conjugate features while modeling the impact of residual artifacts in the direct <b>geo-referencing</b> <b>information.</b> The experimental results qualitatively and quantitatively proved the feasibility of the proposed methodology in improving the geo-referencing accuracy of real datasets collected over an agricultural field. ...|$|R

For example, the information, which will be exchanged among entities (sensors, people, and services) of future smart cities to enhance the security and lifestyle of their citizens, poses the challenging question of how this information can be efficiently and effectively maintained across the city.

To cope with the unavoidable node failures and disconnections, our approach leverages upon randomized network coding to increase the robustness of publish/retrieval operations. Evaluation is carried out through an extensive simulation analysis for a realistic urban scenario using the metrics of efficiency in data publication/search, resource availability, and storage occupancy requirements.
