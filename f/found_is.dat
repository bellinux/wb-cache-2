5|$|A single plant {{discovered}} by Nelson near Israelite Bay, where both putative parents are <b>found,</b> <b>is</b> {{regarded as a}} hybrid between A.cuneatus and A.dobsonii. Leaves are mostly triangular like those of A.cuneatus, but whereas A.cuneatus leaves are mostly five-lobed, the putative hybrid usually has three lobes, with the occasional leaf being entire like those of A.dobsonii (though A.cuneatis itself occasionally bears entire leaves). Leaves of the putative hybrid lack the thick indumentum of A.cuneatus, being bright green with a sparse indumentum like that of A.dobsonii. Flower colour is like that of A.cuneatus but the style lacks an indumentum, like A.dobsonii.|$|E

5|$|A 2007 {{study by}} Roach and Brinkman has called into {{question}} the cooperative pack hunting behavior of Deinonychus, based on what is known of modern carnivore hunting and the taphonomy of tenontosaur sites. Modern archosaurs (birds and crocodiles) and Komodo dragons display little cooperative hunting; instead, they are usually either solitary hunters, or are drawn to previously killed carcasses, where much conflict occurs between individuals of the same species. For example, in situations where groups of Komodo dragons are eating together, the largest individuals eat first and will attack smaller Komodos that attempt to feed; if the smaller animal is killed, it is cannibalized. When this information {{is applied to the}} tenontosaur sites, it appears that what is <b>found</b> <b>is</b> consistent with Deinonychus having a Komodo or crocodile-like feeding strategy. Deinonychus skeletal remains found at these sites are from subadults, with missing parts consistent with having been eaten by other Deinonychus. On the other hand, a paper by Li et al. describes track sites with similar foot spacing and parallel trackways, implying gregarious packing behavior instead of uncoordinated feeding behavior.|$|E
5|$|Dating Lindow Man is {{problematic}} as {{samples from the}} body and surrounding peat have produced dates spanning a 900-year period. Although the peat encasing Lindow Man has been radiocarbon dated to about 300BC, Lindow Man himself has a different date. Early tests at different laboratories returned conflicting dates for the body; later tests suggested a date between 2BC and 119AD. There has been a tendency to ascribe the body to the Iron Age period rather than Roman due to the interpretation that Lindow Man's death {{may have been a}} ritual sacrifice or execution. Explanations for why the peat in which he was <b>found</b> <b>is</b> much older have been sought. Archaeologist P.C.Buckland suggests that as the stratigraphy of the peat appears undisturbed, Lindow Man may have been deposited into a pool that was already some 300years old. Geographer K.E.Barber has argued against this hypothesis, saying that pools at Lindow Moss would have been too shallow, and suggests that the peat may have been peeled back to allow the burial and then replaced, leaving the stratigraphy apparently undisturbed.|$|E

5|$|Fossil (or subfossil) black {{vultures}} cannot {{necessarily be}} attributed to the Pleistocene or the recent species without further information: the same size variation found in the living bird was also present in its larger prehistoric relative. Thus, in 1968, Hildegarde Howard separated the Mexican birds as Coragyps occidentalis mexicanus as opposed to the birds from locations farther north (such as Rancho La Brea) which constituted the nominate subspecies C. o. occidentalis. The southern birds were of the same size as present-day north black vultures and can only be distinguished by their somewhat stouter tarsometatarsus and the flatter and wider bills, and even then only with any certainty if the location where the fossils were <b>found</b> <b>is</b> known.

5|$|Group 12 metals are chalcophiles, {{meaning the}} {{elements}} have low affinities for oxides and prefer {{to bond with}} sulfides. Chalcophiles formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions of the early Earth's atmosphere. The commercially most important minerals of group 12 elements are sulfide minerals. Sphalerite, which {{is a form of}} zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60–62% zinc. No significant deposits of cadmium-containing ores are known. Greenockite (CdS), the only cadmium mineral of importance, is nearly always associated with sphalerite (ZnS). This association is caused by the geochemical similarity between zinc and cadmium which makes geological separation unlikely. As a consequence, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct from mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and, to a lesser degree, lead and copper. One place where metallic cadmium can be <b>found</b> <b>is</b> the Vilyuy River basin in Siberia. Although mercury is an extremely rare element in the Earth's crust, because it does not blend geochemically with those elements that constitute the majority of the crustal mass, mercury ores can be highly concentrated considering the element's abundance in ordinary rock. The richest mercury ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury (12,000 times average crustal abundance). It is found either as a native metal (rare) or in cinnabar (HgS), corderoite, livingstonite and other minerals, with cinnabar being the most common ore.|$|E

5|$|The {{range of}} this species {{includes}} Northern Arkansas and southern Missouri, East to the Appalachian Mountains and Ohio River Basin, North into New England, southern Ontario and Quebec. Distribution of the bats is spotty within their entire range, and they {{are considered to be}} very uncommon. These bats prefer to reside in deciduous or coniferous forests. They are active in mountain ranges from 240–1125 meters in height. During the spring, summer, and autumn they prefer to roost at emergent rock-outcrops such as cliffs, bluffs, shale barrens, and talus slopes, as well as man-made structures, including buildings, joints between segments of cement guard rails, turnpike tunnels, road-cuts, and scree covered dams. The largest populations of Myotis leibii have been found in New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Western Virginia. (red list) The total count of individuals in all hibernacula in which they have been <b>found</b> <b>is</b> 3,000, with roughly 60% of the total number from just two sites in New York. Unfortunately, 90% of their habitat is on private land which makes it difficult to protect them.|$|E

5000|$|... 500 of 600 sheep <b>were</b> <b>found</b> to <b>be</b> {{unsuitable}} {{and were}} shot. Guinea pigs <b>were</b> <b>found</b> to <b>be</b> [...] "disastrous". 234 rhesus macaques {{had to be}} treated for pneumonia before being used.|$|R
30|$|In {{the second}} and third year after the restorations were emplaced, the median CBD values for the CG <b>were</b> <b>found</b> to <b>be</b> a little smaller than for the IM group. And for the last control period, this {{observation}} <b>was</b> <b>found</b> to <b>be</b> inverted meaning the median CBD values for the IM group <b>were</b> <b>found</b> to <b>be</b> smaller than the ones for the CG (Fig.  9).|$|R
30|$|The {{minimum limit}} given by BS 5950 on S/D o is 1.08 which <b>was</b> <b>found</b> to <b>be</b> critical. The S/D o ratios of 1.33 and 1.5 <b>were</b> <b>found</b> to <b>be</b> very effective. S/D o ratio of 3 <b>was</b> <b>found</b> to <b>be</b> very conservative, if the {{openings}} are provided as per this ratio; {{the response of}} beam is almost {{similar to that of}} plain-webbed beam.|$|R
