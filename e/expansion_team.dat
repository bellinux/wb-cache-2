5|$|The {{potential}} to draw an MLS <b>expansion</b> <b>team</b> helped drive {{public support for}} building the stadium in 1997.

5|$|Even {{before the}} first cities in the United States were chosen to host Major League Soccer teams, Seattle was {{considered}} a viable location for a professional team. In 1994, as the U.S. was preparing to host the FIFA World Cup, more than 30 cities were pursuing the rights to an MLS team, Seattle being among them. However, despite the strong soccer fan base in Seattle, {{the absence of a}} soccer-only stadium was a drawback to establishing an MLS team. Cities seeking consideration for an inaugural MLS team were also expected to secure 10,000 assurances from fans for season tickets. By the June 3, 1994 deadline for MLS team bids, Seattle organizers had secured fewer than 1,500 such assurances. These low numbers were a result of competition between the ticket campaign for the MLS <b>expansion</b> <b>team</b> and for the American Professional Soccer League (APSL) Sounders <b>expansion</b> <b>team.</b>|$|E
