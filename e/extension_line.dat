5|$|From 1906, {{some of the}} Ashbury bogie {{stock was}} {{converted}} into electric multiple units. Some Dreadnought carriages were used with electric motor cars, although two-thirds remained in use as locomotive hauled stock on the <b>extension</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|From 1891, more {{locomotives}} {{were needed}} {{for work on}} the <b>extension</b> <b>line</b> from Baker Street into the country. Four C Class (0-4-4) locomotives, a development of South Eastern Railway's 'Q' Class, were received in 1891. In 1894, two D Class locomotives were bought to run between Aylesbury and Verney Junction. These were not fitted with the condensing equipment needed to work south of Finchley Road. Four more were delivered in 1895 with condensing equipment, although these were prohibited working south of Finchley Road. In 1896, two E Class (0-4-4) locomotives were built at Neasden works, followed by one in 1898 to replace the original Class A No. 1, damaged in an accident. Four more were built by Hawthorn Leslie & Co in 1900 and 1901. To cope with the growing freight traffic on the <b>extension</b> <b>line,</b> the Met received four F Class (0-6-2) locomotives in 1901, similar to the E Class except for the wheel arrangement and without steam heat. In 1897 and 1899, the Met received two 0-6-0 saddle tank locomotives to a standard Peckett design. Unclassified by the Met, these were generally used for shunting at Neasden and Harrow.|$|E
5|$|Until 1880 the Met ran no goods trains, but goods trains {{ran over}} its tracks from 20 February 1866 when the GNR began {{a service to}} the LC via Farringdon Street, {{followed}} by a service from the Midland Railway from July 1868. The GNR, the GWR and the Midland all opened goods depots in the Farringdon area, accessed from the City Widened Lines. Goods traffic was {{to play an important}} part of Met traffic on the <b>extension</b> <b>line</b> out of Baker Street. In 1880, the Met secured the coal traffic of the Harrow District Gas Co., worked from an exchange siding with the Midland at Finchley Road to a coal yard at Harrow. Goods and coal depots were provided at most of the stations on the <b>extension</b> <b>line</b> as they were built. Goods for London were initially handled at Willesden, with delivery by road or by transfer to the Midland. The arrival of the GCR gave connections to the north at Quainton Road and south via Neasden, Acton and Kew.|$|E

5|$|Competition {{with the}} GCR on outer {{suburban}} services on the <b>extension</b> <b>line</b> saw {{the introduction of}} more comfortable Dreadnought Stock carriages from 1910. Ninety-two of these wooden compartment carriages were built, fitted with pressurised gas lighting and steam heating. Electric lighting had replaced the gas by 1917 and electric heaters were added in 1922 to provide warmth when hauled by an electric locomotive. Later formed into rakes of five, six or seven coaches, conductor rail pick-ups on the leading and trailing guard coaches were joined by a bus line and connected to the electric locomotive to help prevent gapping. Two rakes were formed with a Pullman coach that provided a buffet service for a supplementary fare. The Vintage Carriages Trust has three preserved Dreadnought carriages.|$|E
5|$|There {{remained}} a bottleneck at Finchley Road where the fast and slow tracks converged into one pair {{for the original}} M tunnels to Baker Street. In 1925, a plan was developed for two new tube tunnels, large enough for the Met rolling stock that would join the <b>extension</b> <b>line</b> at a junction north of Kilburn & Brondesbury station and run beneath Kilburn High Street, Maida Vale and Edgware Road to Baker Street. The plan included three new stations, at Quex Road, Kilburn Park Road and Clifton Road, but did not progress after Ministry of Transport revised its Requirements for Passenger Lines requiring a means of exit in an emergency {{at the ends of}} trains running in deep-level tubes – compartment stock used north of Harrow did not comply with this requirement. Edgware Road station had been rebuilt with four platforms and had train destination indicators including stations such as Verney Junction and Uxbridge.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the more}} {{difficult}} tasks {{during the course of}} the construction was a rock excavation work costing S$1.5 million along Woodlands Avenue 3, in which explosives were used to make way for the train viaduct. Another difficult project was the levelling of land covered in thick vegetation in Kadut, Woodlands and Sembawang. The laying of a 22-metre long concrete beam weighing 165 tonnes in October 1994 marked the completion of the structural link between the existing MRT network and the Woodlands <b>extension</b> <b>line.</b> The entire Woodlands <b>extension</b> <b>line</b> consists of around 1,163 beams. The tracks were then laid, followed by the installation of the electrical and mechanical systems and equipment. A real-time information system, costing S$400,000, was first introduced on the Woodlands MRT line. It provides passengers with train arrival times and informs them if trains are late or disrupted. The information is displayed on electronic boards installed at the entrance of each station.|$|E
25|$|Better {{news was}} the {{excellent}} {{returns from the}} coal traffic over the Derbyshire <b>extension</b> <b>line.</b> To consolidate this, in the 1880 session the GNR introduced a bill for a branch from Bulwell to Newstead, and this opened for coal traffic in July 1881 and for passengers on 2 October 1882. In 1881 the GNR bought out the Stafford & Uttoxeter Railway, reached from the Derbyshire extension by running powers over the North Staffordshire Railway.|$|E
500|$|In 1870, some {{close-coupled}} rigid-wheelbase four-wheeled carriages {{were built}} by Oldbury. After some derailments in 1887, a new design of [...] long rigid-wheelbase four-wheelers known as Jubilee Stock {{was built by}} the Cravens Railway Carriage and Wagon Co. for the <b>extension</b> <b>line.</b> With the pressurised gas lighting system and non-automatic vacuum brakes from new, steam heating was added later. More trains followed in 1892, although all had been withdrawn by 1912. By May 1893, following an order by the Board of Trade, automatic vacuum brakes had been fitted to all carriages and locomotives. A Jubilee Stock first class carriage was restored to carry passengers during the Met's 150th anniversary celebrations.|$|E
40|$|MBA - WBSMany {{prominent}} brands wane {{at the end}} {{of their}} brand life cycle. This research report analysed this phenomenon and whether an upscale <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> could assist to revitalise a stale brand. Research in beverages found that a <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> allows an established brand to venture into new territories with less risk than repositioning itself altogether. The <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> is akin to a tugboat that steers a ship in a desired direction. The research revealed some reciprocation where a <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> adds brand differentiation. Findings included four possible functions for a <b>line</b> <b>extension.</b> In addition, some parameters in crafting a <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> were firstly, the core brand remained the driver; secondly, brand-fit in the market opportunity, the functional and emotional benefits and lastly, entry entrant launch timing is optimal.

50|$|Trunk {{lines are}} used for {{connecting}} a private branch exchange (PBX) to a telephone service provider.

500|$|The term Metro-land {{was coined}} by the Met's {{marketing}} department in 1915 when the Guide to the <b>Extension</b> <b>Line</b> became the Metro-land guide, priced at 1d. This promoted the land {{served by the}} Met for the walker, visitor and later the house-hunter. Published annually until 1932, the last full year of independence, the guide extolled the benefits of [...] "The good air of the Chilterns", using language such as [...] "Each lover of Metroland may well have his own favourite wood beech and coppice— all tremulous green loveliness in Spring and russet and gold in October". The dream promoted was of a modern home in beautiful countryside with a fast railway service to central London.|$|E
500|$|Local {{solutions}} – such as {{the proposed}} Metro <b>extension</b> <b>line</b> and the road connecting La Lagunita and Macaracuay – may improve the traffic congestion around El Hatillo, but the traffic issue affects all of Caracas. It is estimated that one million vehicles transit Caracas daily, causing a collapse of the transportation network. [...] Automobiles travel at an average speed of 15km/h (9mph) {{on the streets and}} highways of Caracas. [...] There are numerous factors contributing to the traffic problem in Caracas. According to the Venezuelan Society of Transportation Engineers, a city should allocate 20% of its public area to transportation; in Caracas, less than 12% is allocated. In 2004, fifty thousand new vehicles were sold in Caracas. In 2005, sixty thousand more were sold, and as of November, 2006, seventy thousand more had been sold. In five years, 250 thousand more cars are circulating in Caracas on roadways that have not increased proportionally to {{the increase in the number}} of cars. [...] Further, public transportation is not fully reliable; an average trip in the city using mass transit takes around ninety minutes.|$|E
500|$|In 1925, {{a branch}} opened from Rickmansworth to Watford. Although {{there had been}} a railway station in Watford since 1837, in 1895 the Watford Tradesmen's Association had {{approached}} the Met with a proposal for a line to Watford via Stanmore. They approached again in 1904, this time jointly with the local District Council, to discuss a new plan for a shorter branch from Rickmansworth. A possible route was surveyed in 1906 and a bill deposited in 1912 seeking authority for a joint Met & GCR line from Rickmansworth to Watford town centre that would cross Cassiobury Park on an embankment. There was local opposition to the embankment and the line was cut back to a station with goods facilities just short of the park. The amended Act was passed on 7 August 1912 and the Watford Joint Committee formed before the start of World War I in 1914 delayed construction. After the war, the 1921 Trade Facilities Act offered government financial guarantees for capital projects that promoted employment, and taking advantage of this construction started in 1922. During construction the Railways Act 1921 meant that in 1923 the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) replaced the GCR. Where the branch met the <b>extension</b> <b>line</b> two junctions were built, allowing trains access to Rickmansworth and London. Services started on 3 November 1925 with one intermediate station at Croxley Green (now Croxley), with services provided by Met electric multiple units to Liverpool Street via Moor Park and Baker Street and by LNER steam trains to Marylebone. The Met also ran a shuttle service between Watford and Rickmansworth. During 1924–5 the flat junction north of Harrow was replaced with a [...] long diveunder to separate Uxbridge and main-line trains. Another attempt was made in 1927 to extend the Watford branch across Cassiobury Park to the town centre, the Met purchasing a property on Watford High Street with the intention of converting it to a station. The proposals for tunnelling under the park proved controversial and the scheme was dropped.|$|E
