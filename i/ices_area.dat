This is the first detailed account of the biology of plaice {{for some of these}} areas. It is intended that this study will improve understanding of the life cycle of plaice and help fisheries scientists to better predict the effect of fishing effort on Irish plaice stocks. The overall length range found for plaice was 9 - 51. 99 cm TL, with a length range of 9 - 5 lcm TL for females and 9 - 40 cm for males. In all ICES areas the length range for female fish was larger than for male fish. The age range of plaice sampled during this study was 1 to 16 years. In all ICES areas females had a greater range in ages and fish in the larger age groups. From analysis of length and age data it was concluded that {{there was a significant difference}} (P= 0. 000) in growth rate of males and females between ICES areas sampled in March 2004.

40|$|Global {{warming is}} one of the most serious {{problems}} the earth is facing in the 21 st Century. In order to detect the sign of global warming, the importance of sea ice monitoring is increasing. Especially, sea ice thickness is an key parameter for understanding the heat flux of sea <b>ice</b> <b>area.</b> However, estimation of sea ice thickness with satellite remote sensing is not easy. In this study authors have examined the possibility of extracting thin sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> from remotely sensed data from space. The study was performed in the Sea of Okhotsk. Firstly, the possibility of estimating thin ice thickness with high resolution optical sensor RSI(IFOV = 8 m) on FORMOSAT- 2 satellite was examined. The comparison of RSI data with in situ measurement of ice thickness suggested the possibility of estimating sea ice thickness with RSI data for less than 20 cm under the cloudless and snow free condition. The correlation between RSI data and MODIS data(IFOV = 250 m) was also examined for the thin <b>ice</b> <b>area.</b> The result also suggested the possibility of extracting thin sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> from MODIS data. Based on these results, the authors have examined possibility of extracting thin sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> with passive microwave sensor AMSR-E by using thin <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> estimated with MODIS data as truth data. Since the horizontal polarization of 19 GHz are more sensitive to water than the vertical polarization of 19 GHz, the authors have utilized the polarization difference of 19 GHz for extracting thin sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> from AMSR-E data.

40|$|The {{variation}} in the Arctic sea ice {{is dominated by the}} seasonal cycle with little inter-annual correlation. Though the mean sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> has decreased steadily in the period of satellite observations, a dramatic transition in the dynamics was initiated with the record low September <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> in 2007. The change is much more pronounced in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle than in the annual mean <b>ice</b> <b>area.</b> The shape of the seasonal cycle is surprisingly constant for the whole observational record despite the general decline. A simple explanation, independent of the increased greenhouse warming, for the shape of the seasonal cycle is offered. Thus the dramatic climate change in arctic <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> is seen in the amplitude of the cycle and to a lesser extend the annual mean and the summer ice extend. The reason why the climate change is most pronounced in the amplitude is related to the rapid reduction in perennial ice and thus a thinning of the ice.

Although it changed its name {{from time to time}} it has always been the northern Spanish acoustic research survey. Its main aim is the assessment of pelagic resources by acoustics tools across the northwest and northern Spanish waters. This survey is mainly targeted at sardine, although other pelagic resources are also taken into account, such as horse mackerel, mackerel and anchovy. The sampling area comprises the northern part of Portugal (<b>ICES</b> <b>area</b> IXa Central North), in the vicinity of Porto and extends to the southern Atlantic French waters (<b>ICES</b> <b>area</b> VIIIb), in the vicinity of Arcachon. Depths are from 30 to 200 m. The acoustic device is an echosounder EK- 500, working at frequencies of 12, 38 and 120 KHz. This echosounder was replaced in 2005 by a new echosounder EK- 60, working at frequencies of 18, 38, 70 and 120 KHz. Fish samples were collected by a pelagic trawling gear, with 24 m of vertical opening. An auxiliary purse-seiner is also chartered to help in shoal identification in coastal waters. This fishery boat is mainly used when the research vessel cannot fish because of the bathymetry, particularly in the Rias Bajas area, in Galicia. The presence of anchovy was rather occasional in PELACUS and no assessment is routinely produced because of the poor presence of this species on fishing samples as well as echograms. Also it has to be considered that this survey is mostly targeted to sardine and both ICES WGMHSA Report 2006 611 the distribution area and the main season of abundance of anchovy are not totally covered by this survey. Hence the research surveys PELACUS are considered NOT GOOD INDICATORS on anchovy distribution and abundance and conclusions regarding anchovy from this survey should be taken with caution...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Due to {{the global}} warming, {{importance}} of monitoring sea ice distribution is increasing. Ice thickness {{is one of the}} most important parameters of sea ice. In thin <b>ice</b> <b>areas,</b> the heat flux of ice is strongly affected by the ice thickness difference. Thus, the extraction of thin <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> is quite important from global warming monitoring point of view. In 2014, the authors have developed an algorithm to detect thin <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> in the Sea of Okhotsk using the brightness temperature data derived from the passive microwave radiometer AMSR 2 on board GCOM-W 1 satellite. The basic algorithm is to use the brightness temperature scatter plots of AMSR 2 19 GHz polarization difference (V–H) vs 19 GHz V polarization. In this study, we have investigated the possibility of applying the thin ice algorithm to the Bering Sea. Since the Bering Sea is located in higher latitude than the Okhotsk Sea, some parameter tuning of the algorithm was expected. The authors have examined the parameter of the algorithm and have verified the result by overlaying the extracted thin <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> on simultaneously observed MODIS images taken under the cloudless weather condition.

40|$|AbstractThe Svalbard {{archipelago}} in the High Arctic {{is influenced}} by cold Arctic water masses from the north-east and the warm West Spitsbergen Current flowing northwards along its western coast. The eastern waters and the fjords are normally frozen during the winter months, while the coastal waters west of the archipelago remain open. Norwegian fishers have been harvesting from Svalbard waters for decades and detailed records of catches exists from 1980 onwards. We analyze the catch records from the Svalbard zone (approximately <b>ICES</b> <b>area</b> IIb). The large fishery for capelin in summer yielding annual catches up to 737   000 tons was closed by a Norwegian fishery regulation in the mid nineteen nineties. Demersal fisheries have been continuous, and the results clearly indicate a northward trend in landings of Northeast Arctic cod, haddock, ling and Atlantic halibut. Fisheries of Northern shrimp have been more variable and shown no clear geographic trends. A “gold rush” fishery for scallops north of Svalbard lasted for about 10 years (1986 – 1995) only, and ended due to low profitably. These results are discussed {{in relation to the}} possibility of further northward extension of fisheries subjected to climate change...|$|E
40|$|The {{extent of}} open water area {{in spring and}} time of rapid {{retreat of the sea}} <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> in late spring are {{important}} characteristics of the sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> in the Antarctic. The present study investigates relationships between atmospheric conditions and open water extent. In the present study, the position and intensity of the circumpolar trough are used as a measure of atmospheric conditions over the sea <b>ice</b> <b>area.</b> When the circumpolar trough is intense, it tends to be located at higher latitudes along the Antarctic coast. In such cases, the open water in spring increases and the time of significant retreat of the sea ice edge in late spring tends to be delayed...|$|R

40|$|From 2002 through 2008 {{the secular}} rate of de-creasing sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> in the {{northern}} hemisphere accelerated {{by a factor of}} 18, whereas the secular rate of increasing sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> in the southern hemisphere accelerated by a factor of 16, relative to the rates from 1978 through 2007. These were derived from the daily sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> retrieved from the Scanning Multi-channel Microwave Radiometer – Special Sensor Microwave/Imager and the Advanced Microwave Scan- ning Radiometer for the Earth Observation Sys- tem. The “annual” cycle of northern and southern sea <b>ice</b> <b>areas,</b> the number of days between maxima and minima is 372. 4, on average, a frequency modulation, with a recurrence interval of 61. 7 years. Significant spectral power occurs at the quasi- 4 -day through 120 -day frequencies. The frequency content and modulation of the daily time series’ are consistent inter-monthly to inter-seasonal frequencies of solar irradiance, atmospheric-oceanic Rossby waves, length-of- day, and polar motion. This suggests conserva-tion of angular momentum of the atmosphere – sea-ice – ocean system. The near 60 -year modu- lation and analysis of the detrended daily time series of the Arctic and Antarctic sea <b>ice</b> <b>areas</b> suggest the accelerations shown by the secular trends are relatively short-lived and reversible within an interval of one-quarter (15 -years) to one-half (30 -years) of the modulation period...|$|R
