5|$|This module {{starts in}} one of two ways. If the players have {{finished}} Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, they have been transported to the glacial rift via the magic chain. They will know that they are searching for some force behind the giant alliance. If the players are starting with Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, then they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hired</b> by nobles to destroy the frost giants. Either way, a safe, hidden cave is easily found for a base of operations.|$|E
5|$|The Turnpike Commission {{announced}} plans to consider eliminating manned toll booths in favor of all-electronic tolls. With this, tolls will be paid using either E-ZPass or credit cards. Drivers unable to pay by either of these methods will be billed in the mail using license plate recognition; an additional surcharge will be applied. In addition to E-ZPass, the turnpike commission offered other automated options to pay for tolls such as using a prepaid account that utilizes license plate recognition. McCormick Taylor and Wilbur Smith Associates <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hired</b> to conduct a feasibility study on converting the road to all-electronic tolls.|$|E
5|$|The turnpike {{commission}} {{announced plans}} to consider eliminating manned toll booths in favor of all-electronic tolls. With this system, tolls will be paid with E-ZPass or credit cards. Drivers unable to pay by either method will be billed by mail (using license plate recognition), and a surcharge will be imposed. In addition to E-ZPass, the turnpike commission offered other automated options to pay for tolls such as using a prepaid account that utilizes license plate recognition. McCormick Taylor and Wilbur Smith Associates <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hired</b> to conduct a feasibility study on converting the road to all-electronic tolls. On March 6, 2012, the turnpike commission {{announced that it was}} implementing an all-electronic tolling plan. The turnpike commission will save $65million annually on labor costs by eliminating toll collectors. Plans call for a 76-percent surcharge on motorists without E-ZPass who are billed by mail; this surcharge could raise the toll for a motorist without E-ZPass to well over $50 to travel the entire turnpike. On January 3, 2016, all-electronic tolling was introduced in the westbound direction at the Delaware River Bridge mainline toll plaza, while the eastern terminus of the ticket system was moved from the Delaware River Bridge to Neshaminy Falls.|$|E

25|$|Airport {{officials}} and city leaders say {{the merger of}} MCI's three terminals into one terminal is inevitable.

The study took three years {{and according to the}} authority, nine consulting organisations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hired</b> for the research, observation, planning and advice.

25|$|Besides {{the priest}} and knight there is another special {{position}} in the order, singled out for its involvement in {{the election of the}} master: the servitor, who was subordinate to the regular brother. The servitors were not allowed to fighting among themselves, to refuse work, or {{to spend the night in}} town without permission.

They were under the direction of the brethren, but performed the majority of menial tasks.|$|E

Blizzard itself has not yet commented upon the large Overwatch porn scene. After one creator posted a screenshot of one such takedown notice on a Reddit message board, other creators started to come together in order to pressure Blizzard to stop.|$|E
25|$|On 8 October 2001, a UNOMIG {{helicopter}} {{was shot down}} in Georgia in Kodori Valley gorge near Abkhazia, amid fighting between Chechens and Abkhazians, killing nine including five UN observers. Georgia denied having troops in the area, and the suspicion fell on the armed group headed by Chechen warlord Ruslan Gelayev, who was speculated to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hired</b> by the Georgian government to wage proxy war against separatist Abkhazia. On 2 March 2004, following a number of cross-border raids from Georgia into Chechnya, Ingushetia, and Dagestan, Gelayev {{was killed in a}} clash with Russian border guards while trying to get back from Dagestan into Georgia.|$|E

The riches of Tolosa were shipped back to Rome, but only the silver made it: the gold was stolen by a band of marauders, who were believed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hired</b> by Caepio himself and to have killed the legion guarding it. The Gold of Tolosa was never found, and was said to have been passed {{all the way down to}} the last heir of the Servilii Caepiones, Marcus Junius Brutus.|$|E

500|$|Church {{interpretation}} of the seventh commandment teaches that business owners should balance a desire for profits that will ensure {{the future of the}} business with a responsibility toward the [...] "good of persons". Business owners are required to pay their workers a reasonable wage, honor contracts, and abstain from dishonest activity, including bribery of government officials. Workers are required to do their jobs conscientiously, as they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hired</b> to do them, and to avoid dishonesty in the workplace, such as using office goods for personal use without permission (embezzlement).|$|E
500|$|Finally, James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell) learns he may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hired</b> as {{a writer}} on TGS with Tracy Jordan because of affirmative action and quits. Liz—the show's head writer—is {{reluctant}} to rehire him until TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) reveals to Liz that {{she is also a}} beneficiary of affirmative action, having attended college on a Title IX scholarship and having her project The Glrlie Show picked up as a mid-season replacement for a misogynistic show that received complaints. When Toofer returns, he demands that no one call him [...] "Toofer" [...] anymore, but when everyone comes up with more insulting nicknames, he gives up.|$|E

He was also the youngest coach to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hired</b> by the school. In addition to coaching, he was instrumental in the recruiting of top African-American players to play football at Alabama. One player whom Mitchell helped recruit was Ozzie Newsome, who went on to have a Hall of Fame career.|$|E
500|$|Newton met Holmes {{early in}} October 1975 when, the former claimed, {{he was given}} {{a down payment on a}} fee of £10,000. Holmes later denied any such transaction, admitting only an {{agreement}} that Newton would carry out a frightening operation. On 12 October Newton, calling himself [...] "Peter Keene", drove to Barnstaple in a yellow Mazda car where he approached Scott, claiming to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hired</b> to protect Scott from a supposed Canadian hit man. This seemed plausible to Scott, who had been beaten up a few weeks earlier, and he agreed to meet [...] "Keene" [...] at a later date. However, he was sufficiently cautious to ask a friend to make a note of the stranger's car registration number.|$|E

Unlike the two previous modules where the giant's complex consists of two levels, the fire giant hall contains three levels. [...] The giants live in a hot, smoky barren area made of rock; as in the previous module, the party is able to find a safe location for forays against the giants. [...] The leader of the fire giants is King Snurre Iron Belly, and his hall is made of obsidian and natural caverns.|$|E
