25|$|Secondary flight {{controls}} include the rotor transmission clutch, {{also known as}} a pre-rotator, which when engaged drives the rotor to start it spinning before takeoff, and collective pitch to reduce blade pitch before driving the rotor. Collective pitch controls are not usually fitted to autogyros, but {{can be found on the}} Air & Space 18A and McCulloch J-2 and the Westermayr Tragschrauber and are capable of near VTOL performance. Unlike a helicopter, autogyros without collective pitch or another jump start facility need a runway to take off; however, they are capable of landing with a very short or zero <b>ground</b> <b>roll.</b> Like helicopters, each autogyro has a specific height–velocity diagram for safest operation, although the dangerous area is usually smaller than for helicopters.|$|E

2500|$|Introduced at Sun 'n Fun 2013, the CH-750 Cruzer uses a new wing {{without the}} leading-edge slats of the STOL CH 750, and a newly {{designed}} tail {{with a separate}} vertical fin and rudder, rather than the all-flying rudder of the STOL version. The model is optimized for cross-country speed rather than STOL capabilities, although the specified 350 ft (107 m) <b>ground</b> <b>roll</b> of the Cruzer qualifies as STOL by most definitions.

Even with the spoilers out and landing gear extended, the plane had a very low sink rate and pilots resorted to holding the RB-57Ds into a series of slight stalls to get the aircraft down to the runway.|$|E

40|$|Polymers such as polyethylene, {{polypropylene}} and polystyrene {{are very}} inert and have quite low surface energies. Therefore {{it is necessary}} to treat the surfaces of these polymers prior to processes such as printing or bonding [1]. Corona and flame treatments are commonly used in the industry to improve bondability and printability of polyolefin films and large-size objects because of the speed and ease of processing. The set-up for such an operation is very simple and cost-effective. A corona treatment system consists of an electrode connected to a high-voltage source and a <b>grounded</b> <b>roll</b> as shown in Figure 1. The <b>grounded</b> <b>roll</b> is usually covered with an insulating material such as polyester, ceramic, epoxy or silicon rubber. The corona occurs when a high voltage is applied across the electrodes to cause ionization of air. A plasma is formed and a light blue color can be observed in the air gap. This atmospheric pressure plasma is called a corona discharge. The insulating material, which covers the <b>grounded</b> <b>roll,</b> prevents a direct arc between the two electrodes. However, the roll covering material is subjected to damage due to heat and the corona. One of the solutions to this problem is resolved by using a quartz tube filled with irregularly shaped metal pellets as the electrode. Quartz, being impervious to damage by heat or corona, is a good material for this application. To control the environment in which the corona is generated, the corona equipment can be placed in a chamber that is continuously flushed with dried or humidified air...|$|R

50|$|A roll is {{the most}} basic and {{fundamental}} skill in gymnastics. There are many variations in the skill.

50|$|The {{failure of}} the first officer to push the correct button to engage the autothrottles at the {{beginning}} of the takeoff roll.

50|$|The {{asymmetric}} blade {{effect is}} dependent on thrust, and is proportional to forward velocity (specifically CAS) and, while generally insignificant during the initial <b>ground</b> <b>roll</b> for tail-wheel aircraft, will give a pronounced nose-left tendency during the later stages of the <b>ground</b> <b>roll,</b> particularly if the thrust axis is kept inclined to the flight path vector (i.e. tail-wheel in contact with runway). If a high angle of attack is used during the rotation (or indeed {{straight and level flight}} with high power and high angle of attack), then the effect can also be apparent. The effect is not so apparent during the landing, flare and rollout, given the relatively low power setting (propeller RPM). However, should the throttle be suddenly advanced with the tail-wheel in contact with the runway, then anticipation of this nose-left tendency is prudent.|$|E
