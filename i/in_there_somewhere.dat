5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>somewhere...</b> but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, the {{character}} underwent changes in appearance and direction with Becky suffering two miscarriages. Kelly branded the storyline challenging, admitting {{she felt a}} huge responsibility to get it right, stating: [...] "It's definitely been the hardest thing I've done since I've been here. I think the responsibility to do it well that you feel is huge." [...] Kelly also spoke of the sadness she felt for the impact the plot has on her character adding: [...] "She can't really put up any barriers about this– it's the worst thing that's ever happened. She goes from being a girl to a woman, I think. I'm just devastated for her". Kelly brands the storyline as her hardest, [...] "Most of Becky’s storylines have an element of fun <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>somewhere,</b> but with this one {{it was just like}} a cloud was hanging over me for six weeks." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{originally}} {{had a different}} ending to the one later released in America under the title Shades of Fear. Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein requested that the ending be reworked prior to distribution, and Winterson was highly unhappy at being asked to write an additional conclusionary scene. Winterson's preferred ending sees Rex Goodyear burn the painting he believes to be fraudulent, only to discover he actually had the genuine item in his possession all along, and has now destroyed it. This ties in with the major theme of the film in Winterson's eyes, whereby [...] "Duncan, Gabriel, Miss Bead and Miss Quim all find something valuable where they least expected it, Rex Goodyear finds that the things we value are very often worthless." [...] Winterson has called Weinstein [...] "a bully who knows the gentle touch", referring to the new ending as [...] "the most expensive words I will ever write". While she believes that the new ending is satisfying, she feels the film has lost some dimensions which were important to her and concludes: [...] "It is a good movie {{but it is not}} the movie I thought we could make. [...] I do like Great Moments but there is another film <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>somewhere</b> that has got lost." ...|$|E
40|$|Simon J. Ortiz {{explains}} that {{the title of his}} 2002 collection of poetry, Out <b>There</b> <b>Somewhere,</b> is intended to mean “out <b>there</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> everyday experience somewhere in America” (ix). He adds, “But while I have physically been away from my home area, I have never been away in any absolute way” (ix). The poems <b>in</b> Out <b>There</b> <b>Somewhere</b> attest to the cultural connections that Ortiz maintains even though he might be in some location other than the Acoma Pueblo. The resistance one finds in the poems—against mainstream political, social, and economic forces—results in continuance of Ortiz’s Acoma heritage. That natives can still be natives when they are away from their tribal homelands speaks to those who are urban natives, which is over two-thirds of the native population in the United States: those natives who have left the reservation for economic reasons; those native tribes who have no land base; those natives who have no federal recognition as official native tribes; and those natives who for reasons of patrilineal or matrilineal descent have no tribal affiliation. Although they are “out there somewhere,” they continue to be native, as Ortiz so deftly demonstrates. A political thread runs through Ortiz’s earlier poetry collections, and this essay looks at a few of the poems <b>in</b> Out <b>There</b> <b>Somewhere</b> to see how this literature of resistance continues through cultural connections...|$|R

500|$|New York Post critic Ryan Brockington {{liked the}} song, but {{questioned}} Gaga's emulation of M.I.A. Mosi Reeves from Spin criticized Gaga's [...] "wanna-be-M.I.A. cadences", calling it [...] "unnecessarily crass". Another review from Spin by Brandon Soderberg panned the song, saying that [...] "t wasn't a Wale song and it wasn't a Gaga song with Wale wedged <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>somewhere,</b> either. 'Chillin' became {{something of an}} Internet rap watershed moment". Sean Fennessey from Pitchfork Media described the song as [...] "much-maligned", adding that [...] "there won't be much to gain from ... This {{was the first step}} in Wale's multiple personality debacle and he seems to know as much—nothing else on Attention Deficit resembles the goofy sneakers-shouting writing here." [...] In another review, Ryan Dombal from the same website criticized Wale's repetition of his name and the usage of the samples calling it [...] "unnecessary". [...] Brian Howe from Paste described the track as [...] "flashy and hollow". The Greyhound gave the song a negative review and believed that [...] "with a lackluster hook and the repetition of the name 'Wale,' the airplay and sales of this single will depend greatly upon the vocals of Lady Gaga." [...] Wilson McBee from Slant Magazine criticized both [...] "Chillin" [...] and the follow-up single, [...] "World Tour", as [...] "tepid Cool & Dre productions in which Wale seems to be attempting Black Eyed Peas-style halftime-show rap." [...] McBee believed that the songs did not represent {{the true nature of the}} album. Prefix magazine was also critical of the song saying that [...] "just when you think Wale understands the consequences of mindlessly horny partying... he gives us the dumb, cheaply agreeable Lady Gaga feature 'Chillin'." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 5, 2012, Pikmin 3 {{was shown}} at Nintendo's press conference at E3. It {{demonstrated}} {{some of the}} new gameplay aspects including the new rock Pikmin and the GamePad controls. It was said that it would be released around {{the same time as the}} Wii U, but its release was later delayed until mid-2013. When questioned about the presence or absence of the purple and white Pikmin types featured in the second game, Miyamoto stated that [...] "They're <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>somewhere,</b> just hidden...". A video released from Nintendo Direct confirmed that they would in fact be in the game, but only in the game's Mission Mode and Bingo Battle.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Tomasky {{reviewed}} {{the work for}} The New York Review of Books, and echoed the assessment by On the Issues, it was a political tool for Trump's 2012 presidential aspirations. Tomasky observed, the genre of the work was placed within marketing himself and conservative ideology. He pointed out Trump used Regnery Publishing, a conservative book outlet. Tomasky wrote Trump's domestic policy proposals were boring. Stephan Lee, in a review for Entertainment Weekly, wrote that the book, [...] "reads like a 190-page diatribe against the Obama presidency, illegal immigration, and the people and media outlets who have dared to criticize him." [...] Carlos Lozada, nonfiction book critic for The Washington Post, pointed out the timing and purpose of the book. Lozada highlighted the contradictory nature of Trump's harsh criticism {{on the campaign trail}} for The New York Times, while simultaneously touting the book as a New York Times Best Seller on its cover. The Washington Post noted the name change of the book, writing, the 2011 version did not sync with his 2016 new political identity. Lozada wrote of the book's reissue with repackaging, i.e., minimal changes to content and significant changes to its exterior, that was a fitting [...] "metaphor <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>somewhere</b> for the campaign of a real-estate developer." ...|$|E

Still, people just make the assumption that were five guys whove just got our dicks in mind.

6000|$|But {{whatever}} {{the meaning of}} Hukweem's crying, it seems to constitute {{a large part of}} his existence. Indeed, it is as a cry that he is chiefly known--the wild, unearthly cry of the wilderness night. His education for this begins very early. Once I was exploring the grassy shores of a wild lake when a mother loon appeared suddenly, out in the middle, with a great splashing and crying. I paddled out to see what was the matter. She withdrew with a great effort, apparently, as I approached, still crying loudly and beating the water with her wings. [...] "Oho," [...] I said, [...] "you have a nest <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>somewhere,</b> and now you are trying to get me away from it." [...] This was the only time I have ever known a loon to try that old mother bird's trick. Generally they slip off the nest while the canoe is yet half a mile away, and swim under water a long distance, and watch you silently {{from the other side of}} the lake.|$|E
