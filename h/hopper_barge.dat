50|$|The {{company was}} {{acquired}} by Canada Steamship Lines Limited in 1946. It continued to build ships, including three coasters, two of which were delivered to Chinese government, and six <b>hopper</b> <b>barges</b> for the French government. Major constructions ceased after 1959, though the company continued to repair and renovate ships. The company became a subsidiary of Canadian Shipbuilding and Engineering Limited in 1987 and closed in 1993.

During World War II, Walkers constructed two River class frigates, a Bay class frigate and seven Bathurst class corvettes, {{in addition to other}} smaller vessels. Post war naval contracts included seven Attack class patrol boats in the late 1960s and eight Balikpapan class landing craft heavy in the early 1970s. After the completion of the latter, Walker's Maryborough shipyard closed in 1974.|$|R
50|$|To {{supplement}} the ships {{of the permanent}} force a number of government vessels were modified so as to serve as gunboats or torpedo boats. The <b>hopper</b> <b>barges</b> Batman and Fawkner were modified so as to mount a six-inch breech-loading gun at the bow of each ship. Two machine guns were also fitted. Strengthening of the bow, the fitting of a magazine, shell room, crew quarters and some armour protection for the crew added two more gunboats to the fleet. A compressor fitted to Fawkner meant that the torpedo boats could be serviced at sea. The tug boat Gannet and steamer Lady Loch were likewise modified.|$|R

All the tugs were either scrapped or had diesel engines installed, except Mayflower, as she was too old to be worth bothering with. She was given the job of 'mudding tug' - towing the mud <b>hopper</b> <b>barges</b> filled by the canal dredger to the discharge point. Sometimes she was needed to turn ships at Sharpness Docks and assist them in the entrance lock. In 1962â€”1963, when the winter was so cold that the canal froze and the diesel tugs had difficulty in working, Mayflower once again took on ship-towing work in the canal. Finally, British Waterways sold Mayflower for scrap in 1967.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Dredged {{material}} and in situ sediments may contain contaminants at sufficient concentrations to degrade the benthic environment. In cases where unacceptable toxicity or bioaccumulation {{is predicted to}} occur, subaqueous capping {{with a layer of}} clean material is often an acceptable management or remediation alternative. This technical note (TN) describes equipment and placement techniques for subaqueous capping projects. The equipment and techniques are applicable to placement of contaminated material to be capped and clean material to be used for capping and include conventional discharge from <b>barges,</b> <b>hopper</b> dredges, and pipelines; submerged discharge from diffusers and tremies; and surface spreading techniques for cap placement. Both granular capping materials such as sediments and soils and geosynthetic fabrics and armoring materials are considered. BACKGROUND: Detailed guidance on engineering considerations for dredged material capping and in situ sediment capping can be found in Palermo et al. (1998 a, 1998 b). These guidance documents include information on equipment and placement techniques used in projects up to about 1994. The information in this TN is intended to supplement and update the existing guidance on equipment and placement techniques by including descriptions o...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited I This report describes the conceptual {{design of a}} direct pump-out facility for Corps of Engineers 1 hopper dredges. Operational conditions were a significant wave height of 6. 0 ft, wind velocity of 30 knots, I and a current velocity of 2 knots. The mooring system was designed for operation in a minimum depth of 30 ft and a maximum depth of 45 ft. The following operational criteria were also required for the mooring design: (a) transportation by truck or rail, (b) rapid assembly {{with little or no}} diver support, and (c) installation with a minimum of lift support. The report examines five alternatives: (a) a guyed tower, tension leg platform (TLP), (b) a single anchor mooring (SALM), (c) a three-leg catenary anchor leg mooring (CALM), and (d) a four-leg CALM. The four-leg CALM was selected for further study because it best met the operational criteria. To accommodate truck transport, a 28 -ft-long, I 1 -ft 6 -in. -high, 7 -ft 6 -in. -deep capsule buoy was designed.

40|$|A split <b>hopper</b> <b>barge</b> is a {{dredging}} {{vessel that}} can split over its longitudinal axis to discharge its cargo. To allow {{for such an}} operation, the barge consists of two half-hulls that are connected by hinges {{at the top and}} hydraulic cylinders at the bottom. Any forces that act at the interface between the half-hulls have to be transferred by the hinges and cylinders as a result. The aim of this thesis is to develop a method to determine the workability limits of split hopper barges in irregular seas. For this workability of the barge, the design limits of the hinges and hydraulic cylinders are assumed to be governing. A quasi-static model is formulated {{to determine the effects of}} roll, different types of cargo, opening the barge and discharging the cargo on the forces in the hinges and cylinders. The results of the quasi-static model are a set of governing load cases for the split <b>hopper</b> <b>barge.</b> From the quasi-static model, it is found that the forces of interest are the largest for a closed split <b>hopper</b> <b>barge</b> and that either a solid or a liquid cargo will yield the governing load case. To account for the dynamics in irregular sea conditions, a calculation method is proposed based on Ansys AQWA. Since AQWA is not able to account for liquid cargo motions, its effects are incorporated separately. Using WAMIT simulations, the influences of the liquid cargo to the added mass and stiffness of the barge are determined. Based on the WAMIT results the AQWA model is adjusted. Superimposing the results from the quasi-static and dynamic models, the maximum forces in the hinges and hydraulic cylinders are obtained for the governing load cases. By comparing the obtained maximum forces to the design forces, a conclusion on the workability limits of the split <b>hopper</b> <b>barge</b> is drawn. For the barge carrying a solid cargo only one resonance frequency is found, while, due to the liquid cargo motions, the barge with a liquid cargo has two resonance frequencies. As a result, a larger number of combinations of wave directions and periods yield considerable forces. For a 3 -hour-extreme with a significant wave height of 3 meters, the governing hydraulic cylinder forces are found for a barge carrying a liquid cargo. The maximum resulting hinge forces however, are found for a barge carrying a solid cargo. Because the limits of the hinges are exceeded before the limits of the hydraulic cylinders, it is concluded that the workability limits of the split <b>hopper</b> <b>barge</b> in irregular waves are most limited, and therefore governing, for a barge carrying a solid cargo...|$|E

40|$|Bridge fender {{systems are}} used to guide vessels through navigational {{channels}} under bridges.

However, the fenders are not designed to withstand any lateral forces, thus their existing impact capacity is ignored in the design. The paper presents results of research efforts initiated by the Florida Department of Transportation, aimed at evaluating the impact capacity of bridge fenders, and developing possible retrofit recommendations. Project efforts were focused on computational analysis of a Jumbo <b>Hopper</b> <b>barge</b> impacting the fender system. The non-linear finite element computer code LS-DYNA was adopted for analysis. Different initial velocities and impact angles were used to represent possible collision scenarios.

40|$|The inland {{waterway}} {{system in the}} United States is fundamental to the transportation {{system as a whole}} and the success of the nationâ€™s economy. Barge transportation in these waterways levitates congestion on the highway system and is beneficial when comparing barge transportation to other modes of freight transportation in measures of capacity, congestion, emissions, and safety. Unavoidably, the highway system intersects with the waterways, resulting in the risk of vessels collision into bridge structures. Particularly for barge impact, the literature is questioning the accuracy and oversimplification of the current design specifications. The impact problem was investigated in this research using three-dimensional finite-element analyses. To investigate the collision of a barge into a bridge pier, a range of material models are first investigated through simulating a drop-hammer impact onto a reinforced concrete beam. A detailed model of a jumbo <b>hopper</b> <b>barge</b> is then developed, with particular detail in the bow. The barge model is examined for its response to impact into rigid piers of different size and shape. RC piers, having different shape and boundary conditions, are impacted by the barge model and assessed using selected metrics. The final part of the research examines the response of an existing bridge pier subject to an impact by a chemical transporter barge that frequently travels in the waterway...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the structure}} of costs of several processes associated with the shipbuilding industry. The analysed productive processes are: cutting preparation procedures, steel plate cutting processes, processes of hull plates and stiffeners forming, associated transportation and assembling of plates and profiles, and finally the welding processes. The methodology allows a shipyard to identify the main costs related to the manufacturing of the hull and the aspects that should be improved for increase productivity. The methodology adopted may easily be adapted by each shipyard creating a work database {{in order to improve}} and update these formulas by adding new corrective coefficients based on the type of the built ship or construction complexity of certain ship blocks. It is analysed 2 independent case studies that took place at different Portuguese shipyards and covering different aspects of the steel hull shipbuilding processes. The first case study considers time and cost analysis of cutting preparation processes made by the design office, cutting/marking of steel plates and forming processes of stiffeners and hull plates, required for the construction of an 83 m <b>Hopper</b> <b>Barge,</b> built by MPG, at LISNAVE Mitrena Shipyard, Portugal, 2010.

40|$|A barge is {{a vessel}} which is {{designed}} to transport very heavy loads. Barge sterns therefore have steep inclination angles which will yield a large displacement and hence maximize the cargo capacity. In this thesis the barge stern of the split <b>hopper</b> <b>barge</b> D 14 design made by Fartygskonstruktioner AB has been analysed using SHIPFLOW, a CFD software. It is of interest to investigate how the inclination angle affects the resistance of the barge. Since this analysis will focus on the stern, the flow right behind the hull is of importance. Considering that, a zonal approach was chosen for the CFD computations. This approach uses viscous flow computations (or RANS computations) to solve the wake flow at the stern. Two different conditions of the barge have been analysed, a fully loaded condition and a ballast condition. When the barge is fully loaded there is no trim while at ballast condition there is a large trim. As a first step in the analysis computations were run on the initial hull design and the results where then verified with existing results from a resistance test made on a model of the full scale barge. When accurate results had been achieved for the initial stern the analysis continued with computations run on modified sterns where the inclination angle was systematically changed. Unfortunately the analysis could not be completed for ballast condition since a bug in SHIPFLOW was revealed {{and it turned out that}} largely trimmed conditions could not be handled by the software. For the analysis of modified sterns, computations were run on two sterns with a steeper inclination than for the initial stern and two sterns with lesser inclination. The outcome of the computations was that in the speed interval from 9 to 12 knots the initial hull has the lowest total resistance when comparing to the modified sterns, but at speeds lower than 9 knots the steepest inclination resulted in the lowest total resistance...|$|E
