40|$|Dual layer {{polyvinylidene}} fluoride (PVDF), antibacterial, hollow fiber, ultra-filtration composite membranes with antibacterial particles (silver (Ag) nano-particles loaded zeolite (Z-Ag)) {{in the outer}} layer were prepared with high water flux and desired pore sizes. The amounts of Ag+ released from the composite membranes, freshly made and stored in water and salt solution, were measured. The result indicated that dual layer PVDF antibacterial <b>hollowfiber</b> containing Z-Ag (M- 1 -Ag) still possessed the ability of continuous release of Ag+ even after exposure to water with high ionic content, showing a longer term resistance to bacterial adhesion and antibacterial activity than membrane doped with Z-Ag+ (M- 1). Results from an anti-adhesion and bacteria killing test with Escherichia coli supported that the antibacterial efficiency of dual hollow fiber PVDF membranes with Z-Ag was much higher than those with Z-Ag+ after long time storage in water or exposure to phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. This novel hollow fiber membrane may find applications in constructing sea water pretreatment devices with long term antifouling capability for the desalination processes...|$|E
40|$|This work proposes for {{the first}} time the use of <b>hollowfiber</b> flow field-flow {{fractionation}} (HF FlFFF) for improved matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI/TOFMS) of whole bacteria. HF FlFFF has proved to be able to prepurify or fractionate different species of whole bacteria. Sample preparation by HF FlFFF gives improved spectra quality because noncellular components possibly present in the sample can be separated from the cells. When a mixture of two bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli) is fractionated through HF FlFFF, MALDI/TOFMS analysis of each separated bacterial species preserves the most characteristic ion signals of the species without the presence of characteristic signals of the other species. The main advantages of HF FlFFF for MALDI/TOFMS analysis of whole bacteria are miniaturization, simplicity, and low cost of the fractionator components. This low cost makes disposable usage of the fractionator possible, thus eliminating the risk of run-to-run contamination of spectra due to sample carryover. The low fractionator volume yields bacterial fractionation on the order of a few minutes, which is comparable to MALDI/TOFMS analysis time. The small fractionation volume makes sample dilution low enough so that additional sample concentration steps are not strictly required to preserve MALDI/TOFMS detection...|$|E
40|$|A highly {{antibacterial}} of {{hollow fiber}} polyethersulfone (PES) membrane was prepared by loading silver nanoparticles within the PES graft acrylamide (AAm) -membrane. The grafted layers of AAm were provided the matrix for silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) entrapment. The {{characterization of the}} prepared <b>hollowfiber</b> (HF) PES membrane loaded with silver nanoparticles were examined by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To examine the antibacterial property of the prepared AgNPs-AAm-PES membrane, the halo zone and the shaking flask test were carried out. In these tests, both of unmodified PES membrane and AgNPs-AAm-PES membrane were exposed to pure culture suspension of Escherichia coli (E. Coli) bacteria with the concentration of 107 CFU/ml. The viable bacteria formed within the membrane surfaces and themembrane circumferences were observed by the halo zone formation, while the percentage of bacteria killing ratio was determined by shaking flask test method. The TEM {{results showed that the}} silver nanoparticles were formed within grafted layers of AAm-PES membrane and the size of silver nanoparticleswere about 10 nm. The AgNPs-AAm-PES membrane were highly effective to prevent the membrane biofouling as shown by the clearly halo zone formation compared with the unmodified PES membrane. The shake flask test were also revealed that almost 99. 9 percent of the E. coli bacteria were killed when theyhaving exposed to the AgNPs-AAm-PES membrane. This was due to the silver ions are allowed to release from its membrane surfac...|$|E
40|$|Fecal {{contamination}} from non-point {{sources in}} coastal and estuarine water bodies {{is a problem}} of increasing concern. Water monitoring alone is sometimes insufficient in providing a clear picture of the fecal contamination of a water body. Well-formulated and developed mathematical and numerical transport models, on the contrary, predict continuous concentrations of microbial indicators under diverse scenarios of interest, and they can quantify fecal source contributions on a land use basis (human versus livestock or wildlife). The present project has demonstrated the utility of quantitative analyses of fecal contamination in water bodies via new experimental measurement techniques as well as mathematical/numerical modeling of the fate and transport of biological contaminants. San Pablo Bay was selected because there is abundant knowledge about the estuarine system and its tributaries and because of the availability of an existing 3 -dimensional model. Environmental monitoring of San Pablo Bay was performed with a Microbial Source Tracking (MST) approach that utilized a validated large-volume (100 L) <b>hollowfiber</b> ultrafiltration method to concentrate water, which was then tested with quantitative real-time PCR assays to identify and quantify fecal contamination contributed from general and human-, cow- and dog-specific sources. Monitoring of human viral pathogens (adeno- and enteroviruses) was also performed. Additional samples were also collected to enumerate microbial indicators (E. coli and enterococci). This {{was the first time that}} DNA-based molecular assays, which had been previously validated with fecal samples and wastewater effluents in freshwater studies, were applied to an estuarine environment. Monitoring results indicated low-level general and human-derived fecal contamination in the bay, while cow- and dog-derived contamination was not detected, except for one sample which contained dog-specific genetic marker. Human viruses were also below the sample detection limit. The pollution was more likely to come from surrounding urban areas or wastewater treatment facilities than from agricultural farm land or wildlife areas. Another application of the study included the validation of quantitative sea bird-specific molecular DNA assays for the purpose of microbial source tracking to enumerate the contribution of sea birds to fecal contamination. The assay was found to possess adequate sensitivity and specificity and could be applied in the future to archived environmental samples to estimate the contribution from sea birds to bacterial fecal loads in San Pablo Bay and its tributaries. A suite of theoretical and computational tools, ranging from one-dimensional (1 -D) to three-dimensional (3 -D) models, was developed during this project for the analysis of the fate and transport of Bacteroidales gene markers. These models were paired with existing visualization tools. Flow conditions for the sampling dates were simulated and results compared with velocity observations. Exploratory assessments of water quality in the San Pablo Bay allowed for an incipient characterization of the transport conditions in San Pablo Bay. Future work includes the optimization of the water-quality sub-module of the code in order to a) include sediment transport in the bay; b) obtain more reliable results 3 under a wide set of boundary conditions; and c) be able to simulate a wider set of waterquality parameters. Also, the authors would like to add a user-friendly interface to the code to facilitate decision making by coastal managers...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{sea water}} {{desalination}} to produce potable water for maritime vessels {{is essential for}} eliminating storage of potable water. Reverse osmosis (RO) is the technology of choice for desalination purposes; however, raw seawater must undergo pretreatment to avoid rapid fouling and plugging of RO membranes and modules. Current pretreatment technology is effective in the open ocean but in coastal regions involves frequent replacement of filter cartridges and increased maintenance costs. The standard pretreatment process consists of 20 Î¼m cartridge filters and 3 Î¼m cartridge filters in series. Several technologies were considered as options for improving the current pretreatment process. Multimedia filtration followed by hollow-fiber ultrafiltration was considered, but it was rejected {{because of the high}} required membrane surface area, high capital cost, and high pressure drop requirements. Mechanically-enhanced self-cleaning filters, followed by either microfiltration (MF) or ultrafiltration (UF), were also considered. The selfcleaning filters were rejected because of mechanical complexity and high initial investment. The technology selected by The Salty Hogs is a sand filter followed by a 0. 1 Î¼m hollow-fiber microfiltration (HMF) unit. The sand filter is less expensive and less complex than a multimedia filter, and the HMF unit requires much less area and has lower capital costs than a UF unit. The sand filter/HMF combination can handle feeds with various turbidity levels and meet the task requirements to feed 21 gpm of filtered water to the RO unit, which is the flow rate required for the RO unit to produce 12, 000 gallons/day of potable water with 40 % recovery. Although the project focused on oceanic applications, inland water desalination plants can integrate The Salty Hogsâ€™ technology into existing RO desalination processes. This report presents the design for a full-scale, shipboard system that incorporates sand filtration and <b>hollowfiber</b> microfiltration. The shipboard unit is designed for optimal power usage and minimal space requirements. The water provided by the recommended process is filtered to 0. 1 Î¼m, an improvement that will lengthen the lifetime of the current spiral-wound RO membranes. The system is automated to back-wash the sand filters with water and back-flush the HMF membranes with air. Periodic chemical cleaning is required and involves the use of a sodium hydroxide wash followed by an acetic acid rinse. The spent sodium hydroxide and acetic acid solutions will be combined and neutralized before being discharged to the ocean. Task # 5 4 University of Arkansas The economic parameters for the system have been determined. Purchased equipment cost is $ 21, 000, and the total capital investment, based on factored estimates, is $ 133, 000. Over the projected three year lifetime of the RO membranes, the proposed process provides an incremental savings, including reduced maintenance and filter usage, of $ 92, 000, over the three year project lifetime when compared to the current cartridge filter system. The WERC task statement specified a goal for energy usage of 1. 2 HP, which is about 10 % of the total power required for the RO operation. The current full-scale design uses ~ 3 HP...|$|E
40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Farmácia (Toxicologia), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Farmácia, 2017 A {{standard}} truly predictive {{in vitro}} hepatic {{model has been}} sought for reducing animal testing, increasing drug development efficiency and improving prediction of adverse drug reactions. The liver is the main organ responsible for xenobiotic metabolism, being particularly exposed to chemicals and its metabolites. The currently available hepatic in vitro models are insufficient. Those present low biotransformation activity, quickly lose its differentiated phenotype in vitro and/or have relevant interspecies differences. Therefore, the differentiation of stem cells (SC) into hepatocyte-like cells (HLC) has been suggested as an alternative approach to provide a representative human hepatic model. However, a functional hepatocyte-like phenotype {{has not yet been}} achieved. In this thesis, we intended to demonstrate that by (i) using a human neonatal mesenchymal stem cell (hnMSC) source, UCX®, (ii) designing a protocol to differentiate this hnMSC into HLC using the cytokines and growth factors present during liver embryogenesis and (iii) resorting to 3 D culture conditions would provide an environment closer to the in vivo, and allow a more representative cellular morphology, gene expression and biological behaviour of the hepatocyte. Umbilical cord matrix hnMSC were selected for the hepatic differentiation due to its high availability, expansion capacity and genomic stability upon expansion, and, due to its more primordial origin, its higher differentiation capacity relative to other MSC sources. The hepatic differentiation protocol was step-wise developed under 2 D cell culture conditions. FGF- 2 at 4 ng/mL and the absence of FGF- 4 resulted in an improved endoderm commitment and foregut induction during the first step of the differentiation protocol. The epigenetic modifiers trichostatin A (TSA), 5 -azacytidine (5 AZA) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were tested for an improved hepatoblast formation and maturation to HLC. The 21 day-long protocol was extended up to day 34, when a global gene expression analysis was performed. Transcriptomic analyses placed HLC between the HepG 2 cell line and hpHep and distant from hnMSC and allowed us to understand how close we were from the hepatocyte transcriptome. HLC were also characterized up to day 34 at protein and functional level. DMSO at the concentration of 1 % and the cell passage day 17 of the differentiation with 24 h of 5 -AZA treatment, resulted in the best tested protocol. HLC were able to store glycogen, produce albumin and urea and express genes encoding for key hepatic enzymes. Most importantly, HLCs displayed stable UGTs, EROD (CY 1 A 1 / 2), ECOD (CYP 2 B 6, 1 A 2 and 2 E 1), CYP 1 A 1, CYP 2 C 9 and CYP 3 A 4 -dependent activities for 13 days at levels comparable to those observed in cultured primary rat hepatocytes. The presence of the hepatic drug transporters OATP-C and MRP- 2 and evaluation of CYP 450 activity and induction {{of a wide range of}} enzymes was observed for the first time on hnMSC derived HLCs. To further mimic the in vivo developing liver and thus achieve a more mature hepatic phenotype we established the 3 D cultures. hnMSC 3 D cultures aimed at evaluating hnMSC self-assembling capacity as well as the effect of this cell culture condition on its proliferation and/or differentiation potential. Viable and low proliferative hnMSC spheroids were obtained by resorting to (i) dynamic cultures using spinner flask suspension cultures (SFSC); and (ii) static cultures using ultra-low attachment (ULA) plates. In addition, 3 D culture primed the hnMSC to produce a rich ECM and was successfully adapted to serum free conditions, which is particularly relevant for the hepatic differentiation. 3 D culture of HLCs was established as spheroids, formed in ULA plates, and into a <b>hollowfiber</b> perfused bioreactor designed for high density hepatocyte culture. 3 D-HLC showed a partial hepatic zonation, observed by immunofluorescence and glycogen storage staining, and an improved hepatic functionality relative to 2 D-HLC, namely by converting drugs into its specific metabolites and by producing higher amounts of glutathione. A thorough evaluation of 3 D-HLCs biotransformation competency was confirmed using the model drug nevirapine (NVP). 3 D HLCs distinguished from 2 D-HLC by producing all phase I and II metabolites and by showing the modulation of phase I, II and III enzymes expression upon 10 days of NVP treatment. HLC thilomic profile was also presented for the first time. NVP resulted in an increased glutathione synthesis and oxidation in 3 D HLC indicating a higher susceptibility to NVP toxic metabolites relative to 2 D-HLC. The thesis that hnMSC were capable of differentiation into HLC was here proved. By resorting to 3 D culture conditions a more representative hMSC-based in vitro model of the liver physiological conditions was developed, extensively characterized and reinforced by the NVP study. This work highlights the relevance of stem cell derived HLC as an alternative model to study drug metabolism and unveil toxicity alerts associated with drug metabolism and bioactivation. The cellular system here developed is a step towards the 3 R´s implementation in terms of mechanistic studies as well as high-throughput drug screening...|$|E
