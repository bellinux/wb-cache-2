25|$|In the United States and Canada, {{low-voltage}} fuses to 1kV AC rating {{are made}} in accordance with Underwriters Laboratories standard UL 248 or the harmonized Canadian Standards Association standard C22.2 No. 248. This standard applies to fuses rated 1kV or less, AC or DC, and with breaking capacity up to 200kA. These fuses are intended for installations following Canadian <b>Electrical</b> <b>Code,</b> Part I (CEC), or the National <b>Electrical</b> <b>Code,</b> NFPA 70 (NEC).|$|E
25|$|NEMA wall {{receptacles}} can {{be found}} installed in any orientation. Neither NEMA nor the US National <b>Electrical</b> <b>Code</b> nor the Canadian <b>Electrical</b> <b>Code</b> specify a preferred orientation, but the National Electrical Contractors Association's National Electrical Installation Standards (NECA 130-2010) specify that the preferred location of the ground is on top. When the ground blade of a receptacle is on the bottom, the neutral blade is on the upper left and the hot blade is on the upper right. All descriptions below assume this orientation (i.e. clockwise order is ground, neutral, hot for 120V receptacle versions; and counter-clockwise for plug versions).|$|E
25|$|More expensive: If {{high-power}} loudspeakers {{are used}} {{with an emphasis}} on low frequency response, the required transformers will be much larger and will add significant cost to the project. Additionally, in some areas, local building and <b>electrical</b> <b>code</b> requires 70-volt cabling to be carried within conduit, increasing the overall project cost.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{with the}} 2008 National <b>Electrical</b> <b>Code</b> and the 2009 Canadian <b>Electrical</b> <b>Code,</b> listed {{tamper-resistant}} receptacles that address electric shock hazards to children {{must now be}} installed in almost all areas of new or renovated dwellings. According to statistics cited by the NFPA, the code change adds only $40 {{to the cost of}} building an average, 75-receptacle home in the US, yet prevents shock hazards to a child that sticks a single, metal object into the receptacle. The new receptacles are expected {{to reduce the number of}} electric shocks to children because inserting a normal, two-blade electrical plug applies pressure on both sides of the receptacle to open an internal, spring-loaded shutter, but a foreign object fails to do so and therefore does not make contact with the live electrical contacts. However, the device can still be defeated by inserting two objects simultaneously. Despite its weaknesses, the tamper-resistant receptacle is superior to protective plastic outlet caps which must be individually installed on each receptacle (and are a choking hazard when removed), and to sliding covers that children easily learn to defeat.|$|E
25|$|Per UL Standard ANSI/UL 498, a {{receptacle}} (any color) with {{an orange}} triangle, is an isolated ground (IG) device, where the grounding pin of the receptacle {{is connected to}} ground independently of {{the frame of the}} receptacle and wiring outlet box. This is also a requirement of the National <b>Electrical</b> <b>Code</b> (NFPA 70), Article 406. While neither UL nor the CSA require the face of the receptacle to be a specific color, most IG receptacles are orange.|$|E
25|$|The {{dimensions}} and configurations for NEMA connectors {{are given in}} ANSI/NEMA standard WD-6. Underwriters Laboratories maintains UL Standard 498, which specifies construction performance (e.g.: durability, electrical safety, and fire-resistance) for NEMA connectors. These additional requirements allow connectors to be manufactured {{to be compliant with}} the National <b>Electrical</b> <b>Code.</b> The Defense Logistics Agency and General Services Administration maintain Federal Specification W-C-596 and its associated specification sheets. This specification references WD-6 and UL498, and provides additional durability and electrical safety performance criteria for connectors intended for military use.|$|E

25|$|In North America {{receptacles}} {{located in}} places where an easy path to ground exists—such as wet areas and rooms with uncovered concrete floors—must be protected by a GFCI. The US National <b>Electrical</b> <b>Code</b> has required devices in certain locations to be protected by GFCIs since the 1960s. Beginning with underwater swimming pool lights (1968) successive editions of the code have expanded the areas where GFCIs are required to include: construction sites (1974), bathrooms and outdoor areas (1975), garages (1978), areas near hot tubs or spas (1981), hotel bathrooms (1984), kitchen counter receptacles (1987), crawl spaces and unfinished basements (1990), near wet bar sinks (1993), near laundry sinks (2005) and in laundry rooms (2014).|$|E

It is a 240-volt (Level II) charger, and, according to General Motors, can replenish the Volt's batteries in about four hours. Consumer Reports has advised buyers to budget up to , as many older homes may need a substantial electrical upgrade because the U.S. National <b>Electrical</b> <b>Code</b> requires that the charger have its own dedicated 220-volt, 30-amp circuit. Early buyers can benefit from the federal tax credit available for charging equipment.|$|E
2500|$|A red {{receptacle}} {{may indicate}} a special-service outlet {{such as one}} connected to an emergency standby power source. The Canadian <b>Electrical</b> <b>Code</b> requires that [...] "essential" [...] receptacles in hospitals, connected to emergency power systems, must be red.|$|E
50|$|However, most <b>electrical</b> <b>codes</b> now {{prohibit}} the routing of electrical conductors through gas piping, due to concerns about damage to electrical insulation from the rough interiors of {{pipes and fittings}} commonly used for gas.|$|R
50|$|In the USA {{the main}} codes are the International Commercial or Residential <b>Code</b> ICC/IRC, <b>electrical</b> <b>codes</b> and plumbing, {{mechanical}} codes. Fifty {{states and the}} District of Columbia have adopted the I-Codes at the state or jurisdictional level.|$|R
50|$|Storage {{batteries}} {{provided as}} a reserve {{source of energy}} must be installed in accordance with applicable <b>electrical</b> <b>codes</b> and good engineering practice.

2500|$|Equipment {{earthing}} conductors {{provide an}} electrical {{connection between the}} physical ground (earth) and the grounding/bonding system, which connects (bonds) the normally non-current-carrying metallic parts of equipment. According to the U.S. National <b>Electrical</b> <b>Code</b> (NEC), the reason for doing this is to limit the voltage imposed by lightning, line surges, and contact with higher voltage lines.|$|E
2500|$|The National <b>Electrical</b> <b>Code</b> {{has been}} updated for 2014 and it {{addresses}} {{the use of}} Outlet Branch Circuit (OBC) Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI) Receptacles {{as an alternative to}} breakers when used for modifications/ extensions, as replacement receptacles or in new construction. [...] AFCI Receptacles work to address the dangers associated with potentially hazardous arcing conditions (parallel arcs and series arcs) by interrupting power to help prevent dangerous arc-faults that may lead to an electrical fire.|$|E
2500|$|Relying on {{the neutral}} {{conductor}} was a legal grounding method for electric ranges and clothes dryers, under the National <b>Electrical</b> <b>Code</b> from the 1947 to the 1996 editions. Since North American dryers and ranges have certain components (timers, lights, fans, etc.) {{that run on}} 120V, {{this means that the}} neutral wire indirectly used for grounding would also carry current, even under non-fault conditions. Although this is contrary to modern grounding practice, such [...] "grandfathered" [...] installations remain common in older homes in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Modern <b>electrical</b> <b>codes</b> {{generally}} do not require a neutral fuse. Instead, they explicitly forbid configurations that might break continuity of the neutral conductor, unless all associated hot conductors are also simultaneously disconnected (for example, with ganged or [...] "tied" [...] circuit breakers).|$|R
5000|$|Signal {{degradation}} by active devices: Devices such as relays, transistors, and rectifiers create {{noise in}} their respective systems, increasing the likelihood of signal degradation. Arc-fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) devices, required by some recent <b>electrical</b> <b>codes</b> for living spaces, may also attenuate the signals.|$|R

2500|$|In the {{four-wire}} three-phase system, {{sometimes called}} [...] "four-wire wye", the safety ground {{is connected to}} a neutral wire that is physically connected to the zero-voltage side of the three windings of the generator or transformer. [...] Since all power phases are relative to the neutral in this system, if the neutral is disconnected, it can be directly measured. [...] In the U.S., the National <b>Electrical</b> <b>Code</b> requires neutrals to be of this type. [...] In this system, power meters measure and sum all three phases relative to the neutral.|$|E
2500|$|NEMA 10 {{connectors}} are a now deprecated {{type that}} had formerly been {{popular in the}} United States for use with high-wattage electric clothes dryers and kitchen ranges; NEMA 14-30R and -50R connectors are now generally used for these applications. NEMA 10s are classified as 125/250V non-grounding (hot-hot-neutral), and were designed {{to be used in}} a manner that indirectly grounds the appliance frame, though not {{in a manner consistent with}} most modern practice. [...] The older practice was common before the requirement of a separate safety ground was incorporated in the National <b>Electrical</b> <b>Code.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Many older North American sockets {{have two}} {{different}} current and voltage ratings, most commonly 10A 250V/15A 125V. This {{has to do}} with a peculiarity of the National <b>Electrical</b> <b>Code</b> from 1923 to the 1950s. Originally, sockets were rated at 10A 250V, because the NEC limited lighting circuits to 10A. In 1923, the code changed to allow lighting circuits to be fused at 15A, but the previous 10A rule still applied to circuits over 125V. The higher voltages were rarely used for lighting and appliances. Most sockets with this rating are of the [...] "T-slot" [...] type.|$|E
5000|$|Wood {{mouldings}} with grooves cut {{for single}} conductor wires, {{covered by a}} wooden cap strip. These were prohibited in North American <b>electrical</b> <b>codes</b> by 1928. Wooden moulding was also used to some degree in the UK, but was never permitted by German and Austrian rules.|$|R
25|$|Over time, <b>electrical</b> <b>codes</b> in the US and Canada {{began to}} require {{additional}} safety {{features in the}} basic NEMA 5-15R and 5-20R configurations to address specific electric shock hazard concerns.

[...] They are available {{in a variety of}} models including GFCI and tamper-resistant. [...] For added protection, WR receptacles should be protected by Extra-Duty While In-Use or Weather-Resistant Covers. [...] These covers are ruggedly constructed to seal out moisture (dripping or condensing), dust, debris, and insects, while providing easy access to receptacles to allow homeowners to use power tools, trimmers, sprinkler systems, and pumps with confidence and improved safety.|$|E
2500|$|The term plug is {{in general}} and {{technical}} use in all forms of English, common alternatives being power plug, [...] electric plug, and (in the UK) plug top. The normal technical term (in both British and International English) for an AC power socket is socket-outlet, but in non-technical contexts {{a number of other}} terms are in common use. In British English the general term is socket, but there are numerous common alternatives, including power point, plug socket, wall socket, and wall plug. In American English receptacle (which is a term not defined in IEC 60050) is used in official standards and codes such as the NEMA connector standard and the National <b>Electrical</b> <b>Code.</b> [...] The American National Electrical Contractors Association's National Electrical Installation Standards (NECA 130-2010) defines outlet as [...] "A point on the wiring system at which current is taken to supply utilization equipment."
