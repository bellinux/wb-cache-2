Hamlett said that [...] "after the season <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to hang it up. I didn’t want to be in pain every day. I felt like {{it was time to move}} on and live a normal life." [...] He also said, [...] "I’m sure I’ll wish I was still out there playing." [...] In a story with The Florida Times-Union shortly after signing with the Jacksonville Jaguars, Hamlett said, [...] "I just took some time off because I was banged up" [...] and that [...] "I love the game of football, and I wanted to play. The whole [...] kind of got blown out of proportion." [...] He had previously returned to training and began feeling 100 percent in early March. Due to his break, he did not participate in the 2015 NFL Combine or Oregon State's Pro Day.|$|E
500|$|Acting {{gradually}} became {{a passion for}} Hoffman: [...] "I loved the camaraderie of it, the people, and that's when <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> what I wanted to do." [...] At the age of 17, he was selected to attend the 1984 New York State Summer School of the Arts in Saratoga Springs, where he met his future collaborators Bennett Miller and Dan Futterman. Miller later commented on Hoffman's popularity at the time: [...] "We were attracted {{to the fact that}} he was genuinely serious about what he was doing. Even then, he was passionate." [...] Hoffman applied for several drama degree programs and was accepted to New York University's (NYU) Tisch School of the Arts. Between starting on the program and graduating from Fairport High School, he continued his training at the Circle in the Square Theatre's summer program. Hoffman had positive memories of his time at NYU, where he supported himself by working as an usher. With friends, he co-founded the Bullstoi Ensemble acting troupe. He received a drama degree in 1989.|$|E
500|$|In late 1963, Eastwood's co-star on Rawhide, Eric Fleming, {{rejected}} {{an offer}} to star in an Italian-made western called A Fistful of Dollars, to be directed in a remote region of Spain by the then relatively unknown Sergio Leone. Richard Harrison suggested Eastwood to Leone because Harrison knew Eastwood could play a cowboy convincingly. Eastwood thought the film would be an opportunity to escape from his Rawhide image. Eastwood signed a contract for $15,000 in wages for elevenweeks' work, with a bonus of a Mercedes automobile upon completion. Eastwood later spoke of {{the transition from a}} television western to A Fistful of Dollars: [...] "In Rawhide I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat. The hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to be an anti-hero." [...] Eastwood was instrumental in creating the Man with No Name character's distinctive visual style and, although a non-smoker, Leone insisted Eastwood smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the [...] "mask" [...] he was attempting to create for the loner character.|$|E

With all of the festivals and package tours that go through America, I've been talking with our manager and agent for over 10 years now about doing something that focuses on the more progressive, musician-oriented side of hard rock and metal. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to stop talking the talk, lace up and finally walk the walk." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eastwood was not {{the first}} actor {{approached}} to play the main character. Originally, Sergio Leone intended Henry Fonda to play the [...] "Man with No Name." [...] However, the production company could not afford to employ a major Hollywood star. Next, Leone offered Charles Bronson the part. He, too, declined, arguing that the script was bad. Both Fonda and Bronson would later star in Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). Other actors who turned the role down were Henry Silva, Rory Calhoun, Tony Russel, Steve Reeves, Ty Hardin, and James Coburn. Leone then turned his attention to Richard Harrison, an expatriate American actor who had recently starred in the very first Italian western, Duello nel Texas. Harrison, however, had not been impressed with his experience on that previous film and refused. The producers later presented a list of available, lesser-known American actors and asked Harrison for advice. Harrison suggested Eastwood, who he knew could play a cowboy convincingly. Harrison later stated, [...] "Maybe my greatest contribution to cinema was not doing A Fistful of Dollars and recommending Clint for the part." [...] Eastwood later spoke about transitioning from a television western to A Fistful of Dollars: [...] "In Rawhide, I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat ... the hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to be an anti-hero." ...|$|E

But he had eaten too many years at captains' tables not to have proper table manners. At first I thought he was abashed by Miss West's presence. Later, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> due to the presence of the captain. For Captain West had a way with him that I was beginning to learn. Far removed as Mr. Pike and Mr. Mellaire were from the sailors, individuals as they were of an entirely different and superior breed, yet equally as different and far removed from his officers was Captain West. He was a serene and absolute aristocrat. He neither talked [...] "ship" [...] nor anything else to Mr. Pike.|$|E
60|$|No; I can't harness up one horse. But I can four, which compels me to back {{up again}} {{to get to my}} beginning. Having {{selected}} Sonoma Valley for our abiding place, Charmian and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> about time we knew what we had in our own county and the neighbouring ones. How to do it, was the first question. Among our many weaknesses is the one of being old- fashioned. We don't mix with gasolene very well. And, as true sailors should, we naturally gravitate toward horses. Being one of those lucky individuals who carries his office under his hat, I should have to take a typewriter and a load of books along. This put saddle-horses out of the running. Charmian suggested driving a span. She had faith in me; besides, she could drive a span herself. But when I thought of the many mountains to cross, and of crossing them for three months with a poor tired span, I vetoed the proposition and said we'd have to come back to gasolene after all. This she vetoed just as emphatically, and a deadlock obtained until I received inspiration.|$|E
