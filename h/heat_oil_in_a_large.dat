30|$|<b>In</b> heavy <b>oil</b> production, {{the loss}} of energy to ambient {{surroundings}} decreases {{the temperature of the}} heavy <b>oil</b> flowing upwards <b>in</b> <b>a</b> vertical wellbore, which increases the oil viscosity and the oil may not flow normally in the wellbore. Therefore, it is necessary to lower the heavy <b>oil</b> viscosity by <b>heating</b> methods to allow it to be lifted easily. <b>Heating</b> of heavy <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>oil</b> well is achieved by circulating hot water in annuli in the well (tubing-casing annulus, casing-casing annulus). In this paper, based on heat transfer principles and fluid flow theory, a model is developed for produced fluids and hot water flowing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> vertical wellbore. The temperature and pressure of produced fluids and hot water in the wellbore are calculated and the effect of hot water on heavy oil temperature is analyzed. Calculated results show that the hot water circulating in the annuli may effectively <b>heat</b> the heavy <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> the tubing, so as to significantly reduce both oil viscosity and resistance to oil flow.|$|R
40|$|International audienceDue to lipid oxidation, off-flavors, {{characterized}} by a fishy odor, are emitted during the <b>heating</b> of rapeseed <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fryer and affect the flavor of rapeseed oil even at low concentrations. Thus, {{there is a need}} for analytical methods to identify and quantify these products. To study the headspace composition of degraded rapeseed oil, and more specifically the compounds responsible for the fishy odor, a headspace trap gas chromatography with mass spectrometry method was developed and validated. Six volatile compounds formed during the degradation of rapeseed oil were quantified: 1 -penten- 3 -one, (Z) - 4 -heptenal, hexanal, nonanal, (E,E) -heptadienal, and (E) - 2 -heptenal. Validation using accuracy profiles allowed us to determine the valid ranges of concentrations for each compound, with acceptance limits of 40 % and tolerance limits of 80 %. This method was then successfully applied to real samples of degraded oils...|$|R
50|$|A basic cacciatore recipe usually {{begins with}} a couple of tablespoons of olive <b>oil</b> <b>heated</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large frying pan. Chicken parts, dusted with salt and pepper, are seared <b>in</b> the <b>oil</b> for three to four minutes on each side. The chicken is removed from the pan, and most of the fat poured off. The {{remaining}} fat is used to fry the onions, peppers or other vegetables for several minutes. A small can of peeled tomatoes (drained of liquid and chopped coarsely) is typically added to the pan along with rosemary and a half cup of dry red wine. Bay leaf may be used, along with chopped carrot to give extra sweetness. The seared chicken parts are returned to the pan which is then covered. The dish is done after about an hour at a very low simmer. Cacciatore is often served with a rustic bread or pasta on the side.|$|R
50|$|Indian cuisine has a {{large amount}} of {{regional}} variation, with many variations on the basic chicken curry recipe. Indian chicken curry typically starts with whole spices, <b>heated</b> <b>in</b> <b>oil.</b> <b>A</b> sauce is then made with onions, ginger, garlic, and tomatoes, and powdered spices. Bone-in pieces of chicken are then added to the sauce, and simmered until cooked through. In South India, coconut and curry leaves are also popular ingredients. Chicken curry is usually garnished with coriander leaves, and served with rice or roti. Even within the country, there are variations among regions. In Northern India, there the delicacy may be extra cooked with extra spice. Additionally, one can find the dish in several small shops as well as five-star restaurants. Depending on the style of preparation, some versions may be sweeter while others will have a more creamier taste to them due to the ample use of butter and cashewnut paste.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 An {{experimental}} study was performed <b>in</b> which <b>an</b> ammonia-water solution was desorbed within a branching fractal-like microchannel array. The solution {{entered in the}} center of a disk, and flowed out radially until discharging <b>in</b> to <b>a</b> gravity-driven separation chamber. Heat was added to the ammonia-water through a thin wall, above which flowed <b>heat</b> transfer <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> separate branching fractal-like microchannel array. Such arrays have been shown to utilize the increased heat transfer coefficients seen in parallel channel arrays; however, they do so with a lower pressure drop. An experimental flow loop consisting of ammonia-water and <b>heat</b> transfer <b>oil</b> sub-loops was instrumented along with a test manifold for global measurements to be taken. Temperature, pressure, density and mass flow rate measurements permitted calculation of desorption and heat transfer characteristics. Parameters included oil mass flow rate, oil inlet temperature, and strong solution flow rate, while strong solution concentration, temperature, and weak solution pressure were kept constant. The desorber was assumed to achieve equilibrium conditions between the vapor and weak solution in the separation chamber. The exit plenum was large and acted as a flash chamber, making the assumption reasonable. The vapor mass fraction was determined from knowledge of the weak solution saturation temperature. Heat exchanger analyses (LMTD and ε-NTU) were done to determine the heat transfer characteristics of the desorber. Calculated values of UA are shown to be as high as 5. 0 W/K, and desorber heat duties were measured as high as 334 W. Strong solution, at 0. 30 mass fraction, was desorbed into weak solution and vapor with concentrations ranging from 0. 734 to 0. 964. Circulation ratios, defined as strong solution mass flow rate per unit desorbed vapor mass flow rate, varied in this study from 3. 4 to 20. A method for specifying desorber operating conditions is described, <b>in</b> which <b>a</b> minimum desorber heat input per unit vapor flow rate is determined at an optimum circulation ratio. A description of how the circulation ratio behaves as a function of strong solution mass flow rate, oil flow rate, and the maximum temperature difference between oil and ammonia-water solution is shown...|$|R
40|$|Transportation of very viscous fluids through {{pipelines}} {{is a real}} challenge. With {{the depletion}} of light <b>oils</b> <b>in</b> reservoirs, it becomes economically favourable to harvest heavy crude oils to contribute to meeting the ever growing energy demand. A suitable candidate for the transportation of these very viscous oil is by means of core-annular flow. Core-annular flow is a flow regime of liquid-liquid two-phase flow, where a low viscous fluid in the annulus (water) is used to lubricate a high viscous fluid <b>in</b> the core (<b>oil).</b> The pressure drop is considerably reduced compared to single phase oil flow at the same <b>oil</b> flow rate. <b>In</b> this study {{the influence of the}} oil viscosity on oil-water core-annular flow through a horizontal pipe is investigated experimentally. The fixed oil flow rate is set at 0. 35 l/s at which the watercut is varied between 9 % and 25 % and the oil kinematic viscosity is altered by <b>heating</b> up the <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> range from 3000 cSt at 20 °C to 400 cSt at 50 °C. Pressure drop measurements for stable core-annular flow are recorded with an electronic pressure transducer and are scaled with the calculated pressure drop of single phase oil flow. Results for the scaled pressure drop at room temperature are compared to results by Ingen Housz et al. It is concluded that for increasing oil-water viscosity ratio, the scaled pressure drop decreases. At the highest considered viscosity ratio, the scaled pressure drop is almost independent of the watercut. Two models to predict the pressure drop (by Brauner and by Bannwart) are evaluated and deviations between the models and measurements are discussed. Visualisation by means of high-speed camera is applied, where a mirror is placed on top of the visualisation section to capture the front and top view simultaneously. For decreasing oil viscosity, the oil-water interface shows a more irregular wave pattern with shorter wave lengths...|$|R
