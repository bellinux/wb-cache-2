40|$|Phonemic {{compression}} {{schemes for}} hearing aids {{have thus far}} been developed and evaluated based on perceptual criteria such as speech intelligibility, sound comfort, and loudness equalization. Finding compression parameters that opti-mize all of these perceptual metrics has proved difficult. The goal {{of this study was}} to find optimal single-band <b>gain</b> <b>adjustments</b> based on the response of auditory-nerve fibers to speech. Sentences from the TIMIT database were pro-cessed by either the NAL-R or the DSL amplification scheme, and deviations from these linear prescriptions were obtained by adjusting the overall gain from 40 dB below to 40 dB above the prescribed gains in 5 dB steps. Neural responses were obtained using the cat auditory-periphery model of Zilany and Bruce [1, 2]. Sen-tences were analyzed on a phoneme by phoneme basis to find the gain adjust-ment that minimized the difference in neural response to the amplified phoneme in the impaired model and the unamplified phoneme in the normal model. The op-timal <b>gain</b> <b>adjustments</b> were found to depend on whether the error metric included the spike timing information of the neural responses (i. e., a time-resolution of sev-eral microseconds) or just the mean firing rates (i. e., a time-resolution of several milliseconds). To optimize the mean firing rates, <b>gain</b> <b>adjustments</b> on the order of + 10 dB were required above the prescribed linear gains in general. In contrast, <b>gain</b> <b>adjustments</b> on the order of − 10 dB or more below the prescribed linear gains tend to optimize the responses including spike timing information. Wide dy-namic range compression appears to be more beneficial in optimizing the spike timing information than the mean rate information. These results motivate the de-velopment of novel nonlinear amplification schemes that simultaneously optimize both spike-timing and mean-rate neural representations. I...|$|R

50|$|In the {{original}} system, {{as applied to}} 625 line analogue TV, the audio signal was sampled twice during each television line and each sample converted to 10-bit PCM. Two such samples were inserted into the next line synchronising pulse. At the destination, the audio samples were converted back to analogue form and the video waveform restored to normal. Compandors operating on the signal before encoding and after decoding enabled the required signal-to-noise ratio to be achieved. As the PCM noise was predominantly high-pitched, the compandor only needed to operate on the high frequencies. Also, the compandor only operated at high audio levels, so that modulation of the noise by the companding would be masked by the relatively loud high-frequency audio components. A pilot tone at half the sampling frequency was transmitted to enable the expander to track the <b>gain</b> <b>adjustment</b> applied by the compressor, even when the latter was limiting.|$|E
