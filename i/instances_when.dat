5|$|The JNA and the SAO Krajina forces renewed the {{blockade}} in mid-August. Kijevo was captured on 26 August, and subsequently looted and burned. The fighting in Kijevo was significant {{as one of}} the first <b>instances</b> <b>when</b> the JNA openly sided with the SAO Krajina against Croatian authorities. The Croatian police fled Kijevo towards the town of Drniš and the remaining Croatian population left the village.|$|E
5|$|The in-game {{exploration}} is chiefly {{based on}} walking and running; however, there are <b>instances</b> <b>when</b> swimming and sometimes levitation is involved. Transportation of other kinds, such as teleportation, and traveling by boat {{or on the}} back of giant flea-like creatures called silt striders, is available for a fee when moving between the various settlements on Vvardenfell.|$|E
5|$|These factors make eastern Pacific landfalls {{improbable}} {{north of}} about central Baja California. In those <b>instances</b> <b>when</b> upper level steering winds do allow a more northerly path, much cooler sea surface temperatures quickly weaken tropical cyclones that approach California, although torrential rainfall can still occur. For example, the September 24-hour rainfall record for Los Angeles {{is held by}} the 1939 Long Beach Tropical Storm, as of January 2007.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, reviewers noted a lack {{of support}} for {{expandable}} storage, the initial absence of cellular connectivity, and the display's lower-than-expected contrast level, {{as well as an}} absence of a rear-facing camera. For the latter, an explanation from Asus claimed that the company decided to omit such a camera so as to not compromise the user experience and competitive pricing. Some consumers reported <b>instances</b> <b>when</b> the screen would not register inputs while the tablet performed data-intensive operations, while others complained about the build-quality of the screen.|$|E
5|$|The Western Ganga {{administration}} {{was influenced by}} principles stated in the ancient text arthashastra. The praje gavundas mentioned in the Ganga records held responsibilities {{similar to those of}} the village elders (gramavriddhas) mentioned by Kautilya. Succession to the throne was hereditary but there were <b>instances</b> <b>when</b> this was overlooked. The kingdom was divided into Rashtra (district) and further into Visaya (consisting of possibly 1000 villages) and Desa. From the 8th century, the Sanskrit term Visaya was replaced by the Kannada term Nadu. Examples of this change are Sindanadu-8000 and Punnadu-6000, with scholars differing about the significance of the numerical suffix. They opine that it was either the revenue yield of the division computed in cash terms or the number of fighting men in that division or the number of revenue paying hamlets in that division or the number of villages included in that territory.|$|E
5|$|General (Polish: generalny, Latin conventiones generales), held {{in western}} Poland (Greater Poland) at Koło, in {{southern}} Poland (Little Poland) at Nowe Miasto Korczyn, in Masovia at Warsaw, in Red Ruthenia at Sądowa Wisznia (Sudova Vyshnia), and in Lithuania at Wołkowysk (Vawkavysk). The General Sejmiks were composed of delegates elected at the provincial sejmiks, and of Senators. Their {{goal was to}} agree on a position for the General Sejm (Sejm Walny) and issue instructions for the deputies on how they were supposed to vote during the General Sejm. The competences of the general sejmiks were defined by precedent and custom rather than law; on rare <b>instances</b> <b>when</b> external circumstances prevented a national Sejm from being convened (such as 1511, 1513 and 1577), the general sejmiks were seen as competent to legislate on national matters. In the 15th century some general sejmiks reserved the right to accept or reject national legislation. In the 16th century they were tasked with preparing drafts of legislation to be discussed at Sejms. Around the 17th century general sejmiks were mostly abandoned (with the exceptions of those in Royal Prussia, see Prussian estates); instead, provincial deputies would meet in special sessions during the Sejm proper.|$|E

5|$|The route {{started at}} St. Joseph, Missouri on the Missouri River, it then {{followed}} what is modern-day U.S. Highway 36 (US36 the Pony Express Highway) to Marysville, Kansas, where it turned northwest following Little Blue River to Fort Kearny in Nebraska. Through Nebraska it followed the Great Platte River Road, cutting through Gothenburg, Nebraska, clipping {{the edge of}} Colorado at Julesburg, Colorado, and passing Courthouse Rock, Chimney Rock, and Scotts Bluff, before arriving at Fort Laramie in Wyoming. From there it followed the Sweetwater River, passing Independence Rock, Devil's Gate, and Split Rock, to Fort Caspar, through South Pass to Fort Bridger and then down to Salt Lake City. From Salt Lake City it generally followed the Central Nevada Route blazed by Captain James H. Simpson of the Corps of Topographical Engineers in 1859. This route roughly follows today's US50 across Nevada and Utah. It crossed the Great Basin, the Utah-Nevada Desert, and the Sierra Nevada near Lake Tahoe before arriving in Sacramento. Mail was then sent via steamer down the Sacramento River to San Francisco. On a few <b>instances</b> <b>when</b> the steamer was missed, riders took the mail via horseback to Oakland, California.|$|E

50|$|Vessels were {{sometimes}} classified {{according to the}} substantive rank of her commanding officer. For <b>instance,</b> <b>when</b> the commanding officer of a gun-brig or even a cutter was a lieutenant with the status of master-and-commander, the custom was to recategorise the vessel as a sloop. For <b>instance,</b> <b>when</b> Pitt Burnaby Greene, the commanding officer of Bonne Citoyenne in 1811, received his promotion to post-captain, the Navy reclassed the sloop as a post ship.|$|R

25|$|Vector {{graphics}} formats are complementary to raster graphics. Raster graphics is {{the representation}} of images as an array of pixels and is typically used for {{the representation of}} photographic images. Vector graphics consists in encoding information about shapes and colors that comprise the image, which can allow for more flexibility in rendering. There are <b>instances</b> <b>when</b> working with vector tools and formats is best practice, and <b>instances</b> <b>when</b> working with raster tools and formats is best practice. There are times when both formats come together. An understanding of the advantages and limitations of each technology {{and the relationship between}} them is most likely to result in efficient and effective use of tools.|$|E
25|$|Aesthetics {{is another}} reason for the removal of enamel. Removing enamel is {{necessary}} when placing crowns and veneers to enhance the appearance of teeth.

The attackers were essentially invisible in the dark except for brief <b>instances</b> <b>when</b> they fired, but the defensive works were impressive, and the 78th and 102nd New York regiments suffered few casualties in a fight that lasted four hours.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} New York years, the Giants' {{fortunes}} in San Francisco have been mixed.

25|$|Analysts {{say that}} Lazcano's death does not signify {{the end of}} Los Zetas. As seen in other <b>instances</b> <b>when</b> top cartel leaders are taken out, fragmenting within the {{organizations}} occur, causing short-term violence. Los Zetas have a line of succession when leaders are arrested or killed, {{but the problem is}} that most of these replacements are younger, less-experienced members who are likely to resort to violence to maintain their reputation.|$|E

25|$|Even {{if she was}} not {{the chief}} queen, Hla Wun quickly became the king's most trusted confidant and adviser. Chronicles recount several <b>instances</b> <b>when</b> she advised the king (even if he did not always take her advice). Her first key advice was to recall Yazathingyan to put down the rebellions. The king, who had just exiled the old minister, grudgingly agreed to her advice in 1258. Yazathingyan went on to put down the rebellions.|$|E
25|$|The University of Massachusetts {{is governed}} by a lay Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees {{functions}} as a legislative body dealing mainly with questions of policy. The board is not an administrative or management board. In certain rare <b>instances</b> <b>when</b> required by the Massachusetts General Laws, it may function as an appeal body. The board establishes the general policies governing the University, but has delegated many powers to the President and, through the President, to campus administrators for day-to-day-operations.|$|E
25|$|Many {{individuals}} arrested experienced prolonged pretrial detention, often {{ranging from}} months to years. MONUC reported that 70 to 80 percent of detainees nationwide were in pretrial detention. Prison officials often held individuals long after their sentences had expired due to disorganization, judicial inefficiency, or corruption. In several <b>instances</b> <b>when</b> NGOs or MONUC brought cases {{to the attention}} of the government, prison officials released them. Armed groups operating outside government control in parts of the east sometimes detained civilians, often for ransom.|$|E
