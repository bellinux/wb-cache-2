40|$|An outline is {{presented}} of how usabil ity {{issues can be}} incorporated into the design and development process of consumer electronics products. The characteristics of usability of consumer products, and the problems with current user-requirements specifications are discussed. An important part of the user-requirements specification is the user-interface specification which specifies the product's external behaviour in user tenns. It describes for each product's function: (1) how it should be operated by the user, (2) what the effect is, and (3) what kind of feedback is given. The guidelines developed for user-interface specifications are presented. These guidelines contain per product function: (1) descriptions of the user actions (<b>i.</b> e., <b>operational</b> <b>procedure)</b> based on a classification of function types (i. e., structures of useraction sequences), augmented with (2) descriptions of the effect of user actions, and (3) descriptions of the feedback based on a classification of feedback types. In addition, the design rationale has been recorded in order to document and communicate the arguments behind the current guidelines throughout the design process, and to support their evolution in the future...|$|R

40|$|Operational {{satellite}} simulators {{are used}} in space missions to provide validation of Ground Systems and the <b>Operational</b> <b>Procedures</b> before and after launch of satellite. They may simulate the satellite, {{taking into account the}} space environment and the ground stations, providing an accurate and realistic modeling of their interfaces. The simulators must be sufficiently realistic to allow the operators to run flight procedures as if they were interfacing to the real satellite. Furthermore, they allow encountering unknown scenarios that cannot be tested before launch. The advantages of developing simulators include the ability to: (<b>i)</b> validate <b>operational</b> <b>procedures,</b> (ii) train operators before launch and (iii) validate the Satellite Control System (SCS) and the Telemetry and Telecommand database (Williams, 2004). The high cost and the compression of the development timescale of a realistic satellite simulator motivated the definition of a set of functional requirements based on standardized space services, which is presented in this paper. In order to improve as much as possible reusability and consequently decrease cost in development, the use of standards were intensively adopted specially for the satellite independent functions, namely, data handling and communication among ground and on-board systems. Functions related to the on-board data handling computer and its communication with the ground systems were based on the ECSS-E- 70 - 41 A (2003) standard, which focusing on telemetry and telecommand packet utilization definition. The protocol supporting the ground and on-board system communication, at several layers, were based on the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) recommendations. This paper presents the results of modeling a set of generic satellite simulator functional requirements into the UML use case artifact. The satellite and ground station functions are as much general as possible, as they were based on practical publications of related works (Saraf, 2001) and in space service standard (ECSS, 2003). For a new mission definition, the satellite simulator use cases model provided a generic basis with which a specific simulator design could be instantiated. The breakdown and the functions choices allow its reuse for future micro-satellite and small satellite programs in different missions. The paper presents the most common functional requirements of a satellite simulator described in the use case notation of UML. The breakdown of the software into modules, the main functions and the advantages of using use cases to specify this kind of software and the way the use cases helped the development team in the future satellite simulators at INPE are also discussed.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the conversion of}} narrow-to-broadband radiances in the special case of the sensor SEVIRI onboard the satellite Meteosat- 8 of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG). The advent of this new program poses {{the problem of the}} transfer of <b>operational</b> <b>procedures</b> from the previous satellite Meteosat- 7 to MSG. Among these <b>operational</b> <b>procedures</b> are several different implementations of the Heliosat method to convert Meteosat data into irradiance maps. An easy-to-implement fast-running method is proposed that combines the radiances of the two narrow visible bands of SEVIRI to produce broadband radiances that are almost identical to those observed in the broadband channel of Meteosat- 7. A comparison between Meteosat- 7 actual radiances and these simulated-radiances shows errors with a negligible bias and a relative root mean square error (RMSE) of 6 %. After combination with the uncertainties found in the calibration procedures (10 - 13 %), the total relative RMSE on the radiances amounts to 12 - 14 %. It is concluded that the Meteosat- 8 images may be used in <b>operational</b> <b>procedures</b> currently applied to Meteosat- 7 images...|$|R
