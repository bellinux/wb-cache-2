50|$|Modern Air's {{historic}} {{arrival in}} Moscow was memorable {{for a different}} reason as well. In common with other contemporary jet aircraft types, such as the Boeing 707/720, deHavilland Comet, Douglas DC-8, Sud Aviation Caravelle and Vickers VC-10, Convair's 880/990 lacked an auxiliary power unit (APU). This made the Convair jets dependent on an <b>external</b> <b>ground</b> <b>power</b> unit (GPU) to provide electrical power for the aircraft while stationary on the ground, including starting the engines. When Polar Byrd I needed power externally supplied by a GPU to start its engines {{at the end of the}} stopover in Moscow to resume its journey, it was found that the Soviet GPUs could not be connected to the CV-990s air intake valve due to an incompatibility between the ground equipment's fittings and the aircraft's valve. This necessitated flying in a Modern Air GPU from West Berlin and resulted in the delay of the onward flight. It also resulted in a subsequent collaboration between Modern Air's maintenance department and Garrett AiResearch to design and test a CV-990 APU, which was located in a hollow area behind the fuel tank inside the aircraft's inboard anti-shock body on the starboard wing. This however proved unsuccessful, resulting in the unit's removal after the first installation.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>External</b> <b>ground</b> surface {{materials}} produce enormous {{heat output}} and thus raise outdoor temperature, {{as well as}} reflecting solar radiation and creating long wave radiation that enters indoor areas via windows and increases indoor temperature, and thus influence occupant comfort. Using a field experiment and questionnaire study, {{this study examined the}} influence of <b>external</b> <b>ground</b> surface materials on indoor thermal comfort. Experimental results indicate that the subjective and objective thermal comfort evaluation of classrooms with greenery outside is better than that of those with concrete outside. <b>External</b> <b>ground</b> surface material thus physiologically and psychologically influences indoor thermal environment...|$|R

50|$|The Boeing 720 lacked an {{auxiliary}} power unit, and relied instead on <b>ground</b> <b>power</b> and pneumatic air {{to power the}} aircraft's systems, provide air conditioning, and start the engines while on the ground.
