50|$|Proving successful, Deltic Diesel engines {{became a}} common {{power plant in}} small and fast naval craft. The Royal Navy used them first in the Dark class fast attack craft. Subsequently they were used {{in a number of}} other smaller attack craft. Being largely of {{aluminium}} construction, their low magnetic signature allowed their use in mine countermeasures vessels and the Deltic was selected to power the Ton class minesweeper. The Deltic engine is still in service in the Hunt class. These versions are de-rated to reduce <b>engine</b> <b>stress.</b>|$|E
50|$|To {{conserve}} {{fuel and}} <b>engine</b> <b>stress</b> when the aircraft {{were at their}} heaviest, the bombers flew individually at low altitude, usually climbing to bombing altitude {{only in the last}} hour before rendezvous (dictated by weather conditions encountered). After 9 March bombing altitudes rarely exceeded 20,000 feet, reducing the amount of climb required to assemble and further conserving fuel and engine life. Flight profiles were carefully calculated during mission planning and recorded as detailed performance tables, specifying power settings and fuel consumption rates, and carried by the flight deck crews during the mission.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Guinness Book of Records, at 127900 lbf kN, {{the engine}} holds {{the record for}} the highest thrust (although rated at 115300 lbf kN). This thrust record was {{accomplished}} inadvertently as part of a one-hour, triple-red-line <b>engine</b> <b>stress</b> test. To accommodate the increase in torsional stresses, a new steel alloy, GE1014 was created and then machined to extreme tolerances. [...] The new record was set during testing of a GE90-115B development engine at GE Aviations' Peebles Test Operation, which is an outdoor test complex outside Peebles, Ohio. It eclipsed the engine's previous Guinness world record of 122965 lbf kN.|$|E

5000|$|After {{spending}} {{five years}} with Rover, Lombard {{took a job}} with Morris Motors Limited where he {{was put in charge}} of <b>engine</b> <b>stress</b> calculations and worked as a motor car engineer. [...] However, he returned to Rover in 1936 and within four years was part of Maurice Wilks' design team. In April 1940 Lombard began his work with jet engines when the team was entrusted with the task of preparing the Whittle W.2B jet engine for production. His designs during this period incorporated a new combustion system and were the precursor to the later successful Rolls-Royce Derwent and Nene engines, which powered most of the first generation of British jet fighters.|$|E
50|$|The Merlin engines were {{replaced}} with the larger, more powerful and slower-revving Rolls-Royce Griffons with 13 ft (4 m)-diameter contra-rotating propellers. This engine's distinctive noise often caused pilots to develop high-tone deafness. Use of the Griffon was necessitated by the Shackleton weighing more than the preceding Lincoln, and suffering from greater drag. The Griffon provided equivalent power to the Merlins but at lower engine speed, which led to greater fuel efficiency in the dense air encountered at low altitude; the Shackleton would often loiter for several hours at roughly 500 ft or lower when hunting submarines. This use of the Griffons over the Merlins also made for less <b>engine</b> <b>stress</b> and hence greater reliability. Using conventional propellers would have needed an increase in propeller diameter to absorb the engine's power and torque, this not being possible due to space limitations imposed by the undercarriage length and engine nacelle positioning; the contra-rotating propellers gave greater blade area within the same propeller diameter.|$|E
50|$|The brothers' {{involvement}} in the support for the screw propellor was significant, as the British Admiralty was reluctant to change away from paddle wheels, believing the pitching of a ship would lift the propellor clear {{of the water in}} heavy seas causing the <b>engine</b> <b>stress</b> and rendering the vessel hard to control. Francis Pettit Smith and Captain John Ericsson had been trying to demonstrate the potential of the propellor for five years, and eventually it was Smith who formed a company to finance the building of the Archimedes (107 ft length) fitted with a Rennie single cylinder engine and 5 ft 9in screw propellor. It was her successful trials that began in 1839 that led to the admiralty purchasing the Mermaid in 1842 (130 ft length), which was built and engined by Rennie, and fitted with the Rennie's patent propellor of 5 ft 8in diameter. This was followed by the Admiralty fitting a 10-foot diameter Smith's propellor to the unfinished sailing sloop Ardent, which was launched in April 1843 renamed HMS Rattler. The Archimedes was also loaned to Brunel and resulted in him changing the design of the SS Great Britain to screw propulsion, even though the paddle wheels were part constructed, setting back the project by 9 months.|$|E

In IVE 60 modes (indices) are considered for specific power and <b>engine</b> <b>stress.</b> Specific power and <b>engine</b> <b>stress</b> parameters related to each of these 60 modes in the model has been shown in Appendix Table 7. By setting these parameters in a period, the percentage of time that the fleet exists in each index is determinded. <b>Engine</b> <b>stress</b> is also visible in minimum and maximum periods in Appendix Table 7 too. According to the instantaneous and average velocity as well as VSP, the <b>engine</b> <b>stress</b> of most vehicles is within (− 1.6 – 3.1) and {{a very small number of}} them (some imported cars) has the <b>engine</b> <b>stress</b> of 7 or more.|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{inherent}} nature of combustion in the Cylinder of a Conventional Internal combustion <b>engine,</b> <b>stress</b> variation {{as well as}} a certain temperature distribution sets up in the entire piston. Analysis of piston is required because of its shape and it is subjected to both structural and thermal loads. In the present study, piston of a two stroke spark ignition internal combustion engine having maximum power of 6. 5 kW at 5500 RPM, has been designed and analysed. The piston made up of Aluminium 4032 alloy is designed by conventional approach and then both thermal and transient structural analysis have been carried out. The piston has been modeled in CATIA and analysed using ANSYS Workbench. In order to improve the design of piston, two alternative designs have been considered by providing openings at the skirt region of the piston. The analysis showed that this modification improved the thermal performance of the piston. An alternative design with large openings at the skirt region showed the best thermal performance...|$|E
40|$|Global {{demand for}} inexpensive, {{reliable}} power is increasing every year. In Asia, generators powered by stationary gas engines {{are becoming increasingly}} popular in areas where methane gas is available. Engine populations are expected to grow as gas distribution infrastructure is built. Although gas engines may resemble other engine types in their appearance and lubricant specifications, they generally benefit {{from the use of}} lubricants developed specifically for them. This is because gas <b>engines</b> <b>stress</b> crankcase oils in areas that may not be adequately addressed by oils developed for other applications. For instance, gas engines can expose the oil to severe nitration and oxidation conditions, and can be very sensitive to ash content and composition. Oils not designed properly for this application can shorten head rebuild cycles, accelerate sludge build-up, and shorten oil and filter life. In this paper, we provide background on gas engine types and their applications, discuss the formulation requirements for gas engine oils (GEOs), and provide examples of their performance...|$|R

50|$|In {{common with}} the first SR DC {{electric}} locomotives (Class 70), Class 74 utilised a booster set (a motor-generator and flywheel combination) to overcome the problem of gapping. Booster set 836/2D had been designed by English Electric for use in Class 71 and this was retained in the rebuild, although weight considerations meant that the flywheel assembly, separate auxiliary generator and traction motor blowers were removed (the latter leading to the decision to downrate the traction motors). The compact size of the booster permitted a small diesel engine and generator inside the body shell (only a single booster was used in Classes 71 & 74 unlike the two of Class 70). Thus, these locomotives could operate either from a third rail supply at 650 V DC (Eastern & Central sections), 750 V DC (Western section) or from their Paxman 6YJXL 'Ventura' diesel engine, downrated to 650 hp - well within the <b>engine's</b> <b>stress</b> curve and thus greatly extending service intervals. This choice of engine (despite its problems as employed in Class 74) was a good move. 57 of these engines had been supplied for use in Class 14 and a further 20 had been supplied to Scottish workshops of BR for the re-engining program of Class 21 (such locomotives being designated Class 29). Thus a proven track record and a plentiful supply of spares was assured. The Class 71 pantograph for overhead current collection was dispensed with.|$|R
