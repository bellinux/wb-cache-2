5|$|Gannets {{are large}} seabirds that plunge-dive <b>for</b> <b>fish</b> and nest in large colonies. They have a torpedo-shaped body, long, narrow, pointed wings and a fairly long tail. There are about 10 species worldwide, with one {{recorded}} as a rare vagrant to Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5000|$|... 50 {{percent of}} the length of Tenmile Run is private land that is closed <b>for</b> <b>fishing</b> and 45 percent is private land that is open <b>for</b> <b>fishing.</b> 5 {{percent of the}} stream's length is public land that is open <b>for</b> <b>fishing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fish nets have {{different}} sizes. The small sized nets are used <b>for</b> <b>fishing</b> small fish while the big sized nets are used <b>for</b> <b>fishing</b> large <b>fish.</b> <b>For</b> instance half inch {{up to one}} inch grade nets are used <b>for</b> <b>fishing</b> Nkejje, one inch up to 6 inch grade <b>for</b> <b>fishing</b> tilapia, and above 6 inch for Nile perch. The fishermen use boats to haul the nest. The bigger the boat, the larger the volume of fish. One net can weigh up to 10 kg, without fish. A small boat {{may not be able}} to handle such a load.|$|R
5000|$|The {{territory}} of the ZEC has 110 lakes <b>for</b> <b>fishing</b> the brook trout and two lakes <b>for</b> <b>fishing</b> [...] "lake trout".|$|R
5|$|In 1987, {{just five}} bird species were {{confirmed}} in the watershed, while <b>for</b> <b>fish,</b> benthic invertebrates, and certain insects {{there were no}} confirmed observations, {{in part due to}} insufficient site coverage.|$|E
5|$|McKellen is an atheist. In {{the late}} 1980s, McKellen lost his {{appetite}} for meat except <b>for</b> <b>fish,</b> {{and has since}} followed a mainly pescetarian diet. In 2001, Ian McKellen received the Artist Citizen of the World Award (France).|$|E
5|$|Phumdis {{are used}} by the local people for {{constructing}} their huts for fishing and other livelihood uses, and are inhabited by about 4000 people. Athapums are artificial circular phumdis, built by the villagers as enclosures <b>for</b> <b>fish</b> farming; aquaculture has caused proliferation of the phumdis in the lake.|$|E

50|$|FishingBooker is an {{internet}} startup built around an online booking site <b>for</b> <b>fishing</b> charters. In 2014, FishingBooker won the Audience Choice award at TechCrunch Disrupt SF. The site {{has been described}} as “Airbnb <b>for</b> <b>fishing</b> charters”.|$|R
25|$|Bass {{boats are}} small {{aluminium}} or fibreglass boats used in {{lakes and rivers}} in the U.S. <b>for</b> <b>fishing</b> bass and other panfish. They have swivel chairs for the anglers, storage bins <b>for</b> <b>fishing</b> tackle, and a tank with recirculating water <b>for</b> caught <b>fish.</b> They are usually fitted with an outboard motor and a trolling motor.|$|R
5|$|Survivor: Borneo {{was criticized}} by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in {{response}} to footage showing the contestants trapping rats on the island, initially <b>for</b> <b>fish</b> bait but later for human consumption.|$|E
5|$|The {{drainage}} basin of Nanticoke Creek is {{designated as a}} Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. In the 1970s, the Operation Scarlift report for the creek noted that the creek was almost entirely devoid of aquatic life due to low water quality. However, the creek had potential <b>for</b> <b>fish</b> life.|$|E
5|$|The sulids {{comprise}} the gannets and boobies with only boobies occurring in Vieques. Both groups are medium-large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive <b>for</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|E

5|$|The sulids {{comprise}} the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium-large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive <b>for</b> <b>fish.</b> A single species {{has been recorded}} from Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|The sulids {{comprise}} the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium-large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive <b>for</b> <b>fish.</b> Four {{species have been}} recorded in South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1999 for the City of Portland by researchers from Portland State University found that Johnson Creek had marginal conditions for macroinvertebrates, {{an important source}} of food <b>for</b> <b>fish</b> and other aquatic life. The study compared differences in these life forms and in water chemistry from two urban streams, Johnson Creek and Tryon Creek in southwest Portland, with two nearby rural streams and found that benthic communities in the urban streams were degraded compared to the regional reference creeks.|$|E

5|$|Aetosaur remains {{have been}} found since the early 19th century, {{although}} the very first remains that were described were mistaken <b>for</b> <b>fish</b> scales. Aetosaurs were later recognized as crocodile relatives, with early paleontologists considering them to be semiaquatic scavengers. They are now considered to have been entirely terrestrial animals. Some forms have characteristics {{that may have been}} adaptations to digging for food. There is also evidence that some if not all aetosaurs made nests.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the main}} stem of Shamokin Creek is {{designated}} as a Warmwater Fishery, all of its tributaries are designated as Coldwater Fisheries. Some tributaries, such as North Branch Shamokin Creek and Quaker Run, lack fish life. However, several fish species have been observed in Carbon Run and downstream tributaries such as Trout Run, Bennys Run, Millers Run, and Lick Creek have supported healthy communities of aquatic life. Additionally, a small hatchery <b>for</b> <b>fish</b> is maintained {{at the mouth of}} Trout Run by local sportsmen.|$|E
5|$|From {{the figure}} 8, {{it is clear}} that an economy {{operating}} at a position where the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be Pareto efficient. This is because the rate at which, say Friday is willing to trade coconuts <b>for</b> <b>fish</b> is different from the rate at which coconuts can be transformed into fish. Thus, {{there is a way to}} make Friday better off by rearranging the production pattern.|$|E

5|$|Hippo {{defecation}} creates allochthonous {{deposits of}} organic matter along the river beds. These deposits have an unclear ecological function. A 2015 study suggests that hippo dung provides nutrients from terrestrial material <b>for</b> <b>fish</b> and aquatic invertebrates. Because of their size and their habit of taking the same paths to feed, hippos can {{have a significant impact}} on the land across which they walk, both by keeping the land clear of vegetation and depressing the ground. Over prolonged periods, hippos can divert the paths of swamps and channels.|$|E
5|$|In {{a school}} of Pacific blue-eyes that is threatened, a few {{individuals}} accelerate and change direction, which initiates an escape wave that spreads through the whole cohort. Animals are known to dart in random directions and speeds as an escape response when threatened. Pacific blue-eyes on their own dart in this manner for up to ten seconds after being faced with a threat at close range. This period is briefer when faced with more distant threats or <b>for</b> <b>fish</b> in schools.|$|E
5|$|In {{most places}} on Fishing Creek, {{there is not}} enough {{dissolved}} aluminum to be toxic, although East Branch Fishing Creek has aluminum concentrations of over 100μg per liter, approaching a lethal level <b>for</b> <b>fish.</b> Fishing Creek itself and all its other tributaries have concentrations of less than 70μg per liter. The concentration is seasonal: aluminum trapped in frozen ground is released into the streams when the soil thaws. As a result, aluminum levels in the creek peak in March and April and drop to almost zero in the summer.|$|E
