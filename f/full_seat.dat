2500|$|Due to {{the runway}} length and the {{distance}} to South Africa (3700km to Johannesburg), a Boeing 737-700 flying to Johannesburg serving St Helena {{would not be able}} to use its <b>full</b> <b>seat</b> and cargo capacity. Only flights to and from Namibian and Angolan destinations would allow using a Boeing 737-700 near its full load capacity. This was under the condition that both directions of the runway were available so tailwind landings could be avoided. The other planned destination, London, requires a fuel stop in Gambia, at almost the same distance as Johannesburg. [...] However, if Wideawake Airfield on Ascension Island was open for commercial non-military flights, it could be listed as an alternate aerodrome; as it is only 1300km from St Helena this would mean that the load capacity of an inbound Boeing 737-700 could be increased as smaller fuel reserves would be required, since the alternate aerodrome could be used in case of problems at St. Helena.|$|E
2500|$|The airport {{by design}} can {{accommodate}} {{up to two}} twin-engined passenger aircraft up {{to the size of}} the Airbus A319, Boeing 737, and the Boeing 757-200. Following a decision to build a shorter runway of 1,550 metres the planned use of Boeing 737-800 aircraft had been ruled out. Instead the airport was to be designed to receive Boeing 737-700 aircraft. However, on 17 July 2012, the St Helena Government and Basil Read agreed to a change to the runway design, which including widening the embankment over an additional [...] at the southern end, paving an additional [...] of the runway with concrete, providing larger turning circles at the runway ends, and increasing the size of the apron. [...] As a result of wind shear issues discovered during commissioning of the airport, and the resulting need to land with a tailwind, even further restrictions on the aircraft have been shown to be needed. [...] Airlink decided to use a Brazilian Embraer E190 which is more compatible than larger aircraft with tailwind landings. However it still cannot use the <b>full</b> <b>seat</b> and cargo capacity.|$|E
