However, the line was expected to take a significant downturn, given the loss of All-Southern tackles Josh Cody and Tom Lipscomb. Cody coached Mercer in 1920. Ends Alfred T.

In all, Vanderbilt expected to lose seven players to graduation following the 1919 season, and therefore to have a 1920 squad built of many new faces. However, Vanderbilt still returned seventeen lettermen.|$|E

[...] In a more mixed review, Nick Levine of Digital Spy awarded it three out of five stars and said that it lacked [...] "original ideas", but said that it [...] "does at least <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> chorus".

500|$|Williams {{believed}} that most {{games on the}} market failed to create a correct representation of the war experience, or express the psychological changes that some combatants experience after participating in a war. He added that a war is not as straightforward and immature as it is often portrayed in various shooters. As a result, a central theme of the game revolves around the moral aspect of war. By using this theme, the team hoped {{to tell a story}} and provide an experience that feels realistic, covering the combatants' mental changes during and after a military conflict, similar to how movies in the 1970s and 1980s, such as Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now convey these messages. The team had the intention to give players the opportunity to show that a shooter can also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> story capable of invoking emotions. To achieve this, the team simplified their original story setting of having Konrad as a [...] "megalomaniac with messianic delusions" [...] to a setting that is more similar to Heart of Darkness.|$|E

He also believed that his daughter, given her illegitimacy, would have a far better chance of marrying well in Italy than she would in England. A Roman Catholic girl with a suitable dowry, raised in a convent, would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> chance of marrying into high Italian society. He wanted the child to become a Roman Catholic, which he viewed as the [...] "best religion." [...] "If Claire thinks that she shall ever interfere with the child's morals or education, she mistakes; she never shall," [...] wrote Byron in a letter to Richard Belgrave Hoppner in September 1820. [...] "The girl shall be a Christian and a married woman, if possible." [...] Her mother could see Allegra, he added, only with the [...] "proper restrictions." [...] Byron wrote to Hoppner in March 1821 that Allegra would receive better care in the convent than she would with him. His mistress, Teresa, Countess Guiccioli, had had a happy experience at the convent boarding school where she had lived from the age of five, and had persuaded Byron that a convent school would be the best place for Allegra. He also viewed the convent as the safest place for her with revolution brewing in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.|$|E
500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following.

He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. I hear from a lot of people and I enjoy that. Like anybody, I like praise.

2500|$|Choosing a {{place like}} Naqsh-e Rustam, which is {{mausoleum}} of Achaemenid shahs, for carving and inscribing, {{the site of the}} temple of Anahita in Istakhr and the existence of the names of some Achaemenid shahs as ancestors in the legendary Sasanian family tree show the existence of an inclination toward the Achaemenids in the early Sasanian period. There are many proofs in Middle Persian and Arabic-Persian writings that show the Sasanians' aggressive confrontation with Rome in order to return to the magnificent past status in the west and it had been assumed that the glory was taken by the Romans. About that, Al-Tabari has mentioned that Ardashir claimed and announced that he had risen to take the revenge of Darius III, who had been defeated and killed by Alexander III of Macedon. Roman historians like Herodian and Cassius Dio have also mentioned reports about [...] "the Sasanians' desire to return to the magnificence and kingdom of the Achaemenids"; these reports of Roman historians show that the Romans had understood the goals of the Sasanian foreign policy well; though they did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> understanding of the change and transformation in the royal Iranian continuum. It {{should be noted that the}} place of Alexander, who was known as a nemesis of Iran, in the thought of the Sasanians' desire for return at the time was simultaneous and aligned with the idea of [...] "following and honoring Alexander" [...] in the Roman emperors; Caracalla called himself [...] "the second Alexander" [...] and [...] "Severus Alexander" [...] honored him. Kettenhofen, Robin and Heuse believe that the class of Greek-Roman sources that have reported the Sasanians' familiarity with the Achaemenids and their desire for return to and extension of the Achaemenid lands had propagative applications and should be interpreted in the frame of the Roman empire thoughts. But what is clear is Ardashir's and later his son Shapur's claim of Roman lands. Daryee believes that the cause of Ardashir and Shapur's wars with Rome was to accommodate their territorial ideals with traditions; he believes that the Sasanians' claim of Asian lands as their fathers' legacy had a mythical basis and originated from the mythical story of Fereydun dividing the world between his sons (Salm, Tur and Iraj); in that myth, Fereydun grants the reign of Turan to Tur and Rome to Salm and Iran, which is the best land in the world, to Iraj; the brothers become envious of the latter and the world goes under war. Thus, the Sasanians considered themselves Iraj's children and the Romans Salm's heirs by a mythical view. Daryee adds that only by that way the Sasanians' territorial claims, which are mentioned in Cassius Dio and Herodian's works, can be understood. He believes that the Sasanians' territorial claims were basically different from those of the Achaemenids.|$|E
