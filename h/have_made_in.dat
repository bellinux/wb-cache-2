5|$|The Marian {{government}} {{produced a}} pamphlet with all six recantations plus {{the text of}} the speech Cranmer was to <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> the University Church. His subsequent withdrawal of his recantations was not mentioned, though what actually happened soon became common knowledge, undermining the effectiveness of Marian propaganda. Similarly, the Protestant party had difficulty in making use of the event, given Cranmer's recantations. The exiles' propaganda concentrated on publishing various specimens of his writings. Eventually John Foxe put Cranmer's story to effective use in 1559, and it features prominently in his Acts and Monuments when it was first printed in 1563.|$|E

25|$|While {{the loss}} of skilled labor {{represents}} a potential cost for countries of origin, it can also at times be beneficial. For instance, {{if there is no}} room in the economy of the home country to use the skilled labor, then it is better for the workers to migrate and send back remittances. When these remittances are greater than what the migrant would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> the home country, it is also beneficial. Another example is when the migrants return with new skills, knowledge, and capacities. Lastly, the movement of skilled labor is beneficial for the country of origin when migrants forge strong economic connections between the home and host country.|$|E
25|$|One belief {{was that}} American Indians were too unsophisticated to have {{constructed}} such complex earthworks and artifacts. The associated stone, metal, and clay artifacts {{were thought to}} be too complex for the Indians to <b>have</b> <b>made.</b> <b>In</b> the American Southeast, and Midwest, numerous Indian cultures were sedentary and used agriculture. Numerous Indian towns had built surrounding stockades for defense. Capable of this type of construction, they and ancestors could have built mounds, but people who believed that the Indians did not build the earthworks did not analyze it in this manner. They thought the Native American nomadic cultures would not organize to build such monuments, for failure to devote the time and effort to construct such time-consuming projects.|$|E

25|$|Cold fusion setups utilize {{an input}} power source (to ostensibly provide {{activation}} energy), a platinum group electrode, a deuterium or hydrogen source, a calorimeter, and, at times, detectors {{to look for}} byproducts such as helium or neutrons. Critics have variously taken issue with each of these aspects and have asserted that there {{has not yet been}} a consistent reproduction of claimed cold fusion results in either energy output or byproducts. Some cold fusion researchers who claim that they can consistently measure an excess heat effect have argued that the apparent lack of reproducibility might be attributable to a lack of quality control in the electrode metal or the amount of hydrogen or deuterium loaded in the system. Critics have further taken issue with what they describe as mistakes or errors of interpretation that cold fusion researchers <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> calorimetry analyses and energy budgets.|$|E

Allardyce left West Ham on 24 May 2015, {{the final day of}} the season, after his contract was not renewed. Allardyce stated that [...] "I didn't want to stay.

500|$|Jagnow {{commented on}} several changes the {{developers}} would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> hindsight {{after the completion}} of the ARG. One aspect he considered was the weak part of the fiction of the ARG, something he believed they would have integrated more in the game from the start. The release of the Potato Sack on April 1 may have been a bad decision according to Jagnow, as they did not get the press exposure they thought they would in conjunction with the other April Fool's events occurring that day, with some media outlets hesitant to report on potential pranks for fear of having to retract these later. In the third phase, where certain players were [...] "taken over" [...] by GLaDOS, Jagnow felt they extracted these players from the game too early as they were influential in coordinating the chat rooms and wiki, leaving the remaining players confused. Instead, Jagnow suggested they should {{have found a way to}} allow these players to continue participating until near the end. Jagnow considered the push of the crescendo of the ARG, the [...] "appearance" [...] of GLaDOS@Home, to have been the biggest failing. Originally scheduled for April 16 or 17, it was pushed to April 15 to allow more players, including international ones, to participate in the effort to release Portal 2 early, and to gain media attention. [...] Instead, the developers found that existing players of the ARG were frustrated with no new puzzles to solves, while new players brought to the site by the media were skeptical and saw the event as [...] "a cheap media ploy to get players to buy the Potato Sack in the hope of an early Portal 2 release".|$|E
