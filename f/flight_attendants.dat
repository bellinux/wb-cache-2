5|$|According to <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong, who {{contacted}} American Airlines {{during the}} hijacking, the hijackers had stabbed <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui and slashed {{the throat of}} passenger Daniel Lewin. Lewin, an American-Israeli Internet entrepreneur who understood Arabic, had served as {{an officer in the}} elite Sayeret Matkal special operations unit of the Israel Defense Forces. Lewin was seated in 9B, and Suqami was directly behind him in 10B. The 9/11 Commission suggested that Suqami may have stabbed and killed Lewin after he attempted to stop the hijacking. Lewin {{is believed to be the}} first fatality in the 9/11 attacks. During a four-minute call to the American Airlines operations center, Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, lack of access to the cockpit, and passenger injuries. She provided the seat locations of the hijackers, which later helped investigators to determine their identities.|$|E

Charlie runs by while being called after by <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> before turbulence shakes the plane, scaring Rose, who is sitting across from Jack. The two talk, and Rose mentions that her husband is in the bathroom. The plane gets exceptionally shaky, causing a man to hit the plane's ceiling and oxygen masks to fall.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} to lease two Boeing 737-300 aircraft from 1994 {{was made with}} International Lease Finance Corporation in May. Maintenance was outsourced to a British company, after Braathens, which also operated 737 Classic aircraft, had denied Color Air the use of its simulators and technical workshops. For the start-up, Color Air hired 18 pilots, 40 <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> and 40 ground employees, {{in addition to the}} administration. The company was criticized for only hiring women <b>flight</b> <b>attendants.</b> Braathens operated with an internal pension age of 58 years for its pilots, while SAS had a 60-year age limit. Due to EEA rules, the judicial age limit was 65 years, so Color Air was able to hire retired SAS and Braathens pilots. These could be paid only NOK500,000 in annual wage, since they received a full pension from their old employers on top of it. The Norwegian Airline Pilots Association stated that this was morally reprehensible, but Color Air was supported by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority, medical experts, and SAS, who all claimed that there were no medical reasons to not let people in their 60s operate aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} operates five Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports, {{the first}} of which entered service in June 2011. Two more are due for delivery in 2018. The aircraft are crewed by pilots, refuelling operators and <b>flight</b> <b>attendants.</b> Air-to-air refuelling is considered a force multiplier, permitting the RAAF to increase the range and loiter time of its aircraft. The ability to refuel in flight also enables aircraft to take off with more ordnance than they might otherwise.|$|E

50|$|Hochschild gives a clear example on how {{companies}} {{maximize their}} profits {{through the use}} of feeling rules by viewing the job of a <b>flight</b> <b>attendant.</b> A <b>flight</b> <b>attendant's</b> job requires emotional labor. The flight attendance uplifts the customer through his or her demeanor and expression of feelings. A <b>flight</b> <b>attendant</b> who is constantly smiling or asking the customer how they are doing is more comforting to a customer versus if a <b>flight</b> <b>attendant</b> who rolls their eyes and rarely smiles. The feeling rules for a <b>flight</b> <b>attendant</b> calls for them to be happy, calm, and to suppress their negative feelings. Customers who see the way the <b>flight</b> <b>attendant</b> upholds themselves are more likely to come back if the experience was pleasant. Which is why many airlines like Delta, which was rated {{as one of the top}} airlines calls and requires these feeling rules at the workplace. In a way, this is beneficial to the companies and the customer because the customer is satisfied and keeps coming back, which makes the company more money. However, at the same time, it can be harmful to the <b>flight</b> <b>attendant</b> because they are not able to express their feelings, but rather suppress their feelings for the benefit of others.|$|R

5|$|As of 2011, No.34 Squadron's {{strength}} included around thirty {{pilots and}} thirty <b>flight</b> <b>attendants.</b> Captains are generally senior pilots who have previously flown the RAAF's Boeing C-17 Globemaster, Lockheed C-130 Hercules, or Lockheed AP-3C Orion. Their co-pilots are new RAAF personnel who have recently graduated from No.2 Flying Training School, {{and the crew}} attendants are posted to the squadron after completing training and a period of service with No.33 Squadron. The squadron's VIP Operations Cell (VIPOPS) is responsible for managing requests for VIP air transport as well as dedicated security staff. Most logistical support, including meal preparation, is provided under commercial arrangements rather than by RAAF personnel.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen {{minutes into}} the flight, the hijackers injured at least three people (possibly killing one), {{forcibly}} breached the cockpit, and overpowered the captain and first officer. Atta, an al-Qaeda member and licensed commercial pilot, took over the controls. Air-traffic controllers noticed the flight was in distress when the crew was no longer responding. They realized the flight had been hijacked when Mohamed Atta's announcements for passengers were transmitted to air traffic control. On board, <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong contacted American Airlines, and provided information about the hijackers and injuries to passengers and crew.|$|E

5|$|The ao dai {{is now a}} {{standard}} for weddings, for celebrating T·∫øt and for other formal occasions. It's the required uniform for female teachers (mostly {{from high school to}} below) and female students in common high schools in the South; there is no requirement for color or pattern for teachers while students use plain white with some small patterns like flowers for school uniform. Companies often require their female staff to wear uniforms that include the ao dai, so <b>flight</b> <b>attendants,</b> receptionists, bank female staff, restaurant staff, and hotel workers in Vietnam may be seen wearing it.|$|E
5|$|By 07:40, {{all five}} hijackers were aboard the flight, which was {{scheduled}} to depart at 07:45. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri sat together in first class in seats 2A and 2B respectively.

Flight11 was hijacked at approximately 08:14, which is when the pilot stopped responding to air traffic control. Once the hijacking began, the brothers are suspected of having stabbed two <b>flight</b> <b>attendants.</b> At 08:46:40, Mohamed Atta deliberately crashed Flight11 into the northern facade of the North Tower (Tower1) of the World Trade Center. The immediate damage destroyed any means of escape from above the impact zone, trapping 1,344people. The North Tower collapsed at 10:28, after burning for 102 minutes.|$|E
