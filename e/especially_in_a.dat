5|$|Although {{she enjoyed}} {{motherhood}} and assumed {{primary responsibility for}} rearing the children, Stanton found herself unsatisfied and even depressed {{by the lack of}} intellectual companionship and stimulation in Seneca Falls. Throughout this period of removal from the woman’s movement, Stanton kept in touch with Susan B. Anthony, and writing Anthony’s speeches became one of Stanton’s primary modes of involvement in the movement from afar. Additionally, Stanton often wrote Anthony letters about the difficulties of balancing domestic and public life, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> prejudiced society. As another antidote to the boredom and loneliness, Stanton became increasingly involved in the community and, by 1848, had established ties to similarly minded women in the area. By this time, she was firmly committed to the nascent women's rights movement and was ready to engage in organized activism.|$|E
5|$|In early 2010, Kieswetter {{achieved}} his target; {{some strong}} performances for the England Lions, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> match against the senior England team, won him {{a place in}} the squad to face Bangladesh. His selection, along with the presence of other South African-born players in the England team, was criticised; some commentators suggested there should be fewer foreign-born players in the team. Kieswetter scored his only international century in his third match, and a couple of months later he was the man of the match in the final when England won the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. After a promising start for England, he was dropped owing to his inconsistency before the end of 2010. He returned to the team the following year, but his place was insecure, and in 2013 he was replaced by Jos Buttler, his teammate at Somerset.|$|E

5|$|In {{selecting}} Ved Vejen for the Danish Culture Canon, {{the selection}} committee {{operating under the}} Danish Ministry of Culture explained that the attraction {{of the novel is}} that it portrays with considerable empathy how a meek young woman becomes increasingly aware of desires she hardly knew she possessed. With bittersweet irony, the author allows Katinka to develop her infatuation by listening to the heartaches of others. With its almost cinematic sequences, the novel conveys a balance between its subdued humour and a strong sympathy for what goes on in people's minds, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> secluded environment removed from mainstream society. It is not just Bang's portrayal of a bygone provincial world that seems so typically Danish but his mastery in making the hidden pain of loneliness so meaningful to today's readership. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow, starring Tammi Øst as Katinka.|$|E
5|$|Military {{architecture}} was {{the supreme}} {{expression of the}} Ayyubid period, {{as well as an}} eagerness to fortify the restoration of Sunni Islam, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> previously Shia-dominated Egypt by constructing Sunni madrasas. The most radical change Saladin implemented in Egypt was the enclosure of Cairo and al-Fustat within one city wall. Some of the techniques of fortification were learned from the Crusaders, such as curtain walls following the natural topography. Many were also inherited from the Fatimids like machicolations and round towers, while other techniques were developed simultaneously by the Ayyubids, particularly concentric planning.|$|E
5|$|Shepard was {{assigned}} to Fighter Squadron 42 (VF-42), flying the Vought F4U Corsair. The squadron was nominally based on the aircraft carrier , but the ship was being overhauled at the time Shepard arrived, {{and in the meantime}} the squadron was based at Naval Air Station Norfolk in Virginia. He departed on his first cruise, of the Caribbean, on Franklin D. Roosevelt with VF-42 in 1948. Most of the aviators were, like Shepard, on their first assignment. Those that were not were given the opportunity to qualify for night landings on a carrier, a dangerous maneuver, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Corsair, which had to bank sharply on approach. Shepard managed to persuade his squadron commander to allow him to qualify as well. After briefly returning to Norfolk, the carrier set out on a nine-month tour of the Mediterranean Sea. He earned a reputation for carousing and chasing women. He also instituted a ritual of, whenever he could, calling Louise at 17:00 (her time) each day.|$|E

5|$|After campaigning {{against the}} Thracian ruler Cersobleptes, Philip II began his {{war against the}} Chalcidian League in 349 BC, which had been {{reestablished}} in 375 BC following a temporary disbandment. Despite an Athenian intervention by Charidemus, Olynthos was captured by Philip II in 348 BC, whereupon he sold its inhabitants into slavery, bringing back some Athenian citizens to Macedonia as slaves as well. The Athenians, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of speeches by Demosthenes known as the Olynthiacs, were unsuccessful in persuading their allies to counterattack, so in 346 BC, they concluded a treaty with Macedonia known as the Peace of Philocrates. The treaty stipulated that Athens would relinquish claims to Macedonian coastal territories, the Chalcidice, and Amphipolis {{in return for the}} release of the enslaved Athenians as well as guarantees that Philip would not attack Athenian settlements in the Thracian Chersonese. Meanwhile, Phocis and Thermopylae were captured, the Delphic temple robbers executed, and Philip II was awarded the two Phocian seats on the Amphictyonic Council as well as the position of master of ceremonies over the Pythian Games. Athens initially opposed his membership on the council and refused to attend the games in protest, but they were eventually swayed to accept these conditions, partially due to the oration On the Peace by Demosthenes.|$|E

5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} release of his Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell in 1845, Thomas Carlyle was asked to view the head. He did not, and {{on the basis of a}} friend's visit, wrote a scathing {{dismissal}} of the authenticity of the head: “it has hair, flesh and beard, a written history bearing that it was procured for £100 (I think of bad debt) about 50 years ago...the whole affair appears to be fraudulent moonshine, an element not pleasant even to glance into, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> case like Oliver's.” Fitzgibbons 2008, Pearson and Morant agree that Carlyle's dismissal was not based on any historical or scientific fact. Although Carlyle conceded that it was “the head of some decapitated man of distinction”, the only other known man of distinction to be embalmed and then decapitated in such a manner over the previous 200 years was Henry Ireton. George Rolleston had conducted an examination on another skull—called the Ashmolean skull—after claims that it was Cromwell's head. Rolleston was unconvinced by the skull's supposed history, and visited Wilkinson's home to see the skull shortly afterwards. After an examination, he dismissed the Ashmolean skull as a fake and declared that the Wilkinson head was the real head of Cromwell.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{majority}} of specimens are almost or even totally black, (with the exception of head and facial markings), the color pattern may consist of a brown, gray, tan, yellowish-olive, or blackish ground color, which is overlaid {{with a series of}} 10–17 dark brown to almost black crossbands. These crossbands, which usually have black edges, are sometimes broken along the dorsal midline to form a series of staggered halfbands {{on either side of the}} body. These crossbands are visibly lighter in the center, almost matching the ground color, often contain irregular dark markings, and extend well down onto the ventral scales. The dorsal banding pattern fades with age, so older individuals are an almost uniform olive-brown, grayish-brown, or black. The belly is white, yellowish-white, or tan, marked with dark spots, and becomes darker posteriorly. The amount of dark pigment on the belly varies from virtually none to almost completely black. The head is a more or less uniform brown color, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>A.</b> p. piscivorus. Subadult specimens may exhibit the same kind of dark, parietal spots characteristic of A. contortrix, but sometimes these are still visible in adults. Eastern populations have a broad, dark, postocular stripe, bordered with pale pigment above and below, that is faint or absent in western populations. The underside of the head is generally whitish, cream, or tan.|$|E
