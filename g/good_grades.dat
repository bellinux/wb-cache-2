German was the language of instruction, but Kafka also spoke and wrote in Czech. He studied the latter at the gymnasium for eight years, achieving <b>good</b> <b>grades.</b> Although Kafka received compliments for his Czech, he never considered himself fluent in Czech, though he spoke German with a Czech accent. He completed his Matura exams in 1901.|$|E

5|$|Hamasaki was {{initially}} a good student, earning <b>good</b> <b>grades</b> {{in junior high}} school. Eventually, she lost faith in the curriculum, thinking that the subjects taught were of no use to her. Her grades worsened as she refused to put her mind to her studies. While living in Tokyo, she attempted to further her studies at Horikoshi Gakuen, a high school for the arts, but dropped {{out in the first}} year. Hamasaki did not attend school or have a job, so she spent much of her time shopping at Shibuya boutiques and dancing at Velfarre, an Avex-owned disco club.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Buczynski {{started at}} the Old School Elementary in Queens, where he made <b>good</b> <b>grades</b> and {{particularly}} enjoyed music, reading, drawing, and painting. In August 1954, his mother gave birth to his first brother, Frank, whom he would remain fond of despite the seven-year age gap. Although his family was Roman Catholic, he took an early interest in the pre-Christian religions of Ancient Egypt and Classical Greece, which he read about in books. He began devising and performing his own rituals to the deities of these religions, sparking his lifelong interest in Contemporary Paganism. His interest in Pagan religion only increased following his father's sudden death {{from a heart attack}} at age 31 in August 1958. His mother married Edward Nascato in 1961.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, {{at the age}} of 16, Einstein {{took the}} {{entrance}} examinations for the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination, but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics. On the advice of the principal of the Polytechnic, he attended the Argovian cantonal school (gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, in 1895–96 to complete his secondary schooling. While lodging with the family of professor Jost Winteler, {{he fell in love with}} Winteler's daughter, Marie. (Albert's sister Maja later married Winteler's son Paul.) In January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of Württemberg to avoid military service. In September 1896, he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly <b>good</b> <b>grades,</b> including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1–6. At 17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Zürich Polytechnic. Marie Winteler, who was a year older, moved to Olsberg, Switzerland, for a teaching post.|$|E

5|$|In 1924 Hepburn {{gained a}} place at Bryn Mawr College. She {{attended}} the institution primarily to satisfy her mother, who had studied there, and recalled disliking the experience. It {{was the first time}} she had been in school for several years, and she was self-conscious and uncomfortable with her classmates. She struggled with the scholastic demands of university, and once was suspended for smoking in her room. Hepburn was drawn to acting, but roles in college plays were conditional on <b>good</b> <b>grades.</b> Once her marks had improved, she began performing regularly. She performed the lead role in a production of The Woman in the Moon in her senior year, and the positive response it received cemented Hepburn's plans to pursue a theatrical career. She graduated with a degree in history and philosophy in June 1928.|$|E
5|$|Kapoor {{attended}} Jamnabai Narsee School in Mumbai, {{followed by}} Welham Girls' School in Dehradun. She attended the institution primarily to satisfy her mother, though later admitted to liking the experience. According to Kapoor, she wasn't inclined towards academics though received <b>good</b> <b>grades</b> {{in all her}} classes except mathematics. After graduating from Welham she studied commerce for two years at Mithibai College in Vile Parle (Mumbai). Kapoor then registered for a three-month summer course in microcomputers at Harvard Summer School in the United States. She later developed an interest in law, and enrolled at the Government Law College, Mumbai; during this period, she developed a long-lasting passion for reading. However, after completing her first year, Kapoor decided to pursue her interest to become an actress. She began training at an acting institute in Mumbai mentored by Kishore Namit Kapoor, {{a member of the}} Film and Television Institute of India (FTII).|$|E
5|$|During {{a family}} {{vacation}} to New York when Lawrence was 14, she was spotted on the street by a talent scout who arranged for her to audition for agents. Lawrence's mother was not keen on allowing her to pursue an acting career, but briefly moved {{to the city to}} let her read for roles. After Lawrence's first cold reading, the agents said that hers was the best they had heard from someone that young; Lawrence's mother convinced her that they were lying. Lawrence said her early experiences were difficult as she felt lonely and friendless. She signed on with the CESD Talent Agency, who convinced her parents to let her audition for roles in Los Angeles. Lawrence's mother agreed to let her pursue acting on the condition that she graduate from high school. Lawrence was eventually home-schooled in Los Angeles, and graduated two years early with <b>good</b> <b>grades.</b> Considering acting to be a natural fit for her, she turned down several offers for modelling assignments at the time. Between her acting jobs in the city, she made regular visits to Louisville, during which she served as an assistant nurse at her mother's camp.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{remains a}} {{proportion}} of patients with unfavorable outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, of particular relevance in those who present with a <b>good</b> clinical <b>grade.</b> A forewarning of those at risk provides an oppor-tunity towards more intensive monitoring, investigation, and prophylactic treatment prior to the clinical manifestation of advancing cerebral injury. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether biochemical markers sampled {{in the first days}} after the initial hemorrhage can predict poor outcome. METHODS: All patients recruited to the multicenter Simvastatin in Aneurysmal Hem-orrhage Trial (STASH) were included. Baseline biochemical profiles were taken between time of ictus and day 4 post ictus. The t-test compared outcomes, and a backwards stepwise binary logistic regression was used to determine the factors providing inde-pendent prediction of an unfavorable outcome. RESULTS: Baseline biochemical data were obtained in approximately 91 % of cases from 803 patients. On admission, 73 % of patients were <b>good</b> <b>grade</b> (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grades 1 or 2); however, 84 % had a Fisher grade 3 or 4 on computed tomographic scan. For patients presenting with <b>good</b> <b>grade</b> on admission, higher levels of C-reactive protein, glucose, and white blood cells and lower levels of hematocrit, albumin, and hemoglobin were associated with poor outcome at discharge. C-reactive protein was found to be an independent predictor of outcome for patients presenting in <b>good</b> <b>grade.</b> CONCLUSION: Early recording of C-reactive protein may prove useful in detecting those <b>good</b> <b>grade</b> patients who are at greater risk of clinical deterioration and poor outcome...|$|R

40|$|Let g be {{a complex}} simple Lie algebra and e a {{nilpotent}} element in g. To a certain nilpotent subalgebra m attached to e, called an admissible subalgebra of g, we associate an endomorphism algebra H. When m is constructed from a <b>good</b> <b>grading</b> for e, we recover the finite W-algebra associated to e {{and it is}} well-known that gr(H) is isomorphic to [S] as a graded Poisson algebra where S is the Slodowy slice of e and gr(H) is the graded algebra associated to the Kazhdan filtration. In this paper, we consider the case where g =_pn() and e consists of p Jordan blocks all {{of the same size}} n. Here, the only <b>good</b> <b>grading</b> for e is the Dynkin grading and we construct admissible subalgebras non isomorphic to the one derived from this <b>good</b> <b>grading.</b> For these algebras m, we prove that gr(H) is isomorphic to [S], generalizing Premet and Gan-Ginzburg's result in this particular case, where S denotes an analogue to the Slodowy slice.
