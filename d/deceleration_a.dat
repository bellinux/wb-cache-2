50|$|Improper {{engine braking}} {{technique}} {{can cause the}} wheels to skid (also called shift-locking), especially on slippery surfaces such as ice or snow, {{as a result of}} too much <b>deceleration.</b> <b>As</b> in a skid caused by overbraking, the vehicle will not regain traction until the wheels are allowed to turn more quickly. If the driver reduces engine braking by shifting back up, or disengaging the clutch on a manual transmission, traction can be regained.|$|R

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>deceleration</b> lane is <b>a</b> lane {{adjacent}} to the primary road or street used to improve traffic safety by allowing drivers {{to pull out of}} the through lane and decelerate safely before turning off a surface street or exiting a freeway.|$|R
50|$|It is {{intended}} to be used to help a spacecraft decelerate before landing on Mars. This is done by inflating the balloon around the vehicle to increase the surface area and create atmospheric drag. After sufficient <b>deceleration,</b> <b>a</b> parachute on a long tether deploys to further slow the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} improve {{stability}} under <b>deceleration,</b> <b>a</b> slipper clutch was added, with a center-cam-assist mechanism. The Honda Electronic Steering Damper was revised as well. Another significant change was the exhaust system, which {{was no longer a}} center-up underseat design. The new exhaust was a side-slung design in order to increase mass centralization and compactness while mimicking a MotoGP-style.|$|E
50|$|The {{diameter}} {{and length of}} the master cylinder has {{a significant effect on}} the performance of the brake system. A larger diameter master cylinder delivers more hydraulic fluid to the caliper pistons, yet requires more brake pedal force and less brake pedal stroke to achieve a given <b>deceleration.</b> <b>A</b> smaller diameter master cylinder has the opposite effect.|$|E

50|$|Early <b>Decelerations</b> are <b>a</b> {{result of}} {{increased}} vagal tone due to compression of the fetal head during contractions. Monitoring usually shows a symmetrical, gradual decrease {{and return to}} baseline of FHR which {{is associated with a}} uterine contraction. <b>A</b> 'gradual' <b>deceleration</b> has <b>a</b> time from onset to nadir of 30 seconds or more. Early decelerations begin and end at approximately the same time as contractions, and the low point of the fetal heart rate occurs {{at the peak of the}} contraction.|$|R
30|$|The {{approach}} function has {{to start}} <b>deceleration</b> at <b>an</b> appropriate distance {{so as not to}} induce any fear of collision in Target, for ensuring psychological security.|$|R
5000|$|Deceleration was {{measured}} by measuring the distance traveled (using {{what might be called}} a recording odometer or by distance markers placed along the track say every 50 meters), versus time. [...] A division of distance by time results in velocity and then the differences in velocities divided by time gives the <b>deceleration.</b> <b>A</b> sample data sheet shows time (in seconds) being recorded with 3 digits after the decimal point (thousandths of a second).|$|E
5000|$|But {{the general}} {{magnitudes}} of [...] required for separation are much greater for turbulent than for laminar flow, the former {{being able to}} tolerate nearly {{an order of magnitude}} stronger flow <b>deceleration.</b> <b>A</b> secondary influence is the Reynolds number. For a given adverse [...] distribution, the separation resistance of a turbulent boundary layer increases slightly with increasing Reynolds number. In contrast, the separation resistance of a laminar boundary layer is independent of Reynolds number — a somewhat counterintuitive fact.|$|E
5000|$|A {{decelerometer}} is a {{hand held}} device for measuring dynamic braking forces during a vehicle road test. A vehicle decelerometer operates {{as if it}} were, and {{it could also be}} known as, an accelerometer as it calculates braking efficiency by using those forces captured during a vehicle's <b>deceleration.</b> <b>A</b> decelerometer is a method by which braking effort can be accessed quickly and easily but it is generally used as an indicator to acceptable brake performance. Low efficiency readings should lead to further investigation on a roller brake tester.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the deceleration of Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) during their propagation from the Sun through interplanetary space, {{in the presence}} of weak to strong scattering in a Parker spiral configuration, using relativistic full orbit test particle simulations. The calculations retain all three spatial variables describing particles' trajectories, allowing to model any transport across the magnetic field. Large energy change is shown to occur for protons, due to the combined effect of standard adiabatic <b>deceleration</b> and <b>a</b> significant contribution from particle drift in the direction opposite to that of the solar wind electric field. The latter drift-induced deceleration is found to have a stronger effect for SEP energies than for galactic cosmic rays. The kinetic energy of protons injected at 1 MeV is found to be reduced by between 35 and 90 % after four days, and for protons injected at 100 MeV by between 20 and 55 %. The overall degree of <b>deceleration</b> is <b>a</b> weak function of the scattering mean free path, showing that, although adiabatic <b>deceleration</b> plays <b>a</b> role, a large contribution is due to particle drift. Current SEP transport models are found to account for drift-induced <b>deceleration</b> in <b>an</b> approximate way and their accuracy will need to be assessed in future work...|$|R

50|$|Target-type thrust {{reversal}} (also called Bucket Thrust Reversal) is <b>a</b> <b>deceleration</b> method when <b>an</b> aircraft lands. Like {{other types}} of thrust reversals, it temporarily divert the engine exhaust (thrust) forward to provide deceleration. This type of thrust-reverser is suitable for engines of 3,000 lbf kN or greater thrust.|$|R
50|$|Other {{causes of}} water hammer are pump failure and check valve slam (due to sudden <b>deceleration,</b> <b>a</b> check valve may slam shut rapidly, {{depending}} on the dynamic characteristic of the check valve and {{the mass of the}} water between a check valve and tank). To alleviate this situation, it is recommended to install non-slam check valves as they do not rely on gravity or fluid flow for their closure. For vertical pipes, other suggestions include installing new piping that can be designed to include air chambers to alleviate the possible shockwave of water due to excess water flow.|$|E
5000|$|Germany uses distant signals placed 1,000 m {{before the}} main signal. Trains with {{conventional}} brakes, decelerating at , can stop from 140 km/h in that distance. Trains with strong brakes, usually including electromagnetic track brakes, decelerating at [...] can stop from 160 km/h and {{are allowed to}} travel that speed. However, even with strong brakes and the same <b>deceleration,</b> <b>a</b> train traveling 200 km/h would require 1,543 m to stop, exceeding the signalling distance. Furthermore, as energy dissipated at a given acceleration increases with speed, higher speeds may require lower decelerations to avoid overheating the brakes, further increasing the distance.|$|E

50|$|If {{the poles}} A0 and A1 are {{energised}} then the rotor will align itself with these poles. Once this has occurred {{it is possible}} for the stator poles to be de-energised before the stator poles of B0 and B1 are energized. The rotor is now positioned at the stator poles b. This sequence continues through c before arriving back at the start. This sequence can also be reversed to achieve motion in the opposite direction. This sequence can be found to be unstable while in operation, under high load, or high acceleration or <b>deceleration,</b> <b>a</b> step can be missed, and the rotor jumps to wrong angle, perhaps going back one instead of forward three.|$|E
50|$|A key {{safety feature}} was a novel braking system that {{consisted}} of an automotive disc brakes attached to the vehicles driveshafts. These brakes were held off by hydraulic pressure that was present whenever the vehicle was connected with guideway power and the on-board controller was commanding them off. In the event of loss of electrical power, the hydraulic pressure holding the brakes was lost and springs inside the cylinders forced brake fluid into the calipers of the disc braking system, ensuring that the vehicles did not simply coast to a stop. In order to provide for a controlled <b>deceleration,</b> <b>a</b> pendulum valve was located {{in line with the}} brake actuation cylinders. Pendulums inside the valve reacted to the deceleration profile of the vehicle and would partially close, reducing the pressure in the brake lines and moderating the deceleration so that the emergency stop was not dangerously abrupt.|$|E
5000|$|Vipers {{typically}} use {{all three}} of their engines for powered flight, and can use a [...] "Turbo" [...] boost for greater speed, analogous to a modern fighter plane's afterburner. A pilot can turn on or off each engine by a push button, {{as seen in the}} startup sequence anytime a Viper is preparing to take off. Vipers can also reverse thrust for rapid <b>deceleration,</b> <b>a</b> useful tactic when being pursued by enemy ships that would then tend to overshoot the Viper, placing them in a vulnerable position. Vipers are capable of atmospheric as well as space flight, and can land and take off from a planetary surface. Viper engines are designed to collect commonly occurring gases in planetary atmospheres and in space to power the ship's fusion reactor. Vipers are also capable of supporting the pilot for up to two weeks in a form of [...] "suspended animation" [...] for extremely long missions.|$|E
50|$|Linear energy {{transfer}} is best defined for monoenergetic ions, i.e. protons, alpha particles, and the heavier nuclei called HZE ions found in cosmic rays or produced by particle accelerators. These particles cause frequent direct ionizations within a narrow diameter around a relatively straight track, thus approximating continuous <b>deceleration.</b> <b>As</b> they slow down, the changing particle cross section modifies their LET, generally increasing it to a Bragg peak just before achieving thermal equilibrium with the absorber, i.e., {{before the end}} of range. At equilibrium, the incident particle essentially comes to rest or is absorbed, at which point LET is undefined.|$|R

50|$|Feathered beaming shows {{a gradual}} {{change in the}} speed of notes. It is shown with a primary {{straight}} beam and other diagonal secondary beams (that together resemble a feather, hence the name). These secondary beams suggest a gradual acceleration or deceleration from the first note value within the feathered beam to the last. The longest value possible to show being the eighth note (quaver). When the number of notes played is not of interest, but rather the effect of acceleration or <b>deceleration,</b> <b>an</b> approximate number of headless stems are used.
