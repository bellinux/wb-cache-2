40|$|Study aim was {{to assess}} the {{applicability}} of a propose modification of the cardinal <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> graph by adding pain as the <b>fifth</b> <b>vital</b> <b>signs.</b> This exploratory descriptive study was conducted between May and June 2009 on a convenience sample of 40 nurses working in general surgery and orthopedic departments at King Khaled University University Hospital, Riyadh {{during the time of the}} study. Two assessment tools were used to collect data, namely an opinionaire form for nurses, and an audit sheet for nurses' application of the proposed modification. Nurses were informed about the use of the new graph, and their performance was assessed through auditing patients' proposed graphic chart three times for each of them. Results : Nurses' age ranged between 21 and 53 years,and their mean (SD) experience was 12. 9 (7. 2) years. The majority of the nurses agreed upon chart feasibility (72. 5 %), its positive impact on communication about pain (85. 0 %), and its consistency (97. 5 %). Overall, 87. 5 % of the nurses agreed upon the new change. Agreement was negatively and statistically significantly correlated to nurse age (r= - 0. 45, p= 0. 003) and experience years (r= - 0. 41, p= 0. 009). Auditing of patients' files revealed full application of the new change by 95. 0 % of the nurses for the graphic part, and hy 75. 0 % of them for the pain assessment part. In total, 75. 0 % of the nurses had full application of the change.

40|$|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} reasons for inadequate documentation of <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> in an electronic health record. BACKGROUND: Monitoring <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> is crucial to detecting and responding to patient deterioration. The ways in which <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> are documented in electronic health records have received limited attention in the research literature. A previous study revealed that <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> in an electronic health record were incomplete and inconsistent. DESIGN: Qualitative study. METHODS: Qualitative study. Data were collected by observing (68 hours) and interviewing nurses (n= 11) and doctors (n= 3), and analysed by thematic analysis to examine processes for measuring, documenting and retrieving <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> in four clinical settings in a 353 -bed hospital. RESULTS: We identified two central reasons for inadequate <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> documentation. First, there was an absence of firm guidelines for observing patients' <b>vital</b> <b>signs,</b> resulting in inconsistencies in the ways <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> were recorded. Second, there was a lack of adequate facilities in the electronic health record for recording <b>vital</b> <b>signs.</b> This led to poor presentation of <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> in the electronic health record and to staff creating paper 'workarounds'. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated inadequate routines and poor facilities for <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> documentation in an electronic health record, and makes an important contribution to knowledge by identifying problems and barriers that may occur. Further, it has demonstrated the need for improved facilities for electronic documentation of <b>vital</b> <b>signs.</b> RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: patient safety may have been compromised because of poor presentation of <b>vital</b> <b>signs.</b> Thus, our results emphasised the need for standardised routines for monitoring patients. In addition, designers should consult the clinical end-users in order to optimise facilities for electronic documentation of <b>vital</b> <b>signs.</b> This could have a positive impact on clinical practice and thus improve patient safety...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is an {{increasing}} concern of health institutions with patients' satisfaction. This study aimed at evaluating patients' satisfaction in the postoperative period of a medium-sized hospital in terms of controlling pain and implementing the concept of pain as the <b>fifth</b> <b>vital</b> <b>sign,</b> faced {{to the importance of}} the theme and the scarcity of prospective studies on the subject. METHOD: Open randomized clinical trial. Postoperative patients were divided in two groups. In the group with intervention, pain scales were made available to the assisting team and verbally informed when applied. For the group with no intervention, there were no pain scales. Satisfaction measurements were evaluated once a day until, at the utmost, the fifth postoperative day. RESULTS: There has been predominance of females (83. 5 %) and mean sample age was 36. 7 years. Most surgeries were C-sections (57. 1 %). Patients referred pain in 75. 6 % of measurements and considered it from moderate to severe in 23 % of measurements. As to satisfaction, most (54 %) have considered pain control excellent. In comparing groups there has been {{no significant difference in the}} level of satisfaction. CONCLUSION: There has been no difference in patients' satisfaction when pain as the <b>fifth</b> <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> was implemented. The study suggests that several components contribute to patients' satisfaction, although we have just evaluated the physiological aspect of pain...|$|E

40|$|Aim: {{to examine}} and explore factors that may {{influence}} the recording of <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> in adult patients within the initial 15 min and again within 60 min of arrival in the “resuscitation” and “major” areas of the emergency department (ED). Methods: a retrospective analysis of recording of <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> was performed on 400 consecutive sets of notes from adult patients presenting to the “major” or “resuscitation” areas of a district general hospital ED. The effect of staffing levels, triage category and attendances on the recording of <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> was examined using logistic regression. The main outcome measures were the proportion of patients with all <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> recorded within 15 min of arrival, the proportion of patients with all <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> repeated within 60 min of arrival and the outcomes of logistic regression analysis. Results: only 223 / 387 patients (58 %) had all <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> recorded within 15 min of arrival and only 29 / 387 (7 %) had all <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> repeated at 60 min. There was {{a significant relationship between}} the failure to record <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> and lower triage categories. There was no evidence that staffing levels or number of attendances predicted the recording of <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> within 15 min of arrival. Conclusion: recording of <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> was poor and unrelated to staffing levels or numbers of patients attending the ED.

40|$|BACKGROUND: NICE {{recommendations}} and evidence from ambulatory settings promotes {{the use of}} <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> in identifying serious infections in children. This appears to differ from usual clinical practice where GPs report measuring <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> infrequently. AIM: To identify frequency of <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> documentation by GPs, {{in the assessment of}} children with acute infections in primary care. DESIGN AND SETTING: Observational study in 15 general practice surgeries in Oxfordshire and Somerset, UK. METHOD: A standardised proforma was used to extract consultation details including documentation of numerical <b>vital</b> <b>signs,</b> and words or phrases used by the GP in assessing <b>vital</b> <b>signs,</b> for 850 children aged 1 month to 16 years presenting with acute infection. RESULTS: Of the children presenting with acute infections 31. 6 % had one or more numerical <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> recorded (269, 31. 6 %), however GP recording rate improved if free text proxies were also considered: at least one <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> was then recorded in over half (54. 1 %) of children. In those with recorded numerical values for <b>vital</b> <b>signs,</b> the most frequent was temperature (210, 24. 7 %), followed by heart rate (62, 7. 3 %), respiratory rate (58, 6. 8 %), and capillary refill time (36, 4. 2 %).

In the 1990 ’s there was a widespread impression that pain was undertreated. Whether this was true or an impression created by a few practitioners and undertreated patients is unclear. Nevertheless, the prevailing thought became that identifying and quantifying pain would lead to more appropriate pain therapy.
