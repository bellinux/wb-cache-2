40|$|The High-Energy Corona (HEC) {{technology}} for treating process offgases {{has been under}} development at Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) since 1991.

The plasma contains strong oxidants, possibly including hydroxyl <b>radicals,</b> <b>hydroperoxy</b> <b>radicals,</b> superoxide radicals, various excited as well as ionized forms of oxygen, high-energy electrons, and ultraviolet (UV) light. Because the high-voltage plasma is produced near ambient temperatures and pressures, yet exhibits extremely rapid destruction kinetics with relatively low power requirements, the HEC technique appears promising as a low-cost treatment technique (Virden et al. 1992).

In this work, the pyrolysis (φ = ∞) and oxidation (φ = 1 and 2) of 1, 5 -hexadiene, diluted in He, has been studied experimentally in a jet-stirred reactor at atmospheric pressure. The temperature was varied between 500 and 1100 K and the residence time was fixed at 2 s. Gas chromatography was used to determine the reactor effluent composition. The dedicated analysis section allowed the identification and quantification of many hydrocarbon and oxygenated product species up to naphthalene. The pyrolysis of 1, 5 -hexadiene results in the formation of small alkenes and cyclic hydrocarbons, with a particularly high selectivity towards 1, 3 -cyclopentadiene and benzene. In the presence of molecular oxygen, various oxygenated intermediates, including acrolein, prop- 2 -en- 1 -ol and but- 3 -enyl-oxirane, were detected in the outlet gases, besides the pyrolysis products. A detailed kinetic model was developed, mainly with an automatic network generation tool, to simulate and interpret the performed experiments. The kinetic model includes molecular weight growth chemistry to predict mole fractions of the main aromatic species. Model calculated and experimental mole fraction profiles are in relatively good agreement. At low-temperature pyrolysis conditions, 1, 5 -hexadiene is in quasi-equilibrium with allyl radicals. Hydrogen abstraction from 1, 5 -hexadiene by allyl radicals has the strongest effect on conversion. The resulting hexa- 2, 5 -dien- 1 -yl radical can react by intramolecular radical addition and eventually form 1, 3 -cyclopentadiene and benzene. Recombination of cyclopentadienyl with alkyl radicals followed by hydrogen abstraction and ring enlargement is an important formation path to aromatics. At oxidizing conditions, the pyrolysis reaction pathways are in competition with reactions involving hydroxyl and <b>hydroperoxy</b> <b>radicals,</b> as well as molecular oxygen. Above 900 K, 1, 5 -hexadiene is mainly consumed by C-C scission. The conversion and product distribution in 1, 5 -hexadiene oxidation are found to be sensitive to the branching ration of the reactions of allyl with <b>hydroperoxy</b> <b>radicals.</b> Formation of hydroxyl and allyloxy radicals increases the reactivity while the propene and molecular oxygen channel decreases the number of radicals in the system...|$|R

40|$|<b>Hydroperoxy</b> <b>radicals</b> (HO 2) play an {{important}} part in tropospheric photochemistry, yet photochemical models do not capture ambient HO 2 mixing ratios consistently. This is likely due to a combination of uncharacterized chemical pathways and measurement limitations. The indirect nature of current HO 2 measurements introduces challenges in accurately measuring HO 2; therefore a direct technique would help constrain HO x chemistry in the atmosphere. In this work we evaluate the feasibility of using chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) and propose a direct HO 2 detection scheme using bromide as a reagent ion. Ambient observations were made with a high-resolution time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-CIMS) in Atlanta over the month of June 2015 to demonstrate the capability of this direct measurement technique. Observations displayed expected diurnal profiles, reaching daytime median values of ∼[*] 5  ppt between 2 and 3  p. m. local time. The HO 2 diurnal profile was found to be influenced by morning-time vehicular NO x emissions and shows a slow decrease into the evening, likely from non-photolytic production, among other factors. Measurement sensitivities of approximately 5. 1  ±  1. 0  cps ppt − 1 for a bromide ion (79 Br −) count rate of 10 6  cps were observed.

Modelled and measured <b>hydroperoxy</b> <b>radical</b> concentrations agreed very well, with the model over-predicting on average by only 7 %.

Significant, unexplained OH reactivity was only observed during nights, when biomass burning of agricultural waste occurred on surrounding fields.

Applicable to both ground-based and aircraft platforms, the method provides good separation between HO 2 and RO 2 and frequent measurement capability with observations of both HO 2 and HO 2 + RO 2 amounts each minute. This allows for analyses of measured [HO 2]/[HO 2 + RO 2] ratios on timescales relevant to tropospheric photochemistry. By varying both [NO] and [O 2] simultaneously in the chemical conversion region of the PeRCIMS (Peroxy Radical CIMS) inlet, the method exploits the changing conversion efficiency of RO 2 to HO 2 under different inlet [NO]/[O 2] to selectively observe either primarily HO 2 or the sum of HO 2 and RO 2. Two modes of operation have been established for ambient measurements: {{in the first half}} of the minute, RO 2 radicals are measured at close to 100 % efficiency along with HO 2 radicals (low [NO]/[O 2] = 2. 53 × 10 − 5) and in the second half of the minute, HO 2 is detected while the majority of ambient RO 2 radicals are measured with approximately 15 % efficiency (high [NO]/[O 2] = 6. 80 × 10 − 4).

INHE undergoes similar heterogeneous chemistry as isoprene dihydroxy epoxide (IEPOX), likely contributing to atmospheric secondary organic aerosol formation...|$|E

The measurements were performed {{as a part of}} the EU project QUEST (Quantification of Aerosol Nucleation in the European Boundary layer) during an intensive field campaign, which was conducted in Hyyti 4 l 4, Finland in March–April 2003. In this paper, the closure between measured and calculated H 2 SO 4 concentrations is investigated. Besides that, also the contribution of sulphuric acid to nucleation mode particle growth rates is studied. Hydroxyl and <b>hydroperoxy</b> <b>radical</b> {{concentrations were}} determined using a pseudo steady state box model including photo stationary states. The maximum midday OH concentrations ranged between 4. 1 × 10 5 to 1. 8 × 10 6 molecules cm - 3 and the corresponding values for HO 2 were 1. 0 × 10 7 to 1. 5 × 10 8 molecules cm - 3. The dominant source term for hydroxyl radicals is the reaction of NO with HO 2 (56...|$|E

The experiment {{was one of the most}} highly instrumented to date. A combination of a large number of days of simultaneous, collocated measurements, a consequent wealth of model constraints and a highly detailed chemical mechanism, allowed the atmospheric chemistry of this site to be studied in detail. Between 25 July and 31 August, the concentrations of the hydroxyl radical and the <b>hydroperoxy</b> <b>radical</b> were measured using laser-induced fluorescence at low pressure and the sum of peroxy radicals was measured using the peroxy radical chemical amplifier technique. The concentrations of the radical species were predicted using a zero-dimensional box model based on the Master Chemical Mechanism version 3. 1, which was constrained with the observed concentrations of relatively long-lived species. The model included a detailed parameterisation to account for heterogeneous loss of hydroperoxy radicals onto aerosol particles. Quantilequantile plots were used to assess the model performance in respect of the measured radical concentrations. On average, measured hydroxyl radical concentrations were overpredicted by 24...|$|E
40|$|This study explores {{our ability}} to {{simulate}} the atmospheric chemistry stemming from isoprene emissions in pristine and polluted regions of the Amazon basin. We confront two atmospheric chemistry models – a global, Eulerian chemistry-climate model (UM-UKCA) and a trajectory-based Lagrangian model (CiTTyCAT) – with recent airborne measurements of atmospheric composition above the Amazon made during the SAMBBA campaign of 2012. The simulations with the two models prove relatively insensitive to the chemical mechanism employed; we explore one based on the Mainz Isoprene Mechanism, and an updated one that includes changes to the chemistry of first generation isoprene nitrates (ISON) and the regeneration of hydroxyl radicals via the formation of hydroperoxy-aldehydes (HPALDS) from <b>hydroperoxy</b> <b>radicals</b> (ISO 2). In the Lagrangian model, the impact of increasing the spatial resolution of trace gas emissions employed from 3. 75 ° × 2. 5 ° to 0. 1 ° × 0. 1 ° varies from one flight to another, and from one chemical species to another. What consistently proves highly influential on our simulations, however, is the model framework itself – how the treatment of transport, and consequently mixing, differs between the two models. The lack of explicit mixing in the Lagrangian model yields variability in atmospheric composition more reminiscent of that exhibited by the measurements. In contrast, the combination of explicit (and implicit) mixing in the Eulerian model removes much of this variability but yields better agreement with the measurements overall. We therefore explore a simple treatment of mixing in the Lagrangian model that, drawing on output from the Eulerian model, offers a compromise between the two models. We use this Lagrangian/Eulerian combination, {{in addition to the}} separate Eulerian and Lagrangian models, to simulate ozone at a site in the boundary layer downwind of Manaus, Brazil. The Lagrangian/Eulerian combination predicts a value for an AOT 40 -like accumulated exposure metric of around 1000 ppbv h, compared to just 20 ppbv h with the Eulerian model. The model framework therefore has considerable bearing on our understanding of the frequency at which, and the duration for which, the rainforest is exposed to damaging ground-level ozone concentrations...|$|R

40|$|Using quantum {{mechanical}} calculations, we {{have investigated}} hydrogen shift (H-shift) reactions in peroxy radicals {{derived from the}} atmospheric oxidation of 1 -pentene (CH_ 2 ═CHCH_ 2 CH_ 2 CH_ 3) and its monosubstituted derivatives. We investigate the peroxy radicals, HOCH_ 2 CH(OO) CR_ 1 HCH_ 2 CH_ 3, HOCH_ 2 CH(OO) CH_ 2 CR_ 1 HCH_ 3, and HOCH_ 2 CH(OO) CH_ 2 CH_ 2 CR_ 1 H_ 2, where the substituent R_ 1 is an alcoholic (OH), a hydroperoxy (OOH), or a methoxy (OCH_ 3) group. For peroxy radicals with an OOH substituent, the H-shift reaction from the hydrogen atom on the OOH group to the OO group is extremely fast. We find that the rate constants {{of this type of}} H-shift reactions are greater than 10 ^ 3 s^(– 1) for both the forward and the reverse reactions. It leads to the formation of two different radical isomers that react through different reaction mechanisms and yield different products. These very fast H-shift reactions are much faster than the reactions with NO and HO_ 2 under most atmospheric conditions and must be included in the atmospheric modeling of volatile organic compounds where <b>hydroperoxy</b> peroxy <b>radicals</b> are formed...|$|R
