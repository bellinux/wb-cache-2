Previous works which include a basic kinematic model <b>generate</b> <b>paths</b> that are only realistic at very low speed. By consider-ing higher vehicle speed during navigation, the vehicle can significantly deviate from the planned trajectory. Consequently, the planned path becomes unusable for the mission achievement. So, to bridge a gap between planning and navigation, we propose a realistic path planner based on a dynamic vehicle model. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} a searching algorithm for <b>generating</b> <b>path</b> of a mobile robot. The method is inspired by the behaviour-based paradigm approach to robotics architecture, in which the searching algorithm employs Laplacian Behaviour-Based Control (LBBC) during space exploration of the environment. The LBBC {{make use of the}} potential function in the configuration space to guide its exploration. Laplace’s equation was used to represent the potential function in the configuration space of the robot. Consequently, the gradient of the potential function would be used by the searching algorithm to <b>generate</b> <b>path</b> from starting to goal location. In complex environment, however, it suffers from the occurrence of flat region with no appreciable gradient, which result in the difficulty for the searching algorithm to <b>generate</b> <b>path.</b> The LBBC would enable the searching algorithm to <b>generate</b> <b>path</b> successfully even with the occurrence of this flat region. In this paper, the solution to Laplace’s equation is calculated with block iteration via Explicit Group Successive Over-Relaxation via Nine-Point Laplacian (EGSOR 9 L) iterative method for rapid computation compared to the traditional Gauss-Seidel iteration and standard SOR...|$|R

40|$|In finite perfect {{information}} extensive (FPIE) games, backward induction (BI) {{gives rise}} to all pure-strategy subgame perfect Nash equilibria, and iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies (IEWDS) may give different outcomes for different orders of elimination. Several conjectures were recently posed {{in an effort to}} better understand the relationship between BI and IEWDS in FPIE games. Four of these problems regard binary voting agendas with sequential voting and two alternatives. Those problems are: (1) Assuming no indifferences, is the BI strategy profile, "always vote for my preferred alternative", guaranteed to survive IEWDS using exhaustive elimination? (2) Does any order of IEWDS leave only strategy profiles that <b>generate</b> <b>paths</b> of play consistent with BI? (3) Does there exist an order of IEWDS that leaves only strategy profiles that <b>generate</b> <b>paths</b> of play consistent with BI? (4) Does any order of IEWDS leave at least one strategy profile that generates a path of play consistent with BI? This paper proves all four conjectures. Moreover, the first conjecture is generalized to agendas with indifferences, the second and third conjectures are shown to not hold for binary voting agendas with more than two alternatives, and I comment on additional results related to the last three problems...|$|E

40|$|Many popularly studied recursions in {{deductive}} databases can be compiled {{into one}} or a set of highly regular chain <b>generating</b> <b>paths,</b> each of which consists of {{one or a}} set of connected predicates. Previous studies on chain-based query evaluation in deductive databases take a chain <b>generating</b> <b>path</b> as an inseparable unit in the evaluation. However, some recursions, especially many functional recursions whose compiled chain consists of infinitely evaluable function(s), should be evaluated by chain-split evaluation, which splits a chain <b>generating</b> <b>path</b> into two portions in the evaluation: an immediately evaluable portion and a delayed-evaluation portion. In this paper, the necessity of chain-split evaluation is examined from the points of view of both efficiency and finite evaluation, and three chain-split evaluation techniques: magic sets, buffered evaluation and partial evaluation, are developed.

We also define a sequence distance which measures the amount of change needed to convert the <b>generated</b> <b>path</b> into the desired path.

FDB is widely used by the Army {{and needs to be}} applied to all weapon systems of newly developed. For the autonomous navigation of a robot, it is necessary to <b>generate</b> a <b>path</b> planning map by which a global path can be optimized. First, data included in FDB is analyzed in order to identify meaningful layers and attributes of which information can be used to <b>generate</b> the <b>path</b> planning map.

For a certain region that is gridded, i. e., represented by a grid map, the traverse cost is extracted in a automatic manner for each gird of the region to <b>generate</b> the <b>path</b> planning map. Since multiple layers may be included in a single grid, an algorithm is developed to fusion several traverse costs. The proposed method is tested using a experimental program.
