50|$|In 1907 the {{construction}} of <b>holding</b> <b>yards</b> was authorised. They were located {{to the east of}} the main line, north of the Eketahuna station yard {{on the other side of}} Alfredton Road. This space was divided into three parts and was a short distance from the existing stockyards at the north end of the station yard on the south side of the road. The water supply was extended to the <b>holding</b> <b>yards</b> in 1928 using the Department’s own water source, and a pen suitable for holding pigs was added in 1930.|$|R
50|$|Narrower logs {{were also}} {{processed}} through the frame saw. Vertical saws {{contained within the}} frame cut a number of boards simultaneously, with the feed grips of the frame adjusting automatically to the taper of the log. A planing machine for further processing was originally located in the north-eastern corner of the mill, but was later removed. Once cut to the desired specification, the sawn timber was transported on trolleys aligned to rail lines into the <b>holding</b> <b>yard</b> at {{the eastern end of}} the mill to season.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} {{equipped}} with three platform faces: the main station platform was used for down trains, whilst {{the far side of}} an island platform served the up trains. A double track ran through the station, with a third line splaying out {{to the other side of}} the island before merging once again with the line to Tunbridge Wells. Four sets of goods sidings lay to the north of the main station serving a carriage dock, blacksmith's shop and stable. The extensive goods yard and generous facilities did not, however, see much use, and the Southern Railway used the station as a collection point for empty wagons and, at one point, as a <b>holding</b> <b>yard</b> for Tunbridge-bound trains.|$|E
50|$|When {{the loading}} race was {{destroyed}} in a shunting accident in 1955 it was proposed to close the station to all goods traffic {{on account of the}} low volume handled there. This move was delayed, at first by a desire to retain the loop for train crossing purposes should that be required by a change in traffic patterns brought about by the Rimutaka Tunnel, and later by objections from local farmers. The farmers wanted to construct a permanent cattle yard and extend the existing sheep <b>holding</b> <b>yard</b> to increase their throughput at the station. The Department was agreeable to the proposal on the understanding that goods traffic at the station would increase, and supplied the materials to the farmers who carried out the work, completed in 1959.|$|E

5000|$|Regular rail {{services}} to Mungana ceased in 1958 and only extended beyond Chillagoe {{when they were}} required for cattle. The end of rail services was the final blow to Mungana and by 1959 it had shrunk to a hotel, store, post office and seven residents. A new metal cattle <b>holding</b> <b>yard</b> for road haulage {{were built in the}} 1970s and the old wooden cattle yards became derelict. Today the Mungana Township is completely abandoned and has become a tourism destination, although some mining leases have been recently reactivated over parts of the site and a new [...] "drive" [...] zinc mine is being established. The powder magazine and detonator shed are the only extant buildings but substantial remnants of the rail network, building foundations, stock trucking yards, and mining operations and cemetery survive.|$|E
50|$|The {{central core}} of the cattle yards {{comprises}} crushes for de-horning, cutting, drafting, dipping, and branding. Surrounding the stock working facilities of the central core, are the receiving, forcing and holding yards. The de-horning and cutting crush, cattle dip and stock loading ramp are in better condition than most sections of the yards, possibly through having remained in use and repair until {{the closure of the}} station. The loading ramp was built in the early 1960s and is the most recent structure. The most substantial feature of the yards is the cattle dip, which is of the conventional design and construction. The dip was built during the O'Beirne's tenure and is the earliest surviving structure within the yards. The walls of the dip are of concrete with concrete rendered steps and pit. Bush timber uprights and rafters support a corrugated iron roof that covers the dip itself. Steps lead out of the dip to a concrete-surfaced draining and pound yard. Beyond the dip is a large circular <b>holding</b> <b>yard</b> over 50 metres in diameter which forms a significant feature of the stockyards.|$|E

50|$|The Bicentennial National Trail {{for walking}} and horse riding passes from Cedar Creek {{on the edge}} of Werrikimbe National Park past Youdales Hut via East Kunderang to Georges Junction on the Armidale to Kempsey road, which is a {{distance}} of some 75 km through the national park. The track is mostly unmarked but follows Kunderang Brook as it descends into the Macleay past East Kunderang Homestead in Oxley Wild Rivers National Park. The walk takes at least five days and all food and equipment has to be carried and there are numerous creek and river crossings, with some steep ascents and descents. This route generally takes at least four days to ride, and can be impassable after rain - check with Armidale or Walcha NPWS for details. Huts at Left Hand and Middle Yards are managed for their cultural heritage value, but are available for use while on the National Trail. The historic, remote Middle Yards Hut, located on Kunderang Brook deep within Oxley Wild Rivers National Park, has been restored to its original condition by the NPWS. A <b>holding</b> <b>yard</b> for horse trekkers was constructed here, along with a hitching rail, period furniture inside the hut, an outdoor barbecue and new water tank. Horses are not permitted at East Kunderang homestead.|$|E
50|$|In {{the centre}} of the front curved wall is a central {{double-door}} entry that is met by the <b>holding</b> <b>yard</b> ramp. The sliding doors are rectangular and clad entirely in corrugated iron. Ten smaller sliding ventilation shutters of similar design are evenly spaced in the curved facade, five {{on either side of the}} double doors. At the rear ground level of the woolshed is another central double sliding door, clad in corrugated iron.Internally, the woolshed has two levels - the main floor, high-set, of timber construction, and semi-circular; and a much smaller ground level floor, of concrete, along the rear, straight wall. There are no internal wall or roof linings, leaving the shed structural components clearly visible. The woolshed has a steel superstructure, with a central pillar that sits directly under the apex of the roof; located at the mid-rear point of the top roof tier. Steel web trusses radiate out from the central pillar over a clear space of 70 feet (21.3 metres). The trusses terminate at supporting steel posts, which frame the 52 shearing bays that follow the curve of the semicircle. Mechanical shearing motors are mounted on the tally boards above each bay, with smaller holding pens located between the bays and the exterior wall. The current motors are modern upgrades but an example of an original motor survives within the shed. The large open space between the central pillar and the bays was used to sort and class the fleeces. Wool presses are located on the rear edge of the timber floor and extend down to the narrow concrete ground level.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{relationship}} between bulk tank somatic cell count (SCC) and farm management and infrastructure was examined {{using data from}} 398 randomly selected, yet representative, Irish dairy farms where the basal diet is grazed grass. Median bulk tank SCC for the farms was 282, 887 cells/ml ranging from 82, 209 to 773, 028 cells/ml. Two questionnaires were administered through face-to-face contact with each farmer. Herd-level factors associated with bulk tank SCC were determined using linear models with annual somatic cell score (i. e., arithmetic mean of the natural logarithm of bulk tank SCC) included as the dependent variable. All herd level factors were analysed individually in separate regression models, which included an adjustment for geographical location of the farm; a multiple regression model was subsequently developed. Management practices associated with low SCC included the use of dry cow therapy, participation in a milk recording scheme {{and the use of}} teat disinfection post-milking. There was an association between low SCC and an increased level of hygiene and frequency of cleaning of the <b>holding</b> <b>yard,</b> passageways and cubicles. Herd management factors associated with bulk tank SCC in Irish grazing herds are generally in agreement with most previous studies from confinement systems of milk production. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLameness is a {{significant}} welfare concern for dairy farmers and a major contributing economic loss to the dairy industry. Information is limited on environmental and managerial risk factors associated with lameness in Australian dairy herds. The objective {{of this study was}} to explore and quantify the environmental and management risk factors associated with lameness in pasture-based dairy herds. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 63 pasture-based dairy herds between 2011 and 2014, where all lactating cows were locomotion scored (scale 1 – 4) during a single visit. Environmental and management variables, such as length of main track and animal handling practices, were recorded during the visit. The prevalence of lameness was measured for each farm and associated risk factors were analyzed using a Generalized Linear Model, where farm was the unit of analysis. Estimated average prevalence of lameness was 18. 9 % (range 5 to 44. 5 %). The prevalence of lameness was associated with the amount of rainfall during the 30 d before the farm assessment, smoothness of concrete surface and available space per cow in the <b>holding</b> <b>yard,</b> and length of feed-pad available per cow. Inappropriate handling of cows on the track (e. g., causing sideways pushing among cows) was also a contributing risk factor to high prevalence of lameness in these dairy herds. The findings of this study suggest that by managing several environmental and farming practices, producers can reduce the prevalence of lameness, leading to improved productivity of their herds...|$|E
40|$|An {{intensive}} {{monitoring program}} {{of a standard}} two-stage dairy shed waste stabilisation pond system was undertaken to determine the incidence and extent of spatial and temporal variation of basic physio-chemical parameters, and {{to shed light on}} the longer term dynamic nature of in-pond conditions. The anaerobic-facultative pond system, located in a remote rural area, treats wastewater from the hosing down and hydraulic flushing of the milking parlour and <b>holding</b> <b>yard</b> at the farm dairy shed. A number of multi-parameter water quality field monitoring probes were permanently deployed at various locations within the two ponds to enable continuous measurement of temperature, pH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen. In addition, profiling of the supernatant of both ponds was undertaken at different times of the year to examine vertical variation of the same parameters. Continuous monitoring revealed spatial homogeneity in EC and pH levels in the upper metre of both ponds. Physio-chemical parameters also appear to change uniformly across the ponds in response to external stimuli such as rainfall. Neither pond, however, exhibits homogeneity down the profile of the supernatant. Seasonal stratification is prevalent in the facultative pond suggesting poor vertical mixing, while the anaerobic pond is notably affected by sludge accumulation. A long-term pattern of rising conductivity in both ponds indicated accumulation of dissolved salt species in the system due to recirculation of reclaimed effluent for hydraulic flushing of the dairy shed. In the facultative pond, diurnal fluctuations in dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reduction potential and turbidity during warmer months of the year closely followed temperature swings. The extensive data collected in this study provides a detailed picture of the physio-chemical dynamics of two-stage stabilisation pond systems treating dairy shed wastewater...|$|E
40|$|The social {{motivation}} of a grazing individual {{to remain in}} close proximity to its peer is dependent on many factors, particularly the level of familiarity with its peers and the desire to forage further away. This study examined the trade-off individual cattle have to make between a food reward and maintaining close proximity to a peer with which they are either familiar or unfamiliar. Two unfamiliar groups of 12 Brahman steers were individually tested in a 30 m × 140 m grassed arena with an adjoining <b>holding</b> <b>yard</b> containing the peer. During the without-food test, no food was provided to motivate individuals to move away from their peer. In the with-food tests, 13 food bowls containing 250 g of pelleted grain were placed at 10 m increments {{directly in front of the}} penned animal. Every individual from each group was paired with both a familiar and unfamiliar peer during the without-food and with-food test phases and their distances and behaviour were recorded for 30 min. The mean distance travelled from the penned steer was higher in the with-food test than the without-food test for steers paired with both familiar and unfamiliar peers, indicating that the food source provided the motivation to move away from the penned steer. Steers paired with familiar peers had more bowl visits (familiar = 12. 0 ± 1. 24 bowl visits, unfamiliar 7. 5 ± 1. 22 bowl visits, P = 0. 014) and visited bowls at a greater rate (familiar: 22. 6 ± 3. 27 % time bowl visiting, unfamiliar 12. 6 ± 3. 13 % time bowl visiting, P = 0. 033) compared to steers paired with unfamiliar peers. It was concluded that familiarity does affect an individual's decision to move away from a peer to forage; steers are more willing to move away from a familiar peer to seek a food reward than with an unfamiliar peer...|$|E

40|$|It is {{apparent}} that present dairyshed effluent treatment systems are not capable of complying with regulations generated by Regional Councils implementing the Resource Management Act 1991. This has created a need for research into dairyshed effluent treatment. To develop an improved treatment system for dairyshed effluent, research was conducted with two main study objectives; to characterise effluent from the dairyshed <b>holding</b> <b>yard</b> and anaerobic pond, {{and to develop a}} sequencing batch reactor (SBR) for the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus. The carbon characterisation showed that there was a large difference between dairyshed effluent and domestic effluent in the proportion of carbon in each fraction. When treating dairyshed wastewater to reduce BOD, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations {{it was not possible to}} treat either the yard effluent or the anaerobic effluent without addition of external materials. The BOD reaction rate constant for the yard effluent at 0. 2 d - 1 was similar to a typical domestic wastewater value of 0. 23 d - 1. The anaerobic pond effluent BOD reaction rate constant of 0. 16 d - 1 was lower than the yard effluent value indicating that the anaerobically treated effluent was hard to treat aerobically. A pilot scale SBR treating dairyshed effluent was operated for 75 days. Startup procedure used a 50 / 50 mixture of anaerobic pond and aerobic pond effluents which was successful in establishing a biomass capable of nitrifying anaerobic pond effluent. The startup time to establish a nitrifying population was 17 days. The sludge was found to settle well, with a maximum sludge volume index of 54 ml/g measured during the SBR operation. Sludge bulking was not seen as a problem. Nitrification performance a large proportion of the bacteria were lost took only 5 days to recover. With the addition of alkalinity nitrification reliably reduced the effluent ammonia concentration to 5 mg/l. From the cycle analysis the first order reaction rate constants for nitrification were; ammonia reduction 0. 7 hr - 1, TKN reduction 0. 4 hr - 1 and nitrate formation 0. 2 hr - 1. These constants could be used in future work to optimise stage times.
