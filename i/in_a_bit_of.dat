Even in Bordeaux, which was still using lagars long after Burgundy, Champagne and other French wine regions had adopted the basket press, saw the use of a wine press become more popular after darker, more full bodied wines of Ho-Bryan produced by Lord Arnaud III de Pontac began receive wide acclaim from English writers such as Jonathan Swift, John Locke and Samuel Pepys. By the end of the 18th century, nearly all prestigious Bordeaux wine estates were following de Pontac's method of giving the grapes more time to ferment in the vat and then using a basket press on the darker vin vermeilh and pressing it into new oak barrels.|$|E

500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today {{felt the}} show benefited from not {{being picked up}} by ABC, where {{it would have been}} in the shadow of Desperate Housewives, and from being {{scheduled}} as summer television, where its competition was weak.

Dong said Akane is an appealing main character who is [...] "worth paying attention to, and her presence on screen is the perfect complement to the much more complex side characters that populate the show". Richard Eisenbeis from Kotaku said he found Akane more interesting than Kogami because her overall development. In anticipation for the movie, IGN writer Miranda Sanchez expected to see more interactions between Kogami and Akane due to Psycho-Pass 2 lacking that. However, she noted this bond was not fully explored. Jacob Chapman enjoyed her interactions with Kogami in the role such as one dialogue where Akane starts comparing Kogami with the late villain Makishima.
