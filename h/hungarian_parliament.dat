5|$|The Volksdeutsche of the {{occupied}} territories were {{an important part of}} the economies of {{the occupied}} territories, and by 1941, they were entirely in the thrall of the Nazi Party. Relations between the occupation authorities and the Volksdeutsche were strained by the killing of ethnic Germans during the invasion, to the extent that Adolf Hitler became aware of the issue. The Volksdeutsche were not active in the Hungarian military or civil administration, but were represented in the <b>Hungarian</b> <b>Parliament,</b> and from 1942 were permitted to conscript their members into the Wehrmacht. The official organisation of the Volksdeutsche in Hungary, the Volksbund der Deutschen in Ungarn (National League of Germans in Hungary), was essentially autonomous during the war, including within the occupied territories.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} ships were {{built at the}} Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino yard, Trieste. As a {{condition}} of agreeing to the construction and financing of the new fleet, the <b>Hungarian</b> <b>parliament</b> insisted {{that one of the}} battleships be built at the Hungarian facility, the Danubius yard at Fiume. However, the Danibius shipyard had until then never built anything larger than a destroyer. So construction was delayed as the yard was extended in preparation for the dreadnought. For this reason the final ship, delivered seventeen months late, was given a Hungarian name: Szent István ("Saint Stephen", after Stephen I, the first king and patron saint of Hungary.|$|E

50|$|Montecuccoli {{found his}} efforts to {{modernize}} the fleet impeded by chronic domestic political friction in the annual budget debate of the Reichstag, which was composed of 60-member delegations from the Austrian and <b>Hungarian</b> <b>parliaments.</b> Faced with Italian {{plans to build a}} dreadnought battleship, Montecuccoli on 20 February 1908 announced Austria-Hungary's intention to build such vessels. The design was accepted on 27 April 1909; Montecuccoli thought the necessary funds could be obtained in the 1910 budget, to be debated in October 1909. He suggested that Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) and Škoda should begin construction of the ships and guns on their own account until the naval budget was adopted.|$|R

5|$|The Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912 and the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913 {{significantly}} increased tensions in Europe, which saw the dismemberment of large swaths of the Ottoman Empire. These conflicts provided the background {{for a major}} naval expansion program in Austria-Hungary, which received broad support in the Austrian and <b>Hungarian</b> <b>parliaments.</b> Admiral Anton Haus, then the Marinekommandant (Navy Commander) used the growing risk of war with Austria-Hungary's nominal ally, Italy, to push his construction program. As part of its construction program, the navy projected to build three cruisers, and adopted a secret construction schedule on 12 January 1914, which called for the first vessel to be laid down on 1 July 1914, followed by the other two on 1 July 1915.

On February 12, 1991 the Slovak National Council formally apologized for postwar persecution of innocent Germans, rejecting the principle of collective guilt. In 2003, speaker of the Slovak parliament Pavol Hrušovský said that Slovakia was ready to apologize for postwar injustices if Hungary would do likewise. Although Hungarian National Assembly Speaker Katalin Szili approved his initiative, further steps were not taken. In 2005 Mikloško apologized for injustices on his own, and similar unofficial apologies were made by representatives of both sides.|$|R

Beyond the obvious answer – that they failed to win enough votes – five factors involve particularly high political risk for political parties. Two system-level factors are somewhat beyond the control of the smaller parties: changes in the salience of cleavages and the electoral system.

25|$|This rise in antisemitic attacks is {{associated}} {{on the one}} hand with the Muslim antisemitism (described below) {{and on the other hand}} with the rise of far-right political parties as a result of the economic crisis of 2008. The number of antisemitic political parties in European parliaments rose from 1 to 3 during 2012 and a survey in 10 European countries revealed high levels of antisemitic attitudes. In June, Greece's neo-Nazi party, Golden Dawn, won 21 seats in parliament. In November, the radical Svoboda (Freedom) party of Ukraine captured more than 10% of the popular vote, giving electoral support to a party well known for its antisemitic rhetoric. They joined the ranks of Jobbik, an openly antisemitic party, in the <b>Hungarian</b> <b>parliament.</b> This rise in the support for far right ideas in western and eastern Europe has resulted in the increase of antisemitic acts, mostly attacks on Jewish memorials, synagogues and cemeteries but also a number of physical attacks against Jews.|$|E
25|$|Emmanuil Hrabar (1830–1910), {{father of}} Igor Grabar {{and his older}} {{brothers}} Bela and Vladimir (the future law scholar, 1865–1956), was an ethnic Rusyn lawyer and a politician of pro-Russian orientation. A strong critic of magyarization of Rusyns in Subcarpathian Rus, {{he was elected to}} the <b>Hungarian</b> <b>Parliament</b> in 1869, at the same time maintaining ties with slavophiles in Moscow and the Russian Embassy. Olga Hrabar (1843–1930), mother of Igor and Vladimir, was a daughter of Rusyn pro-Russian, anti-Catholic politician Adolph Dobryansky (1817–1901). According to Igor Grabar's memoirs, Dobryansky ran an underground network of obedient followers; the 1869 election was merely a means of shielding his son-in-law from prosecution. Dobryansky and his group, unaware of the realities of living in the Russian Empire, leaned to its official doctrine of Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality; Dobryansky, a man of wealth and pedigree, even imitated the lifestyle of a Russian landlord in minute details; two of his sons joined Imperial Russian service. Dobryansky praised the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 by Russian troops, dreaded by his own Rusyn peasants.|$|E
50|$|The {{military}} {{system of}} the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was similar in both states, and rested since 1868 upon {{the principle of the}} universal and personal obligation of the citizen to bear arms. Its military force was composed of the common army; the special armies, namely the Austrian Landwehr, and the Hungarian Honved, which were separate national institutions, and the Landsturm or levy-en masse. As stated above, the common army stood under the administration of the joint minister of war, while the special armies were under the administration of the respective ministries of national defence. The yearly contingent of recruits for the army was fixed by the military bills voted on by the Austrian and <b>Hungarian</b> <b>parliaments,</b> and was generally determined {{on the basis of the}} population, according to the last census returns. It amounted in 1905 to 103,100 men, of which Austria furnished 59,211 men, and Hungary 43,889. Besides 10,000 men were annually allotted to the Austrian Landwehr, and 12,500 to the Hungarian Honved. The term of service was two years (three years in the cavalry) with the colours, seven or eight in the reserve and two in the Landwehr; in the case of men not drafted to the active army the same total period of service was spent in various special reserves.|$|R
