40|$|Abstract. Reliability of {{rotating}} machinery {{is determined to}} a considerable degree by the <b>bearing</b> <b>units.</b> For several applications the requirements in rotation speed, bearing load and maximal vibration level are so extreme that neither rolling-element bearings nor fluid-film bearings could provide necessary performance characteristics during all regimes of operation. Hybrid bearings, which are a combination of rolling-element and fluid-film bearings, can improve performance characteristics and reliability of the rotor-bearing systems. The aim of this work is to analyze {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the hybrid bearings. Known real applications of hybrid bearings are discussed. Analysis shows that depending on the application different hybrid bearing types could improve dynamic characteristics and life time of the <b>bearing</b> <b>unit,</b> increase load capacity and DN limit of the rolling-element bearing. 1...|$|R

40|$|In Scandinavian tonology {{two views}} exist {{with respect to}} how tones are {{associated}} with the segmental string. The first is the orthodox, autosegmental view that all tones are autosegmentally associated with a tone <b>bearing</b> <b>unit,</b> which must be either a syllable or a mora, subject to dialect variation. Most recent analyses of Norwegian tonal accent are based on this premise. The second is the view first proposed by Bruce (1987) that only stressed syllables should be counted as tone <b>bearing</b> <b>units</b> in Swedish and Norwegian, a view that entails that other tones will be left either floating or concatenated with the linked tone. They are thereby left indirectly associated with the segmental string. In this article, data from Norwegian are discussed that suggest that the more canonical autosegmental view is correct, at least for the dialects under discussion...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the high}} cutting speeds and depths of modern milling {{machines}} vibrations are generated within the whole machine structure.

40|$|ABSTRACT. - In the Bigadiç volcano-sedimentary basin, Palaeozoic-Mesozoic {{basement}} {{rocks are}} overlain unconformably by the Miocene rock units. The straligraphic sequence of Miocene units, {{from the bottom}} to the top in ascending order is, basement volcanic unit, basement limestone unit, lower tuff <b>unit,</b> lower borate <b>bearing</b> <b>unit,</b> upper tuff <b>unit,</b> upper borate <b>bearing</b> <b>unit,</b> and basalt unit. Miocene units are over-lain unconformably by the recent sediments, and alluvium rests unconformably on the recent sediments. In the region, Palaeozoic and Meso-zoic basement rocks were subjected to block faulting and dislocation during the pre-Miocene. As {{a result of these}} movements, large and small sized several playa lake type sedimentation basins were formed, and Miocene sediments were deposited in these basins. In the study area, the general strike of the fold axis is NE-SW. Beds generally dip towards MW or SE with 5 °- 35 °. Borate deposits occur as two different horizons in the upper and lower borate <b>bearing</b> <b>units,</b> which are separated from each other by the upper tuff unit. In the region, the lower and upper borate zones show thickness varying between 35 - 130 meters and 20 - 110 meters, respectively. Boron ores are alternated with clay-stone, mudstone, tuff and thin-bedded limestone, and generally exhibit lenticular structures. Colemanite and ulexite are the dominant ore minerals in both of the ore zones. In addition to these, other boron minerals such as pandermite, probertite, howlite, tunellite, meyerhoffente, hydroboracite and inyoite have also been determined in the basin. Colemanite in the lower and upper borate zones have possibly precipitated directly from the solutions contemporaneous with sedimentation, within the unconsolidated sediments under the sediment/water interface. Nodules continued to develop, parallel to the compaction of sediments. Formation of ulexite resembles that of colemanite and it reflects the period when Na-concentration of the solution has increased...|$|R
