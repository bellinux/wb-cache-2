2500|$|For the 2001 model year, a {{redesigned}} coupe {{version of}} the TL was introduced, the 3.2CL. While it was mechanically identical to the TL, its sales never came close to that of its sibling model, and as a result, it was discontinued in May 2003.

2500|$|In {{the second}} year of production, the Acura TL was given {{slightly}} more features, including a 5-speed automatic transmission with SportShift. The added gear allowed for slightly better fuel economy and acceleration when compared to the previous 4-speed automatic transmission with SportShift. With this model, if the driver forgets the 1-2 shift the computer will take over when in sport mode and do the 1-2 up and down shifts, unlike the 4-speed 1999 model. In many vehicles, the 5-speed automatic transmission failed: as the third clutch pack wore, particles blocked off oil passages and prevented the transmission from shifting or holding gears normally. The transmission would slip, fail to shift, or suddenly downshift and make the car come to a screeching halt, even at freeway speeds. This problem was highlighted in the Los Angeles Times in September 2002. Consumer Reports took note and gave the TL and CL the black spot, the worst rating for transmission reliability. In response to the recurring problem, the manufacturer extended the warranty covering the transmission to 7 yrs or [...] on U.S.A. models. A class-action lawsuit was settled to extend the transmission warranty for U.S.A. owners or entities to 7.75 years for all models made from 1998 to 2002 and some 2003 models by VIN; however, Canadian owners warranties were not extended.

2500|$|Whilst {{the motor}} vehicle is {{stationary}} and in neutral (N), the driver can select D for drive (after first pressing the foot brake pedal). The transmission's reverse gear is selected {{on the first}} shaft K1, and the outer clutch K2 engages {{at the start of}} the bite point. At the same time, on the alternate gear shaft, the reverse <b>gear</b> <b>clutch</b> K1 is also selected (pre-selected), as the gearbox doesn't know whether the driver wants to go forward or reverse. The clutch pack for second gear (K2) gets ready to engage. When the driver releases the brake pedal, the K2 clutch pack increases the clamping force, allowing the second gear to take up the drive through an increase of the bite point, and thereby transferring the torque from the engine through the transmission to the drive shafts and road wheels, causing the vehicle to move forward. Depressing the accelerator pedal engages the clutch and causes an increase of forward vehicle speed. Pressing the throttle pedal to the floor (hard acceleration) will cause the gearbox to [...] "kick down" [...] to first gear to provide the acceleration associated with first, although there will be a slight hesitation while the gearbox deselects second gear and selects first gear. As the vehicle accelerates, the transmission's computer determines when the second gear (which is connected to the second clutch) should be fully used. Depending on the vehicle speed and amount of engine power being requested by the driver (determined by the position of the throttle pedal), the DSG then up-shifts. During this sequence, the DSG disengages the first outer clutch whilst simultaneously engaging the second inner clutch (all power from the engine is now going through the second shaft), thus completing the shift sequence. This sequence happens in 8milliseconds (aided by pre-selection), and can happen even with full throttle opening, and as a result, there is virtually no power loss.|$|E

50|$|The 01M and its {{predecessor}} 096 {{are very similar}} to the other transmissions engineered and manufactured by STA: AR4, AD4 and AD8, which were deployed on Renault vehicles in the 1980s and 1990s. It is an electronically controlled transmission with a lockup torque converter, using planetary <b>gears,</b> <b>clutch</b> packs, and a gear-driven final drive with an open-differential. There is no chain inside this transmission. It does not have provision for a dipstick. It was determined that a dipstick and fill might invite owners to introduce incorrect or inferior fluid.

50|$|Under some conditions, a {{different}} 5-speed transmission problem arose. Second gear could overheat and break, causing the transmission to lock.

50|$|The vehicle has two two {{cylinder}} flat 120 x 120 mm {{liquid cooled}} Benz engines (the {{same as the}} 1st Präsident passenger car), which are mounted under the frame behind the rear axle.

The second engine could be started or switched off anytime during the drive. Switching off the second engine cuts the fuel consumption in half.Another interesting detail is the both engines vapour cooling - coolant fumes are led to the roof condenser and the water is recycled back into the coolant tanks placed in the vehicle rear what lowers the water consumption.|$|E

50|$|Even {{before the}} {{construction}} of the T-33, it was decided to increase the scale of work dedicated to creating an amphibious tank. In addition to the Leningrad OKMO, the Number 2 plant of the All-Soviet Automotive Union (VATO), which was already producing armored vehicles for the Red Army, was relegated to the development and production of amphibious armored vehicles. As a result, at the 2nd VATO plant, under the supervision of N. N. Kozyrev, the T-41 amphibious tank was produced, weighing 3.5 tons and using the GAZ-AA engine, which was based on the T-27 power plant. The transmission was nearly identical to that of the T-27, and to the power take-off for the propeller, they added a rigid <b>gear</b> <b>clutch.</b> Its construction for turning off the propeller demanded stopping the tank and turning off the engine. The chassis was, in part, borrowed from the T-33, and the caterpillar tracks were entirely from the T-27. Leningrad builders likewise continued the development of a more suitable amphibious tank, and they designated their latest model as the “T-37”. It had the same GAZ AA engine as the T-41, the same transmission, wide use of automotive parts, and the Krupp chassis, which Soviet engineers first encountered {{as a result of a}} technological partnership with Weimar Germany. Although the T-41 was actually produced for the military in small numbers, after testing and battlefield trials the T-37 was denied production due to various minor faults and an incomplete development process.|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{we propose}} a <b>gear</b> <b>clutch</b> {{mechanism}} that essentially changes the linear rack motion into a circular motion. Therefore, we can potentially produce a longer range of HF phase action {{with a relatively}} small mechanism size.

Conditions for jam-free engagements and their mathematical models are devised and experimentally confirmed in this paper. In addition, we also developed a robot joint prototype using the proposed <b>gear</b> <b>clutch.</b> The prototype is actuated by a small single DC motor and is experimentally verified to provide a step change in reduction ratio. The remainder {{of this paper is}} organized as follows: “ Gear–clutch mechanism” describes the concept of the proposed gear–clutch, its model, and validation by experiments. “Robotic joint prtotype” discusses the developed robotic joint prototype using the proposed mechanism and its performance. Finally, “Conclusion” presents the conclusions of our study.|$|E

The gearbox was driven by two electromagnetic motors and had two electromagnetic, multi-disk clutches to control output speed. A dynamic model of the system was created which included a direct current electric motor with proportional-integral-derivative (PID) speed control, a two-speed gearbox with dual electromagnetically actuated clutches, and an eddy current dynamometer. A six degree-of-freedom model of the gearbox accounted for the system torsional dynamics and included <b>gear,</b> <b>clutch,</b> shaft, and load inertias as well as shaft flexibilities and a dry clutch stick-slip friction model. Experimental validation tests were performed on the gearbox in the NASA Glenn gear noise test facility. Gearbox output speed and torque as well as drive motor speed and current were compared to those from the analytical predictions. The experiments correlate very well with the predictions, thus validating the dynamic simulation methodologies...|$|E
