5|$|Tinnitus is not {{a disease}} but a symptom that can result {{from a number of}} {{underlying}} causes. One of the most common causes is noise-induced hearing loss. Other causes include: ear infections, disease of the heart or blood vessels, Ménière's disease, brain tumors, <b>emotional</b> <b>stress,</b> exposure to certain medications, a previous head injury, and earwax. It is more common in those with depression.|$|E
5|$|Bradykinesia (slowness of movement) {{is found}} in every case of PD, and is due to {{disturbances}} in motor planning of movement initiation, and associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation to execution of a movement. Performance of sequential and simultaneous movement is impaired. Bradykinesia is the most handicapping symptom of Parkinson’s disease leading to difficulties with everyday tasks such as dressing, feeding, and bathing. It leads to particular difficulty in carrying out two independent motor activities {{at the same time}} and can be made worse by <b>emotional</b> <b>stress</b> or concurrent illnesses. Paradoxically patients with Parkinson's disease can often ride a bicycle or climb stairs more easily than walk on a level. While most physicians may readily notice bradykinesia, formal assessment requires a patient to do repetitive movements with their fingers and feet.|$|E

40|$|A model {{describing}} {{the process of}} parental adaptation to life after voluntarily placing a child with developmental disabilities in out-of-home care was generated by utilizing grounded theory to analyze 20 qualitative interviews. The resulting model provides an organized understanding of how parents adapt to post-placement stressors. The cognitive appraisals of parents were categorized by their associated emotions: guilt, sadness, fear and worry, anger and frustration, and uncertainty (emotional stresses); and relief (an emotional advantage). Problematic and desirable adaptive responses to placement of both the child with developmental disabilities {{and his or her}} siblings, and the critical or supportive messages from others were determined as contextual factors affecting the <b>emotional</b> <b>stresses</b> of the parents. The primary coping methods employed by the parents to manage the <b>emotional</b> <b>stresses</b> consist of reappraisals regarding the necessity of placement, involvement in the child's life, therapy, and the passage of time...|$|R

African beliefs that sorcery and witchcraft are malevolent forces against which protection is required are accepted; rituals are warm and <b>emotional,</b> <b>stressing</b> personal involvement {{and acceptance of}} spirit possession.

40|$|The {{object of}} {{investigation}} is experimental {{revelation of the}} effect produced by intensive physical loads and <b>emotional</b> <b>stresses</b> on the lipoid metabolism and working capacity. It {{has been found that}} intensive physical loads are likely to bring about an increase in the content of atherogenic lipoproteides in the blood of the human being and animals. High levels of noise exerted on animals and <b>emotional</b> <b>stresses</b> experienced by the human being are likely to cause buildup of the potential of atherogenic lipoproteides. The researchers have designed the formulation of the new carbohydrate-protein-vitamin product which brings to normal the metabolic changes entailed by physical loads and stresses and enhances the working capacity.

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} pubertal and prepubertal male baboon hamadryads and macaques rhesus. The object of {{investigation is}} revelation of the regularities {{of changes in the}} neurohormonal balance during progress of <b>emotional</b> <b>stresses</b> and following disorders in the behavior of apes both in the species and age aspects. The researchers have disclosed the role of changes in the functioning of the neurohormonal systems in the formation of stress-inducing derangements in the behavior of apes and substantiated the predisposition displayed by apes of prepubertal ages to the formation of psychopathological states. The researchers have elaborated a new comprehensive approach to the analysis of the behavior and functioning of the hormonal systems in apes, compiled an ethologic "Atlas" and made up a primate psychophysiological data bank and discovered new ways and methods of improving immunity to <b>emotional</b> <b>stresses.</b> The designed test setup for psychophysiological studies and ethologic methods of investigation have been introduced in the sphere of medical primatology.

25|$|Also {{known as}} 'effort angina', this {{refers to the}} classic type of angina related to {{myocardial}} ischemia. A typical presentation of stable angina is that of chest discomfort and associated symptoms precipitated by some activity (running, walking, etc.) with minimal or non-existent symptoms at rest or after administration of sublingual nitroglycerin. Symptoms typically abate several minutes after activity and recur when activity resumes. In this way, stable angina may {{be thought of as}} being similar to intermittent claudication symptoms. Other recognized precipitants of stable angina include cold weather, heavy meals, and <b>emotional</b> <b>stress.</b>|$|E
25|$|Those {{experiencing}} OBEs sometimes report (among {{other types}} of immediate and spontaneous experience) a preceding and initiating lucid-dream state.

A large percentage of these cases refer to situations where the sleep was not particularly deep (due to illness, noises in other rooms, <b>emotional</b> <b>stress,</b> exhaustion from overworking, frequent re-awakening, etc.). In most of these cases subjects perceive themselves as being awake; about half of them note a feeling of sleep paralysis.|$|E

Survey data (n = 66) were used to gain a general picture of positive reinterpretation use, which was then explored in greater depth using semistructured interviews (n = 13). Positive reinterpretation was positively correlated with self-efficacy and negatively correlated with depression and stress. Interviews identified two types of positive reinterpretation: focusing on the positive aspects of the situation and finding meaning (in caring for a child with CP). Positive reinterpretation appeared to be an adaptive coping strategy used to deal with <b>emotional</b> <b>stresses</b> experienced by parents...|$|R
