5|$|German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has {{proposed}} a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics. He proposes that action {{should be based on}} communication between those involved, in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and <b>falsity</b> can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.|$|E

25|$|The {{truth or}} <b>falsity</b> of his denunciations against Eybeschütz cannot be proved; Gershom Scholem wrote much on this subject, and his student Perlmutter devoted {{a book to}} proving it. According to {{historian}} David Sorkin, Eybeschütz was probably a Sabbatean, and Eybeschütz's son openly declared {{himself to be a}} Sabbatean after his father's death.|$|E

25|$|In {{this context}} Frame defines rationalism as {{any attempt to}} {{establish}} the finite human mind as the ultimate standard of truth and <b>falsity.</b> This establishing of the autonomous intellect occurs {{within the context of}} rejecting God’s revelation of himself in both nature and the Bible. A rationalist, in this sense, states that the human mind is able to fully and exhaustively explain reality.|$|E
25|$|One {{defense is}} {{reporting}} or passing through information {{as a general}} information or warning of dangerous or emergency conditions, and intent to defame must be proven. Also, {{the truth of the}} allegedly defamatory statement will always negate the claim (whether because the plaintiff fails to meet his/her burden of proving <b>falsity</b> or because the defendant proves the statement to be true).|$|E
25|$|According to Simplicius, Diogenes the Cynic {{said nothing}} upon hearing Zeno's arguments, but {{stood up and}} walked, in order to {{demonstrate}} the <b>falsity</b> of Zeno's conclusions. To fully solve any of the paradoxes, however, one needs to show {{what is wrong with}} the argument, not just the conclusions. Through history, several solutions have been proposed, among the earliest recorded being those of Aristotle and Archimedes.|$|E

25|$|Hume's {{argument}} {{is supported by}} modern day compatibilists such as R. E. Hobart, a pseudonym of philosopher Dickinson S. Miller. However, P. F. Strawson argued {{that the issue of}} whether we hold one another morally responsible does not ultimately depend on the truth or <b>falsity</b> of a metaphysical thesis such as determinism. This is because our so holding one another is a non-rational human sentiment that is not predicated on such theses.|$|E
25|$|Another {{criticism}} of constructivism {{is that it}} holds that the concepts of two different social formations be entirely different and incommensurate. This being the case, {{it is impossible to}} make comparative judgements about statements made according to each worldview. This is because the criteria of judgement will themselves have to be based on some worldview or other. If this is the case, then it brings into question how communication between them about the truth or <b>falsity</b> of any given statement could be established.|$|E

25|$|Further {{evidence}} that early Greek thinkers {{were concerned with}} the principles of reasoning is found in the fragment called dissoi logoi, probably written {{at the beginning of the}} fourth century BC. This is part of a protracted debate about truth and <b>falsity.</b> In the case of the classical Greek city-states, interest in argumentation was also stimulated by the activities of the Rhetoricians or Orators and the Sophists, who used arguments to defend or attack a thesis, both in legal and political contexts.|$|E
25|$|The {{religious}} views espoused by respondents might seem incredible, if not preposterous, to most people. But if those doctrines {{are subject to}} trial before a jury charged with finding their truth or <b>falsity,</b> then {{the same can be}} done with the religious beliefs of any sect. When the triers of fact undertake that task, they enter a forbidden domain. The First Amendment does not select any one group or any one type of religion for preferred treatment. It puts them all in that position.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong {{argues that}} states of affairs are {{distinct}} things in ontology {{because they are}} {{more than the sum of}} their parts. If some particular a has a non-symmetric relation R to another particular b, then R (a, b) differs from R (b, a). It may be the case that R (a, b) obtains in the world but R (b, a) does not. Without states of affairs instantiating the particulars and universals (including relations), we cannot account for the truth of the one case and the <b>falsity</b> of the other.|$|E

He recommended that the emperor graciously accept the peace offer to restore the normal trade {{relations between the two}} countries. The Qianlong Emperor however realized the <b>falsity</b> of the report, and ordered Yang back to Beijing. On his arrival, Yang committed suicide at the order of the Emperor.|$|E
25|$|Mathematicians {{seek out}} {{patterns}} {{and use them}} to formulate new conjectures. Mathematicians resolve the truth or <b>falsity</b> of conjectures by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.|$|E
25|$|Irving's {{decision}} to file his lawsuit in the English courts {{gave him the}} upper hand by shifting the burden of proof. Under American libel law, a public figure {{who claims to have}} been libelled must prove that the statements in question are defamatory, that they are false, and that they were made with actual malice or with reckless disregard for their truth or <b>falsity.</b> Furthermore, reliance on reliable sources (even if they prove false) is a valid defence. In contrast, English libel law requires only that the claimant show that the statements are defamatory. The burden of proof falls on the defendant to prove that the statements were substantially true, and reliance on sources is irrelevant.|$|E
60|$|And so {{the history}} of that mine became once more plunged in darkness, lit only by some monster {{pyrotechnical}} displays of gossip. And perhaps the most curious feature of the whole matter is this: {{that we should have}} dwelt in this quiet corner of the mountains, with not a dozen neighbours, and yet struggled all the while, like desperate swimmers, in this sea of <b>falsities</b> and contradictions. Wherever a man is, there will be a lie.|$|R
60|$|Of {{course you}} must feel perplexed. The paper takes up {{different}} sets of <b>falsities,</b> quite different and contradictory, and treats them as facts, and writes 'leaders' on them, {{as if they were}} facts. The reader, at last, falls into a state of confusion, and sees nothing clearly except that somehow or other, for something that he has done or hasn't done, has intended or hasn't intended, Louis Napoleon is a rascal, and we ought to hate him and his.|$|R
5000|$|Much of {{what are}} proclaimed as 'facts' are, debatably, {{exciting}} myths and legends. The books, for example, claim that Shakespeare invented the evil actions he attributed to Richard III and present Caligula as being insane. Some of these <b>falsities</b> {{are listed in the}} song [...] "It's Not True" [...] in the CBBC TV series. Promoting Reading for Pleasure in the Primary School argues that the series provides an extensive level of detail for the subject material, and uses strong, authentic sources.|$|R
25|$|The {{political}} novel, The Writing on the Wall, an anti-war {{novel and}} roman à clef {{based on a}} possible John McCain presidency in 2008, warns against war with Iran by portraying a worst-case scenario of its outcomes. In it, author Hannes Artens portrays a global depression {{as a result of}} the oil price shooting past $140 per barrel and depicts the <b>falsity</b> of thinking that limited aerial strikes on Iran will end the problem. The story shows them eventually leading to a ground invasion and a military draft in the United States. The book ends with the Iran war escalating into a conflagration seizing the entire Middle East and ultimately culminates in a nuclear showdown between Pakistan and India after an Islamist coup in Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, deep {{insights}} were {{made about the}} limitations to mathematics. In 1929 and 1930, it was proved the truth or <b>falsity</b> of all statements formulated about the natural numbers plus one of addition and multiplication, was decidable, i.e. could be determined by some algorithm. In 1931, Kurt Gödel found {{that this was not}} the case for the natural numbers plus both addition and multiplication; this system, known as Peano arithmetic, was in fact incompletable. (Peano arithmetic is adequate for a good deal of number theory, including the notion of prime number.) A consequence of Gödel's two incompleteness theorems is that in any mathematical system that includes Peano arithmetic (including all of analysis and geometry), truth necessarily outruns proof, i.e. there are true statements that cannot be proved within the system. Hence mathematics cannot be reduced to mathematical logic, and David Hilbert's dream of making all of mathematics complete and consistent needed to be reformulated.|$|E
25|$|Many British {{scholars}} {{were slow}} to accept the truth. Some of the routes mentioned by the work had {{seemed to have been}} subsequently borne out and excuses were made for the known errors. Further evidence of the <b>falsity</b> of The Description of Britain came out in the following years, however, until no serious effort could be made in defense of the document. Bertram had on several occasions adopted variant readings and hypotheses unknown before Camden. The final confirmation that the Description was spurious came in the 1860s. Over four articles in 1866 and 1867, B.B.Woodward thoroughly debunked the work and, in 1869, J.E.B. Mayor complimented this by thoroughly comparing the Description with the Historial Mirror written by the real Richard of Cirencester (his only surviving work), which he had been reviewing and editing for the Rolls Series. Blame fell hardest on the reputation of William Stukeley, although it also impugned Gibbon, Roy, and other scholars who had accepted it.|$|E
