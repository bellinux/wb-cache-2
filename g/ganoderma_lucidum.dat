5|$|Certain {{mushrooms}} enjoy usage as therapeutics in folk medicines, such as Traditional Chinese medicine. Notable medicinal mushrooms with a well-documented {{history of}} use include Agaricus subrufescens, <b>Ganoderma</b> <b>lucidum,</b> and Ophiocordyceps sinensis. Research has identified compounds produced by {{these and other}} fungi that have inhibitory biological effects against viruses and cancer cells. Specific metabolites, such as polysaccharide-K, ergotamine, and β-lactam antibiotics, are routinely used in clinical medicine. The shiitake mushroom {{is a source of}} lentinan, a clinical drug approved for use in cancer treatments in several countries, including Japan. In Europe and Japan, polysaccharide-K (brand name Krestin), a chemical derived from Trametes versicolor, is an approved adjuvant for cancer therapy.|$|E

25|$|The Vietnamese {{language}} linh chi is a Chinese loanword used in tiếng Việt. It {{is often}} used with the Vietnamese word for mushroom nấm (nấm Linh Chi) which {{is the equivalent of}} <b>Ganoderma</b> <b>lucidum</b> or reishi mushroom.|$|E
25|$|To avoid its toxic {{adverse effects}} Xanthium sibiricum must be processed. Hepatotoxicity has been {{reported}} with products containing Polygonum multiflorum, glycyrrhizin, Senecio and Symphytum. The herbs indicated as being hepatotoxic included Dictamnus dasycarpus, Astragalus membranaceous, and Paeonia lactiflora. Contrary to popular belief, <b>Ganoderma</b> <b>lucidum</b> mushroom extract, as an adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy, appears to {{have the potential for}} toxicity. A 2013 review suggested that although the antimalarial herb Artemisia annua may not cause hepatotoxicity, haematotoxicity, or hyperlipidemia, it should be used cautiously during pregnancy due to a potential risk of embryotoxicity at a high dose.|$|E
25|$|Substances {{known to}} be {{potentially}} dangerous include aconite, secretions from the Asiatic toad, powdered centipede, the Chinese beetle (Mylabris phalerata, Ban mao), and certain fungi. There are health problems associated with Aristolochia. Toxic effects are also frequent with Aconitum. To avoid its toxic adverse effects Xanthium sibiricum must be processed. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with products containing Polygonum multiflorum, glycyrrhizin, Senecio and Symphytum. The evidence suggests that hepatotoxic herbs also include Dictamnus dasycarpus, Astragalus membranaceous, and Paeonia lactiflora; {{although there is no}} evidence that they cause liver damage. Contrary to popular belief, <b>Ganoderma</b> <b>lucidum</b> mushroom extract, as an adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy, appears to have the potential for toxicity.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ganoderma</b> <b>lucidum</b> {{produces}} {{a group of}} triterpenes, called ganoderic acids, which have a molecular structure similar to steroid hormones. It also contains other compounds often found in fungal materials, including [...] polysaccharides (such as beta-glucan), coumarin, mannitol, and alkaloids. Sterols isolated from the mushroom include, ganoderol, ganoderenic acid, ganoderiol, ganodermanontriol, lucidadiol, and ganodermadiol.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ganoderma</b> <b>lucidum,</b> and {{its close}} {{relative}} Ganoderma tsugae, {{grow in the}} northern Eastern Hemlock forests. [...] These two species of bracket fungus have a worldwide distribution in both tropical and temperate geographical regions, growing as a parasite or saprotroph {{on a wide variety}} of trees. [...] Similar species of Ganoderma have been found growing in the Amazon.|$|E
2500|$|The lingzhi {{mushroom}} or reishi mushroom (...) is {{a species}} complex that encompasses several fungal {{species of the}} genus Ganoderma, most commonly the closely related species <b>Ganoderma</b> <b>lucidum,</b> Ganoderma tsugae, and Ganoderma lingzhi. [...] G. lingzhi enjoys special veneration in East Asia, {{where it has been}} used as a medicinal mushroom in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 2,000 years, making it one of the oldest mushrooms known to have been used medicinally.|$|E
2500|$|English lingzhi or ling chih (sometimes spelled [...] "ling chi" [...] from French EFEO Chinese transcription) is a Chinese loanword. The Oxford English Dictionary gives Chinese [...] "líng divine + zhī fungus" [...] as {{the origin}} of ling chih or lingzhi, and defines, [...] "The fungus <b>Ganoderma</b> <b>lucidum,</b> {{believed}} in China to confer longevity and used {{as a symbol of}} this on Chinese ceramic ware." [...] The OED notes the earliest recorded usage of the Wade–Giles romanization ling chih in 1904, and of the Pinyin lingzhi in 1980. In addition to the transliterated loanword, English names include [...] "glossy ganoderma" [...] and [...] "shiny polyporus".|$|E
2500|$|It {{was once}} thought that <b>Ganoderma</b> <b>lucidum</b> {{generally}} occurs in two growth forms- a large specimen {{with a small}} or nonexistent stalk found in North America and is sessile, {{and the other a}} smaller specimen with a long, narrow stalk found mainly in the tropics. However recent molecular evidence has shown the first stalkless form to be a distinct species called [...] G.sessile, a name given to North American specimens by William Alfonso Murrill in 1902. Environmental conditions play a substantial role in the lingzhi's manifest morphological characteristics. For example, elevated carbon dioxide levels result in stem [...] in lingzhi. Other formations include antlers without a cap; these may be affected by carbon dioxide levels as well. The species were also formerly differentiated by their colors, of which the red reishi was considered to be the most researched. The three main factors that most greatly influence fruitbody development morphology are light, temperature, and humidity. (Water and air quality are impactful but to a lesser degree).|$|E

50|$|Bolitotherus cornutus is a North American {{species of}} darkling beetle {{known as the}} forked fungus beetle. As a {{holometabolic}} insect, its life cycle includes four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. All life stages {{are associated with the}} fruiting bodies of a wood-decaying shelf fungus, commonly Ganoderma applanatum, Ganoderma tsugae, and <b>Ganoderma</b> <b>lucidum.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is {{cultivated}} in China {{to a small}} extent for cork production, though its yield is {{lower than that of}} the related cork oak. It is also occasionally grown as an ornamental tree. For pharmaceutical grade production of <b>Ganoderma</b> <b>lucidum,</b> known in China as ‘the mushroom of immortality,’ the dead wood logs of Q. variabilis are used.|$|E
50|$|Several of the Polyporales, notably <b>Ganoderma</b> <b>lucidum</b> (ling-zhi), Grifola frondosa (maitake), Taiwanofungus camphoratus (niú zhāng zhī), Lignosus rhinocerotis, and Trametes versicolor (yun-zhi), are commercially {{cultivated}} {{and marketed}} {{for use in}} traditional Chinese medicine. The polypores Laetiporus sulphureus, Fomes fomentarius, Fomitopsis pinicola, Piptoporus betulinus, and Laricifomes officinalis {{have been widely used}} in central European folk medicine for the treatment of various diseases.|$|E
50|$|Ganoderma multipileum, {{commonly}} known as lingzhi or chizhi, is a species of polypore mushroom found in tropical Asia. It {{has been used as}} a medicinal mushroom for over 2000 years. Formerly known as <b>Ganoderma</b> <b>lucidum,</b> phylogenetic analyses published in 2009 revealed that G. lucidum is primarily a European species, and that the name has been incorrectly applied to Oriental collections.|$|E
5000|$|Pharmacological {{research}} has now isolated antifungal, antiviral, and antiprotozoan, isolates from fungi. [...] The fungus with probably the longest record of medicinal use, <b>Ganoderma</b> <b>lucidum,</b> {{is known in}} Chinese as líng zhī ("spirit plant"), and in Japanese as mannentake ("10,000-year mushroom"). In ancient Japan, Grifola frondosa was worth its weight in silver, although no significant therapeutic benefits have been demonstrated in humans.|$|E
50|$|The genus {{was named}} by Karsten in 1881. Members {{of the family}} Ganodermataceae were {{traditionally}} considered difficult to classify {{because of the lack}} of reliable morphological characteristics, the overabundance of synonyms, and the widespread misuse of names. Until recently, the genus was divided into two sections - Section Ganoderma with a shiny cap surface (like <b>Ganoderma</b> <b>lucidum)</b> and Elfvingia, with a dull cap surface, like Ganoderma applanatum.|$|E
50|$|These beetles usually inhabit Polyporaceae or {{more rarely}} Corticiaceae bracket fungi. The larvae {{as well as}} the adults burrow inside the fungi, often {{choosing}} old specimens or old tissue. The whole development, from egg to adult, often takes as little as two months; some are parthenogenetic. A few species are pests of commercial fungi, {{as in the case of}} Cis chinensis, which infests dried fruiting-bodies of <b>Ganoderma</b> <b>lucidum.</b>|$|E

50|$|Damage by {{pests and}} {{diseases}} is minor. In Indonesia, growth rate has been impaired by a rust fungus, Uromyces digitatus; in India, root rot {{caused by a}} fungus (<b>Ganoderma</b> <b>lucidum)</b> has been reported. A beetle (Sinoxylon spp.) can girdle young stems and branches, causing them to break. The insect is of concern, because the tree will develop multiple leaders if the main stem is damaged {{and the length of}} the bole will be reduced.|$|E

50|$|However, {{several recent}} {{molecular}} {{studies have shown}} Ganoderma curtisii to be genetically distinct from <b>Ganoderma</b> <b>lucidum.</b> Calling into doubt the synonymy of the two species and supporting previous mycologists opinion that it is its own distinct species. The same studies {{support the idea that}} G.lucidum sensu stricto is actually absent from the North American continent. And that the correct name for the mushroom widely called G.lucidum in North America should instead be G.sessile, a member of the Ganoderma resinaceum complex, with Ganoderma curtisii as a separate distinct species.|$|E
50|$|Several {{member of}} the Polyporales have had their genomes sequenced to help {{understand}} the genetic basis {{for the production of}} enzymes involved in the synthesis of bioactive compounds, or to elucidate the metabolic pathways of wood decay, including <b>Ganoderma</b> <b>lucidum,</b> Lignosus rhinocerotis, Dichomitus squalens, Fomitopsis pinicola, Trametes versicolor, and Wolfiporia cocos. Two sequenced fungi, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, and Postia placenta, serve as model species for researchers investigating the mechanism of white rot and brown rot, respectively. , there have been 46 Polyporales genomes sequenced, representing about 7% of all sequenced fungal genomes.|$|E
