40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{cascading}} <b>failures</b> <b>in</b> a {{class of}} bipartite coupled map lattices are investigated. We found that for a network with given heterogeneity, international attack {{is much easier to}} trigger cascading failures than random attack. Furthermore, not only the mean node degree but also the largest eigenvalues of the network are found to relate to the size of cascading <b>failures</b> <b>in</b> the network. Therefore, this work might shed some light on the control of cascading <b>failures</b> <b>in</b> such structure of the network...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{discusses the}} translation {{evaluation of the}} dialogues in a novel written by Brown (2003), The Da Vinci Code (DVC), by explaining pragmalinguistic failures and sociopragmatic <b>failures</b> found <b>in</b> DVC translation from English to Indonesian. This research is aimed at evaluating the correctness of the translation of the dialogues in DVC by using a pragmatic approach related to pragmalinguistic failures and sociopragmatic failures. This research is specifically aimed at seeking and explaining the forms of pragmalinguistic failures by using four criteria: (1) <b>failures</b> <b>in</b> translating phrases and clauses; (2) <b>failures</b> <b>in</b> translating conversational routines; (3) <b>failures</b> <b>in</b> translating exophoric deixis; and (4) <b>failures</b> <b>in</b> translating endophoric deixis. In addition, this research is also aimed at seeking and explaining the forms of sociopragmatic failures by using three criteria: (1) <b>failures</b> <b>in</b> translating addressee honorifics; (2) <b>failures</b> <b>in</b> translating hedges; and (3) <b>failures</b> <b>in</b> translating formal expressions. This research is based on error analysis method, which is modified into pragmatic failure analyses. The dialogues in the target text (TT) DVC are {{compared with those of}} the source text (ST) DVC in order to seek for the pragmalinguistic failures and sociopragmatic failures. After the comparison stage, forty data are selected as samples and are analyzed by using some pragmatic insights. In the final stage of the analysis, each data is given an alternative translation of the TT as an attempt to minimize the pragmatic failures. The results of this research show that the dialogues in TT have not fulfilled the criteria of accuracy, clarity, and naturalness; hence, they are considered as poorly translated. The data analysis and the conclusion of each data prove that pragmatic insights, such as illocutionary force, indirect speech acts, conversational routines, positive politeness, negative politeness, deixis, and hedges, can be used as tools to evaluate the correctness of a translation...|$|R

5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: not having enough breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less predictable causes of missing decompression stops. Diving suit <b>failure</b> <b>in</b> cold water may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness. Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of stops the diver is willing to carry out.|$|E
