25|$|Since {{the nuclear}} {{stalemate}} became apparent, the Governments of East and West {{have adopted the}} policy which Mr. Dulles calls 'brinkmanship'. This is a policy adapted from a sport which, I am told, is practiced by some youthful degenerates. This sport is called 'Chicken!'. It is played by choosing a long straight road with a white line down the middle and starting two very fast cars towards each other from opposite ends. Each car is expected to keep the wheels {{on one side of}} the white line. As they approach each other, mutual destruction becomes more and more imminent. If one of them swerves from the white line before the other, the other, as he passes, shouts 'Chicken!', and the one who has swerved becomes an object of contempt. As played by irresponsible boys, this game is considered decadent and immoral, though only the lives of the players are risked. But when the game is played by eminent statesmen, who risk not only their own lives but those of many hundreds of millions of human beings, it is thought on both sides that the statesmen on one side are displaying a high degree of wisdom and courage, and only the statesmen on the other side are reprehensible. This, of course, is absurd. Both are to blame for playing such an incredibly dangerous game. The game may be played without misfortune a few times, but sooner or later it will come to be felt that loss of face is more dreadful than nuclear annihilation. The moment will come when neither side can face the derisive cry of 'Chicken!' from the other side. When that moment <b>is</b> <b>come,</b> the statesmen of both sides will plunge the world into destruction.|$|E
500|$|Desson Howe of The Washington Post wrote a mixed review, {{writing that}} the film is [...] "beautifully filmed and flashily edited", but that it [...] "has nothing to offer." [...] Vincent Canby of The New York Times, gave the film a {{negative}} review, writing, [...] "There are times when the director doesn't even seem {{to know where to}} put the camera. Scenes unravel without dramatic point. No amount of breathless editing and fancy graphics can disguise the amateur nature of the enterprise." [...] In The Philadelphia Inquirer, Roger E. Hernandez criticized the film for its portrayal of Cubans. Hernandez wrote, [...] "The main problem here was the accents. The characters were supposed to be Cuban, but, with the exception of salsa star Celia Cruz, none sounded it." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times criticized Glimcher's direction, writing in his review, [...] "...when it comes to directing dramatic sequences, he is on his own and lacking in resources to make what drama there <b>is</b> <b>come</b> to a coherent or meaningful point." ...|$|E
500|$|Anne {{shared with}} James {{the fault of}} extravagance, though it took her several years to exhaust her {{considerable}} dowry. She loved dancing and pageants, activities often frowned upon in Presbyterian Scotland, but for which she found a vibrant outlet in Jacobean London, where she created a [...] "rich and hospitable" [...] cultural climate at the royal court, became an enthusiastic playgoer, and sponsored lavish masques. Sir Walter Cope, asked by Robert Cecil to select a play for the Queen during her brother Ulrik of Holstein's visit, wrote, [...] "Burbage <b>is</b> <b>come</b> and {{says there is no}} new play the Queen has not seen but they have revived an old one called Love's Labour's Lost which for wit and mirth he says will please her exceedingly." [...] Anne's masques, scaling unprecedented heights of dramatic staging and spectacle, were avidly attended by foreign ambassadors and dignitaries and functioned as a potent demonstration of the English crown's European significance. Zorzi Giustinian, the Venetian ambassador, wrote of the Christmas 1604 masque that [...] "in everyone's opinion no other Court could have displayed such pomp and riches".|$|E

In December 1930, Brownlee asked John Lymburn, his attorney-general, {{to prepare}} a list of known Communist leaders so he could arrange for their {{deportation}} where possible. [...] He staunchly opposed the activities of organizations that he viewed as communist, including the Ukrainian Labour Farmer Temple Association and the Farmers' Unity League. [...] In December 1932, labour organizers staged a [...] "Hunger March", at which 1,000 unemployed met in Edmonton's Market Square and marched to the legislature building. [...] Brownlee refused to grant permission for the march and requested and received police assistance in breaking it up. [...] While he pronounced himself willing {{to meet with a}} delegation of the march's leaders, he believed that the atmosphere at the march would be dangerously volatile and refused to address it. [...] One participant said [...] "A lot of us understood that [...] couldn't do too much, but we figured since it's a farmers' government, least he can do <b>is</b> <b>come</b> out and explain.

2500|$|In December {{outbreaks}} of violence were occurring in Ireland, and Fitzwilliam wrote to Grey on 12 December that [...] "one administration after another {{has lost the}} confidence of Ireland, and ours I fear will do so too; we shall do nothing till the hour of necessity <b>is</b> <b>come,</b> and then what we shall do will be done too late for any advantageous effect". When the Cabinet unsuccessfully put forward proposals for Catholic Emancipation, the King demanded that they pledge never again propose Emancipation. They refused and the government fell. After Grey had suggested to Lord Grenville that Fitzwilliam be offered the Garter, Lord Grenville offered it to Fitzwilliam (who accepted) on 1 January 1807 but the King refused.|$|E
