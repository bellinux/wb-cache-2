2500|$|Gardiner ruled Council {{meetings}} strictly. He controlled {{procedural questions}} strictly, challenging dissident members to appeal his decisions, something no-one {{was able to}} do throughout his term. Members were scolded for talking inaudibly. Meetings went through agenda items quickly. Often, he would not pause to ask for dissenting votes. Leslie Frost commended his performance in 1956 by that stating that the success of Metro to date [...] "has been very largely dependent upon your own personality." [...] Nathan Phillips described his style: [...] "When he really wanted something, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> and beat it out of you." [...] Philip Givens, who was on several occasions brought to tears, described Gardiner's temper as [...] "He {{scared the hell out of}} you. If he cut you up, he did it thoroughly. He eviscerated you, he left your entrails all over the floor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Go-Set was {{a weekly}} pop music {{newspaper}} started in February 1966 by Phillip Frazer, Tony Schauble and their Monash University mates. Meldrum started {{writing for the}} paper in July that year after befriending its editor, Frazer. Frazer said [...] "As I recall it, Ian was sweeping the floor... I said to , 'Who's this guy? Where'd he come from?' and Tony said, 'I dunno, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> in and wanted to do something.'" [...] Meldrum's first story was on Burns, [...] "Ronnie Meets the Barrett Brothers". His first printed interview was with Johnny Young, a singer-songwriter from Perth. Soon Meldrum was writing a weekly gossip column and regular feature stories. He continued until the paper folded in August 1974. By social networking and building a list of industry contacts, Meldrum was able to cover many facets of the local scene; his gossip columns informed not only general readers but also other musicians and, according to Frazer, they were the major reason people continued reading Go-Set.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{factor in}} the change of the band's sound was due to Wilson's meeting of Israeli rock singer Aviv Geffen. The two met when Geffen, a fan of Wilson's music, invited Porcupine Tree on a tour in 2000 {{in support of the}} band's {{previous}} album, Lightbulb Sun. Touring together lead to a separate musical collaboration named Blackfield. Geffen, not being a fan of metal music, kept that project in more of a pop rock genre, sounding more like prior Porcupine Tree albums Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun. This gave Wilson an outlet for that side of his music, allowing him to concentrate on more metal sounds with Porcupine Tree without abandoning the prior genre altogether either. Rounding out the changes was the departure of drummer Chris Maitland, with the replacement being Gavin Harrison, who joined in early 2002. Maitland was unable to make a larger commitment with being signed to a major record label, and the band found Harrison's style more fitting to a more metal-sounding album. Wilson summarized the band's changes at the time as: In Absentia was all written before Gavin came on; even the drum parts were kind of programmed. But it’s one of those times sometimes in life when everything comes together. I’d written these songs and I was very much more interested at that time—having worked with Opeth—in the idea of combining a more kind of brutal or metal aspect back again into the fabric of the music. At the same time Gavin came along and Gavin was a very different drummer to our previous drummer, Chris Maitland. He was much more of a powerhouse and he was much more technical. He had more of a contemporary edge to his sound so {{it was just one of}} those really lucky things that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> in and he played those songs and just blew everyone away and everything just kind of came together. And of course it was the first record we made for our new label and we got signed to a big American label for the first time [...] Gavin was the final piece of that equation in a way—he just totally raised the bar in terms of not just the drumming but just the musicianship right throughout the band. Everyone was listening to Gavin and saying, “Fuck, wow. We really need to step up our game.” ...|$|E

At ten this evening I went to the Secretary, {{but he was not}} come home: I sat with his lady till twelve, then came away; and <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> as I was gone, and he sent to my lodgings, but I would not go back; and so I know not how things have passed, but hope all is well; and I will tell you to-morrow day.

6000|$|A {{something}} wild {{was in the}} air; {{it seemed}} to sweep across the downs and combe, into the very house, like a passionate tune that comes drifting to your ears when you're sleepy. But {{who would have thought}} the absence of that girl for a few hours could have wrought such havoc! We were like uneasy spirits; Mrs. Hopgood's apple cheeks seemed positively to wither before one's eyes. I came across a dairymaid and farm hand discussing it stolidly with very downcast faces. Even Hopgood, a hard-bitten fellow with immense shoulders, forgot his imperturbability so far as to harness his horse, and depart on what he assured me was [...] "just a wild-guse chaace." [...] It was long before John Ford gave signs of noticing that anything was wrong, but late in the afternoon I found him sitting with his hands on his knees, staring straight before him. He rose heavily when he saw me, and stalked out. In the evening, as I was starting for the coastguard station to ask for help to search the cliff, Pasiance appeared, walking as if she could hardly drag one leg after the other. Her cheeks were crimson; she was biting her lips to keep tears of sheer fatigue out of her eyes. She passed me in the doorway without a word. The anxiety he had gone through seemed to forbid the old man from speaking. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> forward, took her face in his hands, gave it a great kiss, and walked away. Pasiance dropped {{on the floor in the}} dark passage, and buried her face on her arms. [...] "Leave me alone!" [...] was all she would say. After a bit she dragged herself upstairs. Presently Mrs. Hopgood came to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] the {{stranger}} assented. [...] "Then I didn't {{know what to}} do, for a minute. The porter was a pretty thick-headed darky, but he was lion-hearted; and his idea was to lay hold of a burglar wherever he could find him. There were plenty of burglars in the aisle there, or people that were afraid of burglars, {{and they seemed to}} think the porter had a good idea. They had hold of one another already, and now began to pull {{up and down the aisles}} in a way that reminded me of the old-fashioned mesmeric lecturers, when they told their subjects that they were this or that, and set them to acting the part. I remembered how once when the mesmerist gave out that they were at a horse--race, and his subjects all got astride of their chairs, and galloped up and down the hall like a lot of little boys on laths. I thought of that now, and although it was rather a serious business, for I didn't know what minute they would come to blows, I couldn't help laughing. The sight was weird enough. Every one looked like a somnambulist as he pulled and hauled. The young lady in the stateroom was doing her full share. She was screaming, 'Won't somebody let me out?' and hammering on the door. I guess it was her screaming and hammering that brought the conductor at last, or maybe <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> round in the course of nature to take up the tickets. It was before the time when they took the tickets at the gate, and you used to stick them into a little slot at the side of your berth, and the conductor came along and took them in the night, somewhere between Worcester and Springfield, I should say." ...|$|E

Now, there is a young girl sitting at the first window, with her profile outlined by the light, whom I feel it an honor to speak to. That's her brother, standing there with her--that tall, gaunt {{young man with a}} Roman face; it's such a common type here in the mountains. Their father was a soldier, and he distinguished himself so in one of the last battles that he was promoted. He was badly wounded, but he never took a pension; <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> back to his farm and worked on till he died. Now the son has the farm, and he and his sister live there with their mother. The daughter takes in sewing, and in that way they manage to make both ends meet. The girl is really a first-rate seamstress, and so cheap! I give her a good deal of my work in the summer, and we are quite friends. She's very fond of reading; the mother is an invalid, but she reads aloud while the daughter sews, and you've no idea how many books they get through. When she comes for sewing, I like to talk with her about them; I always have her sit down; it's hard to realize that she isn't a lady. I'm a good deal criticised, I know, and I suppose I do spoil her a little; it puts notions into such people's heads, if you meet them in that way; they're pretty free and independent as it is. But when I'm with Lizzie I forget that there is any difference between us; I can't help loving the child. You must take Mr. Homos to see them, Mr. Twelvemough. They've got the father's sword hung up over the head of the mother's bed; it's very touching. But the poor little place is so bare!" ...|$|E
