500|$|... 225Ac {{is applied}} in {{medicine}} to produce 213 in a reusable generator {{or can be}} used alone as an agent for radiation therapy, in particular targeted alpha therapy (TAT). This isotope has a half-life of 10 days that makes it much more suitable for radiation therapy than 213Bi (half-life 46 minutes). Not only 225Ac itself, but also its daughters, emit alpha particles which kill cancer cells in the body. The major difficulty with application of 225Ac was that intravenous injection of simple actinium complexes resulted in their accumulation in the bones and liver {{for a period of}} tens of years. As a result, after the cancer cells were quickly killed by alpha particles from 225Ac, the radiation from the actinium and its daughters might induce new mutations. To solve this problem, 225Ac was bound to a chelating agent, such as citrate, <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (EDTA) or diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). This reduced actinium accumulation in the bones, but the excretion from the body remained slow. Much better results were obtained with such chelating agents as HEHA(1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaazacyclohexadecane-N,N',N'`,N'``,N'``',N'``'`-hexaacetic acid) or DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) coupled to trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that interferes with the HER2/neu receptor. The latter delivery combination was tested on mice and proved to be effective against leukemia, lymphoma, breast, ovarian, neuroblastoma and prostate cancers.|$|E

50|$|The outer {{membrane}} {{protects the}} bacteria from several antibiotics, dyes, and detergents {{that would normally}} damage either the inner membrane or the cell wall (made of peptidoglycan). The outer membrane provides these bacteria with resistance to lysozyme and penicillin. However, alternative medicinal treatments such as lysozyme with <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (EDTA) and the antibiotic ampicillin {{have been developed to}} combat the protective outer membrane of some pathogenic gram-negative organisms. Other drugs can also be used, significant ones being chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and nalidixic acid. Chloramphenicol is rarely used in the EU due to the association with drug induced pancytopenia.|$|E
50|$|Waterlogged woods {{extracted}} from a marine environment may {{be covered by}} impurities and sediments.

The calcareous shells from the marine environment can be a frequent component of accumulations on the surface of waterlogged wood. The calcareous can be removed mechanically using scalpels of various profiles and sizes. Iron can also be present on the waterlogged wood. The accumulation of iron can be removed by treating the wood with a 5% solution of disodium salt of <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetic</b> <b>acid</b> in water.|$|E
50|$|An aqueous 1 M {{solution}} of <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (EDTA) is used adjusted to pH 10 with saturated sodium hydroxide solution.

50|$|The {{species has}} become notable for {{producing}} a fine quality wild silk in its cocoon. The cocoons are harvested commercially in Namibia, Botswana, Kenya and South Africa, and the species also occurs in Zimbabwe and Mozambique. An Oxford University research team {{found that the}} cocoon surfaces are covered with calcium oxalate, hindering their commercial utilisation. They discovered and patented a method known as demineralizing using a warm solution of EDTA (<b>ethylenediaminetetraacetic</b> <b>acid),</b> softening the cocoons by dissolving the sericin, permitting the silk to be unravelled with no appreciable loss of strength. Cocoons are also sexually dimorphic, with those of females being roughly {{twice the size of}} those of males, thus yielding more silk. Sex ratios in natural populations will clearly play a large role in the harvesting of cocoons.|$|E
50|$|This is {{necessary}} in order to obtain soft sections of the bone using the microtome. Every thin section cut can be processed like any other soft tissue of the body. Calcium ions found in the bones are responsible for its rigid posture, people suffering from diseases like osteomalacia and rickets have an unusually low amounts of calcium ions in their bones thereby rendering their bones flexible and most times unable to carry their body weight. There are two categories of decalcifying agents namely, chelating agents and acids. The acids are further divided into weak (picric, acetic and formic acid) and strong acids (nitric and hydrochloric acid). The acids make up a solution of calcium ions while the chelating agents take up the calcium ions. Most frequently used chelating agent is <b>Ethylenediaminetetraacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (EDTA). Acids have some effects on the stainability of the tissue.|$|E

In December 1966 Life magazine published a story on a plan for a radically modern new hospital, for which the U.S. Congress had authorized a grant of $7 million and the hospital was to raise $8 million. Geshickter and two other doctors had worked out the design with the goal of saving money, using space more efficiently and, most important, saving lives. The existing facility would be used for patients who did not require intensive care, while the modern new facility with 21 operating rooms and 192 beds would be designed specifically for the acutely ill.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{a variety}} of common {{chelating}} agents with differing affinities for different metals, physical characteristics, and biological mechanism of action. For the most common forms of heavy metal intoxication [...] - [...] lead, arsenic, or mercury [...] - [...] a number of chelating agents are available. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has been recommended for the treatment of lead poisoning in children by poison control centers around the world. Other chelating agents, such as 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS) and alpha lipoic acid (ALA), are used in conventional and alternative medicine. Some common chelating agents are <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (EDTA), 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide (TTFD). Calcium-disodium EDTA and DMSA are only approved for the removal of lead by the Food and Drug Administration while DMPS and TTFD are not approved by the FDA. These drugs bind to heavy metals in the body and prevent them from binding to other agents. They are then excreted from the body. The chelating process also removes vital nutrients such as vitamins C and E, therefore these must be supplemented.|$|E
50|$|Soy {{formula is}} a {{substitute}} for human breast milk. It is a commercial product based upon the proteins found in soybeans. Soy infant formula uses processed soybeans as its source of protein and comes in powdered or liquid form. Usually lactose-free, soy infant formula contains a different sugar. Infants who are intolerant of cows’ milk protein may also be intolerant of soy protein. It differs from human breast milk {{in a number of}} ways. Soy protein inhibits the absorption of iron. The soy-based formulas discussed by the World Health Organization reports that soy formula is fortified with iron to compensate for this effect. One naturally occurring plant-based compound found in soy-based infant formula is phytic acid. It is also a strong inhibitor of iron absorption, though it can be removed in processing. It is not known how many manufacturers of soy-based formula incorporate this practice. China and Vietnam have regulated soy-based infant formulas to include NaFeEDTA (sodium-feric <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetic</b> <b>acid)</b> to fortify the formula and enhance the absorption of iron by the infant. When iron compounds are added to soy-based infant formula, the iron compound is encapsulated to prevent it from making the formula dark.|$|E

5000|$|Trace metals readily form {{complexes}} {{with major}} ions in the ocean, including hydroxide, carbonate, and chloride and their chemical speciation changes {{depending on whether}} the environment is oxidized or reduced. [...] Benjamin (2002) defines complexes of metals with more than one type of ligand, other than water, as mixed-ligand-complexes. In some cases, a ligand contains more than one donor atom, forming very strong complexes, also called chelates (the ligand is the chelator). One of the most common chelators is EDTA (<b>ethylenediaminetetraacetic</b> <b>acid),</b> which can replace six molecules of water and form strong bonds with metals that have a plus two charge. [...] With stronger complexation, lower activity of the free metal ion is observed. One consequence of the lower reactivity of complexed metals compared to the same concentration of free metal is that the chelation tends to stabilize metals in the aqueous solution instead of in solids. Concentrations of the trace metals cadmium, copper, molybdenum, manganese, rhenium, uranium and vanadium in sediments record the redox history of the oceans. Within aquatic environments, cadmium(II) can either be in the form CdCl+(aq) in oxic waters or CdS(s) in a reduced environment. Thus higher concentrations of Cd in marine sediments may indicate low redox potential conditions in the past. For copper(II), a prevalent form is CuCl+(aq) within oxic environments and CuS(s) and Cu2S within reduced environments. The reduced seawater environment leads to two possible oxidation states of copper, Cu(I) and Cu(II). Molybdenum is present as the Mo(VI) oxidation state as MoO42−(aq) in oxic environments. Mo(V) and Mo(IV) are present in reduced environments in the forms MoO2+(aq) and MoS2(s). Rhenium is present as the Re(VII) oxidation state as ReO4− within oxic conditions, but is reduced to Re(IV) which may form ReO2 or ReS2. Uranium is in oxidation state VI in UO2(CO3)34−(aq) and is found in the reduced form UO2(s). Vanadium is in several forms in oxidation state V(V); HVO42− and H2VO4−. Its reduced forms can include VO2+, VO(OH)3−, and V(OH)3. These relative dominance of these species depends on pH.|$|E
