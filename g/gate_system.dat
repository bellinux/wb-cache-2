25|$|Installing faregates {{to prevent}} fare evasion was considered, but was {{rejected}} because {{the expense of}} implementing, maintaining, and enforcing them would exceed the losses prevented. In 2005, TransLink estimated it was losing $4 million (5% of revenue attributed to SkyTrain) annually to fare evasion on SkyTrain. The Canada Line opened in 2009 without fare gates, despite stated intentions to include them. The Canada Line and Millennium Line stations were designed to allow for future fare gates. Expo Line stations have been redesigned and retrofitted to accommodate the new fare <b>gate</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

This lasted until July 25, 2016, when the gates were fully closed. No data have been presented to indicate if the system has reduced fare evasion, estimated at between $6 and $7 million per year, which was the promise of the new $194 million system, although preliminary data showed that revenue had increased by 7% after its introduction.|$|E

A well-designed runner and <b>gating</b> <b>system</b> is very important to obtain a good quality die casting. Two types of runner and <b>gating</b> <b>system</b> for magnesium piston are designed and analyzed based on CAE software.

Combined the solidification law, the distribution of the gas hole is effectively predicted and an optimized design is chosen.

40|$|Design of <b>gating</b> <b>system</b> is an {{important}} factor in obtaining defect-free casting. One of the casting defects is a porosity caused by internal shrinkage in solidification process. Prediction of the internal shrinkage porosity in the femoral stem of commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) is investigated based on the <b>gating</b> <b>system</b> design. The objective of this research is to get the best <b>gating</b> <b>system</b> between three <b>gating</b> <b>system</b> designs. Three <b>gating</b> <b>system</b> designs of the femoral stem were simulated in an investment casting method. The internal shrinkage porosity occurs on the largest part and near the ingate of the femoral stem. The <b>gating</b> <b>system</b> design that has ingates cross section area: 78. 5; 157; and 128. 5 mm 2 has the least of the internal shrinkage porosity. This design has the most uniform solidification in the entire of the femoral stem. An experiment is conducted to validate the simulation data. The results of internal shrinkage porosity in the three <b>gating</b> <b>system</b> designs in the simulation were compared with the experiment.

40|$|Aluminium-silicon {{castings}} {{are typically}} produced by gravity casting. Bottom <b>gated</b> <b>systems</b> are usually required if surface turbulence {{is to be}} eliminated. Latest research has demonstrated, that for every liquid metal there is critical velocity above which the surface will fold over and entrain itself in {{the bulk of the}} metal.

40|$|This thesis {{proposed}} an optimization technique for design of <b>gating</b> <b>system</b> parameters {{of a light}} metal casting based on the Taguchi method with multiple performance characteristics. Firstly, the casting model with a <b>gating</b> <b>system</b> was designed and exported as International Graphics Exchange Standard (IGES) models by Unigraphic NX 4. 0. Based on the IGES models of the casting, Finite Element (FE) Models were generated using Hypermesh software. Then, mold filling and solidification processes of the castings were simulated with the MAGMASOFT. Finally, the simulation result {{can be converted to}} numerical data according to the 3 D coordinates of the FE model by MAGMALink module of MAGMASOFT. The various designs of <b>gating</b> <b>systems</b> for the casting model were generated and the simulated results indicated that <b>gating</b> <b>system</b> parameters significantly affect the quality of the castings.
