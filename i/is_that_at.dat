5|$|Every year it is {{becoming}} more and more difficult for football clubs of any standing to meet their friendly engagements and even arrange friendly matches.

5|$|A {{variation}} of this theory by some present-day residents of Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg), <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> least {{parts of the}} room {{were found in the}} Königsberg Castle cellars after World War II by the Red Army. The Amber Room was allegedly still in good condition; this was not admitted at the time so the blame could fall upon the Nazis. To preserve this story, access to the ruins of the castle, which was allowed after World War II, was suddenly restricted to all, including historical and archaeological surveys, but the room is said to be in a storehouse near Konigsburg castle.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing is {{a concept}} from market {{economics}} {{regarding the use of}} pricing mechanisms to charge the users of public goods for the negative externalities generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply. Its economic rationale <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> a price of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing a shortage, and that the shortage should be corrected by charging the equilibrium price rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply {{in the case of a}} tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.|$|E

5|$|Gardens, or yards, around medieval castles, abbeys {{and houses}} were formal {{and in the}} European {{tradition}} of herb garden, kitchen garden and orchard. They were often surrounded by defensive walls and they sometimes adjoined a hunting park. The first Renaissance style gardens in Scotland were built for the Stewart dynasty at their royal palaces. French gardeners were hired by James IV at Stirling in 1501 and James V at Holyrood in 1536, where archaeological remains indicate there were sophisticated formal gardens. Similar landscaping is also found at Falkland and Linlithgow, including the king's knot garden at Stirling. From the late sixteenth century, the landscaping of many estate houses was influenced by Italian Renaissance gardens. These were seen as retreats from the troubles {{of the world and}} were eulogised in country house poetry like that of William Drummond of Hawthornden (1585–1649). Extensive gardens were developed at Pinkie House by Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline (1555–1622), with lawns, fountains, ponds and aviaries for the entertainment of guests. Dunfermline's nephew, George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton (1584–1650), planted a herb garden at Seaton House in 1620. The Earl of Sutherland's castle at Dunrobin was surrounded by orchards, herbs and flowers. The best surviving garden from the early seventeenth century <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> Edzell Castle, where, between 1604 and 1610, David Lindsay (1551?–1610) created an enclosure adorned with sculptures of the seven Cardinal Virtues, the seven Liberal Arts and the seven Planetary Deities, the expense of which eventually bankrupted him.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{attachment}} of accretionary texts {{to the original}} Insular/Anglo-Saxon book relating to the Benedictine Abbey at Cerne in Dorset, there are even questions concerning {{whether or not this}} codex was ever physically housed at this monastery. All one can say for certain based on codiclogical evidence <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> some point after the Dissolution in the 16rth century and by 1697 that these accretionary documents from Cerne Abbas were attached to the original Insular/Anglo-Saxon core.|$|E
25|$|A {{remarkable}} feature <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> {{the south}} shore of Wager Bay a steep mountain range, gorged by former glaciers, strongly influences the weather.

25|$|The {{aim of the}} RLC was {{initially}} to provide regular fixtures for new clubs based outside the 'heartland' of rugby league, although as the playing standards increased, it also accepted teams from the 'heartlands'. The hope <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> least some of these clubs, would eventually progress to become semi-professional clubs that could one day join the 'traditional' clubs in Championship 1; to date, London Skolars have done so with both Hemel Stags and Oxford Rugby League joining in 2013, Coventry Bears in 2014 and Nottingham Outlaws will join Championship 1 in the 2016 season.|$|E
25|$|The {{exponential}} processor transistor growth {{predicted by}} Moore {{does not always}} translate into exponentially greater practical CPU performance. Since around 2005–2007, Dennard scaling appears to have broken down, so even though Moore's law continued for several years after that, it has not yielded dividends in improved performance. The primary reason cited for the breakdown <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> small sizes, current leakage poses greater challenges, and also causes the chip to heat up, which creates a threat of thermal runaway and therefore, further increases energy costs.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} Rome's churches have {{retained}} Early Christian mosaics.

25|$|Even {{though the}} {{microscopic}} physics {{of these two}} systems is completely different, their critical exponents {{turn out to be}} the same. Moreover, one can calculate these exponents using the same statistical field theory. The key observation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> a phase transition or critical point, fluctuations occur at all length scales, and thus one should look for a scale-invariant statistical field theory to describe the phenomena. In a sense, universality is the observation that there are relatively few such scale-invariant theories.|$|E
25|$|Kapton tape {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used tapes and methods for TC and TC {{conductor}} attachment. When several layers are applied, each layer has an additive effect on the insulation and may negatively impact a profile. A disadvantage of this tape is that the PCB has to be very clean and smooth to achieve an airtight cover over the thermocouple weld and conductors. Another disadvantage to Kapton tape <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> temperatures above 200°C the tape becomes elastic and, hence, the TCs have a tendency to lift off the substrate surface. The result is erroneous readings characterized by jagged lines in the profile.|$|E
25|$|Lying {{close to}} the coast of Eastern Macedonia, Thasos was {{inhabited}} from the Palaeolithic period onwards, but the earliest settlement to have been explored in detail <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> Limenaria, where remains from the Middle and Late Neolithic relate closely to those found at the mainland's Drama plain. In contrast, Early Bronze Age remains on the island align it with the Aegean culture of the Cyclades and Sporades, to the south; at Skala Sotiros for example, a small settlement was encircled by a strongly built defensive wall. Even earlier activity is demonstrated {{by the presence of}} large pieces of 'megalithic' anthropomorphic stelai built into these walls, which, so far, have no parallels in the Aegean area.|$|E

25|$|A {{major problem}} in {{determining}} whether the Cimbri were speaking a Celtic or a Germanic language <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> this time the Greeks and Romans tended to refer to all groups {{to the north of}} their sphere of influence as Gauls, Celts, or Germani rather indiscriminately. Caesar seems {{to be one of the}} first authors to distinguish the two groups, and he had a political motive for doing so (it was an argument in favour of the Rhine border). Yet, one cannot always trust Caesar and Tacitus when they ascribe individuals and tribes to one or the other category, although Caesar made clear distinctions between the two cultures. Most ancient sources categorize the Cimbri as a Germanic tribe, but some ancient authors include the Cimbri among the Celts.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to HTTP proxies {{is to use}} {{one of a number of}} add-ons and plug-ins for browsers, thereby avoiding the conversion of the DOIs to URLs, which depend on domain names and may be subject to change, while still allowing the DOI to be treated as a normal hyperlink. For example. the , enables the browser to access Handle System handles or DOIs like hdl:4263537/4000 or doi:10.1000/1 directly in the Firefox browser, using the native Handle System protocol. This plug-in can also replace references to web-to-handle proxy servers with native resolution. A disadvantage of this approach for publishers <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> least at present, most users will be encountering the DOIs in a browser, mail reader, or other software which does not have one of these plug-ins installed.|$|E
25|$|His concert {{career began}} {{at the age of}} nine when his father toured both Isaac and his sister, Clementina, {{throughout}} northern Spain. A popular myth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> the age of twelve Albéniz stowed away in a ship bound for Buenos Aires. He then found himself in Cuba, then to the United States, giving concerts in New York and San Francisco and then travelled to Liverpool, London and Leipzig, Germany. By age 15, he had already given concerts worldwide. This over-dramatized story is not entirely false. Albéniz did travel the world as a performer; however, he was accompanied by his father, who as a customs agent was required to travel frequently. This can be attested by comparing Isaac's concert dates with his father's travel itinerary.|$|E
