5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Arlington Line, which was built several miles to the southwest of Fort Jackson, atop the heights of Arlington, the maintenance of Forts Jackson and Runyon was neglected. The two forts had largely been made redundant by the newer, stronger works atop the hills, and it was believed that neither played a crucial role any longer in the defenses of Washington. Fort Jackson was kept in service only as an <b>inspection</b> <b>station</b> for traffic crossing Long Bridge.|$|E

In 2013, SR7 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 2,450 at the Calexico <b>inspection</b> <b>station,</b> and 15,900 at Menvielle Road along the spur, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.|$|E

Eventually, US 80 did become the most used road into Southern California from the east, but by 1947, the Highway 80 Associated was formed to increase the traffic on the road, since the war and advertising by other cities had caused it to fall again. Four years later, US 80 was reported to be the most used transcontinental highway, and there was a 40 percent increase in the out-of-state cars that traveled through the state <b>inspection</b> <b>station</b> at Yuma during {{the first three months of}} that year. But in 1954, there were reports that traffic had decreased, because the road to Phoenix, Arizona from Lordsburg, New Mexico had improved.|$|E

40|$|Appropriate {{inspection}} is {{a significant}} component of production systems. In this paper a model is developed to determine the optimal placement of <b>inspection</b> <b>stations</b> within n-stage linear production systems. This model accommodates two types of inspector fallibility: "predictable," which implies that the error rates are known and constant, and "erratic," which requires a random variable to describe inspector performance. Cost per good unit accepted by the customer is used as the optimizing criterion. The cost-quality response surface is explored through a sequential sensitivity analysis. Our results indicate that under certain conditions the level of predictable inspector fallibility significantly impacts the number and placement of <b>inspection</b> <b>stations</b> as well as cost per good unit produced. The modeled systems, however, were quite insensitive to the variability of inspector performance. This production-inspection model provides management with information on the optimal number and placement of <b>inspection</b> <b>stations</b> for specific planned or existing serial production systems. It {{can also be used}} by management to explore various policy options, such as the cost implications of increasing the quality vs. the quantity of <b>inspection</b> <b>stations.</b> The data required by the model can be obtained at reasonable cost provided management is willing to estimate or determine judgementally certain of the variables. reliability: inspection, facilities/equipment planning, reliability: quality control...|$|R
25|$|Concourse C {{also has}} a {{dedicated}} Federal <b>Inspection</b> <b>Station</b> located at ground level. International United flights not originating at an airport with US customs preclearance can directly deplane passengers via jetbridge at Concourse C (as opposed to using plane mates to offload passengers). Once deplaned, arriving passengers are separated. Passengers terminating at Dulles take a mobile lounge that transports them to the International Arrivals Building, while connecting passengers continuing on another United flight go through U.S. Customs and Immigration at the FIS station on the ground level. Since this immigration facility is only for connecting passengers on United and other Star Alliance carriers, it has shorter lines and passengers don't have to reclear security at the massive security checkpoints in the main terminal.|$|E
25|$|San Antonio International Airport has two {{terminals}} with {{an overall}} 24 jet bridge gates. The original one-level terminal (formerly Terminal 2) opened in 1953 with ground-loading holding areas and was expanded twice, once in 1959 with new east and west wings, and again in 1968 with an eight-gate satellite concourse, which was built to handle visitors to HemisFair '68. Terminal 2 closed on November 9, 2010 as the new Terminal B opened, and Terminal 2 began to be demolished in March 2011, with completion in January 2012. A second terminal (formerly Terminal 1, now Terminal A) opened in 1984 with a 16-gate concourse. The U.S. Customs Federal <b>Inspection</b> <b>Station</b> (FIS) is located in Terminal A and is accessible from Gates A6-A9. Terminal A will soon begin going through an updating and modernization project.|$|E
25|$|In December 2002, a new International Arrivals Building opened west of Terminal B. This {{structure}} {{houses the}} Federal <b>Inspection</b> <b>Station</b> and has one jetway for deboarding aircraft. Two government agencies support the facility; U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The FIS Terminal can process more than 300 passengers per hour from aircraft {{as large as}} a Boeing 747. This facility cost approximately $7.7 million, which included the building and site work, funded through the Bradley Improvement Fund. Currently the International Arrivals Building is utilized by Delta Air Lines and Frontier Airlines (Apple Vacations) for their seasonal service to Cancun, Mexico and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. All international arrivals except for those from airports with customs preclearance are processed through the IAB. International departures will be handled from the existing terminal complex.|$|E

500|$|The [...] {{portion of}} I-8 {{bypassing}} Holtville began construction in December1969, and was nearing completion in May1971, {{to result in}} a continuous freeway that connected two existing segments from Crestwood in San Diego County to just west of Winterhaven. It was estimated that the bypass would save travelers 20minutes of travel time through the Imperial Valley. The cost of this project was $11.2million (about $ in [...] dollars). However, Holtville residents raised concerns about SR115 providing the only access to {{the eastern part of the}} city, notably the narrow and curved portion leading from the freeway into town. Work on the Holtville portion began at 3:30a.m. daily during the summer in order to avoid the desert heat. In addition to this, construction of the Highline Canal overpass involved a [...] steel span that was prefabricated and made of girders that were hoisted into position by barges. The Matich Construction Company attempted to set the world record for laying the most concrete in a day, aided by the level terrain, but failed to do so after the concrete mixer malfunctioned.

30|$|We {{proposed}} an efficient hybrid approach, based on ideas from an exact method and metaheuristics, for the buffer sizing problem in unreliable homogeneous production lines with several <b>inspection</b> <b>stations.</b> This {{is a difficult}} mixed integer nonlinear program.

This hybrid approach provides a balance between diversification and intensification and works well on homogeneous production lines with up to 40 machines. MHH is significantly faster than ESM and produces solutions that are equally good.|$|R
