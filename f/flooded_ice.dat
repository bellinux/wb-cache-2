40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Sea ice is detectable {{in all of}} the ERTS- 1 MSS bands and can be distinguished from clouds through a number of interpretive keys. Considerable information on ice type can be derived from the ERTS- 1 data. Ice types that appear to be identifiable include: ice floes of various categories, pack ice of various concentrations, ice belts, brash ice, rotten ice, fast ice, leads, fractures, cracks, puddles, thaw holes, and <b>flooded</b> <b>ice.</b> Although larger icebergs can be seen, it is difficult to distinguish them from ice floes. Ice features as small as the small floe of 20 to 100 m across can be detected, and the sizes of features somewhat smaller than 100 m can be measured from enlarged ERTS- 1 prints. The multispectral analysis of the ERTS- 1 MSS- 7 bands provides much information on ice type and ice surface features that cannot be derived from a single spectral band. For example, thaw holes can often be distinguished from puddles because of their different appearances in the two bands. These surface features can be indicative of ice age. Furthermore, snow lines on glaciers can be reliably mapped through the joint use of the MSS- 4 and 7 data...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{carried out}} on commission by New Industries, Iceland, comprised comparative tests {{with a total of}} 10 new retreaded passenger car tyres classified M+S with the same tread pattern with and without special aggregates mixed into the tread rubber compound. The tests were carried out in the VTI tyre testing facility on smooth and roughened water covered ice at a speed of 30 km/h. Water covered ice can be {{regarded as one of the}} most dangerous road conditions. Both braking tests and steering tests were performed. The braking tests measured maximum braking friction corresponding to ideal ABS braking performance and friction with a locked wheel. The steering tests measured maximum lateral friction and friction at a 20 -degree side slip angle (skid angle). The latter value represents conditions in skidding of the whole vehicle or excessive steering angle when entering a curve. The results on water covered smooth ice show that a new non studded winter tyre can get about 30 % improved braking friction and about 40 % improved steering friction by means of mixing the special aggregate composition into the tread rubber compound. Testing this improved tyre on water covered stud roughened ice showed that the friction for normal driving is practically the same as on smooth ice. If the vehicle gets in a 20 degree broadslide, rough ice gave up to 40 per cent improvement compared to smooth ice. Repeated tests however quickly reduced this improvement to 10 per cent. The values obtained on smooth <b>flooded</b> <b>ice</b> with the best tyre aggregate tread compound allows cautious driving while the reference tyre friction is insufficient for keeping a vehicle on the road even for a skilled driver under these very severe conditions...|$|E

50|$|About 19,000 {{years ago}} a large rock slide dammed the Columbia River near Rock Island (just south of Wenatchee).

40|$|During {{winter the}} Yellow River in China is {{frequently}} subjected to <b>ice</b> <b>flood</b> disasters. Possible dike breaking due to <b>ice</b> <b>floods</b> poses {{a serious threat}} to the part of the region located along the river, in particular the Ning–Meng reach (including Ningxia Hui and the Inner Mongolia autonomous regions). Due to its special geographical location and river flow direction, the ice dams and jams lead to dike breaking and overtopping on the embankment, which has resulted in huge casualties and property losses throughout history. Therefore, there is a growing need to develop capability in forecasting and analysing river <b>ice</b> <b>floods.</b> Research into <b>ice</b> <b>floods</b> along the river is taking place at the Yellow River Conservancy Commission (YRCC). A numerical model is one of the essential parts of the current research going on at the YRCC, which can be used to supplement the inadequacies in the field and lab studies which are being carried out to help understand the physical processes of river ice on the Yellow River. Based on the available data about the Ning–Meng reach of the Yellow River, the YRCC river ice dynamic model (YRIDM) has been tested for capabilities to conduct <b>ice</b> <b>flood</b> forecasting. The YRIDM can be applied to simulate water level, discharge, water temperature, and ice cover thickness under unsteady-state conditions. Different scenarios were designed to explore the model uncertainty for two bounds (5 and 95 %) and probability distribution. The YRIDM is an unsteady-state flow model that can show the basic regular pattern of ice floods; hence it can be used as an important tool to support decision making. The recommendation is that data and research should be continued in order to support the model and to measure improvements. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
