The Second <b>District</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal upheld Greer's decision but remanded the issue {{in order to give}} the Schindlers an opportunity to file a new motion. On April 24, 2001 Terri's feeding tube was removed for the first time. The Schindlers filed a civil suit against Michael Schiavo alleging perjury, which was assigned to another court. The judge, Frank Quesada, issued an injunction against the removal of feeding tube until this was settled. The feeding tube was reinserted on April 26, 2001. On appeal by Michael Schiavo, the Second <b>District</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal reversed Judge Quesada's order. In the same time frame, Michael Schiavo {{filed a motion}} to enforce the mandate of the guardianship court (that the feeding tube be removed). The Second <b>District</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal denied the motion. These three decisions, all published in a single order by Florida's Second <b>District</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal, came to be known by the court as Schiavo II in its later rulings.|$|E
