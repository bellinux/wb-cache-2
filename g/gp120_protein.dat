5000|$|Roux was {{a member}} of the {{research}} team (along with his research associate Ping Zhu) that used negative stain electron microscopy and cryo-electron microscopy coupled with tomography to produce the first detailed 3-D images of the surface of the AIDS viruses, revealing spike proteins. They show that the three <b>gp120</b> <b>proteins</b> in each spike consist of a lobed head and a three-legged stalk - and use comparisons with atomic structures to gain insight into the mechanism of fusion. [...] The images produced in his research of HIV structure and genome provide important insights for the development of vaccines that will thwart infection by targeting and crippling the sticky HIV-1 spike proteins.|$|R
50|$|Protein disulfide-isomerase {{has been}} found to be {{involved}} in the breaking of bonds on the HIV <b>gp120</b> <b>protein</b> during HIV infection of CD4 positive cells, and is required for HIV infection of lymphocytes and monocytes. Some studies have shown it to be available for HIV infection on the surface of the cell clustered around the CD4 protein. Yet conflicting studies have shown that it is not available on the cell surface, but instead is found in significant amounts in the blood plasma.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, AIDSVAX {{originally}} {{consisted of}} the B envelope of recombinant gp120, a glycoprotein unique to HIV's surface, from a strain of the virus, MN, known {{at the time to}} infect people in the United States and Europe. The vaccine was designed to provoke the production of antibodies in subjects that would strip the <b>gp120</b> <b>protein</b> off of the HIV viral particles, effectively disabling the virus so that it could not bind to or invade susceptible cells. Then, another group, infected with a second strain of HIV, A244, was discovered in 1995, and a revised, bivalent version of the vaccine was produced that combined elements of both MN and A244. Phase I and Phase II tests of the first version were promising, showing excellent safety in chimpanzees and humans and provoking production of HIV MN and A244 antibodies in 99% of human volunteers.|$|E
5000|$|A {{focus on}} the CCR5 co-receptor as a {{potential}} target for anti-HIV medications began in 1996 {{with the discovery of}} CCR5-Δ32, or CCR5 delta-32, a mutational variant of the CCR5 coding gene. The deletion of 32 base pairs in this gene results in nonfunctional CCR5 receptors. While the frequency of this mutation within Caucasian populations is 0.0808, people of African or Asian descent do not appear to possess this allele. [...] Δ32 homozygotes, or individuals who possess two copies of the Δ32 variant, have no functional CCR5 receptors and are consequently highly resistant to HIV infection. [...] Individuals who inherit one copy of Δ32 variant and one copy of the normal CCR5 gene are CCR5 heterozygotes. [...] Δ32 heterozygotes are still susceptible to HIV-1 infection, but the progression of the disease is significantly delayed compared to those with two normal copies of the CCR5 gene. CCR5 antagonists have been developed which cause deformation in the CCR5 co-receptor, leading to the cell's failure to bind with the HIV <b>gp120</b> <b>protein.</b>|$|E

50|$|ADE of {{infection}} {{has also been}} reported in HIV. Like DENV, non-neutralizing level of antibodies {{have been found to}} enhance the viral infection through interactions of complement system and receptors. The increase in infection has been reported to be over 350 fold which is comparable to ADE in other viruses like DENV. ADE in HIV can be complement mediated or Fc receptor mediated. Complements in presence of HIV-1 positive sera have been found to enhance the infection of MT-2 T-cell line. The Fc-receptor mediated enhancement was reported when HIV infection was enhanced by sera from HIV-1 positive guinea pig enhanced the infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells without the presence of any complements. Complement Component receptors CR2, CR3 and CR4 have been found to mediate this Complement -Mediated enhancement {{of infection}}. The infection of HIV-1 leads to activation of complements fragments of these complements can assist viruses with infection by facilitating viral interactions with host cells that express complement receptors. The deposition of complement on the virus brings the <b>gp120</b> <b>protein</b> close to CD4 molecules {{on the surface of the}} cells, thus leading to facilitated viral entry. Viruses pre-exposed to non-neutralizing complement system have also been found to enhance infections in interdigitating dendritic cells (iDCs). Opsonized viruses have not only shown enhanced entry but also favorable signalling cascades for HIV replication in iDCs. HIV-1 has also showed enhancement of infection in HT-29 cells when the viruses were pre-opsonized with complements C3 and C9 in seminal fluid. This enhanced rate of infection was almost 2 times greater than infection of HT-29 cells with virus alone. Subramanian et al., reported that almost 72% of serum samples out of 39 HIV positive individuals contained complements that were known to enhance the infection. They also suggested that presence of neutralizing antibody (NA) or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-mediating antibodies (ADCC) in the serum contains infection enhancing antibodies(IEAs). The balance between the NAs and IEAs changes as the disease progresses. During advanced stages of disease the proportion of IEAs are generally higher than NAs. Increase in viral protein synthesis and RNA production have been reported to occur during the complement mediated enhancement of infection. Cells that are challenged with non neutralizing levels of complements have been found have accelerated release of reverse transcriptase and the viral progeny. The interaction of anti-HIV antibodies with non-neutralizing complement exposed viruses also aid in binding of the virus and the erythrocytes which can lead to a more efficient delivery of viruses to the immune compromised organs.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, {{like other}} viruses, HIV {{is able to}} {{suppress}} the immune system by secreting proteins that interfere with it. For example, HIV's coat <b>protein,</b> <b>gp120,</b> sheds from viral particles and binds to the CD4 receptors of otherwise healthy T-cells; this interferes with the normal function of these signalling receptors. Another HIV protein, Tat, has been demonstrated to suppress T cell activity.|$|R
50|$|Peptide T is an HIV entry {{inhibitor}} {{discovered in}} 1986 {{by researchers at}} the National Institutes of Health in the United States. Peptide T, and its modified analog Dala1-peptide T-amide (DAPTA), a drug in clinical trials, is a short peptide derived from the HIV envelope <b>protein</b> <b>gp120</b> which blocks binding and infection of viral strains which use the CCR5 receptor to infect cells.|$|R
50|$|Many {{researchers}} believe that HIV damages the vital brain cells, neurons, indirectly. According to one theory, HIV either infects or activates cells that nurture and maintain the brain, known as macrophages and microglia. These cells then produce toxins that can set off a series of reactions that instruct neurons to kill themselves. The infected macrophages and microglia also appear to produce additional factors such as chemokines and cytokines that can affect neurons {{as well as other}} brain cells known as astrocytes. The affected astrocytes, which normally nurture and protect neurons, also may now end up harming neurons. HIV <b>protein</b> <b>gp120</b> inhibits the stem cells in the brain from producing new nerve cells. In the neuronal cells, the HIV <b>gp120</b> induces mitochondrial-death <b>proteins</b> like caspases, which may influence the upregulation of the death receptor Fas leading to apoptosis. Researchers hope that new drugs under investigation will interfere with the detrimental cycle and prevent neuron death.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, BanLec was {{reported}} to be a potent inhibitor of HIV replication.

However, these studies all emphasize that such post-hoc analyses are subject to inherent bias and must be interpreted with caution.|$|R
5|$|Attachment is {{the binding}} {{of the virus}} to {{specific}} molecules {{on the surface of}} the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human T cells, because its surface <b>protein,</b> <b>gp120,</b> can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.|$|R
50|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV-1) {{is the most}} common strain of HIV. It contains three structural genes and six regulatory genes. One of the structural genes is env, which codes for the surface <b>proteins</b> <b>gp120</b> and gp41. Gp41, whose gene is the target for 2F5, is a transmembrane protein that associates with gp120 to bind the virus to CD4 and a chemokine co-receptor on the target cell and infect it. 2F5 binds to the variable regions of env and neutralizes the virus before it infects target cells.|$|R

50|$|The {{failure of}} vaccine {{candidates}} {{to protect against}} HIV infection and progression to AIDS {{has led to a}} renewed focus on the biological mechanisms responsible for HIV latency. A limited period of therapy combining anti-retrovirals with drugs targeting the latent reservoir may one day allow for total eradication of HIV infection. Researchers have discovered an abzyme that can destroy the <b>protein</b> <b>gp120</b> CD4 binding site. This protein is common to all HIV variants as it is the attachment point for B lymphocytes and subsequent compromising of the immune system.|$|R
50|$|The {{env gene}} codes for the gp160 protein which forms a homotrimer, and is cleaved into gp120 and gp41 by the host cell protease, Furin. To form an active fusion <b>protein,</b> <b>gp120</b> and gp41 polypeptides remain non-covalently bound together, but this {{interaction}} {{is often not}} stable, leading to shed, soluble gp120 and membrane-bound, gp41 'stumps'. Separately, cleavage by furin is inefficient, and virions often are released with inactive, uncleaved gp160. Because of the high prevalence of these inactive forms, the immune system often produces antibodies which target inactive Env, rather than active forms of the envelope protein. See Replication cycle of HIV.|$|R
50|$|Maraviroc is {{an entry}} inhibitor. Specifically, maraviroc is a {{negative}} allosteric modulator of the CCR5 receptor, which is found {{on the surface of}} certain human cells. The chemokine receptor CCR5 is an essential co-receptor for most HIV strains and necessary for the entry process of the virus into the host cell. The drug binds to CCR5, thereby blocking the HIV <b>protein</b> <b>gp120</b> from associating with the receptor. HIV is then unable to enter human macrophages and T cells. Because HIV can also use other coreceptors, such as CXCR4, an HIV tropism test such as a trofile assay must be performed to determine if the drug will be effective.|$|R
50|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus exhibits host tropism for CD4 related immune cells (e.g. T helper cells, macrophages or dendritic cells). These cells express a CD4 receptor, to which HIV can bind, through the <b>gp120</b> and gp41 <b>proteins</b> on its surface. HIV also requires a second co-receptor along with the CD4-gp120 complex to enter the target cells - either CCR5 or CXCR4. This demonstrates {{an example of how}} cell surface receptors can affect the tropism of a viral pathogen. Since humans are the only organisms that have cells with these receptors, HIV only displays host tropism for humans. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a virus similar to HIV, is capable of infecting primates.|$|R
2500|$|In 1990, {{researchers}} {{identified the}} first HIV bNAb, far more powerful that any antibody seen before. They described the exact viral component, or epitope that triggered the antibody. Six amino acids {{at the tip}} of HIV's surface <b>protein,</b> <b>gp120,</b> were responsible. The first bNAb turned out to be clinically irrelevant, but in 1994 another team isolated a bNAb that worked on cells taken from patients. This antibody attached to a [...] "conserved" [...] portion of gp120 that outlasts many of its mutations, affecting 17/24 tested strains at low doses. Another bNAb was discovered that acted on protein gp41 across many strains. Antibodies require antigens to trigger them and these were not originally identified.|$|R
5|$|Attachment is a {{specific}} binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human leucocytes. This is because its surface <b>protein,</b> <b>gp120,</b> specifically interacts with the CD4 molecule – a chemokine receptor – which is most commonly found {{on the surface of}} CD4+ T-Cells. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that results in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.|$|R
25|$|The <b>protein</b> <b>gp120</b> is {{necessary}} {{during the initial}} binding of HIV to its target cell. Consequently, anything which binds to gp120 or its targets can physically block gp120 from binding to a cell. Only one such agent, Maraviroc, which binds the co-receptor CCR5 is currently licensed and in clinical use. No agent targeting gp120's main first cellular interaction partner, CD4, is currently licensed since interfering with such a central molecule {{of the immune system}} can cause toxic side effects, such as the anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody OKT4. Targeting gp120 itself has proven extremely difficult due to its high degree of variability and shielding. Fostemsavir (BMS-663068) is a methyl phosphate prodrug of the small molecule inhibitor BMS-626529, which prevents viral entry by binding to the viral envelope gp120 and interfering with virus attachment to the host CD4 receptor.|$|R
50|$|In a June 2008 {{issue of}} the journal Autoimmunity Review, {{researchers}} S Planque, Sudhir Paul, Ph.D, and Yasuhiro Nishiyama, Ph.D of the University Of Texas Medical School at Houston announced that they have engineered an abzyme that degrades the superantigenic region of the gp120 CD4 binding site. This is the one part of the HIV virus outer coating that does not change, because it is the attachment point to T lymphocytes, the key cell in cell-mediated immunity. Once infected by HIV, patients produce antibodies to the more changeable parts of the viral coat. The antibodies are ineffective because of the virus' ability to change their coats rapidly. Because this <b>protein</b> <b>gp120</b> is necessary for HIV to attach, it does not change across different strains and is a point of vulnerability across the entire range of the HIV variant population.|$|R
50|$|Protein {{resurfacing}} {{consists of}} designing a protein's surface while preserving the overall fold, core, and boundary {{regions of the}} protein intact. Protein resurfacing is especially useful to alter the binding of a protein to other proteins. One {{of the most important}} applications of protein resurfacing was the design of the RSC3 probe to select broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies at the NIH Vaccine Research Center. First, residues outside of the binding interface between the <b>gp120</b> HIV envelope <b>protein</b> and the formerly discovered b12-antibody were selected to be designed. Then, the sequence spaced was selected based on evolutionary information, solubility, similarity with the wild-type, and other considerations. Then the RosettaDesign software was used to find optimal sequences in the selected sequence space. RSC3 was later used to discover the broadly neutralizing antibody VRC01 in the serum of a long-term HIV-infected non-progressor individual.|$|R
