25|$|Water: The water {{signs are}} Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. A native with mainly water signs {{will be very}} {{emotional}} and find it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at anything dispassionately. They tend to respond slowly to questions and need time to grasp a new concept. Water subjects can {{find it difficult to}} explain their feelings, and so can be difficult to live with, but they are also kind and sympathetic to those they love. They need to give and receive a lot of affection and will direct it towards family, close friends and animals. A subject lacking water may lack intuition and be unable to see the needs of others. They may be too full of ideas or too fond of the material world to consider their own spiritual needs or those of other people. Planets in the 4th, 8th and 12th houses in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E
2500|$|Buchanan {{explained}} the song's concept and lyrical interpretation during a track by track {{analysis of the}} album on the group's official website, saying: [...] "This song is about reacting to the press when they slag you off, about how they judge you. When we heard the song we loved it. To be honest, any publicity is good publicity whether it's positive or negative, and it's taken us {{a while to get}} that. When the press write something negative and something that's untrue, it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at that in a positive way. We could really relate to the song." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{elected to}} push on and record 1997's Aftertaste as a three-piece. A {{first version of}} the album was {{withdrawn}} at last minute {{in the fall of}} 1996 when promotional activities had already begun. Eventually, release was delayed to March 1997 for a new audio mix, and the guitarist Chris Traynor (formerly of Orange 9mm) was recruited for the supporting tour. Although the song [...] "Exactly What You Wanted" [...] became a moderate radio hit, the album spent only a few weeks on the Billboard 200 and has sold 135,000 copies as of April 2006. The Aftertaste Tour in 1997–98 would prove to be the band's last. Amid long-standing private disputes, the members decided to call it quits. Asked about the breakup, Hamilton replied, [...] "9 years, 1,600 shows, 5 albums, and we found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at each other anymore" ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Just imagine Mayor Emanuel had {{released}} the video in, say, November —without {{being forced to}} by a lawsuit.... But of course, he didn't do the right thing. He buried the video. He allowed officials to mislead the public. He hid the tapes because most likely he [...] assumed it would hurt his reelection campaign. Thus he {{not only did the}} immoral thing, he did the politically stupid thing. Cook County state's attorney Anita Alvarez probably would've quickly responded with an indictment—just like she did earlier this week, when the tape actually was released. I mean, it's really <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at that tape and not call for an indictment. If the mayor had done that, he wouldn't be the villain in this sordid story. He'd be the hero. Or at least the guy who finally, for once in his life, did the right thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the final}} primary election, Clinton became the {{presumptive}} Democratic nominee. On July 12, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton {{but he continued}} {{to work with the}} Democratic National Convention organizers to implement the progressive positions he had been campaigning for. Sanders spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 25, giving Clinton his full support. Some of Sanders's supporters attempted to protest Clinton's nomination and booed when Sanders called for party unity. Sanders responded, [...] "Our job is to do two things: to defeat Donald Trump and to elect Hillary Clinton...It is easy to boo, but it is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> your kids in the face if we are living under a Trump presidency." ...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the initial}} {{adjustment}} overlooked by many new users is the lenses vertical parallax, that must {{not be confused with}} the horizontal parallax (set manually by the left rocker button). Although the lenses should be perfectly aligned, by design, there is a small vertical axis error inherent for each camera body. This error implies that all pictures (and videos as well) taken with a wrong vertical parallax are <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at, because one eye is looking up while the other is <b>looking</b> down. <b>To</b> effectively correct this optical discrepancy, the camera offers a vertical parallax correction in its menu system: MENU/SET/OPT AXIS CONTROL. The best way to use this adjustment is to zoom at maximum, take a picture, then analyse it with a software stereoscopic player(using row or column interlaced view) to obtain the subject at the same vertical level.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, thank you," [...] {{the visitor}} answered, staring across {{at the head}} of the firm as though he were some botanical curiosity. [...] "Extraordinary fellow. 'Iron' Girdlestone, they call you in the City. A good name, too-- ha! ha!--an {{excellent}} name. Iron-grey, you know, and <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at, but soft here, my dear sir, soft here." [...] The little man tapped him with his walking-stick over the cardiac region and laughed boisterously, while his grim companion smiled slightly and bowed to the compliment.|$|E
6000|$|Yes; {{when we came}} to {{look into}} matters, to count the packages, and to find out where we were, the box with the hole in the canvas was not there. Or, at any rate, Mrs. Greene said it was not there. I worked <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> it up, and even went into Sophonisba's bed-room in my search. In Sophonisba's bed-room there was but one canvas-covered box. [...] "That is my own," [...] said she, [...] "and it is all that I have, except this bag." ...|$|E

[...] "He is very miserable, dear," [...] she said, [...] "because you are so unhappy. If you looked brighter, think how that would help him, and it would show that you are worthy of him." [...] So Elspeth went home trying <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> brighter, but made a sad mess of it.|$|E
40|$|Security and interfering {{networks}} are challenges in wireless networks today. A security technique concerning shielding wireless signal using signal reducing or canceling material {{can be used}} to solve some of these issues. This technique however, is regarded as expensive and <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> implement. <b>To</b> <b>look</b> into these claim, several types of shielding solution were tested and compared in regard to efficiency, cost and implementation. Testing of the solution was done using a test box with the solutions applied to the interior. As a result of the study it was found that affordable shielding solutions with decent attenuation and uncomplicated implementation exists. For higher attenuation performance more expensive materials, installed by professionals, are needed...|$|R

2500|$|The Independent {{reviewer}} Jess Denham {{wrote that}} Cave's [...] "experience of bereavement is blisteringly undiluted" [...] and called Skeleton Tree [...] "a beautiful, shatteringly visceral portrait of grief". Writing for Rolling Stone, reviewer Kory Grow referred to Cave as [...] "the dean of literary gothic song-craft, {{a master of}} wordplay, symbolism and irony" [...] and described how on Skeleton Tree Cave was [...] "bearing his soul like never before", adding that the album [...] "resonates with raw, emotional intensity in a stunning way". NME reviewer Barry Nicolson called it a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and [...] "both beautiful and harrowing, <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> listen <b>to</b> but even <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> away from." [...] In a review for AllMusic, Mark Deming was more reserved in his praise, noting that [...] "the music lacks the dramatic, grand-scale arrangements of Cave's albums of the 21st century" [...] and that [...] "the final effect feels more like an author reading over ambient backing tracks than the sort of evocative sounds one might expect" [...] from the band, but nonetheless concluding that although Skeleton Tree is a [...] "tough listen … it's also a powerful and revealing one, and a singular work from a one-of-a-kind artist." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{had been}} hard to leave {{everything}} at the Fort, <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back from the threshold upon well-ordered books and furniture, and harder still to know that rude and careless hands would jostle them into heaps on the morrow, but Jennie was accustomed to all the hardships involved in being sister to a soldier, and, after she had turned {{the key in the}} lock, set her face to the south cheerfully.

You are changed less than any of us, Elspeth.

60|$|Though Jim Williams {{had never}} been {{described}} to me, my first sight of him fitted my own ideas. He was tall and spare; his weather-beaten face seemed set like a dark mask; only his eyes moved, {{and they had a}} quivering alertness and a brilliancy that made them <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> into. He wore a wide sombrero, a blue flannel shirt with a double row of big buttons, overalls, top-boots with very high heels, and long spurs. A heavy revolver swung at his hip, and if I had not already known that Jim Williams had fought Indians and killed bad men, I should still have seen something that awed me in the look of him.|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} a single figure upon the deck that did not seem mad with terror.
