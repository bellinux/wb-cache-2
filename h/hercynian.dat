5|$|Some mycologists {{classify}} C.violaceus as {{two distinct}} species—Cortinarius violaceus and Cortinarius hercynicus, with hercynicus {{relating to the}} <b>Hercynian</b> Forest region of southern Germany. These species are differentiated morphologically by the latter population's rounder spores. Persoon had described C.hercynicus as a separate species in 1794, though Fries regarded it as conspecific with C.violaceus. Moser separated them once again as species in 1967, and Norwegian biologist Tor Erik Brandrud classified C.hercynicus as a subspecies of C.violaceus in 1983. However, Harrower and colleagues, on limited molecular testing, found no genetic or ecological {{difference between the two}} taxa.|$|E

A continuous area dominated by schist exists to the Northeast and vernacular architecture of the rural areas highlight the local geological diversity. Oldest rocks, from the Pre-Ordovician epoch, {{are found in the}} Schist-greywacke Complex between Rates, Laundos, and Estela. Wandering even further Northeast, there is shale of micaceous clay nature, occasionally quartzite, dating to the Devonian period, that may contain fossils.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hercynian,</b> on {{the other}} hand, derives from the <b>Hercynian</b> Forest. Both words were {{descriptive}} terms of strike directions observed by geologists in the field, variscan for southwest to northeast, <b>hercynian</b> for northwest to southeast. The variscan direction reflected the direction of ancient fold belts cropping out throughout Germany and adjacent countries and the meaning shifted from direction to the fold belt proper.|$|E
25|$|The other {{direction}}, <b>Hercynian,</b> for {{the direction}} of the Harz Mountains in Germany, saw a similar shift in meaning. Today <b>Hercynian</b> is often used as a synonym for Variscan, but is somewhat less used than the latter. In the USA it is only used for European orogenies; the contemporaneous and genetically linked mountain-building phases in the Appalachian Mountains have different names.|$|E
25|$|The Variscan or <b>Hercynian</b> orogeny is a {{geologic}} mountain-building event {{caused by}} Late Paleozoic continental collision between Euramerica (Laurussia) and Gondwana {{to form the}} supercontinent of Pangaea.|$|E
25|$|In {{the time}} of Caesar, {{southern}} Germany was Celtic, but coming under pressure from Germanic groups led by the Suebi. As described later by Tacitus, what is today southern Germany between the Danube, the Main river, and the Rhine had been deserted by the departure of two large Celtic nations, the Helvetii in modern Schwaben and the Boii further east near the <b>Hercynian</b> forest. In addition, also near the <b>Hercynian</b> forest Caesar believed that the Celtic Tectosages had once lived. All of these peoples had {{for the most part}} moved by {{the time of}} Tacitus. Nevertheless, Cassius Dio wrote that the Suebi, who dwelt across the Rhine, were called Celts, which could mean that some Celtic groups were absorbed by larger Germanic tribal confederations.|$|E
25|$|Belgium {{has three}} main {{geographical}} regions; {{the coastal plain}} in the northwest and the central plateau both belong to the Anglo-Belgian Basin, and the Ardennes uplands in the southeast to the <b>Hercynian</b> orogenic belt. The Paris Basin reaches a small fourth area at Belgium's southernmost tip, Belgian Lorraine.|$|E
25|$|The Breton {{peninsula}} appeared {{during the}} Cadomian Orogeny, which formed its northern coastline, between Guingamp and Fougères. The southern part emerged during the <b>Hercynian</b> orogeny. At the same time, an intense volcanic activity left large quantities of granite. Between the Cadomian and <b>Hercynian</b> periods, the region was submerged several times and the sea left fossils and sedimentary rocks, mostly schist and sandstone. Because {{of the absence of}} limestone, soils in Brittany are usually acid. The Armorican massif straightened and flattened several times during the formation of the Pyrenees and the Alps. Changes in sea levels and climate led to a strong erosion and to the formation of more sedimentary rocks. Metamorphism is responsible for the distinctive local blue schist and for the rich subsoil of the Groix island, which comprises glaucophane and epidote.|$|E
25|$|Sediments {{from the}} Late Permian to Triassic periods are absent in the Cesar-Ranchería Basin, but {{evidenced}} {{in the surrounding}} orogens. Intense magmatism and metamorphism affected the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes. The compressive phase {{is associated with the}} <b>Hercynian</b> orogeny, leading to the formation of Pangea.|$|E

25|$|The continents Laurentia and Baltica {{collided}} between 450 and 400Ma, {{during the}} Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces {{of the mountain}} belt this collision caused {{can be found in}} Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or <b>Hercynian</b> Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299Ma) and resulted {{in the formation of the}} last supercontinent, Pangaea.|$|E
25|$|The Alpine orogeny was {{the main}} cause of {{extensive}} tectonic activities and it was responsible for the formation of the hydrothermal field within the region. The Chaves graben was formed by the relative motion of the block with different types of sediments being settled. The most recent formations are a sedimentary series (lacustrine, alluvial, colluvial, detritic, etc.) with variable thickness that had their origin during the Miocene. Two main faults cross and influence the tectonic activities: the north-northeast by south-southeast Chaves-Verin Fault and a fault system crossing near Faiões and Santo Estêvão. The first fault developed from late <b>Hercynian</b> tectonic episode occurring between 280 and 300 million years ago, that developed into an almost north-south direction into the lithosphere. Intense neotectonic activity reactivated these old fractures, originating in a complex pattern of faults in the sedimentary basin.|$|E
25|$|The Carboniferous {{was a time}} {{of active}} {{mountain}} building, as the supercontinent Pangea came together. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America-Europe (Laurussia) along the present line of eastern North America. This continental collision resulted in the <b>Hercynian</b> orogeny in Europe, and the Alleghenian orogeny in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted Appalachians southwestward as the Ouachita Mountains. In the same time frame, much of present eastern Eurasian plate welded itself to Europe along the line of the Ural mountains. There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous the Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the Rheic Ocean (closed by the assembly of South and North America), the small, shallow Ural Ocean (which was closed by the collision of Baltica, and Siberia continents, creating the Ural Mountains) and Proto-Tethys Ocean.|$|E
25|$|Metropolitan France has a {{wide variety}} of {{topographical}} sets and natural landscapes. Large parts of the current territory of France were raised during several tectonic episodes like the <b>Hercynian</b> uplift in the Paleozoic Era, during which the Armorican Massif, the Massif Central, the Morvan massif, the Vosges and Ardennes ranges and the island of Corsica were formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the Aquitaine basin in the southwest and the Paris basin in the north,the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of Beauce and Brie. Various routes of natural passage, such as the Rhône valley, allow easy communications. The Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. The highest peak of the Alps is Mont-Blanc at 4809 metres above sea level. Although 60% of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks, these risks remain moderate. The coastlines offer contrasting landscapes: mountain ranges along the French Riviera, coastal cliffs such as the Côte d'Albâtre, and wide sandy plains in the Languedoc. The river system of France comprises the four major rivers Loire, Seine, Garonne and Rhône and their tributaries, whose combined catchment includes over 62% of the metropolitan territory. Other water courses drain towards the Meuse and Rhine along the north-eastern borders. France has 11 million square kilometres of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction, of which 97% are overseas.|$|E

2500|$|The {{region is}} {{dominated}} by the Quaternary Chaves sedimentary basin, a graben aligned on a north-northeast to south-southwest orientation bounded by the <b>Hercynian</b> massif and metamorphic schistose formations. Mixed with the schistose complex, there are bands of graphitic slates, mainly {{in the southern part of}} the urbanized area of Chaves and south-east of Faiões. To the north, and into Galicia, the basin extends into the depression of the Verin Basin. One of the oldest formations in the region, it dates back to the Ordovician period ( [...] between 488.3±1.7 to 443.7±1.5 million years ago), is composed of schist and graywacke deposits.

2500|$|North of the Danube, Dacians {{occupied}} a larger territory than Ptolemaic Dacia, stretching between Bohemia {{in the west}} and the Dnieper cataracts in the east, and up to the Pripyat, Vistula, and Oder rivers in the north and northwest. In BC 53, Julius Caesar stated that the Dacian territory was on the eastern border of the <b>Hercynian</b> forest. According to Strabo's Geographica, written around AD 20, the Getes (Geto-Dacians) bordered the Suevi who lived in the <b>Hercynian</b> Forest, which is somewhere {{in the vicinity of the}} river Duria, the present-day Vah (Waag). Dacians lived on both sides of the Danube. [...] According to Strabo, Moesians also lived on both sides of the Danube. According to Agrippa, Dacia was limited by the Baltic Ocean in the North and by the Vistula in the West. The names of the people and settlements confirm Dacia's borders as described by Agrippa. Dacian people also lived south of the Danube.|$|E
2500|$|Strabo (64/63 BC – c. 24 AD), in Book IV (6.9) of his Geography also {{associates}} the Suebi {{with the}} <b>Hercynian</b> Forest {{and the south}} of Germania north of the Danube. He describes a chain of mountains north of the Danube that is like a lower extension of the Alps, possibly the Swabian Alps, and further east the Gabreta forest, possibly the modern Bohemian forest. In Book VII (1.3) Strabo specifically mentions as Suevic peoples the Marcomanni, who under King Marobodus had moved into the same <b>Hercynian</b> forest as the Coldui (possibly the Quadi), taking over an area called [...] "Boihaemum". This king [...] "took the rulership and acquired, {{in addition to the}} peoples aforementioned, the Lugii (a large tribe), the Zumi, the Butones, the Mugilones, the Sibini, and also the Semnones, a large tribe of the Suevi themselves". Some of these tribes were [...] "inside the forest" [...] and some [...] "outside of it". Tacitus confirms the name [...] "Boiemum", saying it was a survival marking the old traditional population of the place, the Celtic Boii, though the population had changed.|$|E
2500|$|Florus's {{report of}} the peace brought to Germany by Drusus is glowing but premature. He built [...] "more than five hundred forts" [...] and two bridges guarded by fleets. [...] "He opened a way through the <b>Hercynian</b> Forest", which implies but still does not overtly state that he had subdued the Suebi. [...] "In a word, there was such peace in Germany that the {{inhabitants}} seemed changed ... and the very climate milder and softer {{than it used to}} be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arminius, {{leader of}} the Cherusci and allies, now had a free hand. He accused Maroboduus of hiding in the <b>Hercynian</b> Forest while the other Germans fought for freedom, and accused Maroboduus of being the only king among the Germans. The two groups [...] "turned their arms against each other." [...] The Suebic Semnones and Langobardi rebelled against their king {{and went over to}} the Cherusci. Left with only the Marcomanni and Herminius' uncle, who had defected, Maroboduus appealed to Drusus, now {{governor}} of Illyricum, and was given only a pretext of aid.|$|E

According to Ptolemy the [...] "Suevi Semnones" [...] live upon the Elbe and stretch as far east as a river apparently named after them, the Suevus, probably the Oder. South of them he places the Silingi, and then, again upon the Elbe, the Calucones. To the southeast further up the upper Elbe he places not the Hermunduri mentioned by other authors (who had possibly moved westwards and become Ptolemy's [...] "Teuriochaemai", and the later Thuringii), but the Baenochaemae (whose name appears to be somehow related to the modern name Bohemia, and somehow derived from the older placename mentioned by Strabo and Tacitus as the capital of King Marobodus after he settled his Marcomanni in the <b>Hercynian</b> forest). A monument confirms that the Juthungi, who fought the Romans in the 3rd century, and were associated with the Alamanni, were Semnones.|$|E

Therefore the studies of learning in her deepest sciences have been so ancient and so eminent among us, that writers of good antiquity and ablest judgment have been persuaded that even the school of Pythagoras and the Persian wisdom took beginning from the old philosophy of this island. And that wise and civil Roman, Julius Agricola, who governed once here for Caesar, preferred the natural wits of Britain before the laboured studies of the French.

Coniston Water, that oozes {{out from under the}} loam in a hundred places, on the eastern slope, gathers into a rushing stream to cleave the very granite, flows southward around the south end of Coniston Mountain, and having turned the mills at Brampton, idles through meadows westward in its own green valley until it comes to Harwich, where it works again and tumbles into a river. Brampton and Harwich are rivals, but Coniston Water gives of its power impartially to each. From the little farm clearings on the western slope of Coniston Mountain you can sweep the broad valley of a certain broad river where grew (and grow still) the giant pines that gave many a mast to King George's navy as tribute for the land. And beyond that river rises beautiful Farewell Mountain of many colors, now sapphire, now amethyst, its crest rimmed about at evening with saffron flame; and, beyond Farewell, the emerald billows of the western peaks catching the level light. A dozen little brooks are born high among the western spruces on Coniston to score deep, cool valleys in their way through Clovelly township to the broad music of the water and fresh river-valleys full of the music of the water and fresh with the odor of the ferns.|$|E

Both words were {{descriptive}} terms of strike directions observed by geologists in the field, variscan for southwest to northeast, <b>hercynian</b> for northwest to southeast. The variscan direction reflected the direction of ancient fold belts cropping out throughout Germany and adjacent countries and the meaning shifted from direction to the fold belt proper.|$|E

The divisions are simply called the North, Central and South Armorican Zones. Generally the north was less deformed during the <b>Hercynian</b> orogeny than the south. The South Armorican Zone is {{considered part of}} the core of the <b>Hercynian</b> orogeny, comparable to the Moldanubian Zone of southern Germany and central Europe. Late <b>Hercynian</b> granitoid bodies were intruded along the South Armorican Shear Zone. The northern parts of the Armorican Massif have less intrusive rocks, although a small zone in the northwest of Brittany (Léon Zone) forms an exception.|$|E
