5|$|Blaine saw {{presiding}} over the cabinet {{as a chance to}} preside over the Washington social scene, as well, and soon ordered construction of a new, larger home near Dupont Circle. Although his foreign policy experience was minimal, Blaine quickly threw <b>himself</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> new duties. By 1881, Blaine had completely abandoned his protectionist leanings and now used his position as Secretary of State to promote freer trade, especially within the western hemisphere. His reasons were twofold: firstly, Blaine’s old fear of British interference in the Americas was undiminished, and he saw increased trade with Latin America as the best way to keep Britain from dominating the region. Secondly, he believed that by encouraging exports, he could increase American prosperity, and by doing so position the Republican party as the author of that prosperity, ensuring continued electoral success. Garfield agreed with his Secretary of State’s vision and Blaine called for a Pan-American conference in 1882 to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations and to serve as a forum for talks on increasing trade. At the same time, Blaine hoped to negotiate a peace in the War of the Pacific then being fought by Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. Blaine favored a resolution that would not result in Peru yielding any territory, but Chile, which had by 1881 occupied the Peruvian capital, rejected any negotiations that would gain them nothing. Blaine sought to expand American influence in other areas, calling for renegotiation of the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty to allow the United States to construct a canal through Panama without British involvement, as well as attempting to reduce British involvement in the strategically located Kingdom of Hawaii. His plans for the United States' involvement in the world stretched even beyond the Western Hemisphere, as he sought commercial treaties with Korea and Madagascar.|$|E

25|$|Mannock was {{conscious}} his poor educational and lower-class background {{would put him}} at a considerable disadvantage in the well-educated and higher-class surroundings of the RE. Mannock's solution to his problem was to throw <b>himself</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> work. The method was practical but his insular behaviour was construed as odd. Mannock despised his peers who were disinterested in the war and seemed concerned only with the uniforms, quality tailoring and how it would improve their chances with women. Tired of the banal conversations and lethargy of his comrades, Mannock looked to leave the RE but realised a second resignation would damage his chances of becoming a commissioned officer.|$|E

Despite McGrath not getting nearly as much swing, Hoggard departed for an eight-ball duck, cutting a delivery from Shane Warne to Hayden in the slips. Throwing caution to the wind, Pietersen launched <b>himself</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> natural game, taking 21 runs off seven deliveries before finally being out caught by Damien Martyn, a splendid catch just metres off the ropes, as England looked to subside for 130. However, in yet another twist, Simon Jones and Harmison fought back with some streaky accumulation, pairing up for 33 to reduce Australia's lead to 35 runs. England also got a good start fielding, Pietersen having a flat throw at the stumps to run out Langer for 6, but Hayden and Ricky Ponting rebuilt well.|$|E

Despite McGrath not getting nearly as much swing, Hoggard departed for an eight-ball duck, cutting a delivery from Shane Warne to Hayden in the slips.

500|$|Géricault was {{captivated by}} {{accounts}} of the widely publicised 1816 shipwreck, and realised that a depiction of the event might be an opportunity to establish {{his reputation as a}} painter. Having decided to proceed, he undertook extensive research before he began the painting. In early 1818, he met with 2 survivors: Henri Savigny, a surgeon, and Alexandre Corréard, an engineer from the École nationale supérieure d'arts et métiers. Their emotional descriptions of their experiences largely inspired the tone of the final painting. According to the art historian Georges-Antoine Borias, [...] "Géricault established his studio across from Beaujon hospital. And here began a mournful descent. Behind locked doors he threw <b>himself</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> work. Nothing repulsed him. He was dreaded and avoided." ...|$|E

500|$|In January 1884, Beaty {{was working}} as an {{assistant}} engineer at the Cincinnati water works when Henrietta Vinton Davis, a prominent African American actress, came to perform in the city. Together, he and Davis put on a large musical and dramatic festival in Melodeon Hall which proved to be very successful. Included in the show were productions of Ingomar, the Barbarian and Robert Montgomery Bird's The Gladiator, in which Beaty took the role of Spartacus. The culmination of the festival was a performance of selected scenes from Macbeth, with Beaty playing the title role and Davis as Lady Macbeth. Newspapers in both {{the black and white}} communities of Cincinnati praised the performances of the two actors, with the Commercial stating that Beaty [...] "threw <b>himself</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> part with masterly energy and power".|$|E
500|$|Edgardo {{returned}} to the Catechumens on 22 October, and was visited by his parents often over the next month. As with Momolo's first round of visits, two different versions emerged of what happened. According to Edgardo's parents, the boy was obviously intimidated by the clergymen around him and threw <b>himself</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> mother's arms {{when he first saw}} her. Marianna later said: [...] "He had lost weight and had turned pale; his eyes were filled with terror... I told him that he was born a Jew like us and like us he must always remain one, and he replied: Si, mia cara mamma, I will never forget to say the Shema every day.'" [...] One report in the Jewish press described the priests telling Edgardo's parents that God had chosen their son to be [...] "the apostle of Christianity to his family, dedicated to converting his parents and his siblings", and that they could have him back if they also became Christians. The clerics and nuns then knelt and prayed for the conversion of the Mortara household, prompting Edgardo's parents to leave in terror.|$|E
500|$|Graded by {{a medical}} board as only being fit for {{administrative}} duties, Kippenberger still harboured hopes {{of returning to}} the 2nd Division. However, he was named to replace Brigadier James Hargest, {{who had been killed}} in France in August, as commander of the New Zealand Reception Group. This organisation had been formed to arrange accommodation as well as social and medical services for New Zealand military personnel who were expected to be released from prisoner of war camps in Germany when the war ended. These personnel were to be evacuated to England to await repatriation to New Zealand. It was recognised that transition from the harsh life as a captive to normal life may be difficult for some, and the Reception Group provided much needed support for these individuals. [...] He threw <b>himself</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> new role, setting up facilities and accommodation centres around Dover. The first former prisoners of war began arriving in late March 1945, and Kippenberger {{made it a point to}} personally meet with each group of arrivals. By the following October, the overwhelming majority of released personnel had been returned to New Zealand, negating the need for the Reception Group.|$|E

2500|$|... "Robert" [...] in Cnut's text is {{probably}} a clerical error for Rudolph, the last ruler of an independent Kingdom of Burgundy.

On 23 June, three days before the date set for the coronation, the King and Queen returned from Windsor Castle to Buckingham Palace in preparation. Foreign journalists noted that he appeared [...] "worn and pale" [...] and was leaning heavily on his cane. That evening, the King and Queen hosted a formal dinner for seventy British and overseas royal guests.|$|E
2500|$|... "Liberated", as he said, {{from his}} duties at the gallery and from {{management}} concerns at the Raucourt factory, Copeau launched <b>himself</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> work. In 1910, he bought Le Limon, {{a piece of}} property in the Seine-et-Marne département, away from the distractions of Paris. He worked tirelessly on a stage adaptation of Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov along with his friend from school, Jean Croué, finishing it {{by the end of}} 1910. He was now ready to work in the theatre as a practitioner not only as critic. The play was staged in April 1911 under the direction of Jacques Rouché at the Théâtre des Arts, receiving favorable reviews. Charles Dullin, who played the role of Smerdiakov, was particularly singled out for a fine performance. A second staging of the adaptation the following October, with Louis Jouvet in the role of Father Zossima, confirmed the earlier critical claim.|$|E
