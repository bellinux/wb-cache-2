40|$|This paper {{examined}} the thermo-physical properties of Nigerian used engine oil (SAE 10, 40 and 50). Some {{of the properties}} determined include kinematic viscosity, kinematic viscosity index, calorific value, flash point, pour point, and hydrogen content. Samples of the oil {{were taken from the}} sumps of three different engines. Two spark ignition engines and one compression ignition engine after service covering 1000, 1126, 1500, 2000, 2500 and 3000 kilometers respectively were used to extract samples at these respective distances. The results obtained indicate the deterioration of the samples as the oil ages for almost all the samples tested. Kinematics viscosity for SAE 10 however, increases due to formation of oxidation products such as soot. The compression ratio for diesel engine is high likewise operating temperature is high compared with petrol engine, this result {{in the formation of the}} oxidation product in the engine. No pour point change was observed for SAE 50 oil samples. This is because SAE 50 is a high grade, <b>high</b> <b>viscosity</b> <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> containing so many additives. The overall result reflects the contamination of engine oil samples with lower molecular weight contaminants. After determining these parameters a test rig was designed and constructed in which waste engine oil and mixture of waste engine oil and kerosene were tested for incineration or combustion. The results obtained shows that 14. 3 percent of kerosene will be required for mixing with 85. 7 percent of used engine oil in order for the mixture o...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to {{investigate}} the effect of aging process on the wear and frictional characteristics of polyester composites based on oil palm fibres. Prepared samples of treated oil palm fibre reinforced polyester (T-OPRP) composite were immersed in different types of solutions (i. e. water, salt water, diesel, petrol and <b>engine</b> <b>oil)</b> for three years. The samples were then tested on a Pin on disc (POD) machine subjected to a polished stainless steel counterface under dry adhesive wear at different sliding distances (0 - 6. 72 km). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the damage features on the worn surfaces. Results revealed that aging process has pronounced influence on the adhesive wear and frictional behaviour of the T-OPRP composite. Immersing the samples in water and salt water demonstrated poorest wear performance {{as compared to the}} ones immersed in <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> and diesel.

30|$|Dispersing {{nanoparticles}} inside <b>engine</b> <b>oil,</b> due to {{the base}} oil's <b>high</b> <b>viscosity,</b> {{is a very difficult}} work. Upon the experiments which have been done in this research, using planetary ball mill for dispersing copper oxide nanoparticles inside the base fluid is the most suitable method because it supplies high energy preventing their agglomeration and precipitation. With increase in the concentration of nanoadditives, some of the properties of <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> improved, but it must be noticed that an increase in concentration causes a reduction in lubricating properties of <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> due to agglomeration and precipitation of nanoparticles and as a result causes damage to frictional surfaces. So determining the appropriate concentration to achieve better properties is a very important issue. In the present research, properties of CuO/oil nanofluids at three different concentrations were evaluated. Flash point and <b>viscosity</b> of <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> had a direct relation with the concentration of nanoparticles. Thermal conductivity and flash point increased 3 % and 7.5 % in 0.1 wt.% concentration, respectively. The amount of pour point only at 0.2 wt.% concentration had 3.7 % improvement with respect to the base fluid but decreased about 7.4 % in other concentrations. Based on obtained results, it seems that the nanolubricant with 0.2 wt.% concentration is the best sample for CuO/oil because in this sample pour point and flash point are improved and viscosity has not changed much.|$|R

(2017) Scuffing mechanisms of EN-GJS 400 - 15 {{spheroidal graphite cast iron}} against a 52100 bearing steel in a PAO lubricated reciprocating contact. Wear, 1 - 16 Scuffing of the automotive piston ring on liner contact {{is likely to}} increase due to engine downsizing and the use of low <b>viscosity</b> <b>engine</b> <b>oils</b> to achieve greater fuel efficiency. This work investigated the scuffing mechanism of EN-GJS 400 - 15 spheroidal graphite cast iron caused by reciprocating sliding of a 52100 roller bearing element lubricated with PAO base oil. The contact was conditioned at 100 N and 15 Hz over a stroke of 25 mm at 180 oC. Subsequently the load was incremented in 100 N/min steps at 5 minute intervals until severe scuffing occurred, indicated by a rapid rise in the average friction coefficient. High speed friction was used to determine the onset of mild and severe scuffing. Stylus and 3 D optical profilometery revealed that mild scuffing produced a smooth surface with small cracks compared to the severe scuffed surface which contained adhesive wear craters of 40 ?m in depth. Focused ion beam cross-sections of the mild scuffed surface and EDS analysis of the microstructure indicated that cracks were initiated by dross inclusions with a similar morphology to flake graphite. The transition to severe scuffing occurred at 700 N when crack networks facilitated adhesive transfer of cast iron material to the counter-surface. </span...|$|R

Six different commercially distributed <b>engine</b> <b>oils</b> (primarily intended for motorcycle engines) of 10 W– 40 viscosity grade have been evaluated. Four of the oils were of synthetic type, two of semi–synthetic type. All oils have been assumed to be Newtonian fluids, thus flow curves have not been determined. Oils have been cooled to below zero temperatures and under controlled temperature regulation, kinematic viscosity (mm 2  / s) have been measured in the range of − 5 [*]°C and + 115 [*]°C. Anton Paar digital viscometer with concentric cylinders geometry has been used. In accordance with expected behavior, kinematic viscosity of all oils was decreasing with increasing temperature. Viscosity was found to be independent on oil’s density. Temperature dependence has been modeled using se­ve­ral mathematical models – Vogel equation, Arrhenius equation, polynomial, and Gaussian equation.

Waste <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> was pyrolyzed in a microwave-induced pyrolyzer at 400 °C under vacuum and the N 2 was used to purge the pyrolysis zone to minimize O 2. The fresh and waste <b>engine</b> <b>oils</b> were pyrolyzed and determined it by-products yield, and then the original and pyrolyzed waste <b>engine</b> <b>oils</b> were analyzed its chemical composition for their fuel properties following the standard method. The by-products fuel-related properties obtained from the only waste <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> were comparable to those mixing oil with particulate carbon and different media of microwave and conventional electric heating reactors. In term of its feasibility application to energy and chemical industries this finding could be better with lower production cost...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to find changes of a rheological profile of the new <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> if the used <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> will be add. And also find changes of a rheological profile of the used <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> if the new <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> will be add. For these experiments has been created the blends of the new and the used <b>engine</b> <b>oil.</b> The temperature dependence of the density [kg. m− 3] has been measured in the range of − 10 °C and + 60 °C. The instrument Densito 30 PX with the scale for measuring <b>engine</b> <b>oils</b> has been used. The dynamic viscosity [mPa. s] has been measured in the range of − 10 °C and + 100 °C. The Anton Paar digital viscometer with the concentric cylinders geometry has been used. In the accordance with the expected behaviour, the density and the kinematic viscosity of all oils was decreasing with the increasing temperature. To the physical properties has been the mathematical models created. For the temperature dependence of the density has been used the linearly mathematical model and the exponentially mathematical model. For the temperature dependence of the dynamic viscosity has been used the polynomial 6 th degree. The knowledge of density and viscosity behaviour of an <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> as a function of its temperature is of great importance, especially when considering running efficiency and performance of combustion engines. Proposed models can be used for description and prediction of rheological behaviour of <b>engine</b> <b>oils...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Police Interceptor is {{equipped}} with an external oil-to-engine-coolant oil cooler to reduce <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> temperatures, allowing the vehicles to operate at high rpm/high loads {{for an extended period}} of time without the risk of <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> overheating and subsequent engine damage. This <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> cooler can be prone to seeping oil from the O-ring seals after the high mileage operation encountered by Police Interceptors, particularly where damaged by road salt.|$|R
