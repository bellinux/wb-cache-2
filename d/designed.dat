5|$|A pond {{is a body}} of {{standing}} water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens <b>designed</b> for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds <b>designed</b> for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds <b>designed</b> to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.|$|E
5|$|After 1912, when Skopje was annexed by Serbia, {{the city}} was {{drastically}} westernised. Wealthy Serbs built mansions and town houses such as the 1926 Ristiḱ Palace. Architecture of that time {{is very similar to}} the one of Central Europe, but some buildings are more creative, such as the Neo-Moorish Arab House and the Neo-Byzantine train station, both built in 1938. Modernism appeared as early as 1933 with the former Ethnographic Museum (today the City Gallery), <b>designed</b> by Milan Zloković. However, modernist architecture only fully developed in Skopje after the 1963 earthquake. The reconstruction of city centre was partially planned by Japanese Kenzo Tange who <b>designed</b> the new train station. Macedonian architects also took part to the reconstruction: Georgi Konstantinovski <b>designed</b> the City Archives building in 1968 and the Hall of residence Goce Delčev in 1975, while Janko Konstantinov <b>designed</b> the Telecommunication Centre and the main post office (1974–1989). Slavko Brezovski <b>designed</b> the Church of St. Clement of Ohrid. These two buildings are noted for their originality although they are directly inspired by brutalism.|$|E

The tracks were thereby placed elevated with an island platform with the station on the side, as the first station in Norway <b>designed</b> for double-track operation. The new station was <b>designed</b> in Baroque Revival by Adalbert Kielland at NSB Arkitektkontor. One year later the wooden bridge over Lysakerelven was replaced by a stone bridge.|$|E

40|$|Furniture <b>design</b> for the {{increasing}} plus-size population {{emerges as a}} challenge for the U. S. furniture industry.
