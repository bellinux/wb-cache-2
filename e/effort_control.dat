You tell us that they and we may be upon the very brink of destruction--that this sunlit day may be that day of doom which the human race has so long awaited. So far as we know, you found this tremendous judgment upon what? Upon some abnormal lines in a spectrum--upon rumours from Sumatra--upon some curious personal excitement which we have discerned in each other.

50|$|The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture credits Henry Holderman, {{a citizen}} of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma as first envisioning Grand River as a source for {{hydroelectric}} power for the Cherokee Nation. Even prior to Oklahoma statehood in 1907, Holderman began building political support for such a project. A feasibility study by the Army Corps of Engineers attracted favorable attention in the Oklahoma legislature, leading to creation of the Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA), a state agency, in 1935. Construction began in 1938 on the Pensacola Dam on the Grand River (lower Neosho River) as a Works Progress Administration project. The dam was completed in March 1940, creating the lake behind it. Between 1941 and 1946, the U.S. government took control of Pensacola Dam to divert power to the war <b>effort.</b> <b>Control</b> was returned to the GRDA by the Congress and President Truman amid local celebration in August 1946.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} evaluation of a novel <b>effort</b> <b>control</b> system for cycling, which contributes to promote the users’ mobility and physical health. This system provides automatic control of the motor assistance level of an electric bicycle {{in order to ensure}} that the cyclist’s effort remains inside the desired target zone, regardless of changes in other variables which normally affect the effort, such as the slope of the road. The system presented in this paper controls the pedaling resistance perceived by the cyclist through the use of a sensor device placed inside of the bicycle crankset, which provides the required torque signal. The data processing, <b>effort</b> <b>control</b> algorithm and user interface are implemented in a smartphone application, whereas a microcontroller on the bicycle is responsible for the data acquisition, wireless data exchange with the smartphone, and real-time control of the motor assistance level.

40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} indicates {{the necessity of}} investigating different moderators on the relation between sleep duration and behavior problems. Goal: Present study examines the influence of temperament (<b>effort</b> <b>control,</b> negative affectivity, affiliativeness and extraversion) as a moderator on the relation between sleep duration and behavior problems, both internalizing and externalizing. Methods: 486 questionnaires have been completed. Mean age of the children was 10. 49 (SD= 0. 97). Parents completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ: Goodman, 2001), the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire-Revised (EATQ-R: Muris & Meesters, 2009) and filled out a sleep diary. Results: There were no significant correlations between the interactions sleep duration and temperament and behavior problems. Temperament did not act as a moderator on the correlation between sleep duration and behavior problems. Between <b>effort</b> <b>control</b> and extraversion and internalizing behavior problems {{there was a significant}} negative correlation. Between negative affectivity and internalizing behavior problems the relation was positive. Externalizing behavior problems had a significant negative relation with <b>effort</b> <b>control</b> and a positive significant relation with negative affectivity. Conclusion: Aspects of temperament have connections with behavior problems, but not on the relation between sleep duration and behavior problems...|$|E

This system controls the motor assistance level of an electric bicycle {{in order to ensure that}} the cyclist’s power output remains inside the desired limits, regardless of changes in variables such as the speed of the bicycle or the slope of the terrain. The power output is monitored using a sensor device that provides raw torque and cadence data, whereas a smartphone application processes these data, implements the <b>effort</b> <b>control</b> algorithm and provides the user interface.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a control {{strategy}} is formulated that minimizes the costs {{for a single}} chemical cleaning of a dead-end ultra filtration membrane. From the process model, the performance index and the constraints it can be derived that dynamic optimization {{will lead to a}} ‘maximum <b>effort</b> <b>control</b> problem’, in which the controls (cleaning flow and cleaning agent concentration) are either zero or maximum. The change from maximum to zero is called the switching point. This switching point depends on the overall cleaning time and the requested cleaning effectiveness. From the calculated optimal control strategy it follows that cleaning time can be significantly reduced, compared to conventional cleaning. ...|$|E

40|$|Recently {{developed}} effort regulation models {{argue that}} labor markets are segmented because {{of differences in}} the technology of supervision across firms. primary jobs pay above market clearing wages because these jobs are difficult to monitor. Secondary jobs, in contrast, pose no monitoring difficulties and therefore pay a market clearing wage. If, as the literature suggests, increases in employer size make supervision more difficult, we should observe that wages increase with employer size in primary jobs but not in secondary jobs. We test this hypothesis using a switching regression model. We find evidence of an employer size wage effect in both primary and secondary labor markets. However, consistent with the prediction of <b>effort</b> <b>control</b> models, the size effect on wages is considerably larger in primary than secondary jobs. ...|$|E

40|$|Fisheries {{management}} in the NE Atlantic has recently adopted a precautionary approach to setting catch limits. This {{has been accompanied by}} the development of more complex and multi-species modelling tools for predicting stock size and structure. The scientific community are now being asked to provide an 'ecosystem-based approach' to fisheries management. In this paper, we consider the science needs of this shift to a consideration of more complex systems to include both ecological and socio-economic components. At present, this involves use of the precautionary approach and multi-species management regimes, but will need to include multi-annual quota assessment, 'stake-holder' involvement and marine protected areas. How will these approaches sit together and how will science support them? As an example, we will consider what management of the North Sea demersal fishery may involve in 20 years time.

It is of concern that the target effort level has been exceeded in recent years (Figure 1), which suggests that the current restrictions on effort are not adequate.
