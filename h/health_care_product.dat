40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: {{identify}} the compliance of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>product</b> processing in Primary Health Care and assess possible {{differences in the}} compliance among the services characterized as Primary Health Care Service and Family Health Service. Method: quantitative, observational, descriptive and inferential study with the application of structure, process and outcome indicators of the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>product</b> processing at ten services in an interior city of the State of São Paulo - Brazil. Results: for all indicators, the compliance indices were inferior to the ideal levels. No statistically {{significant difference was found}} in the indicators between the two types of services investigated. The <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>product</b> cleaning indicators obtained the lowest compliance index, while the indicator technical-operational resources for the preparation, conditioning, disinfection/sterilization, storage and distribution of health care products obtained the best index. Conclusion: the diagnosis of compliance of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>product</b> processing at the services assessed indicates that the quality of the process is jeopardized, as no results close to ideal levels were obtained at any service. In addition, no statistically significant difference in these indicators was found between the two types of services studied...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was focused on {{isolation}} and purification of an iron binding peptide derived from shrimp processing by-products. The shrimp processing by-products was hydrolyzed by Flavourzyme to produce iron binding peptides hydrolysate. Then the hydrolysate with iron binding ability was isolated and purified by SPSepharose Fast Flow cation exchanger, Sephadex G- 25 gel filtration and reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), respectively. A peptide of molecular mass 699 Da with strong iron binding ability was obtained and identified by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF) to be LPTGPKS after analysis and alignment in database. Results indicated that the production of iron-binding peptides from shrimp processing by-products supported further applications for high-value bioproducts in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>product...</b>|$|E
40|$|Research and {{practice}} development have become growth industries in nursing, but funding opportunities for such initiatives are scarce and increasingly competitive. Yet, nurses still attempt to secure funding {{in a rather}} pedestrian way and frequently bemoan the lack of success that usually ensues. Typically, they start by applying for internal funding from their own hospital – with limited or no success – and then for external funding from a government health agency or research council – invariably resulting in disappointment. They rarely consider or seek other potential sources, such as philanthropists, charities or industry, even though a number of these, including <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>product</b> manufacturers, have funded such initiatives, albeit on a limited scale...|$|E

40|$|New federal parity {{and health}} reform legislation, {{promising}} increased behavioral health care access and {{a focus on}} prevention, has heightened interest in employee assistance programs (EAPs). This study investigated service utilization by persons with a primary substance use disorder (SUD) diagnosis in a managed behavioral healthcare organization's integrated EAP/ managed behavioral <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>product</b> (N= 1, 158). In 2004, 25. 0 % of clients used the EAP first for new treatment episodes. After initial EAP utilization, 44. 4 % received no additional formal services through the plan and 40. 4 % received regular outpatient services. Overall, outpatient care, intensive outpatient/day treatment, and inpatient/residential detoxification were most common. About half of clients had co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses. Mental health service utilization was extensive. Findings suggest that for service users with primary SUD diagnoses in an integrated EAP/MBHC product, the EAP benefit {{plays a key role}} at the front end of treatment and is often only one component of treatment episodes. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of competition between {{health care providers}} in the NHS has been advocated {{as a means of}} promoting efficiency. In this paper we review one model of competition, internal markets, in which health authorities would be able formally to contract to buy and sell clinical services between themselves, {{as well as with the}} private sector. This paper examines the implications of internal markets for the health service and draws attention to the position of clinicians. In particular it notes that their widespread adoption would require much closer management of the consent of the workload of hospital doctors than is presently the case. The costs of adjustment to and maintenance of a market are considered, including the important role of capital markets. It is noted that the process of negotiation and monitoring of contracts would be improved by better costing information and a clear definition of the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>product.</b> The potential contribution to be made by internal markets is assessed against the policy goals of equity and consumer choice as well as efficiency. It is concluded that at present there is insufficient evidence to justify imposing a variant of the internal market model on the whole NHS. However, in searching for a means to improve the performance of the NHS the authors support the case for experimentation coupled with appropriate evaluation of performance. market...|$|E
