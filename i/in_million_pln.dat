40|$|AbstractRisk, as {{a factor}} {{adversely}} affecting the project, is taken into account as early as at {{the first stage of}} the investment process when the tender is won for a contract. The risk level, identified for a particular construction contract, is a serious factor influencing the decision about accepting the contract or not. The key issue is proper identification of contract risk. The risk factors which {{have a significant impact on}} the success of the project, and are most common ones, are then analyzed. The method of verification depends on the company's experience in the construction industry. The task of the article is to present the results of studies focused on separating and determining the frequency of financial risk factors in construction projects and their impact on project implementation. We have analyzed 30 construction projects (office buildings, production halls, educational buildings, demolition works, etc.) completed in north-western Poland. The degree of risk (planned and real) for the contract was set as a percentage in relation to the size of contract (costs <b>in</b> <b>million</b> <b>PLN).</b> The aim of the study was to verify the existence of relationship between the kind of structure, the size of contract, and the scope and degree of risk. Statistical approach has been used. This study is a prelude to determining the contract risks identification procedure (i. e., estimating reserves to be used in unforeseen circumstances) so that the company could be competitive, and the price offer to be provided to investors could be advantageous...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is {{assessment}} of services stimulated by sewage management on the regional and local level, which should support decisio-making processes. The objective of the study is to develop a theoretcal model of the structure of such services and verify whether the model could be employed to quantify services based on the example of the rural areas of Wielkopolska (Greater Poland Voivodeship). The developed theoretcal model shows the structure of concepts relevant to the performed study process, with focus on the economic dimension of sewage management improvement. The economic results comprise benefits and avoided costs related to the stimulation of ecosystem services as well as benefits arising from a better real estate infrastructure. Assessment of the value of services stimulated by sewage management for the region of Wielkopolska gives a general view of their economic significance. The highest amounts were obtained for infrastructure services (33, 9 <b>million</b> <b>PLN</b> a year). Among ecosystem services, the most significant are those which determine recreational benefits (17, 8 <b>million</b> <b>PLN</b> a year) and drinking water availability (13, 9 <b>million</b> <b>PLN</b> a year).
