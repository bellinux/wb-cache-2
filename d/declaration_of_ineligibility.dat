5000|$|By {{the time}} he retired in 1958, Fisher had {{compiled}} a 636-295-8 record (.600 or better in 32 of 38 seasons) with only two losing seasons, and he held the record as the University of Michigan's winningest coach for 70 years (1930-2000). For five years during the 1960s Fisher coached pitchers for the farm teams of the Milwaukee Braves and the Detroit Tigers, and into his 80's Ray was still working with pitchers {{at the request of}} subsequent University of Michigan baseball coaches. After a reinvestigation into the circumstances surrounding his leaving the Cincinnati Reds, in 1980 Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn declared Fisher a [...] "retired player in good standing" [...] with professional baseball, nearly 60 years after Landis's <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>ineligibility.</b> In an interesting twist of fate, following the 1981 Major League Baseball strike the Cincinnati Reds came to the University of Michigan for workouts at Ray Fisher Stadium where they met the 93-year-old former Reds pitcher.|$|E

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: to {{establish}} the reasons <b>of</b> <b>ineligibility</b> for thrombolytic therapy (TL) {{in a group of}} patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). DESIGN: retrospective analysis of protocols and clinical records. SETTING: the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: we studied the records from patients with AMI admitted to the ICU during a five-year period (1987 - 91) and excluded from TL, to determine the cause(s) <b>of</b> <b>ineligibility.</b> RESULTS: we found 1669 patients with AMI, 89 of which were excluded from the study. Of the remaining 1580 patients, 1274 (80. 6 %) did not receive TL. Mean age was 64. 4 years; 66. 4 % were men. Mortality was 24. 6 %. Mean duration of chest pain was 19. 4 hours. Chief reasons for exclusion from TL were advanced age (43. 1 % of patients) and delayed presentation (55. 7 %); one of these was present in 79. 2 %. CONCLUSIONS: this study confirmed the high mortality of patients with AMI who do not receive TL. Advanced age and delayed presentation were the main causes <b>of</b> <b>ineligibility.</b> As age is being abandoned as an exclusion criterion, efforts for expansion of TL should center on the earlier arrival of patients to centers where it is available...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHealthy volunteers must {{undergo a}} medical {{examination}} before enrollment {{in a clinical}} trial. An increasing number of trials include specific populations designed to match the target populations of the drugs tested. Our study aimed at evaluating which investigations are the most appropriate in different sub-populations of healthy volunteers. Data from 350 healthy volunteers who attended our Research Center from 1997 to 2004 were retrospectively analysed. Volunteers were distributed into five sub-populations: young men, senior men, overweight men, young women, postmenopausal women. The screening procedure comprised a review of medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram and laboratory tests. Ineligibility criteria were classified as non-medical causes, protocol specific medical causes and non-specific medical causes. A total of 148 subjects (42 %) were not-eligible, mainly because of non-specific medical causes (111 subjects), including abnormal medical history (34. 5 % <b>of</b> all <b>ineligibilities).</b> Blood pressure abnormalities were frequent in all sub-populations except young women. Electrocardiographic abnormalities led to <b>ineligibility</b> <b>of</b> only five overweight men and one menopausal woman. Abnormal laboratory tests accounted for 19. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>ineligibilities.</b> In senior subjects and overweight men, serologies, liver function tests and lipid profile contributed importantly to the selection process. Low red cells count was the most frequent laboratory abnormality in young women. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, phosphocalcic metabolism and standard clotting tests led to frequent insignificant and non-contributive abnormalities. Our study confirms that a complete review of medical history is essential and determines the major part <b>of</b> <b>ineligibilities.</b> Complementary laboratory tests are always needed and may be adjusted to the population considered...|$|R
