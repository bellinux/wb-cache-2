5|$|Sandy, Patrick, and Squidward {{arrive at}} a gas station and from reading a {{newspaper}} article, discover SpongeBob's appointment as mayor of New Kelp City. But when they go to New Kelp City to retrieve him, SpongeBob cannot remember who they are. Squidward hi-jinks SpongeBob's limousine and gets away from the city with SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy in tow and they return to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob still does not recall the eatery and wants to return to New Kelp City to resume his job as mayor. Delighted that SpongeBob is leaving again, Squidward requests for his jewel encrusted egg but slips and accidentally throws the egg onto SpongeBob's head, which causes his memory to come back. Patrick, Sandy and Mr. Krabs apologize to SpongeBob for selfishly running him out of Bikini Bottom and are happy to have him back. But even so, SpongeBob still wants to return to New Kelp City. He changes his mind after a breaking news report comes on, saying that the bubbles in New Kelp City are blinding the citizens, and a thug threatens to do something to SpongeBob if he <b>ever</b> <b>comes</b> back. SpongeBob starts cooking Krabby Patties again, much to his friends' delight. With a sigh of happiness, SpongeBob says that it looks like he will be back in Bikini Bottom. Upon hearing this, Squidward takes out his brain and drops it in a trash can.|$|E

But something goes wrong and nothing <b>ever</b> <b>comes</b> out of these gateways {{the same way that}} they went in. Now they come out bent and destroyed.|$|E
25|$|From 1789 {{until the}} 1930s, Congress convened in December, stayed in session {{for five or}} six months, and then adjourned sine die. Occasionally, the demands of war kept Congress in session longer, but {{generally}} senators agreed with Vice President John Nance Garner who famously proclaimed, “No good legislation <b>ever</b> <b>comes</b> out of Washington after June.” By the 1950s, however, the schedule had changed. In 1956 Congress adjourned on July 27—marking the last time the Senate adjourned before the first of August.|$|E

500|$|Maureen and her {{immediate}} family made regular visits to see Hindley, who reportedly adored her niece. In 1980, Maureen suffered a brain haemorrhage; Hindley was granted permission {{to visit her}} sister in hospital, but she arrived an hour after Maureen's death. Sheila and Patrick Kilbride, who were by then divorced, were present at Maureen's funeral, believing that Hindley might make an appearance. Patrick Kilbride mistook Bill Scott's daughter from a previous relationship, Ann Wallace, for Hindley and tried to attack her before being knocked to the ground by another mourner; the police were called to restore order. Shortly before her death {{at the age of}} 70, Sheila Kilbride said: [...] "If she [...] <b>ever</b> <b>comes</b> out of jail I'll kill her". It was a threat repeated by her son Danny, and Ann West.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{has also}} been {{described}} as simultaneously embracing and parodying animated Christmas specials like A Charlie Brown Christmas, Frosty the Snowman and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. It {{has also been}} described as a commentary on the way Jewish children are overlooked during the Christmas holiday; this theme is overtly stated by Stan, who says {{at the end of the}} episode that Jews and Hanukkah [...] "can be cool" [...] as well as Christmas. M. Keith Booker, author of Drawn to Television: Prime-Time Animation from The Flintstones to Family Guy, said although the episode is irreverent in its treatment of Christmas, [...] "even if spearheaded by a singing turd, [...] is about as close as South Park <b>ever</b> <b>comes</b> to being sentimental and nostalgic". Literary critic Mark Caldwell said the fact that Kenny survived the episode demonstrates the episode's [...] "strong, albeit dutifully ironic, undercurrent of conventional holiday decency." ...|$|E
500|$|Cate Blanchett plays Soviet agent Irina Spalko. Screenwriter David Koepp {{created the}} character. Frank Marshall said Spalko {{continued}} {{the tradition of}} Indiana having a love-hate relationship [...] "with every woman he <b>ever</b> <b>comes</b> in contact with." [...] Blanchett had wanted to play a villain for a [...] "couple of years", and enjoyed {{being part of the}} Indiana Jones legacy. Spielberg praised Blanchett as a [...] "master of disguise", and considers her his favorite Indiana Jones villain for inventing much of Spalko's character. Spalko's bob cut was her idea, with the character's stern looks and behaviour recalling Rosa Klebb in From Russia with Love. Blanchett learned to fence for the character; but during filming, Spielberg decided to give Spalko [...] "karate chop" [...] skills. LaBeouf recalled Blanchett was elusive on set, and Ford was surprised when he met her on set out of costume. He noted, [...] "There's no aspect of her behavior that was not consistent with this bizarre person she's playing." ...|$|E

500|$|In the meantime, Henry asks Emma {{about his}} father. Emma tells Henry that {{his dad was}} a trainee fireman who used to {{frequent}} the diner where she worked. The two of them [...] "hung out" [...] a few times, resulting in Emma being pregnant with Henry {{before she went to}} jail. Once there, she tried to tell him about Henry, only to discover that he had died while saving a family from a burning building. However, she later admits to Mary the story she gave Henry was a lie and he should never know the truth about his father. After Emma's reunion of the children with Michael that evening, Henry arrived with pumpkin pie to give Emma in order to thank her for explaining about his birth father. They are interrupted by a stranger (Eion Bailey) on a motorcycle with a unique box. Without giving his name, he asks Emma about finding a place to stay. After referring him to Granny's Bed & Breakfast, she reminds Henry that he said no one else <b>ever</b> <b>comes</b> to or leaves Storybrooke and Henry replies that they don't.|$|E
500|$|At {{two minutes}} and twenty seconds long, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] {{was written in the}} key of C major at a tempo of 100 beats per minute. Performed [...] "freely" [...] in the style of a mellow, 1950s girl group song, the ballad {{features}} Egan's [...] "sultry" [...] vocals. Adhering to [...] "the R motif" [...] Menken employs throughout the entire soundtrack, the pop song incorporates doo-wop. Featuring [...] "cooing shooby-doos and sha-la-las" [...] by the Muses, who perform [...] "gospel-tinged" [...] back up vocals and riffs on the track, Jeffrey Gantz of the Boston Phoenix compared Egan's [...] "soaring" [...] vocals girl group The Ronettes. Describing [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] as [...] "a traditional Disney [...] lament," [...] Vulture.com's Lindsey Weber acknowledged its [...] "unique Motown edge", comparing the Muses to The Supremes. Musically, Irving Tan of Sputnikmusic described the teen pop-influenced [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] as [...] "the closest the Herculean villa <b>ever</b> <b>comes</b> to approximating a Broadway show". Combined, Egan and the Muses' vocals span two octaves, from G3 to C5. Egan's vocal performance is more restrained than those of the actresses who voice Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989) and Belle from Beauty and the Beast (1991). Chelsea Fagan of Thought Catalog described Egan's voice as [...] "sarcastic" [...] and [...] "smoky", while Billboards Taylor Weatherby called it [...] "soulfully belt".Lyrically, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love) is a love song about denial, specifically one's reluctance to fall in love or admit to romantic clichés. Meg voices how cliché and insufficient love can feel. Parodying [...] "classic" [...] love songs, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] differs in style from love songs usually associated with Disney films by offering [...] "a unique spin". Rob Burch of The Hollywood News dubbed [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] an [...] "anti-love song". Described as an [...] "emotional barnstormer", the song begins with Egan singing the lyrics [...] "If there's a prize for rotten judgment I guess I've already won that", which is soon followed by [...] "Been there, done that". Thought Catalogs Chelsea Fagan believes that the first verse [...] "sums up in four lines everything that we’ve ever tried to convey while on our third drink out at the bar with the girls", joking, [...] "I believe this song would come shortly after dancing in a circle with all women, but just before the tearful texting of your ex".|$|E
2500|$|While {{working at}} the Duke library—before and after marrying Modarressi—Tyler did {{continue}} to write short stories and started work on her first novel, If Morning <b>Ever</b> <b>Comes.</b> [...] During this period her short stories appeared in The New Yorker, The Saturday Evening Post, and Harpers. [...] After the couple moved to Montreal—Modarressi’s U. S. visa had expired and they moved there so he could finish his residency—Tyler continued writing while looking for work. [...] Her first novel was published in 1964 and The Tin Can Tree was published the next year. [...] Years later she disowned both of these novels, {{as well as many}} of the short stories she wrote during this period. [...] She has even written that she “would like to burn them.” [...] She feels that most of this early work suffers from the lack of thorough character development and her failure to rework material repeatedly.|$|E

2500|$|George Eastman (Montgomery Clift), {{the poor}} nephew of rich {{industrialist}} Charles Eastman (Herbert Heyes), arrives in town following a chance encounter with his uncle {{while working as}} a bellhop in a Chicago hotel. The elder Eastman invites George to visit him if and when he <b>ever</b> <b>comes</b> to town, and the ambitious young man takes advantage of the offer. Despite George's family relationship to the Eastmans, they regard him as something of an outsider, but his uncle nevertheless offers him an entry-level job at his factory. George, uncomplaining, hopes to impress his uncle (whom he addresses as [...] "Mr. Eastman") with his hard work and earn his way up. While working in the factory, George starts dating fellow factory worker Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters), in defiance of the workplace rules. Alice is a poor and inexperienced girl who is dazzled by George and slow to believe that his Eastman name brings him no advantages.|$|E
2500|$|Reviews of The Itchy & Scratchy Game {{have been}} {{generally}} negative, with much criticism being {{directed at the}} gameplay. Reviewing the Genesis version, GamePro commented that [...] "If the video game industry <b>ever</b> <b>comes</b> crashing down, Itchy and Scratchy will be {{near the top of}} the 'Blame Us' list." [...] They cited the overly easy gameplay and absence of the excessive violence and theme song which made Itchy and Scratchy popular. A different GamePro reviewer made similar remarks of the Game Gear version, and further criticized it for its [...] "grainy" [...] sound and for omitting the boss battles of the console version. Game Players gave the SNES version a 35/100 rating in March 1995, commenting that the [...] "gameplay suffers from extensive repetition and poor control and, despite the large number of weapons included in the game, there are too few opportunities to pick them up." [...] Reviewing the SNES version, GamePro criticized the [...] "mindless" [...] gameplay, drab graphics, and tiresome animations, but concluded that [...] "the control is the worst part. In a game of jumping and hitting, the lack of jumping attacks and the inaccurate weapons make you itch for a different game." ...|$|E
