But cognitive and social schemas are complementary rather than competitive, and purely social <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> scientific change are as inadequate as purely cognitive explanations. For example, cognitive <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chemical revolution must be supplemented by and combined with social explanations, and social <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mechanical world view must be supplemented by and combined with cognitive <b>explanations.</b> Rational appraisal <b>of</b> cognitive and social strategies for improving knowledge should appreciate <b>the</b> interdependence <b>of</b> mind and society...|$|R

5|$|The Flight Superintendent and the Technical Superintendent of ANA {{simulated}} some {{of these}} events during a test flight in another DC-4. They were satisfied that the time intervals between events were compatible with the likely sequence of events leading to {{the crash of the}} Amana, and that it was a plausible <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident. However, on legal advice this possible <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crash was not made public. Two accidents involving Douglas DC-4s, one approaching Dublin Airport, Ireland, in 1961 and another approaching Stockport Airport, Manchester, United Kingdom, in 1967 were attributed to interruption of fuel supply when engines were supplied from the cross-feed system which was open to an empty fuel tank, allowing air to be drawn into the cross-feed pipe.|$|E
5|$|The UK {{parenting}} site Mumsnet {{had several}} user accounts hijacked, and its CEO was impersonated. The site later published an <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident {{saying it was}} due to Heartbleed and the technical staff patched it promptly.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} and months after {{conclusion}} of the Inquiry one possible <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crash began to circulate among employees of ANA. This possibility began with one piece of evidence uncovered by the Inquiry during cross-examination of ANA's ground staff. It was reported that after sunrise the morning after the crash the one-gallon container used to check Amana's fuel filters was found empty and lying on its side on the apron a short distance from where Amana had been parked. The Inquiry attached no significance to this evidence and did not explore it further.|$|E

5|$|Jerry Fodor, Putnam, {{and others}} noted that, along with being an {{effective}} argument against type-identity theories, multiple realizability implies that any low-level explanation of higher-level mental phenomena is insufficiently abstract and general. Functionalism, which identifies mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively {{in terms of}} causes and effects, abstracts from the level of microphysics, and therefore {{seemed to be a}} better <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relation between mind and body. In fact, there are many functional kinds, such as mousetraps, software and bookshelves, which are multiply realized at the physical level.|$|E

5|$|Related to the {{argument}} from morality is {{the argument}} from conscience, associated with eighteenth-century bishop Joseph Butler and nineteenth-century cardinal John Henry Newman. Newman proposed that the conscience, as well as giving moral guidance, provides evidence of objective moral truths which must be supported by the divine. He argued that emotivism is an inadequate <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human experience of morality because people avoid acting immorally, even when it might be in their interests. Newman proposed that, to explain the conscience, God must exist.|$|E
5|$|The Catechism {{explains}} that this commandment regulates worldly goods, and forbids unjustly taking, using or damaging those {{that belong to}} someone else. It places requirements upon those who possess worldly goods to use them responsibly, taking into consideration the good of society.

The Ardhanarisvara concept co-mingles god Shiva and goddess Shakti by presenting an icon that is half man and half woman, a representation and theme of union found in many Hindu texts and temples.|$|E

5|$|The first, indirect, {{detection}} of gravitational waves {{came in the}} 1970s through observation {{of a pair of}} closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16.

Einstein's prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at LIGO published the first observation of gravitational waves, on Earth, exactly one hundred years after the prediction.|$|E
5|$|The mind–body problem {{concerns}} the <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship {{that exists between}} minds, or mental processes, and bodily states or processes.

5|$|The third story {{describes}} Parvati being banished by Shiva {{when she}} becomes momentarily distracted {{while listening to}} his <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vedas.

The fishermen often face problems due to a giant shark that disrupts their way of life. Shiva asserts that he alone can defeat the shark. After a long battle, Shiva subdues the shark (which is actually Nandi in disguise) and remarries Parvati.|$|E
