5|$|The novel extrapolates Balzac's {{analysis}} of desire {{from the individual}} to society; he feared that the world, like Valentin, was losing its way due to material excess and misguided priorities. In the <b>gambling</b> <b>house,</b> the orgiastic feast, the antique shop, and the discussions with men of science, Balzac examines this dilemma in various contexts. The lust for social status to which Valentin is led by Rastignac is emblematic of this excess; the gorgeous but unattainable Foedora symbolizes the pleasures offered by high society.|$|E
5|$|While in Alaska, Wyatt rubbed elbows {{with future}} novelist Rex Beach, writer Jack London, playwright Wilson Mizner, and boxing {{promoter}} Tex Rickard, with whom Earp developed a long-lasting relationship. Rickard was {{a partner in}} the Northern Saloon and <b>gambling</b> <b>house</b> in Nome. Both the Dexter and the Northern Saloon competed for business with more than 60 other saloons in town serving an estimated 20,000 residents. Wyatt was arrested twice in Nome for minor offenses, including being drunk and disorderly, although he was not tried. Most members of law enforcement were corrupt or otherwise engaged.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the novel}} uses fantastic elements, its main focus is a {{realistic}} {{portrayal of the}} excesses of bourgeois materialism. Balzac's renowned attention to detail is used to describe a <b>gambling</b> <b>house,</b> an antique shop, a royal banquet, and other locales. He also includes details from his own life as a struggling writer, placing the main character in a home {{similar to the one}} he occupied at the start of his literary career. The central theme of La Peau de chagrin is the conflict between desire and longevity. The magic skin represents the owner's life-force, which is depleted through every expression of will, especially when it is employed for the acquisition of power. Ignoring a caution from the shopkeeper who offers him the skin, the protagonist greedily surrounds himself with wealth, only to find himself miserable and decrepit at the story's end.|$|E

The site had been a popular nightspot and illegal <b>gambling</b> <b>house</b> as early as 1926; Ohio native Dean Martin had been a blackjack dealer there.

500|$|The title La Peau de chagrin first {{appeared}} in print on 9 December 1830, as a passing mention in an article Balzac wrote for La Caricature under the pseudonym Alfred Coudreux.

[...] ("The invention of a skin that represents life. Oriental story.") One week later, he published a story fragment called [...] "Le Dernier Napoléon" [...] in La Caricature, under the name [...] "HenriB...". In it, a young man loses his last Napoleon coin at a Parisian <b>gambling</b> <b>house,</b> then continues to the Pont Royal to drown himself. During this early stage, Balzac did not think much of the project. He {{referred to it as}} [...] "a piece of thorough nonsense in the literary sense, but in which [...] has sought to introduce certain of the situations in this hard life through which men of genius have passed before achieving anything". Before long, though, his opinion of the story improved.|$|E
