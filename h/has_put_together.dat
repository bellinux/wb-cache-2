Hansen said that [...] "Gore <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> a coherent account of a complex topic that Americans desperately need to understand. The story is scientifically accurate and yet should be understandable to the public, a public that is less and less drawn to science." [...] He added that with An Inconvenient Truth, [...] "Al Gore may have done for global warming what Silent Spring did for pesticides. He will be attacked, but the public will have the information needed to distinguish our long-term well-being from short-term special interests." ...|$|E
500|$|Appeal to Reason {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. It received {{a score of}} 65 out of 100 on Metacritic's average of ten professional reviews. In his review giving the album an 82% rating, Chris Fallon of AbsolutePunk.net said, [...] "Appeal to Reason is essentially focused on one big thing: intelligence. There is no fluff here -- the band <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> a fast, smart and generally focused piece of work here." [...] Rolling Stone magazine tells of the band's further emergence into the mainstream with Appeal to Reason, [...] "Rise Against may be nervous about leaving the underground behind, but with sharp songs like these, they're ready {{for the rest of}} the world." ...|$|E

She wrote, [...] "It's {{sort of like a}} really expanded Wikipedia entry, if you like that type of thing, though Herbert's voice shows that she's definitely a fan, and the book isn't completely unbiasedit's a very revering [...] tale of Gaga's 24-year-old life." [...] Sharon Galligar Chance reviewed the book for the Las Vegas Review-Journal, and wrote, [...] "Using references from many, many different sources, Herbert <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> a fairly solid biography of the new pop icon". She concluded her review saying, [...] "Although sometimes redundant, Herbert...does give the reader a full-bodied accounting of the persona behind Lady Gaga".|$|E

500|$|In 1982, Mike Ilitch {{bought the}} team from Bruce Norris. Ilitch hired Jim Devellano from the New York Islanders to replace Skinner as GM; [...] Devellano {{had served as a}} scout and {{assistant}} general manager with the Islanders, where he won the Stanley Cup three times. [...] Under his leadership the Red Wings began a new era of success; in 1983 they drafted Steve Yzerman, who spent his entire career in Detroit, including a league record 20 years as team captain. [...] The Red Wings returned to the playoffs in 1984 where they suffered a first round defeat to the St. Louis Blues. The team reached the Western Conference finals in both 1987 and 1988, losing to the Edmonton Oilers both times. Devellano became team vice president in 1990, handing over the general manager position to Bryan Murray for the 1990–91 season. [...] The club made the playoffs that season and every season since; with Bryan Murray from 1990 to 1994, Devellano and head coach Scotty Bowman sharing general manager responsbilites from 1994 to 1997, and current general manager Ken Holland, the team <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> of a streak of 25 consecutive playoff appearances from 1991 to 2016.

500|$|Time {{magazine}} writer James Poniewozik {{said the}} episode continued {{the development of}} the town of Pawnee, which he said was like a character itself and compared it to The Simpsons Springfield. Poniewozik said [...] "Media Blitz" [...] also showed how well integrated Scott has become with the cast, and called the [...] "Crazy Ira and The Douche" [...] interview [...] "maybe the most perfect scene P <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> yet". Likewise, Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called Ben's interview with Perd Hapley [...] "one of the best scenes Parks & Rec has ever done". Heisler enjoyed how the series gradually built up Ben Wyatt's backstory throughout the season, [...] "then took it way over-the-top". However, he expressed disappointment that the Ann and Chris subplot ended with no resolution. Zap2it writer Rick Porter, called the episode a [...] "great showcase for Scott's deadpan gifts" [...] and wrote, [...] "This show hasn't had a real miss yet this season." [...] Porter said the April and Andy subplot was less interesting, but he enjoyed the scenes between Ron and Andy. Steve Kandell of New York magazine praised the episode for bringing Scott's character to the forefront, as well as for providing satire on small-town politics without coming across as preachy. Kandell said of the April and Andy story, [...] "If their kiss at the shoeshine stand, as expected and inevitable as it may have been, didn't make your heart soar just a little bit, then you're dead inside and probably just turned on NBC for Outsourced a few minutes early." [...] Joel Keller of TV Squad complimented Scott, calling him a [...] "current-generation Bob Newhart" [...] and [...] "one of those actors who can just give someone a look and it conveys {{everything you need to know}} about what his character is thinking". Keller said he also enjoyed seeing April and Andy reconcile, but felt the Crazy Ira and The Douche scene was ineffective because, regarding morning zoo radio shows, [...] "it's hard to parody something that's already a parody of itself".|$|E

Lima gave it four stars writing, [...] "Bunn <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> an interesting team and this issue is considerably better than issue #2. I for one am definitely {{looking forward to the}} continuation of this series." [...] Grey gave it a 7.9 writing, [...] "Cullen Bunn ties together more than a few loose plot threads in The Fearless Defenders #3." ...|$|E

Diniz started his season with a finish in Australia and later suffered from consecutive retirements {{in the next five}} races. He managed to finish eighth in Canada, before picking up further consecutive retirements in the next four races. Diniz managed to secure a seventh-place finish in Belgium, before suffering a further retirement in Italy. He managed to secure finishes in the next three consecutive races, which included a points scoring finish at the Luxembourg Grand Prix and retired from the final race of the season at the European Grand Prix. In October, Arrows announced that Diniz had signed a one-year extension to his contract, remaining with the team for 1998. Diniz finished the season in sixteenth place in the Drivers' Championship, with two points, and finished four places behind team-mate Hill.|$|E
2500|$|Writing in The Guardian on 18 October, Powell {{asserted}} {{that due to}} the Falklands War, [...] "Britain no longer looked upon itself and the world through American spectacles" [...] and the view was [...] "more rational; and it was more congenial; for, after all, it was our own view". He quoted an observation that Americans thought their country was [...] "a unique society... where God <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> all nationalities, races and interests of the globe for one purpose-–to show {{the rest of the}} world how to live". He denounced the [...] "manic exaltation of the American illusion" [...] and compared it to the [...] "American nightmare". Powell also disliked the American belief that [...] "they are authorised, possibly by the deity, to intervene, openly or covertly, in the internal affairs of other countries anywhere in the world". Britain should dissociate herself from American intervention in the Lebanon: [...] "It is not in Britain's self-interest alone that Britain should once again assert her own position. A world in which the American myth and the American nightmare go unchallenged by question or by contradiction is not a world as safe or as peaceable as human reason, prudence and realism can make it".|$|E

David Smith scored the PlayStation 2 version 9.4 out of 10, giving it an [...] "Editor's Award" [...] and calling the Dark Alliance engine [...] "one of the best 3D engines yet devised." [...] He dismissed criticisms of the game as a [...] "Diablo clone," [...] arguing the gameplay is much deeper than such a comparison suggests. His only criticisms were some anti-climatic boss fights and repetitive music. He concluded [...] "There is honestly {{not a great deal}} to complain about here [...] Snowblind <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> one of the best engines on PS2 {{and one of the best}} hacks in the business, certainly the best a console has ever seen." [...] Kaiser Hwang scored the Xbox version 8.5 out of 10. He praised the graphics, but wrote [...] "What hurts this game's score is the fact that it is almost exactly the same game that was released last year, not that that's a bad thing. The game is a fine example of exceptional game-making. But an extra level or character, or really any added extras would've been great." [...] Fran Mirabella III scored the GameCube version 7.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "a downgrade from the PS2 version." [...] He criticized the [...] "bafflingly destroyed frame rate," [...] and commented [...] "When it was released on the PS2 a year ago, few could believe what Snowblind had pulled off on Sony's stubborn console. A year later, and quite magically, High Voltage couldn't get the engine running smoothly on GameCube." [...] Craig Harris scored the Game Boy Advance version 8 out of 10, arguing that [...] "Even though it's missing a few key elements from the original design it's based upon, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance works out very well in portable form." ...|$|E

60|$|First. Whenever {{any state}} of {{consciousness}} has once been excited in us, no matter by what cause, an inferior degree of the same {{state of consciousness}}, a state of consciousness resembling the former, but inferior in intensity, is capable of being reproduced in us, without the presence of any such cause as excited it at first. Thus, if we have once seen or touched an object, we can afterward think of the object though it be absent from our sight or from our touch. If we have been joyful or grieved at some event, {{we can think of}} or remember our past joy or grief, though no new event of a happy or painful nature has taken place. When a poet <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> a mental picture of an imaginary object, a Castle of Indolence, a Una, or a Hamlet, he can afterward think of the ideal object he has created, without any fresh act of intellectual combination. This law is expressed by saying, in the language of Hume, that every mental impression has its idea.|$|E
60|$|But {{the voice}} of archaeological and {{historical}} criticism {{still has to be}} heard; and it gives forth no uncertain sound. The marvellous recovery of the records of an antiquity, far superior to any that can be ascribed to the Pentateuch, which has been effected by the decipherers of cuneiform characters, has put us in possession of a series, once more, not of speculations, but of facts, which have a most remarkable bearing upon the question of the truthworthiness of the narrative of the Flood. It is established, that for centuries before the asserted migration of Terah from Ur of the Chaldees (which, according to the orthodox interpreters of the Pentateuch, took place after the year 2000 B.C.) Lower Mesopotamia was the seat of a civilisation in which art and science and literature had attained a development formerly unsuspected or, if there were faint reports of it, treated as fabulous. And it is also no matter of speculation, but a fact, that the libraries of these people contain versions of a long epic poem, one of the twelve books of which tells a story of a deluge, which, in a number of its leading features, corresponds with the story attributed to Berosus, no less than with the story given in Genesis, with curious exactness. Thus, the correctness of Canon Rawlinson's conclusion, cited above, that the story of Berosus was neither drawn from the Hebrew record, nor is the foundation of it, can hardly be questioned. It is highly probable, if not certain, that Berosus relied upon one of the versions (for there seem to have been several) of the old Babylonian epos, extant in his time; and, if that is a reasonable conclusion, why is it unreasonable to believe that the two stories, which the Hebrew compiler <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> in such an inartistic fashion, were ultimately derived from the same source? I say ultimately, because it does not at all follow that the two versions, possibly trimmed by the Jehovistic writer on the one hand, and by the Elohistic on the other, to suit Hebrew requirements, may not have been current among the Israelites for ages. And they may have acquired great authority before they were combined in the Pentateuch.|$|E
