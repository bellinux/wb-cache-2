60|$|The ship {{rolled and}} pitched so violently {{that he could}} not stand alone for an instant. If he {{attempted}} to do so, he would be thrown against {{one side or the other}} of the cabin or passage way by the most sudden and unaccountable impulses. He finally succeeded in getting up upon the main deck, where he went into the enclosed space which has already been described. This space was closely shut up now on all sides. There were, however, two doors which led from it out upon the deck. In order to go up upon the promenade deck, it was necessary to go out at one of these doors, and then ascend the promenade <b>deck</b> <b>stairway.</b> Rollo had, however, no intention of doing this, though he thought that perhaps he might open one of the doors a little and look out.|$|E

5000|$|... The Boat Deck level gave {{access to}} the outside {{promenade}} space, sun deck, the lifeboats, and the adjoining Gymnasium. The A-Deck level accessed First Class accommodation at the forward part {{of the ship and}} the grand public rooms located further aft via a long corridor. Entry vestibules opened onto the encircling Promenade <b>Deck</b> from the <b>stairway.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 15 January 2013, the ban was {{extended}} to all common areas of the residential block including linkways from bus stops to residential blocks, void <b>decks,</b> corridors, stairwells, <b>stairways</b> and multi-purpose halls, in addition to covered walkways and linkways, all pedestrian overhead bridges, 5 m from the bus stops and hospital outdoor compounds. However, the residential block smoking ban was not mandatory as {{there are more people}} smoking except when during wakes or funerals.|$|R
25|$|Ben-my-Chree's {{design was}} very much suited to the Edwardian era. Her five decks {{consisted}} of lower, main, shelter, promenade and boat decks, and offered ample room for her passengers. The promenade deck extended over two-thirds of the vessel's length. Above the promenade deck was the boat deck, extending over half of her length and affording ample shelter to passengers during inclement weather. The shelter deck was carried right fore and aft, and on each side there was a fine promenade. The centre of this deck consisted of cabins and public rooms while on the two decks below (the main and lower) there were additional public saloons. The first class passengers occupied the forward part {{of the ship and}} the second class the after part. There was a wide companionway forward allowing access to all <b>decks</b> via <b>stairways.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When {{the captain}} {{learned of the}} fire, he {{attempted}} to close the bulkhead fire doors on Deck 3. The fire doors were not configured for fully automatic closing and did not respond since emergency alarms near the doors had not been manually triggered by passengers or crew. A vehicle storage area ventilated by large fans to remove exhaust fumes was also located nearby, and the fans pulled air through an improperly secured fire door and caused rapid fire progress from Deck 3 through Deck 4 and <b>Deck</b> 5 via <b>stairways</b> located on either end.|$|R
50|$|Blue deck {{is similar}} to red deck. Forward are four club cabins that show a view over the ships bow. The rest of the cabins are Standard inside and outside cabins. In the centre of this <b>deck</b> is the <b>stairway</b> lobby which {{has access to the}} large {{promenade}} deck outside. This promenade deck is on port and starboard sides and extends for half of the ship's length. The section aft of this room is the Moonlight Lounge, which features a pianist singing jazz at select times. The aftermost part of this deck is the promenade deck.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe feasibility of {{a concept of}} operation to reduce the manpower required during shipboard sensor calibration is investigated in this thesis. The proposed calibration process takes into consideration security concerns and {{the layout of the}} ship whereby cables cannot be laid across <b>decks</b> and <b>stairways.</b> The current calibration process requires at least two technicians, one to read the sensor information displayed on the Machinery Control System (MCS) located on one deck and another to man the reference sensor installed on a different deck. In this thesis, IEEE 802. 11 wireless LAN in connection with a Keyboard Video Monitor (KVM) switch is proposed to transmit the sensor information displayed on the MCS to the technician manning the reference sensor, reducing the required manpower to one. The range and number of repeaters used to extend the wireless network is investigated in this thesis to determine the feasibility of this concept of operation. From the experimental results, we concluded that the proposed concept of operation is feasible for calibration processes that rely on steady-state readings rather than transient responses.

40|$|Shipping, {{fishing and}} {{exploration}} activities in Arctic waters are endangered by ice accretion on critical structures causing various safety risks. Ulmatec Pyro {{have developed an}} anti-icing/de-icing system using waste heat circulation in a double pipe system, for hand railings, helicopter <b>decks</b> and <b>stairway</b> applications. The research objectives of this master thesis was to support Ulmatec Pyro in the design process, using theoretical models for design optimization, and to develop experimental facilities to verify their designs to meet the IMO Polar Code for ships operating in Arctic areas. The {{first part of the}} project investigated relevant literature and research on icing mechanisms and de-icing technologies. Atmospheric icing is a known problem for mobile units such as airplanes. However, marine icing is more complex since it involves saline water. Further, the marine icing process is more unpredictable with a periodic behavior caused by the weather conditions. Two different numerical models are developed, based on previous icing studies and combined with basic thermo- and fluid- dynamics. First, a simple 1 -dimensional steady state anti-icing model was developed using finite difference method (FDM) and lumped capacitance method (LCM). This model programmed in MATLAB code, is made for a given symmetrical double pipe geometry, and shows good correlations with experimental tests. The second model is made in COMSOL Multiphysics, where 2 -dimensional axisymmetric geometry is used. This model is able to handle transient as well as steady state conditions. The purpose of this model was to simulate de-icing processes. Comparing the steady state results, the CFD model and the simple 1 D model shows good correlations. The transient de-icing simulations results give good results within the assumptions that the water is entrapped in the ice. However, the de-icing experiments show that this model must be modified to give more realistic ice-melting behavior. These modifications include water draining giving insulation air layers between ice and pipe surface, and further include saline ice models. An experimental setup was designed and built for validating theoretical models, and further as a design verification lab for Ulmatec Pyro. The test lab was built inside a commercial freezing container, which turned out to have insufficient freezing capacity for the extreme Polar test conditions. Despite of these limitations, a series of experiments were conducted, providing valuable insight in the icing- and anti-icing processes. The experiments also showed that double pipes gave a more uniform surface temperature than a single pipe, and that it is favorable with a higher flow velocity in the annulus between the inner and outer pipe. The experiments confirm that the double pipe technology is giving a more uniform surface temperature along the pipe compared to a single pipe. Hence, a more efficient use of waterborne heat. The experiments also provided good validation of the theoretical simulation models within the available test conditions. De-icing tests also showed the complexity of the ice melting process. Hence, it gave {{a better understanding of the}} de-icing process and that more complex simulation models are needed. The experiments also provided valuable experience and information needed to upgrade the test rig for further testing with more extreme Polar conditions...|$|R
