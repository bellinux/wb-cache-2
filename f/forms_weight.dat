Construction design of the crane was developed in cooperation with the K-TECHNIK company, which carried out the production and installation of the crane bridge and the crane runway. The basic required parameters of the crane are: load capacity 8 000 kg, range 16 900 mm, minimum lift 4 650 mm. The crane, which construction is proposed in this thesis will be used for the exchange of forms of injection molding machines. The <b>forms</b> <b>weight</b> is about 7 000 kg.

40|$|Extrapolation {{methods are}} reliable, objective, inexpensive, quick, and easily automated. As a result, they are widely used, {{especially}} for inventory and production forecasts, for operational planning {{for up to}} two years ahead, and for long-term forecasts in some situations, such as population forecasting. This paper provides principles for selecting and preparing data, making seasonal adjustments, extrapolating, assessing uncertainty, and identifying when to use extrapolation. The principles are based on received wisdom (i. e., experts ’ commonly held opinions) and on empirical studies. Some of the more important principles are: • In selecting and preparing data, use all relevant data and adjust the data for important events that occurred in the past. • Make seasonal adjustments only when seasonal effects are expected and only if there is good evidence by which to measure them. • In extrapolating, use simple functional <b>forms.</b> <b>Weight</b> the most recent data heavily if there are small measurement errors, stable series, and short forecast horizons.

40|$|Two {{numerical}} methods, Decision Analysis (DA) and Potential Problem Analysis (PPA) {{are presented}} as alternative selection methods to the logical method presented in Part I. In DA properties are weighted and outcomes are scored. The weighted scores for each candidate are totaled and final selection {{is based on the}} totals. Higher scores indicate better candidates. In PPA potential problems are assigned a seriousness factor and test outcomes are used to define the probability of occurrence. The seriousness-probability products are totaled and forms with minimal scores are preferred. DA and PPA have never been compared to the logical-elimination method. Additional data were available for two forms of McN- 5707 to provide complete preformulation data for five candidate <b>forms.</b> <b>Weight</b> and seriousness factors (independent variables) were obtained from a survey of experienced formulators. Scores and probabilities (dependent variables) were provided independently by Preformulation. The rankings of the five candidate forms, best to worst, were similar for all three methods.
