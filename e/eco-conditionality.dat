40|$|The current {{reform of}} the EC Agricultural Policy decouples {{subsidies}} from production and introduces the new concept of “eco-conditionality” which makes the receipt of subsidies contingent on compliance {{with a number of}} environmental standards. this reform, put in place by the Commission, involves a high risk that the cultivation of some Mediterranean products will be abandoned. Their producers will have to meet the challenge of competitiveness and avail themselves of appropriate mechanisms such as codes of good agricultural practices and the application of efficient management systems. <b>Eco-conditionality,</b> EC Agricultural Policy Reform, Indicators, Sustainability, Continuous improvement, Benchmarking. ...|$|E
40|$|The European Common Agricultural Policy is {{shifting}} an increasing {{part of the}} subsidies to <b>eco-conditionality.</b> Henceforth, it becomes essential to evaluate the environmental effect of agricultural practices, and more generally performances of cropping and farming systems, in order to design and to develop more sustainable systems. This assessment is being implemented for the main cropping systems of some French regions, using environmental indicators. Eleven exposure indicators were chosen in order to represent {{a wide range of}} specific sustainability objectives dealing with water, soil, air, non-renewable resources, biodiversity, and landscape. The results present the sustainability assessment for the crop rotations of Champagne Berrichonne region in the Centre of France...|$|E
40|$|Residue {{chopping}} from orchard pruning {{is becoming}} a common practice in conservation agriculture after the establishment of <b>eco-conditionality</b> policies in the European Union. This type of residue is used to protect the soil from erosion and improve the water balance and fertility of soils by improving the organic matter content. However, no studies have evaluated the influence of pruning residues and size on soil coverage. This study examines the effect of different treatments on pruning residue soil coverage in an olive orchard (cv. Picual). Treatments consisted of two quantities of pruning residues, specifically, high (2. 04 kg m- 2) and low (1. 02 kg m- 2), and two chopping speeds, low (2. 4 km h- 1) and high (3. 2 km h- 1). The different treatments were evaluated by image analysis and pixel counting to determine the soil cover percentage, size, number and distribution of the pruning residues after chopping. After chopping, the soil cover percentage was 39 % higher in the high quantity pruning residue treatments but was not significantly influenced by the chopping speed. The size and number of lignified residues was quantified via pixel counting. In the high quantity pruning residue treatments, the number of large lignified residues (> 6 cm 2) was higher, {{and the number of}} pruning residues smaller than 2 cm 2 was lower, when compared with low quantity pruning residue treatments. The high chopping speed treatments produced more smaller-sized pruning residues...|$|E
