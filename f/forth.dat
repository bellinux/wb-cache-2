5|$|The <b>Forth</b> Road Bridge is a {{suspension}} bridge in east central Scotland. The bridge, opened in 1964, spans the Firth of <b>Forth,</b> connecting Edinburgh, at Queensferry, to Fife, at North Queensferry. It replaced a centuries-old ferry service to carry vehicular traffic, cyclists and pedestrians across the Forth; railway crossings {{are made by}} the adjacent <b>Forth</b> Bridge, opened in 1890.|$|E
5|$|The Islands of the <b>Forth</b> are a {{group of}} small islands located in the Firth of <b>Forth</b> and in the estuary of the River <b>Forth</b> {{on the east coast}} of Scotland. Most of the group lie in the open waters of the firth, between the Lothians and Fife, with the {{majority}} to the east of the city of Edinburgh. Two islands lie further west in the river estuary.|$|E
5|$|Alloa Inch is {{an island}} in the tidal reaches of the River <b>Forth</b> near Alloa that {{consists}} of reed beds and salt marshes. There is a derelict farmhouse on the island and the Scottish Wildlife Trust has managed the island as a nature reserve since 1996. Just upstream is the smaller Tullibody Inch - both are part of the Firth of <b>Forth</b> SSSI, which also includes the John Muir Country Park.|$|E

5|$|<b>Forth</b> Valley Royal Hospital is a {{hospital}} located in Larbert, Scotland. With 860inpatient beds, 25wards, and 16operating theatres, it was Scotland's largest ever NHS construction {{project at the}} time but has been surpassed by the New Southern General hospital amongst others. Built {{at a cost of}} £300million {{on the site of the}} old Royal Scottish National Hospital, it opened to its first patients in 2010. It is operated by NHS <b>Forth</b> Valley.|$|E

5|$|His {{reputation}} destroyed, Bouch died in October 1880. Work on {{the suspension}} bridge he had designed {{to cross the}} Firth of <b>Forth</b> was stopped after the Tay Bridge collapse and Barlow, Sir John Fowler and Thomas Elliot Harrison, consultant engineers for the three railway companies involved in the construction, were asked to choose a replacement design. The solution was the cantilevered <b>Forth</b> Bridge by Fowler and Sir Benjamin Baker.|$|E

5|$|Radio Royal is the {{hospital}} radio {{service for the}} <b>Forth</b> Valley, broadcasting from studios at the <b>Forth</b> Valley Royal Hospital. It operates two radio stations, Radio Royal and Royal 2, 24 hours a day seven days a week, staffed {{by a team of}} around 50 volunteers. Founded in 1976, it originally broadcast from the old Royal Scottish National Hospital in Larbert. It was latterly based at Falkirk Royal Infirmary, before returning to Larbert on the opening of <b>Forth</b> Valley Royal. Radio Royal can be heard in the <b>Forth</b> Valley Royal Hospital restaurant, clinic waiting areas and refuge points. In-patients can listen via their bedside entertainment units on Freeview channels 8, 800 or 603. Radio Royal is available on the internet via www.radioroyal.org and through the Radio Royal App, available to download for free for Apple and Android devices.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of {{construction}} the hospital was Scotland's largest ever NHS construction project, cost £300million to build, most of which was provided by a private finance initiative arrangement; it {{was built on the}} site of the old Royal Scottish National Hospital. Originally to be called <b>Forth</b> Valley Hospital, it was granted royal status by Queen Elizabeth II, becoming <b>Forth</b> Valley Royal Hospital. It was hoped the new hospital would be ready by 2009, but medical services did not start to be transferred until August 2010, when the first patients were admitted. The process was completed in June 2011, and the queen officially opened the hospital on 6July 2011.|$|E

5|$|Besieged {{forces would}} {{sometimes}} launch sorties {{in an attempt}} to fire the attackers' camps or equipment. When Hugh Capet besieged Laon in 986–987, his troops became drunk one night, and Duke Charles's men sallied <b>forth</b> and torched the camp, forcing Hugh to abandon the siege.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s {{these had}} fallen into disuse, and the locks were {{dismantled}} in 1933. The <b>Forth</b> and Clyde Canal closed {{at the end of}} 1962, and by the mid-1970s the Union Canal was filled in at both ends, rendered impassable by culverts in two places and run in pipes under a housing estate. The British Waterways Board (BWB) came into existence on 1 January 1963, the day the <b>Forth</b> and Clyde Canal was closed, with the objective of finding a broad strategy for the future of canals in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{commenced}} in {{the summer}} of 1898 under the direction of Sir Benjamin Baker (who co-designed the <b>Forth</b> Bridge), W.R. Galbraith and R.F. Church. The works were carried out by Perry & Company of Tregedar Works, Bow.|$|E
5|$|Each {{in their}} own way is making the same point, that Bewick's work is more than mere illustration. Its liveliness and truth to {{experience}} appeals to the imagination of the reader and calls <b>forth</b> an individual response that goes beyond the text.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, the BWB decided after {{a meeting}} with local councils that the <b>Forth</b> and Clyde Canal, {{fragmented}} by various developments, was to have its remaining navigability preserved by building new bridges with sufficient headroom for boats and continuing to maintain the existing locks. Restoration of sea-to-sea navigation was deemed too expensive at the time, but {{there were to be}} no further restrictions on its use. A 1979 survey report documented 69 obstructions to navigation, and sought the opinions of twenty interested parties to present the <b>Forth</b> and Clyde Local (Subject) Plan in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{traffic levels}} across the Firth of <b>Forth</b> had {{also led to}} the {{construction}} of the Clackmannanshire Bridge adjacent to the existing Kincardine Bridge. This bridge opened in November 2008.|$|E

5|$|Since the 18th century, {{scholars}} have occasionally put <b>forth</b> that Jesus {{was a political}} national messiah, but the evidence for this portrait is negligible. Likewise, the proposal that Jesus was a Zealot does not fit with the earliest strata of the Synoptic tradition.|$|E

5|$|The Commons {{discussed}} the Munich Agreement on 3 October. Though Cooper opened by setting <b>forth</b> {{the reasons for}} his resignation and Churchill spoke harshly against the pact, no Conservative voted against the government.

5|$|The Scottish Parliament {{voted to}} scrap tolls {{on the bridge}} from February 2008. The bridge was {{nearing the end of}} its life in the 2010s, and a {{parallel}} replacement was built. On 5September 2017 the bridge carried its final private cars, as the vast majority of traffic was transferred to the new Queensferry Crossing. Following a few weeks closure for repairs, the new role of the <b>Forth</b> Road Bridge will be as a public transport corridor, open only to buses, taxis, cyclists and pedestrians. At its peak, the <b>Forth</b> Road Bridge carried 65,000 vehicles per day (vpd), which is now expected to drop to only a few hundred following the opening of the Queensferry Crossing.|$|E
5|$|The bridge's {{management}} was delegated to the FRBJB, and remained so until 2002 when its operation {{was transferred to}} a new body with a wider remit, the <b>Forth</b> Estuary Transport Authority.|$|E
