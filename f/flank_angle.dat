5000|$|Development of the Thury thread {{began in}} 1876, when the Horological Section of Geneva Society of Arts {{appointed}} {{a committee to}} look into the requirements for a uniform thread standard for use in Horological arts in Switzerland. Professor Thury began his studies by collecting and measuring samples of screws made by nine independent screw and screw tackle manufacturers in Switzerland. The Thury thread form was developed in 1878, thirty-seven years after the British Standard Whitworth thread form was designed in England and fourteen years after the United States Standard thread was presented in the United States. However, unlike these two predecessors, the Thury thread was designed for small-diameter screws which were then produced with screw plates. This production technique mandated that the Thury thread form have rounded crests and roots. Thread forms with rounded or [...] "radiused" [...] crests and roots like the Thury and Whitworth thread generate smaller stress risers than those forms like the American National or ISO metric which have truncated roots and crests; in modern engineering this is particularly important factor when tapping holes in acrylic plastic, where a larger stress riser can lead to an earlier onset of crack formation. The Thury thread is unusual in having a comparatively small 47.5° thread <b>flank</b> <b>angle,</b> which was chosen to make fabrication easier and to achieve greater holding capacity than screws with larger flank angles. Screws in the Thury thread system are given nominal sizes, with the base size [...] "0" [...] being six millimeters in diameter and having a thread pitch of one millimeter. Sizes are proportional, so a size [...] "1" [...] is ten percent smaller in diameter that a size [...] "0", while a size -1 is ten percent larger than a size [...] "0". The Thury thread was {{believed to be the first}} thread form to solve the problem of creating a single system of screw dimensions applicable to all sizes. The relationship between the pitch P of a Thury screw and its diameter D is expressed by the equation D=6P5/6. Another variable Thury standardized is the thread depth, which had until then been variable when cutting threads in different materials. The proliferation of the Thury standard was hindered when in 1882, the British Science Association produced a committee report on the consideration of a standard screw gauge, where they declined to accept the Thury thread but instead chose to use the Whitworth thread standard previously designed by committee member Joseph Whitworth, in part because the Whitworth form was historically successful and because the committee did not believe England was prepared to use a metric thread as its standard. However, the committee recognized the validity of many of the design aspects of the Thury thread, and a mere two years later published their specifications for the British Association (BA) thread. The BA committee made only slight modifications to the rounding radii of Thury thread and gave specifications rounded to the nearest mil.|$|E

Buttress (nearly zero <b>flank</b> <b>angle),</b> trapezoidal (15 -deg <b>flank</b> <b>angle),</b> and triangular (30 -deg <b>flank</b> <b>angle)</b> thread forms are examined {{in combination with}} standard and lip-type nuts.

The improvement is roughly a 20 -percent reduction in the stress concentration factor from the trapezoidal to the buttress thread. In the case of lip nut, conversely, this tendency is somewhat reversed, with the trapezoidal thread performing slightly (but not decidedly) {{better than the other}} two shapes.

Simulation of the X- 48 B (The Boeing Company, Chicago, Illinois) aircraft was used to validate the method, ultimately using data derived from wind-tunnel testing to simulate the un-calibrated air data measurements.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the local {{approach}} based on the Notch Stress Intensity Factors (NSIFs) to analyse the fatigue behavior of welded joints. In transverse load carrying fillet-welded joints, failure may occur either at the toe or at the root, depending on the geometry. At the toe, due to the <b>flank</b> <b>angles</b> that are usually encountered in practice, mode I local stresses are singular, while mode II stresses are not. Conversely, {{at the root of}} the particular joints analysed in the present paper both mode I and mode II stresses are singular and must be taken into account in fatigue assessments. Recently, a simplified finite element-based method to readily estimate the mode I NSIF and mode II SIF has been proposed (the so-called Peak Stress Method, PSM). According to the PSM, the mode I NSIF and mode II SIF are proportional to the finite values of the opening and sliding stresses, respectively, evaluated at the point of singularity by means of a finite element analysis, as soon as an appropriate mesh pattern is drawn. In this paper the PSM is first summarized and then applied to assess the fatigue strength of load carrying transverse fillet welds, where competition between toe and root failures exists...|$|R
