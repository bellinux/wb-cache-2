50|$|This use of {{fear and}} {{political}} rhetoric to categorize Latinos in the United States as the “other” helped {{in the creation of}} stereotypes and contributed to ideas that many Latino Americans were treated as though “they were <b>invisible</b> <b>men</b> and women -- part of the landscape, supporting actors in a drama that purported only to affect them, not to be affected by them.
