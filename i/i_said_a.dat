500|$|The {{lyrics to}} the first verse of [...] "Born Again" [...] were written while Third Day's lead singer, Mac Powell, was folding laundry. Powell {{recalled}} that [...] "I was doing some chores at home. I was sitting {{down on the floor}} folding laundry and I had that song in my head. All of a sudden it just came out--a full first verse literally. It wasn’t like <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> line and worked out a few other lines, it literally just came out. I just spoke it and sang it and it scared me because that never happens". Powell said he then [...] "got up and I was running around the house, throwing stuff everywhere looking for a pen and a piece of paper".|$|E
500|$|While {{living in}} England Donen became {{a fan of}} the British variety show Beyond the Fringe and wanted to work with the show's comedy duo Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. The {{resulting}} film was Bedazzled, an updated version of the Faust legend in 1967. It was written by Cook with music by Moore, and also starred Eleanor Bron and Raquel Welch. Moore plays a lonely young man whose unrequited love of his co-worker (Bron) drives him to attempt suicide. Just then the devil (Cook) appears and offers him seven wishes in exchange for his soul. The film's fun-loving association with the Swinging London of the 1960s divided critics, but Roger Ebert called its satire [...] "barbed and contemporary... dry and understated", and overall, a [...] "magnificently photographed, intelligent, very funny film." [...] On the other hand, Time magazine called it the feeblest of all known variations on the Faust theme. The film was a hit and was especially popular among American college students. Donen considered it a favorite among his own films and called it [...] "a very personal film in that <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> great deal about what I think is important in life." [...] It was remade as Bedazzled by director Harold Ramis in 2000.|$|E

6000|$|... "I never <b>said</b> <b>a</b> ghost. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>an</b> apparition. <b>I</b> don't {{know what}} it was. It {{may have been an}} optical delusion. I call it an apparition, because that's the {{shortest}} way out. You know I'm not a spiritualist." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Twenty days {{towards the}} setting sun," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> <b>As</b> he {{remained}} silent I added: [...] "I heard that I could find {{gold in the}} mountains there. An old man told me, {{and we went to}} look for gold." ...|$|R
2500|$|Lulu Terrio-Cameron died {{of breast}} cancer in April 1996. [...] "We had 16 years of blissful happiness," [...] Cameron told a {{journalist}} adding [...] "it was the kind of marriage that every day I felt myself filled with wonder that I had such a person to share my life with. Every day <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> little prayer of thanks." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bundy is {{reported}} to have described these demands as [...] "a revelation that I received." [...] According to Esquire, Bundy told a crowd, [...] "The good Lord said, 'Bundy, it's not your job, it's their job.' ... This morning, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> prayer, and this is what I received. I heard a voice say, 'Sheriff Gillespie, your work is not done. Every sheriff across the United States, take the guns away from the United States bureaucrats." ...|$|E
2500|$|For years afterwards, Frazier {{retained}} his bitterness towards Ali {{and suggested}} that Ali's battle with Parkinson's syndrome {{was a form of}} divine retribution for his earlier behavior. In 2001, Ali apologized to Frazier via a New York Times article, saying [...] "In a way, Joe's right. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> lot of things {{in the heat of the}} moment that I shouldn't have said. Called him names I shouldn't have called him. I apologize for that. I'm sorry. It was all meant to promote the fight". Frazier reportedly [...] "embraced it", though he later retorted that Ali only apologized to a newspaper, not to him. He said: [...] "I'm still waiting [...] to say it to me." [...] To this Ali responded: [...] "If you see Frazier, you tell him he's still a gorilla." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bachmann {{brought up}} the {{interview}} before business leaders and Republicans during a campaign stop in St. Cloud, Minnesota, on October 21, 2008. She stated that she never intended to question Obama's patriotism. [...] "I made a misstatement. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> comment that I would take back. I did not, nor do I, question Barack Obama's patriotism... I {{did not say that}} Barack Obama is anti-American nor do I believe that Barack Obama is anti-American... I'm very concerned about Barack Obama's views. I don't believe that socialism is a good thing for America." [...] However, in March 2010, Bachmann said, [...] "I said I had very serious concerns that Barack Obama had anti-American views—and now I look like Nostradamus" [...] while speaking at a fund-raiser for the Susan B. Anthony List. A year later, in March 2011, Bachmann was asked on Meet the Press if she still believed that Obama held un-American views. She responded [...] "I believe that the actions of this government have, have been emblematic of ones that have not been based on true American values." [...] Pressed for clarification, she said [...] "I've already answered that question before. I said I had very serious concerns about the president's views." ...|$|E

60|$|A fatal question. I {{recognized}} that I was defeated. If I answered no, he {{would cut the}} matter short and wave me to the door without the grace of a word--I saw it in his uncompromising eye; if <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was <b>a</b> lecturer, he would despise me, and dismiss me with opprobrious words; if <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was <b>a</b> dramatist, he would throw {{me out of the}} window.
