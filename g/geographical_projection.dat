50|$|This section {{describes}} {{the principles of}} the radar-scan conversion (RSC) process.The radar supplies its measured data in polar coordinates (ρ,θ) directly from the rotating antenna. ρ defines the target/echo distance and θ the target angle in polar world coordinates. These data are measured, digitized and stored in a polar coordinate polar store or polar pixmap. The main RSC task is to convert these data to Cartesian (x, y) display coordinates, creating the necessary display pixels. The RSC process is influenced by the current zoom, shift and rotation settings defining which part of the 'world' shall be visible in the display image. As detailed later the RSC process also takes the currently used <b>geographical</b> <b>projection</b> into account when the radar video images are Geo Warped.|$|E
50|$|For {{visualization}} on {{a modern}} computer screen the polar coordinates {{have to be}} converted into Cartesian coordinates. This process called radar scan conversion is presented with more detail in the next section.The second problem to solve arises {{from the fact that}} a radar system is placed in the real world and measures real world echo positions. These echoes have to be displayed together with other real world data like object positions, vector maps and satellite images in a consistent way. All this information refers to the curved earth surface but is dis-played on a flat computer display. Building a link from real world earth positions to dis-play pixels is commonly called geographical referencing or in short geo-referencing.Part of the geo-referencing process is to map the 3D earth surface onto a 2D display. This process of a <b>geographical</b> <b>projection</b> can be performed in many ways, but different data sources have their own ‘natural’ projection. E.g. Cartesian radar video data from a radar source on the earth surface are geo-referenced by a so-called radar projection. When using this radar projection the Cartesian radar video pixels can directly displayed on a computer screen (only being linearly transformed according to the current position on the screen and e.g. the current zoom level).A problem now arises if e.g. also a satellite map shall be shown together with the radar video data. The ‘natural’ <b>geographical</b> <b>projection</b> of a satellite image would be a satellite projection which depends on the satellite orbit, position and further parameters. Now either the satellite image has to be reprojected to a radar projection or the radar video has to use the satellite projection. This geographical re-projection is also called geographical warping or Geo Warping where each image pixel has to be transformed from one projection into another.This article describes in further detail the Geo Warping of radar video images in real time. It will also show that radar video Geo Warping is done most efficiently when it is integrated with the radar scan conversion process.|$|E

The Riemannian sphere S² is mapped through the <b>geographical</b> <b>projection</b> from a pole at infinity onto such a complex plane. For dipoles, 0 zero is a second pole. The two points can be mapped to arbitrary points a,b in the complex plane. Concerning WIGRIS W, a 3-dimensional field structure for the 3-dimensional Pauli spin of P was described by Hopf. The three Pauli matrices act as metrical, quadratic forms and map a 3-dimensional sphere onto S² such that the first S² coordinate is the complex dot product, the second the complex cross product, both suitably scaled, and the third coordinate {{can be used for}} a torus description of leptons.

50|$|The Figure Geo Warping Grid {{depicts the}} {{solution}} to the problem. The circular radar coverage area is divided into a circular grid. Only the corner points of the grid are geo warped which drastically reduces the computation time. Coordinates within a grid tile are computed by a weighted bilinear interpolation of the grid corner points.As <b>geographical</b> <b>projections</b> are typically non-linear functions this introduces a certain error for the radar video display position. Keeping this error sufficiently below the radar measurement resolution makes sure that this is no restriction for the radar video display quality. The grid tile size has to be computed once for a radar position and a given projection. Thus, the grid is typically computed once for a static radar and only more often for moving radars e.g. on ships.|$|R

The developers anticipate this tool will provide a better grasp of structures and enable an improved understanding of features from multiple viewpoints. The following needs were identified on the basis of interviews with subjects who are likely users of map software: overhead views and true-to-life views; side-by-side comparison of arbitrarily selected locations; and context awareness. The software was designed to satisfy these requirements by incorporating a new algorithm, resulting in a package with distinctly different characteristics from those that are browsed in a directly geometric fashion. In this paper, we propose a viewing system that allows the user to switch seamlessly between different <b>geographical</b> <b>projections</b> and a multi-focus view displaying method by parameter adjustment and split screen.

As SDMs {{have been widely used}} for biodiversity studies at regional scale, there are increase demands for different environmental data in a standardized format. In order to facilitate the manipulation of these geographical datasets, at this paper we present Ambdata: a website created to provide environmental variables from official data sources useful for SDMs purpose. Environmental variables related to climate (monthly minimum, maximum, and mean temperature; monthly precipitation; and bioclimatic data), topography (altitude, slope, aspect, drainage density, vertical height to the closest drainage), soil and vegetation characteristics, usually used for SDMs, were first acquired, produced and then organized in a geographical information system. Each variable was resampled to spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds (approximately 1 km), converted to Lat-Long <b>geographical</b> <b>projection,</b> and clipped to the geographical boundaries of Brazil and Brazilian Amazon. Once the ascii-raster grid files were prepared, we organized a webpage called Ambdata that describes the dataset and provides free access to these data.

We present a new Moho map for the Antarctica, derived from geophysical data selected from the literature. Themodel covers thewhole Antarctic region, from the South Pole out to the continental margin, including the Antarctic Peninsula. TheMoho depth is represented with a resolution of 1 °× 1 ° on a Cartesian grid obtained by an equidistant azimuthal <b>geographical</b> <b>projection.</b> A large volume of new data has been analyzed: mostly seismic experiments, as well as receiver functions and geological studies. In general,we can identify three large domainswithin the Antarctic continental crust. The oldest Archean and Proterozoic crust of East Antarctica has a thickness of 36 – 56 km (with {{an average of about}} 41 km). The continental crust of the Transantarctic Mountains, the Antarctic Peninsula and Wilkes Basin has a thickness of 30 – 40 km (with an average Moho of about 30 km).

40|$|Quantitative {{estimates}} of the range loss of mountain plants under climate change have so far mostly relied on static <b>geographical</b> <b>projections</b> of species' habitat shifts(1 - 3). Here, we use a hybrid model(4) that combines such projections with simulations of demography and seed dispersal to forecast the climate-driven spatio-temporal dynamics of 150 high-mountain plant species across the European Alps. This model predicts average range size reductions of 44 - 50 % {{by the end of}} the twenty-first century, which is similar to projections from the most 'optimistic' static model (49 %). However, the hybrid model also indicates that population dynamics will lag behind climatic trends and that an average of 40 % of the range still occupied at the end of the twenty-first century will have become climatically unsuitable for the respective species, creating an extinction debt(5, 6). Alarmingly, species endemic to the Alps seem to face the highest range losses. These results caution against optimistic conclusions from moderate range size reductions observed during the twenty-first century as they are likely to belie more severe longer-term effects of climate warming on mountain plants...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} ice ages on {{speciation}} {{have been well}} documented for many European and North American taxa. In contrast, very few studies have addressed the consequences of such environmental and topographical changes in North East Asian species. More precisely, the Korean Peninsula offers a unique model to assess patterns and processes of speciation as it hosts the northern- and eastern-most distribution limit of some widespread Asian taxa. Despite this, studies addressing phylogeographic patterns and population genetics in the peninsula and surrounding countries are few and studies for most families are lacking. Here we inferred the phylogenetic relationships of the common toad (Bufo gargarizans) from South Korea and their North East Asian counterpart populations, based on mitochondrial data. Korean B. gargarizans GenBank BLASTs matched few individuals from nearby China, but {{the presence of a}} Korean clade suggests isolation on the Korean Peninsula, previous to the last glacial maximum, linked to sea level resurgence. Molecular clock calibrations within this group were used to date the divergence between clades and their relationship to paleo-climatic events in the area. Lack of genetic structure among South Korean populations and strong homogeneity between the Korean and some Chinese localities suggest weak isolation and recent expansion. <b>Geographical</b> <b>projection</b> of continuous coalescent maximum-clade-credibility trees shows an original Chinese expansion towards the Korean Peninsula through the Yellow Sea circa two million years ago with colonisation events dating circa 800 thousand years ago (K. y. a.).

40|$|Aim: Our aim was {{to produce}} a dated {{phylogeny}} of Typhlatya, a stygobiont shrimp genus with an extremely disjunct localized distribution across the Mediterranean, the central Atlantic and eastern Pacific. Using phylogenetic analyses, we examine the role of dispersal and plate tectonics in determining its distribution. Location: Western Mediterranean, Ascension Island, Bermuda, Bahamas, Yucatán, Caribbean, Galápagos, Western Australia. Methods: Thirteen of the 17 species of Typhlatya were analysed, using Stygiocaris, Halocaridina and Antecaridina as outgroups. Fragments of three mitochondrial and three nuclear genes were combined into a data set of 2449 mitochondrial and 1374 nuclear base pairs. Results: Phylogenetic trees clearly showed Typhlatya to be paraphyletic, with the Galápagos species clustering with Antecaridina. Only the phylogenetic position of Typhlatya monae (Hispaniola and Puerto Rico) showed some uncertainty, appearing as the sister group to the Australian genus Stygiocaris on the most likely topology. We estimated {{an average age of}} 45  Myr (30. 6 - 61. 1  Myr) for the most recent common ancestor of Typhlatya + Stygiocaris + Antecaridina + Halocaridina. All Typhlatya (except Typhlatya galapagensis) + Stygiocaris derived from a node dated to 35. 7  Ma (25. 7 - 47. 0  Ma), whereas the ancestor of all Typhlatya species (excluding T. monae and T. galapagensis) lived 30. 7  Ma (21. 9 - 40. 4  Ma). Main conclusions: Typhlatya is paraphyletic and apparently absent from the eastern Pacific, with T. galapagensis clustering with Antecaridina. The remaining Typhlatya species form a robust monophyletic group with Stygiocaris, and both molecular and morphological evidence support the recognition of three sublineages: (1) Typhlatya s. str., Atlantic-Mediterranean, embracing all Typhlatya species minus T. monae; (2) Stygiocaris, limited to north-western Australia; and (3) T. monae (Caribbean), for which a new genus could be erected.

40|$|Time {{series of}} {{satellite}} data, {{generated by the}} AVHRR (1981 - 1999), CZCS (1979 - 1985) and SeaWiFS (1998 - 2002), {{have been used to}} assess trends and interactions of physical and bio-geo-chemical features in the Adriatic Sea. The images were processed to estimate Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll-like Pigment Concentration (CPC). Long-term composites and climatologies were derived, using fixed <b>geographical</b> grids and <b>projections.</b> The AVHRR data show an apparent warming trend, when plotting the sequence of seasonal cycles (monthly mean SST, averaged over the whole basin) against time, due to a steady rise of summer values. Considering 3 regions (north, central and south), split into east and west sections, the northern Adriatic shows high SST fluctuations (possibly associated with the cycle of winter cooling and summer warming, typical of the relatively shallow sub-basin), while the southern Adriatic exhibits a lower variability (possibly influenced by the periodic water incoming from, and outflowing to the Ionian Sea). During summer, an east-west gradient prevails, while during winter only a general north-south gradient can be found. The SeaWiFS-derived CPC values, distributions and trends appear to be consistent with the historical CZCS record. Persistent differences in the quantitative assessment of CPC for coastal waters is due to the use of improved algorithms, less influenced by the presence of dissolved organics and suspended sediments in the water column, for the processing of SeaWiFS data. Apparent incongruities of the space and time patterns in the SeaWiFS record with respect to the reference climatology, obtained by CZCS more than a decade before, occur chiefly when considering the spring bloom in the southern Adriatic and the summer development of the north Adriatic front. The comparison of the long-term times series of satellite data shows that there is a high correlation between patterns in the thermal field and in the colour field. This suggests that different surface waters, identified by the SST index, are also traced by different ecological features, identified by the CPC index. Both indices also show a high correlation with the classical cyclonic circulation scheme of the Adriatic Sea, proposing once again an intimate relationship between the water dynamics and its bio-geo-chemistry.
