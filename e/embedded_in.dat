40|$|We {{show that}} an n-dimensional compactum X <b>embeds</b> <b>in</b> R^m, where m> 3 (n+ 1) / 2, if {{and only if}} X x X - Δ admits an equivariant map to S^m- 1. <b>In</b> particular, X <b>embeds</b> <b>in</b> R^ 2 n, n> 3, iff the top power of the (twisted) Euler class of the factor-exchanging {{involution}} on X x X - Δ is trivial. Assuming that X quasi-embeds in R^ 2 n (i. e. is an inverse limit of n-polyhedra, embeddable in R^ 2 n), this is equivalent to the vanishing of an obstruction in lim^ 1 H^ 2 n- 1 (K_i) over compact subsets K_i⊂ X x X - Δ. One application is that an n-dimensional ANR <b>embeds</b> <b>in</b> R^ 2 n if it quasi-embeds in R^ 2 n- 1, n> 3. We construct an ANR of dimension n> 1, quasi-embeddable but not embeddable in R^ 2 n, and an AR of dimension n> 1, which does not "movably" <b>embed</b> <b>in</b> R^ 2 n. These examples come close to, but don't quite resolve, Borsuk's problem: does every n-dimensional AR <b>embed</b> <b>in</b> R^ 2 n? In the affirmative direction, we show that an n-dimensional compactum X <b>embeds</b> <b>in</b> R^ 2 n, n> 3, if H^n(X) = 0 and H^n+ 1 (X,X-pt) = 0 for every pt∈ X. There are applications in the entire metastable range as well. An n-dimensional compactum X with H^n-i(X-pt) = 0 for each pt∈ X and all i< k <b>embeds</b> <b>in</b> R^ 2 n-k. This generalizes Bryant and Mio's result that k-connected n-dimensional generalized manifolds <b>embed</b> <b>in</b> R^ 2 n-k.
