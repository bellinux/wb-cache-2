5|$|Moore {{wrote to}} Spargo on September 18, stating that his {{commission}} had approved {{the head of}} Allen but was dissatisfied with the lettering. Spargo had mentioned that President Coolidge liked the Bennington Monument, and Moore stated that the Fine Arts Commission was anxious to <b>get</b> <b>right</b> a coin for the president's state of birth; Fry, he wrote, had the talent to design a handsome coin, but had not done so. The next day, Spargo replied, hopeful that they would soon resolve the dispute. He stated that the Sesquicentennial Commission felt that designs other than the monument would not do; for example, {{the use of a}} Green Mountain Boy would both require stretching history and risk charges of imitating the Minuteman seen on the Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollar, issued earlier in 1925. He was also unwilling to have a two-headed coin, as such a design combined with the depiction of Allen would be. Spargo suggested that Moore put his objections in writing and be as clear as possible to induce Fry to continue with the project, because the sculptor wanted to withdraw from it. Despite conciliatory efforts, Fry refused to continue, and after the failure of brief negotiations with Theodore Spicer-Simson, the Vermont commission engaged Charles Keck.|$|E

Stone argued the season premiere should focus on the economy because it was the biggest news item at the time, but Parker felt they needed more time to craft the script, and that the Jonas Brothers would be a funny season opener.

Kapoor faced difficulty with his heavy costumes, and suffered blisters on his feet after walking barefoot in the desert for a sequence.

A steam effect in the sequence proved difficult due to the special effects operator having to time it with Bennet's shooting, working around a delay in the air canister system of several seconds. Tancharoen used a handheld camera, with the operator having to [...] "run all over the place with this really heavy camera on his shoulder", but wanted to move away from the Jason Bourne, shaky-cam style of filming, saying that because of his background in choreography, [...] "It’s drilled in my head that the camera has to complement the movement of the action."
