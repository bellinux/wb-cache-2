He worked as a draftsman for the architectural firm of Emery Roth and Sons, the city's largest architectural firm and a noted designer of office buildings, for a year. In 1953, Koubek entered the United States Army, where {{he worked for the}} Army Exhibit Unit (a unit which creates displays and presentations about Army history, organization, and culture for the public). Koubek and his wife became naturalized United States citizens, relocated to Washington, DC, and later had a daughter, Jana. He briefly worked for the D.C.-based Edward Weihe architectural firm.|$|E

Even after checking with metal detectors for guns and bombs, the police do {{not allow them to}} go unless they pay.

25|$|An {{extension}} of Novardok's unconventional approach entailed {{the establishment of}} numerous branches of the yeshiva. The most elite students of the yeshiva would set out on foot to strange communities without money <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>pockets,</b> simultaneously abstaining from speech and not asking for a ride or even food. Upon reaching a town, they would enter the Beth Midrash, and without a word to anyone, study Torah.|$|E

25|$|Adding {{secondary}} {{actions to}} the main action gives a scene more life, and can help to support the main action. A person walking can simultaneously swing their arms or keep them <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>pockets,</b> speak or whistle, or express emotions through facial expressions. The important thing about secondary actions is that they emphasize, rather than take {{attention away from the}} main action. If the latter is the case, those actions are better left out. For example, during a dramatic movement, facial expressions will often go unnoticed. In these cases it is better to include them at {{the beginning and the end}} of the movement, rather than during.|$|E
25|$|One {{afternoon}} in June, Bucey was returning from Tête Jaune Cache {{and had just}} passed the Grand Canyon when he spotted a white flag on the river bank. This {{was a sign that}} someone needed the sternwheeler to stop, either to take on cargo or passengers. The passengers turned out to be twenty burly railworkers with their paychecks <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>pockets,</b> all of whom {{were on their way to}} Fort George. In particular, South Fort George, where there was a licensed hotel, and a variety of other entertainments, where one could celebrate the end of another work week. However, when the purser approached the first of these men for his fare, the man obstinately refused to pay, even after the purser offered to cash his company paycheck. Fearing that if he let one get away without paying that none would pay, the purser went up to the pilot house and spoke to Captain Bucey.|$|E

They were strolling at about the pace one would expect of them if they were patrolling a quiet park. They {{did not seem to}} be at all excited or concerned about the circumstances.I could hardly believe my eyes. Here were New York City policemen, entering a room from which at least a dozen shots had been heard, and yet not one of them had his gun out! As a matter of absolute fact, some of them even had their hands <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>pockets.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Mars was a {{struggling}} singer-songwriter, and Levine was a producer looking {{to work with}} new songwriters. Lawrence was the first guest at Levine's studio (Levcon Studios); they had previously worked together after being introduced by a mutual friend. One day Mars and Lawrence {{were sitting in the}} car with no money <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>pockets</b> when they decided to try producing for themselves and enlisted the help of Levine who contributed his equipment and expertise in drum programming, sampling and other electronic sounds that dominate. In 2009, The Smeezingtons settled in Hollywood. After creating the team, [...] they worked over 10 hours every day for two years.|$|E
500|$|The film is {{primarily}} presented {{from the perspective}} of the character Dax and his camera, but Nourizadeh also obtained footage by providing the cast and extras with recording devices such as BlackBerrys and iPhones to capture events occurring outside of the perspective or knowledge of the cameraman. This resulted in hours of unusable footage that had to be observed by Nourizadeh and his team to find segments that could be incorporated into the final film. Nourizadeh stated [...] "when you have real material being shot by real people, it then kind of feels like it is. It is found footage. I hated spending 10 hours looking through bits of flip footage – people didn’t press stop, it's like <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>pockets.</b> But yeah, it was great, man." [...] Other footage was provided from fictional police and news cameras to give a different perspective on the events.|$|E
500|$|In Western movies, the characters' gun belts {{are often}} worn {{low on the}} hip and outer thigh, with the holster cut away around the pistol's trigger and grip for a smooth, fast draw. This type of holster is a Hollywood anachronism. Fast-draw artists can be {{distinguished}} from other movie cowboys because their guns will often be tied to their thigh. Long before holsters were steel-lined, they were soft and supple for comfortable all-day wear. A gunfighter would use tie-downs to keep his pistol from catching on the holster while drawing. Most of the time, gunfighters would just hide their pistols <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>pockets</b> and waistbands. Wild Bill Hickok popularized the butt-forward holster type, which worked better on horseback. Other gunfighters would use bridgeport rigs that gave a faster and easier draw. Revolvers were a popular weapon to gunfighters who were horsemen, cowboys, and lawmen because of their concealability and effectiveness on horseback. The Winchester rifle was also a popular weapon among gunfighters. Dubbed the [...] "Gun that Won the West", it was widely used during the settlement of the American frontier. Shotguns were also a popular weapon for [...] "express messengers" [...] and guards, especially those on stagecoaches and trains who {{were in charge of}} overseeing and guarding a valuable private shipment.|$|E

Pilot Roger Q. Williams, held up the flight for three weeks with legal disputes with Levine over back pay. On October 9, 1930, Maple Leaf performed the first transatlantic flight by a Canadian between Canada and London, England in 36 hours, 10 minutes. The aircraft was piloted by Erroll Boyd, and Harry P.

2500|$|They {{were charged}} with making an {{extremely}} difficult trek inland over the Kapa Kapa Trail toward Jaure, where they were to flank the Japanese on the Kokoda Trail. The total distance over {{the mountains to the}} Japanese positions was over , and most of the trail was barely a goat path. The men carried only six days rations, expecting to be resupplied en route. The food however was very poor, including hardtack, rice and bully beef, some of which had become rancid and sickening many men. They had leather toilet seats but no machetes, insect repellent, waterproof containers for medicine or personal effects, and it rained heavily every day. When they received quinine pills, water chlorination tablets, vitamin pills, or salt tablets, usually a few days supply, they began to disintegrate almost as soon as the men put them <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>pockets</b> or packs.|$|E
2500|$|Last {{among the}} ministers were the Grand Treasurers. They kept {{accounts}} of the state finances, cash flow and State Treasury, and controlled the minting of coin. Since, like the Chancellors, they received no wages, corruption ran rampant and a sizable portion of state finances was lost <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>pockets.</b> If a Treasurer moved to another post, he was obliged to render accounts of his disbursements, and if he died, his family were required to produce them. A telling story is that of Bogusław Leszczyński, who while a Grand Treasurer (1650–1658) was offered a Chancellor's post, which he accepted in 1658. He bribed {{the members of the}} Parliament to grant him [...] "absolution", and when one of them later opposed him, he asked, curious: [...] "Who's this son of a bitch that I failed to pay off?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Buffalo Bill treated Native American {{employees}} as equals with white cowboys.

[...] Wild Westers were employed as performers, interpreters and recruiters. [...] Men had money <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>pockets</b> and for their families on the reservation. Female performers were paid extra for infants and children and supplemented wages by making and selling Lakota crafts. Shows hired venerable elder male Indians to appear in the parades to ensure that young men acted with consideration and politeness when visiting host communities, and rules were self-policed by traditional Oglala Lakota chiefs and former U.S. Army Indian Scouts. Known as “Show Indians”, Oglala Wild Westers referred to themselves as [...] "Oskate Wicasa" [...] or [...] "Show Man", a title of great honor and respect. Since 1887, Wild Westing has been family tradition with several hundred Pine Ridge families, and the tradition of the Wild Wester community is not unlike the tradition of circus families and communities. [...] American Horse’s sons Ben American Horse and Samuel American Horse were Carlisle Wild Westers and interpreters.|$|E
