5|$|At the 2008 Olympic Trials, {{he ran a}} wind {{assisted}} 9.68 {{seconds in}} the 100m. Days after he suffered a severe hamstring injury in the 200m trials and did not win any medals at the Beijing Olympics. His performance of 9.71 seconds to win the 100m silver medal in the 2009 World Championships is the fastest non-winning time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>event.</b>|$|E
5|$|Attendance {{figures were}} speculated {{to be around}} 70,000 {{leading up to the}} race, which was {{accurate}} as the official attendance <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> was reported to be 69,138. This became the second-most attended Belmont Stakes at the time, after the 1971 race which had 82,694 in attendance. The track conditions were clear and fast.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{earthquake}} occurred before seismometers were {{operating in the}} region, {{the magnitude of the}} shock and its location were never precisely determined, but the intensity reports that are available <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> were studied, and various epicenters <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> were proposed based on these limited data. One study presented an estimated moment magnitude of 6.5–7.0, with a proposed location {{on the east side of}} the Cascade Range near Lake Chelan. The results of a separate study indicated that it may have been a larger event, placing the shock in the North Cascades, just south of the Canada–United States border at Ross Lake.|$|E

30|$|To get a rough idea on the {{strength}} of high-frequency radiation, we estimated the approximate values of <b>the</b> corner frequencies <b>for</b> <b>the</b> two <b>events</b> using <b>the</b> S-wave recordings at two selected F-net stations located at rock sites. An additional file is provided that deals with the estimation of <b>the</b> corner frequencies <b>for</b> <b>the</b> two <b>events</b> (see Additional file 1). We found that <b>the</b> corner frequencies <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2004 <b>event</b> are higher than or similar to those <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2016 <b>event.</b> Given <b>the</b> similar corner frequencies <b>for</b> <b>the</b> two <b>events,</b> <b>the</b> stress drop <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2004 <b>event</b> is expected to be much larger because the seismic moment of <b>the</b> 2004 <b>event</b> is larger by a factor of about 12 than that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2016 <b>event</b> (Brune 1970, 1971). Stress drop may be considered as one of the parameters that control {{the strength}} of high-frequency radiation (Boore 1983). In fact, as mentioned above, the observed PGAs were clearly underestimated by <b>the</b> GMPEs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2004 <b>event,</b> while <b>the</b> prediction was reasonable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2016 <b>event.</b> Together, these observations may indicate that <b>the</b> 2004 <b>event</b> was a higher stress drop event.|$|R

5|$|Funding <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>event,</b> {{which cost}} {{approximately}} $30,000, was crowdsourced. Obtaining {{a permit to}} host the event at the park cost $3,000. Monetary donations were accepted, and merchandise sales also funded the demonstrations. Funds were transferred through the Xerces Society. Portland Science Advocates was established as a nonprofit organization, and members hoped to continue the demonstration's mission after the march.|$|E
