One solution to the problem is to add a <b>fading</b> <b>margin</b> on the transmitter, but it is not an effective solution. The other solution is to use an alternative statistical behavior of fading channels (applying the basic concepts of diversity), which use two or more inputs on the receiver to ensure the correlation of signal. So, the diversity technique is used to improve system performance in fading channels. Instead of transmitting and receiving the desired signal through one channel, we have L copies of desired signal transferred over M different channels.

The equipment under test uses 2  ×  2 multi-input multi-output (MIMO), there are two spatial streams where both horizontal and vertically polarized signals are utilized. Fading is generally uncorrelated for horizontal and vertically polarized signals and the probability that both signals will <b>fade</b> below their <b>margin</b> is the product each individual fade probability.
