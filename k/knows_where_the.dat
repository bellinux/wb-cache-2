25|$|At the Great Library, Ebling Mis works {{continuously}} {{until his}} health fatally deteriorates. As Mis lies dying, he tells Toran, Bayta, and Magnifico that he <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Second Foundation is. But {{just before he}} can reveal the Second Foundation's location, however, Bayta kills him. Bayta had realized, shortly before, that Magnifico was actually the Mule, who had used his powers in every planet they had previously visited. In the same way, he had forced Mis to continue working and find what the Mule was looking for. Bayta had killed Mis {{to prevent him from}} revealing the Second Foundation's whereabouts to the Mule.|$|E
25|$|Olkar {{wants to}} seize the diadem of Vishnu, the great {{treasure}} of Benares, but Démaly refuses to say where it is hidden. Olkar places Laméa in Démaly's prison cell, hoping she will lure him into revealing the location. Instead, she tells Démaly that an army of rescuers {{is on its way}} from Ellabad. The bayaderes also have a plan to trick the Mahrattas. She tells Olkar she <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> diadem is but will only bring it to him after a victory celebration in Benares. The festivities take place and the bayaderes lull the Mahrattas with their dancing and intoxicating drinks and secretly take away their weapons. Laméa now gives the signal for the rescuing army to attack. Led by Démaly, who has been freed from prison, they defeat the Mahrattas.|$|E
25|$|At this point, with Mattacks {{busy with}} other projects, the band shifted to an {{acoustic}} format for touring and released the unplugged Old, New, Borrow Blue as ‘Fairport Acoustic Convention’ in 1996. For {{a while the}} four-piece acoustic line-up ran in parallel with the electric format. When Allcock left the band, he was replaced by Chris Leslie on vocals, mandolin and fiddle, who formerly worked with Swarbrick in Whippersnapper, and had a one-off stint with the band replacing Ric Sanders for 1992 Cropredy Festival. This meant {{that for the first}} time since reforming, the band had a recognized songwriter who contributed significantly to the band's output on the next album Who <b>Knows</b> <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> Time Goes (1997), particularly the rousing ‘John Gaudie’. By the time of the 1997 thirty-year anniversary Festival at Cropredy, the new Fairport had been in existence for over a decade and contributed a significant chapter to the history of the band.|$|E

Amir's father, a wealthy merchant Amir affectionately refers to as Baba, loves both boys, but is often critical of Amir, considering him weak and lacking in courage. Amir finds a kinder fatherly figure in Rahim Khan, Baba's closest friend, who understands him and supports his interest in writing, whereas Baba considers that interest to be worthy only of females.|$|E

500|$|The band's male vocalist Iain Matthews left {{during the}} {{recordings}} for Unhalfbricking {{to make his}} own album Matthews' Southern Comfort, after recording just one track, [...] "Percy's Song". Sandy Denny sang lead vocals on all the other songs, including her own compositions, [...] "Autopsy", and [...] "Who <b>Knows</b> <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> Time Goes?". The latter was covered by many artists and is now viewed to be a classic. The lengthy [...] "A Sailor's Life", a traditional English folk song collected by A. L.

Emma investigates a robbery of Mr. Gold's home, who says he knows that Moe is responsible, seeking revenge for the repossession. Emma recovers the majority of Mr. Gold's items {{but one thing is}} missing and he will stop at nothing until it is recovered. He kidnaps Moe, ties him up and beats him, demanding where it is. However, he soon starts saying [...] "she's gone," [...] referring to Belle, until Emma arrives to stop him. Mr. Gold believes Regina (Parrilla) put Moe up to the theft and she <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> last stolen item is. Emma still has to arrest Mr. Gold for kidnapping and assault.|$|E
500|$|Unorthodox Jukebox was {{met with}} {{generally}} favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 70, based on 16 reviews. Melissa Maerz from Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A– and stated that [...] " [...] talent for crafting little pop perfections of all stripes is undeniable", describing the record as a fusion of pop and R Rolling Stone magazine's Jody Rosen awarded Unorthodox Jukebox {{four out of five}} stars, writing that, [...] "The result is a record that makes the competition sound sad and idea-starved by comparison". Dan Hyman from Spin granted the record an 8/10 rating, pointing out that [...] "the bulk of Unorthodox Jukebox benefits from presenting [...] as he truly imagines himself: a big belter with an ear for pop hooks, sure, but one unafraid to dive into murkier waters." [...] Hyman went on feeling that Mars' lyrics [...] "get a desperately needed kick in the pants". Matt Cibula of PopMatters complimented the songs' hooks and found the album [...] "sung and arranged just as perfectly as his earlier work [...] a truly accomplished and slick pop album". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times labelled the songwriting exceptional, while praising Mars for being [...] "a model of concision who always <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> trigger is, and always, always pulls it". He went on complimenting the songs on the record, [...] "these {{are some of the most}} energy-infused but profoundly cosseted songs you’re likely to hear all year".|$|E

2500|$|Although Denny had {{a devoted}} {{following}} in her lifetime, {{she did not}} achieve mass market success. In the years since her death, her reputation has grown. A four-album box set entitled Who <b>Knows</b> <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> Time Goes? (1985) was produced by her widower Trevor Lucas and Joe Boyd and included many rare and previously unreleased tracks. This was the first public indication that a large cache of unreleased material existed.
