40|$|Denitrification bioreactors for nitrate removal in {{agricultural}} drainage have recently gained attention for their low cost and effectiveness. While research continues {{to investigate the}} optimal sizing of these systems, little {{work has been done}} on the optimal design geometry (Length to width ratio and cross sectional shape). To address this lack, pilot-scale (1 / 10 th scale) work performed in Iowa during the summer of 2009 explored three shapes of potential bioreactor designs. The objective was to study the nitrate removal effectiveness of each design at various retention times. The pilot bioreactors had a standard volume (0. 71 m 3) and depth (0. 61 m) and different dimensions of 0. 76 m x 1. 5 m (rectangle), 0. 38 m x 3. 0 m (channel), and 1. 5 m x 1. 2 m (trapezoidal). Steady state experiments consisted of the bioreactors being allowed to run at a given retention time for several days/weeks before being changed to a different retention time. A hydrograph flush experiment simulated a <b>drainage</b> <b>hydrograph</b> moving through the bioreactor {{over the course of a}} few days. Preliminary results indicated little significant difference between the designs though the channel design seems to provide the most consistent results between the two experiments. Further analysis of this data is expected to guide future full-scale denitrification bioreactor designs...|$|E

Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses from croplands contribute to impairment of water bodies. This {{study was conducted}} to test candidate denitrifying bioreactor media for nitrate-N and dissolved reactive P (DRP) removal from agricultural effluent in drainage ditches. The nitrate-N and DRP removal performance of carbon materials widely available in the Midwest, wood chips (WC) and corn cobs (CC), were compared to treatments of mixed materials: wood chips and hardwood biochar (WC+BC), wood chips and sodium acetate (WC+A), corn cobs and modified coconut coir (CC+MC), and corn cobs, modified coconut coir, and modified macadamia biochar (CC+MC+MBC). Water with a nitrate-N concentration of 20 mg N L- 1 and a DRP concentration of 0. 3 mg P L- 1 was pumped through PVC columns packed with treatment media. The flow rate was adjusted to match the rise and decay of a typical <b>drainage</b> <b>hydrograph.</b> Effluent was sampled after hydraulic residence times (HRT) of 1. 5, 8, 12, and 24 h. The laboratory experiment was conducted at 15 °C for 14 weeks, 5 °C for 13 weeks, and 15 °C again for 7 weeks in a temperature controlled chamber, designated the warm run, cold run and rewarm run, respectively. Nitrate-N load reductions ranged from 24 % to 96 % in the warm and rewarm runs and from 4 % to 80 % in the cold run. Nitrate-N load reduction performance at all temperatures was in the order of: WC+A > CC+MC > CC > CC+MC+MBC > WC > WC+BC. The nitrate removal rate (NRR) was highest at the 1. 5 h HRT for the WC+A treatment at all temperatures. Cumulative DRP load reductions in the warm and rewarm runs were statistically higher in the CC, CC+MC, and CC+MC+MBC treatments, with DRP load reductions of 74 %, 81 %, and 67 %, respectively. The WC+A treatment had the highest DRP load reduction in the cold run, with a 45 % reduction. The CC, CC+MC, and CC+MC+MBC treatments had both high NRR and high DRP percent concentration removal in the warm and rewarm runs, but the WC+A treatment had higher removal of both nutrients in the cold run and specifically at lower HRTs. For both nitrate-N and DRP load reductions during high flows and cold temperatures, WC+A would be the recommended treatment. Future work should focus on the addition of carbon such as sodium acetate to enhance bioreactor performance during high drainage and cold temperature conditions...|$|E
40|$|Experiments to {{characterize}} runoff and drainage from large undisturbed soil cores {{obtained from a}} site under volunteer pasture are presented. The objectives were to evaluate if a simple kinematic wave model could be used {{to characterize}} drainage under conditions of by-passing flow and to investigate the variability of runoff generation under wet and dry antecedent conditions in this well structured soil. Cores were taken to depths of 0. 4 and 0. 7 m, with six cores obtained from each depth. Results show that variations in soil structure between cores have a greater influence on the hydrologic response than variations in antecedent water content. It may be inferred that, in this soil, good structural continuity substantially enhances soil drainage and, in consequence, decreases surface runoff. During wetting, kinematic celerities ranged from 337 to 3200 mm h- 1 in the short cores and from 357 to 1400 mm h- 1 in the long cores. The corresponding estimated ranges of mobile or 'macropore' fractions were from 0. 015 to 0. 154 m 3 m- 3 in the short cores and 0. 033 to 0. 132 m 3 m- 3 in the long cores. Both parameters were approximately log-normally distributed. Measured <b>drainage</b> <b>hydrographs</b> were reasonably well described by the kinematic model but the physical significance of the model parameters was unclear...|$|R
40|$|Preferential flow in soil is {{of major}} {{importance}} for the dynamic of groundwater recharge, on a quantitative and qualitative point of view. This is particularly the case in Mediterranean regions where this phenomenon is increased due to flood irrigation, high intensity rainfall events and seasonal soil water deficit leading to soil shrinkage and cracking. A large scale experimental setup devoted to a multiscale study of preferential flow in soil and of groundwater recharge processes {{has been set up}} in Avignon, South of France in 2002. It is composed of a large scale undisturbed lysimeter associated to a 0. 7 ha field. Agricultural practices are the same on both plots. The field plot is equipped with piezometers, groundwater level probes working at a fine time step, water balance sites and porous cups for soil water sampling. The lysimeter is equiped with soil moisture probes and tensiometers, and with an automatic device for measuring drainage flow {{at the bottom of the}} lysimeter. Physical and hydrodynamic properties of the field plot and lysimeter have been measured using geophysical devices (electrical tomography and electromagnetic prospection) and the kinematic wave theory for preferential flow. Local hydrodynamic properties of the aquifer are also known. We present some results concerning (i) rainfall simulation on the lysimeter and on the field using chemical tracers and water stable isotopes, (ii) <b>drainage</b> <b>hydrographs</b> obtained at the bottom of the lysimeter under natural rains, (iii) groundwater level variations. This is an original experimental device, combining tracers experiments, geophysical and physical monitoring of soil water and groundwater dynamics, for studying in situ bypass flow in soil and rapid groundwater recharge at the field scale...|$|R

Irrigations were centered above a drain conduit installed 1. 1 m below the soil surface.

40|$|Artificial {{subsurface}} agricultural drainage helps increase {{agricultural productivity}} by improving the timeliness of field operations and the workability {{of the soil}} in many locations around the world. However, the detrimental water quality impacts precipitated by such drainage systems are a concern {{in many of these}} locations. For example, in the US Midwest region, artificial agricultural drainage has been done for over 100 years, but over the past several decades, nitrogen loadings from drainage in this area have been causally implicated in one of the United States 2 ̆ 7 largest water quality concerns: the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, local water quality impairment stemming from agricultural drainage is beginning to be targeted by regulatory agencies around the world. Denitrification bioreactors for agricultural drainage are one of the newest technologies being investigated for practical edge-of-field nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 -N) reduction. Promising early results from these systems have led to increased attention {{over the past few years}} from many groups including governmental agencies, researchers, and agricultural organizations. The overall goal of this dissertation was to investigate the design, performance, and cost-efficiency of denitrification bioreactors for agricultural drainage. This Ph. D. work is the culmination of 3. 5 yr of work both in Iowa, USA and in Palmerston North, New Zealand. In short, pilot-scale investigations of bioreactor performance (Chapters 2 and 3) influenced the design and field-scale evaluation of several bioreactors in Iowa (Chapter 4), and as interest in denitrification bioreactors grew over this Ph. D. period, a comprehensive cost comparison of bioreactors and other water quality improvement options became necessary (Chapter 5). Major conclusions related to the importance of retention time and water temperature in bioreactor nitrate removal performance. Additionally, the hydraulics of water moving through a denitrification bioreactor was shown to be important as increased flow rates during <b>drainage</b> <b>hydrographs</b> caused decreased retention times and reduced nitrate removal. In terms of cost, this 2 ̆ 2 apples to apples 2 ̆ 2 comparison showed that bioreactors were comparable to other water quality practices at 1. 44 /kg N removed. While this dissertation concluded denitrification bioreactors were a viable option for reducing the amount of nitrate in agricultural drainage, more research on their design and performance is needed...|$|R
40|$|Groundwater is an {{important}} resource for irrigation agriculture. To monitor the irrigation extractions various NSW state government departments installed monitoring boreholes and the measurements {{are available on the}} ‘Historic data CD “PINNEENA”for groundwater works’ ([URL] hydrograph data from this CD were analysed to provide insights into the 3 D geometry and connectivity of the aquifers throughout the Namoi Catchment. This could be done for all catchments throughout the Murray-Darling Basin. Borehole hydrograph analysis provides an independent methodology to map recharge zones, access aquifer connectivity, and delineate areas of groundwater mining or recovery. The impact of historical groundwater extractions and current water sharing plans can then be analysed {{in the context of the}} mapped aquifer connectivity. The major goals of the 3 D hydrograph analysis are to: •map hydraulic connectivity throughout the alluvial sequence,•develop a 3 D conceptual site model,•examine the long-term impact of irrigation extractions,•compare zones of declining groundwater head to the connectivity interpretation, and•examine the changes in groundwater head since the introduction of the water sharing plan. This 3 D borehole hydrograph spatial and temporal analysis shows that the largest zones of decline in the Namoi Catchment correspond to semi-confined aquifers with low connectivity to the unconfined aquifer and thus recharge from streams, floods, diffuse rainfall or irrigation deep <b>drainage.</b> 3 D <b>hydrograph</b> analysis of pumping induced groundwater head fluctuation maps unconfined and semi-confined aquifers. It also delineates palaeochannels. An implication of the 3 D aquifer connectivity analysis is that managed aquifer recharge will be required to replenish some portions of the Namoi Catchment. 3 D borehole hydrograph analysis is another tool to enhance the conceptualisation of aquifers. It complements other methods including gridding lithologicallogs, palynologystudies, water chemistry investigations and geophysical surveys. These conceptual site models will guide the future construction of water balance models and provide {{an important}} visual representation of the catchment for communicating changes to a non-scientific audience...|$|R
40|$|In 2008 {{flooding}} {{occurred over}} {{a majority of}} Iowa, damaging homes, displacing residents, and taking lives. In the wake of this event, the Iowa Flood Center (IFC) was charged with the investigation of distributed flood mitigation strategies to reduce the frequency and magnitude of peak flows in Iowa. This dissertation {{is part of the}} several studies developed by the IFC and focused on the application of a coupled physics based modeling platform, to quantify the coupled benefits of distributed flood mitigation strategies on the reduction of peak flows in an agricultural watershed. Additional investigation into tile drainage and terraces, illustrated the hydrologic impact of each commonly applied agricultural practice. The effect of each practice was represented in numerical simulations through a parameter adjustment. Systems were analyzed at the field scale, to estimate representative parameters, and applied at the watershed scale. The impact of distributed flood mitigation wetlands reduced peak flows by 4 % to 17 % at the outlet of a 45 km 2 watershed. Variability in reduction was a product of antecedent soil moisture, 24 -hour design storm total depth, and initial structural storage capacity. The highest peak flow reductions occurred in scenarios with dry soil, empty project storage, and low rainfall depths. Peak flow reductions were estimated to dissipate beyond a total drainage area of 200 km 2, approximately 2 km downstream of the small watershed outlet. A numerical tracer analysis identified the contribution of tile drainage to stream flow (QT/Q) which varied between 6 % and 71 % through an annual cycle. QT/Q responded directly to meteorological forcing. Precipitation driven events produced a strong positive logarithmic correlation between QT/Q and drainage area. The addition of precipitation into the system saturated near surface soils, increased lateral soil water movement, and reduced the contribution of instream tile flow. A negative logarithmic trend in QT/Q to drainage area persisted in non-event durations. Simulated gradient terraces reduced and delayed peak flows in subcatchments of less than 3 km 2 of <b>drainage</b> area. The <b>hydrographs</b> were shifted responding to rainfall later than non-terraced scenarios, while retaining the total volumetric outflow over longer time periods. The effects of dense terrace systems quickly dissipated, and found to be inconsequential at a drainage area of 45 km 2. Beyond the analysis of individual agricultural features, this work assembled a framework to analyze the feature at the field scale for implementation at the watershed scale. It showed large scale simulations reproduce field scale results well. The product of this work was, a systematic hydrologic characterization of distributed flood mitigation structures, pattern tile drainage, and terrace systems facilitating the simulation of each practices in a physically-based coupled surface-subsurface model...|$|R
