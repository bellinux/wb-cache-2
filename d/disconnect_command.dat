50|$|Unnumbered {{frames are}} {{identified}} by the low two bits being 1. With the P/F flag, that leaves 5 bits as a frame type. Even though fewer than 32 values are in use, some types have different meanings depending on the direction they are sent: as a request or as a response. The relationship between the DISC (<b>disconnect)</b> <b>command</b> and the RD (request disconnect) response seems clear enough, but the reason for making SARM command numerically equal to the DM response is obscure.|$|E
5000|$|... to be {{simultaneously}} {{active in}} the facility as opposed to only one with a Selector channel. The actual number of subchannels provided depends upon the system model and its configuration. [...] Sometimes described as <b>disconnected</b> <b>command</b> chaining, the control unit could disconnect at various times during a chained set of CCWs, for example, disconnection for a Seek CCW, freeing the channel for another subchannel.|$|R
50|$|Manual {{disconnection}} {{could be}} automated {{through the use}} of signals sent though the grid, or on secondary means. For instance, power line carrier communications could be installed in all inverters, periodically checking for signals from the utility and <b>disconnecting</b> either on <b>command,</b> or if the signal disappears for a fixed time. Such a system would be highly reliable, but expensive to implement.|$|R
5000|$|After {{receiving}} Lincoln's telegram, Burnside {{headed to}} the White House himself to investigate. The president told him that two generals who would remain anonymous {{had told him about}} his plans and the army's deteriorating condition. Burnside angrily protested that these officers, whoever they were, deserved to be court-martialed. General-in-Chief Henry Halleck (who was in the room just then) agreed. More importantly, Lincoln argued that {{there seemed to be a}} considerable <b>disconnect</b> between the <b>commanding</b> general and his subordinates. Burnside then requested a private discussion with the president, where he proceeded to denounce Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and General Halleck, arguing that [...] "it would be for the good of the nation if both were replaced". He also added that none of his senior officers supported his plan for a midwinter offensive. Finally, the general said that the way things were going, he might as well resign both command of the Army of the Potomac and his commission and leave the military entirely.|$|R
