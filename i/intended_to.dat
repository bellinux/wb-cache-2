40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the effect of {{settlement}} intentions on the structural, social, and cultural integration of recently arrived intra-EU migrants in the Netherlands. Hypotheses on differences in integration, both shortly after arrival and over time, are derived from the intergenerational immigrant integration model. Based on two waves from the New Immigrants to the Netherlands Survey, a multilevel growth model was estimated. Most differences were found with regard to the level of integration shortly after arrival. Migrants who <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> leave and those who <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> stay were found to differ most strongly from each other in terms of initial levels of structural, social, and cultural integration. Migrants who <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> stay had more contact with natives, were more proficient in Dutch, and consumed more host country media than migrants who <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> leave. On the other hand, migrants who <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> leave worked more hours per week than migrants who <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> stay. Differences over time were only found with regard to Dutch language proficiency. Migrants who <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> stay increased their proficiency stronger than migrant who <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> leave...|$|R
