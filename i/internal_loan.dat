60|$|So far as I can discover, Chinese Constitutionalists {{are doing}} {{the best thing that}} is {{possible}} at the moment, namely, concerting a joint programme, involving the convoking of a Parliament and the cessation of military usurpation. Union is essential, even if it involves sacrifice of cherished beliefs on the part of some. Given a programme upon which all the Constitutionalists are united, they will acquire great weight in public opinion, which is very powerful in China. They may then be able, sooner or later, to offer a high constitutional position to some powerful general, on condition of his ceasing to depend upon mere military force. By this means {{they may be able to}} turn the scales in favour of the man they select, as the student agitation turned the scales in July 1920 in favour of Wu-Pei-Fu against the An Fu party. Such a policy can only be successful if it is combined with vigorous propaganda, both among the civilian population and among the soldiers, and if, as soon as peace is restored, work is found for disbanded soldiers and pay for those who are not disbanded. This raises the financial problem, which is very difficult, because foreign Powers will not lend except in return for some further sacrifice of the remnants of Chinese independence. (For reasons explained in Chap. X., I do not accept the statement by the American consortium bankers that a loan from them would not involve control over China's internal affairs. They may not mean control to be involved, but I am convinced that in fact it would be.) The only way out of this difficulty that I can see is to raise an <b>internal</b> <b>loan</b> by appealing to the patriotism of Chinese merchants. There is plenty of money in China, but, very naturally, rich Chinese will not lend to any of the brigands who now control the Government.|$|E

The evidence suggests that credit lines provided only contingent and partial insurance during the crisis since bank conditions appeared to influence credit line utilization in the short term. It provides a new explanation as to why credit lines are not perfect substitutes for cash holdings for some (e. g. small) firms. Finally, loan level analyses show that more distressed banks charged higher credit spreads on newly negotiated loans but not on funds disbursed from precommitted, formal credit lines.

The study adopted experimental research design where questionnaires were administered to a sample size of eighty (80) respondents. The data obtained were presented in tables and analyzed using simple percentages. The formulated hypotheses were tested using the Pearson product moment correlation and chi-square statistical tool. The results of the study revealed that there is a positive relationship between liquidity risk and credit risk. This is based on the fact that an increase in credit risk (bad loan), the loan (asset) portfolio of such a bank is negatively affected causing an increase in bank illiquidity.

40|$|Along {{with the}} new {{transfer}} pricing documentation requirements, large corporations in Finland have had {{to pay more attention}} to terms of internal loans. In practice, the Finnish Tax Administration requires that the borrower has to be rated. Due to this requirement, many companies purchase a license to rating softwares provided by credit rating agencies or outsource the rating evaluation to consultancies. Another alternative for companies could be to find or build their own rating models for internal use, which would provide cost savings. In addition, this alternative would enable companies to better explain how the credit ratings have been determined. This study investigates which kind of rating models there are and whether the models could be used in transfer pricing of long-term loans. The research problem of this study is to find the most suitable credit rating models for the case company and to evaluate the ratings for nine group companies. Previous accounting research has showed hundreds of default prediction models and studied, for example, financial ratios' ability to predict failure. The studies have mainly focused on producing models that could discriminate between defaulted and non-defaulted companies as reliably as possible. Taxation research, on the other hand, has mainly paid attention to transfer pricing requirements from a legal point of view. However, the previous research has not combined the perspectives of accounting and taxation. This study consists of a literature review, interviews and the determination of credit ratings. The material used in the literature review consists of journal articles and books from the fields of accounting and taxation. The interviews were carried out either in a semi-structured or an unstructured form. The interviewees included employees working for the case company, a representative of the tax administration, and a consultant specialized in rating models. With the help of the literature review and interviews, potential models to be used in rating determination were found. As a solution to the research problem, the thesis also shows credit ratings for the nine group companies. The study contributes to accounting research by tying together credit ratings and transfer pricing requirements. By combining the perspectives of accounting and taxation, a solution for a real-world problem - credit rating determination for <b>internal</b> <b>loan</b> pricing - is been proposed to be solved. The study also provides new and valuable information about internal loans to taxation professionals. Based on the study, it can be concluded that it is possible to find applicable rating models for transfer pricing purposes from literature and journals...|$|E

40|$|July 29, 2009 We exploit time {{variation}} {{in the degree of}} development of local credit markets and matched workers-firm data with workers histories to asses the role of the firm as an <b>internal</b> <b>loans</b> market. By tilting the workers wage-tenure profile around their tenure-productivity profile the firm can generate borrowing flows from workers to the firm (when the earnings profile is steeper than the productivity profile) or vice versa from the firm to the workers (when the earnings profile is fatter), thus compensating for the imperfect functioning of the loans market. We find that firms located in less financially developed areas offer wages that are lower at the beginning of tenure and higher at the end than those offered by firms in more financially developed markets, which helps firms finance their operations by raising funds from workers. This effect does not reflect unobserved local factors that systematically affect wage tenure profiles, since we control for local market effects and only exploit variation time {{variation in}} the degree of local financial development induced by effects of exogenous liberalization. The credit generated by implicit lending within the firm is economically important and can be as large as 30 % of bank lending.

Consistent with credit market imperfections opening a trade opportunity within the firm we find that the internal rate of return of implicit loans lies between the rate at which workers savings are remunerated and the rate firms pay on their loans from banks. グローバルCOEプログラム = Global COE Progra...|$|R

40|$|On 21 January 1919, twenty-seven of the {{recently}} elected Sinn Féin candidates gathered in Diblin 2 ̆ 7 s Mansion House and established Dáil Éireann.

Even the most skeletal of state administrations required substantial funding in order to build up the various government departments. The first <b>internal</b> Dáil Éireann <b>Loan,</b> launched in August 1919, served as the principle source of finance for Dáil Éireann during its embryonic years.

40|$|We analyse the {{implications}} for the pricing of bank loans of the reform of capital regulation known as Basel II. We consider a perfectly competitive market for business loans where, as in the model underlying the internal ratings based (IRB) approach of Basel II, a single risk factor explains the correlation in defaults across firms. Our loan pricing equation implies that low-risk firms will achieve reductions in their loan rates by borrowing from banks adopting the IRB approach, while high-risk firms will avoid increases in their loan rates by borrowing from banks that adopt the less risk-sensitive standardized approach of Basel II. We also show that only an extremely high social cost of bank failure might justify the proposed IRB capital charges for high-risk loans, partly because the margin income from performing loans is not counted as a buffer against credit losses, and we propose a margin income correction for IRB capital requirements. bank regulation; capital requirements; credit risk; <b>internal</b> ratings; <b>loan</b> defaults; margin income...|$|R
