5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard.</b> The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E

This {{is the first time}} I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> music with any soul to it produced by a mechanical talking machine'... The new instrument is a feat of mathematics and physics. It is not the result of innumerable experiments, but was worked out on paper in advance of being built in the laboratory... The new machine has a range of from 100 to 5,000 , or five and a half octaves... The 'phonograph tone' is eliminated by the new recording and reproducing process.|$|E

500|$|Critics reacted {{favorably to}} the Borg, {{describing}} them as akin to creatures from Hellraiser. Renzetti credited them with breathing [...] "new life" [...] into {{the crew of}} the Enterprise while simultaneously trying to kill them. The Borg Queen received special attention for her combination of horror and seduction; Ebert wrote that while the Queen [...] "looks like no notion of sexy I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of", he was inspired [...] "to keep an open mind". Carr said, [...] "She proves that women with filmy blue skin, lots of external tubing and bad teeth can be sleekly seductive." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul Kelly {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} {{as one of}} Australia's best singer-songwriters. His music style has ranged from bluegrass to studio-oriented dub reggae, but his core output comfortably straddles folk, rock, and country. His lyrics capture Australia's vastness both in culture and landscape; he has chronicled life about him for over 30 years and is described as the poet laureate of Australia. According to music writer Glenn A. Baker, his Australian-ness may be a reason Kelly has not achieved international success. David Fricke from Rolling Stone calls Kelly [...] "one of the finest songwriters I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard,</b> Australian or otherwise." ...|$|E

500|$|At the Old Bailey {{one of the}} {{principal}} crown witnesses was firearms expert Robert Churchill, who testified that the trigger of Mrs Barney's gun had a strong pull. When Hastings rose to cross-examine, he took up the gun, pointed it to the ceiling and repeatedly pulled the trigger over and over again. One crown witness had said that on another occasion she saw Elvira Barney firing the gun while holding it in her left hand; when he called his client Hastings had the gun placed in front of her. After a pause he shouted at her to pick up the gun and she spontaneously picked it up in her right hand. The Judge (Mr Justice Humphreys) described Hastings' final address as [...] "certainly one of the finest speeches I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> at the Bar" [...] and Elvira Barney was found not guilty both of murder and manslaughter.|$|E
500|$|According to screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, Sparrow is a trickster {{who uses}} wit and deceit to attain his goals, preferring to end {{disputes}} verbally instead of by force. He walks {{with a slightly}} drunken swagger and has slurred speech and flailing hand gestures. Sparrow is shrewd, calculating, and eccentric. He fools Norrington and his crew to set sail on the royal ship Interceptor, which compels the admiration of Lieutenant Groves as he concedes: [...] "That's {{got to be the}} best pirate I have ever seen". Norrington himself acquiesces to this praise: [...] "So it would seem", in sharp contrast to what he had previously proclaimed: [...] "You are without doubt the worst pirate I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of". In the third film, while he leaves Beckett's ship stranded and makes off, Lieutenant Groves asks him: [...] "Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{military}} {{penetration of}} southern Florida offered {{the opportunity to}} map a poorly understood part of the country. As late as 1823, official reports doubted {{the existence of a}} large inland lake, until the military met the Seminoles at the Battle of Lake Okeechobee in 1837. To avenge repeated surprise attacks on himself and ammunition stores, Colonel William Harney led an expedition into the Everglades in 1840, to hunt for a chief named Chekika. With Harney were 90soldiers in 16canoes. One soldier's account of the trip in the St. Augustine News was the first printed description of the Everglades available to the general public. The anonymous writer described the hunt for Chekika and the terrain they were crossing: [...] "No country that I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of bears any resemblance to it; it seems like a vast sea filled with grass and green trees, and expressly intended as a retreat for the rascally Indian, from which the white man would never seek to drive them".|$|E

500|$|Ryan {{signed a}} five-album record deal with SYCOmusic {{as part of}} Columbia Records on September 18, 2006. She was the first U.S. artist to sign with SYCOmusic; during the press conference, Simon Cowell called Ryan [...] "potentially {{one of the best}} singers I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> in my life." [...] The {{following}} month, Ryan was in Los Angeles to record her first CD. The self-titled debut was released on November 14, 2006, featuring cover versions of [...] "The Rose" [...] and [...] "I Believe I Can Fly", and original songs like [...] "I Wish That" [...] and [...] "Pray for a Better Day". Eight days later, the album debuted at No. 57 on the Billboard album charts, showcasing [...] "her gargantuan chops and sweet charm". Matt Collar of AllMusic added that the arrangements were [...] "grandiose" [...] for someone of Ryan's age, but they were [...] "more than matched by her truly impressive vocal talent." [...] Los Angeles Daily News reviewer Sandra Barrera wrote that Ryan handled the songs [...] "like the old pro that her big, powerful voice makes you think she is".|$|E
500|$|... "We're from America" [...] is {{the most}} overtly {{political}} song on the album, referencing various aspects of neoconservatism in its lyrics, such as pro-war and anti-abortion rhetoric. [...] "I Have to Look Up Just to See Hell" [...] was described by The Quietus as a [...] "maggot-infested ride into the trough of melancholy." [...] The penultimate track, [...] "Into the Fire", portrays the vocalists' mental state on Christmas Day—wherein he unsuccessfully attempted to contact Wood 158 times, and cut himself on the hands or face with a razorblade for each corresponding attempt. It was the original album closer, with Manson describing it as a [...] "glorious epic that I think will make Twiggy forever recognized as a guitar hero." [...] The album's final song, [...] "15", was completed on Manson's January 5 birthday. He called it [...] "the most important song that's been written by Marilyn Manson as an entity. It's the most unusual song I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard.</b> I thought that the album was done, [...] but {{what was happening in}} my life had not resolved itself. So on January 5, one five, I sang '15', and the lyrics tell the story of that day." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following his typical {{method of}} {{explaining}} by antitheses, Hazlitt contrasts Coleridge and Godwin.

I have heard him both as a temperance and political orator, and I doubt whether during his day any person in either party of the State surpassed him on the hustings. He was elected by a good majority and was re-elected in 1846 and '48, thus serving six consecutive years as a representative from the city.|$|E
2500|$|Henry McBride (art {{critic for}} the New York Sun) did much for Stein's {{reputation}} in the United States, publicizing her art acquisitions and her importance as a cultural figure.
