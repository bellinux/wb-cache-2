5|$|Lazio faced {{a unique}} {{tactical}} problem campaigning upstate. The major issue {{there was the}} persistently weak local economy, which Lazio hoped to link to his opponent's husband's tenure in office. Attacks {{on the state of}} the upstate economy were frequently interpreted as criticism of incumbent Republican governor <b>George</b> <b>Pataki,</b> however, limiting the effect of this line of attack.|$|E
5|$|New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was {{prevented}} by term limits from running for mayoral reelection in 2001, immediately indicated interest. Due to his high profile and visibility, Giuliani {{was supported by}} the state Republican Party, even though he had irritated many by endorsing incumbent Democratic Governor Mario Cuomo over Republican <b>George</b> <b>Pataki</b> in 1994.|$|E

Six candidates, including Brown, entered the race to replace him, with Brown accumulating many endorsements and the backing of organized labor.|$|E

Eisenhower in 1956; since 1960, it has endorsed the Democratic Party nominee in every presidential election (see New York Times presidential endorsements). However, the Times did endorse incumbent Republican mayors of New York City Rudy Giuliani in 1997 and Michael Bloomberg in 2005 and 2009. The Times also endorsed Republican New York state governor <b>George</b> <b>Pataki</b> {{for re-election in}} 2002.|$|E
5|$|New York's 20th congressional {{district}} {{has historically been}} conservative, and early polls favored Tedisco, but by February 2009 the race was considered a toss-up. The Republican Party considered the election to be a referendum on President Obama's economic policy and as such, injected significant funding into Tedisco's campaign, using well-known Republicans such as former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Congressional Minority Leader John Boehner, and former New York Governor <b>George</b> <b>Pataki</b> for support. Democrats used Senator Gillibrand, Vice President Joe Biden, and an endorsement from President Barack Obama to support the Murphy campaign.|$|E

5|$|In August 1998, {{signs were}} {{installed}} along the Meadowbrook State Parkway dedicating {{the road in}} honor of State Senator Norman J. Levy, who died in February 1998 after brain surgery. Levy had served on the State Senate Transportation Committee since 1982 and sponsored the first seat belt law in the United States, and had also {{been part of the}} negotiations that helped work resume on the Meadowbrook–Northern State interchange. The new signs were unveiled in a ceremony in the median of the parkway just south of Merrick Road.

Signs were erected {{at both ends of the}} Meadowbrook Parkway and at a point near the Babylon Turnpike interchange.|$|E
5|$|NY31C {{remained}} unchanged until 2002 when part of Valley Drive was washed out by flooding {{from the nearby}} creek. A bill (S6534, 2002) {{was introduced in the}} New York State Senate on March18, 2002, that would transfer ownership and maintenance of CR105, an alternate route between Jordan and Elbridge on the eastern bank of Skaneateles Creek, from Onondaga County to the New York State Department of Transportation and give Valley Drive to the town of Elbridge and the villages of Jordan and Elbridge. S6534 was passed by the State Senate on April29 and by the Assembly on June20. It was signed into law by Governor <b>George</b> <b>Pataki</b> on August6, 2002, and took effect April1, 2003.|$|E
5|$|New York Governor <b>George</b> <b>Pataki</b> urged {{residents}} to purchase emergency supplies and to fill cars with gasoline. The State Emergency Management Office began {{preparing for the}} hurricane about a week before it moved ashore. The office also issued a Level 1 emergency activation, with a planning unit readying contingency plans and in coordinating the efforts of other state offices. The state's National Guard began preliminary preparations for possible support efforts by reviewing the list of personnel able to be mobilized {{in the event of}} an emergency. Army and Air National Guard officials identified needed equipment {{in the event of an}} emergency, such as helicopters, generators, high-axle vehicles, and communications equipment. State police officers established contingency plans for personnel and equipment to assist as needed. The State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation ensured needed equipment were operational, and also secured buildings with sandbags to prevent flooding. Seven airlines allowed travelers potentially affected by the hurricane to reschedule their flights to a later date.|$|E

5|$|After the Veterans' Mountain Camp {{was closed}} in the 1960s, the {{property}} was sold off to private owners, turning NY971D into {{little more than a}} private drive. Thus, the road saw little use, handling less than 10 vehicles per day on average. As a result, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) no longer considered the highway worthy of inclusion in the state highway system and began to take steps to remove the highway from the system. On February22, 1999, NYSDOT sent a memorandum to the New York State Senate that laid out the groundwork for a bill which, if passed, would allow NYSDOT to remove NY971D from the state highway system once it was able to transfer ownership and maintenance of the highway to another entity. A bill based on the memo was introduced in the State Senate on March29 and eventually passed by the Senate and the New York State Assembly. The bill was signed into law by Governor <b>George</b> <b>Pataki</b> on July27, 1999. The former routing of NY971D is now officially a private drive.|$|E

25|$|Michael C. Finnegan (born 1955 in Peekskill, New York) is the {{managing}} director of investment banking for JPMorgan Chase.

Finnegan was then appointed Chief Counsel to the Governor in 1995.|$|R
50|$|He opposed <b>George</b> <b>Pataki's</b> {{nomination}} {{for governor in}} 1994. Pataki won the election, and as de facto party leader engineered a caucus room coup against Marino {{with the aid of}} much more conservative Republicans from Upstate and Western New York. Despite the fact that Marino's deputy and closest ally, Jess J. Present, was in fact from Western New York, Pataki's opposition and the growth of the budget resulted in his ouster in November 1994. He was succeeded by Joseph Bruno, a conservative from the Capital District.|$|R
25|$|The {{construction}} of the ski area put renewed development pressure on the mountain, especially as its owners dynamited areas to create steeper trails. A proposal to amend the state constitution and trade land closer to the summit ridge to the ski area for holdings elsewhere was vigorously opposed by environmentalists and failed to pass the legislature in the early 1990s. Governor <b>George</b> <b>Pataki's</b> 1999 designation of most Catskill High Peaks as a state Bird Conservation Area, to protect Bicknell's thrush and other threatened montane bird species, finally put the idea to rest.|$|R
