It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought {{it was time for me}} to have my own.|$|E

5|$|Rollason was {{diagnosed}} with colon cancer in 1997, and fought a two-year battle with the disease. A 1998 documentary, Hope for Helen, followed her treatment, and won her much public support for her courage. She continued to work throughout her illness, and shortly before her death was awarded an MBE in the 1999 Birthday Honours. Later that year, the BBC established an award in her memory which is {{presented at the annual}} Sports Personality of the Year awards ceremony. A cancer charity was also founded in her name. Rollason's television career also helped to open up the way for other women to enter the world of sports broadcasting, with presenters such as Sue Barker and Gabby Yorath following in <b>her</b> <b>footsteps.</b>|$|E

As revealed {{over the course of}} the game, Sephiroth was once the most powerful member of SOLDIER, Shinra's elite military division, who was celebrated as a heroic veteran of the Shinra-Wutai war. After the war, however, Sephiroth was sent on a mission to the village of Nibelheim, where he discovered that he was the product of a biological experiment that combined a human fetus with tissue from the extraterrestrial lifeform Jenova. Learning that Jenova, who he comes to consider his [...] "mother," [...] attempted to take control of the Planet 2000 years previously, Sephiroth decides to follow in <b>her</b> <b>footsteps</b> and become a god who would rule over the Planet. He burns down the entire village and kills many, but is assumed dead after a confrontation with Cloud inside a nearby Mako reactor.

500|$|The soap opera's {{producers}} intended Victoria {{to return}} in January 2004 but auditions failed to find a suitable replacement for Tom. Amelia Heinle was later cast in the role and made her first appearance on March 21, 2005. Rachel Kimsey also auditioned for the role and Heinle had auditioned for Mackenzie Browning; Kimsey was given Mackenzie and Heinle was given Victoria. Heinle has stated on many occasions that she had [...] "serious doubts" [...] about taking over Tom's role. In 2013, she recalled on what intimidated her about Tom, saying: [...] "Heather is pure backbone, and that's probably what intimidated me about following in <b>her</b> <b>footsteps</b> because that's not me naturally." [...] In 2008, she took maternity leave and was off-screen for weeks. In March 2011, Heinle announced that she had signed a new contract which would secure her in the role for an unspecified period. In November 2013, {{it was announced that}} Heinle had signed another contract to continue her portrayal of Victoria for an additional two years.|$|E
500|$|Barbauld herself {{believed}} that her writing was noble and she encouraged others {{to follow in}} <b>her</b> <b>footsteps.</b> As Betsy Rodgers, her biographer, explains: [...] "she gave prestige to the writing of juvenile literature, and by not lowering her standard of writing for children, she inspired others to write on a similar high standard". In fact, because of Barbauld, Sarah Trimmer and Hannah More were galvanised to write for poor children and to organise a large-scale Sunday School movement. Ann and Jane Taylor began writing children's poetry, {{the most famous of}} which is [...] "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star". Ellenor Fenn wrote and designed a series of readers and games for middle-class children, including the best-selling Cobwebs to Catch Flies (1784). Richard Lovell Edgeworth began one of the first systematic studies of childhood development which would culminate not only in an educational treatise co-authored with Maria Edgeworth entitled Practical Education (1798), but also in a large body of children's stories by Maria, beginning with The Parent's Assistant (1798). Thomas Day originally began his important The History of Sandford and Merton (1783–89) for Edgeworth's collection, but it grew too long and was published separately.|$|E
500|$|Lessons for Children and Hymns in Prose had, for children's books, an {{unprecedented}} impact; {{not only did}} they influence the poetry of William Blake, William Wordsworth, and Jane Taylor [...] they were also used to teach several generations of school children. Children's literature scholar William McCarthy states, [...] "Elizabeth Barrett Browning could still quote the opening lines of Lessons for Children at age thirty-nine." [...] Although both Samuel Johnson and Charles James Fox ridiculed Barbauld's children's books and believed that she was wasting her talents, Barbauld herself believed that such writing was noble and she encouraged others to follow in <b>her</b> <b>footsteps.</b> As Betsy Rodgers, her biographer explains, [...] "She gave prestige to the writing of juvenile literature, and by not lowering her standard of writing for children, she inspired others to write on a similar high standard."

500|$|Jackson's {{music and}} choreography have {{inspired}} numerous performers. Virgin Records executive Lee Trink expressed: [...] "Janet is an icon and historic figure in our culture. She's {{one of those}} gifted artists that people look up to, that people emulate, {{that people want to}} believe in... there's not that many superstars that stand the test of time." [...] Sarah Rodman of the Boston Herald remarked: [...] "For every hand-fluttering, overwrought, melisma addict out there aping Mariah's dog calls, there's an equal number trying to match Jackson's bubbling grooves and fancy footwork, including Britney Spears, Aaliyah and Destiny's Child." [...] Music critic Gene Stout commented she [...] "has so broadly influenced a younger generation of performers, from Jennifer Lopez... to Britney Spears, who has copied so many of Jackson's dance moves." [...] 'N Sync and Usher have credited her for teaching them how to develop stage show into theatrical performance. Kesha, Beyoncé, Toni Braxton, Aaliyah, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Crystal Kay, Kelly Rowland, Rihanna, and Brazilian singer Kelly Key have all named her an inspiration, while others such as Rozonda [...] "Chilli" [...] Thomas of TLC, Cassie, Nicki Minaj, Keri Hilson, and DJ/singer Havana Brown, have all expressed desire to emulate her. Elysa Gardner of USA Today wrote: [...] "Jackson claims not to be bothered by the brigade of barely post-adolescent baby divas who have been inspired by—and, in some cases, have flagrantly aped—the sharp, animated choreography and girlish but decidedly post-feminist feistiness that have long been hallmarks of her performance style." [...] Adrienne Trier-Bieniek stated [...] "scholars trace the origins of pleasure as a Black feminist commitment within popular culture to Janet Jackson" [...] who inspired the feminist perspective found in many pop stars careers. Those who are considered to have followed in <b>her</b> <b>footsteps</b> have been referred to as [...] "Janet-come-lately's." [...] Other artists who have drawn comparison to her include Mýa, Brandy, Tatyana Ali, Christina Milian, Lady Gaga, Namie Amuro, and BoA. Sociologist Shayne Lee commented that [...] "s Janet enters the twilight of her reign as erotic Queen of Pop, Beyoncé emerges as her likely successor." [...] Joan Morgan of Essence magazine remarked: [...] "Jackson's Control, Rhythm Nation 1814 and janet. established the singer-dancer imprimatur standard in pop culture we now take for granted. So when you're thinking of asking Miss Jackson, 'What have you done for me lately?' remember that Britney, Ciara and Beyoncé live in the house that Janet built." ...|$|E

2500|$|The poem was {{inspired}} by Wordsworth being surrounded by snow, and his sister's memory of a real incident that happened at Halifax. Wordsworth explained the origins when he wrote, [...] "Written at Goslar in Germany in 1799. It was founded on a circumstance told me by my Sister, {{of a little girl}} who, not far from Halifax in Yorkshire, was bewildered in a snow-storm. <b>Her</b> <b>footsteps</b> were traced by her parents {{to the middle of the}} lock of a canal, and no other vestige of her, backward or forward, could be traced.
