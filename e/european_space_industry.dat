In addition, INRiM is also involved in the Galileo development (phase CDE 1), supported by ESA, by designing the time scale algorithm of one of the Galileo ground time laboratories named the Precise Time Facility. A consortium of different industries and UTC (k) laboratories are developing the prototype of the Galileo Time Service Provider, supported by the European Union, with the aim to provide to the Galileo system the necessary corrections to maintain the Galileo system time in agreement with UTC.

40|$|Remote sensing {{is one of}} the {{requisites}} {{for assessing}} the wildfire risk, documenting the spatio-temporal distribution of active fires, and monitoring the impacts of bio-mass burning in order to assess climate change, and to support the surveillance of international conventions. Space-borne remote sensing has not yet provided the performance necessary to detect active fires for fire suppression, but there is great interest in such a capability. Existing space-borne sensors are able to provide information on fire risk, as well as to monitor burned areas. The use of existing space-borne sensors for active fire recognition suffers from serious limitations, such as saturation effects in the mid-infrared channel, and inadequately ling revisit times. They present snapshots of fire occurrences only. Active fire counts derived from existing sensors may be overestimated due to a confusion with hot surfaces and sun glint from reflective surfaces, such as water and clouds, or underestimated due to coarse spatial resolution. The global change research and disaster management communities expect quantitative information on fire characteristics from new and dedicated space-borne fire observation sensors. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer was launched in December 1999 on EOS Terra and will deliver quantitative parameters of wildfires on a global scale, but with 1 - 1. 5 km ground resolution only. The planned US National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System Preparatory Project aims to provide continuation of global observations following the EOS Terra and EOS Aqua missions. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) and its industrial partner OHB-System, have been working on two new space-borne fire missions since 1994 : the DLR small satellite mission BIRD (Bi-spectral IR Detection), and the intelligent infrared sensor system FOCUS to be flown as an early external payload of the International Space Station.

40|$|Nowadays, {{chemical}} propulsion {{is based}} on solid (launch applications like first stage booster) or liquid technologies (primary stages, upper stage engines). Complementary, hybrid propulsion technology, as defined in ORPHEE (Operational Research Project on Hybrid Engine in Europe), appears as {{a new generation of}} advanced space transportation system. Engines based on this innovative propulsion concept can provide advantages like thrust performance, throttling (thrust modulation), versatility (easy adaptation to various configurations), simplicity, safety. It will help to consolidate the long term sustainability and ensure a technology needed by the <b>European</b> propulsion <b>space</b> community to remain independent. ￼￼Hybrid propulsion principle {{is based on}} the injection of a liquid or gaseous oxidizer into the engine combustion chamber where it reacts with a solid fuel to generate hot gases providing the thrust. Enlarging the burning surface is the current proposed solution to reach the needed performance level. It dramatically increases the solid grain volume and the engine weight, limiting the applications. The regression rate is a key parameter controlling the solid fuel grain design. Its increase is a very attractive solution to reduce the grain volume. The main objectives of ORPHEE are to increase versatility of space propulsion systems, to ensure {{a significant increase in the}} performance of a hybrid engine, to improve the solid fuel technological maturity from TRL 1 to 3, to gather the European skills on hybrid propulsion and to ensure <b>European</b> access to <b>space.</b> In near future, the availability of new hybrid engines will allow the access to new space transportation missions. By consolidating the knowledge on this innovative technology and by implementing solutions in upcoming space agencies roadmaps, the <b>European</b> <b>space</b> propulsion community will strengthen its global competitiveness. To achieve the overall objectives described above, numerous measurable objectives have been identified in term of knowledge development and physics understanding, but also in term of technological planning development. �� Performance requirements for two Space transportation applications o Upper stage engine o Booster engine �� Solid fuel formulation characterized by an increased regression rate to reach 3 - 4 mm/s �� Test-firingatlab-scale o Test definition o Material supplying o Grain manufacturing �� Feasibility of models for mastering o Liquid oxidizer injection o Solid fuel regression o Combustion efficiency o Operating effect (chamber geometry, operating pressure, [...] .) �� Demonstrator design for both applications and test bench design for demonstrating advantages of Hybrid engines. The scientific and technological objectives are related to provide <b>European</b> <b>space</b> <b>industries</b> a better and new knowledge on hybrid technology.
