5|$|In 1164-65 Manuel's cousin Andronikos, {{the future}} emperor, escaped from captivity in Byzantium and {{fled to the}} court of Yaroslav in <b>Galicia.</b> This situation, holding out the {{alarming}} prospect of Andronikos making a bid for Manuel's throne sponsored by both <b>Galicia</b> and Hungary, spurred the Byzantines into an unprecedented flurry of diplomacy. Manuel pardoned Andronikos and persuaded him to return to Constantinople in 1165. A mission to Kiev, then ruled by Prince Rostislav, resulted in a favourable treaty and a pledge to supply the Empire with auxiliary troops; Yaroslav of <b>Galicia</b> was also persuaded to renounce his Hungarian connections and return fully into the imperial fold. As late as 1200 the princes of <b>Galicia</b> were providing invaluable services against the enemies of the Empire, at that time the Cumans.|$|E
5|$|Liubartas (baptized Dymitr) was Gediminas' {{youngest}} son. In {{the early}} 1320s {{he married a}} daughter of Andrew of <b>Galicia</b> and ruled Lutsk in eastern Volhynia. After Andrew's and his brother Lev of Galicia's deaths about 1323, Galicia–Volhynia experienced a power vacuum. Rather than promoting Liubartas and risking a war with Poland, Gediminas married his daughter Eufemija to Boleslaw-Yuri II of <b>Galicia.</b> War with Poland was thereby postponed until 1340. The Galicia–Volhynia Wars were settled after 1370, when Poland received <b>Galicia,</b> while Lithuania retained Volhynia. Liubartas died around 1385, having ruled Volhynia for roughly sixty years. He had three sons.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Komnenos {{attempted}} {{to draw the}} Russian principalities into his net of diplomacy directed against Hungary, {{and to a lesser}} extent Norman Sicily. This polarised the Russian princes into pro- and anti-Byzantine camps. In the late 1140s three princes were competing for primacy in Russia: prince Iziaslav II of Kiev was related to Géza II of Hungary and was hostile to Byzantium; Prince Yuri Dolgoruki of Suzdal was Manuel's ally (symmachos), and Vladimirko of <b>Galicia</b> is described as Manuel's vassal (hypospondos). <b>Galicia</b> was situated on the northern and northeastern borders of Hungary and, therefore, was of great strategic importance in the Byzantine-Hungarian conflicts. Following the deaths of both Iziaslav and Vladimirko, the situation became reversed; when Yuri of Suzdal, Manuel's ally, took over Kiev and Yaroslav, the new ruler of <b>Galicia,</b> adopted a pro-Hungarian stance.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about Shvarn and his rule, but historians believe {{he was unable to}} take control of all Lithuania, and ruled only over its {{southern}} portions. He died in 1269 or 1271 in <b>Galicia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tautvilas, Edivydas, and Vykintas {{formed a}} {{powerful}} coalition with the Samogitians, the Livonian Order, Daniel of <b>Galicia</b> (Tautvilas and Edivydas' brother-in-law), and Vasilko of Volhynia {{in opposition to}} Mindaugas. Only Poles, invited by Daniel, declined {{to take part in}} the coalition against the Lithuanians. The dukes of <b>Galicia</b> and Volhynia managed to gain control over Black Ruthenia, an area ruled by Mindaugas' son Vaišvilkas. Tautvilas traveled to Riga, where he was baptized by the Archbishop. In 1250, the Order organized two major raids, one against Nalša land and the other against the domains of Mindaugas and those parts of Samogitia that still supported him.|$|E

5|$|The Diet of the Kingdom of <b>Galicia</b> and Lodomeria, {{and of the}} Grand Duchy of Cracow was the {{regional}} assembly of the Kingdom of <b>Galicia</b> and Lodomeria, a crown land of the Austrian Empire, and later Austria-Hungary. In {{the history of the}} Polish parliaments, it is considered the successor of the former sejm walny, or general sejm of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and also of the sejmik, or local councils, in the territories of the Austrian Partition. It existed from 1861 until the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918.|$|E
5|$|The {{restoration}} {{of relations with}} <b>Galicia</b> had an immediate benefit for Manuel when, in 1166, he dispatched two armies to attack the eastern provinces of Hungary in a vast pincer movement. One army crossed the Walachian Plain and entered Hungary through the Transylvanian Alps (Southern Carpathians), while the other army made a wide circuit to <b>Galicia</b> and, with Galician aid, crossed the Carpathian Mountains. Since the Hungarians had most of their forces concentrated on the Sirmium and Belgrade frontier, they were caught off guard by the Byzantine invasion; this resulted in the Hungarian province of Transylvania being thoroughly ravaged by the Byzantine armies.|$|E
5|$|After the Austrian {{invasion}} of the Duchy of Warsaw, Russia, bound by the treaty of alliance with France, reluctantly entered the war against Austria. The Russian army {{under the command of}} General Sergei Golitsyn crossed into <b>Galicia</b> on 3 June 1809. Golitsyin advanced as slowly as possible, with instructions to avoid any major confrontation with the Austrians. There were only minor skirmishes between the Russian and Austrian troops, with minimal losses. The Austrian and Russian commanders were in frequent correspondence and, in fact, shared some operational intelligence. A courteous letter sent by a Russian divisional commander, General Andrey Gorchakov, to Archduke Ferdinand was intercepted by the Poles, who sent an original to Emperor Napoleon and a copy to Tsar Alexander. As a result, Alexander had to remove Gorchakov from command. Furthermore, there were constant disagreements between Golitsyn and Poniatowski, with whom the Russians were supposed to cooperate in <b>Galicia.</b> As a result of the Treaty of Schönbrunn, Russia received the Galician district of Tarnopol.|$|E

Due to their steep course, few of <b>Galicia's</b> rivers are navigable, other than the lower portion of the Miño and the portions of various rivers that have been dammed into reservoirs. Some rivers are navigable by small boats in their lower reaches: this is taken great advantage of in a number of semi-aquatic festivals and pilgrimages.|$|R

5|$|Eufemija (also {{known as}} Marija, Ofka, and Anka) married Bolesław Jerzy II of <b>Galicia,</b> in modern-day Ukraine, in 1331. The {{marriage}} was engineered in 1323 when the brothers Lev and Andrew of <b>Galicia</b> were slain without leaving heirs. Instead of {{replacing them with}} his own son Liubartas and risking a war with Poland, Gediminas forged a compromise with Władysław I of Poland. Both parties agreed to install Bolesław, cousin of Władysław I and nephew of Gediminas' son-in-law Wacław of Płock, with the marriage to take place later. Bolesław {{at the time was}} fourteen years old. In this way the war for control of Galicia–Volhynia was postponed until after Bolesław's poisoning in 1340; control of the area was not stabilized until 1370. According to Teodor Narbutt, Eufemija was drowned beneath the ice of the Vistula River on 5 February 1342 in order to keep her out of the succession disputes.|$|E
5|$|In 1808 he {{was given}} command of a cavalry {{division}} in Lemberg. In early 1809, Merveldt became a prominent {{member of the group}} pushing for war against France, together with such notables as Archduke Ferdinand, Archduke John, Empress Maria Ludovika of Austria-Este, and Count Heinrich von Bellegarde. In the 1809 campaign, Merveldt's force was stationed in the Bukowina and part of <b>Galicia,</b> and from 1809 to mid-1813, he spent three years in Moravia.|$|E

5|$|Released in 1796, {{following}} the death of Catherine the Great, Potocki retired to Kurów, <b>Galicia</b> (southern Poland). There he devoted himself to historical studies, publishing several books, translations and commentaries. He also wrote poems, but those were never published during his lifteime. Historians still debate over his potential authorship of several anonymous works (primarily political brochures). He distanced himself from activists discussing a new insurrection, but was nonetheless arrested and imprisoned by the Austrian authorities again in the years 1798–1800. In 1801 he joined the Warsaw Scientific Society. He returned to politics shortly after much of <b>Galicia</b> was liberated by Napoleon and attached to the Duchy of Warsaw. During the negotiations with Napoleon in Dresden he contracted severe diarrhea and died on 30 August 1809. He was buried in Wilanów.|$|E
