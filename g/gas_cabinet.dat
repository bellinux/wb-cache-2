50|$|A <b>gas</b> <b>cabinet</b> {{can also}} be {{manufactured}} specifically for a company's needs and at lower cost. It is required that a <b>gas</b> <b>cabinet</b> is used for fire safety for gas cylinders. The requirements vary by state. Many states have no advanced regulations for hazardous industrial gasses since {{there is little or}} no use of such gasses in that state.|$|E
50|$|The {{specifications}} for a <b>gas</b> <b>cabinet</b> detail everything from gas flow rates {{to the physical}} size of the system.|$|E
50|$|Size {{dimensions}} {{specify the}} physical {{size of the}} <b>gas</b> <b>cabinet,</b> distribution system, or its components.Cabinet size - Indicates the physical size of the <b>gas</b> <b>cabinet</b> or {{the body of the}} distribution system.Port/tube size - Indicates the physical size of the tubing or exhaust port connections in the system, typically given in inches based on a sizing standard such as National Pipe Thread (NPT). Sizing is important, as an undersized tube line will result in high pressure drops, while an oversized line will be unnecessarily expensive to install.|$|E
50|$|Reconditioned <b>gas</b> <b>cabinets</b> can be {{more useful}} than non-reconditioned used <b>gas</b> <b>cabinets</b> because of the {{thorough}} process used in professionally reconditioning and testing to ensure all systems meet manufacturer’s specifications. Different types of <b>gas</b> <b>cabinets</b> can be used, depending on the gas type in the cylinder. Automatic <b>gas</b> <b>cabinets</b> with multiple sensors are useful and fulfill many other requirements.|$|R
50|$|These <b>gas</b> <b>cabinets</b> {{are used}} for inert, {{non-reactive}} and non-toxic gases. There are automatic <b>gas</b> <b>cabinets</b> also available and thus these cabinets are less useful when compared to automatic cabinets.|$|R
50|$|These <b>gas</b> <b>cabinets</b> {{are useful}} when {{uninterrupted}} gas flow is required. Auto changeover <b>gas</b> <b>cabinets</b> {{can be defined}} by mass or pressure inputs. There is software also available for multiple cylinder scales on each joint or bank. Purge down and purge up processes can also be performed without any interruption of connected cylinders.|$|R
50|$|A <b>gas</b> <b>cabinet</b> is a {{metallic}} enclosure {{which is used}} to provide local exhaust ventilation system for virtually all of the gases used or generated in the Semiconductor, Solar, MEMS, NANO, Solar PV, Manufacturing and other advanced technologies.|$|E
50|$|The {{materials}} {{used to construct}} the <b>gas</b> <b>cabinet</b> {{are an important part}} of proper system selection. The {{materials used}} for the casing and outer parts must have adequate structural strength, while the materials for the gas handling components must be compatible with the media, temperature requirements, and pressure ratings to prevent leakage, rupture, or contamination.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of monoterpene emission from Pinus densiflora was studied using an environmentally controlled <b>gas</b> <b>cabinet.</b> It {{was found that}} monoterpene emission rate increases exponentially with temperature and is also influenced by light. These observations were explained reasonably by a mechanism whereby monoterpene emission rate depends on the monoterpene amount in the leaf oil and its saturated vapor pressure...|$|E
50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of <b>gas</b> <b>cabinets</b> is to contain {{potential}} leaks in piping and fittings at the cylinder connection. The cabinet must be exhausted by a specifically designed fan and exhaust system. The cabinet exhaust system draws leaking hazardous gasses out of the cabinet. In {{the case of a}} flammable <b>gas</b> the <b>cabinet</b> will contain the flame for a period of time. One can use a newly reconditioned cabinet as well as non-reconditioned used <b>gas</b> <b>cabinets</b> depending on their requirements.|$|R

40|$|University of Pisa {{performed}} experimental {{tests in}} a 1 m 3 facility, which {{shape and dimensions}} resemble a <b>gas</b> <b>cabinet,</b> for the HySEA project, founded by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking with the aim to conduct pre-normative research on vented deflagrations in real-life enclosures and containers used for hydrogen energy applications, in order to generate experimental data of high quality. The test facility, named Small Scale Enclosure (SSE), had a vent area of 0, 42 m 2 which location could be varied, namely on the top or {{in front of the}} facility, while different types of vent were investigated. Three different ignition location were investigated as well, and the range of Hydrogen concentration ranged between 10 and 18 % vol. This paper is aimed to summarize the main characteristics of the experimental campaign as well as to present its results...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen energy {{applications}} {{often require}} that systems are used indoors (e. g., industrial trucks for materials handling {{in a warehouse}} facility, fuel cells located in a room, or hydrogen stored and distributed from a <b>gas</b> <b>cabinet).</b> It may also be necessary or desirable to locate some hydrogen system components/equipment inside indoor or outdoor enclosures for security or safety reasons, to isolate them from the end-user and the public, or from weather conditions. Using of hydrogen in confined environments requires detailed assessments of hazards and associated risks, including potential risk prevention and mitigation features. The release of hydrogen can potentially lead to the accumulation of hydrogen {{and the formation of}} a flammable hydrogen-air mixture, or can result in jet-fires. Within Hyindoor European Project, carried out for the EU Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking safety design guidelines and engineering tools have been developed to prevent and mitigate hazardous consequences of hydrogen release in confined environments. Three main areas are considered: Hydrogen release conditions and accumulation, vented deflagrations, jet fires and including under-ventilated flame regimes (e. g., extinguishment or oscillating flames and steady burns). Potential RCS recommendations are also identified. JRC. C. 1 -Energy Storag...|$|E
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of <b>gas</b> <b>cabinets</b> {{available}} in the market in different gas cylinder configurations, such as 1, 2 and 3 bottle designs. They can be either new, used, or reconditioned. A <b>gas</b> cylinder <b>cabinet</b> can have many features depending on the specific gas. These features include gas sensor, sprinkler head, excess flow sensor, automatic operation with automatic purging and excess pressure sensor.|$|R

5000|$|... 316L Stainless steel became {{industry}} standard for fittings, piping and controls in <b>gas</b> <b>cabinets</b> and distribution {{systems in the}} early 1980s. The material is further improved by electropolishing to render wetted surfaces extremely impervious to the most reactive gasses creating a non-shedding surface. A large industry has grown around supplying these ultra-specialized components and materials.|$|R
50|$|They {{should meet}} the Uniform Fire Code Specifications and the National Fire Protection Association. They need {{to adhere to}} the Compressed Gas Association and Semiconductor Equipment & Materials Institute codes. It is also {{important}} to know whether the cabinet is OSHA compliant. OSHA offers additional safety precautions involving the use of <b>gas</b> <b>cabinets.</b> In the absence of finite specifications or unknowns the user or designer should seek the assistance of an impartial consultant.|$|R

40|$|The Microelectronics Development Laboratory (MDL) {{contains}} 3, 000 m{sup 2 }, Which includes 1, 000 m{sup 2 }of Class I {{clean room}} space. There are 20 laminar flow Class I clean room bays. The MDL supplies several, full-flow process technologies which produce complementary {{metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) integrated circuits using 150 nun diameter silicon wafers. All gases, chemicals and physical hazards used in the fabrication processes are controlled to levels well below regulatory requirements. Facility engineering controls in the MDL include toxic and pyrophoric gas monitoring, interlocks, ventilation, substitution and chemical segregation. Toxic and pyrophoric gases are monitored continuously inside processing tools as well as through the exhaust lines, <b>gas</b> <b>cabinets,</b> the valve boxes, and in general work areas. The toxic gas monitoring systems are interlocked to gas shutoff valves and have both low and high level alarms. In-use process gases are stored in exhausted cabinets. All chemicals and gases are segregated by chemical type. The processes are organized into eight sector areas that consist of photolithography, wet processes, dry etch, ion implant, metals, diffusion, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and chemical mechanical polishing (CW). Each morning, engineering, safety and facilities personnel meet to review the equipment and wafer lot status and discuss processing issues. Hazards are assessed in the MDL with periodic walkthroughs, continuous toxic and pyrophoric gas monitoring and personal monitoring. All chemicals and gases proposed for use in the MDL are reviewed by the industrial hygienist and must be approved by a manager before they are purchased. All new equipment and processes are reviewed by a hazard and barrier committee and cannot be used in the MDL without the committee`s approval and an IH hazard assessment. Overall risk of operating the MDL has been reduced to a level that is as low as reasonable achievable for this research facility...|$|R
40|$|The Hydrogen Safety Panel {{brings a}} broad {{cross-section}} of expertise from the industrial, government, and academic sectors to help advise the U. S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Fuel Cell Technologies Office through its work in hydrogen safety, codes, and standards. The Panel’s initiatives in reviewing safety plans, conducting safety evaluations, identifying safety-related technical data gaps, and supporting safety knowledge tools and databases cover {{the gamut from}} research and development to demonstration and deployment. The Panel’s recent work {{has focused on the}} safe deployment of hydrogen and fuel cell systems in support of DOE efforts to accelerate fuel cell commercialization in early market applications: vehicle refueling, material handling equipment, backup power for warehouses and telecommunication sites, and portable power devices. This paper resulted from observations and considerations stemming from the Panel’s work on early market applications. This paper focuses on hydrogen system components that are installed in outdoor enclosures. These enclosures might alternatively be called “cabinets,” but for simplicity, they are all referred to as “enclosures” in this paper. These enclosures can provide a space where a flammable mixture of hydrogen and air might accumulate, creating the potential for a fire or explosion should an ignition occur. If the enclosure is large enough for a person to enter, and ventilation is inadequate, the hydrogen concentration could be high enough to asphyxiate a person who entered the space. Manufacturers, users, and government authorities rely on requirements described in codes to guide safe design and installation of such systems. Except for small enclosures used for hydrogen <b>gas</b> cylinders (<b>gas</b> <b>cabinets),</b> fuel cell power systems, and the enclosures that most people would describe as buildings, there are no hydrogen safety requirements for these enclosures, leaving gaps that must be addressed. This paper proposes that a technical basis be developed to enable code bodies to write requirements for the range of enclosures from the smallest to the largest...|$|R
50|$|In November 2012, he was {{appointed}} minister of oil and <b>gas</b> to the <b>cabinet</b> headed by prime minister Ali Zeidan. Arusi replaced Abdulrahman Ben Yezza as oil minister. Shortly after his appointment, in December 2012, Arusi announced {{the establishment of the}} National Corporation for the Exploration and Production of Oil and Gas, a national oil company based in Tripoli. In February 2013, he reported that a new oil area was found in Ghadames Basin, about 650 km southwest of Tripoli, in the western Libya. Arusi's term ended in January 2014 and Omar Shakmak {{was appointed}} acting oil minister.|$|R
5000|$|The {{balloons}} and associated equipment are usually {{stored in a}} cabinet {{mounted on a wall}} close to the <b>gas</b> cylinders. The <b>cabinet</b> has three doors one of which opens down and to it the filler stand is attached. At the top of the filler stand is a [...] "L" [...] shaped pipe with two rings, a small one on the bottom and a larger one on the top called the inflation nozzle. The rings stop the tube from dropping through the stand or rising too far when the balloon is inflated. The top ring has several grooves cut into it, to help grip the balloon which is fitted to it.|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{innovations}} {{and modernization}} has greatly {{contributed to the}} development in automobile industry. Automobile has become a huge luxury for everyone in all the countries. All modern automobiles like cars are equipped with air conditioner and heater units. An air conditioner alters the properties of air (temperature and humidity) to more comfortable conditions in building, house or automobile. But despite having various advantages, there are few drawbacks as well. Earlier the external pollution was the main concern but nowadays due to use of air conditioner in the car the fumes like carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide etc. enters inside the cabinet through the inlets of the AC {{if there is any}} leakage. Heater may also produce fumes inside the cabinet if running for long time and ventilation is not there. Fumes like Carbon monoxide is lackluster, unscented, weak and exceptionally lethal and some harmful effects of this gas are cerebral pain, tipsiness, shortcoming, queasiness, regurgitating, midsection agony, and disarray. So a prototype is designed which detects the presence of <b>gas</b> inside the <b>cabinet</b> then alert the user by an alert system and automatically open the window to let the fresh air come inside the vehicle. If the level of CO increases continuously then it will automatically send an alert message with location to the concerned person related to the victim through GSM and GPS...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the analysis {{was to determine the}} failure of the Vent and Purge (V&P) Machine due to potential explosion in the Transuranic (TRU) drum during its venting and/or subsequent explosion in the V&P machine from the flammable gases (e. g., hydrogen and Volatile Organic Compounds [VOCs]) vented into the V&P machine from the TRU drum. The analysis considers: (a) increase in the pressure in the V&P cabinet from the original deflagration in the TRU drum including lid ejection, (b) pressure wave impact from TRU drum failure, and (c) secondary burns or deflagrations resulting from excess, unburned <b>gases</b> in the <b>cabinet</b> area. A variety of cases were considered that maximized the pressure produced in the V&P cabinet. Also, cases were analyzed that maximized the shock wave pressure in the cabinet from TRU drum failure. The calculations were performed for various initial drum pressures (e. g., 1. 5 and 6 psig) for 55 gallon TRU drum. The calculated peak cabinet pressures ranged from 16 psig to 50 psig for various flammable gas compositions. The blast on top of cabinet and in outlet duct ranged from 50 psig to 63 psig and 12 psig to 16 psig, respectively, for various flammable gas compositions. The failure pressures of the cabinet and the ducts calculated by structural analysis were higher than the pressure calculated from potential flammable gas deflagrations, thus, assuring that V&P cabinet would not fail during this event. National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 68 calculations showed that for a failure pressure of 20 psig, the available vent area in the V&P cabinet is 1. 7 to 2. 6 times the required vent area depending on whether hydrogen or VOCs burn in the V&P cabinet. This analysis methodology could be used to design the process equipment needed for venting TRU waste containers at other sites across the Department of Energy (DOE) Complex...|$|R
