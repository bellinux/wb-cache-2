25|$|Charles Dana Gibson <b>dreamed</b> <b>up</b> the magazine's {{most celebrated}} figure {{in its early}} decades. His creation, the Gibson Girl, was a tall, regal beauty. After {{appearances}} in Life in the 1890s, {{the image of the}} elegant Gibson Girl became the nation's feminine ideal. The Gibson Girl was a publishing sensation and earned a place in fashion history.|$|E
25|$|The Land of Oz as {{portrayed in}} the classic MGM musical movie of 1939, is quite {{different}} from that portrayed in Baum's books. The most notable difference is that in the film the entire land of Oz appears to be <b>dreamed</b> <b>up</b> by Dorothy Gale (thus making it a dream world), although, Dorothy earnestly corrects the adults at the end that she was indeed there, and an image of Dorothy's falling farmhouse returning to earth is presented. The apparent message is that one should appreciate one's home, no matter how dull it may look or uninteresting its surroundings may be, for having a home and a family is not something that should be taken for granted. This contrasts sharply with the books, in which Dorothy and her family are eventually invited to move to Oz due to a bank foreclosure on the farm, showing both that Oz is a real place, and that it is a utopia compared to the prairies of Kansas.|$|E

25|$|Biff {{leaves the}} {{restaurant}} in frustration, followed by Happy and two girls that Happy has picked up. They leave a confused and upset Willy {{behind in the}} restaurant. When they later return home, their mother angrily confronts them for abandoning their father while Willy remains outside, talking to himself. Biff tries unsuccessfully to reconcile with Willy, but the discussion quickly escalates into another argument. Biff conveys plainly to his father {{that he is not}} meant for anything great, insisting that both of them are simply ordinary men meant to lead ordinary lives. The feud reaches an apparent climax with Biff hugging Willy and crying as he tries to get Willy {{to let go of the}} unrealistic expectations. Rather than listen to what Biff actually says, Willy appears to believe his son has forgiven him and will follow in his footsteps, and after Linda goes upstairs to bed (despite her urging him to follow her), lapses one final time into a hallucination, thinking he sees his long-dead brother Ben, whom Willy idolized. In Willy's mind, Ben approves of the scheme Willy has <b>dreamed</b> <b>up</b> to kill himself in order to give Biff his insurance policy money. Willy exits the house. Biff and Linda cry out in despair as the sound of Willy's car blares up and fades out.|$|E
500|$|Besides {{interacting}} {{with his wife}} and his sons, Willy spends much time during the play in fantasy conversations with his long-dead brother Ben, whom Willy still idolizes, calling on him for guidance, for instance, when he is fired from his job. Toward {{the end of the play}} - when Willy has <b>dreamed</b> <b>up</b> a scheme to kill himself so that Biff can receive the money from his insurance policy and finally become successful -- he [...] "debates" [...] the merits of his plan with Ben, finally deciding to go ahead with it after Ben (in his mind) comes to agree with him that it's a good idea.|$|E
500|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was similar}} to what Naomi Watts construed, when {{she said in an}} interview, [...] "I thought Diane was the real character and that Betty was the person she wanted to be and had <b>dreamed</b> <b>up.</b> Rita is the damsel in distress and she's in absolute need of Betty, and Betty controls {{her as if she were}} a doll. Rita is Betty's fantasy of who she wants Camilla to be." [...] Watts' own early experiences in Hollywood parallel those of Diane's. She endured some professional frustration before she became successful, auditioned for parts in which she did not believe, and encountered people who did not follow through with opportunities. She recalled, [...] "There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely." ...|$|E

500|$|Lunney {{attracted}} significant {{media attention}} in 1968, {{when he worked}} as lead flight director on Apollo 7, {{the first of the}} manned Apollo flights. Coming as it did after the Apollo 1 fire, the mission was an important test for the Apollo program, and was stressful for astronauts and controllers alike. Lunney had primary responsibility for dealing with the mission commander, Wally Schirra, who repeatedly questioned orders from the ground. Although pressed by reporters in news conferences, Lunney stayed diplomatic and said nothing critical of Schirra. Privately, however, he was extremely exasperated, and later assured his team of young controllers that [...] "manned spaceflight is usually better than this". He was also diplomatic about Donn Eisele's sarcastic comment to the CAPCOM that he would [...] "like to meet the man, or whomever it was, that <b>dreamed</b> <b>up</b> that little gem". The [...] "gem" [...] turned out to be Lunney's.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Henson worked with {{illustrator}} / designer William Stout on {{a feature film}} starring animatronic dinosaurs with the working title of The Natural History Project. In 1991, news stories written around the premiere of The Jim Henson Company-produced Dinosaurs sitcom highlighted the show's connection to Henson. [...] "Jim Henson <b>dreamed</b> <b>up</b> the show's basic concept about three years ago," [...] said a New York Times article in April 1991. 'He {{wanted it to be}} a sitcom with a pretty standard structure, with the biggest differences being that it's a family of dinosaurs and their society has this strange toxic life style,' said [...] Brian Henson. But until The Simpsons took off, said Alex Rockwell, {{a vice president of the}} Henson organization, 'people thought it was a crazy idea.' A New Yorker article said that Henson continued to work on a dinosaur project (presumably the Dinosaurs concept) until the [...] "last months of his life." ...|$|E

The bowl [...] "rests atop a mahogony base", engraved with [...] "the results of the twenty previous Maryland-Navy games", which reach back to the rivalry's origin in 1905. It was designed by Tilghman Company, a family-owned jewelry store in Annapolis, Maryland. The Touchdown Club, founded in 1954, {{has been associated with}} both teams for a long time, and annually hosts a dinner honoring both teams. The trophy has been well received; the Terrapins' Testudo Times newspaper said that having the trophy [...] "awarded by a third party" [...] rather than [...] "having a trophy <b>dreamed</b> <b>up</b> by the administrations at each school to create a more 'rivalry-y' feel" [...] makes the award seem [...] "more legitimate and less cheesy". Sports Illustrated included the award in its list of the 40 most [...] "Unusual Trophies in College Football".|$|E

However, once Michael comes over, he reminds Mayhew that Bell had a million dollars but only $100,000 ever turned up. He figures that Mayhew killed Bell, took the money, and planted the gun in Cooper's house. When Michael demands {{his share of the}} stolen money, he kept stating that there was no money. However, as Michael leaves, [...] Mayhew says that he has the {{remaining}} money for him. Michael leaves, Mayhew goes to the door, and finds out that the police are there. They arrest him. Michael's partner in the [...] "red reality", Efrem Vega (Wilmer Valderrama) admits to Michael that he wasn't sure if his partner had <b>dreamed</b> <b>up</b> the entire thing.

500|$|By {{the middle}} of the season, Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC complained that the Angie storyline was lagging, opining that the revelation that Angie is an eco-terrorist [...] "sounds like a plot summary <b>dreamed</b> <b>up</b> by The Onion wanting to spoof the {{ultimate}} suburban show." [...] Stransky declared that he was [...] "tired of even wondering what's up with the Bolens," [...] as their [...] "who-cares-anyway mystery" [...] storyline continued to move too slowly. However, his interest in the storyline was renewed when John Barrowman joined the show as Patrick Logan, stating that the storyline had [...] "finally gotten hotter and, subsequently, better." [...] Stransky praised the [...] "sweet vendiction" [...] of the conclusion to Angie's storyline in the season finale. Cooper also enjoyed the conclusion of Angie's storyline, scoring her plot in the season finale with a 'B.' She wrote that de Matteo [...] "brought some needed fire and Italian backbone to a very bland street" [...] and was disappointed that the character was written off the series. However, Robert Bianco of USA Today dismissed the finale's devotion to resolving the Bolen family storyline, stating that the audience and other characters were not invested enough in the Bolens to care about their life-threatening predicament or departure. Following the announcement of de Matteo's departure, Ausiello reported that fans had not [...] "warmed to" [...] the character of Angie.|$|E
500|$|Audition {{has been}} read as both feminist and misogynist. Miike {{has stated that}} when he met journalists in the United Kingdom and France, he found they commented on the film's feminist themes when Asami gets revenge on the men in her life. The film sets up Aoyama with traits and {{behaviours}} which could be considered sexist: a list of criteria for his bride to meet, and the phoney audition format he uses to search for future wife. Tom Mes, author of Agitator: The Cinema of Takashi Miike stated that the torture sequence, with the mutilation of Aoyama, {{can be seen as}} revenge from Asami. Dennis Lim of the Los Angeles Times examined similar themes, noting that the film as [...] "ultimately about the male fear of women and female sexuality", noting that women are blatantly objectified {{in the first half of}} the film and in the second half Asami [...] "goes on to redress this imbalance" [...] when she becomes an [...] "avenging angel". Chris Pizzello, writing in the American Cinematographer, stated that one plausible approach to interpreting the film is to see the final act as a representation of Aoyama's guilt at his mistreatment of women and his desire to dominate them. Aoyama develops a paranoid fantasy of an attacking object: because he harbours sadistic thoughts towards women, he develops a fear that the object will retaliate. Contrary to this, Miike has stated that the final torture scenes in the film are not a paranoid nightmare <b>dreamed</b> <b>up</b> by Aoyama. Mes has argued against the feminist portrayal of the film, noting that Asami is not motivated by an ideological agenda, and that acknowledging that she takes revenge on a man who has lied to her would be ignoring that she has also lied to Aoyama. Asami states [...] "I want to tell you everything" [...] during the torture scene, implying she had not been truthful before. Mes also notes that avenging angel theme contradicts the interpretation of a feminist-themed revenge as one of people that Asami's attacks was female.|$|E
