60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at his sister-in-law. 'Do {{you hear}} that?' he asked coldly.|$|E
60|$|He was {{suddenly}} very quiet and still. But <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at her.|$|E
60|$|The red in Maybold's countenance went away: <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> Dick in the face.|$|E
50|$|Sylvester is frantically {{summoning}} the elevator, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> down a corridor, and Tweety/Hyde is ambling along, laughing maniacally.|$|R
6000|$|Re-enter CONSTANT softly with a {{bunch of}} keys in his hand. On [...] his way to the cabinet <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> at NAPOLEON. Seeing [...] the glass and a strangeness in the EMPEROR, he {{abandons}} his [...] object, rushes out, and is heard calling.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> round <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at her sharply, then {{answered}} with great deliberation.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{regarded}} him in wonder; then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> {{all about him}} at the empty hall.|$|E
60|$|On {{a sudden}} I set the portmanteaus {{to the ground}} and halted. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> back at me.|$|E
60|$|She nodded. He {{called to}} a waiter and gave an order. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at her appreciatively.|$|E
60|$|The Colonel {{recovered}} himself slowly, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> round <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at his son.|$|R
60|$|A smile curved Lord Henry's lips, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> round <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at Dorian.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is my brother, and swifter still than I,' {{said the}} horse, 'and he will fly past {{me with a}} rush. Then you must have your sword ready, and take off {{the head of the}} man who sits on him, as <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> at you. <b>And</b> there is no sword in the world that will cut off his head, save only that one.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at her, met the {{appealing}} glance of {{her soft}} {{eyes for a}} moment and looked suddenly away.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Jarvis made a slow retreat {{towards the}} door. Every {{now and then}} <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> back over his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|His fingers {{paused in}} the {{manipulation}} of the tobacco with which he was filling his pipe. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at her.|$|E
60|$|She sat very still. The log {{flared up}} again, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> slowly <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at the shadows in her face.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was hard}} not to be allowed to help--it was hard to wait! When the heart was suffering, it was frightful! <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and,</b> <b>looking</b> furtively about him, lighted a cigar. Yes, it came to every one--at some time or other; and what was it, that death they talked of? Was it any worse than life? That frightful jumble people made for themselves! Poor Nicholas! After all, it was he that had the luck! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You fool! It's {{all right}} It's here still." [...] Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> again <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> {{at the dead}} Chinaman, and then again at the hole.|$|R
60|$|At that he bent {{back his}} head and laughed, which made me redden with anger. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at me more soberly.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> full at her, then exclaimed, [...] "Exactly," [...] and paused, adding, [...] "I {{wonder what}} you want. Has it a form?" ...|$|E
60|$|What {{a dreadful}} minute! <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at my feet. I gave one big twist in my bandages. All held. I wagged my toe.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> round <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at her. She {{often said}} things which {{surprised}} him. A vague smile faded away {{on her lips}} before his scrutiny.|$|R
50|$|In her Richmond motel room, Peggy {{looks out}} her window and sees two dogs mating. She is shocked, then gets {{into bed with}} a glass of wine and her work and smiles. At home, Pete sits in the dark with {{headphones}} on, eyes closed. Roger stands naked on a chair facing the hotel window, arms outstretched. A blonde approaches Don at the bar, tells him her girlfriend (a brunette) is interested, and asks if he is alone. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> at her.|$|R
5000|$|A famous legend {{says that}} when her deposed son Muhammad XII left Granada after its fall, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> around <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> back upon it. Aixa then replied: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at her. He {{was only}} twenty-two years old, {{but there were}} things in his face from which a man might have shrunk.|$|E
6000|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at Medeia. ‘This is your doing, false witch-maid! You {{have helped}} these yellow-haired strangers, and brought shame upon {{your father and}} yourself!’ ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> {{out of the}} window. She sat {{flushed and}} erect for a long time. At length her father turned to her, looking really malevolent.|$|E
50|$|At the gate, {{there is}} a dog named Cerberus, after the three-headed dog of Hades in Greek mythology. During the ritual, the janitor tells Orfeu to call to his beloved by singing. The spirit of Eurydice inhabits the body of an old woman and speaks to him. Orfeu wants to gaze upon her, but Eurydice begs him not to lest he lose her forever. When <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> anyway, <b>he</b> sees the old woman, and Eurydice's spirit departs, as in the Greek myth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Shaggy Man," [...] called Dorothy, and {{ran after}} Toto. The little dog pranced briskly along for some distance; when <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> around <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at his {{mistress}} questioningly.|$|R
60|$|Salensus Oll <b>looked</b> puzzled. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> again <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> upon Dejah Thoris, {{and then}} Thurid stepped {{quite close to}} him and whispered {{something}} in his ear--what, I know not.|$|R
60|$|Before {{she could}} prevent it {{he took them}} up and flicked them over. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> {{at her with a}} smile in his dark eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> back. But {{the man had}} his {{overcoat}} pulled up and his soft hat pulled far down, and Dave could see little of his face.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> down at her. His yellow, dusky-set eyes {{rested on}} her good-naturedly, without seeing her, his lip curled in a self-conscious, contemptuous sort of smile.|$|E
60|$|Benjamin did not wince. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> away <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> {{out across}} the sea for a few moments. The last agony of his great {{renunciation}} was upon him. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> held out his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose he}} had heard I was freshly passed and without {{experience}} as an officer, because <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> about <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> me over as if I had been exposed for sale.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> {{his head}} <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> {{at me for}} a moment reflectively.|$|R
