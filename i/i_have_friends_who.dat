Sooner or later {{your friends are}} sure to find you, {{and they will not}} be content with such a {{statement}} as that. You were summoned one day to Paris by or on behalf of your brother, who had unaccountably disappeared there. You immediately appear to have followed suit. You had no friends in Paris--neither, I think, had he. I believe I am correct in saying that you had neither of you ever been there before. If your brother has fallen into bad hands, and if those same people are trying to work upon your fears by leading you into this sort of thing--well, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> are powerful enough to bring you safely out of any den of thieves in the world. You are in an impossible situation, my dear young lady. Nature never meant you for an adventuress. There is no necessity for you to become one. Why do you look at me like that?" ...|$|E

"Certainly not; {{it would}} not avail to save our lives, and would assuredly cost those of my servitors and most likely of the women. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>friends,</b> <b>who</b> will, I hope, gladly take us in. Maître Lepelletiere, the Master Carpenter, who has been doing my doors, is {{an old friend of}} mine, and after the last attack, urged me to {{withdraw}} for a time from the attention of the mob, and offered me refuge in his place. He lives in the Rue des Fosses; which is close to the old inner wall that is now for the most part in ruins. You pass along by the hospital, and when beyond the old wall turn to the right; 'tis the third doorway. There are no houses facing it, but it looks straight upon the wall, the ground between being some thirty or forty yards wide; and doubtless when the house was built, it was before the present wall was erected, and stood on the outer side of the fosse round the old one. There are many others of the same trade who live in that quarter, and as they are for the most part opposed to the butchers, I doubt not that my friend will have no difficulty in obtaining a lodging for you among them should no other have been settled upon." ...|$|E

My talk of borrowing was but a play and excuse to learn what you knew of Miriam. Nay, do not start, though it may seem strange to you that I also can be subtle. Foolish man, did you think that I with my prospects should be left to lack for a miserable half-talent? Why, there at Jerusalem I could have borrowed ten, or twenty, if I would promise my patronage by way of interest. My servants wait with the gold without. Call them in presently and pay yourself, principal and interest, and something for a bonus. Now for the second, Miriam is a Christian. Beware how you tamper with her faith. It is not mine, but I say--beware how you tamper with it. You gave her father and her mother, your own daughter, to be slaughtered by gladiators and to be torn by lions because, forsooth, they did not think as you do. Lift one finger against her and I will hale you into the amphitheatre at Rome, there yourself to be slaughtered by gladiators, or to be torn by lions. Although I am absent I shall know all that you do, for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> are good and spies that are better. Moreover, I return here shortly. Now I ask you, will you give me your solemn word, swearing it by that God whom you worship, first, that you will not attempt to force your granddaughter Miriam into marriage with Caleb the Jew; and secondly, that you will shelter her, treating her with all honour, and suffering her to follow her own faith in freedom?" ...|$|E

She also {{appeared in}} the award winning film “Microphone” by young director Ahmed Abdallah as well as the romantic comedy “Ezaet Hob” alongside Menna Shalabi, that was released in 2011. Yosra is playing ‘Farida’, a hip energetic girl who is the total opposite of her conservative best friend Leila played by Menna Shalabi who tries to find love throughout the movie, [...] "I liked the plot a lot as we want to prove that friends don’t have to share the same views to be close. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> would go to the beach wearing a swimsuit and I have others who don’t wear one as they’re more conservative, but at the end, all of us are in the same group and we all get together and know how to have a good conversation”, Yosra explains. “The movie also tackles the high tech communication via Blackberry and Facebook and how they interfere in romantic relationships, which resulted in some very funny scenes".|$|E
5000|$|The {{identifying}} {{language of}} the Basques is called Basque or Euskara, spoken today by 25%-30% of the region's population. An idea of the central place of the cultural terms in Basque nationalist politicians is given by the fact that, in Basque, Basques identify themselves by the term euskaldun and their country as Euskal Herria, literally [...] "Basque speaker" [...] and [...] "Country of the Basque Language" [...] respectively. The language has been made a political issue by official Spanish and French policies restricting its use either historically or currently; however, this has not stopped the teaching, speaking, writing, and cultivating of this increasingly vibrant minority language. This sense of Basque identity tied to the local language {{does not exist in}} isolation. It is juxtaposed with an equally strong sense of national identity tied {{with the use of the}} Spanish and French languages among other Basques. As with many European states, a regional identity, be it linguistically derived or otherwise, is not mutually exclusive with the broader national one. For example, Basque rugby union player for France, Imanol Harinordoquy, has said about his national identity:I am French and Basque. There is no conflict, I am proud of both[...] [...] [...] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> are involved in the political side of things but that is not for me.
