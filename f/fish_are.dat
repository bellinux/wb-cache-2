5|$|Arbroath smokies, {{for which}} Arbroath is {{well-known}} nationally and internationally, are made solely in Arbroath following the award of Protected Geographical Indication in 2004, which limits Arbroath smokie production to within 4km of Arbroath. Smokies {{are made from}} haddock using traditional methods {{dating back to the}} late 19th century where the <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> first salted overnight to preserve them, before being left tied in pairs to dry. Next, the dried <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> hung in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire and covered with a lid. After around an hour of smoking, the <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> golden brown and ready to eat. The preparation of smokies remains a cottage industry in Arbroath, centred almost exclusively at the harbour area. However, one larger processor, RR Spink, supplied Arbroath smokies to several UK supermarket chains. It appears that, nowadays, the firm concentrates on smoking other fish such as salmon or trout and no longer supplies the Arbroath Smokie. The company holds the Royal Warrant as a fishmonger to the Queen.|$|E
5|$|Fresh fish {{is readily}} available, caught off Israel's coastal {{areas of the}} Mediterranean and the Red Sea, or in the Sea of Galilee, or raised in ponds {{in the wake of}} {{advances}} in fish farming in Israel. Fresh fish is served whole, in the Mediterranean style, grilled, or fried, dressed only with freshly squeezed lemon juice. Trout (called forel), gilthead seabream (called denisse), St. Peter's fish (known as 'musht') and other fresh <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> prepared this way. <b>Fish</b> <b>are</b> also eaten baked, with or without vegetables, or fried whole or in slices, or grilled over coals, and served with different sauces.|$|E
50|$|Recreational <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> <b>fishing</b> for {{pleasure}} or competition. It can be contrasted with commercial <b>fishing,</b> which <b>is</b> <b>fishing</b> for economic profit, or subsistence <b>fishing,</b> which <b>is</b> <b>fishing</b> for survival.|$|R

5|$|In a few {{northern}} areas, <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> also eaten. In studies {{performed at}} Amchitka Island in the 1960s, where the sea otter population was at carrying capacity, 50% of food found in sea otter stomachs was fish. The fish species were usually bottom-dwelling and sedentary or sluggish forms, such as Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus and family Tetraodontidae. However, south of Alaska on the North American coast, <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> a negligible or extremely minor {{part of the}} sea otter's diet. Contrary to popular depictions, sea otters rarely eat starfish, and any kelp that is consumed apparently passes through the sea otter's system undigested.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), {{allowing}} {{their body}} temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, {{though some of}} the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature. <b>Fish</b> <b>are</b> abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and anglerfish). With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} species are game fish, found in Lake Phelps, are largemouth bass, chain pickerel, catfish, yellow perch and pumpkinseed. These <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> what brought the Algonquian {{to the area}} nearly 10,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of small}} and large fish in the local economy was analyzed. Researchers found that while the less common large <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> sold for profit, the diet of Pak Mun villagers {{consisted}} mostly of small fish which can be caught in both the wet and dry seasons. Small <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> eaten, sold, and traded with the hill peoples for rice.|$|E

5|$|As {{fish stocks}} dwindle {{in the upper}} ocean, deep-sea {{fisheries}} are increasingly being targeted for exploitation. Because deep sea <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> long-lived and slow growing, these deep-sea fisheries are not thought to be sustainable {{in the long term}} given current management practices. Changes in primary production in the photic zone are expected to alter the standing stocks in the food-limited aphotic zone.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} and spring, when the water levels were higher, otters had a greater {{tendency}} to prey upon crayfish (73% of scats had crayfish remains) rather than fish. However, when water levels are lower, crayfish will seek out shelter while fish become more highly concentrated and susceptible to predation. Therefore, <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> more vulnerable to being preyed upon by otters because the crayfish have become more difficult to obtain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>are</b> {{captured}} by cornering them in shallow water, usually against the bank or under logs. They take advantage when {{bodies of water}} begin to dry up in the summer or early fall and gorge themselves on the resulting high concentrations of fish and tadpoles. They were surprisingly unsuccessful at seizing either live or dead fish under water.|$|E

5000|$|Jug <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> an {{unlimited}} class tackle method of fishing that uses lines suspended from floating jugs to catch fish in lakes or rivers. Often, {{a large number}} of jugs are used when jug fishing. In many states, a fisherman could use up to twenty, and jug sets of around twenty are common in practice. [...] Jug <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> most common in southern states where many different kinds of people jug <b>fish.</b> Jugs <b>are</b> often put out at sunset and picked up at sunrise by the whole family. Jug fishing consists of a simple setup where lines are tied onto jugs and weights can be added to the line to keep the jug's location fixed. Jug <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> also subjected to numerous Department of Natural Resources and local water regulations that could include: the number of jugs, dates and times when jug <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> allowed, and if jug <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> even allowed. Many <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> caught on jugs, but the main target of jug <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> often catfish.|$|R

5|$|Several {{animal species}} have been {{introduced}} to Everglades waterways. Many tropical <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> released, the most detrimental being the blue tilapia (Oreochromis aureus), which builds large nests in shallow waters.

5|$|The American white ibis {{prefers to}} eat {{crayfish}} and other crustaceans, but also takes aquatic insects and small fish. Outside the nesting season, the diet is highly variable, as abundance {{and types of}} prey depend on the both region and habitat. In Los Llanos, located {{on the border of}} Colombia and Venezuela, the most frequent prey are insects, such as fly larvae and beetles. Generally in North America the main prey are crustaceans, mostly crayfish. In the Everglades and cypress swamps, the diet is primarily made up of crayfish, while those that feed in willow ponds eat predominantly fish. American white ibises that feed in mangrove swamps focus on crabs. The tactile nature of the ibis's probing for food in mud means that it catches prey that are too slow to evade the ibis once located by its bill. In the Everglades, this means that crayfish make up {{a large part of the}} diet, but a more diverse array of invertebrates are taken in coastal areas. Although crayfish are sought by foraging ibises, prey switching to fish does occur if <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> found in great abundance. It is unclear whether the <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> more easily caught if overcrowded, or whether sheer numbers of fish mean that ibises are catching them instead of crayfish—normally, <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> more agile than crayfish and hence elude the ibis's bill more easily. <b>Fish</b> <b>are</b> a more energy-rich source of food for the American white ibis. In the breeding season, American white ibises in a colony at Pumpkinseed Island travelled further to forage in freshwater wetlands and catch crayfish, than nearby saltwater areas where fiddler crabs predominated, indicating their benefit was worth the extra energy expended in fetching them for their young. This travel results in the wholesale transport of nutrients across the landscape by the colony; in a successful breeding year the colony at Pumpkinseed Island was estimated to have contributed a third as much phosphorus to the neighboring estuary as other environmental processes.|$|E
