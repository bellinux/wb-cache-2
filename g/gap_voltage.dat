In this application, the STJ is dc biased at a voltage just below the <b>gap</b> <b>voltage</b> (|V| = 2Δ/e). A high frequency signal from an astronomical object of interest is focused onto the STJ, along with a local oscillator source. Photons absorbed by the STJ allow quasiparticles to tunnel via the process of photon-assisted tunneling. This photon-assisted tunneling changes the current-voltage curve, creating a nonlinearity that produces an output at the difference frequency of the astronomical signal and the local oscillator. This output is a frequency down-converted version of the astronomical signal. These receivers are so sensitive that an accurate description of the device performance {{must take into account}} the effects of quantum noise.|$|E

40|$|The {{project on}} {{developing}} compact medical accelerators for the tumor therapy using carbon ions has been {{started at the}} National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS). Alternating-phase-focused (APF) linac using an interdigital H-mode (IH) cavity has been proposed for the injector linac. The IH-cavity is a doubly ridged circular resonator loaded by the drift-tubes mounted on ridges with supporting stems. The effects of intrinsic and random field distortions in a practical design of the 4 -Mev/u 200 -MHz IH-APF linac are considered. The intrinsic field distortions in the IH-cavity are caused by an asymmetry of the gap fields due to presence of the stems and pair of ridges. The random field distortions are caused by drift-tube misalignments and non-regular deviations of the <b>gap</b> <b>voltages</b> from programmed values. The RF fields in the IH-cavity have been calculated using Microwave Studio (MWS) code. The effects of field distortions on beam dynamics have been simulated numerically. The intrinsic field distortions are negligible for this IH-APF linac. The random field distortions cause a serious degradation of the beam transmission. The levels of permissible errors for the drift-tube longitudinal and transversal displacements are about ± 200 µm and ± 100 µm, respectively. The fluctuations of the <b>gap</b> <b>voltages</b> should be minimized to the levels of about ± 3 %. At this level of tolerances the beam transmission is decreased about 10 % (standard-deviation value) comparing to the beam transmission for the ideal structure.

This technique removes materials from the workpiece by thermal energy exerted from series of electrical sparks. Using copper foil as assisting electrode (AE), machining of Al 2 O 3 is done successfully. In this investigation, experiments were performed to study the effect of <b>gap</b> <b>voltage</b> and pulse-on time on material removal rate (MRR) for EDM of Al 2 O 3.

However, {{it is difficult to}} achieve the full cell equalization for the SC equalizers due to the inevitable voltage drops across Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) switches. Moreover, when the <b>voltage</b> <b>gap</b> among cells is larger, the balancing efficiency is lower, while the balancing speed becomes slower as the <b>voltage</b> <b>gap</b> gets smaller.
