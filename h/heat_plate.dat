40|$|AbstractSolar {{high-temperature}} {{thermochemical process}} is a promising concept to produce hydrogen as well as basic chemical materials by concentrated solar energy. An important feature of this technology is {{the design of a}} satisfactory reactor. A novel solar high-temperature thermochemical coupled phase-change reactor based on a special-shaped high-temperature heat pipe (SHHP) receiver is presented. The SHHP integrated with phase-change heat transfer, temperature leveling of heat pipe and <b>heat</b> <b>plate</b> (flat plate heat pipe) separates the upper reaction chamber and the lower solar absorber. In this manner, radial temperature gradient in absorber and axial temperature gradient in reaction chamber will be lowered, thus to enhance safety and thermochemical conversion efficiency of the solar reactor. A three-dimensional model of the reaction chamber coupling heat transfer with nitrogen as working fluid instead of reactants is developed to optimize geometry configurations. The temperature distribution of the reactor wall and the working gas are presented. The impact of the inlet/outlet configurations and arrangement of heat pipes in <b>heat</b> <b>plate</b> are investigated.

Consequently Alfa Laval Vicarb has developed a new structured heat exchanger reactor. The design of the reactor is based on high performances <b>heat</b> <b>plate</b> exchanger in which small inserts allow a good mixing of the reactants and to improve the heat transfer phenomena or to increase the heat transfer coefficient. This new technology of <b>heat</b> <b>plate</b> exchange reactors has a modular structure where the exchange zones have two possible configurations: co- and counter counter-current. The structure of the reactor is also flexible, that makes possible to have multiple reactants injections and different local temperature control points. In order to have a rapid prediction of conversion and temperature profiles, a mathematical model conserving the same notion {{of the structure of the}} reactor has been developed. This mathematical model is a simple compartmental model which presents advantages in terms of flexibility, possible online simulations and rapid prediction simulations. The structure of the model has been determined with the help of tracer experiment and computational fluid dynamics simulations. Heat and mass transfer equations are written considering each cell and using experimental heat transfer data then chemical kinetics from literature are introduced to the model. A sub-compartmental model has been developed in order to predict the micro-mixing phenomena. Four reactions for which the kinetic laws of reactions are well known have been selected to test the model: alkaline hydrolysis of ethyl acetate, alkaline hydrolysis of ethylene glycol diacetate, oxidation of sodium thiosulphate by hydrogen peroxide and Bourne reactions. The results of comparison between simulations and experimental data in terms of yield, selectivity, temperature profiles and micro-mixing characteristics are in reasonable agreement...|$|E

These rehabilitation measures were taken for a better comfort and to reduce energy (thermal and electric) consumptions. Among modernization solutions we can mention: utilization of <b>heat</b> <b>plate</b> exchangers with high efficiency and smaller dimensions, implementation of control, measurement and automatic regulation equipment, improvement of process regulation principles, introduction of compact small-scale substations. Present article refers to an energetically analysis for a small-scale modern substation which is equipped with 2 <b>heat</b> <b>plate</b> exchangers (one for heating process and another for hot water supply), hot water storage tank, regulation, measurement and pumping equipment. This modern substation was a result of a research theme directed by Technical University of Civil Building Engineering-Faculty of Building Services Engineering Bucharest and it was installed and made functional in February, 2007, in Bucharest. The substation supplies hot water and thermal energy for heating for a riser of a block with 10 floors and 32 apartments. In the current article a comparative analysis of energy consumptions for a constant or variable speed pump is shown. The pump refers to the heating circuit of the substation and the analysis took into consideration 3 scenarios: constant or variable speed of the pump, constant or variable indoor temperatures inside the rooms of the apartments, different meteorological times during the heating period. The simulations were obtained with the help of performant computer software TRNSYS and the results could be validated in the next heating season and also with the measured parameters in the modernized substation.

They are likely tidally locked and synchronously rotating around their parent stars and, if an atmosphere is absent, have surface temperature contrasts of many 100 's to 1000 's K between permanent {{day and night}} sides. We investigated the effect of elevated surface temperature and strong surface temperature contrasts for Earth-mass planets on the (i) pattern of mantle convection, (ii) tectonic regime, and (iii) rate and distribution of partial melting, using numerical simulations of mantle convection with a composite viscous/pseudo-plastic rheology. Our simulations indicate that, if a close-in rocky exoplanet lacks an atmosphere to redistribute heat, a >~ 400 K surface temperature contrast can maintain an asymmetric degree 1 pattern of mantle convection in which {{the surface of the}} planet moves preferentially toward subduction zones on the cold night side.

The dimples are placed either in an inline or a staggered layout. A smooth channel with pure dimples and a smooth channel with pure DWVGs are studied, in which the smooth channel with DWVGs is considered as baseline. The Reynolds number is ranging from 4000 to 40, 000. Results of the flow structure, <b>heat</b> <b>plate</b> Nu number, friction factor, temperature and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) are included. The {{results show that the}} adoption of dimples significantly impacts the flow structure by interacting with the vortex which is generated by the DWVGs. A small part of the vortex moves downward and impinges on the inline arranged dimpled surface, which is beneficial for the heat transfer enhancement. However, for the staggered arrangement of dimples, the vortex flow is lifted upward before it impinges on the dimple surface. In this case, the inline arrangement dimples provides the best mixing and the highest heat transfer performance. The heat transfer is augmented by 36. 23 % while the friction factor is increased by 36. 29 % compared to the Baseline, respectively. The thermal performance analysis indicates that the use of dimples increases the thermal performance by 28. 50 %.
