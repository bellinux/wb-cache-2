40|$|Relaxin- 3 is a neuropeptide {{belonging}} to the relaxin/insulin superfamily. Studies using rodents have revealed that relaxin- 3 is predominantly expressed in neurons in the nucleus incertus (NI) of the pons, the axons of which project to forebrain regions including the hypothalamus. There is evidence that relaxin- 3 is involved in several functions, including food intake and stress responses. In the present study, we generated relaxin- 3 gene knockout (KO) mice and examined them using a range of behavioral tests of sensory/motor functions and emotion-related behaviors. The results revealed that relaxin- 3 KO mice exhibited normal growth and appearance, and were generally indistinguishable from wild genotype littermates. There {{was no difference in}} bodyweight among genotypes until at least 28 [*]weeks after birth. In addition, {{there were no significant differences}} between wild-type and KO mice in locomotor activity, social interaction, <b>hot</b> plate <b>test</b> <b>performance,</b> fear conditioning, depression-like behavior, and Y-maze <b>test</b> <b>performance.</b> However, in the elevated plus maze test, KO mice exhibited a robust increase in the tendency to enter open arms, although they exhibited normal performance in a light/dark transition test and showed no difference from wild-type mice in the time spent in central area in the open field test.

Three different self-reports and a <b>performance</b> <b>test</b> were used to measure physical performance. Additionally, rating of perceived exertion was measured after the subjects lifted a reference weight to predict maximal lifting performance. The controls were age, gender, educational level, subjectâ€™s participation in fitness, availability of reference data, motivation, attitude, general self-efficacy, and mood.
