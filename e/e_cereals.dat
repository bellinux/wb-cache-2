40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{evidence}} on smallholder market participation, {{with a focus on}} staple foodgrains (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>cereals)</b> in eastern and southern Africa, in an effort to help better identify what interventions are most likely to break smallholders out of the semi-subsistence poverty trap that appears to ensnare much of rural Africa. The conceptual and empirical evidence suggests that interventions aimed at facilitating smallholder organization, at reducing the costs of intermarket commerce, and, perhaps especially, at improving poorer households' access to improved technologies and productive assets are central to stimulating smallholder market participation and escape from semi-subsistence poverty traps. Macroeconomic and trade policy tools appear less useful in inducing market participation by poor smallholders in the region. ...|$|E

40|$|Human {{activities}} are affecting {{the composition of}} the atmosphere, influencing global and regional temperatures and rainfall and through these a large range of physical and biological processes. These changes appear likely to continue over the forthcoming century. As climate and atmospheric CO 2 concentration are key factors in influencing plant production and other ecosystem processes such as decomposition, {{it is not surprising that}} changes in these will have consequences for the functioning of cropping systems. These consequences are likely to vary widely depending on the cropping system being investigated (i. <b>e.</b> <b>cereals</b> vs forage crops vs perennial horticulture), the region and the likely climate changes. For many cool-temperate systems, the prospect of global warming may bring new opportunities provided rainfall doesn’t decline substantially. For warm-temperate and tropical regions, the impacts may be significant and negative with increasing water stress, increasing problems associated with high-temperature conditions and a need for either substantial change in varieties and management activities or land-use change. There are a large number of adaptation options that may be explored to minimise negative impacts of climate changes and to take advantage of positive changes. These can be categorised as operating within different time-scales (i. e. short-term or long-term) or different spatial scales (i. e. farm...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Human {{activities}} {{are projected to}} lead to sub-stantial increases in temperature that will impact northern Europe during winter and southern Europe during summer. Moreover, {{it is expected that}} these changes will cause increasing water shortages along the Mediterranean and in the south-west Balkans and in the south of European Russia. The consequences on the European agricultural ecosystems are likely to vary widely depending on the cropping system being investigated (i. <b>e.</b> <b>cereals</b> vs. forage crops vs. perennial horticulture), the region and the likely climate changes. In northern Europe, increases in yield and expansion of climatically suitable areas are expected to dominate, whereas disadvantages from increases in water shortage and extreme weather events (heat, drought, storms) will dominate in southern Europe. These effects may reinforce the current trends of intensification of agri-culture in northern and western Europe and extensification and abandonment in the Mediterranean and south-eastern parts of Europe. Among the adaptation options (i. e. autonomous or planned adaptation strategies) that may be explored to minimize the negative impacts of climate changes and to take advantage of positive impacts, changes in crop species, cultivar, sowing date, fertilization, irriga-tion, drainage, land allocation and farming system seem to be the most appropriate. In adopting these options, however, it is necessary to consider the multifunctional role of agriculture and to strike a variable balance between economic, environmental and economic functions in dif-ferent European regions...|$|E
40|$|The {{consequences}} of changed global climate conditions, {{connected to the}} increase of greenhouse gas, made the European Union set challenging objectives in terms of improving energy efficiency and use of renewable energy sources. Within this framework, agriculture plays a significant role, mainly by energy use for protected cultivation. In the present paper the potential of biomass resources for bioenergy production on a farm and use for tomato greenhouse production was investigated. One {{of the characteristics of}} a greenhouse farm in Southern Italy, as in many similar cases in the Mediterranean basin, is its production diversification in order to spread economic risks by diversified agricultural production. A greenhouse farm located in Basilicata Region (Southern Italy) was therefore analyzed. Biomass residues from additional agricultural production (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>cereals,</b> olives, grape and livestock), such as straw, pruning from orchards, livestock manure, etc., could be used for heating and electric power in the greenhouse. The quantity of these agricultural residues, the lower heating value (LHV) and the humidity for different types of biomass were estimated, and an energy balance for the greenhouse farm formulated. An analysis was carried out comparing the energy production from agricultural residues and the energy demand for greenhouse tomato production, then the global energy efficiency of the system was estimated. From the results it can be concluded that 50...|$|E

Citrinin (CIT) is another important mycotoxin, too, and its research turns towards nephrotoxicity. Both additive and synergistic effects have been described in combination with OTA. OTA is produced in foodstuffs by Aspergillus Section Circumdati (Aspergillus ochraceus, A. westerdijkiae, A. steynii) and Aspergillus Section Nigri (Aspergillus carbonarius, A. foetidus, A. lacticoffeatus, A. niger, A. sclerotioniger, A. tubingensis), mostly in subtropical and tropical areas. OTA is produced in foodstuffs by Penicillium verrucosum and P. nordicum, notably in temperate and colder zones. CIT is produced in foodstuffs by Monascus species (Monascus purpureus, M. ruber) and Penicillium species (Penicillium citrinum, P. expansum, P. radicicola, P. verrucosum). OTA was frequently found in foodstuffs of both plant origin (<b>e.</b> g., <b>cereal</b> products, coffee, vegetable, liquorice, raisins, wine) and animal origin (e. g., pork/poultry).

40|$|Background and objectives: Lipotropes are food {{components}} that limit excessive hepatic triglyceride contents or steatosis. Steatosis is {{often associated with}} obesity and type 2 diabetes, and may lead to more serious pathologies such as steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis, and/or cancer in the end. Yet, whereas steatosis concerns several millions people worldwide, the lipotropic potential of foods has never been studied; and lipotrope-rich foods remain quite unknown. Based on available food data, our objective was to characterize and quantify the lipotropic potential of plant-based foods to improve nutritional recommendations for subjects at risk of hepatic steatosis. Methods: From lipotrope contents found in literature and nutritional tables (mainly USDA food composition tables), 132 plant-based foods, 4 main lipotropes (betaine, choline, myo-inositol and methionine), and 4 micronutrients that support lipotropic action of the main lipotropes (niacin, pantothenic acid, folates and magnesium) could have been selected. Plant-based food lipotropic potential was expressed into a new index, the Lipotropic Capacity (LC) that integrates the sum of the 8 lipotropic densities relative to a reference food. Results: Vegetables are the best source of lipotropes on a 100 kcal-basis and plant-based foods are a more diversified - but complementary - source of lipotropes than animal-based products. Technological processes reduce plant-based foods lipotropic potential by around 20 %: while refining, then thermal treatments, are the most drastic treatments, fermentations may event tend to increase lipotrope densities. By comparing lipotrope consumption via both French standard diet (INCA 2 survey) and Food guide pyramid, we evaluated that our consumption in betaine, choline and myo-inositol should be increased: this can be easily reached by choosing lipotrope-dense foods like beetroot, spinash or coffee. On a one euro-basis, grains products (i. <b>e.</b> <b>cereals,</b> nuts and leguminous and oleaginous seeds) are the best compromise between a high LC and a cheap supply in lipotropes. Conclusions: Plant-based foods are relevant sources of lipotropes for preventing hepatic stetaosis. In addition, the LC allows easily ranking foods according to their lipotropic potential. But, it remains indispensable to carry out studies in humans to relate food LC with prevalence of hepatic steatosis...|$|E
40|$|In 2011, the Philippines ranked 7 th in {{the world}} in fish production. It {{produced}} 4. 97 thousand metric tons of fish, mollusks, crustaceans, and aquatic plants (seaweeds). The Philippines also ranked 11 th in aquaculture production with 1. 22 % of the world s aquaculture production of 62. 7 million metric tons (mt). Aquaculture in the Philippines generally depends on commercially-milled aquafeeds which in 2012 amounted to 61, 846 mt. Aquaculture feed is composed of 24. 3 % fish meal. Fish-by-catch is associated with trash fish. Utilization of trash fish in the country in each segment could be summarized as: (1) for human consumption; (2) for processing of fish sauce; (3) for production of fish meal; and, (4) as direct feed for aquaculture. In 2013, about 15 thousand mt (24. 3 %) of fish meal were used wherein 3. 97 thousand mt is imported while about 11 thousand mt is assumed to come from the local fish meal. The product lines of these plants are tuna and sardines based meal using heads, tails and whole fish rejected from tuna and sardine canneries. Local fish meal has around 50 - 55 % protein content. Due to limited production and high cost of fish meal, the use of alternative feed ingredients for aqua feed sources are being utilized which include: a) legumes; b) Ipil-ipil leaf meal; c) miscellaneous fodder plants, such as the leaves and other aerial parts of papaya, water hyacinth, Ipomea and sweet potato; d) roots and tubers like arrow roots (Maranta arundinacea), sweet potato(Ipomea batatas L.), cassava (Manihot escolenta Crantz), taro (Colocasia esculenta L.), and elephant yam (Amorphophallus campanulatus); <b>e)</b> <b>cereals</b> and cereal by-products like rice bran and maize and f) oil cakes and oil meals. For feeds of animal origin, African snail meal, Giant toad meal, fish silage, feather meal, maggot meal, mussel (tahong) meal, and Superworm, Zophobas morio are identified. To improve the efficiency of feeding, there are three (3) practices being used in the Philippines. These are a) biomass feeding, b) satiation or Ad Libitum, and c) the use of automatic and demand feeder. For organic aquaculture, azolla and lemna (duckweed) are being cultured in separate ponds or in hapas installed within the ponds and feeding is being done by scooping the plants out to feed the fish. In contrast, lab-lab, an association of microbenthic organism is grown in the ponds using organic fertilizer...|$|E

This paper {{is dedicated to the}} agricultural drought. Irrigation is the most effective protection of crops against drought. The paper presents results of the calculations of the irrigation water requirements (for sprinkler irrigation) with the method of retrospective moisture balance (RVB) for representatives of main sorts of crops, i. <b>e.</b> <b>cereals,</b> technical crops, root-crops, fodder crops, vegetables (concretely perennial wheat, sugar-beet, new petatoes, alfaalfa, cucumbers) in the semiarid regions of the Czech republic (Southern Moravia, South-East Moravia, Middle Moravia, Žatecko and Lounsko, Litoměřicko, Middle Bohemia and Easter Bohemia) represented with 10 technical series (see tab. II) for recent years 1961 – 2000 and to the time horizons of years 2025, 2050 and 2075 with respect to a possible climatic change. The input meteorological data changes (average daily temperatures, daily precipitations and average daily air humidity) for calculations of irrigation water requirements to the introduced time horizons were realized by the help of the outputs of the scenarios for Bohemia and Moravia ascertained with the model of a climatic change HadCM 3 (Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3). The results of the calculations for an average and a drought year (in tab. III) were the base for the determination of development trends of an irrigation water requirement for choosen crops to the year time horizons 2000, 2025, 2050, 2075. These trends were generally analysed for the all monitored semiarid regions of Bohemia and Moravia by means of regression straight lines (an example is shown in fig. 2). The results gained by means of the regress analysis are in tab. IV. They reflect the fact that the irrigation water requirement has an advancing development trend at all of chosen crops for an average and a dry year with an increase in a future time horizon. Simultaneously it is evident that values of the irrigation water requirements are in an average and a drought year for semiarid areas in Moravia, excepting insignificant exemptions, mostly bigger than these values for semiarid areas in Bohemia. The obtained results show, if irrigation will be expanded in the Czech republic, it´s necessary, by taking into an account all the time more accurate informations concerning the climatic change, to dedicate the permanent attention to the irrigation water requirements in semiarid areas of the Czech Republic, not only for separate crops but also for the whole cropping structures. The knowledge of the irrigation water requirements is an important base above all for the assesment of irrigation areas and the size of irrigation water resources...|$|E

40|$|The spatial {{patterns}} of the variability of the appearance dates of the honey bee Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidea) and the small white Pieris rapae (L.) (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) were investigated in Spain. A database of more than 7, 000 records of the dates of the first spring sightings of each species in more than 700 localities from 1952 - 2004 was used. Phenological data were related to spatial, topographical, climate, land use, and vegetation productivity explanatory variables by means of multiple regression models in order {{to search for the}} environmental mechanisms underlying the observable phenological variability. Temperature and altitudinal spatial gradients accounted for most of the spatial variability in the phenology of the studied species, while vegetation productivity and land use had low relevance. In both species, the first individuals were recorded at those sites with warmer springs and dry summers, at low altitudes, and not covered with dry farming (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>cereal</b> crops). The identity and magnitude of the effect of the variables were almost identical for both species and closely mirrored spatial temperature gradients. The best explanatory models accounted for up to half of the variability of appearance dates. Residuals did not show a spatial autocorrelation, meaning that no other spatially structured variable at our working resolution could have improved the results. Differences in the spatial {{patterns of}} phenology with regard to other taxa, such as arrival dates of migratory birds, suggest that spatial constraints may play an essential role in the phenological matching between trophic levels.

40|$|The study {{presents}} a palaeoenvironmental reconstruction based on pollen, no-pollen palynomorphs (= NPPs) and microcharcoals analyses on samples of two cores (PL 1 e PL 2) taken at Piano Locce (1225 m a. s. l., Barisciano, L'Aquila - Italy), within a multidisciplinary programme. Piano Locce is a tectono-karstic depression {{on the southern}} side of the “Massiccio del Gran Sasso d’Italia” mountain {{and it is a}} hollow that trapped the sediments eroded from the soils of the sorrounding mountains and the wind carried pyroclastic ashes. Methods – Core PL 1, drilled in 2003, 80 m long without reaching the limestone at the base, was sampled for pollen analysis following the stratigraphy to obtain an ample vegetational/climatic reconstruction. Core PL 2, drilled in 2008, 10 m long, was sampled approximately every 5 - 10 cm to obtain a detailed reconstruction of the floristic-vegetational/climatic events and of human impact during the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene. For this study 91 of the 260 samples taken from the two cores were studied: 10 from PL 1 core (from 0 to 5. 14 m) and 81 from PL 2 core. The finds analysis, the data exposition and the results interpretation principles followed the current standards. For microcharcoals a particle-count method that divides them in 5 classes was carried out. Chronology – Two datings based on chemical analysis of volcanic minerals are available: core PL 1 is dated 170. 000 - 200. 000 years BP at the bottom and core PL 2 is dated 36. 000 years BP at 5 m depth. Results, Discussion, Conclusions – Pollen analysis of Piano Locce series (46. 150 pollen finds in the two cores) provides the history of vegetal landscape from 36. 000 years BP, plus former data. The finding of high percentage of Artemisia pollen, with Chenopodiaceae and Poaceae and low percentage of arboreal plants suggests, for {{the lower part of the}} sequence, a steppe vegetation environment referable to the Last Glacial. In this part some zones may be included in the Last Glacial Maximum (minimum of woody plants pollen), in the interstadial Bolling-Allerod (low Artemisia, relative increase and differentiation of trees/shrubs) and in the Younger Dryas (arboreal plants decrease and Artemisia rise). The transit from the Last Glacial to the Holocene is testified by an arboreal plants increase and the affirmation of mixed Oak-wood (at about 1. 50 m depth in PL 2). Data suggests that in the area a grass-land grazed quite precociously persisted during the time. Wood always remained far from Piano Locce depression and it was formed alternatively by conifers and broadleaves and subsequently by the predominance of Oak-wood broadleaves. Beech-wood is little represented, probably due to local climatic factors. The combination of Cultivated/cultivable plants begins to be significant in the Medium Holocene and it is obvious in the Upper Holocene. This is testified by Castanea, Juglans, Olea, Vitis <b>e</b> <b>cereals.</b> Prunus dulcis was found in the most superficial samples. NPPs (1. 797 finds identified in PL 2 core) in the Upper Pleistocene show mainly algal microremains (Pediastrum and Botryococcus colonies and Spirogyra spores) attesting a lacustrine sedimentation, while coprophilus fungi spores appears in good percentage during the Holocene, in a terrestrial environment with periodical water puddles. This fungi presence, like Sporormiella-type, Sordiaria-type, Apiosordiaria and Valsaria-type, in levels caracherized by Cichoriodeae, Asteroideae, Cirsium-type, Galium-type, Ranunculaceae, Stellaria-type pollen suggests the hypothesis that Piano Locce depression was exploited as a grazing area, first by wild animals, then by domestic ones. Microcharcoals (analyzed in PL 2 core) are less represented in the lower part of the sequence, maybe due to the presence of humans living in caves and shelters settled in areas at lower quotes than Piano Locce. The presence of bigger sized particles testifies nearer fires, natural or caused by the hunter-gatherers that hunted in the area. During the Holocene the sum of microcharcoals increases, according to the evidence of anthropization provided by pollen and no-pollen palynomorphs...|$|E
40|$|Nautakarjatiloilla rehuviljan tuotanto tapahtuu suhteellisen pienissä yksiköissä eikä se nykyisillä viljan hinnoilla ole kovin taloudellista. Lisäksi eräät viimeaikojen tukiratkaisut ovat hieman parantaneet nurmirehun asemaa viljaan verrattuna. Nautakarjatilojen puimuri-investoinneista päätellen omaa rehuviljaa tuotetaan jatkossa yhä harvemmalla tilalla. Aktiivitiloille tehdyn kyselyn perusteella vain yksi maitotila sadasta aikoo hankkia ajopuimurin lähivuosina. Myös yhä useampi viljelijä vähentää rehuviljan suhteellista alaa, luopuu rehuviljan viljelystä tai on epävarma koko tilan tulevaisuuden suhteen. Koska useilla nautakarjatiloilla tukiehtojen mukainen lannankäyttö koetaan ongelmaksi jo nyt, viljan jääminen pois viljelykierrosta vaikeuttaa tilannetta yhä enemmän. Nurmirehuntuotannossa keskeisimpiä ongelmia ovat nurmen uudistamisen, viljelykasvivalinnan ja lannankäytön yhteensovittaminen. Rehuviljaa korvaavaksi vaihtoehdoksi viljelykierrossa on esitetty kokoviljasäilörehua, jossa on mukana koko kasvusto eli jyvät, lehdet ja korsi. Tällä menetelmällä päästäisiin yhteen peltoviljelyn koneketjuun ja vältettäisiin rehuviljan puintiin ja kuivatukseen liittyvät työ- ja pääomakustannukset. Kokoviljasäilörehun viljelyä, tuotantotekniikkaa, ruokintavaikutuksia ja taloudellista kannattavuutta selvitetään usean tutkimuslaitoksen yhteistyönä. Selvitettävänä on, voidaanko nautakarjatiloilla perinteinen rehuviljanviljely korvata ja nurmet uudistaa viljakasvustolla, josta tietyssä kehitysvaiheessa tehdään säilörehua. Tyypillisillä maitotiloilla siirtyminen viherlinjaan muuttaa viljelykiertoa ja karjalannan käyttömahdollisuuksia. Kun rehuvilja ostetaan tilan ulkopuolelta, eläinmäärien ja nurmi- ja kokoviljarehun tuotannon sekä lannankäytön välille joudutaan hakemaan uusi ympäristönormit huomioon ottava tasapaino. This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the current state, problems and plans for the near future related to the cereal and grass production on cattle farms. Production has been examined {{on the basis of the}} proportional shares of cereal and grass fodder area as well as farmers intentions concerning changes in fodder production. The study also covers the current state and future prospects of farming, and it is based on mailed questionnaires directed at the farms participating in the profitability bookkeeping of the Agricultural Economics Research Institute in spring 1999 as well as DataLaari farm panel made by the Food Facts Ltd. in 1998. Both inquiries concern the situation after autumn 1998, i. e. following an exceptionally bad crop year. About half of the cattle farms plan to continue fodder production in the current extent and with the same proportional shares of grass and cereal fodder. The willingness to continue production is the highest on bookkeeping farms practising cattle husbandry, while farms that participated in the farm panel expressed more intentions related to changes in fodder production due to uncertainty or plans to quit production. In terms of the different parts of the country as well as active farms and the farm panel, the intentions to change fodder production deviate mainly for the part of Ostrobothnia, where uncertainty was more common and many farms refused to participate in the study. The planning of the fodder production is particularly difficult due to the uncertainty related to the EU membership as well as the Agenda 2000 process, which was underway when the inquiry was made. About half of the farms consider that Agenda 2000 will have no effect on their fodder production, but almost a fifth of all cattle farms were unable to estimate the future of their fodder production or did not answer the questions. About half of the bookkeeping farms practising cattle husbandry expects the efficiency of arable crop production to continue to decrease, and according to about a quarter the cereal area is going to fall as a result of Agenda 2000. Whole cereal, i. <b>e.</b> <b>cereals</b> where part of the straw and the whole ear is used as fodder, was cultivated for either green fodder or silage on about a quarter of dairy farms participating in the bookkeeping in 1999. On other cattle farms whole cereal was not produced at all. On dairy farms producing whole cereal the average area under this was a little over four hectares. The farms expressed no intentions to increase the area of whole cereal, and the introduction of whole cereal fodder was considered on very few of the farms where cattle husbandry was based on grass fodder only. The use of whole cereal fodder is examined in a joint project, primarily between the Agricultural Research Centre and Agricultural Economics Research Institute. An economic study will be published in the beginning of 2000 concerning the comparison of the milk production cost at the farm level between whole cereal and grass feeding. vokMTT Taloustutkimus MTT...|$|E
40|$|In Greece the {{reception}} and settlement of immigrants {{is a recent}} phenomenon. The {{majority of them are}} Albanians in origin and Ioannina prefecture is a preferable area because it is located next to Albania. Their children constist a new and growing segment of the child population in our country. There is a limited knowledge about the eating habits, the growth, the health status and the living conditions of the children of Albanian immigrants. The AIM of the study was the investigation of dietary habits and the estimation of growth of the Albanian schoolchildren who lived with their families at the Ioannina prefecture and the comparison with a sample of Greek schoolchildren living in the same area. Additional parameters that were examined were: dental health and care, parental knowledge on nutrition, leisure activities and living conditions of the study population. Children of immigrants were also evaluated the influence of time they stayed in Greece might have in the study parameters. POPULATION and METHODS. The study population consisted of a) the Albanian immigrants? children who attended primary schools at Ioannina prefecture during 1996 - 97 : group A, 283 children (149 males and 134 females) and b) a representative sample of Greek children (systematic sampling method) from the same primary schools: group E, 629 children (332 males and 297 females). The investigator visited primary schools (23 of which were located at Ioannina city and 13 were from outside villages) and a) she examined the children of the study: she measured body weight and height and evaluated the prevelance of dental caries and b) she handed out questionnaire for examine their dietary habits and additional parameters. The questionnaire was filled anonymously by the parents, returned to school and collected by the investigator. The Food Frequency Questionnaire method was used to study the dietary habits. The questionnaire consisted of 171 questions divided into 6 units: a) dietary habits, b) parental knowledge on nutrition, c) child health, d) leisure time-physical activity, e) living conditions and f) family. The evaluation of the duration of living in Greece in the study parametrs, was made by comparing Albanian children stayed ? 2 years (group A 1, n= 57 children) with those who stayed > 2 years (group A 2, n= 198 children) in Greece. RESULTS. The response rate to the questionnaire was 93. 6 % for the children of Albanian immigrants and 97. 3 % for the sample of Greek children. The mean age (SD) was 9. 5 (1. 8) years for group A and 9. 3 (1. 7) for group E. I. Comparison between children of Albanian immigrants (group A) and controls Greek children (group E).

(Hymenoptera: Apidea) and the small white Pieris rapae (L.) (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) were investigated in Spain. A database of more than 7, 000 records of the dates of the first spring sightings of each species in more than 700 localities from 1952 - 2004 was used. Phenological data were related to spatial, topographical, climate, land use, and vegetation productivity explanatory variables by means of multiple regression models in order {{to search for the}} environmental mechanisms underlying the observable phenological variability. Temperature and altitudinal spatial gradients accounted for most of the spatial variability in the phenology of the studied species, while vegetation productivity and land use had low relevance. In both species, the first individuals were recorded at those sites with warmer springs and dry summers, at low altitudes, and not covered with dry farming (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>cereal</b> crops). The identity and magnitude of the effect of the variables were almost identical for both species and closely mirrored spatial temperature gradients. The best explanatory models accounted for up to half of the variability of appearance dates. Residuals did not show a spatial autocorrelation, meaning that no other spatially structured variable at our working resolution could have improved the results. Differences in the spatial patterns of phenology with regard to other taxa, such as arrival dates of migratory birds, suggest that spatial constraints may play an essential role in the phenological matching between trophic levels.

40|$|Organic {{agriculture}} faces {{challenges to}} enhance food {{production per unit}} area and simultaneously reduce the environmental and climate impacts, e. g. nitrate leaching per unit area and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit mass produced. Eco-functional intensification is suggested as a means to reach these objectives. Eco-functional intensification involves activating more knowledge and refocusing the importance of ecosystem services in agriculture. Organic farmers manage agrobiodiversity by crop rotation (diversification in time). However, sole cropping (SC) of genetically identical plants in organic agriculture may limit resource use efficiency and yield per unit area. Intercropping (IC) of annual grain species, cultivar mixes, perennial grains, or forage species and forestry and annual crops (agroforestry) are examples of spatial crop diversification. Intercropping is based on eco-functional intensification and may enhance production by complementarity in resource use in time and space. Intercropping is based on the ecological principles of competition, facilitation and complementarity, which often increases the efficiency in acquisition and use of resources such as light, water and nutrients compared to sole crops, especially in low-input systems. Here we show that IC of cereals and grain legumes in European arable organic farming systems is an efficient tool for enhancing total grain yields compared to their respective sole crops. Simultaneously, we display how intercropping of cereals and legumes can be used as an efficient tool for weed management and to enhance product quality (i. <b>e.</b> <b>cereal</b> grain protein concentration). We discuss how intercropping contributes to efficient use of soil N sources and minimizes losses of N by nitrate leaching via Ecological Precision Farming. It is concluded that intercropping has a strong potential to increase yield and hereby reduce global climate impacts such as GHG/kg grain. Finally, we discuss likely barriers and lock-in effects for increased use of intercropping in organic farming and suggest a roadmap for innovation and implementation of IC strategies in organic agriculture...|$|R
40|$|Cropping pattern {{refers to}} the {{percentage}} of acreage occupied by various crops within the crop rotation. It is determined through cultivated' area assigned to each crop according to the sequence system necessitated by crop rotation considerations. The optimum crop pattern is the one, which achieves the highest possible net return depending on input and output prices together with crop yields. It is a dynamic process as it changes from time to another based on farmers' needs and crops profitability in the previous year. It also may differ based on whether we are looking {{from the point of}} view individual farmer, trader, middleman, and exporter or {{from the point of view}} the society as a whole. Various crops are competing on the limited land within the agricultural season. So expanding the acreage of any crop would automatically entail contraction of another competitive crop, as total supply of land is almost fixed and limited. The major objective behind designing an indicative cropping pattern is the issue of food security. This issue is important both from strategic perspective, as well as in the context of poverty. While there is emerging consensus on the definition of food security as aiming to assure the country adequate access to food, both internally and externally generated, there is still reference to the need to grow certain strategic crops. Moreover, there is a desire to achieve a measure of stabilization in producer and consumer prices through the development of buffer stocks. There are various options available, each of which has costs and benefits related to them. One option would be a high level of risk aversion, which would entail a cropping pattern that centers on subsistence crops. Another option may pursue efficiency pricing and therefore would result in crops being growing in which the country has a comparative advantage. For example, self-sufficiency for wheat could be enhanced to 75 % in an efficient manner. Meanwhile the domestic production of rice and sugar cane may expand to a frontier that misallocates resources of water and land. The agricultural production is very susceptible to risks originated from natural, economic or social fosters that are difficult to predict or control. In Egypt, cropping pattern, is influenced by local economic variables to up prices, i. e., cropped area is determined by farmer response to changes in absolute or relative prices of the preceding season, in addition to profitability of crops of the last season, where farmer can not change supply of labor, the elapse of period of time curding to the nature of the crops being produced. Egypt's cropping pattern is also affected by international variables related to transactions with international markets for food products and to transactions with international markets for food products and to problem related to world production of biological fuel, world financial crisis, world food crisis, and rules imposed by the international trade system. As a result, there is a deficit in the Egyptian balance of trade for food commodities amounting to L. E. 8 milliards on average for the last few years. The upsurge in demand for agricultural crops like wheat, maize, soybeans, vegetable, oils, and sugar crops for the use in producing biological fuel has resulted in a drastic increase in prices of food, during 2005 - 2007 the average rate of price increase of food commodities has been estimated at 83 % which led to a high increase in import bill in developing -and poor countries among them Egypt which is a not food importer. For many reasons developing an increase in domestic agricultural production of strategic food crops, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>cereals</b> legumes. Vegetable, oils, and sugar crops, is the best way to confront international variables, Either through vertical or horizontal expansion of those crops in addition to reducing the acreage of high water consuming scraps, which is the objective behind suggesting the cropping pattern in the short and long terms. Each of these objectives is direct by associated with the master end of ensuring food serenity. Indicative cropping pattern during last years varies considerably as compared to the actual cropping pattern experienced by farmers' decisions irrespective of the agricultural policy of the government Egypt. However, indicative or proposed cropping pattern could be put into action by introducing economic, institution and organization instruments. Those various instruments should be streamlined and harmonized together. Economic instruments advisable for execution of cropping pattern could include subsidizing production and inputs for strategic export and import crops that minimize consumption of irrigation water, introducing contractual agricultural production system, especially, in regard to cotton, sugar cane and sugar beet in addition to other industrial crops. It is advisable to establish agricultural stabilization funds to insure' farmers against various types of risks notably price risks. More over incentives either negative like taxes or positive like interest rate reduction, and rescheduling of debts could also be provided and operated. One major organizational instrument that has been successful recently introduced at a probation scale in three governorates is the national project for development of the field irrigation system in wade and delta. It is estimated that application of that project would save 15 % of water consumed for irrigation. The saved water could be used for ameliorating and reclaiming an estimated acreage of 3 million feddans. In addition it is suggested that elimination of camels and messages on the fields would save and area of 0. 5 million feddans to be put under cultivation. The study has estimated risk associated with Egyptian cropping pattern by application of linear and non-linear mathematical programming. Three models of minimization risk have been proposed and manipulated including: (1) Minimization Of Total Absolute Deviations: (MOTAD). (2) Risk Input-Output MOTAD. (3) Two Stage Stochastic Programming – (TSSP-RIO-MOTAD). In addition to the various scenarios cited above with their respective major objective functions, the models do comprise acreage, means of production in terms of cost of production, monthly year round irrigation water, and annual agricultural labor on monthly basis. Sensitivity analysis has been estimated for depicting the effect of changing prices of wheat and rice on cropping pattern disposition, by the application of TSSP-RIO-MOTAD model. Among the major results of these analyses are: 1 - An increment of gross margin to farmers at L. E 3. 8 milliard which deeps that suggested cropping has achieved the profit maximization goal which producers would aim at. 2 - A huge amount of irrigation water has been saved estimated at 2. 6 milliard cubic meters. A magnitude of water saved of this amount could be assigned for reclaiming new lands at about 0. 7 million feddans. 3 - Capital resources saved estimated at L. E. 985 million. 4 - Augmenting acreage under wheat to reach as much as 3 million feddans, which help contributing positives to the nation's food security goal. 5 - Reduction in rice acreage so as not to exceed one million feddan. Adding to the nations objectives of saving irrigation water to be used for reclamation of additional new lands. 6 - Augmenting acreage cultivated to Soya beans, sunflower, maize, and summer sorghum at 84. 9 %, 69. 5 %, 41 %, and 12. 3 % respectively, which, once again, contributes to the nation's objective related to enhancing food security. 7 - Augmenting areas under lentil, lupine, chickpeas, broad bean, and fenugreek by 111 %, 62. 2 %, 39. 5 %, 19. 8 %, and 8. 6 % respectively, which positively adds to food security objective. The proposed cropping pattern derived through sensitivity analysis and based on varying farm- prices for wheat and rice is heavily dependent on the effectiveness and synergy of mechanisms and instruments suggested for addressing and implementing of the indicative cropping pattern. Securing the accomplishment of maximization of farmer's profit margin are very major and essential objectives of the proposed cropping pattern. ...|$|E

In spite of a wealth of data on both B/CYDV and WDV pathosystems, little information is available processes related to (i) the emergence, spread and maintenance of these viruses in a landscape including cultivated and wild compartments and (ii) the interactions between these viral species and between their vectors. An intensive survey was conducted to collect plants and insects in a 5 km² landscape (Annoix, Cher, France) where B/CYDV and WDV, and their vectors (i. <b>e.</b> <b>cereal</b> aphids and Psammotettix alienus), are usually highly prevalent. Previously characterized and putative host species of the Poaceae family present in the visited areas were sampled.
