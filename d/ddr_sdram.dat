25|$|Double {{data rate}} {{synchronous}} {{dynamic random-access memory}} (<b>DDR</b> <b>SDRAM)</b> is a class of memory integrated circuits used in computers. <b>DDR</b> <b>SDRAM,</b> also called DDR1 SDRAM, has been superseded by DDR2 SDRAM, DDR3 SDRAM and DDR4 SDRAM. None of its successors are forward or backward compatible with DDR1 SDRAM, meaning DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4 memory modules will not work in DDR1-equipped motherboards, and vice versa.|$|E

The latter risk is particularly acute for Commercial-Off-The-Shelf components since high-performance parts (e. g. double-data-rate synchronous dynamic random access memories - <b>DDR</b> <b>SDRAMs)</b> may require other high-performance commercial parts (e. g. processors) to support their operation.

2500|$|Compared {{to single}} data rate (SDR) SDRAM, the <b>DDR</b> <b>SDRAM</b> {{interface}} makes higher transfer rates possible by more strict {{control of the}} timing of the electrical data and clock signals. Implementations often have to use schemes such as phase-locked loops and self-calibration to reach the required timing accuracy. The interface uses double pumping (transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal) to double data bus bandwidth without a corresponding increase in clock frequency. One advantage of keeping the clock frequency down is that it reduces the signal integrity requirements on the circuit board connecting the memory to the controller. The name [...] "double data rate" [...] refers to the fact that a <b>DDR</b> <b>SDRAM</b> with a certain clock frequency achieves nearly twice the bandwidth of a SDR SDRAM running at the same clock frequency, due to this double pumping.|$|E
