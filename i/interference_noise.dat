50|$|SINPO, {{acronym for}} signal, <b>interference,</b> <b>noise,</b> propagation, and overall, is a Signal Reporting Codes used to {{describe}} the quality of radio transmissions, especially in reception reports written by shortwave listeners. Each letter of the code stands for a specific factor of the signal, and each item is graded on a 1 to 5 scale (where 1 stands for nearly undetectable/severe/unusable and 5 for excellent/nil/extremely strong).|$|E
50|$|In {{telecommunication}} {{and radio}} communication, spread-spectrum techniques are methods {{by which a}} signal (e.g., an electrical, electromagnetic, or acoustic signal) generated with a particular bandwidth is deliberately spread in the frequency domain, resulting in a signal with a wider bandwidth. These techniques are used {{for a variety of}} reasons, including the establishment of secure communications, increasing resistance to natural <b>interference,</b> <b>noise</b> and jamming, to prevent detection, and to limit power flux density (e.g., in satellite down links).|$|E

30|$|In contrast, with RSMA, {{we take a}} {{different}} route and depart from the SDMA and NOMA literature and those two extremes of fully decode interference and treat <b>interference</b> as <b>noise.</b> We introduce a more general and powerful multiple access framework based on linearly precoded rate splitting (RS) at the transmitter and SIC at the receivers. This enables to decode part of the interference and treat the remaining part of the <b>interference</b> as <b>noise</b> [12]. This capability of RSMA to partially decode interference and partially treat <b>interference</b> as <b>noise</b> enables to softly bridge the two extreme strategies of fully treating <b>interference</b> as <b>noise</b> and fully decoding interference. This contrasts sharply with SDMA and NOMA that exclusively rely on the two extremes or a combination thereof.|$|R
50|$|A Driven Right Leg Circuit or DRL circuit is an {{electric}} circuit {{that is often}} added to biological signal amplifiers to reduce Common-mode interference. Biological signal amplifiers such as ECG (Electrocardiogram) EEG (Electroencephalogram) or EMG circuits measure very small electrical signals emitted by the body, often as small as several micro-volts (millionths of a volt). Unfortunately, the patient's body can also act as an antenna which picks up electromagnetic interference, especially 50/60 Hz noise from electrical power lines. This interference can obscure the biological signals, making them very hard to measure. Right Leg Driver circuitry is used to eliminate <b>interference</b> <b>noise</b> by actively canceling the interference.|$|E
50|$|The aim of {{improving}} system spectral efficiency {{is to use}} limited radio spectrum resources and radio network infrastructure as efficiently as possible. The objective of radio-resource management is typically to maximize the system spectral efficiency under constraint that the grade of service should be above a certain level. This involves covering a certain area and avoiding outage due to co-channel <b>interference,</b> <b>noise,</b> attenuation caused by long distances, fading caused by shadowing and multipath, Doppler shift {{and other forms of}} distortion. The grade of service is also affected by blocking due to admission control, scheduling starvation or inability to guarantee quality of service that is requested by the users.|$|E
50|$|The {{cost for}} {{deploying}} a wireless network is normally dominated by base station sites (real estate costs, planning, maintenance, distribution network, energy, etc.) and sometimes also by frequency license fees. The objective of radio resource management is therefore typically {{to maximize the}} system spectral efficiency in bit/s/Hz/area unit or Erlang/MHz/site, under some kind of user fairness constraint, for example, that the grade of service should be above a certain level. The latter involves covering a certain area and avoiding outage due to co-channel <b>interference,</b> <b>noise,</b> attenuation caused by path losses, fading caused by shadowing and multipath, Doppler shift {{and other forms of}} distortion. The grade of service is also affected by blocking due to admission control, scheduling starvation or inability to guarantee quality of service that is requested by the users.|$|E

30|$|As a {{takeaway}} message, {{we note that}} {{the ability of a}} wireless network architecture to partially decode interference and partially treat <b>interference</b> as <b>noise</b> can lead to enhanced throughput and QoS, increased robustness, and lowered complexity compared to alternatives that are forced to operate in the extreme regimes of fully treating <b>interference</b> as <b>noise</b> and fully decoding interference.|$|R

50|$|Cell {{service area}} may also vary due to {{interference}} from transmitting systems, {{both within and}} around that cell. This is true especially in CDMA based systems. The receiver requires a certain signal-to-noise ratio, and the transmitter should not send with too high transmission power in view to not cause interference with other transmitters. As the receiver {{moves away from the}} transmitter, the power received decreases, so the power control algorithm of the transmitter increases the power it transmits to restore the level of received power. As the <b>interference</b> (<b>noise)</b> rises above the received power from the transmitter, {{and the power of the}} transmitter cannot be increased any more, the signal becomes corrupted and eventually unusable. In CDMA-based systems, the effect of interference from other mobile transmitters in the same cell on coverage area is very marked and has a special name, cell breathing.|$|E
50|$|The {{album is}} {{a parody of}} stereo test and {{demonstration}} records, which were used by hi-fi enthusiasts to test {{the performance of their}} audio systems. All of the items recorded on the tape are comedy sketches; the majority of them are also functional car stereo tests. One sketch is an old-fashioned country music song of love lost, where the lyrics use tones that vary from 30 cycles per second (now known as the hertz) up to 15,000 cycles per second. Another sketch explains to the consumer how to playing a trick on passengers in the car by using the left and right, as well as front and back, speaker volume controls to make it appear that fart noises are emanating from one particular area inside the car. Other comedy sketches help determine if a unit is in phase or out of phase, and whether a system has good left-right separation. The effects of <b>interference</b> <b>noise</b> and poor reception on car stereos are also demonstrated in comic ways.|$|E
40|$|The Characteristics of the {{periodic}} fluctuation of the tubular centrifugal fan were calculated by the discrete vortex method. By using the results, the <b>interference</b> <b>noise</b> {{caused by the}} interaction between the blade of impeller and the inlet distortion flow was predicted. It was pointed out that the fluctuations of the relative velocity at the inlet of impeller and the circulation around the blade have almost the same influence on the <b>interference</b> <b>noise.</b> The noise source is gathered near {{the leading edge of the}} blade. So the coefficient is introduced to use the averaged value of pressure fluctuation over the blade instead of the distributed noise source. The coefficient of averaging and the chord-wise correlation length do not varied with the degree of the distortion of the inlet flow. The <b>interference</b> <b>noise</b> levels by the prediction give good agreement with those by experiments. The inlet distortion flow has to be decreased under 1 percent to reduce the <b>interference</b> <b>noise</b> level to the turbulent noise level...|$|E
30|$|Considering a multiple-input single-output {{broadcast}} channel, {{we develop}} a novel multiple access framework, called rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). RSMA {{is a more}} general and more powerful multiple access for downlink multi-antenna systems that contains SDMA and NOMA as special cases. RSMA relies on linearly precoded rate-splitting with SIC to decode part of the interference and treat the remaining part of the <b>interference</b> as <b>noise.</b> This capability of RSMA to partially decode interference and partially treat <b>interference</b> as <b>noise</b> enables to softly bridge the two extremes of fully decoding interference and treating <b>interference</b> as <b>noise</b> and provides room for rate and QoS enhancements and complexity reduction.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{introduces}} a methodology {{for the evaluation}} of the interfer-ence noise, caused by digital switching activity, in sensitive circuits of a mixed-digital-analog chip. The digital switching activity is mod-eled stochastically as functions defined on Markov chains. The actual interference signal is obtained through the modulation of this discrete stochastic signal with real current injection patterns stored a priori in a pre-characterized library. The <b>interference</b> <b>noise</b> results from the propagations of these continuous stochastic signals through the lin-ear network that models the chip power grid, substrate and relevant package parasitics. The <b>interference</b> <b>noise</b> power spectral density is computed by linear frequency-domain analysis.
