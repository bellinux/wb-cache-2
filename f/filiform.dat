5|$|The androecium {{consists}} of six stamens with <b>filiform</b> (thread like) filaments, which are fasciculate (in close bundles) and declinate or ascendent. The anthers are dorsifixed or versatile. In the gynaecium, the ovary is inferior and trilocular with pluriovulate locules. The style is <b>filiform,</b> and the stigma trifid. The fruit forms a trivalve capsule containing seeds which are dry, flattened, obliquely winged or irregularly discoid, hardly ever turgid, and globose (spherical) or subglobose, with a brown or black phytomelanous testa.|$|E
5|$|The ovary is {{inferior}} (below {{the floral}} parts) and trilocular (three chambered) {{and there is}} a pistil with a minutely three lobed stigma and <b>filiform</b> (thread like) style, which is often exserted (extending beyond the tube).|$|E
5|$|Arixeniina {{represents}} two genera, Arixenia and Xeniaria, with a {{total of}} five species in them. As with Hemimerina, they are blind and wingless, with <b>filiform</b> segmented cerci. Hemimerina are viviparous ectoparasites, preferring the fur of African rodents in either Cricetomys or Beamys genera. Hemimerina also has two genera, Hemimerus and Araeomerus, {{with a total}} of 11 species.|$|E
5|$|Leaves : Simple, entire (smooth and even), linear, oval to <b>filiform</b> (thread-like), {{mostly with}} {{parallel}} veins, but occasionally net-veined. They are alternate (single and alternating direction) and spiral, {{but may be}} whorled (three or more attached at one node, e.g. Lilium, Fritillaria), cauline (arranged along the aerial stem) or sheathed in a basal rosette. They are rarely petiolate (stem attached before apex), and lack stipules. The aerial stem is unbranched.|$|E
5|$|Mecoptera {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with long beaklike rostra, membranous wings and slender, elongated bodies. They have relatively simple mouthparts, {{with a long}} labium, long mandibles and fleshy palps, which resemble those of the more primitive true flies. Like many other insects, they possess compound eyes {{on the sides of}} their heads, and three ocelli on the top. The antennae are <b>filiform</b> (thread-shaped) and contain multiple segments.|$|E
5|$|The {{forewings}} {{are short}} oblong leathery plates {{used to cover}} the hindwings like the elytra of a beetle, rather than to fly. Most species have short and leather-like forewings with very thin hindwings, though species in the former suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina (epizoic species, sometimes considered as ectoparasites) are wingless and blind with <b>filiform</b> segmented cerci (today these are both included merely as families in the suborder Neodermaptera). The hindwing is a very thin membrane that expands like a fan, radiating from one point folded under the forewing. Even though most earwigs have wings and are capable of flight, they are rarely seen in flight. These wings are unique in venation and {{in the pattern of}} folding that requires the use of the cerci.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are {{a diverse}} group of {{primates}} in terms of morphology and physiology. Some lemurs, such as the sportive lemurs and indriids, have longer hind limbs than forelimbs, making them excellent leapers. Indriids also have a specialized digestive system for folivory, exhibiting enlarged salivary glands, a spacious stomach, and an elongated caecum (lower gut) that facilitates fermentation. The hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus trichotis) reportedly has a very long tongue, allowing it to feed on nectar. Likewise, the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) has a feathery brush-shaped tongue, also uniquely adapted to feed on nectar and pollen. The aye-aye has evolved some traits that are unique among primates, making it stand out among the lemurs. Such traits include continuously growing, rodent-like front teeth for gnawing through wood and hard seeds; a highly mobile, <b>filiform</b> (filament-shaped) middle finger for extracting food from tiny holes; large, bat-like ears for detecting hollow spaces within trees; and use of self-generated acoustical cues to forage.|$|E
25|$|The theraphosid {{subfamily}} Ornithoctoninae {{is defined}} by the following combination of characters. Presence of retrolateral scopula of <b>filiform</b> setae on the cheliceral base. a small row of larger <b>filiform</b> paddle setae retrolaterally ventro-basally in connection to the retrolateral cheliceral scopula. Arrangement of stridulatory spines prolaterally on maxilla. The character of retrolateral scopula of <b>filiform</b> setae on the cheliceral base is shared by the African subfamily Harpactirinae, but the Ornithoctoninae can be distinguished from the Harpactirinae by the geographic distribution range and the presence of the other characters mentioned, which are lacking in the Harpactirinae.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper surface}} of the tongue is covered in {{masticatory}} mucosa a type of oral mucosa which is of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. Embedded in this are numerous papillae that house the taste buds and their taste receptors. The lingual papillae consist of <b>filiform,</b> fungiform, vallate and foliate papillae. and only the <b>filiform</b> papillae are not associated with any taste buds.|$|E
25|$|Fissured tongue with atrophy of the <b>filiform</b> {{papillae}} and a lobulated, erythematous {{appearance of}} the tongue.|$|E

25|$|Diagnosis {{is usually}} {{made on the}} {{clinical}} appearance {{without the need for}} a tissue biopsy. However, when biopsies have been taken, the histologic appearance is one of marked elongation and hyperparakeratosis of the <b>filiform</b> papillae and numerous bacteria growing on the epithelial surface.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} usual <b>filiform</b> needle, other needle types include three-edged needles and the Nine Ancient Needles. Japanese acupuncturists use {{extremely}} thin needles that are used superficially, sometimes without penetrating the skin, and surrounded by a guide tube (a 17th-century invention adopted in China and the West). Korean acupuncture uses copper needles and has a greater focus on the hand.|$|E
25|$|Black hairy tongue (BHT, also termed lingua villosa nigra) {{refers to}} a {{condition}} of the tongue where the <b>filiform</b> papillae elongate with black or brown discoloration, giving a black and hairy appearance. The appearance may be alarming, but it is a harmless condition. Predisposing factors include smoking, xerostomia (dry mouth), soft diet, poor oral hygiene and certain medications. Management is by improving oral hygiene, especially scraping or brushing the tongue.|$|E
25|$|Fennel, Foeniculum vulgare, is a {{perennial}} herb. It is erect, glaucous green, and grows to heights {{of up to}} 2.5m, with hollow stems. The leaves grow up to 40cm long; they are finely dissected, with the ultimate segments <b>filiform</b> (threadlike), about 0.5mm wide. (Its leaves {{are similar to those}} of dill, but thinner.) The flowers are produced in terminal compound umbels 5–15cm wide, each umbel section having 20–50 tiny yellow flowers on short pedicels. The fruit is a dry seed from 4–10mm long, half as wide or less, and grooved.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause is}} uncertain, {{but it is}} thought to be caused by {{accumulation}} of epithelial squames and proliferation of chromogenic (i.e., color-producing) microorganisms. There may be an increase in keratin production or a decrease in normal desquamation (shedding of surface epithelial cells). Many people with BHT are heavy smokers. Other possible associated factors are poor oral hygiene, general debilitation, hyposalivation (i.e., decreased salivary flow rate), radiotherapy, overgrowth of fungal or bacterial organisms, and a soft diet. Occasionally, BHT may be caused by the use of antimicrobial medications (e.g., tetracyclines), or oxidizing mouthwashes or antacids. A soft diet may be involved as normally food has an abrasive action on the tongue, which keeps the <b>filiform</b> papillae short. Pellagra, a condition caused by a vitamin deficiency, may cause a thick greyish fur to develop on the dorsal tongue, along with other oral signs.|$|E
25|$|The New World {{screwworm}} fly shares many {{characteristics of}} the common house fly. When keying out a dipteran specimen, {{it is important to}} first note whether bristles on the meron are present or absent. All species in the family Calliphoridae have bristles on their merones, plumose arista, and well-developed calypters. Both C. macellaria and C. hominivorax are metallic green to bluish green in major coloration, with setae on the dorsal surface of the stem vein, orange gena, pale white anterior spiracles, <b>filiform</b> palps, and three black longitudinal stripes (vittae) on the notum of the thorax. The species C. macellaria has pale setulae on the fronto-orbital plate outside the row of frontal bristles, while C. hominivorax has dark setulae on the fronto-orbital plate outside the row of frontal bristles. The female C. macellaria has a yellowish basicosta while the female C. hominivorax has a brown basicosta. C. macellaria is 6–9mm in length. C. hominivorax is 8–10mm in length.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} small to minute, clavate, {{more or less}} tapering, {{greatest}} width well below the middle, always more than two-and-a-half times as long as wide, transparent when fresh to whitish when worn. The umbilicus is completely closed. The spire is produced, slightly tapering or sides at most subparallel, not convex. The apex is flattened, obtusely conical to mamillate. The shell has from five-and-a-half to just under six hardly convex whorls, that are superficially smooth but under high magnification with faint spiral sculpture and growth lines, growth lines turning to weak costulation behind the labrum. Sutures are somewhat impressed, fairly shallow, simple and <b>filiform.</b> The aperture is subovate, sometimes distinctly squarish at base, peristome slightly incrassate and reflected, aperture not or hardly obstructed by three-fold dentition: a small angular process (usually a mere swelling), somewhat distant from and therefore not connected with apex of labrum {{so that there is}} no sinus; opposite the angular denticle there is an upper labral process {{in the form of a}} thickening of the labrum, which process does not correspond to a depression behind the labrum; finally, a very faint thickening of the lower columella may be interpreted as a columellar process.|$|E
500|$|Antennae are {{prominent}} paired appendages that project forwards between the animal's eyes and {{consist of a}} number of segments. In the case of butterflies, their length varies from half the length of the forewing to three-quarters of the length of the forewing. The antennae of butterflies are either slender and knobbed at the tip and, {{in the case of the}} Hesperiidae, are hooked at the tip. [...] In some butterfly genera such as Libythea and Taractrothera the knob is hollowed underneath. Moth antennae are either <b>filiform</b> (thread-like), unipectinate (comb-like), bipectinate (feather-like), hooked, clubbed or thickened. Some moths have knobbed antennae akin to those of butterflies, including the families Castniidae, Neocastniidae and Euschemonidae.|$|E
500|$|The {{species is}} {{frequently}} confused with Coccomyces coronatus, which has inflated paraphyses, longer asci and ascospores, less regularly shaped apothecia, and rarely occurs on leaves of evergreens. It prefers to grow on well-rotted leaves, and is found predominantly in northern Europe and eastern North America. C.tumidus is somewhat similar in appearance, but distinguished {{in the field}} by round to ellipsoid apothecia. C.australis has [...] (rolled up with the tip in the center) rather than <b>filiform</b> paraphyses, larger asci and somewhat larger ascospores (150–180 by 14–16.5μm and 60–75 by 2.5–3μm, respectively). Another lookalike species that is morphological quite similar to C.dentatus is C.kinabaluensis, found in the Malaysian state of Sabah. However, the latter can be distinguished by the following characters: three- to four-sided ascocarps; ascospores with a single septum; and longer, wider asci measuring 110–135 by 10–14μm.|$|E
500|$|The layer {{covering}} the apothecia is about 30μm thick, {{and made of}} blackened (carbonized) cells measuring 5–6μm in diameter. At {{the base of the}} apothecia is carbonized supportive tissue about 5μm thick. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphal cells) are unbranched, threadlike (<b>filiform),</b> gradually enlarge to a width of 2.0μm at the tip, and have granular contents. The thin-walled cylindrical to club-shaped asci (spore-bearing cells) are on a short stalk, and measure 70–105 by 8–10μm; each ascus contains eight ascospores. Ascospores, which measure 45–65 by 3.0μm, have a thin but distinct sheath, and lack septa (cross-walls). Pycnidia (which appear before the apothecia mature) are intraepidermal, [...] (having the shape of a double-convex lens) in cross section, 0.1–0.3mm in diameter, and covered with a dark brown layer of cells. The phialides are arranged in a basal layer, and borne on short conidiophores. They are slender and subulate (tapering to a point), lack a collarette, and measure 5–10 by 2–2.5μm. The conidia are colorless, rod-shaped, lack septa, and have dimensions of 4–5 by 1.0μm.|$|E
500|$|Drosera regia {{plants are}} fairly large herbs that produce {{horizontal}} woody rhizomes and {{a crown of}} large, linear leaves up to [...] long and [...] wide. The leaves possess stalked glands (tentacles) on the upper surface of the lamina along nearly {{the entire length of}} the leaf. The leaves lack petioles and stipules, emerging by circinate vernation (uncurling) and tapering to a <b>filiform</b> point. The tentacles and the leaf itself are capable of responding to prey by bending toward insects trapped in the sticky mucilage produced by the glands. Leaves are even capable of folding over themselves several times. Each leaf can possess thousands of tentacles, which can aid in the retention of larger prey when combined with the leaf wrapping tightly around captured insects. In its native habitat, D.regia has been known to capture large beetles, moths and butterflies. Plants go dormant during the colder season and form a dormant bud, consisting of a tight cluster of short, immature leaves. Plants begin to break dormancy in mid-July with a typical growing season lasting from October to April, though this is variable and plants can continue growing year-round without dormancy. Individual leaves die back but remain attached to the short stem, clothing the bottom portion of the plant in the blackened dead leaves of former years.|$|E
2500|$|The plant's {{leaves are}} 2–4nbsp&cm. (0.8-1.5 in.) long, highly <b>filiform</b> (elongated and narrow), round in {{cross-section}} and tapering at the end. Young leaves are bright green and grow uprightly; as they age, they darken to a maroon (color) and droop. The leaf surface {{is covered with}} stalked mucilaginous glands along its entire length. These serve not only to attract and trap insect prey, but also allow the plant to [...] "hold on" [...] to neighboring structures for support.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tongue is}} covered with {{thousands}} of small bumps called papillae, which are {{visible to the naked}} eye. [...] Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds. The exception to this is the <b>filiform</b> papillae that do not contain taste buds. There are between 2000 and 5000 taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue. [...] Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat. Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells.|$|E
2500|$|Hairy tongue (lingua villosa) {{refers to}} a marked {{accumulation}} of keratin on the <b>filiform</b> papillae on the dorsal surface of the tongue, giving a hair-like appearance. Black tongue (lengua negra) {{refers to a}} black discoloration of the tongue, {{which may or may}} not be associated with hairy tongue. [...] However, the elongated papillae of hairy tongue usually develop discoloration due to growth of pigment producing bacteria and staining from food. Hence the term black hairy tongue, although hairy tongue may also be discolored yellow or brown. Transient, surface discoloration that is not associated with hairy tongue can be brushed off. Drug-induced black hairy tongue specifically refers to BHT that develops because of medication.|$|E
2500|$|They are sooty {{brown in}} color, with a darker dorsally and lighter ventrally. Individual hairs are white at the base, and silver at the tips. Their forearms are [...] long. They have moderately-furred interfemoral membranes, and their short tails only have three vertebrae. Their muzzles are elongated, and their tongues {{are long and}} tipped with <b>filiform</b> papillae. The tongue {{attaches}} at the posterior side of the sternum. Their nose-leafs are triangular and erect. The average mass is [...] Their ears are [...] long. Like other nectarivores, this species has reduced teeth, missing the third molar while the other two molars are weakly cusped. Loss of teeth and dental ridges indicates accurately that their diet does not necessitate biting and chewing.|$|E
2500|$|Taste in the {{gustatory}} {{system allows}} humans {{to distinguish between}} safe and harmful food, and to gauge foods’ nutritional value. Digestive enzymes in saliva begin to dissolve food into base chemicals that are washed over the papillae and detected as tastes by the taste buds. The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called papillae, which are {{visible to the naked}} eye. [...] Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds. The exception to this are the <b>filiform</b> papillae that do not contain taste buds. There are between 2000 and 5000 taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue. [...] Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat. Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells.|$|E
2500|$|The eggs of hedylid moths have {{an upright}} {{configuration}} and are variable in shape: in Macrosoma inermis they are particularly narrow and spindle-shaped resembling those of some Pieridae {{and in the}} case of M. tipulata they are more barrel-shaped, like certain Nymphalidae. The larvae resemble probably convergently those of Apaturinae. Adult hedylids resemble geometer moths. They share many morphological and genetic characteristics both with the superfamilies Papilionoidea and Hesperioidea. The abdomen is very long and slim, like many Neotropical butterflies of the subfamilies Ithomiinae and Heliconiinae, hence the name of one Macrosoma species [...] "heliconiaria". Unlike other butterflies however, the antennae are un-clubbed, but rather <b>filiform</b> or bipectinate. Unlike the family Geometridae, in which they had been placed by the geometer expert L.B.Prout, hedylids lack tympanic organs at the base of the abdomen, but have them on the wings (see under Behaviour). Unlike other butterflies, however, (except in the unique case of the remarkable Australian skipper butterfly Euschemon rafflesia whose males possess these structures), the single-spined frenulum, and retinaculum is not lost or reduced in males, except in three Macrosoma species where there is no functional wing coupling system; the retinaculum is always lost in females and the frenulum may be vestigial. The family have been fully catalogued and illustrated in an identification guide.|$|E
2500|$|Nepenthes leonardoi {{is known}} to flower both in the rosette stage and as a vining plant. The species has a racemose inflorescence. Male inflorescences can reach a height of 50cm, of which the rachis {{constitutes}} up to 30cm. Female inflorescences are similar in size, typically growing to 45cm in length. Generally {{both male and female}} inflorescences are much shorter, however, {{especially in the case of}} plants growing in exposed sites. This being the case, exceptional specimens (also found in exposed areas) may produce a rigid inflorescence up to 110cm length, of which only the distal 15% bears flowers. Inflorescences of both sexes have a basal diameter of approximately 1cm and hold up to around 120 closely packed flowers, which are usually restricted to the distal quarter to half of its length. Flowers are usually borne on one-flowered pedicels, although two-flowered partial peduncles may also be present. The inflorescence often bears a vestigial leaf below the rachis. Male flowers are fragrant; their scent has been described as [...] "distinctive, musty, sweet" [...] and is noticeable from a distance of up to 60cm. The smell of female flowers has not been recorded. Fruits are up to 8mm long. As in most Nepenthes species, the seeds are <b>filiform.</b> They are pale brown and around 7mm long.|$|E
2500|$|All {{species are}} known from compression-impression fossils {{preserved}} in layers of soft sedimentary rock. [...] Many {{of the species}} are known only from isolated fore or hind wings, though full bodies are known for some species. [...] Species are typified by bodies that are over [...] long when known and covered in dense layers of setae. [...] The antennae are generally not longer than {{the length of the}} fore wings and have a simple <b>filiform</b> structure. [...] There is variation in the mouthparts, which commonly are [...] long siphon shaped proboscis, but some basal species have more distinct mandibles. [...] The proboscis is formed from the same mouth parts as those of Nymphalidae butterflies and were used for probing and sucking. [...] Species of at least one genus, Oregramma, have elongated lance shaped ovipositors. [...] The wings are distinctly large, over [...] long, often with centrally placed eye spots and the ovoid to triangular wings have numerous closely spaced branching veins. [...] Most of the species also have distinctly developed wing scales, a feature seen in Lepidopterans. [...] Two types of scales are seen in the kalligrammatids, shorter scales with a broad base that taper to a tip, and longer narrow scales with a spatulate shape. [...] The species Makarkinia adamsi has the longest wingspan of any neuropteran species, estimated at [...]|$|E
60|$|Peduncle, narrower, but {{generally}} {{longer than the}} capitulum; upper part encased with small calcareous scales, with their apices curved inwards, and overlapping each other. The inner surface of each scale is triangular, with the basal margin protuberant. The scales continue to grow or be added to, only in about the ten upper whorls, which form but {{a small part of}} the whole peduncle; in the lower part, the scales become further and further separated from each other. The surface of attachment, in full-grown specimens, is broad; but in two very young specimens, which I removed with great care after the action of potash, I found the peduncle ending in a <b>filiform</b> prolongation, such as often occurs in Scalpellum vulgare and in Lepas fascicularis. At the extremity of the pointed peduncle, there were seated the larval prehensile antennæ, of which the following measurements are given to show how minute they are.|$|E
60|$|Messrs. V. Thompson, Goodsir, and Bate, {{have kept}} alive {{for several days}} the larvæ of Lepas, Conchoderma, Balanus, Verruca, and Chthamalus, and have {{described}} the changes which supervene {{between the first and}} third exuviations. The most conspicuous new character is the great elongation of the posterior point of the carapace into an almost <b>filiform,</b> spinose point in Lepas, Conchoderma, Chthamalus, and Balanus, but not according to Goodsir, in one of the species of the latter genus. The posterior point, also, of the abdomen becomes developed in Balanus (Goodsir) into two very long, spear-like processes, serrated on their outer sides; in Lepas and Conchoderma, according to Thompson, into a single, tapering spinose projection; and in Chthamalus, as figured by Mr. Bate, the posterior bifid point, as well as the depending ventral fork, increase much in size. Another important change, which has been particularly attended to by Mr. Bate, is the appearance of spinose projections and spines (some of which are thick, curved, and strongly plumose, or, almost pectinated along their inner sides) on the pedicels and lower segments of the shorter rami of the two posterior pairs of limbs.|$|E
60|$|It is notorious, and {{we shall}} {{immediately}} adduce proofs, that increased use or action strengthens muscles, glands, sense-organs, etc.; and that disuse, on the other hand, weakens them. It has been experimentally proved by Ranke (24/12. 'Die Blutvertheilung, etc. der Organe' 1871 as quoted by Jaeger 'In Sachen Darwin's' 1874 page 48. See also H. Spencer 'The Principles of Biology' volume 2 1866 chapters 3-5.) that {{the flow of blood}} is greatly increased towards any part which is performing work, and sinks again when the part is at rest. Consequently, if the work is frequent, the vessels increase in size and the part is better nourished. Paget (24/13. 'Lectures on Pathology' 1853 volume 1 page 71.) also accounts for the long, thick, dark-coloured hairs which occasionally grow, even in young children, near old-standing inflamed surfaces or fractured bones by an increased flow of blood to the part. When Hunter inserted the spur of a cock into the comb, which is well supplied with blood-vessels, it grew in one case spirally to a length of six inches, and in another case forward, like a horn, so that the bird could not touch the ground with its beak. According to the interesting observations of M. Sedillot (24/14. 'Comptes Rendus' September 26, 1864 page 539.), when a portion of one of the bones of the leg of an animal is removed, the associated bone enlarges till it attains a bulk equal to that of the two bones, of which it has to perform the functions. This is best exhibited in dogs in which the tibia has been removed; the companion bone, which is naturally almost <b>filiform</b> and not one-fifth the size of the other, soon acquires a size equal to or greater than that of the tibia. Now, it is at first difficult to believe that increased weight acting on a straight bone could, by alternately increasing and diminishing the pressure, cause the blood to flow more freely in the vessels which permeate the periosteum and thus supply more nutriment to the bone. Nevertheless the observations adduced by Mr. Spencer (24/15. H. Spencer 'The Principles of Biology' volume 2 page 243.), on the strengthening of the bowed bones of rickety children, along their concave sides, leads to the belief that this is possible.|$|E
