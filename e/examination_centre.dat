2500|$|On {{their own}} initiative, Arthur Carford, who had gained {{employment}} as an orderly at the Medical <b>Examination</b> <b>Centre,</b> where potential conscripts fitness was reviewed, {{and three other}} members from Sheffield attempted to steal cards to exempt the bearer from military service for medical reasons. The four were arrested and charged at Sheffield Magistrates Court with [...] "stealing, receiving, conspiring to steal and conspiring to receive these cards, to which later was added a fifth charge of doing those acts [...] "with intent to assist the enemy". Realising the seriousness of these charges (especially the fifth charge which carried a charge of 20 years imprisonment), one of the defendants, Fred Jackson, defended himself arguing that {{by virtue of the}} political ideals it was impossible for Trotskyists to do anything deliberately to assist Nazi Germany, leading to no guilty verdicts on the fifth charge. He was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment, with Carford receiving 18 months, however, given the irresponsibility of their initial action they were barred from holding office within the WIL for a year and reduced to supporter status respectively. Of the other two defendants, Ward received 6 months and Beet was acquitted, but as both had given statements to the police that could have implicated the WIL they were expelled.|$|E
