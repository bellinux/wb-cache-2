40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study into the {{performance}} of currency-hedged portfolios constructed using mean-variance optimization methods. The method is to carry out optimization relative to a benchmark portfolio, which consists of the real assets, and simultaneously to determine the optimal exposures to each currency future. This is done at various levels of risk along the efficient frontier. A study into a portfolio of international stock and bond indices viewed from a US Dollar perspective indicates that, for the period studied, optimal currency hedging {{has the potential to}} add value in terms of additional expected return and excess return on a risk-adjusted basis. The results also demonstrate the superiority of strategies in which the hedge ratio is optimally determined over those with a <b>fixed</b> <b>hedge</b> ratio (JEL G 11) ...|$|E
40|$|Hedge fund {{managers}} differ in ability and investors want to distinguish good ones from bad. Via {{the design of}} their investment strategies, better {{fund managers}} want to ease this inference problem while worse fund managers want to complicate it. We impose only the minimal restrictions on the nature the investment strategies that, on average, returns reflect the hedge fund manager's ability and that returns be bounded from below, and solve for the set of equilibria that emerge. We then show that {{under a variety of}} equilibrium refinements, a unique equilibrium obtains. In this equilibrium, investors set a cutoff standard for providing capital to a hedge fund: and invest if and only if returns exceed this cutoff. This induces less able hedge fund managers to adopt risky investment strategies that maximize the probability of meeting this cutoff by risking large losses if they fail. Over time, as investors learn about a hedge fund manager's ability and less able hedge fund managers are stochastically weeded out, investors set less demanding re-investment standards. Our economy reconciles many facts regarding hedge fund performance. For example, in a regression with <b>fixed</b> <b>hedge</b> fund manager effects, returns of more experienced hedge fund managers decline, even though the expected profits of investors rise with the hedge fund manager's experience; more experienced hedge funds deliver less volatile returns; persistence of returns is greater for better hedge funds; hedge fund failure rates are initially very high, but fall sharply with hedge fund manager experience; returns of exiting hedge funds are substantially worse than historical returns; and the longer is an investor's horizon, the lower is the expected return of the hedge funds in which he invests...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how an institution might optimally manage the market risk of a given exposure. We provide an analytical approach to optimal risk management under the assumption that the institution wishes to minimize its Value-at-Risk (VaR) using options follows a geometric Brownian. The optimal solution specifies the VaR-minimizing level of moneyness of the option {{as a function of the}} asset's distribution, the risk-free rate, and the VaR hedging period. We find that the optimal strike of the put is independent of the level of expense the institution is willing to incur for its hedging program. The costs associated with a suboptimal choice of exercise price, in terms of either the increased VaR for a <b>fixed</b> <b>hedging</b> cost or the increased cost to achieve a given VaR, are economically significant. Comparative static results show that the optimal strike price of these options is increasing in the asset's drift, decreasing in its volatility for most reasonable parameterizations, decreasing in the risk-free interest rate, nonmonotonic in the horizon of the hedge, and increasing in the level of protection desired by the institution (i. e., the percentage of the distribution relevant for the VaR). We show that the most important determinant is the conditional distribution of the underlying asset exposure; therefore, the optimal exercise price is very sensitive to the relative magnitude of the drift and diffusion of this exposure. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY The {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyze the profitability of a specific fixed income trading strategy in the U. S. Treasury market. The strategy in question, riding the yield curve, {{is based on the}} assumption that the strong form of the rational expectations hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates (REHTS) does not hold. In addition, the thesis assesses whether different filter rules can enhance the performance of the strategy. This part of the study is motivated by previous studies documenting violations of the REHTS, as well as the inconclusive findings on the profitability of riding the yield curve. The second {{objective of}} the study is to scrutinize whether the returns from riding the yield curve explain <b>fixed</b> income <b>hedge</b> fund returns. The motivation for this part of the study stems from the findings of previous studies that <b>fixed</b> income <b>hedge</b> funds engage in risk arbitrage. Since hedge funds are often considered to be lacking in transparency, this thesis aims to extend previous literature by shedding light on the relatively little-known investment strategies of <b>fixed</b> income <b>hedge</b> funds. DATA AND METHODOLOGY The study utilizes interest rate data consisting of the U. S. Treasury data spanning from June 1961 through June 2010. The hedge fund data consists of hedge fund index data as well as data relating to a particular risk factor model. The sample period for the hedge fund data spans from January 1994 to September 2009. The ex post excess returns from riding the yield curve are calculated for trading strategies of various holding periods and maturities of the riding instrument, and the attractiveness of these strategies is assessed on a risk-adjusted basis by using the Sharpe ratio. Moreover, performance of the filter rules is analyzed in the context of riding the yield curve. Lastly, hedge fund index returns are regressed on a risk factor model amended with the returns from riding the yield curve. RESULTS The main findings of the thesis are summarized in the following: firstly, it is found that riding the yield curve strategies have generally outperformed the buy-and-hold strategies over equal maturities; in other words, REHTS is clearly violated. The performance of the riding strategies has changed markedly over decades, and it is strongly linked to the prevailing interest rate environment. Secondly, it is found that the filter rules do not enhance the performance of the riding strategies. Thirdly, no positive relationship between riding returns and hedge fund returns is found. In conclusion, this study finds no evidence that the yield curve speculators would consistently ride the yield curve, although the ex post excess riding returns have on average been positive in the period under scrutiny...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the risk characteristics for various hedge fund strategies specializing in fixed income instruments.

The hedge fired indices have a very strong exposure to high-yield credit. In general, we find a marginal benefit to using the nonlinear risk factors in terms of the ability to explain reported returns. Finally examine tile benefit of using various factor structures for estimating the value at risk of the hedge funds. We find that for some of the hedge fund strategies, downside risk estimates can be quite substantial. 16 page(s...|$|R

We find that the strategies requiring more “intellectual capital” to implement tend to produce significant alphas after controlling for bond and equity market risk factors. We show that the risk-adjusted excess returns from these strategies are related to capital flows into <b>fixed</b> income arbitrage <b>hedge</b> funds. In contrast with other hedge fund strategies, we find that many of the fixed income arbitrage strategies produce positively skewed returns. These results suggest that there may be more economic substance to fixed income arbitrage than simply “picking up nickels in front of a steamroller. ...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} {{explicit}} expressions for consumption and portfolio rules {{by applying the}} duality approach. Due to the optimal consumption process, we have to separate the wealth into three regions as in Koo et al. [5] and Rho et al. [8]. In the third region, where the wealth level is above the bliss level, the optimal consumption stays constant as its maximum so the value function is also fixed. To make the value function constant, {{there should be no}} risky asset investment. This fact is well-described in Koo et al. [5] and Rho et al. [8]. In the presence of inflation risk, however, even though the value function in the third region is still constant, the optimal investment in an inflation-linked index bond is not <b>fixed.</b> To <b>hedge</b> the inflation risk, all the financial wealth is invested in an inflation-linked index bond and investment in other assets becomes zero in the third region. When the wealth level is below the bliss level, the role of inflation-linked index bond can be different according to market parameters. In particular, for sufficiently large growth rate of the price process, the demand for speculative motive is reflected only on the inflation-linked index bond. For a small growth rate of the price process, however, the demand for speculative motive is distributed into both portfolios of inflation-linked index bond and the risky asset.|$|R
40|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{literature on the}} valuation of a fixed income contracts. The present work addresses the problem from a new outlook: we find {{upper and lower bounds}} for the value of a contract. Constraints are imposed on the evolution of a short-term interest rate and a liability is valued using its present value. A firstorder non-linear hyperbolic partial differential equation is formulated for the value, V, of the contract. The numerical solution of this equation is then explored. To optimise its value, our contract is hedged with market traded zero-coupon bonds. We can then generate the `Yield Envelope' (an alternative to the yield curve). At a maturity for which there are no traded instruments, a spread for the yield is obtained. A program implementing our model can be downloaded by clicking here.

40|$|We explore {{strategic}} {{trade in}} short-lived securities by agents who possess long-term information. Trading short-lived securities is profitable only if {{enough of the}} private information becomes public prior to contract expiration; otherwise the security will worthlessly expire. We highlight how this results in trading behavior fundamentally different from that observed in standard models of informed trading in equity. Specifically, we show that informed agents are more reluctant to trade shorter-term securities too far in advance of when their information will necessarily be made public, and that existing positions in a shorter-term security make future purchases more attractive. Because informed agents prefer longer-term securities, this can make trading shorter-term contracts more attractive for liquidity traders. We characterize {{the conditions under which}} liquidity traders choose to incur extra costs to roll over short-term positions rather than trade in distant contracts, providing an explanation for why most longer-term derivative security markets have little liquidity and large bid-ask spreads.

40|$|Cost-of-service is {{the typical}} {{regulatory}} scheme used {{for natural gas}} local distribution companies (LDCs). The profit of a regulated LDC is a return on investment, based on the capital she owns. The cost paid by consumers is, in general, equal to the cost incurred by the LDC for gas procurement including risk management, plus the return on investment. Major problems with such a scheme arise when natural gas prices are very volatile: (i) The LDC has little incentive to efficiently reduce her procurement cost, (ii) the cost of procurement by the LDC can vary substantially depending on her risk management strategy, (iii) and, the regulator {{does not know what}} the adequate cost should be and can rarely argue that the LDC is run inefficiently. ^ This work proposes the use of simulation benchmarks in incentive contracts for LDC regulation. Simulation benchmarks are costs associated with feasible LDC policies that incorporate natural gas price dynamics, using public information, and are based on particular properties of an LDC. These benchmarks can serve as a basis of comparison for a regulator who aims to reduce a trade-off between expectation and variance of the cost paid by consumers. ^ We propose a mean-variance framework to study the behavior of linear incentive contracts using simulation benchmarks. The analysis suggests that the regulator should select a benchmark on the efficient frontier of benchmarks that reflects his risk preference. Two families of simulation benchmarks are designed based on two types of policies, namely: optimization policies and <b>fixed</b> fraction <b>hedging</b> policies. An experimental implementation illustrates how an efficient frontier of benchmarks can be constructed and compares the performance of various simulation benchmarks. ...|$|R

40|$|Fuel price {{volatility}} {{is a major}} concern for airlines. An unexpected spike in fuel prices can keep an airline from profiting, and higher fares due to higher fuel prices can diminish customer demand. Airlines that hedge large portions of their future fuel needs at one time risk being <b>fixed</b> in their <b>hedges</b> if spot fuel prices drop. Airlines that do not hedge at all take an even greater risk as there is no 100 % assurance to forecast future fuel expenditures. Using market indicators, a model for selective fuel hedging might prove successful in offsetting fuel {{price volatility}}. Two models for selective fuel hedging based on trend lines, the fast stochastic oscillator, and two different stop-loss measures showed profitability in each year of a four year historical trading simulation. The simulation resulted with the 2 % stop-loss model potentially saving an airline or other aviation fuel users an average of $ 0. 47 per gallon per year (based on a 100, 000 gallon per year usage) from October 2007 through September 2011, and the 5 % stop-loss model saving an average of $ 0. 65 per gallon per year (based on a 100, 000 gallon per year usage) during the same time period.

Chile {{is the home}} country of the representative investor, but results are likely to hold more generally. The problem is set up as in (Sharpe & Tint, 1990) and (Hoevenaars et al., 2007). Hedging the liabilities and the consumption currency may imply optimal close-to-home biases, defined as overweighting asset classes which are highly correlated with local ones. The implementation challenges include: developing a methodology to estimate expected returns in local (real) currency; estimating the covariance matrix allowing for serial and crossed-serial correlations; and checking the results' robustness using a resampling method. The findings are: (i) portfolios always have optimal close-to-home biases, beyond the investment in local <b>fixed</b> income to <b>hedge</b> liabilities; (ii) currency hedging reduces investment in close-to-home asset classes, (iii) but has ambiguous effects on welfare [...] detected with the resampling method; (iv) currency hedged long-term US bonds are useful for hedging local interest rate risk; and (v) liabilities give access to high risk-return portfolios, not affecting otherwise the overall shape of the efficient regions.
