The following day, the king was brought before a public session of the commission, declared guilty and sentenced. Fifty-nine of the commissioners signed Charles's <b>death</b> <b>warrant.</b>|$|E
5|$|The six {{judges of}} the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled {{unanimously}} that all {{issues raised by}} Abu-Jamal, including the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, were without merit. The Supreme Court of the United States denied a petition for certiorari against that decision on October 4, 1999, enabling Ridge to sign a second <b>death</b> <b>warrant</b> on October 13, 1999. Its execution in turn was stayed as Abu-Jamal commenced his pursuit of federal habeas corpus review.|$|E
5|$|Leicester having {{returned}} to England, in February 1587 Elizabeth signed Mary's <b>death</b> <b>warrant,</b> {{with the proviso}} that it be not carried out until she gave her approval. As {{there was no sign of}} her doing so, Burghley, Leicester, and a handful of other privy councillors decided to proceed with Mary's execution in the interest of the state. Leicester went to Bath and Bristol for his health; unlike the other privy councillors involved, he escaped Elizabeth's severe wrath on hearing the news of Mary's death.|$|E
5000|$|Casey {{would be}} forced to sign two <b>death</b> <b>warrants</b> after May 1991, after a lawsuit was brought by Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli.

5000|$|During 1933-1945, Wehrmacht courts issued, {{conservatively}} estimated, 25000 <b>death</b> <b>warrants,</b> {{of which}} 18000 to 20000 were executed." [...] According to official statistics, other courts had altogether issued 16560 <b>death</b> <b>warrants</b> (whereof 664 before the war), of which about 12000 were executed.

5|$|On November 8, 2004, Fletcher {{signed a}} <b>death</b> <b>warrant</b> for Thomas Clyde Bowling, {{who was convicted}} of a double murder in 1990 and sentenced to death by lethal injection. A group of doctors {{requested}} an investigation by the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure to determine whether Fletcher's medical license should be revoked for that action. Kentucky requires doctors to follow the guidelines of the American Medical Association, which forbid doctors from participating in an execution. On January 13, 2005, the Board of Medical Licensure found that Fletcher was acting in his capacity as governor, not as a doctor, when he signed the warrant and ruled that his license was not subject to forfeiture by that action.|$|E
5|$|Nasib al-Bakri (1888–1966) was a Syrian {{politician}} and nationalist {{leader in the}} first half of the 20th century. He played a major role in establishing al-Fatat, an underground organization which sought the independence and unity of the Ottoman Empire's Arab territories. As the chief envoy between al-Fatat and the Hejaz-based Hashemites, al-Bakri became a close aide to Emir Faisal when the latter became King of Syria following the success of the 1916 Arab Revolt. Al-Bakri opposed the establishment of the French Mandate of Syria and became one of the chief commanders of the Great Syrian Revolt, leading the rebels' brief capture of Damascus. He escaped a <b>death</b> <b>warrant</b> in Syria in 1927, but returned the following year after being amnestied.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, 2011the {{day before}} Chandler's 65th birthdayFlorida Governor Rick Scott signed Chandler's <b>death</b> <b>warrant.</b> His {{execution}} {{was set for}} November 15, 2011, at 4:00pm. His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He is not going to make a scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that I can find to try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E

5|$|Temple gained {{military}} {{experience as a}} member of the Duke of Buckingham's expedition to the Isle of Ré in 1627. As a puritan, he joined the Parliamentary army at the outbreak of the Civil War and fought at the Battle of Edgehill. He rose to become a colonel and commanded Tilbury Fort, an important defensive position on the approach to London by river. He was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Bramber in September 1645 to replace an ejected Royalist. He sided with the army in opposing any compromise with the King, and was appointed as a judge at the trial of King Charles I of England. Temple attended most of the court sessions and was the 28th (of 59) to sign the King's <b>death</b> <b>warrant.</b> After the restoration of Charles II, he was convicted of regicide, but avoided execution and was imprisoned on Jersey, where he died.|$|E
5|$|The Blagrave {{family were}} wealthy landowners around Reading, and the manor passed {{down through the}} family (which {{included}} mathematician John Blagrave, who built a new house at Southcote); a lease document dated from 1596 suggests that the manor was divided between three Blagrave brothers. Daniel Blagrave, a cousin of John, inherited the manor on the latter's death in 1611. At {{the time of the}} English Civil War, during the Siege of Reading in 1643, the Blagraves allowed Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex to use the manor as his headquarters. The Blagrave family, who were sympathetic to the Roundheads, are said to have hosted Oliver Cromwell, John Hampden and Robert Blake for a council of war in one of the house's oak panelled rooms. In January 1649, Daniel was one of the signatories of Charles I's <b>death</b> <b>warrant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona {{maintained}} {{the tradition of}} ruling {{with the support of}} advisers drawn largely from the aristocratic class. The queen's most powerful ministers were also her consorts. Her first chief adviser was a young army officer from Namehana named Andriamihaja, who served as First Minister from 1829 to 1830. Major-General Andriamihaja most likely fathered the queen's only son, Prince Rakoto (later King Radama II), who was born eleven months {{after the death of his}} official father, King Radama I. In the early years of Ranavalona's reign, Andriamihaja was the leader of her court's progressive faction, who favored maintaining the relations with Europe initiated under Radama. The conservative faction was led by the brothers Rainimaharo and Rainiharo, the latter being the official guardian of one of the most powerful royal sampy. These talismans were believed to embody and channel the supernatural powers of the kingship and had played a major role in the spiritual life of the Merina people since at least the 16th century reign of Ralambo. The conservative faction conspired to reduce Andriamahaja's progressive influence over the queen, and in September 1830 they managed to persuade her while highly intoxicated to sign his <b>death</b> <b>warrant</b> for charges of witchcraft and treason. He was immediately captured in his home and killed.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the right}} to abolish death penalty is held by the Legislative Yuan which is {{currently}} dominated by the opposing Pan-blue coalition, {{as well as being}} more conservative on this issue, the Democratic Progressive Party government forced a moratorium by not signing <b>death</b> <b>warrants</b> except for serious and noncontroversial cases. As a result, the number of executions dropped significantly from 2002. In an October 2006 interview, Chen Ding-nan's successor Shih Mao-lin (施茂林) said he would not sign any <b>death</b> <b>warrants</b> for the 19 defendants who had already been sentenced to death by the Supreme Court, because their cases were still being reviewed inside the Ministry.These conditions remained in effect until Chen Shui-bian's tenure expired on May 20, 2008.|$|R

5000|$|In September 2009, Frank {{moved to}} have Judge Marullo removed from her ongoing post-conviction appeals {{on grounds of}} bias, given that he had already signed two <b>death</b> <b>warrants</b> for her. Louisiana state Judge Laurie White heard the motion in September 2009 and on January 3, 2010 ruled that Marullo {{should not be taken}} off the case. Her {{attorney}} stated she would appeal the ruling to the state supreme court, which had already overruled both of Marullo's <b>death</b> <b>warrants.</b> [...] However, yet another lower court state judge, ruled in October 2010 that Marullo had to be recused from the Frank and Lacaze cases because it was unclear if he had been open with the defense teams about his own surprising connection to the gun used in the restaurant murders. Marullo's signature appeared on an order authorizing Frank to take the murder weapon from the evidence room; Marullo has long maintained the signature was forged. No female has been executed by the State of Louisiana since 1942.|$|R
25|$|Major-General Thomas Harrison (1606 – 1660) {{sided with}} Parliament in the English Civil War. In 1649 {{he signed the}} <b>death</b> <b>warrant</b> of Charles I and in 1660, shortly after the Restoration, he {{was found guilty of}} {{regicide}} and hanged, drawn and quartered.|$|E

2500|$|Yates {{remains on}} death row at the Washington State Penitentiary. [...] His case has been further {{complicated}} by Washington Governor Jay Inslee's 2013 declaration {{that he would not}} sign <b>death</b> <b>warrants</b> for anyone {{on death row}} while he is in office. [...] Inslee cited the high cost of the appeals process, the randomness with which death sentences are sought, and a lack of evidence that the penalty serves as a deterrent to other criminals.|$|R
50|$|In 1934 the Assembly {{voted to}} amend civil and {{military}} penal codes. One {{of the proposed}} changes would allow death sentences {{to be carried out}} without the king's approval. The king protested, and in two letters submitted to the Assembly said that ending this time-honoured custom would make the people think that the government desired the right to sign <b>death</b> <b>warrants</b> to eliminate political opponents. As a compromise he proposed holding a national referendum on the issue.|$|R

50|$|The vicereine Germaine of Foix brutally {{repressed}} {{the uprising}} and its leaders, and this accelerated the authoritarian centralisation {{of the government}} of Charles I.

The King delayed signing the <b>death</b> <b>warrants</b> and automatically prevented the execution to take place, because {{at that time the}} Penal Code required a written royal consent before the executions could take place.|$|R
