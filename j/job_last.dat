I don't know how long he expected us to be stuck on the riverside outskirts of Rouen, but I know that the cables got hauled up and turned end for end according to my satanic suggestion, put down again, and their very existence utterly forgotten, I believe, before a French river pilot came on board to take our ship down, empty as she came, into the Havre roads. You may think that this state of forced idleness favoured some advance in the fortunes of Almayer and his daughter. Yet it was not so. As if it were some sort of evil spell, my banjoist cabin-mate's interruption, as related above, had arrested them short {{at the point of}} that fateful sunset for many weeks together. It was always thus with this book, begun in '89 and finished in '94--with that shortest of all the novels which it was to be my lot to write. Between its opening exclamation calling Almayer to his dinner in his wife's voice and Abdullah's (his enemy) mental reference to the God of Islam--"The Merciful, the Compassionate"--which closes the book, there were to come several long sea passages, a visit (to use the elevated phraseology suitable to the occasion) to the scenes (some of them) of my childhood and the realisation of childhood's vain words, expressing a light-hearted and romantic whim.|$|E

6000|$|Last night, {{about four}} o'clock, Belle and I {{set off to}} Apia, whither my mother had preceded us. She was at the Mission; we went to Haggard's. There {{we had to wait}} the most unconscionable time for dinner. I do not wish to speak lightly of the Amanuensis, who is unavoidably present, but I may at least say for myself that I was as cross as two sticks. Dinner came at last, we had the tinned soup which is usually the pièce de {{resistance}} in the halls of Haggard, and we pitched into it. Followed an excellent salad of tomatoes and crayfish, a good Indian curry, a tender joint of beef, a dish of pigeons, a pudding, cheese and coffee. I was so over-eaten after this [...] "hunger and burst" [...] that I could scarcely move; and it was my sad fate that night in the character of the local author to eloquute before the public--"Mr. Stevenson will read a selection from his own works"--a degrading picture. I had determined to read them the account of the hurricane; I do not know if I told you that my book has never turned up here, or rather only one copy has, and that in the unfriendly hands of ----. It has therefore only been seen by enemies; and this combination of mystery and evil report has been greatly envenomed by some ill-judged newspaper articles from the States. Altogether this specimen was listened to with a good deal of uncomfortable expectation {{on the part of the}} Germans, and when it was over was applauded with unmistakable relief. The public hall where these revels came off seems to be unlucky for me; I never go there but to some stone-breaking <b>job.</b> <b>Last</b> time it was the public meeting of which I must have written you; this time it was this uneasy but not on the whole unsuccessful experiment. Belle, my mother, and I rode home about midnight in a fine display of lightning and witch-fires. My mother is absent, so that I may dare to say that she struck me as voluble. The Amanuensis did not strike me the same way; she was probably thinking, but it was really rather a weird business, and I saw what I have never seen before, the witch-fires gathered into little bright blue points almost as bright as a night-light.|$|E

50|$|Transaction print {{jobs are}} {{different}} from 'publishing' print jobs in that the print controller does not know when the job will end when it starts.

40|$|It {{is only a}} {{year since}} the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) plunged most wealthy nations into recession. Australia escaped a ‘technical recession’ but {{unemployment}} rose by one third. Young people were among the worst affected because employers put new hires on hold, waiting for the economy to improve. This meant that many education leavers could not find work and many young people lost their casual jobs. Many young people who were {{unable to find a}} secure <b>job</b> <b>last</b> year are still out of work, because employers are reluctant to hire people who lack recent work experience. Between May 2008 and May 2009, the overall unemployment rose by one third but the unemployment rate for teenagers (15 - 19 years) rose by half. The unemployment rate for teenagers is still 18 %, three times that of the labour force as a whole (at 5 %). For young adults in their early twenties, the unemployment rate is 7 %. In May 2010 there were 193, 000 unemployed people under 25 on Youth Allowance or Newstart Allowance, of whom 94, 000 had been unemployed for over 12 months. The rise of youth unemployment has affected some regions more than others. In seventeen of the country’s 69 ‘labour market regions’ teenage unemployment rose to more than 30 % during 2009 - 10. Those regions include Wollongong (NSW), Northwest Melbourne (VIC), Far North Queensland, Western Adelaide (SA) and Central Perth (WA).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} how closely {{the variables of}} exposures to magnetic fields based on the <b>last</b> <b>job</b> held in an electrical utility in Québec, Canada, compared with those based on the workers' entire employment history with the company. METHODS: In large cohort studies, the <b>last</b> <b>job</b> held {{is often used to}} assign exposure to the study subjects. Exposure was assigned in this way for a mortality study of a cohort of electrical utility workers in Québec. For the present study, a sample of the cohort was used to compare the exposure estimates obtained from the <b>last</b> <b>job</b> with those obtained from full work histories. RESULTS: The correlations between indices based on the <b>last</b> <b>job</b> and on all jobs varied between 0. 75 and 0. 78. The mean was slightly lower when only the <b>last</b> <b>job</b> was used. The <b>last</b> <b>job</b> was particularly good in identifying the most highly exposed people (for the exposure cut off point of 90 th percentile for the <b>last</b> <b>job</b> and for all jobs, sensitivity = 0. 69, specificity = 0. 97, kappa = 0. 66). The results suggest that although not all workers starting in highly exposed jobs stayed in them, it seemed that the workers who ended their working life in highly exposed jobs had stayed in these jobs throughout their working life. CONCLUSION: The results indicated some (but not catastrophic) loss of information when estimates of exposure were based on the <b>last</b> <b>job</b> only...|$|R
