40|$|ABSTRACT The {{current study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the influence of three colors and two types of roofing materials under the internal temperature of bee colonies Apis mellifera. The experiment was conducted at the Agricultural Sciences Campus at the Federal University of Sao Francisco Valley located in Petrolina-PE, in November and December 2013, using 24 colonies housed in Langstroth hives. The experiment was a completely randomized factorial design (3 x 2) with three colors of box (blue, white, and traditional) and two types of cover (with and {{without the use of}} plaster) with six treatments and four replications. The internal temperature dates of the colonies were hourly recorded, during 24 hours, and surface temperatures were hourly recorded between 08 h 00 and 17 h 00. The highest values for surface and internal temperature were registered in the blue <b>painted</b> <b>boxes</b> without the use of plasterboard, and the blue <b>painted</b> <b>boxes</b> covered with plasterboard respectively. However, the lowest values &# 8203;&# 8203;were found in the white painted hives and hives that have not received the plasterboard. It is recommended to <b>paint</b> <b>boxes</b> with bright colors, and the use of plasterboard had no effect in reducing the internal temperature...|$|R
