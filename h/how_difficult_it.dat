5|$|Presently, the {{porcupine}} ray {{is caught}} incidentally in trawls, tangle nets, and beach seines. Its skin {{continues to be}} highly valued, while the meat and cartilage may also be utilized. In the Farasan Islands and some {{other places in the}} Red Sea, its liver is eaten as a seasonal dish. However, the economic importance of this ray is limited by <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> is to handle. The multi-species coastal fisheries that catch the porcupine ray are largely unregulated, which seems to have resulted in its dramatic decline or local extinction in the Bay of Bengal, the Gulf of Thailand, and likely elsewhere in its range. Potential additional threats to this species include habitat degradation from coastal development, and depletion of its food supply from overfishing. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E

While his position in the Joint Chiefs of Staff was intended to be limited, he had gained Kennedy's confidence and was often called on for private consultations. Shoup supported the test ban, seeing it as a deterrent to nuclear war.|$|E
5|$|A {{television}} {{broadcast of the}} concert, titled Madonna: The MDNA Tour, aired on Epix in the United States on June 22, 2013. The concert premiered at 8 p.m. EST on Epix's TV network and online at EpixHD.com and on Epix apps. On June 18, the concert special had a world premiere screening at The Paris Theater, in New York City, with Madonna attending the event {{in a press conference}} with the media, celebrities, and fans. A contest was released just for US residents, who had the chance to win two invitations for the special event. The singer wore a black tuxedo and a top hat to the premiere, the ensemble being a tribute to actress Marlene Dietrich and her similar attire in the 1930 film, Morocco. During the Q, Madonna recalled <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> was to sometimes perform on the tour, but she and her troupe nevertheless did it. At the end of the session, she showed a trailer from her secretprojectrevolution film with photographer Steven Klein; the one-minute clip featured her background dancers and showed the singer being dragged on the floor. Other shots included Madonna wielding a gun, her dancers in underwear, and religious iconography.|$|E
5|$|Soule {{was born}} in Keokuk, Iowa to a public school music teacher father and a graphic {{designer}} mother. He became interested in music and symphony orchestras {{at the age of}} five. Soule began taking piano lessons at an early age and became entranced with music, even writing music notation in the margins of his math homework; after his teachers and his father realized his talent, he began taking private lessons with professors from Western Illinois University when he was in sixth grade. He claims to have earned the equivalent of a master's degree in composition before completing high school, though, as he never enrolled in the school, he did not earn a degree. He was split between trying to become a concert pianist and a composer when he grew up; he ended up deciding to become a composer once he realized <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> would be to do both.|$|E

25|$|The {{quality of}} sleep may be {{evaluated}} from an objective and a subjective point of view. Objective sleep quality refers to <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> {{is for a}} person to fall asleep and remain in a sleeping state, and how many times they wake up during a single night. Poor sleep quality disrupts the cycle of transition between the different stages of sleep. Subjective sleep quality in turn refers to a sense of being rested and regenerated after awaking from sleep. A study by A. Harvey et al. (2002) found that insomniacs were more demanding in their evaluations of sleep quality than individuals who had no sleep problems.|$|E

25|$|Using these variables, {{the optimal}} diet model can predict how predators choose between two prey types: big prey1 with energy value E1 and {{handling}} time h1, and small prey2 with energy value E2 and handling time h2. In order to maximize its overall rate of energy gain, a predator {{must consider the}} profitability of the two prey types. If {{it is assumed that}} big prey1 is more profitable than small prey2, then E1/h1 > E2/h2. Thus, if the predator encounters prey1, it should always choose to eat it, because of its higher profitability. It should never bother to go searching for prey2. However, if the animal encounters prey2, it should reject it to look for a more profitable prey1, unless the time it would take to find prey1 is too long and costly for it to be worth it. Thus, the animal should only eat prey2 if E2/h2 > E1/(h1+S1), where S1 is the search time for prey1. Since it is always favorable to choose to eat prey1, the choice to eat prey1 is not dependent on the abundance of prey2. But since the length of S1 (i.e. <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> is to find prey1) is logically dependent on the density of prey1, the choice to eat prey2 is dependent on the abundance of prey1.|$|E

25|$|Now, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has {{invented the}} Esperanto language. It {{has all the}} {{potential}} qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice {{on the part of}} its devotees Esperanto will become universal. Therefore every one of us must study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of the world, and {{become a part of the}} curriculum in all the public schools. I hope that Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses, so that all people need acquire only two languages—one their own tongue and the other the international language. Then perfect union will be established between all the people of the world. Consider <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> is today to communicate with various nations.

Therefore I hope that you will make the utmost effort, so that this language of Esperanto may be widely spread.|$|E
