25|$|Somerled's origins are masked in obscurity and myth. Although no {{contemporary}} pedigree {{exists that}} outlines his ancestry, {{there are over}} a dozen later medieval, early modern, and modern sources that purport to outline Somerled's patrilineal descent. The names that these sources <b>give</b> <b>for</b> his father (GilleBride) and paternal grandfather (GilleAdamnan) appear to be corroborated in patronymic forms recorded in the Annals of Tigernach and the Annals of Ulster. The names in preceding generations, however, become more unusual, and the more authoritative sources begin to contradict each other. In consequence, two or three generations may be the furthest that Somerled's patrilineal lineage can be traced {{with any degree of}} accuracy. Somerled was almost certainly of Norse–Gaelic ancestry, and nothing is known of his early life. The History of the MacDonalds and the Book of Clanranald relate that his immediate ancestors were prominent in Argyll before being unjustly ejected by Scandinavians and Scots. Although these specific claims concerning his ancestors cannot be corroborated, Somerled's eventual marriage to a daughter of a reigning King of the Isles, and the marriage of one of the former's immediate kinswomen to the son of a King of Scotland, suggests that Somerled belonged to a family of considerable status.|$|E

[...] In St. Louis, Missouri, the Daily Reveille trumpeted that [...] "the flag of independence has been hoisted for the second time {{on this side of the}} Atlantic." [...] Horace Greeley in the New York Tribune wrote [...] "When a sincere republican is asked to say in sober earnest what adequate reason he can <b>give,</b> <b>for</b> refusing the demand of women to an equal participation with men in political rights, he must answer, None at all.

500|$|John Dudley also {{strove to}} {{alleviate}} the social situation. The 1547 [...] "Act for the Punishment of Vagabonds", which had enacted that any unemployed man found loitering was to be branded and given to the [...] "presentor" [...] as a slave, was abolished as too harsh in 1550. In 1552 Northumberland pushed a novel Poor Law through parliament which provided for weekly parish-based collections for the [...] "relief of the poor". Parishes were to register their needy inhabitants {{as well as the}} amounts people agreed to <b>give</b> <b>for</b> them, while unwilling contributors were to be [...] "induced" [...] by the parson and, if need be, by the bishop. The years 1549–1551 saw poor harvests and, accordingly, soaring food prices. Dudley tried to intervene against the malpractices of middlemen by official searches for hidden corn and by fixing maximum prices for grain, meat, and other victuals. However, the set prices were so unrealisitic that farmers stopped to sell their produce at the open market and the regulations had to be rescinded. The regime's agrarian policy, while giving landlords much freedom to enclose common land, also distinguished between different forms of enclosure. Landlords guilty of illegal enclosures were increasingly prosecuted.|$|E

500|$|The year 1947 {{became a}} career {{year for the}} now-sober Black. There was {{optimism}} in the Indians clubhouse regarding his talent, with manager Lou Boudreau saying that Black was [...] "a leading candidate for one of our starting jobs." [...] In his first pitching appearance of the season against the Detroit Tigers, a tough 53 victory, someone in the press box said, [...] "I wonder what he’d <b>give</b> <b>for</b> a slug of bourbon", to which he replied, [...] "All I wanted in that situation was a fresh stick of chewing gum. Bourbon doesn’t even tempt me." [...] He followed this with a 10 shutout win against the Chicago White Sox. A game against his former team, the Philadelphia Athletics, became the highlight of his career. On July 10, 1947, Black no-hit the Athletics 3-0 at Cleveland Stadium, allowing six walks and five strikeouts in besting Bill McCahan—himself a no-hit pitcher on September 3 of that 1947 season. Only Eddie Joost came close to getting a hit on Black, hitting a ball {{in the eighth inning}} that just barely went foul. On top of his no-hit performance, Black had two singles and a squeeze bunt that day. He was modest about his performance afterwards, saying [...] "My control was pretty bad. I got behind on a lot of hitters, but they didn't seem to hit me." [...] Black finished the season with ten wins, 12 losses, a 3.92 ERA, eight complete games, and three shutouts. At the end of the season, he was planning to play in the Cuban Winter League along with fellow Indians Bob Feller and Al López, though this did not eventuate. During the off-season, Black returned to his hometown of Salix, where he was given a key to the city and made honorary mayor for a day.|$|E
500|$|Soon after sobering up, Stewie {{stretches}} {{and takes}} out a Jenny Craig Anytime Bar from his shopping bag. [...] Brian loses his temper with Stewie for not revealing that he had been storing food the entire time, and Stewie punishes him by only offering one of the Bars he doesn't want to eat himself (though Brian is happy to have it). After Brian calms down, Stewie asks Brian why he has a gun, noting that Brian is a staunch gun control proponent and seems like the last person who would ever have a gun. Brian doesn't {{want to talk about it}} at first, but eventually admits to Stewie's shock and disbelief that he has the gun in case he ever feels he has to commit suicide. Brian confesses that he cannot find his purpose in life, and finds comfort in knowing he has the option of killing himself. He admits that the Scotch was to be a last drink. Stewie then admits that he would be lost without Brian, claiming he is the only person in the world that he really cares about; he tells a skeptical Brian that his earlier ranting against Brian was only an attack because Brian verball attacked him, and he finally tells Brian he loves him. Brian tells Stewie he loves him back. In addition, Stewie reminds Brian that maybe making someone else happy is enough, because it is the best gift one person can <b>give,</b> <b>for</b> which Brian thanks him. Stewie falls asleep as Brian reads the beginning of David Copperfield to him. The following morning, the vault door opens, and Brian carries a sleeping Stewie and their belongings out of the room in silence. The episode plays the closing credits without music as well.|$|E
