40|$|Gas flow {{dynamics}} in hollow core {{photonic crystal fibre}} (HC-PCF) is a trivial problem to study the <b>gas</b> <b>filling</b> time in HC-PCF gas sensor and other <b>gas</b> <b>filled</b> HC-PCF devices. This article analyzes the pressure dependence of gas diffusion coefficient in core and cladding holes of HC-PCF under the same condition of temperature and pressure during filling of methane and acetylene gas. An analytical model has been proposed to study the gas flow {{dynamics in}} core and cladding of HC-PCF. Due to <b>gas</b> <b>filling,</b> as the pressure varies inside the HC-PCF, at each increment of time, this model computes the change in pressure and respective gas diffusion coefficient.

40|$|AbstractThe {{transition}} from a liquid to a <b>gas</b> <b>filled</b> tubular network is the prerequisite for normal function of vertebrate lungs and invertebrate tracheal systems. However, the mechanisms underlying the process of <b>gas</b> <b>filling</b> remain obscure. Here we show that waterproof, encoding a fatty acyl-CoA reductase (FAR), {{is essential for the}} <b>gas</b> <b>filling</b> of the tracheal tubes during Drosophila embryogenesis, and does not affect branch network formation or key tracheal maturation processes. However, electron microscopic analysis reveals that in waterproof mutant embryos the formation of the outermost tracheal cuticle sublayer, the envelope, is disrupted and the hydrophobic tracheal coating is damaged. Genetic and gain-of-function experiments indicate a non-cell-autonomous waterproof function for the beginning of the tracheal <b>gas</b> <b>filling</b> process. Interestingly, Waterproof reduces very long chain fatty acids of 24 and 26 carbon atoms to fatty alcohols. Thus, we propose that Waterproof {{plays a key role in}} tracheal <b>gas</b> <b>filling</b> by providing very long chain fatty alcohols that serve as potential substrates for wax ester synthesis or related hydrophobic substances that ultimately coat the inner lining of the trachea. The hydrophobicity in turn reduces the tensile strength of the liquid inside the trachea, leading to the formation of a gas bubble, the focal point for subsequent <b>gas</b> <b>filling.</b> Waterproof represents the first enzyme described to date that is necessary for tracheal <b>gas</b> <b>filling</b> without affecting branch morphology.

40|$|Previously superhydrophobic {{surfaces}} {{have demonstrated}} effective drag reduction by trapping a lubricious gas layer {{on the surface}} with micron-sized hydrophobic features. However, prolonged reduction of drag is hindered by {{the dissolution of the}} gas into the surrounding water. This paper demonstrates a novel combination of superhydrophobic surface design and electrochemical control methods which allow quick determination of the wetted area and a gas replenishment mechanism to maintain the desirable <b>gas</b> <b>filled</b> state. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is used to measure the capacitance of the surface which is shown to be proportional to the solid/liquid interface area. To maintain a full gas coverage for prolonged periods the surface is held at an electrical potential which leads to hydrogen evolution. In the desired <b>gas</b> <b>filled</b> state the water does not touch the metallic area of the surface, however after gas has dissolved the water touches the metal which closes the electrochemical circuit causing hydrogen to be produced replenishing the gas in the surface and returning to the <b>gas</b> <b>filled</b> state; in this way the system is self-actuating. This type of surface and electrochemical control shows promise for applications where the <b>gas</b> <b>filled</b> state of superhydrophobic surfaces must be maintained when submerged for long periods of time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{resolve the}} {{problems}} of short working life and narrow operating voltage range of the spark gap with one-offin <b>gas</b> <b>filling</b> structure, a spark gap with repeatable <b>gas</b> <b>filling</b> structure was designed. The spark gap was composed of three electrodes and two gaps as well as <b>gas</b> <b>filling</b> devices. Electrodes structures adopted the form of field aberration three-electrode gas spark switch forming two discharge gaps between three electrodes of anode, cathode and triggering electrode. Gas filling devices were composed of fast connector, gas pipe, barometer and air valve, by which the gaps could be repeatedly charged and deflated from a hole {{at the center of}} anode. Working life is lengthened by exchanging gas, and operating voltage range is widened by changing gas pressure in a certain range. The spark gap was manufactured and applied successfully in a TEA CO 2 laser with pulse energy 170 J. The results prove the designs feasible...|$|R

The main outcome measures included percentage of <b>gas</b> <b>fill</b> of the vitreous cavity and intraocular pressure on postoperative day one. Results: Fifty eyes underwent 25 -gauge pars plana vitrectomy with 20 % SF 6 tamponade and 137 with 25 % SF 6 tamponade. On postoperative day one in the 20 % SF 6 group, there were five (10 %) patients with hypotony (intraocular pressure &le; 5 mmHg) and none in the 25 % SF 6 group. Mean intraocular pressure was 9 &plusmn; 2. 5 mmHg and 16. 8 &plusmn; 2. 4 mmHg for the 20 % SF 6 and 25 % SF 6 groups, respectively (P &lt; 0. 01). None of the patients had postoperative intraocular pressure &gt; 23 mmHg. Mean vitreous cavity <b>gas</b> <b>fill</b> on postoperative day one was 70. 7 % &plusmn; 10 % in the 20 % SF 6 group and 89. 5 % &plusmn; 2. 2 % in the 25 % SF 6 group (P &lt; 0. 01).
