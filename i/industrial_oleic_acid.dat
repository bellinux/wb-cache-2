40|$|Vegetable oils high in <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> are {{considered}} to be advantageous because of their better nutritional value and potential <b>industrial</b> applications. The <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> content in the classic safflower oil is normally 10 - 15 % while a natural mutant (ol) accumulates elevated <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> up to 70 % in seed oil. As a part of our investigation into the molecular features of the high oleic (HO) trait in safflower we have profiled the microRNA (miRNA) populations in developing safflower seeds expressing the ol allele in comparison to the wild type high linoleic (HL) safflower using deep sequencing technology. The small RNA populations of the mid-maturity developing embryos of homozygous ol HO and wild type HL safflower had a very similar size distribution pattern, however, only ~ 16. 5 % of the unique small RNAs were overlapping in these two genotypes. From these two small RNA populations we have found 55 known miRNAs and identified two candidate novel miRNA families to be likely unique to the developing safflower seeds. Target genes with conserved as well as novel functions were predicted for the conserved miRNAs. We have also identified 13 miRNAs differentially expressed between the HO and HL safflower genotypes. The results may lay a foundation for unravelling the miRNA-mediated molecular processes that regulate <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> accumulation in the HO safflower mutant and developmental processes in safflower embryos in general...|$|R
30|$|To control MNP {{clustering}} synthesis, {{the amount}} of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> on the synthesized MNPs should be first modulated. This is necessary because {{the amount of}} <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> affects MNC formation. Steric repulsion among the hydrocarbon tails of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> on individual MNPs impacts assembly capability of individual MNPs. To modify the amount of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> on the MNPs, the MNPs were dissolved in n-hexane and ethanol {{was added to the}} solution to remove part of the <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> coating. Finally, three samples of PMNPs were successfully obtained from the precipitates [25, 26], each coated with different <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> amounts: 19 (low PMNPs, LMNPs), 33 (medium PMNPs, MMNPs), and 46 (high PMNPs, HMNPs) wt.% (Figure  2 b).|$|R
40|$|The amidolytic {{activity}} of plasmin with the chromogenic substrate H-D-valyl-L-leucyl-L-lysine p-nitroanilide (S- 2251) is stimulated by <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> in a dose-dependent and saturable fashion. The {{activity of}} plasmin on S- 2251 {{in the presence}} of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> followed a sigmoidal kinetic pattern, with an almost 4 -fold stimulation of activity at 60 microM-oleic acid. Half-maximal stimulation occurred at an <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> level of 19. 5 microM. The amino acid analogue 6 -aminohexanoic acid (AHA), which is known to bind to lysine-binding sites in plasmin, suppressed the stimulatory effect of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> in a concentration-dependent manner; at 0. 3 mM-AHA, about 70 % of the oleic acid-dependent enhancement of plasmin activity was abolished. The l/v versus 1 /[S] plot for plasmin changed {{in the presence of}} <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> from a linear to a non-linear curve, suggesting positive co-operativity. 14 C-labelled <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> bound to plasmin, and the bound ligand was displaced by an excess of unlabelled <b>oleic</b> <b>acid.</b> <b>Oleic</b> <b>acid</b> also produced a marked (40 -fold) stimulation of the plasminogen-dependent cleavage of S- 2251 by urokinase. A half-maximal effect on plasminogen activation was obtained at 40 microM-oleic acid. The present findings suggest that the ability of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> to stimulate plasmin activity and to enhance the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin depends on the interaction of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> with specific lysine-binding sites in plasmin...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOur {{previous}} work {{has shown that}} <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> synthesized by astrocytes in response to serum albumin behaves as a neurotrophic factor in neurons, upregulating the expression of GAP- 43 and MAP- 2 proteins, which are respectively markers of axonal and dendrite growth. In addition, <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> promoted neuron migration and aggregation, resulting in clusters of neurons connected each other by the newly formed neurites. In this work we show {{that the presence of}} albumin or albumin plus <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> increases neuron migration in cultured explants of the lateral periventricular zone, resulting in {{an increase in the number}} of GAP- 43 -positive neurons leaving the explant. Upon silencing stearoyl-CoA desaturase- 1 (SCD- 1), a key enzyme in <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis by RNA of interference mostly prevented the effect of albumin but not that of albumin plus <b>oleic</b> <b>acid,</b> suggesting that the <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> synthesized due to the effect of albumin would be responsible for the increase in neuron migration. <b>Oleic</b> <b>acid</b> increased doublecortin (DCX) expression in cultured neurons, explants and organotypic slices, suggesting that DCX may mediate in the effect of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> on neuron migration. The effect of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> on neuron migration may be destined for the formation of synapses because the presence of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> increased the expression of synaptotagmin and that of postsynaptic density protein (PDS- 95), respectively markers of the pre- and postsynaptic compartments. In addition, confocal microscopy revealed the occurrence of points of colocalization between synaptotagmin and PDS- 95, which is consistent with the idea that <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> promotes synapse arrangement...|$|R

40|$|Low density {{lipoprotein}} cholesteryl [14 C]oleate (LDL-[14 C]CO) {{was used}} as a tool to label lysosomes with cholesteryl [14 C]oleate (CO) and to follow subsequently the metabolic processing of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> released by acid lipase. Liberated [14 C]oleate was incorporated into glycerolipids, mainly into phosphatidylcholine. Incubations in the presence of various concentrations of exogenously added <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> and double label experiments showed that <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> derived from lysosomal degradation of CO and exogenously added <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> distributed in a similar fashion among triacylglycerol and various phospholipids. To further study the metabolism of LDL-derived <b>oleic</b> <b>acid,</b> experiments were performed in which fibroblasts were prelabeled with LDL-[14 C]CO. The subsequent processing of lysosome-derived <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> was followed with time without LDL-[14 C]CO in the medium. From these experiments it became clear that apart from the esterification into glycerolipids a substantial part of lysosome-derived <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> was released into the medium. The efflux of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> into the medium preceded the incorporation into glycerolipids, was dependent on the composition of the extracellular medium, and was energy-independent.

The current petrol disaster and the valuable <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> loss by disposal to environment are the problematic reasons that the biopetrol should be synthesized from <b>oleic</b> <b>acid.</b> The objective {{of this study is to}} find the concentration of biopetrol (dominated by isooctane) from <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> in palm oil waste. Catalytic cracking process is used to synthesize isooctane from <b>oleic</b> <b>acid,</b> using zeolite as catalyst. <b>Oleic</b> <b>acid</b> is naturally in liquid form, so <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> is directly heated until achieving isooctane’s boiling point of 98 °C to form new arrangements of carbon compounds including isooctane. Various masses of catalyst are used, which are 1, 5, 10 and 20 g. After the cracking process is completed, the samples from <b>oleic</b> <b>acid’s</b> distillates were collected. The desired isooctane obtained is around 0. 04 - 2. 15 % in the distilled <b>oleic</b> <b>acid,</b> with the presence of hexane as dilution solvent. After applying back calculation to obtain actual isooctane concentrations in both distillates with comparison to the pure isooctane, the highest concentration of the desired isooctane in <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> distillate is 7. 886 % for 20 g zeolite...|$|R
40|$|The net {{transfer}} of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> between egg phosphatidylcholine unilamellar vesicles and bovine serum albumin has been monitored by 13 C NMR spectroscopy and 90 % isotopically substituted [1 - 13 C]oleic acid. The carboxyl chemical shifts of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> bound to albumin {{were different from}} those for <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> in phospholipid vesicles. Therefore, in mixtures of donor particles (vesicles or albumin with <b>oleic</b> <b>acid)</b> and acceptor particles (fatty acid-free albumin or vesicles), the equilibrium distribution of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> was determined from chemical shift and peak intensity data without separation of donor and acceptor particles. In a system containing equal masses of albumin and phospholipid and a stoichiometry of 4 - 5 mol of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> per mol of albumin, the <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> distribution was pH dependent, with {{greater than or equal}} to 80 % of the <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> associated with albumin at pH 7. 4; association was {{greater than or equal to}} 90 % at pH 8. 0. Decreasing the pH below 7. 4 markedly decreased the proportion of fatty acid bound to albumin; at pH 5. 4, less than or equal to 10 % of the <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> was bound to albumin and greater than 90 % was associated with vesicles. The distribution was reversible with pH and was independent of whether vesicles or albumin acted as a donor. These data suggest that pH may strongly influence the partitioning of fatty acid between cellular membranes and albumin. The 13 C NMR method is also advantageous because it provides information about the structural environments of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> bound to albumin or phospholipid, the ionization state of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> in each environment, and the structural integrity of the vesicles. In addition, minimum and maximum limits for the exchange rates of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> among different environments were obtained from the NMR data...|$|R

Whereas pyrolysis of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> without catalyst converted only about 10 %, the pyrolysis of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> adsorbed on catalysts allowed practically a complete conversion. NiO/alumina yielded a higher amount of liquid hydrocarbons than NiO/silica. The main products obtained with NiO/silica were 1 -alkenes, whereas the main products obtained with NiO/alumina were alkene isomers and aromatics.

40|$|The first Fe-based {{catalytic}} {{system for the}} oxidative cleavage of unsaturated fatty acids and esters to carboxylic acids is reported. The system comprises [Fe(OTf) (2) (6 -Me-PyTACN) ] (2) (6 -Me-PyTACN = 1 -[(6 -methyl- 2 -pyridyl) methyl]- 4, 7 -dimethyl- 1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane, OTf = trifluoromethane sulfonate anion) as the catalyst (3 mol%) either {{with a combination of}} hydrogen peroxide and NaIO 4 or exclusively with NaIO 4 as the oxidant, and operates at 0 degrees C or ambient temperature. Under these standard conditions (method A), methyl oleate is converted in a one-pot procedure into 50 - 55 % of both nonanoic and azelaic acid, together with some epoxide and aldehyde intermediates as byproducts. These yields can be further improved by addition of sulfuric acid (method B) to hydrolyze the epoxide byproducts, by including a pH neutralization step and addition of more catalyst (1 mol%). Under the optimized conditions, both methyl oleate and <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> are converted into high yields of the corresponding carboxylic acids (80 - 85 %). Overall, this {{catalytic system}} provides an alternative to the <b>industrial</b> ozonolysis of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> and to catalytic Ru-and Os-based systems for the oxidative cleavage of unsaturated fatty acids and esterB.

Aim: The aim of the present review is to clarify whether <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> has an effect on important mechanisms related to the carcinogenic processes. Methods:We searched electronic databases and biblio - graphies of selected articles were inspected for further reference. We focused our research on two cellular transformations characterizing cancer development: proliferation and cell death or apoptosis. Results: Numerous studies have reported an inhibition in cell proliferation induced by <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> in different tumor cell lines. Herein, <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> could suppress the over-expression of HER 2 (erbB- 2), a well-characterized oncogene which plays a key role in the etiology, invasive progression and metastasis in several human cancers. In addition, <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> could play a role in intracellular calcium signaling pathways linked to the proliferation event. Regarding cell death, <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> has been shown to induce apoptosis in carcinoma cells. The mechanisms behind the apoptotic event induced by <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> could be related to an increase in intracellular ROS production or caspase 3 activity. Several unsaturated fatty acids have been reported to induce apoptosis through a release of calcium from intracellular stores. However, evidence regarding such a role in <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> is lacking. Conclusions:Oleic acid plays a role in the activation of different intracellular pathways involved in carcinoma cell development. Such a role could be the root of its antitumoral effects reported in clinical studies...|$|R

Among the ICRISAT mini core collection accessions, <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> ranged from 33. 60 % to 73. 54 %. Accessions belonging to ssp. hypogaea had higher <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> (54. 16 %) {{compared with those}} of ssp. fastigiata (45. 70 %). An O : L ratio up to 6. 93 was found among ssp. hypogaea.

[BMCL ABSTRACT] © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. Protein kinase C (PKC) plays a pivotal role in transmembrane signaling in response to various hormones and neurotransmitters. 1, 2 It has been established that PKC is regulated by diacylglycerol (DAG) generated by receptor mediated phospholipid hydrolysis. The binding site of DAG in PKC has been determined using tumor promoting phorbol esters that bind to PKC with high affinity in a competitive manner with DAG. 3 In addition to DAG, PKC can be activated by free unsaturated fatty acid such as arachidonic aci...|$|R

Our results indicate the formation of a single lamellar phase in the presence of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> under the chosen experimental conditions; a separated fluid-like oleic acid-rich phase was not detected in the present study. By comparing the internal membrane structure received from Fourier synthesis with the model system lacking <b>oleic</b> <b>acid,</b> considerable structural changes in terms of impairment of the lamellar order were found after incorporation of the penetration enhancer into the bilayers. In addition, by using specifically deuterated <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> we were able to prove the integration of the enhancer molecules into the model bilayers and moreover, to determine the exact position of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> inside the SC lipid model membrane. From the present results we conclude a strong perturbation of lamellar SC lipid arrangement due to the intercalated penetration enhancer which can account for the promoting effects on drug penetration across the SC known for <b>oleic</b> <b>acid...</b>|$|R
40|$|The prooxidant role of free {{fatty acids}} was studied in soybean oil-in-water {{emulsions}}. Addition of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> (0 − 5. 0 % of oil) to the emulsions increased lipid hydroperoxides and headspace hexanal formation and increased the negative charge of the emulsion droplet with increasing <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration. Methyl oleate (1. 0 % of oil) did not increase oxidation rates. The ability of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> to promote lipid oxidation in oil-in-water emulsions decreased with decreasing pH with dramatic reduction in oxidation observed when the pH was low enough so that the <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> {{was not able to}} increase the negative charge of the emulsion droplet. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 200 μm) strongly inhibited lipid oxidation in emulsions with <b>oleic</b> <b>acid,</b> indicating that transition metals were responsible for accelerating oxidation. <b>Oleic</b> <b>acid</b> hydroperoxides did not increase oxidation rates, suggesting that hydroperoxides on {{free fatty acids}} are not strong prooxidants in oil-in-water emulsion.

Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) high <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> content lines {{differ from}} {{conventional}} sunflower {{by an increase}} in <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 18 : 1) content of more than 60 %. The current sunflower cultivars under production in South Africa are standard sunflower with high levels of linoleic acid (C 18 : 2). The aim {{of this study was to}} improve the quality of oil produced by local sunflower germplasm with respect to <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> through employing a marker-assisted breeding technique to facilitate and speed up the recovery of the high <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> allele into the background of the recurrent parent genome. Eleven sunflower breeding genotypes with high and low <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> traits were obtained from the Agricultural Research Council-Grain Crops Institute (ARC-GCI) in Potchefstroom. The breeding genotypes were phenotypically characterised based on their <b>oleic</b> and linoleic <b>acid</b> levels using gas chromatography. Results demonstrated that the average mean of <b>oleic</b> and linoleic <b>acid</b> contents in high <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> genotypes were 72 % and 17 % respectively, while the average mean of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> and linoleic acid contents in wild type lines were 33. 5 % and 54 % respectively. These results indicated a perfect negative correlation between the amount of <b>oleic</b> and linoleic <b>acids</b> possessed in high and low <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> genotypes (R 2 = - 99. 16 %). Sequence characterised amplified region (SCAR) markers were tested to ascertain if any of the ten available dominant FAD 2 - 1 markers was segregating with the high <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> allele. Four dominant SCAR markers (FAD 2 - 1 F 4 /R 1; FAD 2 - 1 F 4 /R 2; FAD 2 - 1 F 13 /R 1; FAD 2 - 1 F 14 /R 2) were strongly associated with the high <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> trait (P< 0. 001). With regard to the inheritance of the high <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> trait, 143 plants of the F 2 segregating population derived from a cross between the high <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> parent (AP 901 - 95 - 3 - 4 - 1) and low <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> parent (H 55 - 9 - 2 - 1 - 1) were genotyped with the four SCAR markers to determine the genetic state concerning the high <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> gene (Ol). Results from a Chi square analysis of the observed frequencies of each dominant FAD 2 - 1 marker locus in 143 F 2 individuals indicated that the deviation from the expected ratio of 3 : 1 (high to low <b>oleic</b> <b>acid)</b> was not statistically significant (P< 0. 95) from the observed segregation ratio. These results were consistent with the previous finding that an incomplete dominant gene governs sunflower high <b>oleic</b> <b>acid.</b> A multiplex assay of 78 Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers was optimised and evaluated on 143 plants of the F 2 population to determine suitable SSR markers that can be used in a marker-assisted background selection. Only 14 markers were suitable for marker-assisted background selection based on their high polymorphic information content, allele frequency and maximum allele numbers. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the potential of using SSR and SCAR marker systems as a breeding tool to characterise and speed up the selection process in marker-assisted backcross breeding.

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{inflammation}} is a {{key player}} in pathogenesis. The inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha is a well known inflammatory protein, and has been a therapeutic target for the treatment of diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis and Crohn's Disease. Obesity is a well known risk factor for developing non-insulin dependent diabetes melitus. Adipose tissue has been shown to produce tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which has the ability to reduce insulin secretion and induce insulin resistance. Based on these observations, we sought to investigate the impact of unsaturated fatty <b>acids</b> such as <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> in the presence of TNF-α in terms of insulin production, the molecular mechanisms involved and the in vivo effect of a diet high in <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> on a mouse model of type II diabetes, KKA y. Methods The rat pancreatic beta cell line INS- 1 was used as a cell biological model since it exhibits glucose dependent insulin secretion. Insulin production assessment was carried out using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and cAMP quantification with competitive ELISA. Viability of TNF-α and <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> treated cells was evaluated using flow cytometry. PPAR-γ translocation was assessed using a PPRE based ELISA system. In vivo studies were carried out on adult male KKA y mice and glucose levels were measured with a glucometer. Results <b>Oleic</b> <b>acid</b> and peanut oil high in <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> were able to enhance insulin production in INS- 1. TNF-α inhibited insulin production but pre-treatment with <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> reversed this inhibitory effect. The viability status of INS- 1 cells treated with TNF-α and <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> was not affected. Translocation of the peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor transcription factor to the nucleus was elevated in <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> treated cells. Finally, type II diabetic mice that were administered a high <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> diet derived from peanut oil, had decreased glucose levels compared to animals administered a high fat diet with no <b>oleic</b> <b>acid.</b> Conclusion <b>Oleic</b> <b>acid</b> was found to be effective in reversing the inhibitory effect in insulin production of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. This finding is consistent with the reported therapeutic characteristics of other monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, a diet high in <b>oleic</b> <b>acid,</b> which can be easily achieved through consumption of peanuts and olive oil, can have a beneficial effect in type II diabetes and ultimately reverse the negative effects of inflammatory cytokines observed in obesity and non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{modification}} of fatty acid composition of two sunflowers inbred lines, HA 89 and R 978, low <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> (normal) and high <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> (mutant) respec-tively, in seeds {{and during the}} first stages of growth (A 1 -B 2) was studied under controlled conditions. Enzymatic mechanisms have great effect on the catabo-lism of seed stored lipids. Temperature and oxygen regulation influence devel-oping sunflower seeds. For simultaneous study of seed and developing seed, half-seed analysis technique was used. The behavior of the fatty acids during the germination in cotyledon of seed showed the increase of linolenic acid in both lines, demonstrating the activity of linoleic acid desaturase (∆ 6 -desatu-rase). But linoleic acid as a substrate for linoleate desaturase increased during all stages of developing only in mutant line that revealed higher activity of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> desaturase (∆ 12 -desaturase) in transforming <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> to linoleic acid in this line, and lower activity of this enzyme in low <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> line, the reasons probably being the low availability of substrate of this enzyme in low <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> line and the complexity of enzymatic mechanisms.

40|$|The {{ability of}} <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> to {{modulate}} fibrinolysis {{was measured by}} following the urokinase-mediated and plasminogen-dependent cleavage of 125 I-labelled fibrin clots. <b>Oleic</b> <b>acid</b> levels within the physiological range exerted a concentration-dependent inhibition of urokinase-mediated fibrinolytic activity. SDS/PAGE revealed that <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> enhances urokinase activity but simultaneously increases the autolytic cleavage of the newly formed low-molecular-mass subunit of plasmin. Oleic acid-induced cleavage of this subunit containing the catalytic site of plasmin was suppressed by the plasmin substrate H-D-valyl-L-leucyl-L-lysine-p-nitroanilide (S- 2251) and was prevented by alpha 2 -antiplasmin. A concentration-dependent inhibition of the activity of purified plasmin on 125 I-labelled fibrin clot was also observed; 93 % and 50 % inhibition was noted with 150 microM and 32 microM <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> respectively. <b>Oleic</b> <b>acid</b> at 200 microM also effectively displaced plasmin prebound to a polylysine-Sepharose column. Examination of the fatty acid specificity showed that a minimal chain length of 16 carbon atoms {{and the presence of}} at least one double bond, preferably in a cis configuration, were required for inhibition of the fibrinolytic activity of plasmin. <b>Oleic</b> <b>acid</b> at a concentration that produced only a minimal inhibition of plasmin activity induced a marked inhibition by palmitic acid, while palmitic acid alone is ineffective.
