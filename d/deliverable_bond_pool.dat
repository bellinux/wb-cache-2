Furthermore, with a unique dataset, we show that prior to maturities of government bond futures, traders began to accumulate significant amounts of long positions for several selected contracts without the intention to offset, forcing short position holders to either purchase <b>deliverable</b> <b>bonds</b> or offset futures at highly inflated prices, causing higher market volatility and price disequilibrium in both spot and futures markets.

The first essay proves, in a model-free framework, that early exercise of futures-style options on futures, whether calls or puts, is suboptimal.

Assuming a frictionless market, three additional model-free results are obtained: (i) put-call parity, (ii) equality of time values of puts and calls {{with the same}} strike and expiration, and (iii) positivity of time value before expiration. The second essay develops a new invoice price formula for Treasury bond futures contracts as a more effective alternative to the current conversion factor system. The equilibrium "cheapest to deliver" and futures price at expiration are identified. The empirical part of the essay documents that the new function dramatically improves {{the ability of the}} futures invoice price to approximate the market prices of the corresponding <b>deliverable</b> <b>bonds.</b> The third essay offers a regression-based empirical study of the determinants of credit default swap premia.

The absence of appropriate credit enhancements can be considered among the factors that contributed to the underdevelopment of the Romanian municipal bond market segment mainly between 2011 and 2014.

[...] The main purpose of this statute is to allow local California governments {{to work together to}} get financing {{in a way that will}} conceivably lower borrowing costs. Underlying this concept is the belief that money can be saved through economies of scale by selling one large bond issue to finance several small projects. Through this legislation, local municipalities and other political subdivisions can join together by signing a Joint Powers Agreement, which creates a Joint Powers Authority ("JPA"). In its broadest terms, the Marks-Roos Act authorizes JPAs to issue Marks-Roos bonds and loan the proceeds to local governmental agencies and non-profit corporations to finance public capital improvements, working capital or insurance programs. Alternatively, JPAs can purchase the bonds of local agencies with the proceeds of Marks-Roos bonds. Marks-Roos bonds do not require voter approval. Instead they are approved by resolution of the JPAs. However, there is a requirement for the JPA to make the finding that the financing would result in significant public benefit prior to bond.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the implicit delivery option in a bond futures contract {{and its effect}} on the contract's hedging effectiveness. Bond futures are widely used in hedging of government debt securities. In this thesis, the delivery option arises from the futures seller's right to choose which <b>bond,</b> among several <b>deliverable</b> <b>bonds,</b> will be delivered at the delivery date. To the extent this delivery option has value it should be reflected in a reduced futures price, because the buyer of futures must be compensated for the freedom of choice the seller has in choosing the asset to be delivered. The objective of the study is to price the futures contract and its delivery option in a theoretically consistent framework. In particular, the difference in valuing the option under constant interest rate and under stochastic term structure will be emphasized. Secondly, this paper studies whether the delivery option harms or helps the hedging effectiveness of the futures contract. Also, the effectiveness of the widely used conversion factor hedging method is questioned in the stochastic interest rate environment. The base for modelling the delivery option is the formula generating value for an exchange option. This formula was first introduced by Margrabe (1978) and is an extension of the Black-Scholes solution (1973) to option pricing problem. The delivery option will be modelled in the fixed interest rate environment (Hemler 1990) and under stochastic term structure (Lin and Paxson 1995). The stochastic term structure of interest rates will be represented with a term structure model by Heath, Jarrow and Morton (1992), although only the intuition of the HJM -model will be presented. The result of this paper is that the delivery option has to be included to the futures pricing formula and the theoretical equilibrium price of the futures contract with the delivery option can be obtained on a theoretically consistent basis. Secondly, there were no evidence that the delivery option would significantly harm the hedging effectiveness of the Euro-Bund futures contract. Theoretical drawbacks of the conversion factor hedging method appeared only, when hedging short-term bonds with the 10 -year Bund futures con-tract. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Economics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. South African {{municipalities}} today face enormous challenges. They {{are faced}} with severe infrastructure backlogs, increased service provision and deteriorating municipal finance. These services, which include water, sanitation, electricity and waste disposal {{are essential to the}} basic needs of all citizens in South Africa, and contribute greatly to local economic development. Municipalities lack the necessary revenue to supply these essential services, or the necessary infrastructure to support these services. Because of this, and in order not to cause further deterioration of municipal service provision, additional infrastructure investment for municipalities in South Africa is needed, and fast. Additional investment can come from various sources, but government's ultimate goal is to see private finance or private capital, flow to the municipal sector. This can be achieved either through issuing municipal bonds, or by providing bank loans to municipalities. Previously (before 1994), South Africa still had a municipal bond market, and both of these instruments traded, but currently the composition of debt is changing. Securities debt remains to decrease, while loan debt increases continuously - a principle, which is inconsistent with that which government wishes to achieve at this stage. The residual credit market in South Africa is largely an intermediate one, with banks and other financial intermediaries holding most loans. Government wishes to see this market supplemented by the development and expansion of a securities market, or a "bond model" that lowers the cost of capital to the municipal sector. This market will imply that municipalities (usually the larger ones) issue debt in the form of bonds, which will then trade in the secondary market. To encourage this, government in South Africa designed the main elements of a municipal debt market necessary to support such a framework. This framework supports the direct access of municipalities to the municipal bond market, rather than the indirect access by intermediaries, which is currently the case. The two intermediaries currently operating in South Africa is INCA - a private sector intermediary, and the DBSA - a public sector intermediary. Together these two market players hold {{more than half of all}} municipal debt in South Africa. In supporting a market where direct capital market access is achievable, or where municipalities issue municipal bonds, a few essential things have to be in place first. This becomes obvious when one considers the underlying strengths of the United States municipal bond market, which makes use of the direct access method or municipal bond issuance. One of the most important market strengths of the United States is the fact that U. S. municipalities,. unlike most municipalities in South Africa, are creditworthy. This creditworthiness can mainly be ascribed to three things, (i) adequate revenue that supports borrowing, (ii) reliable financial information, which is necessary for public disclosure, and (iii) proper credit ratings. All three these elements are important to ensure municipal creditworthiness. South Africa faces enormous constraints on all three these elements. Firstly, South African municipalities do not have adequate revenue to support borrowing, mainly due to debt outstanding, and revenue collection problems. Secondly, the financial information of most municipalities in South Africa - which is imperative for public disclosure - is usually absent, late or unreliable, and thirdly, only five municipalities in South Africa currently reported having credit. The creditworthiness of most municipalities in South Africa seems to be the greatest obstacle in the way of municipal bond market development. If South Africa wishes to achieve successful and efficient ways to aid the re-emergence of the municipal bond market, it would have to reduce the credit risk of most municipalities. Municipalities can reduce credit risk by making use of certain credit enhancement mechanisms that will also provide additional investment. There are various forms of credit enhancement mechanisms available, which include government lending, government grants, government subsidies, and government guarantees, interception of intergovernmental transfers, municipal bond insurance, bank letters of credit, and making use of special purpose intermediaries. Many special purpose intermediaries do exist in the world today, which include anything from municipal development banks to bond banks. The United States successfully uses bond banks that give access to smaller, poorly rated municipalities via a process known as ''bond <b>pooling.</b> " <b>Bond</b> <b>pooling</b> involves a concept where a number of small municipalities pool their issues together to create one large <b>bond</b> <b>pool</b> with numerous advantageous. Although larger municipalities in South Africa would have no problem accessing the municipal bond market directly via bond issuance, smaller un-creditworthy municipalities would find it much more difficult to access the municipal bond market via bond issuance. One solution to the problem could be if the smaller poorly rated municipalities, makes use of a municipal bond bank similar to the municipal bond banks in the United States. The proposed bond bank, besides providing access assistance to smaller municipalities could also provide certain technical assistance and training concerning the municipal bond market, bond issuance, the role of municipalities in this market, all the requirements necessary for municipalities to access this market effectively, and municipal creditworthiness. Since the majority of municipalities in South Africa do not have the necessary requirements to access the capital market directly, and secondly, since this direct access method would solve the problem of only a few exceptional municipalities in South Africa, the government proposed framework seems ineffective. One solution could be if the South African government instead of making use of municipal bond issuance uses an intermediary like the bond bank to access additional finance. Although this would be indirect contrast with that, which government wishes to achieve it could be the only solution in reactivating or stimulating the municipal bond market. Master...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{mortgage}} credit growth experienced {{in recent years}} in mature and emerging countries has raised some stability concerns. Many European credit institutions in mature markets have reacted by increasing securitization, particularly via mortgage covered bonds. From the issuer''s perspective, these instruments have become an attractive funding source and a tool for assetliability management; from the investor''s perspective, covered bonds enjoy a favorable risk-return profile and a very liquid market. In this paper, we examine the two largest "jumbo" covered bond markets, Germany and Spain. We show how movements in covered bond prices can be used to analyze the credit developments of the underlying issuer and the quality of its mortgage portfolio.

40|$|AbstractAs {{the private}} sector and {{government}} begin to spend billions of dollars to research and deploy carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, the question of legal liability for managing short-term and long-term environmental, health and safety risks must be addressed. We examine potential CCS liability within a U. S. context and survey the existing environmental and tort law liability regimes that may affect CCS. We conclude that while existing liability regimes are insufficient on their own to govern the CCS industry, they could provide important risk management tools and serve as safeguards to private parties and governments in the event of harm. We also propose a model for long term stewardship, blending including <b>bonding,</b> insurance, and <b>pooled</b> federal funding into commercial CCS project management to better provide financial security to investors without destroying existing liability protections for those who may suffer harm from CCS. This proposal offers a starting point to develop a model to integrate liability for the nascent CCS industry. A longer version of this paper {{can be found in the}} Emory Law Review, Fall 2008...|$|R

Major parts include the incorporation of phosphorothioate nucleotides, the chemical fragmentation at these positions, the introduction of universal or degenerate bases and their replacement by natural nucleotides inserting point mutations. Initially, universal “SeSaM”-sequences are inserted by PCR with gene-specific primers binding in front of and behind the gene of interest. The gene of interest with its flanking regions is amplified to introduce these SeSaM_fwd and SeSaM_rev sequences and to generate template for consecutive PCR steps. These generated so-called fwd template and rev templates are now amplified in a PCR reaction with a pre-defined mixture of phosphorothioate and standard nucleotides to ensure an even distribution of inserted mutations over {{the full length of}} the gene. PCR products of Step 1 are cleaved specifically at the phosphorothioate <b>bonds,</b> generating a <b>pool</b> of single-stranded DNA fragments of different lengths starting from the universal primer. In Step 2 of SeSaM, the DNA single strands are elongated by one to several universal or degenerate bases (depending on the modification of SeSaM applied) catalyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). This step is the key step to introduce the characteristic consecutive mutations to randomly mutate entire codons. Subsequently, in Step 3 a PCR is performed recombining the single stranded DNA fragments with the corresponding full-length reverse template, generating the full-length double stranded gene including universal or degenerate bases in its sequence. By replacement of the universal/degenerate bases in the gene sequence by random standard nucleotides in SeSaM Step 4, a diverse array of full-length gene sequences with substitution mutations is generated, including a high load of transversions and subsequent substitution mutations.|$|R
