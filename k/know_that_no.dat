These were, by far, her most inspiring words to date, letting others <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> matter what they were doing, no matter how {{difficult}} things were, with help they would win through. Musically, the piece had a restrained dance beat, very Mowtownish, that owed {{a little more to}} gospel, with a chorus - sung by Mariah, Trey and Patrique - that rose gloriously from the verse to repeat and drive and its very positive message home.|$|E

25|$|Then the debaters {{return to}} their {{previous}} analysis of Pittacus' and Simonides' poetry. On Socrates' interpretation, Pittacus claims {{that it is difficult}} to be a good man, but presumably possible. Simonides, on the other hand, claims that it is impossible to live without ever being a bad man, and even to be a good man on occasion is difficult (344a45d). Simonides praises those who at least do not do wrong willingly. Socrates' interpretation is that, since Simonides was a wise man, he must <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> one does any wrong willingly; accordingly, he must mean that he will willingly praise those who do no wrong, not that some do wrong willingly and others unwillingly, only the latter garnering his praise (345d46b). Socrates thus argues that the authority of Simonides does not stand against his understanding of virtue and whether anyone willingly does wrong.|$|E

Barr allegedly tweeted [...] "At first I thought it was good to let ppl <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> one can hide anymore ... If Zimmerman isn't arrested I'll rt his address again- maybe go 2 his house myself." [...] Zimmerman's parents allege that Barr sought to [...] "cause a lynch mob to descend" [...] on their home. The Seminole County Circuit Court complaint sought more than $15,000 for emotional distress and invasion of privacy. In August 2015, summary judgment was granted in favor of Barr.|$|E

500|$|The Indian Mahayana {{schools were}} {{divided on the}} issue of the {{possibility}} of reflexive awareness (svasaṃvedana). Dharmakīrti accepted the idea of reflexive awareness as expounded by the Yogacara school, comparing it to lamp that illuminates itself while also illuminating other objects. This was strictly rejected by Mādhyamika scholars like Candrakīrti. Since in the philosophy of the Mādhyamika all things and mental events are characterized by emptiness, they argued that consciousness could not be an inherently reflexive ultimate reality since that would mean it was self validating and therefore not characterized by emptiness. These views were ultimately reconciled by the 8th century thinker Śāntarakṣita. In Śāntarakṣita's synthesis he adopts the idealist Yogācāra views of reflexive awareness as a conventional truth into the structure of the two truths doctrine. Thus he states: [...] "By relying on the Mind-Only system, know that external entities do not exist. And by relying on this Middle Way system, <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> self exists at all, even in that [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|The typical {{method of}} proving {{a problem to}} be {{undecidable}} is with the technique of reduction. [...] To do this, it is sufficient to show that if {{a solution to the}} new problem were found, it could be used to decide an undecidable problem by transforming instances of the undecidable problem into instances of the new problem. [...] Since we already <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> method can decide the old problem, no method can decide the new problem either. Often the new problem is reduced to solving the halting problem. (Note: the same technique is used to demonstrate that a problem is NP complete, only in this case, rather than demonstrating that there is no solution, it demonstrates there is no polynomial time solution, assuming P ≠ NP).|$|E
2500|$|While {{living in}} Cold Springs he {{maintained}} {{a friendship with}} another writer Conrad Richter. Conrad and his wife lived in Pine Grove, Pennsylvania, which was a nearby town. Letters between the two as well as pictures in possession of the family reflect a close camaraderie. Conrad once wrote [...] "If anyone has a unique paradise of his own on earth, that one is Mulford Foster, Master {{of one of the}} prettiest and wildest valleys in Pennsylvania, he has on his immense primeval estate a limpid lake where wood creatures come down to drink, a magic winding little river for his silent canoe, a collection of almost every variety of domestic animal and bird, pet skunks, several dozen kinds of tamed snakes, wild flowers, trees and shrubs and a million wild creatures that have flocked to his place from the mountains about because they <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> harm can come to them here, and Foster attired in brown flannel and stealing noiselessly through the woods with the light foot and deftness of a Mohican, is all day long and often at evening out among them.".|$|E
