40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} the banking system concentration on the perception of financial institutions interdependencies, as measured by the correlations of their return on assets. This correlation is observed by the market, and may provide an indicator of systemic risk potential, which we argue represents an <b>indirect</b> <b>contagion</b> channel. By changing this correlation, the degree of concentration may change the systemic risk exposure of the banking sector. Our findings suggest the existence of an <b>indirect</b> <b>contagion</b> channel in Brazil, and that a more concentrated financial system is associated with an increase in the potential of systemic risk among banks with similar characteristics of credit volume, leverage and ownership (state or private-owned). Our findings call attention to the implications of financial system consolidation to the contagion of idiosyncratic shocks. Banking consolidation may bring benefits by improving the diversification of the portfolios of banks, reducing their idiosyncratic risks, but may also increase the systemic risk, by increasing the probability of an idiosyncratic shock be interpreted as an aggregate shock. ...|$|E

It specifically investigates whether the slump in the US stock prices directly produced a slump in Indonesian stock prices, or indirectly through the slump in regional stock prices. It also examines whether the slump spilled over into rupiah exchange rate. Using Vector Autoregression and Vector Error Correction Model, the paper finds direct contagion effect of the US financial crisis into Indonesian stock markets. It also finds both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>contagion</b> effect of the US financial crisis into foreign exchange market.

In particular we explain how to disentangle the direct and <b>indirect</b> (<b>contagion)</b> effects of such a shock, how to exhibit the contagion network and how to detect the ”superspreaders”, i. e. the most important firms involved in the contagion process. This method is applied to a network of 8 large European banks in order to analyze whether the revealed interconnections within these banks differ depending on the underlying measure of banks’ financial positions, namely their market capitalization, the price of the CDS contract written on their default and their book value...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{two major}} channels of P 2 P lending risk contagion in China—direct risk contagion between platforms and <b>indirect</b> risk <b>contagion</b> with other financial organizations as the contagion medium. Based on this analysis, {{the current study}} constructs a complex network model of P 2 P lending risk contagion in China and performs dynamics analogue simulations in order to analyze general characteristics of direct risk contagion among China’s online P 2 P lending platforms. The assumed conditions are that other financial organizations act as the contagion medium, with variations in the risk contagion characteristics set under the condition of significant information asymmetry in Internet lending. It is indicated that, compared to direct risk contagion among platforms, both financial organizations acting as the contagion medium and information asymmetry magnify the effect of risk contagion. It is {{also found that the}} superposition of media effects and information asymmetry is more likely to magnify the risk contagion effect...|$|R

The feedback and cross effects have shown their importance, and evidenced the need for more complete models that include circular feedbacks, cross linkages and side effects. In this paper we have developed a comprehensive simulation model for testing if these “secondary” effects have a relevant impact on the system, so that a more holistic approach can lead to more effective evaluations. The model includes <b>indirect</b> correlation and <b>contagion</b> between banks and public finances, and the sensitivity of both to the real economy variations.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{real estate}} markets during the 1997 – 98 Financial crisis in Asian economies has received little attention despite the extensive research on other asset markets over this time. This paper examines the transmission of shocks across national real estate markets prior to and during the Asian crisis using a multivariate latent factor framework. The results reveal that diversification opportunities prior to the crisis are much reduced during the crisis. A comparison with regional equity markets shows that the transmission of shocks differs across the real estate and equity markets, providing evidence that investment in multiple asset classes provides some protection from large market downturns.

40|$|In {{classical}} contagion models, default {{systems are}} Markovian conditionally on {{the observation of}} their stochastic environment, with interacting intensities. This necessitates that the environment evolves autonomously and is not influenced by {{the history of the}} default events. We extend the classical literature and allow a default system to have a contagious impact on its environment. In our framework, contagion can either be contained within the default system (i. e., direct contagion from a counterparty to another) or spill from the default system over its environment (<b>indirect</b> <b>contagion).</b> This type of model is of interest whenever one wants to capture within a model possible impacts of the defaults of a class of debtors on the more global economy and vice versa...|$|E

40|$|This thesis studies {{systemic}} risk through direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>contagion</b> in financial networks. The first and main part {{is devoted to}} modelling the phenomenon of fire sales in a network of financial institutions with common asset holdings, subject to leverage or capital constraints. In contrast to balance sheet contagion based on direct linkages, this price-mediated contagion occurs through common asset holdings, which we quantify through liquidity-weighted overlaps across portfolios. Exposure to price-mediated contagion leads {{to the concept of}} indirect exposure to an asset class, as a consequence of which the risk of a portfolio depends on the network of overlapping portfolios. Our model provides an operational systemic stress testing framework for quantifying the exposure of the financial system to these effects. Using data from the European Banking Authority, we examine the exposure of the EU banking system to price-mediated contagion. Our results indicate that, even with optimistic estimates of market depth, moderately large macro-shocks may trigger fire sales which lead to substantial losses across bank portfolios, modifying the outcome of bank stress tests. Moreover, we show that price-mediated contagion leads to a heterogeneous cross-sectional loss distribution across banks, which cannot be replicated simply by applying a discount factor to portfolios. We propose a bank-level indicator, based on liquidity-weighted overlaps of portfolios which can be used to quantify the contribution of a financial institution to price-mediated contagion. Using a granular supervisory dataset, we show that asset class aggregation has a considerable effect on estimated portfolio-level fire sales losses, an issue ignored in the literature so far. The second part presents an in-depth sensitivity analysis of the Eisenberg & Noe model, a framework commonly used in {{systemic risk}} studies. We develop a Taylor series for the clearing vector and characterise it in terms of estimation errors in the liabilities matrix. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays examining how corporate fraud and litigation impact on financial markets. The first essay examines the direct effects of these events and the second essay examines the <b>indirect,</b> or <b>contagion,</b> effects. The underlying theme behind both essays is that corporate fraud is a classic manifestation of agency cost/information asymmetry problems. The study consists of an examination of over 451 fraud and litigation cases between 1993 and 1999. Essay I reports that announcing firms experience serious wealth, volume, bid-ask spread, firm specific risk and systematic risk shifts in relation to both the fraud (F) and law-suit (C) disclosures. Moreover, these influences persist {{for an extended period}} beyond the events. Interestingly, systematic risk measures drop sharply following the events. The results suggest that these extreme agency events seriously “dislocate” normal market relationships (beta) and that firm specific risk becomes a pricing factor. We also find support for the argument that PSLRA represented a weakening in the monitoring and bonding regime available to shareholders. In the second essay we examine the pure contagion effects of the fraud and litigation cases. We start from the premise that as fraud events are firm-specific, which is the tenor of any lawsuit, then, if any industry wide contagion reaction were to occur it would be of the pure contagion form. Essay II 2 ̆ 7 s principal finding is that strong pure contagion responses are evident following both fraud (F) disclosures and class action (C) filings. In further analysis, we identify that the intensity of the contagion reactions is generally linked to well recognized measures of risk, notably: book-to-market ratios (Fama 2 ̆ 6 French, 1993); leverage (Fama 2 ̆ 6 French, 1988), up markets (or time varying risk premia (Fama 2 ̆ 6 French, 1988)) and the level of regulatory protection (Ali and Kallapur, 2001). This link to risk is interesting as it suggests that contagion susceptibility may be predictable. These pure contagion results underline the continued threat that fraud and litigation represent to well functioning financial markets. ...|$|R
40|$|Systemic risk {{concerns}} {{the stability of}} systems composed by different parts, specifically the prediction and prevention of systemic events. A systemic event is typically defined as a phenomenon that emerges from the complex interactions of the constituents and compromises the normal functioning of the system. In particular, in finance the elementary constituents are financial institutions, such as banks, and systemic risk pertains the description and prevention of collapses that involve large portions of the financial system. After the recent troubled years for the global economy, in which two severe crises (the 2007 crisis of financial markets and the 2010 sovereign debt crisis) have put the whole economic system in dramatic distress, vulnerability of banks to systemic events is now {{the main focus of}} a growing number of investigations of the academic community, crosswise different disciplines. When a bank undergoes some sort of malfunctioning or distress, and its troubled situation negatively affects other institutions, we say that distress propagates, and that the interactions among the two institutions serves as channel of contagion. Networks are one of the main tools in the modelling and description systemic risk in financial systems, since they allow for a straightforward description of different channels of contagion. The indirect channel of contagion can be described as a bipartite network, i. e. a network where the set of nodes is sharply divided into two subsets, one containing only banks, the other only assets. Banks can only be connected with assets but not with other banks. Moreover, a link exist if the bank holds the asset in its portfolio, i. e. invests in that particular assets. In order to quantify losses from <b>indirect</b> <b>contagion</b> a full knowledge of how the banks divide their investments is needed. As quantifiers of systemic risk we consider systemicness and vulnerability of a bank as, respectively, the total percentage loss induced on the system by the distress of the bank and the total percentage loss experienced by the bank when the whole system is in distress. An important part of our thesis is dedicated to the empirical analysis of a dataset that we originally developed, collecting data publicly available from the databases of the Federal Reserve, that describes the quarterly networks of US commercial banks’ exposures in the period 2001 - 2015. Specifically we compute, for each quarter, systemicness and vulnerability of each bank and the aggregate vulnerability of the system. From our network description of the system, it emerges that there is a clear relation between the vulnerability of the system to external shocks and the way in which the largest banks present manage their investments, as we show in Figure 1. The central topic of the thesis is the problem of reconstructing systemic risk measures from partial information on the network, e. g. knowing only the size of the banks present and the capitalization of the assets available. Our main purpose is to develop efficient methods to estimate systemic risk from partial information, without the full knowledge of the bipartite network. A prolific analogy between statistical mechanics and the statistical inference of networks, has been proposed and exploited by physicists. Network ensembles can be defined, akin to grand canonical ensembles in statistical mechanics, and they can be used to efficiently reconstruct networks from the sole partial information available. Ensembles are endowed with a probability mass function on a set of graphs that depends on a set of parameters, that in turn need to be estimated numerically from the partial information available. Banks statistics, that are related to the network structure, are estimated through their expected values on the statistical ensemble. We implemented the numerical procedures needed to practically employ ensembles of bipartite networks to systemic risk reconstruction, and applied them to the reconstruction of systemicness and indirect vulnerability. In order to test the reconstruction capability of our ensembles, we assume that the balance sheet compositions of the banks are not known, estimate the measures of systemic risk, trough network ensembles, and finally compare the real statistics computed for our dataset, with the values inferred from partial information. This ex-post comparison allows us to asses whether our methods are appropriate when the network structure is actually unknown. While network ensembles based on Bose-Einstein statistic are now a standard tool in network science, we found them to be unfit for the reconstruction of systemic risk. In fact better suited ensembles, for the purpose of systemic risk reconstruction, are defined trough a bold extension to networks of the correct Boltzmann counting of states. We refer to the resulting ensembles as Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) ensembles. Inspired by the analogy with statistical mechanics, we propose an extension of the diffused Max-Ent approach to the definition of network ensembles, and we refer to it as Minx-Ent. Via Minx-Entr we define a family of ensembles that includes as limiting cases BE and MB ensembles, and propose it as a new tool for the reconstruction of networks statistics. At the end of this thesis we propose a, previously unexplored, application of grand- canonical ensembles, to a subject not directly related to systemic risk, i. e. “filtering of complex networks”. Often complex networks, that describe real systems, are extremely dense. A large network with a high edge density may be hard to interpret, or visualize by traditional tools of network analysis. In addition, a large portion of the links might not be informative, or subject to measurement errors. Hence it is sometimes useful to extract sub-networks, that contain only a portion of the original nodes and links. The reduction of “noisy” networks, in order to maintain only relevant information, is known as information filtering in complex networks. We propose an original technique for the filtering of complex networks based on grand-canonical ensembles. A Portion of this thesis has been the object of the paper Di Gangi, Lillo, and Pirino (“Assessing systemic risk due to fire sales spillover through maximum entropy network recon- struction”), currently undergoing reviewing process...|$|E
