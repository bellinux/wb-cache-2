50|$|Cold <b>foil</b> <b>{{printing}},</b> {{also known}} as cold foil stamping, is a modern method of printing metallic foil on a substrate {{in order to enhance}} the aesthetic of the final product. Cold <b>foil</b> <b>printing</b> can be done two ways: the older dry lamination process common in the offset printing industry, or the newer, more versatile wet lamination process, which is dominant in the flexo label industry.|$|E
50|$|Cold foil {{takes the}} idea of hot foil {{stamping}} and makes it more convenient and cost-effective. The cold foil functions like an additional ink and is actually a UV-curable, very fast lamination adhesive and can be bonded in-line in a single run using a printing plate for either flexographic web printing or offset sheet-fed printing. It can be applied precisely with high resolution, even for fine structures such as raster gradients and thin lines. Typeface is legible from about 5 points upwards and has excellent edge definition. Cold <b>foil</b> <b>printing</b> needs smooth surface substrates for excellent image quality.|$|E

50|$|Before the hippie {{movement}} Rit Dye {{was known}} as a hobby for older women. Other methods of decorating shirts include using paints, markers, fabric transfer crayons, dyes, spray paint, and many more. Some techniques that can be used include sponging, stenciling, , , screen printing, bleaching, and many more. As technology advances, it offers more experimentations and possibilities for designers and artists to seek for innovative techniques with their T-shirts. Rumplo, a site cofounded by Sahadeva Hammari, a startup t-shirt site that used to designed and carried over 13,000 T-shirts. Their designs used multiple futuristic techniques, such as glow-in-the-dark inks, heat-sensitive fabrics, <b>foil</b> <b>printing</b> to all-over printing. Designers like Robert Geller, a German-born American fashion designer, came out a secondary collection, Seconds featuring oversized graphic t-shirts made from supersoft jersey. Alexander Wang, on the other hand, came out with variations of t-shirts from oversized scoop necks, tanks to striped, slouchy rayon jerseys. Artist like Terence Koh, took a different approach, with t-shirts featuring an upside down portrait with a real bullet hole hand finished by him for the Soho store Opening Ceremony.|$|E

50|$|Metal Foil Deep Etching is a {{plastograph}} {{print in}} which aluminium foil {{is used to}} draw the engraved images. The thin foil is cut and placed on an engraved plate and then the embossed sheet is removed, turned over and filled with resin to stabilise the relief. The resin filled foil is then laminated on plywood or no any other surface. Onobrakpeya first started experimenting with foils and from the experiments transformed the <b>foils</b> into a <b>print</b> medium in the 1980s. He used already printed plates to try out the technique. Metal <b>Foil</b> Relief <b>Print</b> is a three-dimensional metal <b>foil</b> <b>print</b> drawn on a plastocast plate. A fairly thick foil is cut and placed over a plate and hand pressed to transfer {{the shape of the}} picture on the plate. The foil is then removed and filled from behind. It is then laminated onto a plywood and coloured {{in the same way as}} the metal <b>foil</b> deep etching <b>print</b> process already discussed above. Note that while the metal <b>foil</b> deep etching <b>print</b> is drawn from plastograph plates, the metal <b>foil</b> relief <b>print</b> is hand embossed on a plastograph plate.|$|R

In 1974, following his retrospective exhibit at the Mornington Peninsula Arts Centre, the National Gallery of Australia acquired 279 of Baldessin's etching plates and prints: this set was the first nucleus of the National Gallery's collection of his works. Together with Imants Tillers, Baldessin represented Australia at the XIII São Paulo Art Biennial in 1975, exhibiting the set of etchings Occasional Images from a City Chamber, and the sculptural work Occasional Screens with Seating Arrangement. From 1975 to 1977 Baldessin lived in Paris; during his French sojourn he attended the Lacourière-Frélaut engraving workshop and hung out with Imants Tillers, soon becoming close friends with him.|$|R

40|$|Cracks, formed {{during the}} drying of {{particulate}} films, {{can reduce the}} effectiveness or even render products useless. We present a novel, generic approach to suppress crack formation in thin films made from hard particle suspensions, which are otherwise highly susceptible to cracking, using the capillary force between particles present when a trace amount of an immiscible liquid is added to a suspension. This secondary liq- uid preserves the particle cohesion, modifying the structure and increasing the drying rate. Crack-free films can be produced at thicknesses {{much greater than the}} critical cracking thickness for a suspension without capillary interactions, and even persists after sintering. This capillary suspension strategy is applicable to a broad range of ma- terials including suspensions of metals, semi-conductive and ceramic oxides or glassy polymeric particles and can be easily implemented in many industrial processes since it is based on well-established unit operations. Promising fields of application include ceramic <b>foils</b> and <b>printed</b> electronic devices. status: accepte...|$|R

50|$|A {{metal foil}} is most {{commonly}} used as the conductive element of a flexible laminate. The metal foil is the material from which the circuit paths are normally etched. A wide variety of metal foils of varying thickness are available {{from which to choose}} and create a flex circuit, however copper foils, serve the vast majority of all flexible circuit applications. Copper’s excellent balance of cost and physical and electrical performance attributes make it an excellent choice. There are actually many different types of copper foil. The IPC identifies eight different types of copper <b>foil</b> for <b>printed</b> circuits divided into two much broader categories, electrodeposited and wrought, each having four sub-types.) As a result, {{there are a number of}} different types of copper foil available for flex circuit applications to serve the varied purposes of different end products. With most copper foil, a thin surface treatment is commonly applied to one side of the foil to improve its adhesion to the base film. Copper foils are of two basic types: wrought (rolled) and electrodeposited and their properties are quite different. Rolled and annealed foils are the most common choice, however thinner films which are electroplated are becoming increasingly popular.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a foil gas preconcentrator (FGP) based on a gold micro-hotplate inkjet printed on a polyimide (PI) substrate. The device is made on flexible <b>foil</b> using <b>printing</b> whereas all preconcentrators seen in literature are mainly based on rigid substrates and are micro-machined using cleanroom processes. Printing allows the additive and localized deposition of materials at low temperature on large area and {{can be applied to}} both the patterning of the heating element and the integration of the gas absorbent material. The benefits are the easy and flexible processing of cost-effective and lightweight preconcentrators for a variety of target gases. The tubular shape of the FGP is obtained by rolling up and sealing the inkjet printed gold hotplate on foil, which is then filled with the gas absorbent material (Carbopack B and Tenax). The diameter of the inlet/outlet of FGP is adjustable leading to high flow rates, up to 1. 5 L/min, much larger than their silicon counterpart. The concept was validated using four target gases (benzene, toluene, nitrobenzene and acetophenone) at concentrations down to 250 ppb. For example, the duty cycle of the FGP was reduced down 1 min and a preconcentration factor of 200 was obtained after an adsorption on Carbopack B of 250 ppb of toluene during 2 min at 1 L/min...|$|R

40|$|Laser cutting {{technology}} is now widely associated with textiles, but {{prior to the}} research of designers such as Janet Stoyel, in the early 1990 s, it {{was regarded as a}} non textile specific technology. Over the past ten years many contemporary designers have used laser technology in conjunction with textiles; leading to the widely seen ‘cut through’ design aesthetic, as exemplified by the work of product designer, Tord Boontje. The technology, however, has not been vigorously exploited and tested in conjunction with traditional textile processes such as flocking, <b>foiling,</b> and <b>print.</b> This paper discusses and discloses my recent research which investigates the use of laser cutting technology in conjunction with traditional textile design processes.

The research examines the capabilities of the technology to cut down into a surface, removing and revealing layers, structure, color and patterns within fabrics. Traditional textile design processes, such as screen and digital <b>printing,</b> flocking, <b>foiling,</b> and bonding have been used to apply color, texture or pattern to the surface and the interior of the textiles.
