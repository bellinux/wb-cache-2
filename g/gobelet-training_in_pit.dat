40|$|Underground pit {{structures}} are commonly employed by farmers for on farm storage of yam (Dioscorea spp) in Nigeria {{and other parts}} of developing world. This traditional storage structure is used without provision for adequate air exchange or ventilation. This study investigated the performance of yams stored <b>in</b> underground <b>pit</b> structures provided with air vents. Three experimental pits of similar dimensions were constructed with Pit 1 installed with one PVC vent; Pit 2 had two PVC vents and Pit 3 without vent which served as control. 20 Kg weight of yams was loaded <b>in</b> each <b>pit</b> measuring 1. 0 m in diameter and 0. 65 m in depth. The results of the study show that a lowest temperature range of 30 - 38 ºC was maintained <b>in</b> <b>pit</b> 1 (improved) temperature range of 34 - 40 ºC <b>in</b> <b>Pit</b> 2 (semi-improved) while temperature <b>in</b> <b>pit</b> 3 range from 36 - 42 ºC. The relative humidity obtained were 84, 76 and 70 % <b>in</b> <b>pit</b> 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The sprouting indexes obtained within 8 weeks storage period were 46. 2, 53. 8 and 76. 9 for pit 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The cumulative weight loss obtained <b>in</b> <b>pit</b> 1, 2 and 3 were 44. 8, 69. 5 and 79. 2 %, respectively for the 8 weeks storage period.

40|$|An {{experimental}} investigation, using 106 Colocasia esculenta (alternatively called Taro) corms, {{was conducted}} to determine the dormancy of cocoyams <b>in</b> three underground <b>pit</b> storage structures {{for a period of}} 8 weeks. The structures consisted of pit 1 with two pvc-vents which served as the improved pit, pit 2 with one vent which was regarded as a semi-improved pit and pit 3 without any vent and served as the control pit. Pit air temperatures were monitored and these varied from 27. 5 oC to 29. 4 oC with a mean of about 28. 6 oC <b>in</b> <b>pit</b> 1; and from 28. 8 oC to 30. 5 oC with a mean temperature of 29. 6 oC <b>in</b> <b>pit</b> 2 while <b>in</b> <b>pit</b> 3 the temperatures varied from 30. 0 oC to 31. 8 oC with a mean of 30. 9 oC. The relative humidities attained <b>in</b> the three <b>pits</b> were 83 %, 82. 5 % and 72 % respectively. Corms stored <b>in</b> the improved <b>pit,</b> sustained a weight loss of 1 to 11 % in 8 weeks. Sprouting <b>in</b> this <b>pit</b> started <b>in</b> the second week of storage and the sprouting index was only 34 % in 8 weeks. Corms stored <b>in</b> <b>pit</b> 2, sustained a weight loss of 1. 5 to 15 % in 8 weeks while its sprouting index was 37. 7 % <b>In</b> <b>pit</b> 3, weight loss was from 2. 5 % to 16. 1 % in the 2 months with sprouting index of 47 %. These results may be useful in providing some engineering design specifications for the storage conditions for wholesome cocoyam corms...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that species-specific pit properties such as pit membrane thickness, pit membrane porosity, torus-to-aperture diameter ratio and pit chamber depth influence xylem vulnerability to cavitation. Despite the indisputable importance of using mean pit characteristics, considerable variability <b>in</b> <b>pit</b> structure within a single species or even within a single pit field should be acknowledged. According to the rare pit hypothesis, a single pit that is more air-permeable than many neighboring pits is sufficient to allow air-seeding. Therefore, any irregularities or morphological abnormalities <b>in</b> <b>pit</b> structure allowing air-seeding should be associated with increased vulnerability to cavitation. Considering the currently proposed models of air-seeding, pit features such as rare, large pores <b>in</b> the <b>pit</b> membrane, torus extensions, and plasmodesmatal pores in a torus can represent potential glitches. These aberrations <b>in</b> <b>pit</b> structure could either result from inherent developmental flaws, or from damage caused to the pit membrane by chemical and physical agents. This suggests the existence of interesting feedbacks between abiotic and biotic stresses in xylem physiology...|$|R
