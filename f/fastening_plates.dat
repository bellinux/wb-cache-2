40|$|The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) began {{operation}} in 1967. It {{makes use of}} a unique serpentine fuel core design and a beryllium reflector. Reactor control is achieved with rotating beryllium cylinders to which have been <b>fastened</b> <b>plates</b> of hafnium. Over time, the beryllium develops rather high helium content because of nuclear transmutations and begins to swell. The beryllium must be replaced at nominally 10 -year intervals. Determination of when the replacement is made is by visual observation using a periscope to examine the beryllium surface for cracking and swelling. Disposition of the irradiated beryllium was once accomplished in the INL’s Radioactive Waste Management Complex, but {{that is no longer}} possible. Among contributing reasons are high levels of specific radioactive contaminants including transuranics. The INL is presently considering disposition pathways for this irradiated beryllium, but presently is storing it in the canal adjacent to the reactor. Numerous issues are associated with this situation including (1) Is there a need for ultra-low uranium material? (2) Is there a need to recover tritium from irradiated beryllium either because this is a strategic material resource or in preparation for disposal? (3) Is there a need to remove activation and fission products from irradiated beryllium? (4) Will there be enough material available to meet requirements for research reactors (fission and fusion) ? In this paper will be discussed the present status of considerations on these issues...|$|R

40|$|AB Objectives: Bone rivets were {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} method to <b>fasten</b> <b>plates</b> during internal fixation of fractures when screw anchorage may be inadequate. This study examined whether such rivets allow proper fracture healing without eliciting adverse bone remodelling and whether they can be removed safely. Methods: A proximal diaphyseal fracture of the tibia was stabilized with a conventional plate (low-contact dynamic compression plate, Synthes) in 10 sheep. The distal fragment was anchored using bicortical screws, and the proximal fragment (1 - 2. 5 mm thick cortex) with 3 rivets following screw stripping. Postoperative care included immediate weight bearing and biweekly radiographs. After 12 weeks, implants were removed from 6 sheep and the tibial strength measured. Tibiae with empty and filled rivet holes (at 12 and 24 weeks) were examined histologically. Results: In all sheep, secondary bone healing was observed without length and angulation deformities. All fracture gaps were bridged and filled with new bone. The average torsional strength after 12 weeks was 75 +/- 11 % of the intact tibia (mean +/- SD), and failure never occurred through an empty rivet hole. After 12 weeks, there was intensive cortical remodelling at the rivets correlating with slight to moderate nonprogressive periosteal radiolucency around 55 % of the rivets. However, there was also endosteal appositional bone growth at 85 % of the rivets. There was no observable macroscopic or microscopic osseous damage after implant removal. After 24 weeks, remodelling activity had decreased and was noted only sporadically. Conclusions: In this study, the efficacy of bone rivets for the internal fixation of a fracture with plates, where anchorage of screws may be difficult and/or insufficient, was demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|Cold-formed steel lipped channel beams (LCB) {{are used}} {{extensively}} in residential, industrial and commercial buildings as load bearing structural elements. Their shear capacities are considerably reduced when web openings are included {{for the purpose}} of locating building services. Past research has shown that the shear capacities of LCBs were reduced by up to 70 % due to the inclusion of these web openings. Hence {{there is a need to}} improve the shear capacities of LCBs with web openings. A cost effective way of eliminating the detrimental effects of large web openings is to attach suitable stiffeners around the web openings and restore the original shear strength and stiffness of LCBs. Hence detailed experimental studies were undertaken to investigate the behaviour and strength of LCBs with stiffened web openings subject to shear, and combined bending and shear actions. Both plate and stud stiffeners with varying sizes and thicknesses were attached to the web elements of LCBs using different screw-fastening arrangements. Simply supported test specimens of LCBs with aspect ratios of 1. 0 and 1. 5 were loaded at mid-span until failure. Numerical studies were also undertaken to investigate the strength of LCBs with stiffened web openings. Finite element models of LCBs with stiffened web openings under shear, combined bending and shear actions were developed to simulate the behaviour of tested LCBs. The developed models were then validated by comparing their results with experimental results and used in further studies. Both experimental and finite element analysis results showed that the stiffening arrangements recommended by past research and available design guidelines are not adequate to restore the original shear strengths of LCBs. Therefore new stiffener arrangements were proposed based on screw <b>fastened</b> <b>plate</b> stiffeners. This paper presents the details of this research study and the results...|$|R

40|$|The {{characterization}} of fatigue resistance {{is one of}} the main concerns in structural engineering, a concern that is particularly important in the evaluation of existing bridge members designed or erected before the development of fatigue design provisions. The ability of a structural member to develop alternate load paths after the failure of a component is known as member-level or internal redundancy. In fastened built-up members, these alternate load paths are affected by the combination of fastener pre-tension and friction between the structural member components in contact. In this study, a finite element methodology to model and analyze riveted and bolted built-up members was developed in ABAQUS and validated with experimental results. This methodology was used to created finite element models of three <b>fastened</b> <b>plates</b> subjected to tension, in which the middle plate had failed, in order to investigate the fundamental effects of combined fastener pre-tension and friction on their mechanical behavior. Detailed finite element models of riveted and bolted built-up flexural members were created and analyze to understand the effect of fastener pre-tension in member-level redundancy and resistance to fatigue and fracture. The obtained results showed that bolted members are able to re-distribute a larger portion of the load away from the failing component into the rest of the member than riveted members, and that this transfer of load also took place over a smaller length. Superior pre-tension of bolts, in comparison to rivets, results in larger frictional forces that develop at the contact interfaces between components and constitute additional alternate load paths that increase member-level redundancy which increase the fatigue and fracture resistance of the structural member during the failure of one of its components. Although fatigue and fracture potential may be mitigated by compressive stresses developing around the fastener hole due to fastener pre-tension, it was also observed, that at the surface of the fastener hole and at the contact interface with another plate, tensional stresses could develop; however, further computational and experimental work should be performed to verify this claim. ...|$|R

But the common race of horses had not so good fortune, being kept by farmers and carriers, and other mean people, who put them to greater labour, and fed them worse.” I described, as well as I could, our way of riding; the shape and use of a bridle, a saddle, a spur, and a whip; of harness and wheels.
