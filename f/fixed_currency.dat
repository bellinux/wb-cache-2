25|$|In 1991, Finland {{fell into}} a {{depression}} caused {{by a combination of}} economic overheating, <b>fixed</b> <b>currency,</b> depressed Western, Soviet, and local markets. Stock market and housing prices declined by 50%. The growth in the 1980s was based on debt and defaults started rolling in. GDP declined by 15% and unemployment increased from a virtual full employment to one fifth of the workforce. The crisis was amplified by trade unions' initial opposition to any reforms. Politicians struggled to cut spending and the public debt doubled to around 60% of GDP. Some 7â€“8% of GDP was needed to bail out failing banks and force banking sector consolidation. After devaluations the depression bottomed out in 1993.|$|E

50|$|From 1946 to {{the early}} 1970s, the Bretton Woods system made <b>fixed</b> <b>currencies</b> the norm; however, in 1971, the US decided no longer to uphold the dollar {{exchange}} at 1/35th of an ounce of gold, so that the currency was no longer fixed. After the 1973 Smithsonian Agreement, most of the world's currencies followed suit. However, some countries, such {{as most of the}} Gulf States, <b>fixed</b> their <b>currency</b> to the value of another currency, which has been more recently associated with slower rates of growth. When a currency floats, targets other than the exchange rate itself are used to administer monetary policy (see open-market operations).|$|R

2500|$|The 2008 {{financial}} crisis caused {{a delay in}} the schedule for adoption of the euro {{for most of the}} new EU members. The convergence progress for the newly accessed EU member states, is supported and evaluated by the yearly submission of the [...] "Convergence programme" [...] under the Stability and Growth Pact. As a general rule, the majority of economic experts recommend for newly accessed EU member states with a forecasted era of catching up and a past record of [...] "macroeconomic imbalance" [...] or [...] "financial instability", that these countries first use some years to address these issues and ensure [...] "stable convergence", before taking the next step to join the ERM-II, and as the final step (when complying with all convergence criteria) ultimately adopt the euro. In practical terms, any non-euro EU member state can become an ERM-II member whenever they want, as this mechanism does not define any criteria to comply with. Economists however consider it to be more desirable for [...] "unstable countries", to maintain their flexibility of having a floating currency, rather than getting an inflexible and partly <b>fixed</b> <b>currency</b> as an ERM-II member. Only at the time of being considered fully [...] "stable", the member states will be encouraged to enter into ERM-II, in which they need to stay for a minimum of two years without presence of [...] "severe tensions" [...] for their currency, {{while at the same time}} also ensuring compliance with the other four convergence criteria, before finally being approved to adopt the euro.|$|E

In order to determine which is the <b>fixed</b> <b>currency</b> when neither currency is on the above list (i.e. both are [...] "other"), market convention {{is to use the}} <b>fixed</b> <b>currency</b> which gives an exchange rate greater than 1.000.

There are some exceptions to this rule: for example, the Japanese often quote their currency as the base to other currencies.|$|E

50|$|A major {{incentive}} for physical restructuring arrived when the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) {{made it easier}} for manufacturers to shift production facilities from the US to Mexico. This trend later shifted to China, which offered cheap prices through very low wage rates, few workers' rights laws, a <b>fixed</b> <b>currency</b> pegged to the US dollar, (currently fixed to a basket of economies) cheap loans, cheap land, and factories for new companies, few environmental regulations, and huge economies of scale based on cities with populations over a million workers dedicated to producing a single kind of product. However, many companies are reluctant to move high value-added production of leading-edge products to China because of lax enforcement of intellectual property laws. NAFTA has increased the velocity at which physical restructuring is occurring.|$|E

In his work Free trade, GATT and the international currency system (Freihandel, GATT und das internationale WÃ¤hrungssystem. 1985) he offered an essay to redefine the benefits of free trade based on a new trade theory. In frame {{of a system of}} flexible currency rates a decision between protectionism and free trade could not be made and in addition the targeted national autonomy in monetary policy not be achieved. In his dissertation from 1988, Prices, Interest and Currency Rate, he spoke for [...] "absolutely <b>fixed</b> <b>currency</b> rates" [...] as only solution that could ensure an efficient and continuous adjustment of global economy and outer price stability. According to Flassbeck, the effects by revaluation and devaluation at flexible currency rates were equal to state interference at its descretion and as much exogenous as non-market driven changes in currency rate.|$|E
