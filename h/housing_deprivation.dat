The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze the link between housing tenure types and <b>housing</b> <b>deprivation</b> in 24 European countries. Empirical analyses are based on EU-SILC 2007, enabling comparisons of deprivation across a large set of countries. A multilevel framework is employed. Two competing hypothesis are evaluated. First, whether a rental sector targeted towards low-income households, known as social housing, is successful in achieving adequate housing standards.

40|$|The {{challenge}} of housing delivery {{in many developing}} nations is exacerbated by the predominance of deprived settlements, according to recent publications of the United Nations Settlement Programme (UN-Habitat). In Nigeria, 30 % of its urban population is currently living in Lagos megacity. The Lagos megacity region plays host to more than 200 officially recognized slum settlements. Going by the United Nations’ adopted definition, these settlements harbour households that suffer from {{lack of access to}} one or more <b>housing</b> <b>deprivation</b> measures such as durable housing, improved water, improved sanitation, sufficient living space and security of tenure. Nine major slum communities in this fast-growing megacity are presently benefiting from a massive World Bank assisted seven-year upgrading exercise that commenced in 2006. However, there is perplexity because emphasis is ostensibly on infrastructure, particularly roads. There is apparent neglect of the housing durability element. This paper argues that the approach adopted in this exercise is not exhaustive, and could in fact, portend danger for the future. The study discusses how the durability component of <b>housing</b> <b>deprivation</b> can be addressed through actions and policies that encourage ingenuous use of indigenous building materials. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Social {{factors have}} been proved to be main {{determinants}} of individuals’ health. Recent studies have also analyzed the contribution {{of some of those}} factors, such as education and job status, to socioeconomic inequalities in health. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide new evidence about the factors driving socioeconomic inequalities in health for the Spanish population by including <b>housing</b> <b>deprivation</b> and social interactions as health determinants. Methods Cross-sectional study based on the Spanish sample of European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) for 2006. The concentration index measuring income-related inequality in health is decomposed into the contribution of each determinant. Several models are estimated to test the influence of different regressors for three proxies of ill-health. Results Health inequality favouring the better-off is observed in the distribution of self-assessed health, presence of chronic diseases and presence of limiting conditions. Inequality is mainly explained, besides age, by social factors such as labour status and financial deprivation. <b>Housing</b> <b>deprivation</b> contributes to pro-rich inequality in a percentage ranging from 7. 17 % to 13. 85 %, and social interactions from 6. 16 % to 10. 19 %. The contribution of some groups of determinants significantly differs depending on the ill-health variable used. Conclusions Health inequalities can be mostly reduced or shaped by policy, as they are mainly explained by social determinants such as labour status, education and other socioeconomic conditions. The major role played on health inequality by variables taking part in social exclusion points to the need to focus on the most vulnerable groups. JEL Codes H 51, I 14, I 18 </p...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the nature of}} the housing predicaments faced by China’s urban poor since the advent of pro-ownership housing marketization in the 1990 s. It is argued that <b>housing</b> <b>deprivation</b> in today’s urban China is a complex problem which is difficult to disentangle based solely on the material outcomes of housing distribution and housing inequalities. Therefore, an integrative framework is proposed to examine the issue from the perspective of structure – agency interaction. Statistical methods are employed to identify the concrete market and nonmarket factors which constrain the housing decisions of Nanjing’s poor families, based on census and household-survey data. Qualitative interviews are then utilized to help reconstruct and interpret different storylines of homeownership transition under the identified constraints. Findings suggest that the ownership-based housing model has been promoted among the poor in exploitative ways, which has resulted in profound deprivation—for both poor owners and nonowners. Alternative, nonownership housing options are urgently needed to address the problem. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} {{evidence}} {{on the effects of}} interventions to improve housing on health. DESIGN: Systematic review of experimental and non-experimental housing intervention studies that measured quantitative health outcomes. DATA SOURCES: Studies dating from 1887, in any language or format, identified from clinical, social science, and grey literature databases, personal collections, expert consultation, and reference lists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Socioeconomic change and health, illness, and social measures. RESULTS: 18 completed primary intervention studies were identified. 11 studies were prospective, of which six had control groups. Three of the seven retrospective studies used a control group. The interventions included rehousing, refurbishment, and energy efficiency measures. Many studies showed health gains after the intervention, but the small study populations and lack of controlling for confounders limit the generalisability of these findings. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of evidence linking housing and health may be attributable to pragmatic difficulties with housing studies as well as the political climate in the United Kingdom. A holistic approach is needed that recognises the multifactorial and complex nature of poor <b>housing</b> and <b>deprivation.</b> Large scale studies that investigate the wider social context of housing interventions are required.

40|$|After {{two decades}} of {{transition}} the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States face an increasingly diverse mix {{of old and new}} policy challenges to improving child well-being and realizing children’s rights. While {{attempts have been made to}} reflect these challenges and diversities by constructing indices of child well-being which measure and rank overall performance by individual countries, this paper proposes a simplified approach which examines five different dimensions of child well-being separately, using several indicators for each dimension that allow cross-country comparison. The dimensions included in the analysis are income, health, education, <b>housing</b> and <b>deprivation</b> of parental up-bringing. The results highlight a divergence of child well-being priorities in the selected dimensions for the different countries and for different age groups of children. The analysis shows that in the 2000 - 2008 period the situation of children improved in absolute terms in almost all dimensions in all countries, but that government interventions still face difficulties in reaching all children, and that across the region there are increasing differences in the character of problems facing the more vulnerable sections of the child population. The discussion shows that it is difficult to rank countries according to an overall level of child well-being, since performance varies significantly according to the choice of dimension or indicator considered. An overall index cannot therefore capture the open challenges, and indeed may distract policy attention away from them. child poverty; child protection; child well-being; education; health; housing; transitional economies;...|$|R
40|$|Objective The aim of {{this study}} is to assess to what extent {{individual}} and area-level socioeconomic position (SEP) are associated to head and neck cancer (HNC) mortality and to what extent they contribute to regional variation in HNC mortality in Belgium. Materials and methods Data on men aged 40 – 64 are collected from a population based dataset based on the 2001 Belgian census linked to register data on emigration and mortality for 2001 – 2011. Individual SEP is measured using education, employment status and <b>housing</b> conditions. <b>Deprivation</b> at municipal level is measured by a deprivation index. Absolute mortality differences are estimated by age standardised mortality rates. Multilevel Poisson models are used to estimate the association and interaction between HNC mortality and individual and area-level SEP, and to estimate the regional variation in HNC mortality. Results HNC mortality rates are significantly higher for men with a low SEP and men living in deprived areas. Cross-level interactions indicate that the association between individual SEP and HNC mortality is conditional on area deprivation. HNC mortality in deprived areas is especially high among high-SEP men. As a result, social disparities appear to be smaller in more deprived areas. Regional variation in HNC mortality was significant. Population composition partially explains this regional variation, while area deprivation and cross-level interactions explains little. Conclusion Both individual and area-level deprivation are important determinants of HNC mortality. Underlying trends in incidence and survival, and risk factors, such as alcohol and tobacco use, should be explored further. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Indeed, evidence of decreasing cancer risks with increasing radon concentrations was observed. Adjustment for deprivation score for area of residence made little difference to this trend and similar patterns were evident in all regions and in all diagnostic groups. The study suggests that control houses had more features, such as double glazing and central heating, leading to higher radon levels than case houses.
