30|$|Suppose Nash {{equilibrium}} {{is reached}} at time t= 1. Assuming no lender may {{pull out of}} a winning bid, a borrower’s winning rate cannot worsen between time t= 1 and t= 2. Since the winning rate may not worsen, the borrower does not face any trade-off {{in terms of the}} loan-rate. It would seem obvious that a borrower should remain in the bidding process in the hope of a lower loan-rate. However, credit hungry borrowers may close the bidding process at t= 1 and the winning rate at t= 1 is the <b>final</b> <b>loan</b> rate. On the other hand, a borrower who does not close the bidding process provides an opportunity for the lenders to bid a lower rate.|$|R

25|$|A {{report to}} the Christchurch City Council meeting of 13 December 2007 gives {{the details of the}} <b>final</b> <b>loan</b> arrangements. On 19 October 2007, two Council general {{managers}} signed the loan agreement with Dairy Holdings Limited. The amount initially borrowed from Dairy Holdings Limited is $NZ1.7 million out of a maximum of $4.8 million. The law firm Anthony Harper had certified that the loan was not contrary to the Memorandum of Agreement as the resource consent applications were not used as security. However, the loan agreement grants a sub-licence from CPWL to Dairy Holdings Limited to use the CPW water consents by taking water for irrigation from the Rakaia River.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the {{so-called}} debts amortization with payments constant in real terms. In {{this kind of}} loan, the payments are increasing according to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Thus, the borrower assigns the same proportion of his/her salary to the discharge of the loan, without reducing his/her purchasing power due to this increase, but with {{the advantage of a}} minor first payment for the total amortization of the principal over the agreed loan period. We will use capitalization or discount functions with the inflation implicit and we will study the inflation rate dependence on the interest rate; taking into account that there exists a strong correlation between both magnitudes, it is expected that the <b>final</b> <b>loan</b> duration is not widely modified with respect to the initially agreed one. This work presents the theoretical treatment and some practical applications of this new proposed financial product, especially, for mortgage amortization...|$|R

50|$|Following his loan {{deal with}} Southend, Watt signed a loan deal with fellow League One side Leeds United on 25 March 2010, which {{would see him}} stay with the club {{until the end of}} the season.

5000|$|The annual Labor Day Celebration {{was started}} {{to raise money}} for {{facilities}} at the new school. Workers at Paden City Pottery and Paden City Glass gave money through payroll deduction plans to support the school. The amount workers gave may only have been $2 per week, but at a salary of $15 per week, that was a sacrifice. They did it because Paden City kids needed a school at Paden City. No state or county tax dollars were used to purchase or build the athletic field. As there was approximately a four-foot drop {{from one end of the}} property, which was to be used for an athletic field, to the other, the field had to be leveled off. A fence measuring 1,830 feet was installed, the field house was built, and bleachers were put up. It was estimated that it would take 80 months to pay the $17,300 cost of the land. In actuality the citizens of Paden City made the <b>final</b> <b>loan</b> payment in just 24 months. The light towers for the field arrived in a most unusual way. After raising $25,000 for the lights and the towers, they came by rail car to the south end of Paden City. A general call went out, and about 400 people carried the equipment, by hand, to the field. Men would work eight to ten hours a day at local industries and then work another six hours at the field to build bleachers.|$|R

2500|$|Germany, which {{up until}} the 1953 Debt {{agreement}} had {{to work on the}} assumption that all the Marshall Plan aid was to be repaid, spent its funds very carefully. Payment for Marshall Plan goods, [...] "counterpart funds", were administered by the Reconstruction Credit Institute, which used the funds for loans inside Germany. In the 1953 Debt agreement the amount of Marshall plan aid that Germany was to repay was reduced to less than 1 billion USD. This made the proportion of loans versus grants to Germany similar to that of France and the UK. The <b>final</b> German <b>loan</b> repayment was made in 1971. Since Germany chose to repay the aid debt out of the German Federal budget, leaving the German ERP fund intact, the fund was able to continue its reconstruction work.
