For example, operational amplifiers have a specified <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> rejection ratio that indicates how well the output can reject signals that appear on the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>inputs.</b> <b>Power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>inputs</b> are often noisy in large designs because the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is used by nearly every component in the design, and inductance effects prevent current from being instantaneously delivered to every component at once. As a consequence, when a component requires large injections of current (e.g., a digital component that is frequently switching from one state to another), nearby components can experience sagging at their connection to the <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> This problem can be mitigated with appropriate use of bypass capacitors connected across each <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> pin and ground. When bursts of current are required by a component, the component can bypass the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> by receiving the current directly from the nearby capacitor (which is then slowly recharged by the <b>power</b> <b>supply).</b>|$|R

The new analog driver prevents overheating of the SMA wires in an actuator by momentarily removing power when the end limit switch is closed, thereby allowing complex control schemes to be adopted without concern for overheating. Either an integral pushbutton or microprocessor-controlled gate or control line inputs switch current to the actuator until the end switch line goes from logic high to logic low state.

The WBG based converter can operate at the very high frequency and temperature making them ideal to use in harsh environments. The commercialization of WBG devices such as SiC and GaN MOSFETs has made it interesting for power engineering professionals all over the world. The use of WBG devices capable of operating at high switching frequencies reduces the overall system size dramatically with added benefit of improved power quality at high temperature.

40|$|Taming linear-regulator inrush {{currents}} Many older linear regulators and some regulators {{specifically designed for}} fast start-up require signif-icant inrush current at start-up to charge their output capac itors and to provide current to their resistive loads. The relation ship IInrush = COUT × VOUT/tRise predicts the regulator’s required input current at start-up for a given rise time, tRise, where COUT is the regulator’s output capacitance. With no inrush-control (commonly called “soft-start”) circuitry, IInrush is clamped to the regulator’s current limit, which is typically {{significantly higher than the}} regulator’s rated current. If the <b>input</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is current-limited or connected by long inductive traces, the voltage at the regulator’s input will droop, possibly below that of the regulator’s under-voltage lockout (UVLO) circuit. Figure 1 illustrates how this causes the regulator to “stair step ” or ratchet its way up to regulation, shutting down momentarily while the input capacitor recharges, then starting up again. In the past, start-up problems were common for linear regulators and can still occur when the output capacitance seen by the regulator is large. End-equipment designers need to take into account how linear regulators handle inrush current, especially if the selected regulator has no inrush-current control other than clamping to its current limit. Additional circuitry can be configured to manage inrush current for any regulator or converter. Simply by adding a FET and some passive elements following the regulator’s or converter’s output voltage, the designer can shape the FET’s turn-on characteristic and the output-voltage wave-form.

40|$|Power {{electronics}} convert {{and control}} power and are {{an essential part}} of many electronic devices and systems. Increasingly, power converters need to operate over widely varying operating conditions (voltage, current and power level), which can degrade their performance. In many applications, power converters are also being interconnected to form power systems. This is challenging as the converters may have to operate in various configurations. In order to ensure best performance, power converters and systems need to adapt to the operating conditions by adjusting topology, component values or control characteristics. In this thesis, two applications are considered: universal input power supplies and off-grid electrification. More than 3 billion power supplies were sold worldwide in 2014 [1], with efficiencies ranging from 50 - 90 % [2], which results in significant energy loss. A major portion of these are universal input power supplies (designed to operate at AC line voltages found globally). In this thesis, a control technique, Variable Frequency Multiplier (VFX), is developed which compresses the effective operating range required of a resonant converter by switching the inverter and/or rectifier operation between processing energy at a fundamental frequency and one or more harmonic frequencies. This technique was applied to the inverter stage of a stacked-bridge LLC converter for a universal <b>input</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> An efficiency of 94. 9 % to 96. 6 % was achieved for a 50 W converter operating across the entire (4 : 1) input voltage range. Even though centralized grid infrastructure is widespread, access to electricity is still limited {{in many parts of the}} developing world. More than 1. 2 billion people globally do not have access to electricity [3]. In this thesis, an ad hoc modular microgrid architecture is developed and field-tested. Contrary to how conventional power systems are designed, these microgrids do not require pre-planning and can operate in any network configuration. Smart power management units have been designed to arbitrarily connect power sources and loads, forming an autonomous microgrid. Accurate power sharing of multiple power sources is demonstrated. A methodology to attain the lowest system cost by designing power converters that reduce lifetime energy loss has also been developed. This enables affordable and reliable electricity to be provided in off-grid areas. Improvements in these applications will have a significant impact on power utilization from the existing grid infrastructure, and will help define the future of power utilization where this infrastructure does not exist. Moreover, the techniques and designs developed, in this thesis, for adaptable and efficient operation of power converters and systems can be easily extended to other applications. by Wardah Inam.

40|$|South Africa has {{the fifth}} largest coal based utility grid in the world, {{unfortunately}} many {{regions in the}} country are simply too remote for connection with this grid thus have no electricity access [1]. Many remote areas possess high wind speeds and solar irradiance exposure, which makes them ideal for Renewable Energy Systems (RES) but the electrical and economic viability of this deployment, is still in question. Based on these observations, an electrical performance analysis and economic feasibility study based on islanded RES deployment in remote areas of SA is conducted. RES growth is restricted to the effectiveness of its energy management strategy. Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) is the cheapest islanded large scale storage option but its assignment is restricted to applicable an landscape and terrain [2], [3]. After conducting a critical review, the Lead Acid Battery Storage System (BSS) and Hybrid Battery Supercapacitor Storage (HBS) were over the PHS. A theory development study on established generations systems and storage models was used to compare software designs which resulted in the selection of Matlab software for electric performance analysis and HOMER for the economic feasibility study. The electric performance analysis was divided into three case studies based on the <b>input</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> viz. ideal voltage source, Solar Photo Voltaic (PV) and Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS), with each case being connected to a BSS and HBS. A load profile and solar and wind resource investigation was conducted using the NASA, Wind Atlas of South Africa (WASA) and Solar GIS database. Electrical cases were modelled in Matlab and evaluated in terms of power security, load matching, power response and charge algorithm accuracy. The results showed that deploying an islanded RES in South Africa is indeed electrically feasible based on the high power security, load matching accuracy, and disturbance response seen in the solar-RES cases. The wind-RES maintained an uninterruptable power supply but failed to match the load as accurately. Cases which used the HBS showed improvements in power stability; load fluctuation response and an extension of storage device lifespan when compared to the BSS connected cases. This was due to the supercapacitor high power density which made it ideal for the compensation of RES and load fluctuations. Three new cases were established for the economic study as follows; solar, wind and hybrid solar-wind generation all tested under BSS and HBS conditions once again. A socio economic study established the region of deployment, natural resources, terrain, landscape as well as the price of WECS, PV, storage, and converter components. These findings were used in HOMER to construct an optimised combination of components required for the supply of a 5 MWh/d average load. This was followed by a sensitivity analysis which conducted 14 different optimisations at loads ranging from 1 - 10 MWh/d. Economic benefits of the supercapacitor power density was uncovered through a reduction of the required RES Peak Operating Reserve (POR) capacity. This is especially significant in islanded RES, as they demand large POR in order to maintain autonomous power supply. This amounted to substantial NPC savings ranging from $ 1 - $ 7. 5 million for the 25 year project. What was more interesting was the hybrid wind-solar generation results of the last case which extended total NPC savings, by up to $ 10 million. The hybrid-HBS does show some POR reductions which brought the COE to 0. 3 $/kWh on average, with the hybrid-BSS at 0. 35 $/kWh. The hybrid-BSS is slightly more expensive but has a reduced complexity which can be more inviting to project engineers therefore both hybrid cases are exceptionally feasible for local RES deployment. Single source RES is indeed electrically and economically feasible and shows extended sizing and performance benefits when implementing HBS. However, the cost reductions and performance benefits of hybrid generation make it the most practical solution to islanded RES in South Africa...|$|E

When the constrictor length of the insulated constrictor nozzle is lengthened, the elongated are in it is expanded as approching the anode terminous and the wall compression effect on the elongated arc is decreased. When the nozzle cross section is decreased, the wall compression effect is increased, and also the nozzle heat loss is increased. The local compression effect on the forced elongated arc in the insulated constrictor nozzle is investigated in three kinds of nozzle, which are the ring constrictor nozzle (R-nozzle), the injection constrictor nozzle (P-nozzle) and the magnetic compression nozzle (H-nozzle). The voltage of R-nozzle is {{higher than that of}} the insulated constrictor nozzle with the same constrictor length (C-nozzle) by 3. 9 ∿ 8. 6 V, and net arc <b>input</b> <b>power</b> of R-nozzle is 1. 2 times that of C-nozzle. The voltage of the insulated constrictor nozzle (C'-nozzle) whose constrictor length is lengthened by 6 mm is equal to R-nozzle, but the increase of the nozzle heat loss of R-nozzle is under 60 % of that of C'-nozzle. When the ratio of the injection gas flow rate to the base gas flow rate is over 1. 0 at total gas flow rate 20 l/min and 0. 7 at 30 /min, the voltage of P-nozzle is higher than that of C-nozzle. For H-nozzle, when the axial magnetic field 420 G is applied to the forced elongated arc, the electric field strength of the arc column increases by 20 %. With increasing in the arc current or the gas flow rate, the magnetic compression effect becomes notabl...|$|R
40|$|A {{high voltage}} dc {{stepping}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> for sampling a utilization device {{such as an}} electrostatic analyzer has a relatively fast settling time for voltage steps. The supply includes a waveform generator for deriving a low voltage staircase waveform that feeds a relatively long response time <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> deriving a high output voltage generally equal to a predetermined multiple of the input voltage. In the <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> an ac voltage modulated by the staircase waveform is applied to a step-up transformer {{and then to a}} voltage multiplier stack to form a high voltage, relatively poor replica of the input waveform at an intermediate output terminal.

When a digitally controlled PFC is utilized at {{the front end of}} the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> much if not all the information necessary to calculate the <b>input</b> <b>power</b> has already been sensed as digital control data. This paper investigates <b>input</b> <b>power</b> measurement techniques that use data already available from the digital PFC controller or downstream DC-DC controllers.
