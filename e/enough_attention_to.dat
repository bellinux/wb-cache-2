5|$|Milk {{abruptly}} {{stopped working}} as an insurance actuary and became {{a researcher at the}} Wall Street firm Bache & Company. He was frequently promoted despite his tendency to offend the older members of the firm by ignoring their advice and flaunting his success. Although he was skilled at his job, co-workers sensed that Milk's heart was not in his work. He started a romantic relationship with Jack Galen McKinley, and recruited him to work on conservative Republican Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign. Their relationship was troubled. When McKinley first began his relationship with Milk in late 1964, he was 16 years old. He was prone to depression and sometimes threatened to commit suicide if Milk did not show him <b>enough</b> <b>attention.</b> <b>To</b> make a point to McKinley, Milk took him to the hospital where Milk's ex-lover, Joe Campbell, was himself recuperating from a suicide attempt, after his lover Billy Sipple left him. Milk had remained friendly with Campbell, who had entered the avant-garde art scene in Greenwich Village, but Milk did not understand why Campbell's despondency was sufficient cause to consider suicide as an option.|$|E

30|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{characterizations of}} the oscillation source {{have not been}} paid <b>enough</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> so far. Different methods use different criteria to characterize their sources. For instance, damping torque based methods characterize the source by the generator with a negative damping torque coefficient, and the energy based methods characterize the source as the generator producing dissipating energy. However, we cannot prove that the generator having positive damping torque coefficient {{will never be the}} oscillation source in any way, so the damping torque based methods may possibly give wrong location results [33]. A similar conclusion holds for other methods.|$|R

These events could have imparted valuable pointers to the Bush Administration such as the notion that terrorism tactics used by insurgency operations including guerrilla warfare were difficult to defeat effectively, {{even in the face of}} overwhelming U.S. military forces.|$|E
25|$|Even {{as a young}} boy, Ryelandt had a mind of his own. Much as he revered his “best piano teacher,” Franz Devos (of the Ghent Conservatory) {{who gave}} him private lessons, he wrote that Devos “did not pay <b>enough</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> technique, which left me unsatisfied.” While he {{learned a lot from}} Tinel, whose {{technical}} mastery he greatly admired, he also let himself be influenced by Wagner, whom Tinel detested, and by French composers such as Franck, Fauré and Debussy, whereas Tinel was primarily German-oriented. But Ryelandt never belonged to any school or fashion; in fact, he despised fashion.|$|E

25|$|His {{exploits}} in {{his single}} season gained him <b>enough</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> {{be brought in}} as the opening batsman for the MCC in 2005 season's opener against County Champions Warwickshire. With a century in the first innings and a near attempt at 97 in the second, Cook helped secure victory in a match destined for a draw. The season opener would not be Cook's only highlight for the year, as the Ashes approached Australia were touring the counties and in a two-day match which did not count towards his first-class statistics, Cook scored a double century went on {{to take the first}} wicket of Justin Langer with a catch in the drawn match days after being awarded PCA Young Cricketer of the Year. A further highlight of the season saw Cook help Essex to score one of Durham's two defeats of the season, scoring 107 of Essex's 245 before taking his maiden first-class wicket, before taking another two, with his off-spin. Cook played in every first-class match for Essex and also helped them clinch the Totesport League Title {{for the first time in}} 20 years. The end of the season saw Cook finish with an average of 48.03 in the County Championship, hitting four centuries.|$|E

500|$|Literary critic Claudia Sadowski-Smith {{has called}} Cisneros [...] "perhaps {{the most famous}} Chicana writer", and Cisneros has been {{acknowledged}} as a pioneer in her literary field as the first female Mexican-American writer to have her work published by a mainstream publisher. In 1989, The House on Mango Street, which was originally published by the small Hispanic publishing company Arte Público Press, was reissued in a second edition by Vintage Press; and in 1991 Woman Hollering Creek was published by Random House. As Ganz observes, previously only male Chicano authors had successfully made the crossover from smaller publishers. That Cisneros had garnered <b>enough</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> be taken on by Vintage Press said {{a lot about the}} possibility for Chicano literature to become more widely recognized.

500|$|Mackinolty's {{position}} was redesignated Director of Equipment in April 1935. At around this time, he collaborated with Squadron Leader George Jones, then Director of Training, on {{an investigation into}} the state of aircraft production in Australia to highlight shortfalls in local defence in the face of possible future conflict with Japan. [...] Though the report was reviewed enthusiastically by the Air Member for Personnel, Wing Commander Bill Anderson, it apparently went no further in the chain of command and thus was effectively ignored. Raised to squadron leader, Mackinolty was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the Coronation Honours on 11May 1937, in recognition of his achievements in stores and accounting. In February the following year he was promoted to [...] wing commander. The punctilious Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Richard Williams, sometimes complained that Mackinolty did not pay <b>enough</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> his personal appearance, but never failed to acknowledge his [...] "professional excellence".|$|E
40|$|AbstractDue to the popularization {{of mobile}} phones, many people search Web {{contents}} {{using their own}} mobile phones. Since people bring their mobile phones everywhere, they can search Web contents in various situations (e. g., walking and sitting). In particular, when users are walking, they cannot pay <b>enough</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> operate their devices {{and it is difficult}} to conduct complicated operations such as character inputting. In addition, users’ search objectives are also affected by the time and their location. To assist content search in such situations, in this paper, we propose a content search support system that presents a few options that enable mobile users to get desired contents easily considering the users’ situations. The system infers users’ situation based on sensory data and presents initial options considering users’ search objective corresponding to the inferred situation. Through a user experiment, we confirmed that participants could get desired information easily by using our system and it was effective to adaptively present options based on the inferred situations...|$|R
40|$|Resource {{management}} has been recognised {{as an important}} topic for the execution of business processes since long time ago. Yet, most exiting works on resource allocation have not paid <b>enough</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> process characteristics, such as structural and task dependencies. Furthermore, no effort has been made on optimising resource allocation by improving business processes. To address this issue, we propose an approach that optimises the use of resources in an enterprise by exploring the structural features of a business process and adapting the structures of the business process to better fit the resources available in the enterprise. After a motivating example, we describe a role-based business process model for resource allocation. Then we present strategies for resource allocation optimisation and discuss the relationship between resource allocation and business process improvement. A set of heuristic rules are discussed and algorithms based on these rules are designed for optimising resource allocation with a particular optimisation goal...|$|R

500|$|The court {{made several}} findings, {{including}} that Waddle {{failed to take}} positive action {{in response to the}} non-availability of the AVSDU, nine of the 13 watchstations in and around the control room were manned by substitute personnel, and that one of the sonar operators was unqualified to stand watch. The court also issued numerous opinions, including that the accident was caused by [...] "a series and combination of individual negligence(s) onboard Greeneville," [...] "artificial urgency" [...] by Waddle to rush the submarine through its demonstration schedule as it began to run late, failure to follow standard procedures, the abbreviated periscope search, distractions and obstruction caused by the presence of the civilian guests, crew training deficiencies, overconfidence and complacency, and Waddle's not paying <b>enough</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> ship contact information. [...] The court found that, although Brandhuber was the senior officer present on Greeneville, Waddle as captain was solely responsible for the safe navigation of the submarine. [...] The inquiry report went into great detail on the purpose and rules surrounding the USN's DVE program.|$|E
500|$|On a {{traditional}} view, {{after the death}} of the cautious López I, his son paid not <b>enough</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> his father's dying words: to try to settle disputes with Brazil with the pen not the sword.

[...] According to the American ambassador to Paraguay Charles A. Washburn, Lopez explained his seizure of the Brazilian ship by saying [...] "with more candor than discretion" [...] that only by a war could the attention and respect of the world be secured to Paraguay; that although Paraguay was a small power in comparison with Brazil, she had [...] "advantages of position" [...] that gave her an equality of strength; and that the Paraguayan troops would be already [...] "fortified and intrenched" [...] before the Brazilians could arrive in any considerable numbers.|$|E
