5|$|During the 1947 royal tour of South Africa, Elizabeth's serene public {{behaviour}} was broken, exceptionally, {{when she}} {{rose from the}} royal car to strike an admirer with her umbrella because she had mistaken his enthusiasm for hostility. The 1948 royal tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed because of the King's declining health. In March 1949, he had a successful operation to improve the circulation in his right leg. In summer 1951, Queen <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>and</b> her daughters fulfilled the King's public engagements in his place. In September, {{he was diagnosed with}} lung cancer. After a lung resection, he appeared to recover, but the delayed trip to Australia and New Zealand was altered so that Princess <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>and</b> her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, went in the King and Queen's place, in January 1952. The King died while Princess <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>and</b> the Duke were in Kenya en route to the southern hemisphere, and they returned immediately to London. They would not finally visit Australia and New Zealand until 1954.|$|E
