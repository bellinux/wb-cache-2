40|$|The bag <b>of</b> a <b>trawlnet</b> is {{considered}} as an elliptical cone, its wings as merely forward extensions of this cone. The {{dimensions of the}} cone are derived from the measured wingend spread and the headline height (gape) of the net and from its specification drawings. From these operational and constructional dimensions the mean angle of attack of the netting panels and the mean setting angle of the meshes are derived. All operational dimensions change with towing speed. Formulae are then given which with further inputs of twine diameter bar length and developed area of each netting panel allow {{an estimate of the}} drag area of the netting cone. The codend {{in the form of a}} tube, the net appendages and the ground friction are eachconsidered separately. Thus a total drag area is derived; multiplication by the hydrodynamic pressure and addition of the friction give the total geometrically derived drag <b>of</b> the <b>trawlnet.</b> This is compared with the measured drag over a range of speeds for 3 very different bottom drawls and two substantially different midwater trawls. Examples of the comparisons are presented. The method provides a means of predicting change <b>of</b> <b>trawlnet</b> drag with change of shape...|$|R

5000|$|The Pre-Depression Era:Though {{this novel}} was written during the Great Depression, the main {{plot of the}} story takes place during the 1920s. Though the themes of the great {{depression}} are visible in the family’s struggles and tribulations, as Burkom and Williams put it, Yonnondio actually represents the 1920s more realistically than The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald which shows the life <b>of</b> the stereotypical <b>flappers</b> <b>of</b> the time. By exploring the lives of the working class, the novel portrays a “realistic depiction of the squalid conditions in which the unknown of America’s working class miraculously endure." [...] Had the novel been completed, it would have more precisely represented the depression era via the characters planned involvement in the proletarian movement.|$|R
5000|$|Kahlo {{was a big}} {{supporter}} of the Mexican Revolution, {{so much so that}} she attempted to change her birth date to correspond with the beginning of the Revolution in 1910. At the onset of this movement, a so-called “cult of Mexican femininity” gained popularity, which Jolie Olcott describes as “selflessness, martyrdom, self-sacrifice, an erasure of self and the negation of one’s outward existence.” In rejection of this limited conception of femininity, Kahlo fashioned herself as a Mexican counterpart to the <b>flappers</b> <b>of</b> the United States and Europe in the 1920s. Later, inspired by Rivera’s concept of Mexicanidad, a passionate identification with Mexican pre-Hispanic indigenous roots, she donned the identity of the Tehuana woman. The Tehuana {{had a great deal of}} equality with their male Zapotec counterparts and represented strength, sensuality, and exoticism.|$|R

5000|$|Mods {{also are}} {{a great example of}} a youth culture {{movement}} inspiring a popular lifestyle. Similar to the flappers, they also emerged during a time of war and political and social troubles. They were a group of kids that stemmed from a group called the modernists. The Mods were {{young men and women who}} came from all classes, and they believed that their fashion choices [...] "gave them entrée everywhere," [...] and their fashion choices empowered them. The women's fashions were short and reflected an ideal, youthful body unforgiving to women with curves. They also cut their hair short, possibly a [...] "homage to the <b>flappers</b> <b>of</b> the 1920's." [...] The Mod style and embrace of modern technology spread from the UK overseas to America as well as other countries, proving it to be an extremely influential youth culture movement.|$|R
40|$|Social {{commentators}} typically {{recognized the}} flapper as {{a break from}} tradition in the nineteen twenties. Scholars have since tended to do the same.

5000|$|The epithet was {{popularized by}} the {{vaudeville}} act of George Burns and his wife, Gracie Allen, but was in use earlier. In 1924 it {{was turned into}} a comic strip drawn by Chic Young (of later Blondie fame) and produced by King Features Syndicate. Although Young's Dora was uneducated, she was also capable of persuading people around her to let her get her own way. This frequently resulted in the strip ending with a character saying of Dora [...] "She ain't so dumb!" [...] After Young left the strip to create Blondie, Paul Fung took over Dumb Dora. Fung also added a topper strip to Dumb Dora, When Mother was a Girl. [...] Although this strip was discontinued in 1935, the TV game show Match Game occasionally alluded to the strip by asking those watching in the studio to shout in unison, [...] "How dumb is she?" [...] (borrowing from a routine from The Tonight Show). <b>Flappers</b> <b>of</b> the 1920s were also sometimes likened to dumb Doras.|$|R

2500|$|Flappers' {{behavior}} was considered outlandish {{at the time}} and redefined women's roles. In the English media they were stereotyped as pleasure-loving, reckless and prone to defy convention by initiating sexual relationships. Some have suggested that the flapper concept as a stage of life particular to young women was imported to England from Germany, where it originated [...] "as a sexual reaction against the over-fed, under-exercised monumental woman, and as a compromise between pederasty and normal sex". In Germany teenage girls were called [...] "Backfisch", which meant a young fish not yet big enough to be sold in the market. [...] Although the concept of [...] "Backfisch" [...] was known in England by the late 1880s, the term was understood to mean a very demure social type unlike the flapper, who was typically rebellious and defiant of convention. The evolving image <b>of</b> <b>flappers</b> was <b>of</b> independent young women who went by night to jazz clubs such as those in Harlem, which were viewed as erotic and dangerous, where they danced provocatively, smoked cigarettes and dated freely, perhaps indiscriminately. [...] They were active, sporting, rode bicycles, drove cars, and openly drank alcohol, a defiant act in the American period of Prohibition. With time came the development of dance styles such as the Charleston, the Shimmy, the Bunny Hug, and the Black Bottom, which were considered shocking, but were a symbolic badge <b>of</b> the <b>flapper's</b> rejection <b>of</b> traditional standards.|$|R

Just as Billee and Phoebe are about to wed, Captain Flapper sees Phoebe and falls in love with her at first sight, vowing to marry her himself. A tutor, Christopher Crab is also in love with Phoebe. A sailor, Ben Barnacle, has gone to sea to forget about Eliza, whom he loves but who does not love him. To stop the marriage, Captain Flapper orders Ben to abduct Billee and impress him as a seaman, which he does. Phoebe and her classmates at the charity school all decide to disguise themselves as men and join the Navy.|$|R

6000|$|It was {{wonderful}} what a change {{the next few}} days made in dear old Bobbie. Have you ever seen that picture, [...] "The Soul's Awakening"? It represents a <b>flapper</b> <b>of</b> sorts gazing in a startled sort of way into the middle distance with a look in her eyes that seems to say, [...] "Surely that is George's step I hear on the mat! Can this be love?" [...] Well, Bobbie had a soul's awakening too. I don't suppose he had ever troubled to think in his life before--not really think. But now he was wearing his brain to the bone. It was painful in a way, of course, to see a fellow human being so thoroughly in the soup, but I felt strongly that it was all for the best. I could see as plainly as possible that all these brainstorms were improving Bobbie out of knowledge. When it was all over he might possibly become a rotter again of a sort, but it would only be a pale reflection of the rotter he had been. It bore out the idea I had always had that what he needed was a real good jolt.|$|R
60|$|Strange, is it not, {{that the}} Porpoise should {{have in this}} queer-looking affair--its flapper (as it is called), the same {{fundamental}} elements as the fore-leg of the Horse or the Dog, or the Ape or Man; and here you will notice a very curious thing,--the hinder limbs are absent. Now, let us make another jump. Let us go to the Codfish: here you see is the forearm, in this large pectoral fin--carrying your mind's eye onward from the <b>flapper</b> <b>of</b> the Porpoise. And here you have the hinder limbs restored {{in the shape of}} these ventral fins. If I were to make a transverse section of this, I should find just the same organs that we have before noticed. So that, you see, there comes out this strange conclusion as the result of our investigations, that the Horse, when examined and compared with other animals, is found by no means to stand alone in nature; but that there are an enormous number of other creatures which have backbones, ribs, and legs, and other parts arranged in the same general manner, and in all their formation exhibiting the same broad peculiarities.|$|R

In this paper, the current source inverter-induction motor system for trawl winch is designed and tested.
