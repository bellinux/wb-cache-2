This helped Preston reach the 2005 Championship play-off Final, where they were beaten 1–0 by West Ham United at the Millennium Stadium. Cresswell played poorly in the first half, but had a number of chances on goal during the second half.|$|E
500|$|A {{month after}} the disappearance, Malaysia Airlines' chief {{executive}} Ahmad Jauhari Yahya acknowledged that ticket sales had declined but failed to provide specific details. This may have partially resulted from the suspension of the airline's advertising campaigns following the disappearance. Ahmad stated {{in an interview with}} the Wall Street Journal that the airline's [...] "primary focus...is that we do take care of the families in terms of their emotional needs and also their financial needs. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> provide answers for them. It is important that the world has answers, as well." [...] In further remarks, Ahmad said he was not sure when the airline could start repairing its image, but that the airline was adequately insured to cover the financial loss stemming from Flight 370's disappearance. In China, where the majority of passengers were from, bookings on Malaysia Airlines were down 60 percent in March.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{many writers}} looked to photography, film, and {{audiotape}} recordings {{in order to}} discover new ideas about composing. [...] This led to a resurgence of {{a focus on the}} sensory, self-illustration known as expressionism. Expressionist ways of thinking encouraged writers to find their voice outside of language by placing it in a visual, oral, spatial, or temporal medium. Donald Murray, who is often linked to expressionist methods of teaching writing once said, “As writers it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> move out from that which is within us to what we see, feel, hear, smell, and taste of the world around us. A writer is always making use of experience.” Murray instructed his writing students to “see themselves as cameras” by writing down every single visual observation they made for one hour. [...] Expressionist thought emphasized personal growth, and linked the art of writing with all visual art by calling both a type of composition. Also, by making writing the result of a sensory experience, expressionists defined writing as a multisensory experience, and asked for it to have the freedom to be composed across all modes, tailored for all five senses.|$|E

2500|$|On 6 January 2011, Secretary of Defense Gates made {{a speech}} on the U.S. defense budget for FY 2012, which {{announced}} major investment in developing a long-range, nuclear-capable bomber, also to be optionally remotely piloted. He also said the aircraft [...] "will be designed and developed using proven technologies, an approach that should {{make it possible to}} deliver this capability on schedule and in quantity. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> begin this project now to ensure that a new bomber can be ready before the current aging fleet goes out of service. The follow on bomber represents a key component of a joint portfolio of conventional deep-strike capabilities—an area that should be a high priority for future defense investment given the anti-access challenges our military faces." [...] In July 2011, Joint Chief Vice Chairman James Cartwright called for a large UAV instead of a manned aircraft, including for the nuclear mission. Retired Air Force colonel and Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments analyst Mark Gunzinger has called for an optionally manned bomber, stating that purely unmanned bombers would be at a disadvantage without direct human pilot awareness and vulnerable to communication disruption.|$|E

According to Sanders's close friend Richard Sugarman, a professor of religious studies at the University of Vermont, Sanders's Jewish identity is [...] "certainly more ethnic and cultural than religious". Deborah Dash Moore, a Judaic scholar at the University of Michigan, has said that Sanders has a particular type of [...] "ethnic Jewishness" [...] that is somewhat old-fashioned.
