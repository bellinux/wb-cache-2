5|$|Allen and {{his family}} moved to Burlington in 1787, which was no longer a small {{frontier}} settlement but a small town, and much more to Allen's liking than the larger community that Bennington had become. He frequented the tavern there, and began work on An Essay on the Universal Plenitude of Being, which he characterized as an appendix to Reason. This <b>essay</b> <b>was</b> less polemic than many of his earlier writings. He affirmed the perfection of God and His creation, and credited intuition as well as reason as a way to bring Man closer to the universe. The work was not published until long after his death, and is primarily of interest to students of Transcendentalism, a movement the work foreshadows.|$|E

40|$|This <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> {{offered for}} {{publication}} by prof. Dimiter Klissurski, actual {{member of the}} Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.

5000|$|All the <b>essays</b> <b>were</b> {{published}} {{under the}} byline [...] "Idler". They {{were not given}} titles until they were published in book form.

5|$|The <b>essay</b> <b>was</b> {{extensively}} {{discussed in}} the media and the blogosphere, with reactions to Carr's argument being polarised. At the Britannica Blog, a part of the discussion focused on the apparent bias in Carr's argument toward literary reading. In Carr's view, reading on the Internet is generally a shallower form in comparison with reading from printed books in which he believes a more intense and sustained form of reading is exercised. Elsewhere in the media, the Internet's impact on memory retention was discussed; and, at the online scientific magazine Edge, several argued that it was ultimately the responsibility of individuals to monitor their Internet usage so that it does not impact their cognition.|$|E
5|$|Freedom from Want was {{published}} with an essay by Carlos Bulosan {{as part of}} the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The <b>essay</b> <b>was</b> lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.|$|E

5000|$|An <b>essay</b> <b>is,</b> generally, a {{piece of}} writing that gives the author's own {{argument}} — but the definition is vague, overlapping with those of an article, a pamphlet, and a short story. <b>Essays</b> have traditionally <b>been</b> sub-classified as formal and informal. Formal <b>essays</b> <b>are</b> characterized by [...] "serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length," [...] whereas the informal <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> characterized by [...] "the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme," [...] etc.|$|R
50|$|The <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> {{significant}} {{because it contains}} Tolkien's explanation of his philosophy on fantasy and thoughts on mythopoiesis. Moreover, the <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> an early analysis of speculative fiction {{by one of the}} most important authors in the genre.|$|R
40|$|This {{creative}} nonfiction <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> {{an excerpt}} from a book length study that I have recently completed on the seasons. My manuscript {{was inspired by the}} Medieval Book of Hours, particularly its Labours of the Months calendar. This <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> a portrait of November. My setting is northeastern Nova Scotia, where the Medieval model of agrarian labour is still remarkably preserved. The <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> also a reflection on time: the rhythmic, seasonal flow that counters the accelerated pace of modern, urbanized life...|$|R

25|$|Although {{originally}} published anonymously, when the <b>essay</b> <b>was</b> republished 19 years later, in 1869, {{the concept of}} the corrupting Jew had become so widely held that Wagner's name was affixed to it.|$|E
25|$|The <b>essay</b> <b>was</b> {{omitted from}} the 'complete' edition of Wagner's prose works issued in 1983 on the centenary of his death, because of its {{perceived}} link with Nazi antisemitism.

25|$|The early {{evolution}} of fishing as recreation is not clear. For example, there is anecdotal evidence for fly fishing in Japan, however, fly fishing {{was likely to}} have been a means of survival, rather than recreation. The earliest English essay on recreational fishing was published in 1496, by Dame Juliana Berners, the prioress of the Benedictine Sopwell Nunnery. The <b>essay</b> <b>was</b> titled Treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an Angle, and included detailed information on fishing waters, the construction of rods and lines, and the use of natural baits and artificial flies.|$|E

The movement had been gathering strength for some years, having been founded by Quakers both in Britain and in the United States, with support from other nonconformists, primarily Methodists and Baptists, {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. In 1783, 300 Quakers, chiefly from the London area, presented Parliament with their signatures on the first petition against the slave trade.|$|E

In 1953, Hynek was an associate member of the Robertson Panel, which concluded that there was nothing anomalous about UFOs, and that a public relations campaign should be undertaken to debunk the subject and reduce public interest. Hynek would later lament that the Robertson Panel had helped make UFOs a disreputable field of study.|$|E
