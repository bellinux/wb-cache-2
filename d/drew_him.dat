5|$|Although Johnson was {{recruited}} by several top-ranked colleges such as Indiana and UCLA, {{he decided to}} play close to home. His college decision came down to Michigan and Michigan State in East Lansing. He ultimately decided to attend Michigan State when coach Jud Heathcote {{told him he could}} play the point guard position. The talent already on Michigan State's roster also <b>drew</b> <b>him</b> to the program.|$|E
5|$|His career {{stalled in}} the 1970s because {{he refused to}} swear {{allegiance}} to the Romanian Communist Party and was forced out of academia for his sympathies towards Israel. When Librescu requested permission to emigrate to Israel, the Academy of Science of Romania fired him. In 1976, a smuggled research manuscript that he had published in the Netherlands <b>drew</b> <b>him</b> international attention in the growing field of material dynamics.|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{the episode}} Larry makes {{frequent}} countertop appearances and grows increasingly discouraged {{that they have}} not <b>drawn</b> <b>him</b> yet. Eventually he announces that he is leaving, but, dressed in a cowboy hat and bandanna, Tim Hodge has the idea to <b>draw</b> <b>him</b> at last in Larry's role as Little Joe from The Ballad of Little Joe.|$|R

60|$|Her {{hands were}} <b>drawing</b> <b>him,</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>him</b> down to her. He was afraid, {{even a little}} horrified. For he had, really, no {{intention}} of loving her. Yet her hands were <b>drawing</b> <b>him</b> towards her. He put out his hand quickly to steady himself, and grasped her bare shoulder. A flame seemed to burn the hand that grasped her soft shoulder. He {{had no intention of}} loving her: his whole will was against his yielding. It was horrible. And yet wonderful was the touch of her shoulders, beautiful the shining of her face. Was she perhaps mad? He had a horror of yielding to her. Yet something in him ached also.|$|R
5|$|Salih {{established}} a well-organized administration over his Aleppo-based domains. Militarily, he {{relied on the}} Banu Kilab, while entrusting fiscal administration to his local Christian vizier, policing to an urban militia commander and judicial matters to a Shia Muslim qāḍī. His rule was officially tolerated by the Fatimids, to whom he paid formal allegiance. However, his alliance with the Banu Tayy ultimately <b>drew</b> <b>him</b> into conflict with the Fatimid general, Anushtakin al-Dizbari, whose forces killed Salih in battle near Lake Tiberias. Salih was succeeded by his sons Thimal and Nasr.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his life}} Whorf was a {{chemical}} engineer by profession, {{but as a}} young man he took up an interest in linguistics. At first this interest <b>drew</b> <b>him</b> to the study of Biblical Hebrew, but he quickly went on to study the indigenous languages of Mesoamerica on his own. Professional scholars were impressed by his work and in 1930 he received a grant to study the Nahuatl language in Mexico; on his return home he presented several influential papers on the language at linguistics conferences.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Walton's {{relationship}} with the Sitwells became less close. He had love affairs and new friendships that <b>drew</b> <b>him</b> out of their orbit. His first long affair was with Imma von Doernberg, the young widow of a German baron. She and Walton met in the late 1920s and they were together until 1934, when she left him. His later affair with Alice, Viscountess Wimborne (born 1880), which lasted from 1934 until her death in April 1948, caused a wider breach between Walton and the Sitwells, as she disliked {{them as much as}} they disliked her. By the 1930s, Walton was earning enough from composing to allow him financial independence for the first time. A legacy from a musical benefactress in 1931 further enhanced his finances, and in 1934 he left the Sitwells' house and bought a house in Belgravia.|$|E

60|$|The {{shame of}} the {{situation}} for him was increasingly annoying, inasmuch as this lovely girl should stoop to flirtation with a stranger, and the same time <b>draw</b> <b>him,</b> allure him, despite the apparent insincerity.|$|R

5|$|When Constantine {{returned}} to Trinidad in late 1954, {{he found a}} growing desire for independence from Britain. At Trinidad Leaseholds he felt isolated from other, mainly white, senior staff; this <b>drew</b> <b>him</b> towards political involvement. Eric Williams, leader of the newly founded People's National Movement (PNM), was aware of Constantine's popular appeal and recruited him. By January 1956 Constantine, with the full co-operation and blessing of his employers, was party chairman {{and a member of}} its executive committee. Feeling that the PNM's policies were in harmony with his views on improving the lives of black people, and encouraged by his wife, Constantine stood for election in the parliamentary constituency of Tunapuna in 1956. He won a narrow victory, which his colleagues believed few in the party could have done, and resigned from Trinidad Leaseholds. The PNM formed a government, in which Constantine became the Minister of Communications, Works and Utilities.|$|E
5|$|His next {{activity}} was the 2016 Davis Cup semifinal in Glasgow against Argentina. He lost the opening rubber against Juan Martín del Potro in five sets. After Great Britain lost the second rubber as well, he {{teamed up with}} his brother Jamie to beat del Potro and Leonardo Mayer in the third rubber in four sets. He then won the fourth rubber against Guido Pella in straight sets, though Great Britain eventually lost the tie. Murray then won the China Open for his fifth title of 2016 and 40th career tour title. He defeated Andreas Seppi, Andrey Kuznetsov, Kyle Edmund, David Ferrer, and Grigor Dimitrov all in straight sets. Murray then backed this up with a tournament win at the Shanghai Rolex Masters defeating Steve Johnson, Lucas Pouille, David Goffin, Gilles Simon, and Roberto Bautista Agut all in straight sets to capture his 13th masters title and 3rd title in Shanghai. This marked his 6th title of 2016 and <b>drew</b> <b>him</b> even with former No. 1 Stefan Edberg at No. 15 on the Open Era titles list with 41 Tour titles each.|$|E
5|$|Rajoelina's {{business}} affairs gradually <b>drew</b> <b>him</b> {{into the}} political arena. Shortly after Ravalomanana won the presidential elections in 2001, Rajoelina befriended the new president's daughter and continued to expand {{his relationship with the}} capital's political elite {{over the course of the}} Ravalomanana presidency. He assumed an increasingly political role after the policies of Ravalomanana's Tiako I Madagasikara (TIM)-dominated government increasingly obstructed the expansion of his business activities, such as requiring the removal of Antananarivo's first LED advertising panels, which Rajoelina had installed at a major roundabout in the capital. In May 2007 he purchased the Ravinala television and radio stations, which he renamed Viva TV and Viva FM. The official launch of these newly acquired media channels on 27 May was attended by many of the capital's political and cultural elite, including Antananarivo mayor Hery Rafalimanana and Jacques Sylla, president of the TIM political party. Rajoelina used these media channels as outlets for voicing criticism of the Ravalomanana administration, quickly transforming his public image into that of an opposition leader.|$|E

5|$|The novel's protagonist is Lucius, {{a man who}} {{has been}} magically {{transformed}} into a donkey. In the eleventh and last book of the novel, Lucius, after falling asleep on the beach at Cenchreae in Greece, wakes to see the full moon. He prays to the moon, using the names of several moon goddesses known in the Greco-Roman world, asking her to restore him to human form. Isis appears in a vision before Lucius and declares herself the greatest of all goddesses. She tells him that a festival in her honor, the Navigium Isidis, is taking place nearby, and that the festival procession carries with it garlands of roses that will restore his human form if he eats them. After Lucius becomes human again, the high priest at the festival declares that he has been saved from his misfortunes by the goddess, and that he will now be free of the inquisitiveness and self-indulgence that <b>drew</b> <b>him</b> into many of his earlier misadventures. Lucius joins the local temple of Isis, becomes her devoted follower, and eventually undergoes initiation.|$|E

25|$|The quirky {{music video}} {{for the song}} and several others from this album {{received}} significant airplay on the upstart MTV. A notable feature of the video was dancer Craig Allen Rothwell, known as Spazz Attack, whose signature dance move, a forward flip onto his back, <b>drew</b> <b>him</b> significant attention.|$|E

25|$|The {{study of}} natural {{philosophy}} (what {{we would call}} science) <b>drew</b> <b>him</b> into overlapping circles of acquaintance. Franklin was, for example, a corresponding member of the Lunar Society of Birmingham, which included such other scientific and industrial luminaries as Matthew Boulton, James Watt, Josiah Wedgwood and Erasmus Darwin; on occasion he visited them.|$|E
25|$|Crowley's special {{capacity}} for smoothing troubled waters <b>drew</b> <b>him</b> closer to FDR. A wartime cabinet-level conflict involving foreign economic operations in Europe and North Africa threatened cabinet solidarity. So Crowley became {{head of the}} Foreign Economic Administration in September 1943, with responsibility for Lend-Lease and Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., was promoted to Undersecretary of State. Crowley was now a cabinet member in the Roosevelt administration.|$|E
25|$|He became {{fascinated with}} arcade {{games as a}} teenager, though his parents thought him a delinquent for this pastime. He {{particularly}} enjoyed playing Taito's Space Invaders, which <b>drew</b> <b>him</b> into other video games. His interest eventually evolved into attempting to plan his own games. He took his Famicom apart {{to see how it}} worked, and won a contest for a video game idea sponsored by Sega.|$|E

25|$|He {{became friends}} with the Impressionists Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Paul Cézanne and Camille Pissarro through another painter, Berthe Morisot, {{who was a member}} of the group and <b>drew</b> <b>him</b> into their activities. The grand niece of the painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Morisot had her first {{painting}} accepted in the Salon de Paris in 1864, and she continued to show in the salon for the next ten years.|$|E
25|$|Hayek {{served in}} World War I {{and said that}} his {{experience}} in the war and his desire to help avoid the mistakes that had led to the war <b>drew</b> <b>him</b> into economics. Hayek lived in Austria, Great Britain, the United States, and Germany and became a British subject in 1938. He {{spent most of his}} academic life at the London School of Economics (LSE), the University of Chicago, and the University of Freiburg.|$|E
25|$|It was Thomas' {{position}} as a conscientious objector which <b>drew</b> <b>him</b> to the Socialist Party of America (SPA), a staunchly antimilitarist organization. When SPA leader Morris Hillquit made his campaign for Mayor of New York in 1917 on an anti-war platform, Thomas wrote to him expressing his good wishes. To his surprise, Hillquit wrote back, encouraging the young minister to work for his campaign, which Thomas energetically did. Soon thereafter he himself joined the Socialist Party. Thomas was a Christian socialist.|$|E
