40|$|<b>Granulocytes</b> {{from human}} {{peripheral}} blood were co-cultured with conventional dendritic cells (cDC) or plasmacytoid DCs (pDC) {{to examine the}} effects of DCs on the activation or function of <b>granulocytes.</b> After co-culture of <b>granulocytes</b> with DCs, expression of the activation markers of <b>granulocytes</b> (CD 63 and CD 64) was up-regulated, and increased expression of CD 50, the activation marker and ligand for CD 209 (DC-SIGN) was also observed. The interaction of <b>granulocytes</b> with DCs was visualized as the cluster where DCs, especially cDCs, were surrounded by <b>granulocytes</b> to form a ‘rosette’. After co-culture of <b>granulocytes</b> with cDCs, the secretion of elastase from <b>granulocytes</b> was enhanced significantly when examined cytohistochemically and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. An increase in myeloperoxidase (another activation index of <b>granulocytes)</b> was also observed after co-culture with DCs. These findings suggest the functional and phenotypical activation of <b>granulocytes</b> by interaction with DCs. Furthermore, we examined the involvement of adhesion molecules in the granulocyte–DC interaction, and found that CD 209 participates to some extent in this interaction...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMorphologically mature <b>granulocytes</b> from {{patients}} with chronic myeloid leukemia show significant impairment {{in their ability to}} internalize aggregated IgG, a ligand that is rapidly phagocytosed by normal human <b>granulocytes.</b> With a view to understand the molecular basis of this defect, normal and leukemic <b>granulocytes</b> were examined for the steady-state levels of mRNA for FcγRIII, a membrane-associated receptor that initially binds and traps the IgG-opsonized antigens. Northern blot analyses revealed that the level of the specific mRNA in CML <b>granulocytes</b> was between 0. 08 and 0. 69 times that seen in the normal <b>granulocytes.</b> This {{could be one of the}} contributory factors for the observed endocytic defect in the leukemic <b>granulocytes...</b>|$|R
25|$|The terms agranulocytosis, granulocytopenia and {{neutropenia}} {{are sometimes}} used interchangeably. Agranulocytosis implies a more severe deficiency than granulocytopenia. Neutropenia indicates a deficiency of neutrophils (the most common <b>granulocyte</b> cell) only.|$|E

40|$|During hemodialysis, {{alternative}} pathway complement activation leads to pulmonary sequestration of <b>granulocytes,</b> with loss of pulmonary vascular endothelial integrity and, at times, protein-rich pulmonary edema. An in vitro model {{of this phenomenon}} was constructed utilizing 51 Cr-labeled human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultures. In this system, <b>granulocytes,</b> when exposed to activated complement (C), induce endothelial damage; this injury is mediated primarily by oxygen radicals produced by the <b>granulocytes.</b> C 5 a {{appears to be the}} C component responsible for granulocyte-induced cytotoxicity; studies with cytochalasin B-treated <b>granulocytes</b> suggest that close approximation of the <b>granulocytes</b> and endothelial cells is necessary for maximal cell injury...|$|R
40|$|Cardiopulmonary {{bypass surgery}} induces an {{inflammatory}} reaction among others by activation of <b>granulocytes.</b> Leukocyte filtration {{has been shown}} to reduce the postoperative morbidity mediated by activated <b>granulocytes.</b> However, {{little is known about the}} mechanism of filter-leukocyte interaction, This study examines whether a leukocyte filter removes activated <b>granulocytes</b> or a general leukocyte population. Eleven patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery were included in this study, Leukocyte filtration was achieved before the reperfusion phase with a Pall non-woven polyester filter located at the venous side of the heart-lung machine. After filtration, the trapped <b>granulocytes</b> inside the filter were examined morphologically with light and scanning electron microscopy and immunologically by CD 45 RO antigen binding to the filter material. Furthermore, leukocyte release markers were measured to determine whether cells were activated during filtration. Microscopic evaluation revealed 84 % <b>granulocytes</b> and 14 % lymphocytes trapped in the filter, compared with 78 % <b>granulocytes</b> and 22 % lymphocytes in the blood before filtration. <b>Granulocytes</b> were trapped significantly more in the first blood contact layer of the filter material than in the middle layer and last layer, whereas lymphocytes trapped slightly more in the middle layer. The near maximum level of CD 45 RO expression was measured on <b>granulocytes</b> trapped inside the filter material, whereas CD 2 and CD 19 measured on lymphocytes were bound to a minor extent. beta-Glucuronidase concentration did not increase after filtration, suggesting the absence of activation of <b>granulocytes</b> by filtration, A leukocyte filter made of non-woven polyester material removes the activated <b>granulocytes</b> rather than leukocytes at random. This implies that this particular type of leukocyte removal filter is suitable for use in cardiopulmonary bypass patients whose <b>granulocytes</b> in the circulation are activated. Furthermore, measurement of activated <b>granulocytes</b> instead of total leukocyte count is likely preferable for functional assessment of leukocyte removal devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} this study show that {{recombinant}} interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) enhances the intracellular killing of Mycobacterium fortuitum by human <b>granulocytes.</b> This chemokine did not stimulate the phagocytosis of M. fortuitum by <b>granulocytes</b> at various bacterium-to-cell ratios. The killing process was not affected by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium bisulfate, which indicates that recombinant IL- 8 stimulates oxygen-independent mycobactericidal mechanisms of <b>granulocytes.</b> IL- 8 did not stimulate H 2 O 2 production in <b>granulocytes</b> but primed the cells for enhanced H 2 O 2 production upon stimulation with preopsonized M. fortuitum. In sum, the chemokine IL- 8 not only is involved in the recruitment of <b>granulocytes</b> to the site of infection but also facilitates the elimination of microorganisms by increasing the efficiency of the bactericidal activity of <b>granulocytes...</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{dominant}} {{point mutation}} {{has also been}} discovered that causes neutrophil <b>granulocyte</b> dysfunction and recurring infections.

25|$|The {{release of}} {{endotoxin}} is the {{mechanism by which}} Gram-negative sepsis provokes DIC. In acute promyelocytic leukemia, treatment causes the destruction of leukemic <b>granulocyte</b> precursors, resulting in the release of large amounts of proteolytic enzymes from their storage granules, causing microvascular damage. Other malignancies may enhance the expression of various oncogenes that result in the release of TF and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which prevents fibrinolysis.|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} {{inducing}} dendritic cells to present tumor antigens is by vaccination with autologous tumor lysates or short peptides (small parts of protein {{that correspond to}} the protein antigens on cancer cells). These peptides are often given in combination with adjuvants (highly immunogenic substances) to increase the immune and anti-tumor responses. Other adjuvants include proteins or other chemicals that attract and/or activate dendritic cells, such as <b>granulocyte</b> macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).|$|E

(2008) described that infiltration of <b>granulocytes</b> and neovascularization correlate {{with each other in}} chronic septic arthritis as well as in septic total arthroplasties. Neutrophil <b>granulocytes</b> produce cytokines in the process of neovascularization (Vågesjö et al. 2012).

25|$|The c-ANCA antigen is {{specifically}} proteinase 3 (PR3). p-ANCA antigens include myeloperoxidase (MPO) and bacterial permeability increasing factor (BPI). Other antigens exist for c-ANCA (atypical), however many are as yet unknown. Classical p-ANCA occurs with antibodies directed to MPO. p-ANCA without nuclear extension occurs with antibodies to BPI, cathepsin G, elastase, lactoferrin and lysozyme. GS-ANA are antibodies directed to <b>granulocyte</b> specific nuclear antigens. Atypical ANCA {{are thought to}} be antigens {{similar to that of the}} p-ANCAs, however may occur due to differences in neutrophil processing.|$|E
25|$|Immunofluorescence (IF) on ethanol-fixed {{neutrophils}} is used {{to detect}} ANCA, although formalin-fixed neutrophils {{may be used to}} help differentiate ANCA patterns. ANCA can be divided into four patterns when visualised by IF; cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA), C-ANCA (atypical), perinuclear ANCA (p-ANCA) and atypical ANCA (a-ANCA), also known as x-ANCA. c-ANCA shows cytoplasmic granular fluorescence with central interlobular accentuation. c-ANCA (atypical) shows cytoplasmic staining that is usually uniform and has no interlobular accentuation. p-ANCA has three subtypes, classical p-ANCA, p-ANCA without nuclear extension and <b>granulocyte</b> specific-antinuclear antibody (GS-ANA). Classical p-ANCA shows perinuclear staining with nuclear extension, p-ANCA without nuclear extension has perinuclear staining without nuclear extension and GS-ANA shows nuclear staining on granulocytes only. a-ANCA often shows combinations of both cytoplasmic and perinuclear staining.|$|E

40|$|Monomethylfumarate (MMF) is {{the most}} active {{metabolite}} of the new antipsoriasis drug Fumaderm. Because <b>granulocytes</b> {{play an important role}} in the pathophysiology of psoriasis, the effects of this drug on the functional activities of these cells were investigated. MMF stimulated polarization and elastase release, and enhanced the intracellular killing of bacteria by <b>granulocytes.</b> This compound suppressed the for- myl-Met-Nle-Phe (FMLP) –stimulated respiratory burst in these cells. MMF and dimethylfumarate but not its stereo- isomer dimethylmaleate, fumaric acid, or dimethylmalate stimulated polarization of and elastase release by <b>granulocytes,</b> indicating that methylated fumarate derivatives interact with <b>granulocytes</b> in a specific fashion. MMF did not affect the binding of formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys- fluorescein isothiocyanate to the FMLP receptor on <b>granulocytes.</b> This compound induced an increase in the intracellular Ca++ ([Ca++]i) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration. The agonistic effects of MMF on <b>granulocytes</b> are thought to be mediated by the rise in the [Ca++]i and the antagonistic effects by the increase in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration. These effects of MMF on <b>granulocytes</b> may in part explain the beneficial action of methylated fumarate derivatives on psoriatic skin lesions...|$|R
40|$|Measurement of the depolarized {{orthogonal}} {{light scattering}} in flow cytometry enables one to discriminate human eosinephilic <b>granulocytes</b> from neutrophilic <b>granulocytes.</b> We use this method {{to perform a}} four-parameter differential white blood cell analysis. A simple flow cytometer was built equipped with a 5 -mW helium neon laser that measures simultaneously four light scattering parameters. Lymphocytes, monocytes, and <b>granulocytes</b> were identified by simultaneously measuring the light scattering intensity at angles between 1. 0 ° and 2. 6 ° and angles between 3. 0 ° and 11. 0 °. Eosinophilic <b>granulocytes</b> were distinguished from neutrophilic <b>granulocytes</b> by simultaneous measurement of the orthogonal and depolarized orthogonal light scattering. Comparison of a white blood cell differentiation of 45 donors obtained by the Technicon H- 6000 and our instrument revealed good correlations.

40|$|The {{morphology}} and cytochemistry of Pinctada imbricata haemocytes {{were studied}} in vitro. Three distinct blood cell types were identified; hyalinocytes, <b>granulocytes,</b> and serous cells. Haemocytes were classified {{based on the}} presence/absence of granules, and nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. <b>Granulocytes</b> were the most common cell type (62 ± 2. 81 %), followed by hyalinocytes (36 ± 2. 35 %), and serous cells (2 ± 0. 90 %). <b>Granulocytes,</b> and hyalinocytes {{were found to be}} immunologically active, with the ability to phagocytose Congo red stained yeast. Of the cells involved in phagocytosis, <b>granulocytes</b> were the most active with 88. 8 ± 3. 9 % of these haemocytes engulfing yeast. Cytochemical stains (phenoloxidase, peroxidase, superoxide, melanin, neutral red) showed that enzymes associated with phagocytic activity were localised in granules within <b>granulocytes.</b> Based on their affinities for Giemsa/May–Grünwald stain, haemocytes were also defined as either acidic, basic or neutral. Hyalinocytes and serous cells were found to be eosinophilic, whilst <b>granulocytes</b> were either basophilic (large <b>granulocytes),</b> eosinophilic (small <b>granulocytes)</b> or {{a combination of the two}} (combination <b>granulocytes).</b> Light, differential interference contrast and epi-fluorescence microscopy identified three sub-populations of <b>granulocytes</b> based on size and granularity; small (4. 00 – 5. 00 μm in diameter, with small granules (0. 05 – 0. 5 μm in diameter), large (5. 00 – 9. 00 μm in diameter, with large granules (0. 50 – 2. 50 μm in diameter) and combination (5. 00 – 9. 00 μm in diameter, with both large and small granules).

However, the hemocyte types and their functions in the white-spotted flower chafers, Protaetia brevitarsis seulensis (Kolbe), are not known. In this study, we used various microscopes, molecular probes, and flow cytometric analyses to characterize the hemocytes in P. brevitarsis seulensis. The circulating hemocytes were classified based on their size, morphology, and dye-staining properties into six types, including <b>granulocytes,</b> plasmatocytes, oenocytoids, spherulocytes, prohemocytes, and adipohemocytes. The percentages of circulating hemocyte types were as follows: 13 % <b>granulocytes,</b> 20 % plasmatocytes, 1 % oenocytoids, 5 % spherulocytes, 17 % prohemocytes, and 44 % adipohemocytes. Next, we identified the professional phagocytes, <b>granulocytes,</b> which mediate encapsulation and phagocytosis of pathogens. The <b>granulocytes</b> were immunologically or morphologically activated and phagocytosed potentially hazardous substances in vivo. In addition, we showed that the phagocytosis by <b>granulocytes</b> is associated with autophagy, and that the activation of autophagy could be an efficient way to eliminate pathogens in this system.
