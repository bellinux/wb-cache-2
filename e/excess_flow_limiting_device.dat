40|$|Flow restricting {{devices were}} studied for their {{suitability}} as liquid water propellant flow limiters for the biowaste resistojet. <b>Flow</b> <b>limiting</b> during the start-up transient {{is required to}} prevent thrustor instabilities and icing which could result in heater failure in the electrical resistance heated thrustor (resistojet). The study was directed toward simple devices which would function passively (i. e., without power except from the propellant flow itself), and would offer high reliability and simplicity. In addition to the <b>flow</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>devices,</b> a thermal pumping system was studied to determine whether CO 2, desorbed from molecular sieves could be pumped thermally in a space station application. The thermal pump is considered a possible replacement for mechanical pumps. It involves a cyclic, constant volume cryopumping system which employs space radiators to achieve the cryotemperatures. The frozen CO 2 would be vaporized periodically, using a waste heat loop, to attain sufficient pressure to transfer {{a large portion of}} the trapped CO 2 to storage tanks...|$|R
40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{solutions to}} the potential problem of cryostat over pressurization by the nominal 65 psi MWAP LAr source dewar. Uncontrolled (by reason of failure) filling of a 15 psi MW AP cryostat by the LAr fill line could cause over pressurization by overwhelming the provided cryostat relief system. Three levels of protection against over pressurization by the source dewar are mentioned in this report; the reduced (operational) relief pressure, the source pressure regulator, and the LAr dewar cooling loop. Only {{the first of these}} is recognized by the ASME code as sufficient protection, the others provide operational convenience and avoid the loss of detector fluid. <b>Flow</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>device</b> solutions are not considered because of the conflicting requirement to empty and fill the cryostats rapidly (within one eight hour shift), e. g. the movement of the cryostat from the assembly hall to the collision hall, or the inverse operation...|$|R
40|$|Stock {{prices are}} {{observed}} to be random walks in time despite a strong, {{long term memory}} in the signs of trades (buys or sells). Lillo and Farmer have recently suggested that these correlations are compensated by opposite long ranged fluctuations in liquidity, with an otherwise permanent market impact, challenging the scenario proposed in Quantitative Finance 4, 176 (2004), where the impact is *transient*, with a power-law decay in time. The exponent of this decay is precisely tuned to a critical value, ensuring simultaneously that prices are diffusive on long time scales and that the response function is nearly constant. We provide new analysis of empirical data that confirm and make more precise our previous claims. We show that the power-law decay of the bare impact function comes both from an <b>excess</b> <b>flow</b> of <b>limit</b> order opposite to the market order flow, and to a systematic anti-correlation of the bid-ask motion between trades, two effects that create a `liquidity molasses' which dampens market volatility. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{computational}} framework is described for the {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulation of a bluff helicopter fuselage equipped with vortex generators (VGs). The VGs are explicitly discretized in the CFD mesh, using an overset grid method. A computational setup was developed allowing parametric investigations for VG size, pitch angle, position, number, arrangement, and thickness effects. High-density meshes were generated with successive grid overlap between body-fittedmeshes with high grid resolution in the boundary layer and Cartesian grids for the near and far field. The methodology {{was applied to the}} model-scale GOAHEAD model with sponsons. This model permits drag reduction by passive flow control on the model back ramp where the pronounced upsweep is responsible for a large separated flow at the backdoor/tail-boom junction. A test matrix was completed, and a VG layout proved its effectiveness for an eight-pair array of counterrotatingzero-thickness vane-type VGs, with the device height defined according to the local boundary layer thickness. At cruise conditions, some VG configurations tested achieve up to 5 % drag reduction by cumulated effects of <b>flow</b> reattachment, <b>limited</b> <b>device</b> drag, and static pressure recovery...|$|R

Tests using spores of higher fungi and other species of mildew demonstrated the specificity of the monoclonal. The antibody was used to develop lateral flow devices for sporangia of P. destructor. A competitive lateral flow format was developed which could detect onion downy mildew sporangia.

40|$|Ethiopia {{is known}} for its wealth of natural resources. These result in part from extreme {{elevation}} variation. However, 5, 000 years of land cultivation have degraded large areas of the natural environment. Soil erosion affects 82 % of the country. The rich highland soil, which supports 80 % of the total population, only covers 45 % of the country. In these highlands the soil is becoming less fertile; droughts are more frequent and intense; and water resources are declining, {{due in part to the}} soil erosion. The Anjeni watershed is located in the highlands in the Blue Nile Basin with an annual soil loss of 18. 33 tons/year/ha. The existence of soil erosion in a watershed is an indication of unsustainable land management practices. The objective of this study was to formulate sustainable land management options that alleviate soil erosion in the Anjeni watershed.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The use of {{vascular}} plug {{devices for}} the occlusion of high-flow lesions {{is a relatively}} new and successful procedure in peripheral and cardiopulmonary interventions. We report on the use and efficiency of the Amplatzer vascular plug in a small clinical series and discuss its potential for occlusion of large vessels and high-flow lesions in neurointerventions. METHODS: Between 2005 and 2007 four patients (mean age 38. 5 years, range 16 - 62 years) were treated with the device, in three patients to achieve parent artery occlusion of the internal carotid artery, in one patient to occlude a high-flow arteriovenous fistula of the neck. The application, time to occlusion, and angiographic and clinical results and the follow-up were evaluated. RESULTS: Navigation, positioning and detachment of the device were satisfactory in all cases. No flow-related migration of the plug was seen. The cessation of flow was delayed by a mean of 10. 5 min after deployment of the first device. In the procedures involving vessel sacrifice, two devices had to be deployed to achieve total occlusion. No patient experienced new neurological deficits; the 3 -month follow-up revealed stable results. CONCLUSION: The Amplatzer vascular plug can be adapted for the treatment of high-flow lesions and parent artery occlusions in the head and neck. In this small series the use of the devices was uncomplicated and safe. The rigid and large delivery device and the delayed cessation of <b>flow</b> currently <b>limit</b> the <b>device's</b> use in neurointerventions...|$|R
