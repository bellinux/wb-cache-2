25|$|Biopiracy {{describes}} a practice in which <b>indigenous</b> <b>knowledge</b> of nature, originating with indigenous peoples, {{is used by}} others for profit, without permission from and {{with little or no}} compensation or recognition to the indigenous people themselves. For example, when bioprospectors draw on <b>indigenous</b> <b>knowledge</b> of medicinal plants which is later patented by medical companies without recognizing the fact that the knowledge is not new, or invented by the patenter, and depriving the indigenous community to the rights to commercial exploitation of the technology that they themselves had developed. Critics of this practice, such as Greenpeace, claim these practices contribute to inequality between developing countries rich in biodiversity, and developed countries hosting companies that engage in 'biopiracy'.|$|E

40|$|The {{space and}} {{positioning}} of <b>Indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> (IK) within Australian curricula and pedagogy are often contentious, {{informed by the}} broader Australian sociocultural, political and economic landscape. Against changing educational policy, historically based on the myth of terra nullius, we discuss the shifting priorities for embedding <b>Indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> in educational practice in university and school curricula and pedagogy. In this chapter, we argue that personal and professional commitment to social justice is an important starting point for embedding <b>Indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> in the Australian school curricula and pedagogy. Developing teacher knowledge around embedding IK is required to enable teachers’ preparedness to navigate a contested historical/colonising space in curriculum decisionmaking, teaching and learning. We draw on empirical data from a recent research project on supporting pre-service teachers as future curriculum leaders; the project {{was funded by the}} Office of Learning and Teaching (OLT). This project aimed to support future curriculum leaders to develop their knowledge of embedding IK at one Australian university. We propose supporting the embedding of IK in situ with pre-service teachers and their supervising teachers on practicum in real, sustained and affirming ways that shifts the recognition of IK from personal commitment to social justice in education, to one that values <b>Indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> as content to educate (Connell, 1993). We argue that sustained engagement with and appreciation of IK has the potential to decolonise Australian curricula, shift policy directions and enhance race relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we propose {{that there are}} certain {{conditions}} that enable the agency of pre-service teachers to enact curriculum decision-making within their pedagogical relationships with their supervising teachers as they endeavour to embed <b>Indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> (IK) during the teaching practicum. The case study, underpinned by decolonising methodologies, centred upon pre-service teacher preparation at one Australian university, where we investigated how role modelling in urban and remote schools occurred in the learning and teaching relationships between pre-service teachers on practicum and their supervising teachers. This chapter draws from an Office of Learning and Teaching (OLT) sponsored project at one Australian university; a full report on this project has been documented (see McLaughlin, Whatman and Nielsen, 2014).

40|$|Never in {{the history}} of {{knowledge}} production in the age of Western-centred modernity has the idea of <b>indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> been as important to the imagination of the future of the world as in the 21 st century. This is mainly because the 21 st century is a period in which the current hegemonic Western ways of knowing, imagining and seeing the world have proved to be inefficient in providing solutions to many of the global challenges that they have caused. This failure by the Western knowledge production system to provide lasting solutions to the most pressing challenges of the 21 st century that it has caused, such as the global financial crisis, conflict and climate change, has led to the emergence of the question of whether a different model of the world outside the Western-centred one can be imagined. This article is a decolonial critique of the popular but controversial subject of <b>indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> in the 21 st century. The article argues that the idea of <b>indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> can serve as a basis on which another world outside the present Western-centric one can be imagined...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1970 s {{there has}} been {{increased}} focus by institutions, government, and Indigenous nations on improving Aboriginal peoples participation and success in Canadian higher education; however disparity continues to be evident in national statistics of educational attainment, social determinants of health, and socio-economic status of Aboriginal compared to non-Aboriginal Canadians. For instance, post-secondary attainment for Aboriginal peoples is still only 8 % compared to 20 % {{of the rest of}} Canada (Statistics Canada, 2008, 2013). A challenge within higher education has been creating the space within predominately Euro-Western defined and ascribed structures, academic disciplines, policies, and practices to create meaningful spaces for Indigenous peoples.

40|$|This {{special issue}} of AlterNative explores the theme of <b>Indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> {{impacting}} the environment. While {{the focus is on}} Australia, one paper discusses the Canadian context, and the issue as a whole has international relevance. The six articles form part of the research outcomes of an Australian Research Council (ARC) project entitled Indigenous Knowledge:Water Sustainability and Wild Fire Mitigation, awarded to senior Kaurna elder "Yerloburka" Uncle Lewis O&# 039;Brien. The articles complement each other in exploring how the narrative of terra nullius has sought to obfuscate the "rich and layered understanding of our relationship to country" of Indigenous peoples (Watson, this issue, p. 509). The papers in this issue reflect on the colonial narrative for Indigenous peoples in Australia and across the globe. Undeniably, <b>Indigenous</b> environmental <b>knowledge</b> that may have once been dismissed as "primitive" or "unsophisticated" is now increasingly sought by dominant postcolonial societies in efforts to protect scarce and valuable natural resources. The arguments and supporting evidence investigated in this issue contribute to the positioning of <b>Indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> at the forefront of debates around urgent environmental issues including climate change, sustainability, and the tension between development and the environment. Each contributor confronts the imposition of Western ideas on Indigenous communities from within <b>Indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> research frameworks or in collaboration with Indigenous elders.

40|$|The {{imperative}} for Indigenous education in Australia {{is influenced by}} national political, social and economic discourses as Australian education systems continue to grapple with an agreed aspiration of full participation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. Innovations within and policies guiding our education systems are often driven by agendas of reconciliation, equity, equality in participation and social justice. In this paper, we discuss key themes that emerged from a recent Australian Office for Learning and Teaching (OLT) research project which investigated ways in which preservice teachers from one Australian university embedded <b>Indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> (IK) on teaching practicum. Using a phenomenological approach, the case involved 25 preservice teacher and 23 practicum supervisor participants, over a 30 month investigation. Attention was directed {{to the nature of}} subjective (lived) experiences of participants in these pedagogical negotiations and thus preservice and supervising teacher voice was actively sought in naming and analysing these experiences. Findings revealed that change, knowledge, help and affirmation were key themes for shaping discourses around <b>Indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> and perspectives in the Australian curriculum and defined the nature of the pedagogical relationships between novice and experienced teachers. We focus particularly on the need for change and affirmation by preservice teachers and their teaching practicum supervisors as they developed their pedagogical relationships whilst embedding <b>Indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> in learning and teaching.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{recognition}} of <b>indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> in primary education in the Wayanad district in South India. India has made substantial progress in terms of providing free, compulsory education for all children, and in official rhetoric education {{is no longer a}} privilege for the wealthy minority, but should be accessible to everyone. Yet, inequality prevails. Even in the South Indian state of Kerala which is well-known for it's achievements in social development. As the nation has experiences rapid economic growth, the tribal population – adivasis – of India is still a politically, economic and socially marginalized minority. In Kerala they constitute the most marginalized part of the population, with low levels of educational attainment, employment and health. In 2007 the Kerala Curriculum Framwork 2007 was launched. The curriculum is based on critical pedagogy, rejecting the historically elitist education system inherited from colonial times, and explicitly encourages educational reforms in terms of addressing low educational attainment among girls, children from marginalized communities, and children with special needs. Based on an analysis of the objectives in the KCF 2007, compared with the statements of teachers and professionals in Wayanad, this thesis explores {{the recognition of}} knowledges, culture and languages of indigenous peoples in public primary education in Kerala. Moreover, it includes a discussion of the connections between education and identity construction in marginalized communities. Within the conceptual framework of modernity and tradition this thesis explores tensions between Western scientific <b>knowledges</b> and <b>indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> in India, and more specifically, how these tensions are played out within the educational sphere of public primary education in the Wayanad district. The discussion of the recognition of <b>indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> in education is further connected to the possibility of <b>indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> to represent an alternative to an unsustainable, exploitative approach to the world's natural resources. As India continue to grow as an economic superpower the possibility of a sustainable development seems to be quite pertinent. This is further connected to the broader subject of education as an arena for social change. Master i flerkulturell og internasjonal utdannin...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the construction of}} the concepts “science,” “scientific literacy,” and “Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing” in Science 10, Saskatchewan’s tenth-grade school science curriculum guide.

The construction of “science” and “scientific literacy” revealed assumptions characteristic of modern Western science, while “Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing” were paradoxically constructed as commensurable with but other than “science. ” These findings demonstrate that <b>Indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> and ways of knowing are misunderstood in the curriculum guide. Moreover, the research suggests that thematic content may provide a better point of entry for the integration of <b>Indigenous</b> <b>knowledges</b> and ways of knowing into mainstream science programs than specific knowledge content (which may not necessarily cross cultural borders).
