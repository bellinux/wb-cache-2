40|$|Neuregulins (NDF, heregulin, GGF ARIA, or SMDF) are EGF-like {{growth and}} {{differentiation}} factors that signal through tyrosine kinase receptors of the ErbB family. Here, we report a novel phenotype in mice with targeted mutations in the erbB 2, erbB 3, or neuregulin- 1 genes. These three mutations cause a severe hypoplasia {{of the primary}} sympathetic <b>ganglion</b> <b>chain.</b> We provide evidence that migration of neural crest cells to the mesenchyme lateral of the dorsal aorta, in which they differentiate into sympathetic neurons, depends on neuregulin- 1 and its receptors. Neuregulin- 1 is expressed at the origin of neural crest cells. Moreover, a tight link between neuregulin- 1 expression, the migratory path, and the target site of sympathogenic neural crest cells is observed. Sympathetic ganglia synthesize catecholamines in the embryo and the adult. Accordingly, catecholamine levels in mutant embryos are severely decreased, and we suggest {{that the lack of}} catecholamines contributes to the embryonal lethality of the erbB 3 mutant mice. Thus, neuregulin- 1, erbB 2, and erbB 3 are required for the formation of the sympathetic nervous system; the block in development observed in mutant mice is caused by a lack of neural crest precursor cells in the anlage of the primary sympathetic <b>ganglion</b> <b>chain.</b> Together with previous observations, these findings establish the neuregulin signaling system as a key regulator in the development of neural crest cells...|$|E
40|$|The various neuropiles and {{cellular}} glomeruli of the brain, suboesophageal ganglion and ventral <b>ganglion</b> <b>chain</b> {{were identified in}} Gammarus setosus Dementieva. Two types of neurosecretory cells, A and B, {{were present in the}} brain glomeruli, two in the glomeruli of the suboesophageal ganglion, A and A', and four in the glomeruli of the ventral ganglia, A, A', B and C, all based on perikaryon size. There were two types of neurosecretory granules in the cells of the brain glomeruli, type I were small, dense spheres 98 - 160 nm in diameter found only in the A cells, while the larger type II vesicles ranged from 195 - 815 nm, resembled mitochondria and were found in both A and B cells. The type I granules were Golgi-formed but the origin of the type II vesicles is uncertain, the possibilities being transformation of Golgi-formed multivesicular bodies (MVB), or mitochondrial fission and alteration of conformation. Accessory cephalic structures present in the anterior head region were the sinus gland, paired statocysts and a dorsal, medial, unpaired frontal organ. Production and release of neurosecretory material (NSM), was observed in the frontal organ neurons and they were divided into two types, I and II, based on the size of their secretory granules. Those of type I ranged from 1000 - 4500 nm in diameter, similar in morphology to the type II vesicles of the brain but larger, while the type II vesicles of the frontal organ neurons were 300 - 900 nm and Golgi-formed. The frontal organ appears to be a neurohemal organ with the NSM liberated through rupture of the cell membrane. The sinus gland contained variable amounts of NSM but release was not observed and no X organ was found. Morphological alteration of the follicular epithelium was noted before vitellogenesis begins and the hepatopancreas was indicated as a probable source of the vitellogenic materials. Decrease in photoperiod stimulates vitellogenesis in late summer and long photoperiods (14 hours light) prolong the ovarian cycle, while shorter ones (12 and 8 hours light) accelerate it respectively. Complete darkness resulted in successive cycles after resorption of the oocytes. The type I frontal organ neurons appear to release an ovary-inhibiting hormone while the role of the type II neurons is unknown. The secretions of the neurosecretory cells of the brain and ganglia also have an uncertain effect upon reproduction with evidence to support either a stimulatory or inhibitory effect dependent upon the type of release exhibited...|$|E
40|$|Results of optomotor {{experiments}} on Musca and Drosophila {{led to the}} formulation of a conceptual model which allows the prediction of the insect's response to defined moving stimuli. A basic requirement of the model is that there should exist in the <b>ganglion</b> <b>chain,</b> between the compound eye and the motor output, cross-connections between the channels of information flow in the ganglia. Further optomotor experiments provided evidence about the directions within the ganglion of the cross-connections. The first visual ganglion of Musca is built of sub-units called cartridges, {{each of which is}} composed of six retinular cell axons synapsing onto five different neurons; some of which are second order neurons, some of higher order. One of these five neurons, “L 4 " has two long collaterals {{at the base of the}} lamina, which run from the cartridge to the two neighbouring cartridges in the hexagonal array. This configuration is compatible with that suggested by the optomotor experiments for the cross-connections postulated by the conceptual model. Thus it was of interest to examine the synaptic connections made by the terminations or "endfeet" of these collaterals. This study reports the results of examination, by electron microscopy, of serial ultra-thin sections of the first visual ganglion containing L 4 collaterals. The results show that the three collaterals which terminate in each cartridge (two long collaterals from neighbouring cartridges plus one short one from the L 4 within the cartridge) do so in intimate contact with each other and with the two second-order neurons LI and L 2. The three collaterals are presynaptic to each other, each to the other two. Each of them is also presynaptic to the L 2 neuron in that cartridge, and it seems that each synaptic contact between two members of the three collaterals is also simultaneously a contact with L 2. No contacts are made to the LI fibre, in contrast to the systematic pattern of contacts to the L 2 fibre. In addition to this basic scheme of connections the collaterals are also presynaptic to some of the retinular cell axons, usually R 3 and R 5, apparently in cartridges from the more central parts of the ganglion, or there may be a gradient of connectivity across the ganglion. Since no studies, apart from the anatomical ones, exist on this network, the conclusions drawn about the significance of these results must be tentative. The results are not incompatible with the idea that these collaterals could be the cross-connections postulated in the conceptual model. One function possibly mediated by the network could be lateral inhibition, which has been shown to occur in Musca...|$|E
40|$|In the leech, {{regeneration}} after injury {{depends on}} extrinsic factors (see von Bernhardi and Muller, 1995) that can enhance or inhibit axon growth. Such factors include extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, cell adhesion molecules and growth {{factors in the}} environment. Extrinsic factors can be provided by non-neuronal cells, such as microglial cells (Morgese et al., 1983; McGlade-McCulloh et al., 1989). Leech microglia, which are macrophage-like cells resident in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), resemble vertebrate microglia in their morphology (Coggeshall and Fawcett, 1964; Elliott and Muller, 1981). They are elongated and are evenly distributed along the connectives and in the ganglia. In culture, microglial cells show different properties depending {{on the nature of the}} surface on which they are plated (Masuda-Nakagawa et al., 1994). On a substratum rich in laminin, microglia are spindle-shaped, motile and are contacted by growing neurites (Masuda-Nakagawa et al., 1994). On Concanavalin A (Con-A), microglia are rounded, immobile and are avoided by neurites, which collapse after contacting the microglia (Chiquet and Nicholls, 1987). After injury to the leech CNS, microglial cells rapidly accumulate at the lesion site, where they play a role in repair. Microglial cells have been show to phagocytose debris (Ling, 1981; Perry and Gordon, 1988), to synthesise laminin and to deposit extracellular matrix components (Masuda-Nakagawa et al., 1994). This accumulation of microglia in the leech resembles the invasion of haemocytes observed at sites of injury in the cockroach CNS (Treherne et al., 1984; Smith et al., 1987). Isolated mammalian microglia undergo transformations in response to cytokines and other factors (Suzumura et al., 1991) and are themselves are able to secrete soluble growth factors (Frei et al., 1987; Banati et al., 1993; Elkabes et al., 1996). In the present experiments, microglial cells were plated on Con-A and were exposed to injured <b>ganglion</b> <b>chains</b> or to medium conditioned by injured CNS. The morphological responses of the microglial cells wer...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few years a large body of {{experimental}} data has been amassed on the physiology of the arthropod nervous system (see the review by Roeder (8)) but, unfortunately, the full significance of these data is difficult to assess for lack of information on the fine structure of the arthropod neuropile. Some papers have been published that treat the electron microscopic morphology of the arthropod nervous system (7, 4, 3, 1, 2, 9, 5). The present work is a brief report of observations on the fine structure of a distinctive type of nerve fiber found in the abdominal ganglia of Armadillidium vulgare (Crustacea-Isopoda). The <b>ganglion</b> <b>chains</b> of adult specimens were fixed for 30 minutes in a 1 per cent OsO 4 solution (veronal buffer pH 7. 9) and were embedded, following the usual procedure, in n-butyl methaerylate. Observed under the electron microscope, ArmadiUidium ganglia have the well known appearance of arthropod ganglia in general, that is: neurons and glial cells are arranged at the periphery of the ganglion while the central region is a dense assembly of interwoven fibers called the neuropile. An attentive study of the neuropile reveals that it is formed of a great number of nerve fibers together with thin glial processes. The majority of the nerve fibers have the structural pattern already described in other arthropods. In a few fibers, however, the structural components appear in an unusual arrangement thus constituting a special type of nerve fiber. Two main features characterize this special type of nerve fiber: (a) the existence of regularly spaced and transversely oriented cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and (b) the existence of a great number of mitochondria in close contact with the limiting membrane. The transverse cisternae lend to this type of fiber a typical cross-striated appearance. These cisternae are not parts of a continuous septa, but rather, fenestrated structures that allow the flow of material within the neuroplasm. Their spatial arrangement can be inferred from images such as those shown in Figs. 1 and 2 in which the transverse cisternae are seen as discontinuou...|$|R
40|$|We {{identified}} a novel gene, Ks- 1, which is expressed preferentially in the small-type Kenyon {{cells of the}} honeybee brain. This gene is also expressed {{in some of the}} large soma neurons in the brain and in the suboesophageal <b>ganglion.</b> Reverse transcription-polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction experiments indicated that Ks- 1 transcripts are enriched in the honeybee brain. cDNA cloning revealed that the consensus Ks- 1 cDNA is over 17 kbp and contains no significant open reading frames. Furthermore, fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed that Ks- 1 transcripts are located in the nuclei of the neural cells, accumulating in some scattered spots. These findings demonstrate that Ks- 1 encodes a novel class of noncoding nuclear RNA and is possibly involved in the regulation of neural functions...|$|R
40|$|In Gnathostomata, the {{sympathetic}} nervous system is {{a branch of the}} autonomic nervous system and it is responsible for the unconscious control of the inner organs. It mainly conveys stress responses, the so called “flight or fight” reaction. Sympathetic neurons are derivatives of the neural crest, a pluripotent embryological cell lineage that has migratory capabilities. Neural crest cells give rise to various tissues, for example sensory neurons, autonomic neurons, glia, melanocytes, cells of the adrenal medulla as well as the bone, cartilage, connective tissue and muscle cells of the head. Lampreys are jawless basal vertebrates, Agnatha, that resemble Cambrian era fossils. Lampreys do have neural crest cells and most of their derivatives, but lack a commissural sympathetic chain. Despite the absence of a definite sympathetic <b>ganglion</b> <b>chain,</b> different cell types of endocrine cells were reported to implement sympathetic functions in lampreys. To shed light on the evolution and development of {{the sympathetic}} nervous system, immunohistochemistry, DiI cell tracing and in-situ hybridization experiments were carried out. Staining with a pan-neuronal antibody as well as the DiI cell labeling in lampreys confirmed the presence of dorsal root and enteric ganglia. In-situ hybridizations with probes against the {{sympathetic nervous system}} marker genes Ascl 1, dHand and Phox 2 b, visualized transcripts of these genes in various tissues that correspond to the known expression of these genes in gnathostomes, except for expression in sites where sympathetic ganglia would be expected. None of the three different techniques detected sympathetic ganglia cells or cells that could be regarded as sympathetic precursor cells. The absence of a commissural sympathetic chain in lampreys led to the hypothesis that redeployment of genes within the gene regulatory network for sympathetic neuron differentiation contributed to the appearance of the sympathetic nervous system. To test this hypothesis the cis-regulatory activity of three conserved non-coding elements was compared in lamprey and chicken using a reporter expression assay. A conserved non-coding element lying directly proximal to the chicken Phox 2 b promoter showed expression in the chicken. In contrast, this element was silent when the same three sequences were tested in lamprey. The only element which gave rise to expression in lamprey was a different one, which is spanning the first intron. Surprisingly the two different conserved non-coding elements drove expression in corresponding tissues in both species. None of the tested elements showed expression in sympathetic neurons or ganglia. The interspecies experiment showed that chicken genomic regions can successfully recruit transcription factors and drive expression in the lamprey. This study confirms that a commissural sympathetic chain and peripheral sympathetic neurons are absent in lampreys. It is a plausible scenario that changes in cis-regulatory linkages led to the evolutionary deployment of neural crest cells as precursors for sympathetic neurons. Hence, the evolution of the sympathetic nervous system is discussed based on the presented results and in the light of previous publications. ...|$|E
40|$|Paraganglioma {{normally}} {{occurs in}} sites that parallel the sympathetic and parasympathetic <b>chain</b> <b>ganglions.</b> Common locations of paraganglioma include tumours of paraganglionic system in {{head and neck}} region like carotid body paraganglioma and jugulotypmanic paraganglioma. There are also paragangliomas that occur outside the usual distribution of sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglia. Pathological diagnosis of paraganglioma depends on the characteristic histological features and immnohistochemical detection of neuroendocrine marker(s). Composite paragangliomas (paragangliomas with features of ganglioneuroma or ganglioneuroblastoma) are sometimes noted. The malignant potential of paraganglioma is difficult to be assessed. Assessment systems have been proposed in the pathology reporting of paraganglioma in order to predict the malignant behaviour of the tumour. In this context, proliferative activity obtained from Ki- 67 immunohistochemical staining should be provided in the reporting of paraganglioma. Recent developments in molecular genetics have expanded the spectrum of disorders associated with paragangliomas. The relevant clinical impact in pathology {{is the role of}} pathologist in the detection of SDHB by immunohistochemistry in paraganglioma as SDHB mutations are strongly correlated with head and neck paraganglioma, presence of metastasis and poor prognosis. A high index of suspicion should be applied as paraganglioma occur in diverse sites. Also, awareness of the need of updated pathological and immunological data are essential for proper management of patients with paraganglioma. Griffith Health FacultyNo Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Autonomic {{innervation}} of {{the prostate}} gland supplies the acini, and non-vascular and vascular smooth muscle. The activity {{of each of these}} tissues is enhanced by sympathetic outflow, whereas the role of the parasympathetic nervous system in this organ is unclear. In the present study, a range of methods was applied in rats to determine the location of autonomic neurons supplying this gland, the immunohistochemical properties of these neurons, the spinal connections made with the postganglionic pathways and the distribution of various axon types within the gland. Injection of the retrograde tracer, FluoroGold, into the ventral gland visualised neurons within the major pelvic <b>ganglion</b> and sympathetic <b>chain.</b> Fluorescence immunohistochemical studies on the labelled pelvic neurons showed that most were noradrenergic (also containing neuropeptide Y, NPY), the others being non-noradrenergic and containing either vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or NPY. Sympathetic dyelabelled neurons were identified by the presence of varicose nerve terminals stained for synaptophysin on their somata following lesion of sacral inputs. Parasympathetic innervation of dye-labelled neurons was identified by continued innervation after hypogastric nerve lesion. Most noradrenergic prostate-projecting neurons were sympathetic, as were many of the non-noradrenergic VIP neurons. Parasympathetic prostate-projecting neurons were largely non-noradrenergic and contained either VIP or NPY. All substances found in retrogradely labelled somata were located in axons within the prostate gland but had slightly different patterns of distribution. The studies have shown that there are a significant number of non-noradrenergic sympathetic prostate-projecting neurons, which contain VIP...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was the {{assessment}} of the efficacy of thoracoscopic cervicodorsal and open lumbar sympathectomy for the reduction of pain severity and disability associated with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD). Methods: From 1992 to 2000, 73 patients with RSD underwent 46 video-assisted thoracoscopic (first to fourth thoracic ganglion) or 37 surgical lumbar (first to fourth lumbar <b>ganglion)</b> sympathetic <b>chain</b> resections. The patients were referred from multidisciplinary pain clinics with documented sympathetically maintained pain syndrome on the basis of reproducible more than 50 % reduction in pain severity score (0, no pain; 10, most severe pain imaginable) for more than 2 days after sympathetic block therapy. The mean duration of the RSD symptoms before sympathectomy was 26 ± 14 months (range, 6 to 100 months). Postoperative pain severity score, limb disability, and overall patient satisfaction were assessed by an independent third-party observer at a mean follow-up period of 30 months. Results: No operative mortality or serious morbidity (Horner's syndrome, bleeding that needed transfusion, wound infection) occurred. Transient (< 3 -month) postprocedural sympathalgia developed in one third of the patients for cervicodorsal sympathectomy and 20 % of the patients for lumbar sympathectomy and was treated effectively with trigger point/proximal ganglion block therapy or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. At 3 months after sympathectomy, 10 % of the patients had conditions that were judged treatment failures with no reduction in pain severity or limb disability. The remaining patients testified to more than 50 % pain reduction, with pain severity scores decreasing from a mean of 8. 7 before surgery to 3. 4 after sympathectomy. At 1 year, one quarter of the patients had continued significant pain relief (pain severity score, < 3) and an additional 50 % of the patients indicated continued but reduced pain severity and an increase in daily/work activities. Overall, patient satisfaction (willingness to have procedure again, benefit from sympathectomy) was 77 % and was not significantly influenced by patient age, RSD duration/stage, or extremity involvement (lumbar, 84 %; cervicodorsal, 72 %). Conclusion: Patients with RSD with a confirmed sympathetically maintained pain syndrome can realize long-term benefit from surgical sympathectomy. Procedural efficacy was similar for both upper limb and lower limb RSD syndromes, although the level of pain reduction did deteriorate with time. After sympathectomy, the patients with RSD had a low incidence rate (7 %) of “new” complex regional pain or disabling compensatory sweating syndromes. (J Vasc Surg 2002; 35 : 269 - 77. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} {{the architecture of the}} nervous system, neurons must connect with their targets. A search for cues that help guide growth cones resulted in the purification and cloning of a chemorepellent, semaphorin 3 A. This gene is now known {{to be a member of}} a gene family with at least twenty members in every vertebrate species. This thesis describes the identification characterization of another semaphorin, semaphorin 3 C. Semaphorin 3 A and 3 C have distinct biological activities; semaphorin 3 A collapses the growth cones of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and sympathetic <b>chain</b> <b>ganglion</b> (SCG) neurons while semaphorin 3 C only collapses SCG neurons. Semaphorin 3 A and its relatives semaphorin 3 C, 3 D and 3 E bind to overlapping but distinct axon tracts. We infer that there are distinct receptors with different affinities for 3 A, C, D and E. These four semaphorins, all bind recombinant neuropilin with similar affinities. We propose that neuropilin is a common component of a semaphorin receptor complex, and that additional differentially expressed receptor components interact with the semaphorin domains to confer binding specificity. Although semaphorin 3 A and semaphorin 3 C can function as chemorepellents in vitro, little is known about their functions in vivo. Misexpression of semaphorin 3 A disrupts many sensory axon pathways including the dorsal funiculus, the olfactory nerve, the trigerminal nerve, the glosspharyngeal nerve and the vagus nerve. Overexpression of semaphorin 3 A in the dorsal midbrain also leads to pathfinding defects of the trochlear nerve. Misexpression of semaphorin 3 C does not result in any obvious pathfinding errors. These studies confirm a repellent role for semaphorin 3 A in vivo but do not support any such role for semaphorin 3 C. To further investigate the function of semaphorin 3 C in vivo, we have disrupted the semaphorin 3 C locus in mice. Semaphorin 3 C knock out mice die postnatally from congenital cardiac defects. Our results raise the possibility that semaphorin 3 C may function as an important specification, guidance, or differentiation cue for the cardiac neural crest. We have mapped the genomic location of semaphorin 3 A, 3 B, 3 C, and 3 E to mouse chromosome 5 corresponding to human chromosome 7 q. Defects in human semaphorin 3 C might underlie some forms of congenital cardiac disease. ...|$|R
