500|$|The main {{usage of}} zinc oxide (zinc white) was in paints {{and as an}} {{additive}} to ointments. Zinc white was accepted as a pigment in oil paintings by 1834 {{but it did not}} mix well with oil. This problem was solved by optimizing the synthesis of ZnO. In 1845, LeClaire in Paris was producing the oil paint on a large scale, and by 1850, zinc white was being manufactured throughout Europe. The success of zinc white paint was due to its advantages over the traditional white lead: zinc white is essentially permanent in sunlight, it is not blackened by sulfur-bearing air, it is non-toxic and more economical. Because zinc white is so [...] "clean" [...] it is valuable for making tints with other colors, but it makes a rather brittle <b>dry</b> <b>film</b> when unmixed with other colors. For example, during the late 1890s and early 1900s, some artists used zinc white as a ground for their oil paintings. All those paintings developed cracks over the years.|$|E

50|$|In general, {{the lower}} the surface tension of a liquid coating, the easier {{it will be to}} form a {{satisfactory}} wet film from it. The difference between the surface tension of a coating and the surface energy of a solid substrate to which a coating is applied affects how the liquid coating flows out over the substrate. It also affects the strength of the adhesive bond between the substrate and the <b>dry</b> <b>film.</b> If for instance, the surface tension of the coating is higher than the surface tension of the substrate, then the coating will not spread out and form a film. As the surface tension of the substrate is increased, it will reach a point to where the coating will successfully wet the substrate but have poor adhesion. Continuous increase in the coating surface tension will result in better wetting in film formation and better <b>dry</b> <b>film</b> adhesion.|$|E

40|$|Fracture {{mechanics}} successfully predicts when cracks will grow. Describing {{the path}} that cracks follow, however, has remained difficult. The study of crack paths has recently focused on a single experimental system, that of thermally quenched glass, where straight, wavy, helical, and branched cracks appear under different conditions. Several models of crack path prediction have been developed but none is generally accepted. Here we show that slowly oscillating wavy cracks can form during the drying of a colloidal dispersion. These <b>drying</b> <b>films</b> are subject to large stress gradients perpendicular to the mean direction of crack growth. Under these conditions existing models do not predict periodic paths. We show, instead, how to model crack paths by allowing a growing crack to curve towards the direction of maximum energy release rate. Not only does this explain wavy cracks in <b>drying</b> <b>films,</b> and correctly describe the wavelength dependence of our experiments, but it is generally applicable to predicting crack paths in spatially varying stress fields...|$|R
