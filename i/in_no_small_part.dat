The Ladies' Home Journal and Reader's Digest both published condensed versions and it was selected in June 1956 by the Book of the Month Club. The first paperback edition was published by Bantam Books in October 1956.|$|E

It was no new intelligence to any of the family, that Harvey Birch was distrusted and greatly harassed by the American army.

But the avenues of their solution were different. Russia and the other states that took the place of the USSR are now confronted with a major new task: the task of restricting military-economic activity, the conversion of the military economy, and its adaptation to new conditions.

60|$|I {{think that}} I became popular {{among those with}} whom I associated. I have long been aware of a certain {{weakness}} in my own character, which I may call a craving for love. I have ever had a wish to be liked by those around me,--a wish that {{during the first half}} of my life was never gratified. <b>In</b> my school-days <b>no</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> of my misery came from the envy with which I regarded the popularity of popular boys. They seemed to me to live in a social paradise, while the desolation of my pandemonium was complete. And afterwards, when I was in London as a young man, I had but few friends. Among the clerks in the Post Office I held my own fairly for the first two or three years; but even then I regarded myself as something of a pariah. My Irish life had been much better. I had had my wife and children, and had been sustained by a feeling of general respect. But even in Ireland I had in truth lived but little in society. Our means had been sufficient for our wants, but insufficient for entertaining others. It was not till we had settled ourselves at Waltham that I really began to live much with others. The Garrick Club was the first assemblage of men at which I felt myself to be popular.|$|R
5000|$|Avelum is {{very much}} a novel of Georgia—a Soviet Socialist Republic for most of Avelum's (and Chiladze's) life, but the book written and first {{appearing}} in a newly independent nation. There's a sense of fatalism -- [...] "Probably nothing more was going to change for a long time here in Georgia, assuming that anything ever changed"—while throughout Avelum struggles with his role in the process of political change. Two dates mark his life, both instantly recognizable to Georgian readers (both also sometimes call the 'Tbilisi massacre'): 9 March 1956, when Soviet troops fired on protesting students, and 9 April 1989, when Soviet troop again fired on protesters. These are historically fraught dates: 9 March was the third anniversary of the death of (Georgian-born) Stalin, and the protests in part a reaction to Khrushchev's 20th Congress denunciation of Stalin. As to the 9 April events: while it would be two more years before independence was declared, the 1989 clash was the turning point in anti-Soviet protests—and is still celebrated as a public holiday in Georgia, the Day of National Unity. On both days, Avelum feels he falls short. In 1956 he sees an injured boy but is unable to really help him. In 1989 his daughter, called Little Katie, takes part in the protests, and winds up deeply scarred by events, compounding uninvolved Avelum's feelings of guilt. These two separate events and their fallout, so important in both the history of Georgia and in Avelum's own life, hover over the entire book, even as Chiladze shifts his focus elsewhere. Much of the novel, in fact, deals with entirely different matters—in particular, Avelum's efforts at flight, both geographically and into love-affairs (his attempts to flee connected, as he travels to Moscow and abroad because of the women in his life). Avelum is married to Melania, the mother of Little Katie, and despite his straying he remains devoted to her and their family-unit <b>in</b> Tbilisi—in <b>no</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> because of their shared history, which is also their shared national history: ...|$|R
5|$|A {{decision}} to purchase another twelve C-130s {{was announced in}} November 1964. At this time the C-130As were being used to supply the Australian forces engaged in the Vietnam War. This task demonstrated that the RAAF had insufficient long-ranged transport aircraft to simultaneously support overseas deployments and meet the force's domestic requirements in Australia. As a result, the Government decided to order twelve C-130E Hercules {{as part of a}} package of acquisitions for the RAAF and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) that also included ten Lockheed P-3 Orion and fourteen Grumman S-2 Tracker maritime patrol aircraft, as well as twelve Hawker Siddeley HS 748 transports. The 14.7-million-pound contract for the new C-130s was signed on 9 February 1965. In contrast to the concerns raised by the government over the cost of purchasing the C-130As, this expansion of the Hercules force gained ready agreement, due <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> to the benefits for the armed services, particularly the Australian Army, demonstrated by the first twelve aircraft. The long-serving C-130As were replaced by new Hercules in the late 1970s; twelve C-130Hs were ordered in June 1976 for a cost of $A86 million, and deliveries took place between July and October 1978.|$|E

5|$|The procellariids {{lack the}} {{elaborate}} breeding dances of the albatrosses, <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> {{due to the}} tendency of most of them to attend colonies at night and breed in burrows, where visual displays are useless. The fulmarine petrels, which nest {{on the surface and}} attend their colonies diurnally, do use a repertoire of stereotyped behaviours such as cackling, preening, head waving and nibbling, but for most species courtship interactions are limited to some billing (rubbing the two bills together) in the burrow and the vocalisations made by all species. The calls serve a number of functions: they are used territorially to protect burrows or territories and to call for mates. Each call type is unique to a particular species and indeed it is possible for procellariids to identify the sex of the bird calling as well. It may also be possible to assess the quality of potential mates; a study of blue petrels found a link between the rhythm and duration of calls and the body mass of the bird. The ability of an individual to recognise its mate has also been demonstrated in several species.|$|E

5|$|Zaoutzes's rise to {{prominence}} was consolidated in 891–893, {{when he was}} given the newly created title of basileopator ("father of the emperor"). His promotion to this new and enigmatic title has been a subject of controversy, as neither the reasons for the creation of the title nor its exact functions are known. The early date of his elevation precludes a relation to the eventual rise of his daughter Zoe to the imperial throne as Leo's empress. Gratitude for Zaoutzes's support against Basil may have played a role, and a common theory is that the office implied some form of tutorship over the emperor. The office certainly confirmed Zaoutzes as the senior secular official of the Byzantine Empire. However, although Zaoutzes has traditionally been regarded as an all-powerful regent over a weak emperor, <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> due to the account provided in the Vita Euthymii, the actual relationship between the two may have been quite different. A more careful evaluation of the source material has led modern scholarship to conclude that Leo was actively involved in government, and that Zaoutzes as chief minister was loyal and obsequious to his master.|$|E
5|$|As of April 2008, 38 {{species are}} {{considered}} by the IUCN to be near threatened or worse and therefore at risk of extinction. Antbirds are neither targeted by the pet trade nor {{large enough to be}} hunted; the principal cause of the decline in antbird species is habitat loss. The destruction or modification of forests has several effects on different species of antbirds. The fragmentation of forests into smaller patches affects species that are averse to crossing gaps as small as roads. If these species become locally extinct in a fragment, this reluctance to cross unforested barriers makes their re-establishment unlikely. Smaller forest fragments are unable to sustain mixed-species feeding flocks, leading to local extinctions. Another risk faced by antbirds in fragmented habitat is increased nest predation. An unplanned experiment in fragmentation occurred on Barro Colorado Island, a former hill in Panama that became an isolated island during the flooding caused by the creation of the Panama Canal. Numerous species of antbird formerly resident in the area were extirpated, <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> due to increased levels of nest predation on the island. While the species lost from Barro Colorado are not globally threatened, they illustrate the vulnerability of species in fragmented habitats and help explain the declines of some species. The majority of threatened species have very small natural ranges. Some are also extremely poorly known; for example the Rio de Janeiro antwren is known only from a single specimen collected in 1982, although there have been unconfirmed reports since 1994 and it is currently listed as critically endangered. Additionally, new species are discovered at regular intervals; the Caatinga antwren was described in 2000, the acre antshrike in 2004, the sincorá antwren in 2007, and the description of a relative of the Paraná antwren discovered in 2005 in the outskirts of São Paulo is being prepared. While not yet scientifically described, conservation efforts have already been necessary, as the site of discovery was set out to be flooded to form a reservoir. Consequently, 72 individuals were captured and transferred to another locality.|$|E
