2500|$|The {{ability to}} couple dieselâ€“electric {{locomotives}} in an MU fashion {{was first introduced}} in the EMD FT four-unit demonstrator that toured the United States in 1939. At the time, American railroad work rules required that each operating locomotive in a train had to have on board a full crew. EMD circumvented that requirement by coupling the individual units of the demonstrator with drawbars instead of conventional knuckle couplers and declaring the combination to be a single locomotive. [...] Electrical interconnections were made so one engine driver could operate the entire consist from the <b>head-end</b> <b>unit.</b> [...] Later on, work rules were amended and the semi-permanent coupling of units with drawbars was eliminated in favour of couplers, as servicing had proved to be somewhat cumbersome owing to the total length of the consist (about 200 feet or nearly 61 meters).|$|E
5000|$|The modern, {{streamlined}} trains {{were placed}} in service to represent the future of rail travel {{in contrast to the}} steam-powered DLRR which represented its past. Motive power for each train consisted of an integral <b>head-end</b> <b>unit</b> driven by an Oldsmobile [...] "Rocket" [...] V8 gasoline engine. Oldsmobile also furnished the windscreen, doors and instrument console for each of the two 5,000 lb (2,300 kg) locomotives. The attraction operated until September 15, 1958, when construction began on the Matterhorn and Submarine Voyage; the Disneyland Monorail System took the place of the Viewliner in June of the following year.|$|E

50|$|Some of the WDP-4B/WDP-4D {{locomotives}} {{have been}} spotted having a provision for an inverter-driven <b>head-end</b> power <b>unit</b> which allows trains {{to be run}} without an End-on generating car (EOG) for hotel power.|$|R
50|$|Only first-series T Class {{locomotives}} were {{suitable for}} upgrading because their frames {{were designed for}} EMD 12-567 engines, with only 2/3rds of the length used {{to cut down on}} weight (and allow a Bo-Bo, instead of A1A-A1A or Co-Co wheel arrangement). When rebuilt, the 8-645 engine took the place formerly occupied by the 8-567, and the remaining space was utilised for the <b>head-end</b> power <b>unit.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The modern, {{streamlined}} trains {{were placed}} into service {{to represent the}} future of rail travel, {{in contrast to the}} steam-powered DRR which represented its past. Motive power for each train consisted of an integral <b>head-end</b> <b>unit</b> driven by a Chevrolet 265 cu in (4.3 L) displacement V8 gasoline engine, mated to a Jeep transfer case powering drive-shafts to both the front and rear wheel trucks. Two 1954 Oldsmobile 88 2-dr coupes furnished the windscreen, doors and instrument console for each of the two 5,000 lb locomotives. The attraction operated until September 30, 1958 when construction began on the Matterhorn and Submarine Voyage. The Disneyland Monorail System ultimately took the place of the Viewliner in June 1959, thereby {{making it one of the}} shortest-lived rides in the park's history. The railroad ties from the attraction were later used to build the Deer Lake Park & Julian Railroad, a [...] narrow-gauge backyard railroad owned by Disney animator Ollie Johnston at his vacation home near Julian, California.|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{introduction}} of the HTR Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) fuel cycle, the behavior of the U 0 $_{ 2 }$ TRISO-coated fuel particle was investigated in the various <b>HEAD-END</b> <b>unit</b> operations. The potential impact of this particle design on the <b>HEAD-END</b> <b>unit</b> operations was evaluated. The oxidation behavior of uncoated U 0 $_{ 2 }$ kernels was characterized in both static and fluidized bed combustion tests. It was shown that the oxidation of U 0 $_{ 2 }$ to U$_{ 3 }$ 0 $_{ 8 }$ in a fluid bed produced U$_{ 3 }$ 0 $_{ 8 }$fragments with no significant generation of fines. It was demonstrated that sintered metal blow-back filters efficiently separated the fines produced from the burner off-gas stream with no significant heavy metal loss. Using unirradiated TRISO-coated U 02 particles, the radioactive inventory of the SiC coating fragments, which are a waste stream from fluid-bed burning, were determined. The measurements showed that the SiC fragments must be classified as "long-lived, highly radioactive, alpha-containing" waste, and thus its heat generation rate must be considered. A possible conditioning might be hotpressing and sintering using a vitreous or ceramic powder matrix. The use of a jet mill to crush the SiC coating after burning of the matrix graphite was investigated. Crushing experiments with unirradiated particles demonstrated excellent efficiency in both coating breakage and kernel-coating separation. Because of this, it is proposed to utilize a jet mill to replace both the roll crushing and secondary burning steps in the reference HEAD-END process...|$|E
