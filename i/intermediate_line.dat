Three colors were available. 50 of these rare cars were built. In 1978, GM downsized its <b>intermediate</b> <b>line</b> and decided to apply the Malibu name to the whole range as it had higher recognition among buyers than Chevelle.|$|E
25|$|By {{the morning}} of 2 July, X Corps had gained a small {{foothold}} in the Leipzig Salient {{and part of the}} German front line opposite the 36th Division. The extent of British casualties north of the Albert–Bapaume road was not known at the Fourth Army headquarters and General Henry Rawlinson ordered that attacks were to continue. X Corps and VIII Corps to the north, were to capture the German front position and the <b>intermediate</b> <b>line</b> from Mouquet Farm to Serre. Gough was sent to take over command of X Corps and VIII Corps and the 25th Division (Major-General Guy Bainbridge) was transferred from reserve to X Corps. Gough had intended to attack Thiepval with the 49th and 32nd divisions and the 48th Division of VIII Corps but eventually changes of plan, led to the attack being reduced to two brigades of the 32nd Division.|$|E
25|$|In a first phase, the 7th and 21st {{divisions}} were {{to capture}} high ground {{either side of}} the Willow Stream and Mametz. In the second phase, Fricourt was to be occupied and the advance pressed over the spurs to the first German intermediate line; the British were to dig in along the second <b>intermediate</b> <b>line,</b> which ran across the valley south of Mametz Wood. The troops were to gain touch with the XIII Corps at White Trench and at Quadrangle Trench, to the west, with III Corps. The second phase position was considered to be easy to defend against a counter-attack and provide a good view for artillery observers and covered positions for field artillery. If the two phases succeeded, the 17th (Northern) Division would join the attacking divisions to attack through Mametz Wood and up Caterpillar Valley to take Ginchy, Longueval and Bazentin-le-Grand. To avoid a frontal attack against Fricourt and the wood behind, the village was to be isolated by the first attacks and captured later. The right-hand brigade of the 7th Division was to capture Mametz and advance to White Trench and the centre brigade was to form a defensive flank {{on the south side of}} Willow Stream. The left-hand brigade of the 21st Division was to cross the Fricourt spur and advance to Bottom Wood as the central brigade formed another defensive flank opposite the village and Fricourt Wood, ready for both brigades to attack as decided by the corps commander.|$|E

500|$|The song {{starts with}} a C major chord {{sequence}} and is used on the flattened seventh key of the sequence. But the actual key of the song is D major. It {{is set in a}} time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. Madonna's voice spans from F3 to G4. A much stronger arrangement of drums are used in the second verse. The chorus uses the chord sequence of D–G–Bm–A while the first two lines of each verse uses the chord progression of C–D–C–D7–C–D–Bm–A. During the <b>intermediate</b> <b>line</b> [...] "I learned {{to let go of the}} illusion that we can possess", the structure changes to D/F–Bm–G–D–A–G–A. Backing vocals are used on the later choruses for support with the strings, cascading down to a minor arrangement before the third one. The song ends with fading out and devoid of any musical climax.|$|E
500|$|The German {{front line}} regiments held areas [...] wide with one (...) {{battalion}} forward, one (...) battalion in {{support and the}} third in reserve [...] back.

2500|$|Buick {{had been}} the first GM {{division}} to bring a personal luxury car to market with its full-size 1963 Riviera, but was otherwise slow to react to the developing lower-priced mid-size personal luxury market, which Pontiac created with the 1969 Grand Prix and Chevrolet with the Monte Carlo the following year, 1970. At the same time, Oldsmobile added a formal notchback coupé to its <b>intermediate</b> <b>line,</b> the Cutlass Supreme, in 1970 and that model soon became Olds' best selling intermediate. Buick did not get its own personal luxury coupe until the GM intermediates were redesigned in 1973, the so-called [...] "Colonnade" [...] cars that eliminated hardtop models completely. In a curious name swap, the Skylark name was dropped from Buick's <b>intermediate</b> <b>line</b> and instead the Century nameplate, last used in the 1950s, was revived for them.|$|E

50|$|Most large drip {{irrigation}} systems employ {{some type of}} filter to prevent clogging of the small emitter flow path by small waterborne particles. New technologies are now being offered that minimize clogging. Some residential systems are installed without additional filters, since potable water is already filtered at the water treatment plant. Virtually all {{drip irrigation}} equipment manufacturers recommend that filters be employed and generally will not honor warranties unless this is done. Last line filters just before the final delivery pipe are strongly recommended in addition to any other filtration system due to fine particle settlement and accidental insertion of particles in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|From 1977 to 1982, in order, General Motors would {{physically}} downsize its full-size, intermediate, compact, and subcompact vehicle {{product lines}} {{in the process of}} vehicle redesigns. For 1977, all five GM car divisions ( [...] Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac) saw the downsizing of their full-size vehicle lines, with an average length reduction of 12 inches and 750-800 pounds in weight (with over 1000 pounds in some examples). While producing a smaller exterior footprint than the GM <b>intermediate</b> product <b>lines,</b> the full-size cars would see similar interior dimensions as their predecessors. For 1978, the GM <b>intermediate</b> product <b>line</b> (based on the GM A platform) became true mid-size cars with similar size reductions.|$|R
40|$|Insulin-like {{growth factor}} (IGF-I) is an {{anabolic}} growth factor for bone formation. To explore the local effect of IGF-I on bone remodeling, transgenic mice were developed having bone-directed overexpression of FLAG epitope tagged murine IGF-I {{driven by a}} 3. 6 kb fragment of the col 1 a 1 gene (pOBCol 3. 6 -IGF). ^ Transgene expression was first demonstrated in vitro. Five CD- 1 pOBCol 3. 6 IGF lines were generated. Transgenic mice appeared healthy, bred normally and had growth rates similar to wild-type littermates. Analysis of transgene mRNA expression indicated that the transgene was targeted to bone tissue, with some extent of expression in tendon and skin. Transgene mRNA expression was strong in young animals and then gradually decreased. The level of transgene mRNA expression varied among the different founder lines. ^ The level of transgene expression was correlated with the bone phenotype in three independent founder lines. Percent collagen synthesis (PCS) in calvarial cultures was significantly greater in both the high and <b>intermediate</b> expressing <b>lines</b> than in wild-type. However, PCS of the low expressing line was not different than wild-type. Static histomorphometry showed that 8 -week old transgenic calvariae from the high and <b>intermediate</b> expressing <b>lines</b> were significantly wider and had greater marrow area and osteoclast number/bone area than wild-type calvariae; however, calvariae from the low expressing line and wild-type mice were similar. Calvariae of the <b>intermediate</b> expressing <b>line</b> maintained the phenotype at 7 months. Eight-week old transgenic femurs had increased cortical width. Trabecular bone was increased and decreased in the high and <b>intermediate</b> expressing <b>lines,</b> respectively. There was no {{significant change in the}} low expressing line. ^ To assess bone resorption in vitro, calvariae from 2 – 4 day-old neonatal mice were labeled in utero with [45 Ca] and cultured ex vivo. In 5 day cultures, the release of [45 Ca] was significantly higher in transgenic calvariae from the <b>intermediate</b> expressing <b>line.</b> To assess ostoeclastogenesis, bone marrow cells were cultured in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF. Osteoclast formation was 2 -fold greater in bone marrow cultures from transgenic mice compared to wild-type mice. ^ In summary, pOBCol 3. 6 -IGF mice showed transgene dose-dependent bone phenotype that likely reflects simulation of bone resorption and formation by osteoblast-directed IGF-I expression. ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{attack was}} planned as an advance in stages, {{to keep the}} {{infantry}} well {{under the protection of}} the field artillery. II Corps was to reach the green line of 31 July, an advance of about [...] and form a defensive flank from Stirling Castle to Black Watch Corner. The deeper objective was compensated for by reducing battalion frontages from [...] and leap-frogging supporting battalions through an <b>intermediate</b> <b>line,</b> to take the final objective.|$|E
2500|$|The 11th (Northern) Division {{attacked}} at [...] {{with two}} brigades and ten tanks of 'D' battalion, 1st tank Brigade. On the right the advance took Malta House and reached an <b>intermediate</b> <b>line</b> {{where a small}} counter-attack was stopped. Fire from {{the church and the}} Brewery pillbox in Poelcappelle caused a delay but Gloster Farm was captured with the aid of two tanks and the red line (first objective) consolidated. Troops from the inner flanks of both brigades and several tanks entered Poelcappelle and then captured pillboxes beyond the east end. The left brigade had advanced easily to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>line</b> and then overcame small parties of German infantry concealed in shell-holes. A shelter was captured near the church in Poelcappelle amid sniper fire. Ferdan House was captured and the final objective consolidated. A defensive flank was thrown back to maintain touch with the 4th Division to the north, whose advance had been pushed back [...] by German counter-attacks. A counter-attack in the 11th (Northern) Division area at [...] was defeated and reinforcements allowed the new line to be established between the Steenbeek and the Langemarck–Winnipeg road.|$|E

Distant reconnaissance continued, despite the danger of interception by superior German aircraft, to observe the German fortification building behind the Somme and Arras fronts, which had been detected in November 1916. On 25 February, reconnaissance crews brought news of numerous fires burning behind the German front line, {{all the way back}} to the new fortifications.

The 50th Brigade was to be ready to attack Fricourt, if the enveloping attacks on the flanks failed, except for the left-hand battalion, which was to attack to form a defensive flank facing the village. The 21st Division brigades were to advance to the first objective at Crucifix Trench, the German <b>intermediate</b> <b>line</b> and then continue to the second objective at Bottom Wood and Quadrangle Trench, in the second German <b>intermediate</b> <b>line,</b> to link with troops from the 7th Division. The 10th Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment, attacked on a front of [...] and the first two companies reached the German front trench with few casualties, then pressed on to Red Cottage {{at the north end of}} Fricourt. The rest of the battalion was caught by machine-guns in the village and German Tambour, which had survived the mine explosions and were forward of the creeping barrage. The two companies were practically annihilated and only a few troops reached the front trench. The companies at Red Cottage were overrun later in the morning, only a few groups managing to reach the 63rd Brigade to the north.
