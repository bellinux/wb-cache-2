25|$|A pillow or sex pillow (especially a firm one) can be used, {{to alter}} the depth and angle of penetration. A wedge- or ramp-shaped pillow can relieve {{pressure}} on the top person's hands and arms. Placing a pillow under the woman's buttocks can lift her pelvis—a Playboy article suggested placing it under <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> to increase pressure on the clitoris. Each of these methods can increase the depth of penetration. Raising the clitoris generally allows easier access to it in this position. Using a pillow can also help the woman arch her back and avoid backache.|$|E
25|$|Tom Wlaschiha is cast as Jaqen H'ghar, {{a mysterious}} {{prisoner}} who develops a murderous relationship with young Arya Stark (Maisie Williams). Wlaschiha's pronunciation of his character's name, Jack-in, was adopted {{for use in}} the show. Natalie Dormer, best known for her portrayal as seductive Anne Boleyn in Showtime's The Tudors, was cast in a similar role as Margaery Tyrell, a noblewoman and the wife of the third claimant to the throne, Renly Baratheon. Gwendoline Christie played, to much praise, Brienne of Tarth, a female warrior who joins Renly Baratheon's guard, but later becomes a follower of Catelyn Stark. To prepare for the role, Christie took up an intense training regimen, adding over a stone (6.4kg) of muscle mass. So that she could be mistaken for a man, her armor was decorated with lines that slant away from <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b> On {{the other side of the}} fictional world, two female roles with rising prominence were added to the cast: Skins star Hannah Murray filled the role of Craster's daughter Gilly, a love interest to Samwell Tarly; while the second role, the one of Ygritte, Jon Snow's love interest among the Wildlings, was played by Rose Leslie.|$|E

25|$|The figure {{behind the}} daughter, Clotilde Sorolla, also wears a white dress, <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> accented {{by a white}} belt. Thus both the breasts and the {{buttocks}} have clearer contours than the daughter's. Clothilde's dress has cropped sleeves, and she carries a jacket, also made of white fabric, on her left forearm {{in front of her}} abdomen. In her left hand she holds an open white parasol, which is angled to the ground on the left side. Under Clotilde's dress are two elegant white women's shoes with small heels. On her head Clotilde wears a straw hat, which is also decorated with purple colored flowers. In addition, a greenish-transparent veil is draped over the entire hat, and falls forward over her face and is blown backward almost horizontally in the wind. Clotilde has bent her right arm upward and her hand lies on the veil. This creates the impression that she must adjust it due to the wind veil or even hold it in place. Of the head of Clotilde little can be seen. Large parts of face, depicted in profile, are in shadow and only the chin is in brighter sunlight. Also, the wide sweeping hat obscures the hair almost completely. Just behind a pearl earring is a bit of dark hair. While the young face of the daughter Maria is looks directly into the sun, the face of the mother is hidden by the shadow of the hat. The clothes and accessories show the two women to be members of the upper class spending their free time in the summer with mild temperatures and light winds.|$|E
500|$|Monroe {{starred in}} three movies that were {{released}} in 1953 and {{emerged as a}} major sex symbol and one of Hollywood's most bankable performers. The first of these was the Technicolor film noir Niagara, in which she played a femme fatale scheming to murder her husband, played by Joseph Cotten. By then, Monroe and her make-up artist Allan [...] "Whitey" [...] Snyder had developed the make-up look that became associated with her: dark arched brows, pale skin, [...] "glistening" [...] red lips and a beauty mark. According to Sarah Churchwell, Niagara {{was one of the}} most overtly sexual films of Monroe's career, and it included scenes in which her body was covered only by a sheet or a towel, considered shocking by contemporary audiences. Its most famous scene is a 30-second long shot of Monroe shown walking from behind with <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> swaying, which was heavily used in the film's marketing.|$|E
500|$|For the {{character}} of Giselle, her journey to becoming a real woman is reflected in her dresses, which become less fairy tale-like as the film progresses. Her wedding dress {{at the beginning of}} the film directly contrasts her modern gown at the end of the film. The wedding dress served to provide a [...] "humongous contrast to the flat drawings" [...] and to accentuate the image of a Disney Princess. In order to make the waist look small, the sleeves are designed to be [...] "extremely pouffy" [...] and the skirt to be as big as possible, which included a metal hoop that holds up 20 layers of petticoats and ruffles. Altogether, eleven versions of the dress are made for filming, each made of 200 yards (183 m) of silk satin and other fabric, and weighing approximately 40 pounds (18kg). On the experience of wearing the wedding dress, Amy Adams described it as [...] "grueling" [...] since [...] "the entire weight was on <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> so occasionally it felt like she was in traction".|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} heavily derided by critics. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard panned it as [...] "even more {{abhorrent}} than the song." [...] While acknowledging that the album's previous videos were [...] "excellent", {{he pointed out}} that the [...] "Hello Kitty" [...] video [...] "tries to do nothing. Its laziness is demonstrated in the first 21 seconds, during which Lavigne holds a plush stack of cupcakes, shakes <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> stares at the cupcakes, bounces her shoulders, and then, when she sings the line 'Someone chuck a cupcake at me'... tosses the fake cupcakes at the camera, her lip movement not matching up to the backing track whatsoever." [...] Alexa Camp of Slant Magazine called it [...] "truly eyebrow-raising, taking cultural mis-appropriation to cringe-inducing levels." [...] The Independent suggested that [...] "'Hello Kitty' will make your eyes and ears bleed", while Jezebel wrote: [...] "It looks like what would happen if someone scraped off the diseased underbelly of American pop culture from 2004-2010 and sprinkled it generously over a festering pile of garbage." ...|$|E

After leaving the toilet, Lee discovered Phagan's body {{in the rear of the}} basement near an incinerator and called the police. Her dress was up around her waist and a strip from her petticoat had been torn off and wrapped around her neck. Her face was blackened and scratched, and her head was bruised and battered. A [...] strip of [...] wrapping cord was tied into a loop around her neck, buried [...] deep, showing that she had been strangled. Her underwear was still around <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> but stained with blood and torn open. Her skin was covered with ashes and dirt from the floor, initially making it appear to responding officers that she and her assailant had struggled in the basement.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Cassidy had a {{malignant}} mole removed from her back {{but did not}} follow up with regular check-up appointments. Three years later, during a promotional event for the Live at Blues Alley album in July 1996, Cassidy noticed an ache in <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> which she attributed to stiffness from painting murals while perched atop a stepladder. The pain persisted and X-rays revealed a fracture. Further tests found that cancer had spread to her bones, causing the fracture, {{as well as to}} her lungs. Her doctors estimated she had three to five months to live. Cassidy opted for aggressive treatment, but her health deteriorated rapidly. On September 17, at a benefit concert for her at the Bayou, she made her final public appearance, closing the set with [...] "What a Wonderful World" [...] {{in front of an audience}} of family, friends, and fans. [...] Additional chemotherapy was ineffective and Cassidy died on November 2, 1996 at her family's home in Bowie, Maryland. In accordance with her wishes, her body was cremated and the ashes were scattered on the lake shores of St. Mary's River Watershed Park, a nature reserve near Callaway, Maryland.|$|E

500|$|While {{reviewing}} Beyoncé's {{performance at}} the Madison Square Garden in Manhattan, on August 5, 2007, Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Beyoncé needs no distractions from her singing, which can be airy or brassy, tearful or vicious, rapid-fire with staccato syllables or sustained in curlicued melismas. But she was in constant motion, strutting in costumes." [...] Shaheem Reid of MTV News compared the performance with Michael Buffer further adding that [...] "Beyoncé acknowledged Shakira by shaking <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> rapidly". While reviewing Beyoncé's performance of the song in Saskatoon on September 14, 2007, a writer of The StarPhoenix noted {{that it was one}} of the musical surprises during the evening. Jim Harrington from the San Jose Mercury News noted that Beyoncé's all-female band provided [...] "plenty of punch" [...] to the live performance of the song in Fresno on August 28, 2007 further noting that the singer looked like a [...] "sex kitten purring through" [...] the song. In Los Angeles, on September 2, Beyoncé performed [...] "Beautiful Liar", dressed in a green belly dancing outfit, with several female backup dancers, and live instrumentation. [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] was included on Beyoncé's live album The Beyoncé Experience Live (2007).|$|E
500|$|Mars {{performed}} the song, {{aside from the}} tour, at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards (VMA's) and 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards (EMA's). On the latter, he recreated his provocative music video with Nicole “The Pole” Williams. During these performances there was a green color scheme with a neon sign pulsating in the background with the same color. At the 2013 MTV VMA's, Mars was standing high up on a platform, while wearing a [...] "leopard-print button-down". Whilst there was a screen with a giant gorilla face behind him and lasers firing through the stage. He kicked his mic stand over and over, while his band was jamming along. Meanwhile, some pyrotechnics [...] "shooting off at the climax" [...] and [...] "blasts of fire erupted during the chorus". At the 2013 MTV EMA's, Mars had a similar style too Lou Reed and aviator sunglasses. On this performance, his face was [...] "superimposed" [...] over Williams dancing around a stripper pole with [...] "acrobatic ease" [...] and [...] "breathtaking moves {{in time to the}} song". During the bridge of the song, the singer played a guitar solo while Williams stand in the crab position thrusting <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> towards Mars' guitar in the same tempo. The song was the final act on both set lists of The Moonshine Jungle Tour (2013-2015).|$|E
500|$|Glenn Gamboa of Newsday {{found that}} Hilson gets {{incredibly}} riled up on [...] "The Way You Love Me". Rob Sheffield chose [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] {{as one of}} the high points that are worth digging out and called its content [...] "electro-porn." [...] Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "raunchy" [...] one. Chris Parkin Yahoo! Music commented that the [...] "fantastic banger 'The Way you Love Me' , [...] filthy song, that makes like the oversexed, doolally cousin of Beyoncé Knowles' [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] (2003). Idolator's staff members described [...] "The Way you Love Me" [...] as a [...] "pretty much the definition of down-and-dirty, adequately conveying a sexual energy perfect for, shall we say, a 'particular' type of dancing." [...] They also said that vocals of Hilson sound [...] "less like it was recorded during the throes of passion and more like someone just cut her off on the freeway". However, they ended up saying that the song works. Neil Miller, Jr. of UR Chicago called [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] an undeniable standout on the record thanks to its [...] "serious bass to rattle your trunk, some tweaked out synth stabs, and Hilson's bad bitch attitude." [...] By contrast, Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine said that it seems that Hilson has begun trusting her ability [...] "to thrust <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> toward recoiling cameras more than she believes in the power of her vocal track." ...|$|E

500|$|James Montgomery from MTV {{commented that}} [...] "it's a little {{surprising}} that the just-released clip for Beyoncé's 'Video Phone' has nary a flame or fish-eye shot (there are, of course, plenty of outlandish costumes). However, don't {{make the mistake of}} thinking this video is by any means straightforward— it's plenty WTF! [...] It's definitely not the Gaga we're used to seeing, but her appearance isn't exactly run-of-the-mill, either. And neither is this video, for that matter. Especially not when you're watching Beyoncé snap her gum and shake <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> and grope an AK-47 while the screen pops from electric green to Kool-Aid red." [...] Jocelyn Vena of the same publication noted, [...] "The clip is charged with energy, and the cynics out there might wonder if putting two sizzling divas in a room together created any kind of rivalry." [...] Jim Farber from New York's Daily News compared Knowles' look to that of pin-up model Bettie Page, and said [...] "The clip for 'Video Phone' [...] doesn't offer {{much in the way of}} chemistry or even interaction between the two divas. [...] clip seems about as innovative as a rotary dial up." [...] Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone commented that the video was an [...] "almost seizure-inducing parade of cinematic homages and wardrobe changes." [...] He also compared Knowles' look to Page, as well as Katy Perry and rapper M.I.A. The Daily Mail gave a positive review of the video, calling it avant-garde and naughty.|$|E
500|$|Biographer Taraborrelli commented, [...] "Madonna {{had more}} {{confidence}} in her stage presence, her music was showing a deeper maturity, her voice was fuller, and the show was expertly choreographed with complex numbers. J. D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun commented, [...] "I've seen the Springsteen stadium tour, I've seen Dylan and the [...] Dead, and I was at Live Aid. Out of all those shows, Madonna's {{is the only one}} I want to see again. You need a larger-than-life show if you want to come off in a stadium, and Madonna does. She's not that large physically, but she holds your attention." [...] Ann Ayers, assistant entertainment editor of USA Today felt that the show was high on glitz and low on emotional quotient. [...] "Madonna's going for a certain kind of show: a Broadway, show-biz, song-and-dance spectacle. In that context it's hard to make a connection with the audience, and I'd have to say that she didn't." [...] Peter Goddard from Toronto Star reviewed the concert in CNE Stadium and said, [...] "Madonna proved that she may be a lost girl in the roads of life, like her film, but she ain't lost when she is singing. Especially during songs like 'Papa Don't Preach', her vocal prowess was substantially notable." [...] Scott A Zamost and Elizabeth Snead, writing for Chicago Tribune, felt that [...] "For the most part, the premiere concert on Madonna's Who's That Girl tour was a success, an extravaganza of multiple videos, flashing lights and precision dancing. If the high-tech accoutrements and inferior sound system made it difficult to hear the singer, one hopes that will be refined as the tour continues across the United States. [...] As a dancer, Madonna is supreme on stage. Her trademark skip to a funky beat highlighted the constant acrobatics. One minute she was stage left, another minute stage right. She ran up a wide staircase center stage to party with her three back-up singers, then scooted down to the stage floor, swinging <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> accompanied by other dancers." ...|$|E
500|$|Previewing Street Fighter III, Computer and Video Games {{highlighted}} Ibuki and Necro as [...] "two of the finest" [...] {{fighters in}} the game. In 2008, GameDaily placed Ibuki 15th on {{its list of}} top Street Fighter characters of all time, expressing surprise that [...] "all {{she wants to do}} is live a normal life." [...] That same year, IGN's D. F. Smith ranked her as the 22nd top Street Fighter character and the only ninja on their list. In 2015, Ben Lee from Digital Spy ranked the [...] "fast, relentless, kick-ass, and often unpredictable" [...] Ibuki as the 12th best Street Fighter character. IGN's Jesse Schedeen featured her among the characters he wanted to appear in Street Fighter IV. GamesRadar's Mikel Reparaz similarly listed Ibuki among the 12 characters {{he would like to see}} in Super Street Fighter IV despite her being [...] "one of the weaker characters" [...] in Street Fighter III, citing her [...] "enduring popularity", [...] "rapid, skill-centric combos and high-flying special moves" [...] and her costume [...] "which leaves <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> conspicuously bare and devoid of any sign of underpants." [...] Martin Robinson of AskMen too named Ibuki as of the five characters it wished to be included in Super Street Fighter IV, writing that [...] "ninjas might be ten-a-penny in videogames, but none are as effortlessly cool as Ibuki" [...] and adding that she [...] "makes this list primarily for her style" [...] but is [...] "no slouch in combat either." [...] According to the GameZone review of the game, [...] "it’s unfathomable to think that anyone could not fall in love with Ibuki and Makoto, introduced in Street Fighter III, all over again." [...] In his review of Super Street Fighter IV, Tim Higgins from The Telegraph wrote Ibuki was his personal favourite new fighter in the game for [...] "all slippery evasive manoeuvres and devastating bread and butter combos." [...] GamesRadar's Lucas Sullivan called her inclusion in Street Fighter IV [...] "a stroke of genius" [...] and requested her return in Street Fighter V.|$|E
