5000|$|Essentially, the {{perfective}} aspect {{looks at}} an event as a <b>complete</b> <b>action,</b> while the imperfective aspect views an event as the process of unfolding or a repeated or habitual event (thus corresponding to the progressive/continuous aspect for events of short-term duration and to habitual aspect for longer terms). For events of short durations in the past, the distinction often coincides with the distinction in the English language between the simple past [...] "X-ed," [...] {{as compared to the}} progressive [...] "was X-ing" [...] (compare [...] "I wrote the letters this morning" [...] (i.e. finished writing the letters: an <b>action</b> <b>completed)</b> and [...] "I was writing letters this morning"). In describing longer time periods, English needs context to maintain the distinction between the habitual ("I called him often in the past" [...] - a habit that has no point of completion) and perfective ("I called him once" [...] - an <b>action</b> <b>completed),</b> although the construct [...] "used to" [...] marks both habitual aspect and past tense and can be used if the aspectual distinction otherwise is not clear.|$|R
