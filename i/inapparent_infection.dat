The infections include not only the Australian cricket species but the New Zealand cricket, Pteronemobius nigrovus, as well as the European house cricket, Acheta domesticus. CrPV does not appear to infect locusts. It is a commonly detected virus in honeybees as an <b>inapparent</b> <b>infection.</b> The strain CrPVbrk was isolated from the cricket A. domesticus ca.1980 following a major population collapse at a cricket rearing farm in Georgia. A related virus from Arkansas, initially called Pseudoplusia includens virus and redesignated CrPVark, was recorded in the mid-1980s. The brk and ark strains are closely related serologically but appear to be very distantly related to the other CrPV isolates so, despite their physical and chemical similarities, it remains speculative that these two American isolates are actually strains of CrPV. Reported detections and/or isolations of CrPV have been made in Australia, New Zealand, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Indonesia. CrPV has one of the widest host-ranges, if not the widest, of any virus, insect or not. The potential for the use of CrPV as a biological control agent for insects has been suggested.

The activated viruses replicated to detectable concentrations after pupae were incubated at 35 °C for 3 days. <b>Inapparent</b> <b>infections</b> of SBV, {{but not the}} other viruses, were also activated merely by incubating pupae at 35 °C. The replication of activated BQCV, KBV or SBV was specifically suppressed by injecting pupae with rabbit antisera against he particles of each virus.

In addition, a greater proportion of activated BQCV infections occurred in pupae in which the replication of both KBV and SBV was suppressed than in groups of pupae that were not injected with KBV and SBV antisera. Results from one group of pupae treated in this way indicated that about 40 ~ were infected with KBV, about 43 ~ with SBV and about 15 ~ with BQCV.

40|$|Poliomyelitis is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} disease caused by three serotypes of poliovirus. Infection with poliovirus results in a spectrum of clinical manifestations from <b>inapparent</b> <b>infection</b> to nonspecific febrile illness, aseptic meningitis, paralytic disease, and death. Two phases of acute poliomyelitis can be distinguished: a nonspecific febrile illness (minor illness) followed, in {{a small proportion of}} patients, by aseptic meningitis and/or paralytic disease (major illness). The ratio of cases of <b>inapparent</b> <b>infection</b> to paralytic disease among susceptible individuals ranges from 100 : 1 to 1000 : 1 or more. Following poliovirus exposure, viral replication occurs in the oropharynx and the intestinal tract. Viremia follows, which may result in infection of central nervous system cells. The virus attaches and enters cells via a specific poliovirus receptor. Replication of poliovirus in motor neurons of the anterior horn and brain stem results in cell destruction and causes the typical clinical manifestations of poliomyelitis. Depending on the site of infection and paralysis, poliomyelitis can be classified as spinal, bulbar, or spino-bulbar disease. Progression to maximum paralysis is rapid (2 – 4 days), usually associated with fever and muscle pain, and rarely progresses after the temperature has returned to normal.

When blood from infected guinea pigs or chorioallantoic fluid from infected eggs was inoculated subcutaneously or intranasally into young calves, fever with albuminuria and more rarely hemoglobinuria was produced, in lactating cows the infection resembled that seen in animals with natural disease.

40|$|In many {{infectious}} diseases, {{an unknown}} fraction of infections produce symptoms mild {{enough to go}} unrecorded, a fact that can seriously compromise the interpretation of epidemiological records. This is true for cholera, a pandemic bacterial disease, where estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100 (refs 1 - 5). In the absence of direct evidence, understanding of fundamental aspects of cholera transmission, immunology and control {{has been based on}} assumptions about this ratio and about the immunological consequences of <b>inapparent</b> <b>infections.</b> Here we show that a model incorporating high asymptomatic ratio and rapidly waning immunity, with infection both from human and environmental sources, explains 50 yr of mortality data from 26 districts of Bengal, the pathogen's endemic home. We find that the asymptomatic ratio in cholera is far higher than had been previously supposed and that the immunity derived from mild infections wanes much more rapidly than earlier analyses have indicated. We find, too, that the environmental reservoir(5, 6) (free-living pathogen) is directly responsible for relatively few infections but that it may be critical to the disease's endemicity. Our results demonstrate that <b>inapparent</b> <b>infections</b> can hold the key to interpreting the patterns of disease outbreaks. New statistical methods(7), which allow rigorous maximum likelihood inference based on dynamical models incorporating multiple sources and outcomes of infection, seasonality, process noise, hidden variables and measurement error, make it possible to test more precise hypotheses and obtain unexpected results.

Infected guinea-pigs show macroscopic and microscopic haemorrhagic lesions, marked bone marrow changes, decreased leukocytes and platelets in the peripheral blood, and impairment of immunological response. This response permits differentiation between pathogenic (XJ) and attenuated (XJ Cl 3) strains. Guinea-pigs inoculated with the XJ Cl 3 strain develop an <b>inapparent</b> <b>infection</b> accompanied by slight haematological changes, the appearance of antibody, and protection against challenge with the pathogenic strain.

Suckling mice infected with Junin virus develop a typical viral encephalitis; the pathogenicity of the virus decreases with increasing age of the mice. Experiments with thymectomized mice and with mice treated with antithymocyte serum suggest that the pathogenicity of Junin virus in this host is related to the integrity of the thymus-dependent immune system.

40|$|Persistent {{infection}} of equids by equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is typically {{characterized by a}} progression {{during the first year}} postinfection from chronic disease with recurring disease cycles to a long-term asymptomatic infection that is maintained indefinitely. The goal of the current study was to perform a comprehensive longitudinal analysis of the course of virus infection and development of host immunity in experimentally infected horses as they progressed from chronic disease to long-term inapparent carriage. We previously described the evolution of EIAV genomic quasispecies (C. Leroux, C. J. Issel, and R. C. Montelaro, J. Virol. 71 : 9627 – 9639, 1997) and host immune responses (S. A. Hammond, S. J. Cook, D. L. Lichtenstein, C. J. Issel, and R. C. Montelaro, J. Virol. 71 : 3840 – 3852, 1997) in four experimentally infected ponies during sequential disease episodes associated with chronic disease during the first 10 months postinfection. In the current study, we extended the studies of these experimentally infected ponies to 3 years postinfection to characterize the levels of virus replication and development of host immune responses associated with the progression from chronic disease to long-term <b>inapparent</b> <b>infection.</b> The results of these studies revealed over a 103 -fold difference in the steady-state levels of plasma viral RNA detected during long-term <b>inapparent</b> <b>infection</b> that correlated with the severity of chronic disease, indicating different levels of control of virus replication during long-term inapparent infections. Detailed analyses of antibody and cellular immune responses in all four ponies over the 3 -year course of infection revealed a similar evolution during the first year post{{infection of}} robust humoral and cellular immunity that then remained relatively constant during long-term <b>inapparent</b> <b>infection.</b> These observations indicate that immune parameters that have previously been correlated with EIAV vaccine protection fail to provide reliable immune correlates of control of virus replication or clinical outcome in experimental infections.

40|$|Despite the {{advances}} made {{since the advent}} of germ theory, infectious diseases still wreak havoc on human societies, not only affecting us directly but impacting the crops and livestock upon which we rely. Infectious diseases also have dramatic effects on wildlife ecology. Therefore research into infectious diseases could not only directly lead to the improvement and saving of human lives, but aid in food security and the conservation of many wildlife species. Of vital importance in understanding the ecology of infectious diseases are the mechanisms by which they persist in host populations. One possible mechanism is vertical transmission: the transmission of a pathogen from a parent to its offspring {{as a result of the}} process of host reproduction. Another possible mechanism is inapparant infections, where an infected host does not display symptoms. Focusing on dengue fever and the Plodia interpunctella granulovirus laboratory system, this PhD thesis looks at the role these two mechanisms play on the persistence of two viral infections and their ecology. Regarding the Plodia interpunctella granulovirus (PiGV) low host food quality led to greater detection of vertically transmitted inapparant PiGV, but did not lead to its activation to an apparent form. Host inbreeding did not lead to vertically transmitted inapparant PiGV’s activation, nor had an effect on its vertical transmission. The vertical infection rate of PiGV was very low. I would therefore suggest that it may be better to use an insect virus system with a higher rate of vertical infection in future research into vertically transmitting <b>inapparent</b> <b>infections.</b> Regarding dengue virus I conclude that vertical transmission is not likely to play a role in the persistence of this virus. However modelling work found that <b>inapparent</b> <b>infections</b> could provide dengue viruses with a means of persistence and should be subject to further research...|$|R
