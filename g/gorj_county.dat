25|$|He {{became a}} member of the PNL in 1895, the same year he ran in {{elections}} and was elected to the Parliament of Romania by the Ist College (of the landed gentry) in <b>Gorj</b> <b>County.</b> In early 1899, he was in the majority that voted in favor of the entry of former members of the Romanian Social-Democratic Workers' Party into the PNL. He served as Minister of Public Works (March 31, 1897-March 30, 1899; February 14, 1901-July 18, 1902) and Minister of the Interior (March 12, 1907-December 27, 1908) - the latter assignment was prompted by the effects of the 1907 Peasants' Revolt. In 1909, he was elected head of the National Liberals, a position he was to hold until his death; he first became Prime Minister in January 1909, and kept the office until December 28, 1910.|$|E

25|$|The family {{belonged to}} the low-ranking boyar {{aristocracy}} of Oltenia, and more specifically <b>Gorj</b> <b>County,</b> tracing their origins to the yeoman Bibul. Its first influential member had been Alexandru's grandfather, Logothete Dumitrachi Bibescu, whose life coincided {{with the end of}} Phanariote rule and the ascendancy of native or assimilated boyars. A protege of Prince Grigore IV Ghica in the 1820s, he married Ecaterina, granddaughter of the boyaress Safta Brâncoveanu {{and a member of the}} Văcărescu family. His second son was adopted by a more prestigious Oltenian, the Vornic Barbu C. Știrbei, who left him his name, the estate of Cepturoaia, and vineyards outside Drăgășani. The Bibescu and Știrbei branches remained distinct and competitive, with the two brothers even running against each other in the princely election of 1842—although eventually Barbu ceded Gheorghe his votes. Figures of the establishment looked down on both of them, seeing them as upstarts, equally unprepared for national politics.|$|E
2500|$|Hrizea {{took refuge}} in the Ottoman Empire, where he surrendered, and then was {{retained}} with his family as hostage by Transylvanian Prince George II Rákóczi. He escaped his captivity at Feyérvár during the confusion that followed Rákóczi's participation in the Swedish Deluge. Trying to stage his return to Wallachia with a new Seimeni force, he was reportedly kidnapped south of Hermannstadt, and delivered to Wallachia as a prisoner. His supporters were met by Preda Brâncoveanu in <b>Gorj</b> <b>County</b> in September 1657, and were defeated there, possibly following a ruse or a betrayal.|$|E
2500|$|Tzigara's {{fieldwork}} also focused {{specifically on}} increasing the museum's ethnographic collection. Particularly active in Oltenia, he was, as Ioana Popescu notes, [...] "more attracted by decorated, colorful objects, used at celebration time." [...] During one such trip to <b>Gorj</b> <b>County,</b> he bought, disassembled and transported back to Bucharest the [...] "Antonie Mogoș House", considered {{a masterpiece of}} Romanian woodcarving and the museum's centerpiece. It is the first-ever such relocation {{in the history of}} Romanian museums. His photographic collection was expanded by an entire series on Oltenian carpets, which helps in their specific taxonomy.|$|E

2500|$|Bacalbașa was {{a native}} of Brăila, where his father Costache was serving as Police chief. The family traced its origins to <b>Gorj</b> <b>County,</b> {{changing}} their name from Telescu to Bacalbașa (literally, [...] "head of the grocers") when one of them became leader of a guild in Galați. Costache had a military career in autonomous Wallachia, from 1834 to 1841, then settled in Brăila with his wife Aneta; they had thirteen children, seven of whom died before reaching maturity. According to literary historian George Călinescu, the exact date of Anton's birth is a mystery, but, judging by one of Toni's poems, may be February 21, 1865.|$|E
2500|$|Victor-Viorel Ponta ( [...] ; born 20 September 1972) is a Romanian jurist and politician, {{who served}} as Prime Minister of Romania between his {{appointment}} by President Traian Băsescu in May 2012 and his resignation in November 2015. A {{former member of the}} Social Democratic Party (PSD) and its leader from 2010 to 2015, he was also joint leader (2012–2014) of the then-governing Social Liberal Union (USL), an alliance with the National Liberal Party (PNL). Ponta {{has been a member of}} the Romanian Chamber of Deputies for <b>Gorj</b> <b>County</b> since 2004. In the Emil Boc cabinet, he was Minister-Delegate for Relations with Parliament from 2008 to 2009.|$|E
2500|$|The sources {{compiled}} by Iorga suggest that Hrizea {{never managed to}} rekindle the revolt with his presence, being betrayed by a Transylvanian Romanian notable in whose house he was lodging, and then delivered to Wallachia as a prisoner. His cause had remained popular with both the mercenaries and the Wallachian commoners. Some 400 Seimeni had grouped in northern Oltenia, possibly at Bistrița Monastery, where they expected his return. A Wallachian army, led by Brâncoveanu, met them in <b>Gorj</b> <b>County,</b> at Târgul Bengăi or Bengești-Ciocadia. As noted by Iorga, {{they were asked to}} surrender but refused, and were then decimated. Other reports suggest that they were [...] "not defeated", but promised safe haven, and disarmed under this false pretense.|$|E
50|$|Born in Țăndărei, Ialomița County, {{his parents}} were Haralambie Georgiu (Grandea), a {{merchant}} of Aromanian origin, and his wife Maria (née Baldovin). He studied at the national {{school of medicine and}} pharmacy (1855-1859) and, intermittently, at Saint Sava High School in the national capital Bucharest, graduating in 1865. In 1866 and 1867, he took courses at the philosophy and literature faculty of the University of Liège, but did not graduate. He worked as an intern at Colțea Hospital (1860), a surgeon's assistant in Ilfov County (1861), a battalion's medic in Bucharest, a professor of natural sciences at the national school of medicine and pharmacy (1862-1863), secretary of the State Archives' document committee (1864), school inspector for <b>Gorj</b> and Mehedinți <b>counties</b> (1871) and interim professor at Bucharest (1868), Craiova (1874) and Bacău (1888). All these jobs were temporary, and for significant periods of time, he supported himself through journalism, working as an editor at Monitorul Oficial, Dâmbovița, Presa, Timpul and Războiul. A passionate and fairly talented newspaperman, he was chief editor for a number of periodicals, including Albina Pindului (1868-1878), Liceul român (1870), Steaua Daciei (1871), Tribuna (1873), Bucegiu (1879) and Sentinela (1887). He wrote for many of the country's major magazines and newspapers, including Foaie pentru minte, inimă și literatură, Amicul poporului, Familia, Trompeta Carpailor, Românul, Columna lui Traian and Universul literar. His anti-liberal political orientation presaged that of Mihai Eminescu.|$|R
2500|$|Tudor {{was born}} in Vladimiri, <b>Gorj</b> <b>County</b> (in the region of Oltenia) {{in a family of}} landed peasants (mazili); his birth year is usually given as 1780, but this is still debated. At the age of 12, he was sent to Craiova, in service to boyar Ioan Glogoveanu, where he would later learn rhetoric, grammar and the Greek language. He became {{administrator}} of the boyar's estate and, in 1806, was named vătaf (leader of the local militias) at Cloșani. Tudor's experience as a servant made him familiar with customs, habits and objectives of landowners; this insight helped him walk the fine line between conflicting interests of boyars and peasants in the first months of the uprising against the Phanariotes. While leader of a mainly peasant movement, Tudor did his best not to antagonize the elite, punishing any destruction of property.|$|E
2500|$|Upon winning confirmation, Ponta {{pledged to}} reduce the number of {{emergency}} ordinances issued by the government and to assist Parliament in exercising control over the cabinet. Among his activities was to help steer a new civil and penal code through Parliament. Among the more controversial provisions in these codes that Ponta defended (both as minister and as head of the parliamentary committee drafting the legislation) were one presuming that any defensive act done at night at home would be considered legitimate self-defence; and one banning therapeutic abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy, which received sharp criticism from several NGOs. Ponta, nicknamed [...] "Little Titulescu" [...] by Năstase, has been known to criticise both members of his own party, commenting that then-mayor of Sector 5 Marian Vanghelie (known for his gaffes) [...] "is such a philosopher that not even I can understand him"; and of the PD-L, remarking, after the two parties had entered a governing coalition, that his <b>Gorj</b> <b>County</b> parliamentary colleagues are [...] "parrots, liars and dimwits". Together with his PSD colleagues, Ponta resigned from the cabinet on 1 October 2009, in protest at the dismissal of vice prime minister and Interior Minister Dan Nica.|$|E
