60|$|There {{was a girl}} he had met at one {{of these}} studio contrivances--a glorious, impudent, lucid, open-minded girl with <b>hair</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of Culmbacher, and a good-natured way of despising you. She was a New York girl.|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned back}} {{once more and}} pointed with outstretched hand towards the little church. The wind blew her skirts about her,--disturbed for once the trim, uncompromising {{arrangement}} of her <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> <b>color</b> had come into her cheeks at last. Deane wondered why he had never before thought her beautiful! ...|$|E

60|$|Even at {{any time}} {{she would have been}} an enchanting vision to these men, but in the glow of {{exercise}} and sparkle of anger she was bewildering. Her wonderful <b>hair,</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of freshly hewn redwood, had escaped from her hat in her passage through the underbrush, and even as she swept down upon them in her majesty she was jabbing a hairpin into it with a dexterous feminine hand.|$|E
60|$|Two {{little girls}} were {{standing}} in the lane below. The elder, who had spoken in that small, anxious voice, had a pale little face with pointed chin; her <b>hair,</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of over-ripe corn, hung fluffy on her thin shoulders, her flower-like eyes, with something motherly in them already, were the same hue as her pale-blue, almost clean, overall. She had her smaller, chubbier sister by the hand, and, having delivered her message, stood still, gazing up at Tod, as one might at God. Tod dropped his hoe.|$|E
5000|$|Grullo or grulla, {{also called}} blue dun or [...] "mouse" [...] dun, is a smoky, bluish, to mouse-brown color and {{can vary from}} light to dark. They {{consistently}} have black points and they often have a dark or black head, which is an identifying characteristic of this <b>color.</b> <b>The</b> primitive markings usually are all black. Genetically, the horse has an underlying black coat color, acted upon by the dun gene. Unlike a blue roan, there are no intermingled black and white hairs, and unlike a true gray, which also intermingles light and dark <b>hairs,</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> does not change to a lighter shade as the horse ages. With a dun, <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>color</b> itself is one solid shade.|$|R
5000|$|The beetle is no {{more than}} 7 {{millimeters}} long. It is elongated oval in shape and covered in a coat of scaly <b>hairs,</b> especially on <b>the</b> underside. It has large eyes and hairy antennae and legs. Among the collected specimens, females are slightly larger and thicker than males. The coloration is variable; smaller males are coppery in color, larger males are a [...] "brassy green", and females are generally brassy with a green tinge. <b>The</b> <b>color</b> also varies with the distribution of <b>the</b> <b>hairs,</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> changing as <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> wear off. This beetle is most similar to genus Eudiadora.|$|R
50|$|Hair coloring, or <b>hair</b> dyeing, is <b>the</b> {{practice}} of changing <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>color.</b> <b>The</b> {{main reasons for}} this are cosmetic: to cover gray or white hair, to change to a color regarded as more fashionable or desirable, to restore <b>the</b> original <b>hair</b> <b>color</b> {{after it has been}} discolored by hairdressing processes or sun bleaching.|$|R
60|$|He was {{rough-hewn}} indeed, with gray-green eyes, and <b>hair</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> {{of golden}} sand: {{it would not}} stay brushed. It was this hair that hinted most strongly of individualism, that {{was by no means}} orthodox. Langmaid felt an incongruity, but he was fascinated; and he had discovered on the rector's shelves evidences of the taste for classical authors that he himself possessed. Thus fate played with him, and the two men ranged from Euripides to Horace, from Horace to Dante and Gibbon. And when Hodder got up to fetch this or that edition, he seemed to tower over the lawyer, who was a big man himself.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Emma had {{the soul}} of a six-foot dowager duchess, and should have had an eagle nose and a white pompadour. Actually, she was of medium height, with a not unduly {{maternal}} bosom, a broad, commonplace face, <b>hair</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of faded grass, a blunt nose with slightly enlarged pores, and thin lips that seemed to be a straight line when seen from in front, but, seen in profile, puffed out like a fish's. She had a habit of nodding intelligently even when she was not listening, and another habit of rubbing her left knuckles with the fingers of her right hand. Not imposing in appearance was Aunt Emma Truegate Winslow, but she was born to discipline a court.|$|E
60|$|The {{light from}} a half-opened shutter fell full upon her rebellious little figure. She had {{stiffened}} herself in a large easy-chair into the attitude {{in which she had}} been evidently deposited there by the nurse whose torn-off apron she still held rigidly in one hand. Her shapely legs stood out before her, jointless and inflexible to the point of her tiny shoes--a POSE copied with pathetic fidelity by the French doll at her feet. The attitude must have been dreadfully uncomfortable, and maintained only as being replete with some vague insults to the person who had put her down, as exhibiting a wild indecorum of silken stocking. A mystified kitten--Sarah Walker's inseparable--was held as rigidly under one arm with equal dumb aggressiveness. Following the stiff line of her half-recumbent figure, her head suddenly appeared perpendicularly erect--yet the only mobile part of her body. A dazzling sunburst of silky <b>hair,</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of burnished copper, partly hid her neck and shoulders and the back of the chair. Her eyes were a darker shade of the same color--the orbits appearing deeper and larger from the rubbing in of habitual tears from long wet lashes. Nothing so far seemed inconsistent with her infelix reputation, but, strange to say, her other features were marked by delicacy and refinement, and her mouth--that sorely exercised and justly dreaded member--was small and pretty, albeit slightly dropped at the corners.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{painters}} have {{exhibited a}} fascination with red <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> <b>color</b> [...] "Titian" [...] {{takes its name from}} the artist Titian, who often painted women with red hair. Early Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli's famous painting The Birth of Venus depicts the mythological goddess Venus as a redhead. Other painters notable for their redheads include the Pre-Raphaelites, Edmund Leighton, Modigliani, and Gustav Klimt.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>hair</b> {{of workers}} who {{regularly}} come into close contact with cobalt or indigo may become blue because of the dust of the substance mixing into <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicle. <b>The</b> <b>color</b> in these cases is [...] "not merely superficial", but an actual coloration of <b>the</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|R

50|$|The term Titian is {{sometimes}} misapplied to auburn hair. While Titian hair is a brownish shade of red hair, auburn hair is a brownish shade of <b>hair</b> encompassing <b>the</b> actual <b>color</b> red. Most definitions of Titian hair {{describe it as}} a brownish-orange color, but some describe it as being reddish. This is in reference to red <b>hair</b> itself, not <b>the</b> <b>color</b> red.|$|R

5000|$|Alphito (Ἀλφιτώ) is {{a supernatural}} being first {{recorded}} in the Moralia of Plutarch, where [...] "apotropaic nursery tales" [...] about her are told by nursemaids to frighten little children into behaving. Her name is related to alphita, [...] "white flour" [...] (compare Latin albus), and alphitomanteia, a form of divination (-manteia) from flour or barley meal. She was presumably old, with white <b>hair</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of flour.|$|E
50|$|The {{hair color}} of mummies or buried bodies can change. Hair {{contains}} {{a mixture of}} black-brown-yellow eumelanin and red pheomelanin. Eumelanin is less chemically stable than pheomelanin and breaks down faster when oxidized. It {{is for this reason}} that Egyptian mummies have reddish <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> <b>color</b> of hair changes faster under extreme conditions. It changes more slowly under dry oxidizing conditions (such as in burials in sand or in ice) than under wet reducing conditions (such as burials in wood or plaster coffins).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} hair coloration which is different from any currently available system. It is based on formation within <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> of deposits of a melanin pigment, very similar in character to that responsible for <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of natural <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> <b>coloring</b> process consists of two steps: a shampoo during which a dye initiator (Cu II) is introduced into <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> structure and, following a rinse, treatment with an aqueous olution of a colorless melanin precursor, 5, 6 -dihydroxindole. <b>The</b> <b>coloring</b> process is usually complete within five to ten minutes. The melanin deposits are formed in the peripheral regions of hair and thus are readily available for color modification or even total removal...|$|R

He is less than thrilled when his father tells him that he will be spending Christmas with his mother, Merle. While Joe can behave in a very juvenile fashion, he continued to mock Twiggy's teas that she prepared for trading in the Midnight Market, he is also a very caring young man as he demonstrates when he assists the betterment of the magical community over searching for his father, and when he spares the last bit of thawing potion for the dying Dunkel.|$|E
50|$|Hearing this, many urged Fedlimid to {{kill the}} baby at birth, but Conchobar, aroused by the {{description}} of her future beauty, decided to keep the child for himself. He took Deirdre away from her family and had her brought up in seclusion by Leabharcham, a poet and wise woman, and planned to marry Deirdre when she was old enough. As a young girl, living isolated in the woodlands, Deirdre one snowy day told Leabharcham that she would love a man with the colours she had seen when a raven landed in the snow with its prey: <b>hair</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of the raven, skin as white as snow, and cheeks as red as blood.|$|E
