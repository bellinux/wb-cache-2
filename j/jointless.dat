5|$|The {{belief that}} certain animals cannot rise if pushed over has {{historical}} antecedents, though cattle {{have never been}} so classified. Julius Caesar recorded a belief that a European elk (moose) had no knee joints and could not get up if it fell. Pliny said the same about the hind legs of an animal he called the achlis, which Pliny's 19th-century translators Bostock and Riley said was merely {{another name for the}} elk. They also noted that Pliny's belief about the <b>jointless</b> back legs of the achlis (elk) was false.|$|E

60|$|But {{the hardships}} had told their tale. Although {{but the same}} age as Malcolm Anderson, Colonel Leslie looked fully ten years older. His long {{confinement}} had taken every tinge of colour out of his face, and left it almost ghastly in its whiteness. He could with difficulty lift his hands to his head, and he walked as stiffly as if his legs had been <b>jointless.</b> His voice only had not lost the cheery ring his wife remembered.|$|E
60|$|This {{was partly}} due to the {{peculiar}} method of instruction in vogue at Mme Gavarni's, and partly to the fact that, {{when it came to the}} actual lessons, a sudden niece was produced from a back room to give them. She was a blonde young lady with laughing blue eyes, and Henry never clasped her trim waist without feeling a black-hearted traitor to his absent Minnie. Conscience racked him. Add to this the sensation of being a strange, <b>jointless</b> creature with abnormally large hands and feet, and the fact that it was Mme Gavarni's custom to stand in a corner of the room during the hour of tuition, chewing gum and making comments, and it is not surprising that Henry became wan and thin.|$|E
60|$|Then it {{came upon}} me, with no horror, but a certain mild wonder, {{that we had}} waited, Vee and I, that night for the body of Boy Bayley; and that Vee himself had died of typhoid {{in the spring of}} 1902. The {{rustling}} of the papers continued, but Bayley, shifting slightly, revealed to me the three- day old wound on his left side that had soaked the ground about him. I saw Pigeon fling up a helpless arm as to guard himself against a spatter of shrapnel, and Luttrell with a foolish tight-lipped smile lurched over all in one <b>jointless</b> piece. Only old Vee's honest face held steady for awhile against the darkness that had swallowed up the battalion behind us. Then his jaw dropped and the face stiffened, so that a fly made bold to explore the puffed and scornful nostril.|$|E

60|$|The {{first time}} I {{went over to}} see Mr. Harmer, I was quite shocked at the change which had taken place since I had last seen him, {{little more than two}} months before. He rose to meet me when I went into the library where he was sitting, with quite his old smile of welcome, and I did not so much notice the change till he was fairly on his feet. Then indeed I saw how great it was. His old free, erect bearing was gone, and he stood upright with difficulty, and when he tried to walk, it was in a stiff and <b>jointless</b> sort of way, very painful to see. But the {{greatest}} alteration was in his voice; formerly he spoke in such a frank, hearty, joyous way, and now each word seemed to come out slowly and with difficulty. Although papa had warned me that I should see a great change in him, I had no idea of such a terrible alteration as this, and it was so great a shock to me, that I could not help breaking down and crying.|$|E
60|$|The {{light from}} a half-opened shutter fell full upon her rebellious little figure. She had {{stiffened}} herself in a large easy-chair into the attitude {{in which she had}} been evidently deposited there by the nurse whose torn-off apron she still held rigidly in one hand. Her shapely legs stood out before her, <b>jointless</b> and inflexible to the point of her tiny shoes--a POSE copied with pathetic fidelity by the French doll at her feet. The attitude must have been dreadfully uncomfortable, and maintained only as being replete with some vague insults to the person who had put her down, as exhibiting a wild indecorum of silken stocking. A mystified kitten--Sarah Walker's inseparable--was held as rigidly under one arm with equal dumb aggressiveness. Following the stiff line of her half-recumbent figure, her head suddenly appeared perpendicularly erect--yet the only mobile part of her body. A dazzling sunburst of silky hair, the color of burnished copper, partly hid her neck and shoulders and the back of the chair. Her eyes were a darker shade of the same color--the orbits appearing deeper and larger from the rubbing in of habitual tears from long wet lashes. Nothing so far seemed inconsistent with her infelix reputation, but, strange to say, her other features were marked by delicacy and refinement, and her mouth--that sorely exercised and justly dreaded member--was small and pretty, albeit slightly dropped at the corners.|$|E
60|$|My appetite, I need hardly say, had {{not been}} {{improved}} by the incidents which had occurred during the day. I sat down, however, mechanically at the table, {{and listened to the}} talk which was going on around me. There were nearly a hundred first-class passengers, and as the wine began to circulate, their voices combined with the clash of the dishes to form a perfect Babel. I found myself seated between a very stout and nervous old lady and a prim little clergyman; and as neither made any advances I retired into my shell, and spent my time in observing the appearance of my fellow-voyagers. I could see Dick in the dim distance dividing his attentions between a <b>jointless</b> fowl {{in front of him and}} a self-possessed young lady at his side. Captain Dowie was doing the honours at my end, while the surgeon of the vessel was seated at the other. I was glad to notice that Flannigan was placed almost opposite to me. As long as I had him before my eyes I knew that, for the time at least, we were safe. He was sitting with what was meant to be a sociable smile on his grim face. It did not escape me that he drank largely of wine--so largely that even before the dessert appeared his voice had become decidedly husky. His friend Muller was seated a few places lower down. He ate little, and appeared to be nervous and restless.|$|E
6000|$|We {{got to the}} {{bulkhead}} at last. Those were stout planks. She was a ship, well finished in every detail--the Narcissus was. They were the stoutest planks ever put into a ship's bulkhead--we thought--and then we perceived that, in our hurry, we had sent all the tools overboard. Absurd little Belfast wanted to break it down with his own weight, and with both feet leaped straight up like a springbok, cursing the Clyde shipwrights for not scamping their work. Incidentally he reviled all North Britain, {{the rest of the}} earth, the sea--and all his companions. He swore, as he alighted heavily on his heels, that he would never, never any more associate with any fool that [...] "hadn't savee enough to know his knee from his elbow." [...] He managed by his thumping to scare the last remnant of wits out of Jimmy. We could hear the object of our exasperated solicitude darting to and fro under the planks. He had cracked his voice at last, and could only squeak miserably. His back or else his head rubbed the planks, now here, now there, in a puzzling manner. He squeaked as he dodged the invisible blows. It was more heartrending even than his yells. Suddenly Archie produced a crowbar. He had kept it back; also a small hatchet. We howled with satisfaction. He struck a mighty blow and small chips flew at our eyes. The boatswain above shouted:--"Look out! Look out there. Don't kill the man. Easy does it!" [...] Wamibo, maddened with excitement, hung head down and insanely urged us:--"Hoo! Strook'im! Hoo! Hoo!" [...] We were afraid he would fall in and kill one of us and, hurriedly, we entreated the boatswain to [...] "shove the blamed Finn overboard." [...] Then, all together, we yelled down at the planks:--"Stand from under! Get forward," [...] and listened. We only heard the deep hum and moan of the wind above us, the mingled roar and hiss of the seas. The ship, as if overcome with despair, wallowed lifelessly, and our heads swam with that unnatural motion. Belfast clamoured:--"For the love of God, Jimmy, where are ye?... Knock! Jimmy darlint!... Knock! You bloody black beast! Knock!" [...] He was as quiet as a dead man inside a grave; and, like men standing above a grave, we {{were on the verge of}} tears--but with vexation, the strain, the fatigue; with the great longing to be done with it, to get away, and lie down to rest somewhere where we could see our danger and breathe. Archie shouted:--"Gi'e me room!" [...] We crouched behind him, guarding our heads, and he struck time after time in the joint of planks. They cracked. Suddenly the crowbar went halfway in through a splintered oblong hole. It must have missed Jimmy's head by less than an inch. Archie withdrew it quickly, and that infamous nigger rushed at the hole, put his lips to it, and whispered [...] "Help" [...] in an almost extinct voice; he pressed his head to it, trying madly to get out through that opening one inch wide and three inches long. In our disturbed state we were absolutely paralysed by his incredible action. It seemed impossible to drive him away. Even Archie at last lost his composure. [...] "If ye don't clear oot I'll drive the crowbar thro' your head," [...] he shouted in a determined voice. He meant what he said, and his earnestness seemed to make an impression on Jimmy. He disappeared suddenly, and we set to prising and tearing at the planks with the eagerness of men trying to get at a mortal enemy, and spurred by the desire to tear him limb from limb. The wood split, cracked, gave way. Belfast plunged in head and shoulders and groped viciously. [...] "I've got 'im! Got 'im," [...] he shouted. [...] "Oh! There!... He's gone; I've got 'im!... Pull at my legs!... Pull!" [...] Wamibo hooted unceasingly. The boatswain shouted directions:--"Catch hold of his hair, Belfast; pull straight up, you two!... Pull fair!" [...] We pulled fair. We pulled Belfast out with a jerk, and dropped him with disgust. In a sitting posture, purple-faced, he sobbed despairingly:--"How can I hold on to 'is blooming short wool?" [...] Suddenly Jimmy's head and shoulders appeared. He stuck halfway, and with rolling eyes foamed at our feet. We flew at him with brutal impatience, we tore the shirt off his back, we tugged at his ears, we panted over him; and all at once he came away in our hands as though somebody had let go his legs. With the same movement, without a pause, we swung him up. His breath whistled, he kicked our upturned faces, he grasped two pairs of arms above his head, and he squirmed up with such precipitation that he seemed positively to escape from our hands like a bladder full of gas. Streaming with perspiration, we swarmed up the rope, and, coming into the blast of cold wind, gasped like men plunged into icy water. With burning faces we shivered to the very marrow of our bones. Never before had the gale seemed to us more furious, the sea more mad, the sunshine more merciless and mocking, and the position of the ship more hopeless and appalling. Every movement of her was ominous of the end of her agony and of the beginning of ours. We staggered away from the door, and, alarmed by a sudden roll, fell down in a bunch. It appeared to us that the side of the house was more smooth than glass and more slippery than ice. There was nothing to hang on to but a long brass hook used sometimes to keep back an open door. Wamibo held on to it and we held on to Wamibo, clutching our Jimmy. He had completely collapsed now. He did not seem to have the strength to close his hand. We stuck to him blindly in our fear. We were not afraid of Wamibo letting go (we remembered that the brute was stronger than any three men in the ship), but we were afraid of the hook giving way, and we also believed that the ship had made up her mind to turn over at last. But she didn't. A sea swept over us. The boatswain spluttered:--"Up and away. There's a lull. Away aft with you, or we will all go to the devil here." [...] We stood up surrounding Jimmy. We begged him to hold up, to hold on, at least. He glared with his bulging eyes, mute as a fish, and with all the stiffening knocked out of him. He wouldn't stand; he wouldn't even as much as clutch at our necks; he was only a cold black skin loosely stuffed with soft cotton wool; his arms and legs swung <b>jointless</b> and pliable; his head rolled about; the lower lip hung down, enormous and heavy. We pressed round him, bothered and dismayed; sheltering him we swung here and there in a body; and on the very brink of eternity we tottered all together with concealing and absurd gestures, like a lot of drunken men embarrassed with a stolen corpse.|$|E

The performers traditionally belong to the Bhat community and the singing is accompanied by musical instruments including ramtali (castanets), kabuji (cymbals) and the khanjani, a kind of tambourine. The dialogues and the songs in the performance are accompanied by lively, rhythmic music that combines elements of folk and classical music. Performances have little by way of dance or fight sequences, the action being limited by the <b>jointless</b> nature of the puppets, but the dramatic effect is elevated by the use of poetic language, music and the religious themes narrated.

5000|$|A resin-saturated felt tube made of polyester, {{fibreglass}} cloth or {{a number}} of other materials suitable for resin impregnation, is inverted or pulled into a damaged pipe. It is usually done from the upstream access point (manhole or excavation). It is possible to invert the liner upstream (e.g. from the downstream access point) but this carries greater risk. It is possible to install a liner from the downstream access point, upstream to a blind end however this carries the highest risk of all the CIPP installation methods. Little to no digging is involved in this trenchless process, making for a potentially more cost-effective and less disruptive method than traditional [...] "dig and replace" [...] pipe repair methods. The liner can be inverted using water or air pressure. The pressure required for inversion can be generated using pressure vessels, scaffolds or a [...] "Chip unit". Hot water, UV light, ambient cured or steam is used to cure the resin and form a tight-fitting, <b>jointless</b> and corrosion-resistant replacement pipe. Service laterals are restored internally with robotically controlled cutting devices in the larger diameter pipe. Smaller diameters (100mm) can be opened remotely however they are often reinstated by excavation. The service lateral connection can be sealed with specially designed CIPP materials. The resin used is typically polyester for mainline lining and epoxy for lateral lines. Since all resins shrink (epoxy resins shrink far less than poly and vinyl ester versions) and it is impossible to bond to a sewer that has fats, oils, and grease an annular space exists between the new CIPP liner and the host pipe. The annular space exists in all installations just some are larger than others and depending on the severity may need additional rehabiliation. There are multiple ways to prevent water from tracking in the annular space and entering back into the waste stream including: water swelling material (hydrophilic), lining of the entire connection and host pipe with a continuous repair (YT repari) gaskets, and point repairs placed at the ends of the host pipe and at the lateral connections. The rehabilitated pipe is then inspected by closed-circuit television (CCTV). CIPP is considered a trenchless technology.|$|E

Please click on the alternative location to access it. 129 p. <b>JOINTLESS</b> is a MADS-box gene that {{plays a key role in}} tomato flower pedicel abscission zone development. In <b>jointless</b> mutant plants, some inflorescence meristems revert to vegetative growth, their flowering time is slightly delayed, and the sympodial identity of inflorescence meristems is suppressed. However, we still don't know why the lack of the normal <b>JOINTLESS</b> protein has the pleiotropic effects in the mutant's development. Here I report more evidence that <b>JOINTLESS</b> gene is a pleiotropic regulator of tomato growth and development, and it may affect multiple hormone homeostasis in tomato. Compared to wild type plants, <b>jointless</b> mutant plants have larger and heavier seeds and fruits; delayed germination; thicker, longer hypocotyls, stems and hypocotyls cells; and more and longer internodes. Mature <b>jointless</b> plants are also much taller, they have fewer seeds per fruit, and about 30 % of the <b>jointless</b> fruits have developed irregular fruit locule structure. These phenotypes are similar to some plant hormone mutants. To determine whether <b>JOINTLESS</b> affects the perception and/or production of plant hormones, dose response experiments were performed on six major plant hormones and some of their inhibitors. The results show that <b>jointless</b> seedlings are more sensitive not only to the external hormones auxin (IAA), ethylene (ACC), gibberellin (GA 3), and brassinosteroids (24 -eBL), but also to the gibberellin synthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol (PAC) and auxin transport inhibitor N- 1 -Naphthylphthalamic Acid (NPA). Real-time PCR results show that some key genes involved in ethylene and gibberellin synthesis, auxin signaling and metabolism, and cell wall metabolism are upregulated in the <b>jointless</b> mutant seedlings. I propose that <b>JOINTLESS</b> is involved in regulating the perception and/or production of multiple plant hormones and/or the crosstalk between them, leading to its pleiotropic effects on tomato growth and development in the mutant plants. A model is proposed to explain how <b>JOINTLESS</b> affects the development of tomato flower pedicel abscission zones. This research not only deepens our understanding of the functional mechanism of <b>JOINTLESS,</b> but also furthers our understanding of plant MADS-box genes' functional mechanism in general. At the same time, because <b>JOINTLESS</b> is involved in regulating traits that are important in agriculture such as fruit abscission zone, fruit size, seed size, and plant height, we may be able manipulate these traits genetically by changing the expression levels of <b>JOINTLESS...</b>|$|E

Typically these bridges have stub-type abutments supported on piles and continuous bridge deck from one embankment to the other.

Integrally bridges are simple or multiple span ones that have their superstructure cast integrally with their substructure. The <b>jointless</b> bridges cost less to construct and require less maintenance then equivalent bridges with expansion joints. Integral bridges present a challenge for load distribution calculations because the bridge deck, piers, abutments, embankments and soil must all be considered as single compliant system.
