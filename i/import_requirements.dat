Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger was highly negative, writing on his copy of McFarlane's paper: [...] "This is almost too absurd to comment on...like asking Qaddafi to Washington for a cozy chat." [...] Secretary of State George Shultz was also opposed, stating that having designated Iran a State Sponsor of Terrorism in January 1984, how could the United States possibly sell arms to Iran? Only the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency William Casey supported McFarlane's plan to start selling arms to Iran.|$|E

The paper outlines key assumptions about future changes in grain policies and other important explanatory variables in the models. On the supply side, projections are made for grain sown area, grain yield and total grain output. Future grain demand is disaggregated into four categories, human food, animal feed, industrial uses and seed grain, each incorporating high, medium and low demand growth scenarios. A grain balance sheet is constructed for 2010 which shows a 'most probable' <b>import</b> <b>requirement</b> of about 32 million tones—a 10 million tones increase over the actual 1995 level.

30|$|This {{special issue}} {{published}} 11 papers related to different {{problems in the}} field of land reclamation. The first and second papers are related to legislation of land reclamation. Reclamation regulation in the USA was enacted in 1977, which is well-known law for land reclamation. The first one presented some of the basic changes made in reclamation programs over the last 40  years in the State of Wyoming, USA based on the federal regulation entitled “Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA)”. Mining permit is very <b>import</b> <b>requirement</b> in this regulation. Approximately 40 % of USA coal originates in an ecologically sensitive area of semi-arid shortgrass prairie in Wyoming. The second paper introduced the practice and experience of surface coal mine permit application for successful reclamation in Wyoming. The permit application includes adjudication information, baseline information, mine and operation plans, and reclamation plans. Fulfillment of permit commitments and requirements of rules and regulations are inspected monthly by the LQD’s representative in the field. Before a mine permit is issued, the mine operator must submit a reclamation bond to secure the performance of reclamation obligations that is later revised annually. The Bond Release Geodatabase (a GIS/GPS approach) was developed for this mine to monitor progress in meeting criteria and performance standards for incremental bond release.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} a dynamic multisector {{equilibrium}} {{model can be}} formulated {{to be able to}} analyze the optimal borrowing policy of a developing country. It also describes how a non-linear programming model with the proposed features was constructed for Brazil, and discusses the optimal solution of a base case scenario for the economy in the next 20 years. The sensitivity analysis emphasizes the response of the model to different interest rates on foreign borrowing, alternative export expansion and <b>imports</b> <b>requirements</b> scenarios, and different hypothesis with respect to future petroleum prices and domestic petroleum production. The main conclusion is that the optimal long run borrowing policy for Brazil is quite sensitive to the expected future interest rates, and may be different from some myopic strategies which are currently being suggested to handle the developing countries' foreign debt problems. The other important conclusion is that in the less favorable scenarios - protectionist foreign environment or higher petroleum prices - it is not optimal to postpone the required domestic adjustments by increased foreign borrowing. The usefulness of the model is not restricted to this set of simulations, since it can be readily adapted to address related issues such as foreign trade, investment and indirect taxation policie...|$|R
