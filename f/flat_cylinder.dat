25|$|The Montenegrin cap is a {{traditional}} hat for ethnic Serbs in Montenegro and in later times the self identifying Montenegrins, originally {{in the shape of}} a <b>flat</b> <b>cylinder,</b> having a red upper surface (called tepeluk) not dissimilar to the Herzegovina and Lika caps. It was wholly red until Prince-Bishop Petar II Petrović Njegoš surrounded it with a black rim (called derevija), and the definition given was as a sign of grief of occupied Kosovo. The Kosovo Myth was very popular in the Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro. The enforcement of the cap upon the Montenegrin chieftains by Peter II was a mark of expression of then's dominating Serbian national identity. The national telling recorded the most often version of the cap as following: the black wrapper was sign of grief for the once big Empire, the red the bloody defeat at the Battle of Kosovo and the five small stripes on the top represent the remaining remains of the once greater Serbian realm, which became increasingly popular amongst the common folk during the reign of Prince Danilo I Petrović-Njegoš. Within the stripes is angled a six star, representing the last free part, Montenegro, shining upon the fallen and conquered. Worn by the rulers and chieftains, the version with the Four Ocil symbol in the star's place had become across the years with growth of nationalism excessively popular amongst the ordinary people, the symbol of the Serbian Orthodox Church, which effectively worked on maintaining and raising the national identity.|$|E

40|$|The T-matrix method, {{which is}} also known as the null field method (NFM) or {{extended}} boundary condition method (EBCM), has established itself as a well known and highly regarded method for calculating light scattering by non-spherical particles. Its biggest advantage is the possibility to obtain all information about the scattering characteristics of the particle and to store it into one matrix. This enables one to do additional investigations with low efforts. Unfortunately the standard NFM fails to converge for particles with extremely non-spherical particle shapes, like long <b>cylinders</b> or coin-like <b>flat</b> <b>cylinders.</b> In this paper we investigate light scattering by finite particles {{in the form of an}} oblate disc sphere, which can be described as <b>flat</b> <b>cylinders</b> with a rounded edge. We use an advanced form of the T-matrix method - the null field method with discrete sources (NFM-DS). By presenting light scattering results we would like to demonstrate the potential this advanced NFM-DS offers. It allows one to calculate particle shapes with aspect ratios (relation between radius and thickness of the particle) up to 100 : 1 and size parameters (relation between radius and wavelength) up to 30...|$|R

This causes turbulence, which is desirable because it promotes more extensive mixing of the fuel/air mixture: cf: cf1, cf2, cf3).|$|E

Its very unusual design featured a <b>flat</b> <b>cylinder</b> with two chambers, {{in which the}} bottom chamber was loaded from a sideways-inserted magazine that also functioned as the left grip plate. During firing, the revolver's reciprocating bolt would extract and eject the round from the top chamber after firing, load a round into the bottom chamber, and then rotate the cylinder. The revolver would then be ready to fire again. It was chambered for the 7.5mm Nagant cartridge, {{which at the time}} was also used in both the Norwegian and Swedish versions of the Belgian Nagant M1895 revolver.|$|E

40|$|A recent {{variation}} of the classical geodetic problem, the strong geodetic problem, is defined as follows. If G is a graph, then sg(G) is the cardinality of a smallest vertex subset S, such that one can assign a fixed geodesic to each pair {x,y}⊆ S so that these |S| 2 geodesics cover all the vertices of G. In this paper, the strong geodesic problem is studied on Cartesian product graphs.

5000|$|By 1912 Anzani {{had built}} the world's first two row radial engine, the 10 {{cylinder}} Anzani 10, which came in two sizes, the bigger 12.1 litre one producing 100-110 hp. By the middle of 1913 the company had a double version with four rows of five cylinders, rated at 200 hp called the Anzani 20. [...] This was displayed at the Paris show of that year and had {{much in common with}} the ten cylinder engine. An air-cooled motor, its cylinders were made of cast iron, with integral cooling fins. [...] The pistons and their rings were also cast iron, machined inside and out. Conical seats for the inlet and exhaust valves were ground into the <b>flat</b> <b>cylinder</b> head, the nickel steel valves being of the poppet type. The automatic, atmospheric pressure operated inlet vales of the earliest Anzani engines were retained, but, as in other later Anzanis the exhaust valves were push-rod and rocker operated.|$|E
5000|$|The basic SWC design {{consists}} of a roughly conical nose, truncated with a flat point (called a meplat), sitting on a cylinder (A at right). The base of the cone is slightly smaller in diameter than the cylinder, leaving a sharp shoulder. The flat nose punches a clean hole in the target, rather than tearing it like a round nose bullet would, and the sharp shoulder enlarges the hole neatly, allowing easy and accurate scoring of the target. The SWC design offers better external ballistics than the wadcutter, as its conical nose produces less drag than the <b>flat</b> <b>cylinder.</b> A typical modification is to alter the conical section to make the sides concave, to reduce the bullet mass, or convex, to increase it. B shows a concave sided SWC, typical of a lightweight [...]45 ACP bullet used in [...] bullseye shooting. The concave sides reduce the bullet weight, and thus the recoil, while keeping the overall length of the bullet long enough to feed reliably in a semi-automatic pistol such as the M1911 commonly found in bullseye competitions.|$|E
