25|$|Black-level {{clamping}} (422914, filed 11 July 1933 by Blumlein, Browne and Hardwick). This is {{an improved}} form of DC restoration, {{compared to the}} simple <b>DC</b> <b>restorer</b> (consisting of a capacitor, diode and resistor) which had been patented by Peter Willans three months earlier.|$|E
50|$|Clamping {{circuits}} {{were common}} in analog television receivers. These sets have a <b>DC</b> <b>restorer</b> circuit, which returns the voltage {{of the video}} signal during the 'back porch' of the line blanking (retrace) period to 0 V. Low frequency interference, especially power line hum, induced onto the signal spoils the rendering of the image, and in extreme cases causes the set to lose synchronization. This interference can be effectively removed via this method.|$|E

This {{was done by}} passing the data through a 400 Hz to 500 kHz Bessel bandpass filter and linearly adding noise. The power spectral density of the noise was shaped to match the noise out of an analog magnetic tape recorder running at 30 inches per second (in. /s). This provided a simulation of an optimum wideband 2. 0 MHz tape recorder running at 30 in. /s (no flutter, tape dropouts, etc.). The bit rate, pattern, and code to be tested were then selected. The SNR was varied until the bit error probability was approximately 10 ⁻⁶ With a commercial Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) bit synchronizer with a "good" <b>dc</b> <b>restorer</b> and a pseudo-random pattern at 1. 0 megabits per second (Mb/s) (33. 3 kilobits per inch (kb/in.) equivalent packing density), NRZ-L had a 4 dB SNR advantage over DM and a 14 dB advantage over BIΦ/-L for a BEP of 10 ⁻⁶ through the bandpass channel. At 1. 5 Mb/s, NRZL had a 6 dB advantage over DM and a 10 ⁻⁶ BEP was not achievable with BIΦ/-L coding. For a synchronizer with no dc restoration NRZ-L had only a 1 dB advantage over DM at 1. 0 Mb/s and also only a 1 dB advantage at 1. 5 Mb/s. M² gave the same results as DM for pseudo-random data. However, M² was relatively insensitive to patterns while DM and NRZ-L required a higher SNR with a "good" <b>dc</b> <b>restorer</b> and lost synchronization completely with no <b>dc</b> <b>restorer</b> for worst case 16 -bit repeating patterns...|$|E
50|$|A {{clamping}} circuit (also {{known as a}} clamper) will bind the upper or lower extreme of a waveform to a fixed DC voltage level. These circuits are also known as <b>DC</b> voltage <b>restorers.</b> Clampers can be constructed in {{both positive and negative}} polarities. When unbiased, {{clamping circuit}}s will fix the voltage lower limit (or upper limit, in the case of negative clampers) to 0 Volts.These circuits clamp a peak of a waveform to a specific DC level compared with a capacitively coupled signal which swings about its average DC level.|$|R
