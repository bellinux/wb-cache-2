40|$|The Government of Pakistan, {{like many}} other {{developing}} countries, has opted for tax holidays as an important fiscal measure to encourage rapid industrialisation in the backward areas. This concession is also supplemented by several other economic and non-economic measures including import duty, and <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances.</b> Mintz (1990) discusses the efficacy of tax holidays {{in the presence of}} accelerated <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> concludes that tax holidays which are designed to increase capital formation may end up penalising capital formation. Mintz’s (1990) conclusion {{is based on the assumption}} that if the assets are long-lived, and the income tax system allows deductibility of accelerated depreciation but cannot be deferred, then the tax holidays, by preventing depreciation deduction in the early period may actually penalise investment during the tax holiday period. If on the other hand the <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance</b> is deferred till the end of tax holiday period, the tax system is genuinely generous and provides a real incentive for capital formation. In Pakistan the tax code are such that the firms in the tax holidays region are not allowed to claim or defer accelerated <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance</b> but can claim normal <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance</b> only after the expiry of tax holidays period. Whereas the firms in developed areas can claim both accelerated (25 percent) and normal <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> (10 percent) annually. Import duty concession is given for most of the underdeveloped areas and few of the developed areas. These different sets of incentives affects the cost of capital and hence investment differently. The purpose of the present paper is to see these effects by computing the cost of capital for developed and under developed areas. This will help us to examine whether the tax holidays as an incentive is effective or act as a barrier to claim other generous concession like the <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{analyzed}} whether capital <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> are good instruments for redistribution {{in the long}} run. In a simple two-class economy it is shown that {{in the short run}} and absent optimizing behaviour accelerated depreciation is good for growth and may stabilize investment in a recession but is generally bad for redistribution. The opposite holds for capital income taxes. However, when the private sector and the government act optimally the optimal <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance</b> is maximal in the long run. This removes the accumulation distortion of capital income taxes. Furthermore, redistribution may be nonzero, depending i. a. on the social weight of those who receive redistributive transfers, the distribution of pre-tax factor incomes, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution and the rate of time preference. It is argued that accelerated <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances,</b> extensively used in the recent economic crisis, are an important indirect tool for redistribution.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to show that the scheme of {{investment}} allowances outlined below would be preferable to the present system of special <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> as a means of encouraging investment by primary producers, especially investment by low-income farmers. The need for increased primary production for balance of payments reasons is assumed and increased investment is the major means of bringing this about. (1) The main determinant of the ability of farmers to invest is the excess of their disposable incomes over the costs of maintaining a required standard of life. (2) The effectiveness of the above schemes depends largely upon the extent to which they increase these surpluses. The empirical studies to date suggest that special <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> have not been very effective in encouraging investment in primary production, especially by low-income farmers. (3) Furthermore, it appears that low-income farmers are not always aware of the existence of special <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances.</b> (4) Their effectiveness is even further reduced by this ignorance. The article is in four sections. Section 1 contains a description of special <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> and of the proposed scheme of investment allowances.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the question of}} how the rules for calculating the investment tax credit and the associated rules for calculating <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> for tax purposes should be structured to assure the "appropriate" relationship between the subsidy granted to long-lived assets and that to short-lived assets. The increasing rate of tax subsidy under the investment credit favors long-lived assets by comparison with a flat-rate credit, while the neglect of the credit in calculating <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> favors short-lived assets (for which the <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance</b> is a more important element in the cash flow). In reviewing the literature on this issue, Emil Sunley focused {{on the question of whether}} the investment credit should vary with the durability of the asset purchased. He concluded that neutrality requires a subsidy rate increasing with the useful life of the asset in a way qualitatively similar to that prescribed in present U. S. law.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The issues {{featured}} {{in this study are}} the vulnerability to inflation of several depreciation methods allowed by the Internal Revenue Service (straight-line, sum-of-the years and declining balance), possible consequences when <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> are based on historical cost and are not updated to price level changes, two proposals under national consideration (First Year Capital Recovery System and Capital Cost Recovery Act) to modify the way in which <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> are calculated, and several suggested procedures to compensate for the loss of purchasing power in depreciation. It is concluded that under inflation and when <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> are expressed in present dollars, additional taxation occurs and the original rate of return of the project decreases. To mitigate these circumstances, adjustments are needed. The magnitude of adjustments is evaluated for each of the main existing depreciation methods. It is shown that straight line method is itself an inflationary force. Numerical examples are presented. Two current proposals to modify the way in which <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> are calculated are described. Under Capital Cost Recovery Act and First Year Capital Recovery System, the risk of purchasing power loss because of inflation is reduced, and the mechanics are simple. However, depreciation is still based on historical cost. As a consequence, capital recovery is not adequate, although, it is superior to the recovery provided for existing methods. It is shown that several procedures can provide for adjustments in depreciation charges according to price level changes and better recover funds invested in capital assets. However, uncertainty of future inflation rates, loss of tax revenue for the government and sometimes complicated mechanics are the primary disadvantages...|$|R

40|$|How do tax {{incentives}} affect firms' investment? Using confidential UK corporation tax returns, we provide new {{evidence on the}} effects of incentives in the form of <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances.</b> We exploit a 2004 exogenous change in the qualifying thresholds for the first-year <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> (FYAs) and conduct a difference-in-difference analysis. Results suggest that the investment rate increased between 2. 1 and 2. 6 percentage points when firms became qualified for FYAs, relative to firms that never qualified. This implies an increase in investment rate of 11 per cent at the mean. We exploit exogenous variation in the timing of tax payments to show that this large effect is not due to an increase in available cash and hence, this is primarily a cost of capital effect. Firms respond rather quickly to FYAs, within 12 to 18 months. Firms also bunch just below notches in the cost of capital created by the qualifying thresholds, suggesting salience of the FYAs.

On the other hand, eliminating the <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance</b> for rental income would be the least effective.

30|$|In {{the field}} of mergers and acquisitions, German and {{international}} tax law allow for several opportunities to step up a firm’s assets, i.e., to revaluate the assets at fair market values. When a step-up is performed the taxpayer recognizes a taxable gain, but also obtains tax benefits {{in the form of}} higher future <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> associated with stepping up the tax base of the assets. This tax-planning problem is well known in taxation literature and can also be applied to firm valuation in the presence of taxation. However, the known models usually assume a perfect loss offset. If this assumption is abandoned, the <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> may lose value as they become tax effective at a later point in time, or even never if there are not enough cash flows to be offset against. This aspect is especially relevant if future cash flows are assumed to be uncertain. This paper shows that a step-up may be disadvantageous or a firm overvalued if these aspects are not integrated into the basic calculus. Compared to the standard approach, assets should be stepped up only in a few cases and — under specific conditions — ata later point in time. Firm values may be considerably lower under imperfect loss offset.|$|R
