In respect to natural gas, this plan will attempt to “take advantage of the estimated $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, especially those on federal lands that the American people own.” However, even though Trump plans on opening some of these lands closed to drilling, analysts believe that this would not only be difficult with all the regulation but also would not increase revenue as much Trump believes it would. Trump also plans on eliminating Obama's Climate Action Plan and all its regulations.|$|R

40|$|In-sample and out-of-sample Granger {{causality}} {{tests are}} applied {{to determine whether the}} real trade-weighted agricultural exchange rate helps predict monthly real prices <b>and</b> <b>export</b> sales of wheat, corn, and soybeans. An ARIMA model, alternative univariate and bivariate autoregressive models, and a restricted bivariate autoregressive model based on Hsiao's procedure are specified for each variable. Results of the causality tests are shown to be sensitive to specification choice. Forecasting performance of the models is compared and out-of-sample Granger causality is determined using univariate and bivariate models with the best (lowest mean-square forecast error) forecasting accuracy. These tests provide evidence supportive of Granger causality from the exchange rate to export sales, while the evidence on causality from the exchange rate to prices is mixed. Key words: exchange rates, Granger causality, lag length selection criteria, out-of-sample causality tests. The importance of macroeconomic-agricul-tural linkages has been evaluated empirically in recent work by, among others, Batten and Belongia (1984, 1986); Chambers and Just; and Orden (1986). While these studies employ di-verse econometric models, each supports the view that some macroeconomic variables (in particular, exchange rates) are significant de-terminants of agricultural prices <b>and</b> <b>export</b> volumes. However, a disturbing aspect of these models is their poor forecasting performance. In a recent study, Bessler and Babula explored the relationships among the Federal Reserve Board's real trade-weighted exchange rate <b>and</b> cash prices, <b>export</b> sales, <b>and</b> <b>shipments</b> of wheat from a forecasting perspective explic...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} how the importing process time affects export patterns at an establishment level. We first theoretically discuss {{the effects of}} import time on not only exports but also <b>export</b> <b>shipment</b> frequency <b>and</b> <b>exports</b> per <b>shipment.</b> Then, we derive some propositions regarding those effects. Next, by employing highly detailed customs data for Thailand from 2007 to 2011, we empirically investigate those propositions. In this study, the time to import is measured at an establishment level using {{the difference between the}} dates on which import shipments arrived in ports and then were released from the container yard. Our main finding is that a longer time reduces total exports, particularly through decreasing export frequency. Significantly negative effects on exports per shipment appear in some specific cases. A longer time to import also reduces total imports, particularly through decreasing import frequency...|$|R

40|$|Ammonia can {{accumulate}} in highly stocked sheep accommodation, for example during live <b>export</b> <b>shipments,</b> <b>and</b> could affect sheep health and welfare. Thus, {{the objective of}} this experiment was to test the effects of 4 NH 3 concentrations, 4 (control), 12, 21, and 34 mg/m(3), on the physiology and behavior of wether sheep. Sheep were held for 12 d under a micro-climate and stocking density similar to shipboard conditions recorded on voyages from Australia to the Middle East during the northern hemispheric summer. Ammonia increased macrophage activity in transtracheal aspirations, indicating active pulmonary infl ammation; however, it had no effect (P > 0. 05) on hematological variables. Feed intake decreased (P = 0. 002) in proportion to ammonia concentration, and BW gain decreased (P < 0. 001) at the 2 greatest concentrations. Exposure to ammonia increased (P = 0. 03) the frequency of sneezing, and at the greatest ammonia concentration, sheep were less active, with less locomotion, pawing, and panting. Twenty-eight days after exposure to NH 3, the pulmonary macrophage activity and BW of the sheep returned to that of sheep exposed to only 4 mg/m(3). It was concluded that NH 3 induced a temporary inflammatory response of the respiratory system and reduced BW gain, which together indicated a transitory adverse effect on the welfare of sheep...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an empirical}} approach for identifying bank specialization in ex-port markets. Combining loan <b>and</b> <b>shipment</b> data for all exporters in Peru, {{we find that}} all banks have abnormally large and persistent loan portfolio exposures {{to at least one}} export destination market. Specifications that saturate all bank-time and firm-time variation show that firms that expand exports to a country are more likely to borrow from banks that specialize in that country. This link between <b>exports</b> <b>and</b> bank specialization holds both for existing and new lending relationships. Using dif-ferential exposure to the 2008 financial crisis, we further find that shocks to the credit supply of banks has a larger effect on exports to the bank’s markets of specialization, implying that specialized bank debt is difficult to replace. These results suggest that banks have market-specific areas of expertise that are distinct from firm-specific knowl-edge gathered through relationship lending...|$|R
