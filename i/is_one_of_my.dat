25|$|I {{believe that}} it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> strong collaborations. It already has me worried about the future. This is my best moment now, {{as far as the}} match I have musically with Sakis. Without wanting to put down all the people I have collaborated with I adore them like, ex, Giorgos Mazonakis. The people who go to see Sakis musically are very close to me, in {{relation}} to those who go to see a laïko artist. The track was recorded sometime in late November at Kontopoulos' studio, coinciding with the artists' busy rehearsal schedule for The S Club. Before its release, Tamta had not heard the final result as Kontopoulos and Rouvas were in the studio up until the song's release working on the finishing touches.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News in late 2010, Rihanna spoke of how [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] {{was one of her}} favorite songs on the album, saying [...] "I love that song [...] That <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite songs on the album. It makes you feel like celebrating... It gives you a great feeling inside, like {{you want to go out}} and have a drink... People can't wait for the weekend." [...] Also in {{an interview}} with MTV News in late 2010, Avril Lavigne spoke about being included on the song, saying, [...] "It was really exciting because 'I'm With You' <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite songs that I've done, I always love performing it." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{his time}} at Bell Labs, Hamming avoided {{management}} responsibilities. He was promoted to management positions several times, but always managed to make these only temporary. [...] "I knew {{in a sense that}} by avoiding management," [...] he later recalled, [...] "I was not doing my duty by the organization. That <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> biggest failures." ...|$|E
500|$|Camouflage {{researcher}} Roy Behrens cites {{and discusses}} Adaptive Coloration frequently in his writings. For example, in his Camoupedia blog, {{related to the}} book of the same name, he writes of Cott's drawings of the hind limbs of the Common frog: [...] "Reproduced above <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite drawings from what <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite books." [...] He continues [...] "What makes these drawings (and the book itself) even more interesting is that Cott (1900-1987) was not just a zoologist—he was a highly skilled scientific illustrator (these are his own pen-and-ink drawings), a wildlife photographer, and a prominent British camoufleur in World War II." [...] Still in 2011, Behrens can write of Cott's way of thinking, citing his words as models of clear and accurate explanation of the mechanisms of camouflage: [...] "As he so aptly explained it, disruptive patterns work 'by the optical destruction of what is present', while continuous patterns work 'by the optical construction of what is not present.'" ...|$|E
500|$|I {{wanted the}} video {{to have the}} same rawness that both the melody and the lyrics of the song have because [...] "Dance for You" [...] <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> most {{intimate}} songs. I wanted the video to have a classic feel; to be seductive but still keep the sense of mystery. When I write, when I perform, and when I make music videos, I don’t hold anything back. 'Dance for You' is about that same passion; to be free and unrestrained.|$|E

500|$|That <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> biggest records ever, hype-wise, {{the music}} itself, I love {{it to the}} core. I don’t do songs {{thinking}} {{this has to be}} a hit. I do music based on how I feel from my heart and that is typically New Guy. New Guy is like a heart fulfilling type of record and to me, I think it actually hit the major impact that I wanted it to hit and people are loving it [...] My fans love it.|$|E
500|$|... "Redux II" [...] {{was highly}} praised by Carter, saying that [...] "I think that Redux II {{is one of}} the best episodes we've ever done". Frank Spotnitz said [...] "Redux II <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{favorite}} episodes. I think the story has a crystal purity and clarity, and it just comes to a perfect point for me". Anderson said [...] "I thought it was a terrific episode, especially the scenes in the hearing room, and the whole progression of Scully praying. How it was written and shot and how it was edited. Fabulous".|$|E
500|$|It {{is a great}} {{outlet for}} me to go into the studio and write a song like 'Petals', which <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> most {{personal}} songs and remains one of my favorites. I think [...] honest lyrics I've ever written. The song chronicles a lot of past emotions I've felt to certain people close to me, and the way I feel towards them and how their actions have impacted me personally. For that reason, I sang in my lower registers, trying to add that breathy effect to go {{hand in hand with the}} song's composition.|$|E

500|$|Jenna Fischer noted that, {{due to the}} {{presence}} of actual children on the set, [...] "everyone had to be on their best behavior", meaning that there was no [...] "cursing and no dirty jokes allowed". She later said that [...] "we aren't a 'G-rated' bunch by nature." [...] Fischer later joked that [...] "candy <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> weaknesses", but she was able to get through the filming of the episode without eating any of it. She explained that during the filming of the earlier second season episodes [...] "Halloween" [...] and [...] "Valentine's Day", she had eaten a majority of the candy the crew put on her desk.|$|E
500|$|New Line Cinema (one-time video {{distributor}} of the original) acquired {{the rights to}} the film from co-rights holder StudioCanal, who will control the European rights, and Carpenter, who will serve as an executive producer and said, [...] "Snake <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fondest creations. Kurt Russell did an incredible job, and {{it would be fun to}} see someone else try." [...] Russell has commented on the remake and on the casting of Butler as Plissken, saying, [...] "I will say that when I was told who was going to play Snake Plissken, my initial reaction was 'Oh, man!' [...] I do think that character was quintessentially one thing. And that is, American." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{accompanying}} Songz on 106 & Park when promoting, Ready, Drake {{explained the}} video, stating: [...] "The {{concept of the}} video {{is the fact that}} 'successful,' it applies to so many people that me and Trey just want to get the point across that we see ourselves and we see success in other individuals so really, it's a video about potential. It's a video about understanding that no matter what you do, there's a way to be successful doing it. It's one of those motivational videos. It actually ends with a quote from Barack Obama which <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite quotes I've ever read, so we decided {{to put it in the}} video. It's vivid." ...|$|E

Following Selena's death in 1995, the track has been included on Ones (2002), Momentos Intimos (2004), and La Leyenda (2010).

During {{an interview with}} La Prensa, Torres said, [...] "I invited her to sing with me when she was not well-known, and I wrote the song [...] "Bueno amigos"; that song brings back memories. People will never forget Selena and that tune <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorites." ...|$|E
500|$|Imagine co-founder Ron Howard was {{attached}} to direct the film, but turned it down after being asked by Russell Crowe to helm Cinderella Man (2004). Howard's Imagine partner Brian Grazer began {{looking for a new}} director. After Howard stepped down, Menno Meyjes contributed to Gewirtz's screenplay, and Terry George incorporated the Nazi Germany and diamond ring elements to the script. Meyjes was in negotiations to direct the film, but after he declined, Grazer thought this project was a chance to work with Spike Lee, who had already learned of Gewirtz's script. Lee said of the screenplay, [...] "I liked the script and really wanted to do it. Dog Day Afternoon,' directed by Sidney Lumet, <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite films, and this story was a contemporary take on that kind of a movie." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was very}} exciting. I got {{to write the}} attack {{at the end of}} the episode—which was very much {{something}} that happened in the comic book series—so I knew I would be revisiting something I had already written. But as we were in the writers' room, when things started shifting which led to all this new stuff that wasn't in the comic book series, I thought that was great because it wasn't me writing the same-old same-old or rewriting something I had already done and trying to make it interesting for myself. It was really an entirely new story: getting the gang members in there and getting to write Daryl [...] which <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite characters on the show, despite the fact that he’s not in the comic book. It was a blast.|$|E

500|$|Music {{journalist}} Rip Rense cites [...] "The Answer's at the End" [...] as {{an example}} of how [...] "even the rather hasty" [...] Extra Texture offers [...] "some of the most affecting moments in [...] career". With reference to the song's second verse, Rense adds: [...] "and how many songwriters have ever sung a line as wonderful as 'The speech of flowers excels the flowers of speech?'" [...] Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter recognise the song as a [...] "highlight" [...] of the album, while Elliot Huntley terms it a [...] "gorgeously melodic song of forgiveness". Huntley praises the track's [...] "epic sweep" [...] and writes of the Simone-inspired coda: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favourite moments of the entire Harrison back-catalogue, especially when the ensemble returns to see the song through to its conclusion..." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Welcome Wagon" [...] {{sees the}} {{promotion}} of four actors to star billing, two of whom, Cindy [...] "Mac" [...] Mackenzie (Tina Majorino) and Don Lamb (Michael Muhney), had previously served as recurring characters, and two of whom, Stosh [...] "Piz" [...] Piznarski (Chris Lowell) and Parker Lee (Julie Gonzalo) make their first appearance in the episode. Thomas revealed that Majorino {{was going to be}} a series regular the previous summer, a move that pleased many fans. Asked by Michael Ausiello whether Veronica and Mac would be roommates, Thomas replied that they would not, citing that such a living arrangement would prevent Veronica from having scenes with Keith. Nevertheless, Majorino commented that Mac and Veronica's relationship would continue to be close throughout the season. [...] "The friendship with Veronica <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite parts of the entire show. It's great to have two really strong personalities getting along so well." ...|$|E

In 2014, she received media attention for her weight loss transformation from a size 12 to 8. Mauboy has an alter ego named J Malley, who she described as her [...] "fearless side" [...] and [...] "sort of like Beyoncé's Sasha Fierce". Mauboy is often referred to as Australia's answer to Beyoncé. However, she does not agree with the comparisons, saying [...] "I totally disagree with that one. I've...watched her documentary [...] and was just blown away by how magnificent she really is and it's so inspiring for me. I just think she's fantastic and I'm completely nowhere near where she is, but I aspire to that." ...|$|E
