5|$|According to {{accounts}} from his life, he preached {{the importance of}} realization of the self, and criticized love towards perishable things. His teachings concentrate on a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace, and devotion to the God and guru. He {{stressed the importance of}} surrender to the true Satguru, who, having trod the path to divine consciousness, will lead the disciple through the <b>jungle</b> <b>of</b> spiritual training.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Caxias had {{organized}} {{an assault on}} the new Paraguayan defenses which López had thrown up along the Pikysyry, south of Asunción (Paraguay's capital). This stream afforded a strong defensive position which was anchored by the Paraguay River and by the swampy <b>jungle</b> <b>of</b> the Chaco region. Caxias had a road cut through the supposedly impenetrable Chaco, located {{on the other side of}} the Paraguayan River where the Allied army was camped. The Brazilian ships carried the Allied troops across the river, where they moved over the road which had been finished in December. The Allied forces outflanked the Paraguayan lines and attacked from the rear. The combined allied forces annihilated the Paraguayan army and on 1 January 1869 Asunción was occupied.|$|E

25|$|In Peru, conversos {{arrived at}} the time of the Spanish Conquest. At first, they had lived without {{restrictions}} because the Inquisition was not active there at the beginning of the Viceroyalty. With the advent of the Inquisition, New Christians began to be persecuted, and in some cases executed. The descendants of these colonial Sephardic Jewish descent converts to Christianity settled mainly in the north of the Andes and of the high <b>jungle</b> <b>of</b> Peru, where they married local women and became assimilated.|$|E

25|$|The {{battle was}} now deadlocked. At midnight on 7–8 June, a German attack was stopped cold and an American {{counter-attack}} {{in the morning}} of 8 June was similarly defeated. Sibley's battalion—having sustained nearly 400 casualties—was relieved by the 1st Battalion, 6th Marines. Major Shearer took over the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines for the wounded Berry. On 9 June, an enormous American and French barrage devastated Belleau Wood, turning the formerly attractive hunting preserve into a <b>jungle</b> <b>of</b> shattered trees. The Germans counter-fired into Lucy and Bouresches and reorganized their defenses inside Belleau Wood.|$|E

25|$|The 1960s Bull Ring Centre had {{problems}} {{from the beginning}} and was very much a product of its era. At the time of its opening it was considered the height of modernity, but higher rentals within the shopping centre meant that traders turned away from it. The public were also less inclined to use the subways and escalators, which stopped working regularly. Also, it did not age well and soon became generally regarded as an unfortunate example of 1960s Brutalist architecture, with its boxy grey concrete design and its isolation within ringroads connected only by pedestrian subways. It was, by the 1980s, much disliked by the public and contributed to the popular conception that Birmingham was a concrete <b>jungle</b> <b>of</b> shopping centres and motorways.|$|E

He arranged 500 of his Miss Piggy rings {{in the shape of}} his gun icon on a wall to offer the visitors an interactive art installation he called Wanna Swap Your Ring ?. Many visitors then used the opportunity to swap their own ring for a Noten ring, leaving a genuine <b>jungle</b> <b>of</b> rings behind. Noten commented {{he did not know what}} to do with these visitors' rings yet but that he would surely find a purpose for them.

25|$|Drum {{and bass}} {{emerged from the}} London breakbeat {{hardcore}} and rave scene of the late 1980s. Originally known as jungle, it was a pop-created fusion of hardcore, house and techno which was usually instrumental, using extremely fast polyrhythms and breakbeats and incorporating elements from dancehall, electro, funk, hip hop, house, jazz, heavy metal. Pioneered by figures like Club Rage DJs Fabio and Grooverider, in the mid-1990s the genre expanded from an underground and pirate radio scene to form subgenres including the intelligent drum and bass pioneered by LTJ Bukem, and the ambient <b>jungle</b> <b>of</b> Goldie's crossover debut Timeless (1995) and the jazzstep of Roni Size's Mercury Award-winning New Forms (1997). Subsequent artists included Shy FX, Ed Rush, 4 Hero and DJ Rap, some fusing drum and bass with influences from jazz, film music, ambient and trip-hop.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} park-like popular {{location is}} Eynali, a mountain at the north-east extremity of the city. Eynali was a barren mountain {{on top of}} which {{there was a huge}} white rectangular antenna facing Tabriz city. The old building was claimed to be a shrine that housed the burial site of an Imamzadeh (a descendant of the profit of Islam). In recent years trees have been planted on mountain slopes and the place has the appearance of a vast park. Every Friday morning many walk the site to enjoy the relatively cleaner breezes and watch the ever-growing <b>jungle</b> <b>of</b> high-rise buildings on the flat, arid plateau. Generally, the brief picnic ends with drinking a few cups of tea that has been brewed on a smoking fire. Making fire is a challenge as the scanty vegetation consists of trees that have been planted in recent years and are jealously guarded behind barbed wires. However, the crowds enjoy the challenge as a pleasant part of the weekly ritual. In older times, only groups of young men would climb near the shrine. In more recent years the presence of women is noticeable.|$|E

500|$|For the 3,200-seat design, Pflueger {{took his}} {{inspiration}} from Green Mansions, a romantic fantasy novel by William Henry Hudson {{set in the}} Guyana <b>jungle</b> <b>of</b> Venezuela. Tropical rain forest motifs were used throughout the theater, including climbing vines, waterfalls, parrots and emerald green lighting. As with his other works, Pflueger mixed together sources from around the world, adding images of Greek and Egyptian gods and goddesses as well as Egyptian lotuses to the primarily jungle theme. Plans were complete in November and in December 1930 ground was broken in a ceremony that called for [...] "prosperity celebration".|$|E
500|$|Also on {{the team}} was Roger Youderian, a 32-year-old missionary {{who had been working}} in Ecuador since 1953. Under the mission board Gospel Missionary Union, he and his wife Barbara and {{daughter}} Beth settled in Macuma, a mission station in the southern <b>jungle</b> <b>of</b> Ecuador. There, he and his wife ministered to the Shuar people, learning their language and transcribing it. After working with them for about a year, Youderian and his family began ministering to a tribe related to the Shuar, the Achuar people. He worked with Nate Saint to provide important medical supplies; but after a period of attempting to build relationships with them, he failed to see any positive effect and, growing depressed, considered returning to the United States. [...] However, during this time Saint approached him about joining their team to meet the Huaorani, and he assented.|$|E
500|$|The Huaorani {{around the}} time of Operation Auca were a small tribe occupying the <b>jungle</b> <b>of</b> Eastern Ecuador between the Napo and Curaray Rivers, an area of {{approximately}} 20,000 square kilometers (7,700mi²). They numbered approximately 600 people, and were split into three groups, all mutually hostilethe Geketaidi, the Baïidi, and the Wepeidi. They lived on the gathering and cultivation of plant foods like manioc and plantains, as well as fishing and hunting with spear and blowgun. Family units consisted of a man and his wife or wives, their unmarried sons, their married daughters and sons-in-law, and their grandchildren. [...] All of them would reside in a longhouse, which was separated by several kilometers from another longhouse in which close relatives lived. Marriage was always endogenous and typically between cousins, and arranged by the parents of the young people.|$|E
