25|$|Tampa/St. Petersburg – The largest {{rallies in}} Florida {{were held in}} Hillsborough County, whose seat is Tampa. Across the county, {{approximately}} 12% of {{middle and high school}} students were absent (five percentage points higher than the average).

25|$|The Spanish {{officials}} were amazed {{when they heard}} this and the news that they were now prisoners of war, because no dispatches or mail had arrived since April 9 to enlighten them. They were then paroled <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> they promised to return to Agana to inform {{the governor of the}} war and notify him to appear on board the American ship immediately. The party then went below deck into the captain's cabin to discuss the surrender of the island.|$|E
25|$|He was {{secretly}} {{contacted by the}} Allies, who gave him the code name Kingpin. Giraud was already planning <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> American troops landed in France. He agreed to support an Allied landing in French North Africa, provided that only American troops were used (like many other French officers he was bitterly resentful of the British, particularly after their attack on Mers-el-Kébir), and that he or another French officer was the commander of such an operation. He considered this latter condition essential to maintaining French sovereignty and authority over the Arab and Berber natives of North Africa.|$|E
50|$|In 1936, Paul L. Dysart, Jr. began accumulating two {{series of}} {{advances}} and declines distinguished by whether volume was {{greater or lesser}} than <b>the</b> prior <b>day’s</b> volume. He called <b>the</b> cumulative series <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> volume had been greater than <b>the</b> prior <b>day’s</b> volume <b>the</b> Positive Volume Index (PVI), and <b>the</b> series <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> volume had been lesser the Negative Volume Index (NVI).|$|R
50|$|Dysart {{calculated}} NVI as follows: 1) if today’s {{volume is}} less than yesterday’s volume, subtract declines from advances, 2) add the difference to the cumulative NVI beginning at zero, and 3) retain the current NVI reading <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> volume is greater than <b>the</b> prior <b>day’s</b> volume. He calculated PVI {{in the same manner}} but <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> volume was greater than <b>the</b> prior <b>day’s</b> volume. NVI and PVI can be calculated daily or weekly.|$|R

25|$|I {{have long}} been gravitating towards the Socialist {{position}} — {{of course there is}} Socialism and Socialism, and mine is of the reasonable and moderate kind. When I look over my public efforts through the years, {{it seems to me that}} I have been a Socialist all my life. So far as any Party can express what appears to me to be the country's needs, the ILP approximates nearer to my outlook that any other, although I still look forward to and hope <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> all really progressive forces can unite under the title of the Democratic Party. But Liberalism as represented by both wings — the Lloyd George wing, and the Asquith wing, is right outside my outlook now.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, {{there came}} into being {{the idea of a}} select corps of teenaged youths, who would devote some of their spare time to prepare <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> they would take their places in the ranks of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). In 1940, Air Minister Power, who was very much aware of the need for this type of Air Cadet training, called in a group of {{influential}} civilians and asked them to set up a national voluntary organization to sponsor and develop this movement. The response was immediate, and a civilian organization was soon created to work on a partnership basis with the RCAF. As it later developed, this partnership was to be the main reason for the striking success of the Air Cadet Movement in Canada.|$|E
25|$|The wave {{of direct}} action spread to Alberta when Premier Peter Lougheed and his Conservatives won power in 1971, ending 36 years of Social Credit rule. Lougheed's {{elaborate}} election platform, titled New Directions, sounded themes common among OPEC countries by pledging to create provincial resources and oil growth companies, collect {{a greater share}} of energy revenues, and foster economic diversification to prepare <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> petroleum reserves ran out. The idea of limited resources emerged from the realm of theory into hard facts of policy when the NEB rejected natural-gas export applications in 1970 and 1971, on grounds that there was no surplus and Canada needed the supplies. The strength of the new conservationist sentiment was underlined when the NEB stuck to its guns despite a 1971 declaration by the federal Department of Energy that it thought Canada had a 392-year supply of natural gas and enough oil for 923 years.|$|E

25|$|Here {{she enters}} the Crypt, a giant {{monolithic}} construct {{from before the}} Seven Days of Fire. She learns that the last scientists of the industrial era had foreseen {{the end of their}} civilization. They created the Sea of Corruption to clean the land of pollution, altered human genes to cope with the changed ecology, stored their own personalities inside the Crypt and waited <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> they could re-emerge, leaving the world at the mercy of their artificially created caretaker. However, their continual manipulation of the population and the world's environment is at odds with Nausicaä's belief in the natural order. She argues that mankind's behaviour has not been improved significantly by the activities of those inside the crypt. Strife and cycles of violence have continued to plague the world in the thousand years following their interference. She orders the God-Warrior to destroy its progenitors, forcing humanity to live or die without further influence from the old society's technology.|$|E

He gives her the key to open the Gates of Eden. Meanwhile, the Daytron flagship, the Emperor attacks Salgin. Valkog demands the key from Jaster {{who is about to}} acquiesce, when Raul fires an electromagnetic pulse at the Emperor, partially disabling it. However, the ship fires on Raul's church before retreating. Raul dies in Jaster's arms after giving him an artifact which points to the apparently deserted Kuje Desert. In the middle of Kuje, the party find a village, Joannasburg. There, they meet the spirit of the long dead Joanna (C. C. Seymour). She explains she is a descendent of the Star King, as is her son; Jaster. Desert Claw arrives, telling Jaster he is his father. He gave Jaster to Raul while he prepared <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> Jaster would awaken the power of the Star King and open the Gates of Eden.|$|E

25|$|In the Ashkenazi tradition, {{each night}} after the {{lighting}} of the candles, the hymn Ma'oz Tzur is sung. The song contains six stanzas. The first and last deal with general themes of divine salvation, and the middle four deal with events of persecution in Jewish history, and praises God for survival despite these tragedies (the exodus from Egypt, the Babylonian captivity, the miracle of the holiday of Purim, the Hasmonean victory), and a longing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> Judea will finally triumph over Rome.|$|R

5|$|Sharp was re-elected to the Fourteenth Congress, {{during which}} he served as {{chairman}} of the Committee on Private Land Claims.
