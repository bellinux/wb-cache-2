40|$|Forensic {{examination}} of evidence holds {{the promise of}} making claims about the truth of certain propositions with the inherent accuracy and reliability that characterises scientific endeavours. The propositions may relate to the artefacts examined or related artefacts. The nature of propositions about which claims can be made depend {{on the extent to}} which given propositions fall within the ambit of scientific knowledge and {{on the extent to which}} the examined evidence is suitable for the application of established science. A continuing series of incidents illustrate that in many forensic disciplines that promise is not met — often because some branch of forensic science happen to not being scientific at all. In fact, serious assessments of forensic science have shown that many (if not most) branches of forensic science are not scientifically valid. <b>Digital</b> <b>forensic</b> <b>science</b> is one of the newest members of the family of forensic sciences.

30|$|<b>Forensic</b> <b>science</b> {{has been}} a key pillar in {{criminal}} justice system {{all over the world}} (Petherick et al., 2010). In Pakistan, forensic has been ignored for a long time. The ongoing terrorism gave a wake-up call to the establishment and untiring efforts were made for the establishing and proper functioning of the forensic laboratory to help criminal investigations (Petherick et al., 2009). Since 2001, authorities have been revamping <b>forensic</b> <b>science</b> infrastructure across the country to aid crime investigation. The National <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> Agency (NFSA) was approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) as an autonomous body in 2002 having departments of crime scene Investigation, trace chemistry, questioned documents and <b>digital</b> <b>forensics</b> (National <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> Agency, n.d.). Its objective was to help establish other <b>forensic</b> <b>science</b> laboratories across the country and to provide teaching and training facilities throughout Pakistan, which is still not achieved. In Punjab province, Punjab <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> Agency (PFSA) Act was passed on October 2007 for the establishment of the <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> Agency which ultimately lead to the establishment of the Punjab <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> Agency on 2012 having fourteen departments under one roof. The departments include audio video analysis, computer forensic unit, crime and death scene, DNA and serology, forensic photography, narcotics, toxicology, trace evidence, polygraph, firearm and tool marks, latent fingerprints, pathology and questioned documents (Punjab <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> Agency, n.d.). In Sindh province, Sindh <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> Agency act was passed on August, 2017 but so far no laboratory has been established. DNA testing facility available in Jamshoro, Sindh which provides research as well as forensic DNA testing. Besides this, government of Sindh is making efforts for establishment of Forensic DNA testing laboratory in Karachi University. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police has established <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> Laboratory and Institute of <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> in Peshawar on December, 2017 to provide preliminary forensic facilities and {{to bridge the gap between}} forensic awareness and criminal investigation practices. In Balochistan province of Punjab, an act was passed for the establishment of Balochistan <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> Agency on August, 2015 but no forensic facility has yet been established. At present, NFSA and PFSA are providing many important investigation leads in various hideous crimes. The advent of DNA data base recently at PFSA has proved a major breakthrough in solving crimes through DNA profile comparison, not only exonerating the innocent, but also in catching the real culprit (Punjab <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> Agency, n.d.). Now general public and judiciary of Pakistan are relying heavily on Forensic evidences in trial cases and making decisions. As <b>forensic</b> <b>science</b> popularity increases in the country so does the backlog. More and more cases are being received each day which is causing delay in the case processing and ultimately delayed justice.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare and {{contrast}} the efforts of two universities to address the issue of providing computer forensics students with the opportunity to get involved in the practical aspects of forensic search and seizure procedures. The paper discusses the approaches undertaken by the University of Sunderland and the University of South Wales (Glamorgan) to give the students the opportunity to process a case from the crime scene through to the court room. In order to do this both institutions adopted a problem based learning (PBL) approach – to reflect real-world solutions and encourage students to work in groups to seek further knowledge and understanding of the various processes and procedures – in particular the steps around search and seizure of digital evidence from a crime scene. The PBL activities at Sunderland and Glamorgan were designed in order to help the students understand the processes of digital crime scene analysis and search and seizure procedures and to give them the opportunity to put into practice their <b>digital</b> <b>forensics</b> techniques. Both exercises were designed to give the opportunity to solve realistic problems using PBL, and to illustrate the inter-relationships between science, technology, and human activity as it applies to <b>digital</b> <b>forensics,</b> <b>forensic</b> <b>science</b> and the criminal justice system.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Digital</b> <b>forensics</b> is the <b>science</b> of {{laws and}} {{technologies}} fighting computer crimes. It {{can be divided into}} two sub-areas, computer forensics and network forensics. Network forensics is still a frontier area of <b>digital</b> <b>forensics</b> and is the focus of this paper. We propose to classify network forensic investigations into three categories based on when law enforcement officers conduct investigations in response to cyber crime incidents. We define proactive investigations as those occurring before cyber crime incidents; real time investigations as those occurring during cyber crime incidents, and retroactive investigation as those occurring after cyber crime incidents. This classification in terms of incident timing helps us understand related laws since laws differ with investigation timing. We present a holistic study of the relationship between laws and network forensic investigations and believe that this framework provides a solid guide for <b>digital</b> <b>forensic</b> research. For example, the framework tells us that certain strategies (including technologies transformed from attacks against security systems) would violate the Constitution or relevant laws of the United States, which is the focus of this paper.
