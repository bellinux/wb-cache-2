5|$|Rivera rebounded in 2008 {{and began}} the year with 16consecutive {{scoreless}} innings pitched and 28consecutive save opportunities converted, both personal bests to start a season. His first-half performance, highlighted by a 1.06ERA and 23saves in as many opportunities, garnered him his ninth All-Star selection. Leading up to the 2008 MLB All-Star Game, which was held at Yankee Stadium in the venue's final year of existence, a few sportswriters proposed making Rivera the AL's starting pitcher {{as a tribute to}} him and his home ballpark. He instead was used as a reliever in the AL's extra-inning win. In the final month of the season, he recorded two milestones: on September15, he recorded his 479th save to pass Lee Smith for second all-time in regular season saves; on September21, in the final game at Yankee Stadium, Rivera threw the <b>final</b> <b>pitch</b> in the venue's history, retiring Brian Roberts of the Baltimore Orioles on a ground-out. After the Yankees missed the postseason {{for the first time in}} his career, Rivera disclosed that he had suffered from shoulder pain throughout the year. Tests revealed calcification of the acromioclavicular joint in his throwing shoulder, for which he underwent minor arthroscopic surgery in the offseason.|$|E
25|$|Clemens {{was forced}} to leave Game 3 of the 2007 ALDS in the third inning after {{aggravating}} a hamstring injury. He struck out Victor Martinez of the Cleveland Indians with his <b>final</b> <b>pitch,</b> and was replaced by right-hander Phil Hughes. Yankees manager Joe Torre removed Clemens from the roster due to his injury, and replaced him with left-hander Ron Villone.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} 1991 World Series {{was ranked}} by ESPN {{to be the}} best ever played, with four games decided on the <b>final</b> <b>pitch</b> and three games going into extra innings. The Twins and their opponent, the Atlanta Braves, had each finished last in their respective divisions in the year before winning their league pennant, something that had never happened before.|$|E

50|$|Fuentes was {{regarded}} as a top prospect in the Pilots organization {{at the time of his}} death. Because of the Pilots' move to Milwaukee in 1970 to become the Brewers, Fuentes holds the distinction of throwing the <b>final</b> <b>pitches</b> in the history of the Seattle Pilots.|$|R
50|$|On August 20, {{pitchers}} Jack Kralick and Al Schroll each hit a {{home run}} against the Los Angeles Angels—the sixth and <b>final</b> <b>pitching</b> duo {{to do so in the}} same game. On September 27, Schroll took a no-hitter into the ninth inning before giving up four runs on two walks and two hits.|$|R
25|$|Ryan's very durable arm {{finally gave}} out in Seattle on September 22, 1993, when he tore a ligament, ending his career two starts earlier than planned. Briefly {{attempting}} to pitch past the injury, Ryan threw one further pitch after tearing his ligament; with his injured arm, his <b>final</b> <b>pitch</b> was measured at 98 miles per hour. Ryan's last start was his career worst; he allowed a single, four walks, and {{a grand slam}} {{in the top of}} the first without recording an out. It was his record setting 10th grand slam given up of his career. (Ryan left trailing 5–0, and the fourth walk was completed by a reliever after Ryan's injury, but credited to Ryan.) Greg Myers of the California Angels was the last strikeout victim of Nolan Ryan's career, on September 17, 1993.|$|E

Finally, more than 50 of the region's Fortune 100 and 500 CEOs gathered {{at the home of}} Senator Jackie Speier in a <b>final</b> <b>pitch</b> culminating in a performance by Beach Blanket Babylon.|$|E
500|$|After {{designing}} the show, {{the two had}} significant difficulties getting the series green lit. It was not picked up for fifteen years. In their <b>final</b> <b>pitch</b> to the Walt Disney Company, the creators designed a recorded storyboard, featuring a very rough outline of characters. The prototype Phineas was ruder to others than the version in the eventual show, where the creators decided to make him more kind. Citing comedy's [...] "big duos" [...] including Wallace and Gromit and Jay and Silent Bob, the creators chose to give Phineas most of the dialogue while Ferb remains almost silent.|$|E

50|$|During Spring {{training}} 2011, Mateo was on {{the roster}} bubble for {{a spot in the}} bullpen and was in a race with veterans Carlos Silva and Braden Looper for the <b>final</b> <b>pitching</b> spot on the team.

500|$|Frog cakes {{have long}} been {{regarded}} as a South Australian icon, and have at times been used to help promote the state. For example, in 2001 frog cakes were given to judges during Joan Hall's <b>final</b> <b>pitch</b> in a successful bid to win the 2007 World Police and Fire Games for Adelaide. While there have been tongue-in-cheek and satirical suggestions to build monuments to the frog cake, such as that made by Peter Goers, a more realistic recognition of the frog cake came in 2001 when {{it was one of}} the first items to be selected as a South Australian Icon by the National Trust of South Australia during the 165th anniversary of the state, adding the frog cake to the National Heritage Listing as a [...] "movable asset".|$|E
500|$|In {{the bottom}} of the 11th inning, Granderson robbed the speedy Jarrod Dyson of a multi-base hit with a running, leaping catch that {{prevented}} what probably would have been a lead-off triple. The Mets went on {{to get out of the}} inning. In {{the bottom of}} the 14th, Escobar reached first on a throwing error by David Wright, and Bartolo Colón gave up a base hit to Ben Zobrist, allowing Escobar to reach third. Hosmer hit a sacrifice fly to Granderson in right field to drive in the winning run. [...] This was the first time in World Series history that the same player scored both the first run of the game on the first pitch, and the last run of the game on the <b>final</b> <b>pitch.</b> The game ended at 12:18 AM CDT, lasting five hours and nine minutes. The game tied the record for the longest game by innings in World Series history, shared with Game 2 in the 1916 World Series and Game 3 in the 2005 World Series. The loss made Colón the oldest player ever to lose a World Series game.|$|E

5|$|On July 17 at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, deGrom {{pitched a}} {{complete}} game shutout against the Philadelphia Phillies, allowing only one hit and one walk while striking out seven opposing batters. His game score of 97 was tied for second-best in Mets {{history in a}} nine-inning game. DeGrom's <b>final</b> <b>pitching</b> appearance of the season came on September 1, when he faced the Miami Marlins. He underwent season-ending surgery on his ulnar nerve in late September in order to relieve discomfort in his elbow and numbness in his fingers which had plagued him during the 2016 season.|$|R

50|$|For example, on March 14, 2000, the Red Sox used six {{pitchers}} {{to achieve}} a 5-0 perfect game victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. A perfect game is considered a crowning accomplishment {{during the regular season}} or postseason, but in spring training it attracts little notice. Starting pitcher Pedro Martínez, who lost a perfect game in extra innings in 1995 while pitching for the former Montreal Expos, was talking to reporters {{at the conclusion of the}} game, rather than watching the <b>final</b> <b>pitches.</b> Reliever Rod Beck, who finished the game, did not realize the nature of his accomplishment until informed by catcher Joe Sidall. Many fans also left before the game's conclusion.|$|R
2500|$|Gladstone's RBI-double was the <b>final</b> <b>pitch</b> for Adam Blackley, having {{scattered}} 4 hits over innings pitched, {{striking out}} 7 and allowing 3runs, only 1 {{of which was}} earned. He was replaced by Matthew Blackmore, who pitched into the ninth inning, allowing only 1hit and striking out 4 over 5innings pitched. Neither starting pitcher pitched beyond the fourth inning, as South Australia's Paul Mildren was also replaced after [...] innings, allowing 7hits and 5runs (4earned), and striking out 3.|$|E
2500|$|Declarative {{sentences}} show a 2–3–1 pitch pattern. If {{the last}} syllable is prominent the final decline in pitch is a glide. For example, in This is fun, this is is at pitch 2, and fun starts at level 3 and glides down to level 1. But if the last prominent syllable {{is not the}} last syllable of the utterance, the pitch fall-off is a step. For example, in That can be frustrating, That can be has pitch 2, frus- has level 3, and both syllables of -trating have pitch 1. Wh-questions work the same way, as in Who (2) will (2) help (3↘1)? and Who (2) did (3) it (1)?. But if something is left unsaid, the <b>final</b> <b>pitch</b> level 1 is replaced by pitch 2. Thus in John's (2) sick (3↘2) ..., with the speaker indicating more to come, John's has pitch 2 while sick starts at pitch 3 and drops only to pitch 2.|$|E
2500|$|The Psalms are sung at Matins and Vespers in a {{rotating}} schedule {{so that all}} 150 Psalms are chanted every two weeks. [...] The Psalms are each sung to a psalm tone, with a simple antiphon between each verse. [...] The system of psalm tones in Ambrosian chant differs in several respects from the Gregorian system of psalm tones. [...] In the Gregorian system, psalm tones {{are based on the}} mode of the antiphon. [...] Ambrosian chants, including psalm antiphons, do not conform to the Gregorian system of modes. [...] Each Ambrosian psalm antiphon belongs to one of four different series depending on its <b>final</b> <b>pitch.</b> [...] Within each series, there are several possible psalm tones corresponding to the predominant pitch of the antiphon, {{which may or may not}} correspond to the [...] "dominant" [...] pitch of Gregorian modes. [...] Finally, each psalm tone is given a cadential formula that lets the tone segue smoothly back into the antiphon. [...] This system results in a much larger number of possible psalm tones in Ambrosian chant than exists in Gregorian chant. [...] Structurally, psalm tones in Ambrosian chant consist of an incipit, a recitation formula, and a cadence, lacking the mediant flex found in Gregorian psalm tones.|$|E

50|$|Dinneen {{joined the}} AL umpiring staff on September 12, 1909, just 17 {{days after his}} <b>final</b> <b>pitching</b> {{appearance}} with the Browns. He umpired in eight World Series (1911, 1914, 1916, 1920, 1924, 1926, 1929, 1932), tying the AL record set by Tommy Connolly. He served as crew chief for the 1914, 1926 and 1932 Series. He was also selected {{to work in the}} first All-Star game in 1933, calling balls and strikes {{for the first half of}} the game before giving way to the NL's Bill Klem. He was the third base umpire for the game on June 23, 1917 in which Ernie Shore replaced Babe Ruth with no one out and a runner on first base in the first inning, after Ruth was ejected for arguing the calls of plate umpire Brick Owens and then striking Owens. Shore retired the runner as well as all 26 batters he faced.|$|R

500|$|After a stay of six weeks, Black was {{released}} from the hospital in late October 1948. He continued to suffer from headaches, however, and had to have further surgery done in December to remove a weak spot in an artery near his head. He {{was released}} from the hospital shortly afterward, but by the start of 1949 his time with the Indians was over, as Bill Veeck stated he would not accept the responsibility of allowing Black to pitch again, though said [...] "If Black is determined to try it again, I won't stand in his way." [...] This statement, however, did not keep Black away, as he signed a contract in late January with the Indians for the same amount as the previous season. After pitching with the Indians in Florida for spring training, he returned to Cleveland and decided to retire temporarily, citing that he felt too weak to be effective. He made one <b>final</b> <b>pitching</b> appearance before retiring in an exhibition game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 13, pitching two innings for the Indians in a 10 loss.|$|R
