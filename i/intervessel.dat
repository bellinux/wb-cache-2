25|$|The {{available}} {{space for}} air and moisture in wood {{depends on the}} density and porosity of wood. Porosity is the volume fraction of void space in a solid. The porosity {{is reported to be}} 1.2 to 4.6% of dry volume of wood cell wall (Siau, 1984). On the other hand, permeability {{is a measure of the}} ease with which fluids are transported through a porous solid under the influence of some driving forces, e.g. capillary pressure gradient or moisture gradient. It is clear that solids must be porous to be permeable, but it does not necessarily follow that all porous bodies are permeable. Permeability can only exist if the void spaces are interconnected by openings. For example, a hardwood may be permeable because there is <b>intervessel</b> pitting with openings in the membranes (Keey et al., 2000). If these membranes are occluded or encrusted, or if the pits are aspirated, the wood assumes a closed-cell structure and may be virtually impermeable. The density is also important for impermeable hardwoods because more cell-wall material is traversed per unit distance, which offers increased resistance to diffusion (Keey et al., 2000). Hence lighter woods, in general, dry more rapidly than do the heavier woods. The transport of fluids is often bulk flow (momentum transfer) for permeable softwoods at high temperature while diffusion occurs for impermeable hardwoods (Siau, 1984). These mechanisms are discussed below.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: According to the {{air-seeding}} hypothesis, embolism vulnerability in xylem elements {{is linked}} directly to bordered pit structure and functioning. To elucidate the adaptive potential of <b>intervessel</b> pits towards fluctuating environmental conditions, two mangrove species {{with a distinct}} ecological distribution growing along a natural salinity gradient were investigated. Methods: Scanning and transmission electron microscopic observations were conducted to obtain qualitative and quantitative characteristics of alternate <b>intervessel</b> pits in A. marina and scalariform <b>intervessel</b> pits in Rhizophora mucronata. Wood samples from three to six trees were collected at seven and five sites for A. marina and R. mucronata, respectively, with considerable differences between sites in soil water salinity. Key Results: Vestured pits without visible pores in the pit membrane were observed in A. marina, the mangrove species with the widest geographical distribution on global {{as well as local}} scale. Their thick pit membranes (on average 370 nm) and minute pit apertures may contribute to reduced vulnerability to cavitation of this highly salt-tolerant species. The smaller ecological distribution of R. mucronata was in accordance with wide pit apertures and a slightly higher pitfield fraction (67 % vs. 60 % in A. marina). Nonetheless, its outer pit apertures were observed to be funnel-shaped shielding non-porous pit membranes. No trends in <b>intervessel</b> pit size were observed with increasing soil water salinity of the site. Conclusions: The contrasting ecological distribution of two mangrove species was reflected in the geometry and pit membrane characteristics of their <b>intervessel</b> pits. Within species, <b>intervessel</b> pit size seemed to be independent of spatial variations in environmental conditions and was only weakly correlated with vessel diameter. Further research on pit formation and function has to clarify the large variations in <b>intervessel</b> pit size within trees and even within single vessels...|$|E

The terminol-ogy and methodology used followed the iAWA List of Microscopic Features for Hardwood identification of the iAWA Committee, 1989. Measurements from each specimen were averaged (vessel diameters, vessel element lengths, <b>intervessels</b> pit size, fibre lengths and ray height).

40|$|Symptom {{development}} of Pierce’s disease (PD) in grapevine (Vitis vinifera) {{depends largely on}} the ability of the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa to use cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) to break up <b>intervessel</b> pit membranes (PMs) and spread through the vessel system. In this study, an immunohistochemical technique was developed to analyze pectic and hemicellulosic polysaccharides of <b>intervessel</b> PMs. Our results indicate that PMs of grapevine genotypes with different PD resistance differed in the composition and structure of homogalacturonans (HGs) and xyloglucans (XyGs), the potential targets of the pathogen’s CWDEs. The PMs of PD-resistant grapevine genotypes lacked fucosylated XyGs and weakly methyl-esterified HGs (ME-HGs), and contained a small amount of heavily ME-HGs. In contrast, PMs of PD-susceptible genotypes all had substantial amounts of fucosylated XyGs and weakly ME-HGs, but lacked heavily ME-HGs. The <b>intervessel</b> PM integrity and the pathogen’s distribution in Xylella-infected grapevines also showed differences among the genotypes. In pathogen-inoculated, PD-resistant genotypes PM integrity was well maintained and Xylella cells were only found close to the inoculation site. However, in inoculated PD-susceptible genotypes, PMs in the vessels associated with bacteria lost their integrity and the systemic presence of the X. fastidiosa pathogen was confirmed. Our analysis also provided a relatively clear understanding of the process by which <b>intervessel</b> PMs are degraded. All of these observations support the conclusion that weakly ME-HGs and fucosylated XyGs are substrates of the pathogen’s CWDEs and their presence in or absence from PMs may contribute to grapevine’s PD susceptibility...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} pressure difference (DeltaP) on <b>intervessel</b> pit membrane porosity was studied in two angiosperm tree species with differing pit architecture. Fraxinus americana L. possesses typical angiosperm bordered pit structure while Sophora japonica L. exhibits well-developed vestures in <b>intervessel</b> pit chambers. It was hypothesized (a) that large DeltaP across <b>intervessel</b> pits {{would cause the}} deflection of pit membranes in the stems of F. americana resulting in significant increases in porosity and thus lower cavitation thresholds, and (b) {{that the presence of}} vestures would prevent the deflection of pit membranes in S. japonica. To determine if the porosity of pit membranes increased under mechanical stress, suspensions of colloidal gold, 5 nm and 20 nm in diameter, were perfused across <b>intervessel</b> pit membranes at DeltaP ranging from 0. 25 MPa to 6. 0 MPa. The effect of increasing DeltaP on membrane porosity was also tested by comparing air seeding thresholds (P-a) in stems perfused with water or a solution with lower surface tension. Air seeding and colloidal gold experiments indicated that pit membrane porosity increased significantly with DeltaP in F. americana. In S. japonica, increases in permeability to colloidal gold with DeltaP were small and maximum pore diameters predicted from P-a were independent of DeltaP, suggesting that vestures limited {{the degree to which the}} membrane can be deflected from the centre of the pit cavity.

These hypotheses were tested on wood of 10 Prunus species showing a range in P 50 (i. e., the pressure corresponding to 50 % loss of hydraulic conductivity) from − 3. 54 to − 6. 27  MPa. Hydraulically relevant wood characters were quantified using light and electron microscopy. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to investigate evolutionary correlations using a phylogenetically independent contrast (PIC) analysis. Vessel-grouping characters {{were found to}} be most informative in explaining interspecific variation in P 50, with cavitation-resistant species showing more solitary vessels than less resistant species. Co-evolution between vessel-grouping indices and P 50 was reported. P 50 was weakly correlated with the shape of the <b>intervessel</b> pit aperture, but not with the total <b>intervessel</b> pit membrane area per vessel.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the hypothesis that}} water stress-induced xylem embolism is caused by air aspirated into functional vessels from neighboring embolized ones (e. g. embolized by physical damage) via pores in <b>intervessel</b> pit membranes. The following experiments with sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) support the hypothesis. (a) Most vessels in dehydrating stem segments embolized at xylem pressures 3 megapascals. This same pressure difference {{was found to be}} sufficient to force air across <b>intervessel</b> pits from air injection experiments of hydrated stem segments. This suggests air entry at pits is causing embolism in dehydrating stems. (b) Treatments that increased the permeability of <b>intervessel</b> pits to air injection also caused xylem to embolize at less negative xylem pressures. Permeability was increased either by perfusing stems with solutions of surface tension below that of water or by perfusion with a solution of oxalic acid and calcium. The mechanism of oxalic-calcium action on permeability is unknown, but may relate to the ability of oxalate to chelate calcium from the pectate fraction of the pit membrane.

40|$|Ion-mediated {{enhancement}} of the hydraulic conductivity of xylem tissue (i. e., the ionic effect) {{has been reported}} for various angiosperm species. One explanation of the ionic effect {{is that it is}} caused by the swelling and shrinking of <b>intervessel</b> pit membranes due to the presence of pectins and/or other cell wall matrix polymers such as heteroxylans or arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) that may contain acidic sugars. Here, we examined the ionic effect for six Acer species and their pit membrane chemistry using immunocytochemistry, including antibodies against glycoproteins. Moreover, anatomical features related to the bordered pit morphology and vessel dimensions were investigated using light and electron microscopy. The ionic effect varied from 18 % (± 9) to 32 % (± 13). Epitopes of homogalacturonan (LM 18) and xylan (LM 11) were not detected in <b>intervessel</b> pit membranes. Negative results were also obtained for glycoproteins (extensin: LM 1, JIM 20; AGP glycan: LM 2), although AGP (JIM 13) related epitopes were detected in parenchyma cells. The mean vessel length was significantly correlated with the magnitude of the ionic effect, unlike other pit or vessel related characteristics. Our results suggest that <b>intervessel</b> pit membranes of Acer are unlikely to contain pectic or other acidic polysaccharides.

40|$|Summary • <b>Intervessel</b> pits act as {{safety valves}} that {{prevent the spread}} of xylem embolism. Pectin–calcium {{crosslinks}} within the pit membrane have been proposed to affect xylem vulnerability to cavitation. However, as the chemical composition of pit membranes is poorly understood, this hypothesis has not been verified. • Using electron microscopy, immunolabeling, an antimonate precipitation tech-nique, and ruthenium red staining, we studied the distribution of selected polysaccharides and calcium in the pit membranes of four angiosperm tree species. We tested whether shifts in xylem vulnerability resulting from perfusion of stems with a calcium chelating agent corresponded with the distribution of pectic homo-galacturonans (HG) and ⁄or calcium within interconduit pit membranes. • No HG were detected in the main part of <b>intervessel</b> pit membranes, but were consistently found in the marginal membrane region known as the annulus. Calcium colocalized with HG in the annulus. In contrast to <b>intervessel</b> pits, the membrane of vessel-ray pits showed a high pectin content. • The presence of two distinct chemical domains, the annulus and the actual pit membrane, can have substantial implications for pit membrane functioning. We propose that the annulus could affect the observed shift in xylem vulnerability after calcium removal by allowing increased pit membrane deflection...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWood {{anatomical}} data {{is presented}} for 29 southern African shrubby species representing eight genera (Aspalathus, Calobota, Crotalaria, Leobordea, Lotononis, Rafnia, Wiborgia, Wiborgiella) of the predominantly African tribe Crotalarieae (Fabaceae). The taxa examined share short vessel elements, exclusively simple perforation plates and vestured <b>intervessel</b> pits, i. e. the wood traits that are typical {{for many other}} genera of Papilionoideae. The loss of helical thickenings may {{be considered as a}} synapomorphy for Crotalarieae, with a reversal to this character state within Lotononis. Generally, the pattern of wood structure diversity within the Crotalarieae is related more to the growth habits of the plants and probably to environmental factors than to their taxonomy or phylogenetic relationships. All genera (except Crotalaria) and practically all species studied showed diagonal to dendritic arrangement of vessel groups, up to their fusion into large dendritic aggregations in Calobota species from arid (non-fynbos) regions. Some species from karroid scrubs (Calobota angustifolia, Calobota cytisoides) and fynbos (Aspalathus excelsa, Aspalathus linearis, Aspalathus nigra) show no dendritic vessel pattern, however. The banded axial parenchyma appears independently in three lineages of Crotalarieae, i. e. in Aspalathus+Wiborgia+Wiborgiella, Rafnia, and in crown species of Calobota. Lotononis s. str. and Leobordea show unbranched or weakly branched coarse vestures in their <b>intervessel</b> pits, whereas other taxa examined share the presence of vestures, appearing as strongly branched fine protuberances.

Wood samples were taken at different heights from the mangrove tree Rhizophora mucronata growing at Gazi Bay (Kenya). Additional samples were taken along the stem radius to distinguish height from age effect, and from six other mangrove species growing in the same forest. <b>Intervessel</b> pit membranes were studied via transmission and scanning electron microscopy and cellular UV-microspectrophotometry.

40|$|Reporting Period: The results {{reported}} here are from work conducted September 2004 to June 2005. Grapevine xylem {{is composed of}} vessels connected by <b>intervessel</b> bordered pits with pit membranes that prevent the passive movement of particles, especially at the stem-leaf junction where most vessels end.

However, bacteria such as Yersinia enterocolitica (Ye) and fluorescent beads have been observed moving rapidly within the grapevine xylem, suggesting a pathway for passive movement. In this report, we used air and latex paint to confirm the existence a xylem vessel pathway from stems into the leaf lamina. Anatomical investigation of the leaf xylem revealed a switch from vessels to tracheids at about 50 - 60 % the length of the leaf lamina. In addition, inoculations of gfp-Xf showed that bacteria never reached the leaf margin where the symptoms appear, suggesting that tracheids inhibited the free movement of Xf...|$|E

40|$|Summary Tumour pH plays a {{significant}} role in cancer treatment. However, because of the limitations of the current measurement techniques, spatially and temporally resolved pH data, obtained non-invasively in solid tumours, are not available. Fluorescence ratio imaging microscopy (FRIM) has been used previously for noninvasive, dynamic evaluation of pH in neoplastic tissue in vivo (Martin GR, Jain RK 1994, Cancer Res., 54, 5670 - 5674). However, owing to problems associated with quantitative fluorescence in thick biological tissues, these studies were limited to thin (50 pm) tumours. We, therefore, adapted the FRIM technique for pH determination in thick (z 2 mm) solid tumours in vivo using a pinhole illumination-optical sectioning (PIOS) method. Results show that (1) steep interstitial pH gradients (5 Mm resolution), with different spatial patterns, exist between tumour blood vessels; (2) pH decreased by an average of 0. 10 pH units over a distance of 40 gm away from the blood vessel wall, and by 0. 33 pH units over a 70 pm distance; (3) the maximum pH drop, defined as the pH difference between the <b>intervessel</b> midpoint and the vessel wall, was positively correlated with the <b>intervessel</b> distance; (4) 45 min following a systemic glucose injection (6 g kg- ' i. v.), interstitial pH gradients were shifted to lower pH values by an average of 0. 15 pH units, while the spatial gradient (slope) was maintained, when compared with preglucose values.

It is worth mentioning that the sampling was realized in only one studied site (Ilha Grande), which contributed to the conclusion that the wood characteristics are more related to the specificities of each studied taxon than to with environmental variations...|$|E
40|$|The {{bordered pit}} {{structure}} in tracheary elements of 105 Boraginaceae species is studied using {{scanning electron microscopy}} to examine the systematic distribution of vestured pits. Forty-three species out of 16 genera show a uniform presence of this feature throughout their secondary xylem. Most vestures are small, unbranched and associated with the outer pit aperture of bordered <b>intervessel</b> pits. The feature {{is likely to have}} originated independently in the distantly related subfamilies Boraginoideae (tribe Lithospermeae) and Ehretioideae. The distribution of vestures in Ehretia agrees with recent molecular phylogenies: (1) species with vestured pits characterise the Ehretia I group (incl. Rotula), and (2) species with non-vestured pits belong to the Ehretia II group (incl. Carmona). The occurrence of vestured pits in Hydrolea provides additional support for excluding this genus from Hydrophylloideae, since Hydrolea is the only species of this subfamily with vestured pits. Functional advantages of vestured pits promoting parallel evolution of this conservative feature are suggested. The hydraulic benefits of poorly developed vestures remain underinvestigated. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Vulnerability to {{cavitation}} and conductive efficiency {{depend on}} xylem anatomy. We tested a large range of structure–function hypotheses, some {{for the first}} time, within a single genus to minimize phylogenetic ‘noise’ and maximize detection of functionally relevant variation. • This integrative study combined in-depth anatomical observations using light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy of seven Acer taxa, and compared these observations with empirical measures of xylem hydraulics. • Our results reveal a 2 MPa range in species’ mean cavitation pressure (MCP). MCP was strongly correlated with <b>intervessel</b> pit structure (membrane thickness and porosity, chamber depth), weakly correlated with pit number per vessel, and not related to pit area per vessel. At the tissue level, {{there was a strong}} correlation between MCP and mechanical strength parameters, and some of the first evidence is provided for the functional significance of vessel grouping and thickenings on inner vessel walls. In addition, a strong trade-off was observed between xylemspecific conductivity and MCP. Vessel length and <b>intervessel</b> wall characteristics were implicated in this safety–efficiency trade-off. • Cavitation resistance and hydraulic conductivity in Acer appear to be controlled by a very complex interaction between tissue, vessel network and pit characteristics. † Methods Observations of wood anatomy of 21 woody Spermacoceae and eight woody Knoxieae species, most of them included in a multi-gene molecular phylogeny, are carried out using light microscopy. † Key Results Observations of wood anatomy in Spermacoceae support the molecular hypothesis that all the woody species examined are secondary derived. Well-known wood anatomical characters that demonstrate this shift from the herbaceous to the woody habit are the typically flat or decreasing length vs. age curves for vessel elements, the abundance of square and upright ray cells, or even the (near-) absence of rays. These socalled paedomorphic wood features are also present in the Knoxieae genera Otiophora, Otomeria, Pentas, Pentanisia and Phyllopentas. However, the wood structure of the other Knoxieae genera observed (Carphalea, Dirichletia and Triainolepis) is typical of primarily woody taxa. † Conclusions In Spermacoceae, secondary woodiness has evolved numerous times in strikingly different habitats. In Knoxieae, there is a general trend from primary woodiness towards herbaceousness and back to (secondary) woodiness...|$|E
40|$|Tumour pH plays a {{significant}} role in cancer treatment. However, because of the limitations of the current measurement techniques, spatially and temporally resolved pH data, obtained non-invasively in solid tumours, are not available. Fluorescence ratio imaging microscopy (FRIM) has been used previously for noninvasive, dynamic evaluation of pH in neoplastic tissue in vivo (Martin GR, Jain RK 1994, Cancer Res., 54, 5670 - 5674). However, owing to problems associated with quantitative fluorescence in thick biological tissues, these studies were limited to thin (50 microns) tumours. We, therefore, adapted the FRIM technique for pH determination in thick (approximately 2 mm) solid tumours in vivo using a pinhole illumination-optical sectioning (PIOS) method. Results show that (1) steep interstitial pH gradients (5 microns resolution), with different spatial patterns, exist between tumour blood vessels; (2) pH decreased by an average of 0. 10 pH units over a distance of 40 microns away from the blood vessel wall, and by 0. 33 pH units over a 70 microns distance; (3) the maximum pH drop, defined as the pH difference between the <b>intervessel</b> midpoint and the vessel wall, was positively correlated with the <b>intervessel</b> distance; (4) 45 min following a systemic glucose injection (6 g kg- 1 i. v), interstitial pH gradients were shifted to lower pH values by an average of 0. 15 pH units, while the spatial gradient (slope) was maintained, when compared with preglucose values. This pH decrease was not accompanied by significant changes in local blood flow. pH gradients returned to near-baseline values 90 min after glucose injection; (5) interstitial tumour pH before hyperglycaemia and the glucose-induced pH drop strongly depended on the local vessel density; and (6) sodium bicarbonate treatment, either acute (1 M, 0. 119 ml h- 1 for 3 h i. v.) or chronic (1 % in drinking water for 8 days), did not significantly change interstitial tumour pH. Modified FRIM may be combined with other optical methods (e. g. phosphorescence quenching) to evaluate non-invasively the spatial and temporal characteristics of extracellular pH, intracellular pH and pO 2 in solid tumours. This will offer unique information about tumour metabolism and its modification by treatment modalities used in different cancer therapies...|$|E
40|$|<b>Intervessel</b> pits are {{structures}} that {{play a key}} role in the efficiency and safety functions of xylem hydraulics. However, little is known about the components of the pit membrane (PM) and their role in hydraulic functions, especially in resistance to cavitation. We tested the effect of commercial chemicals including a cellulase, a hemicellulase, a pectolyase, a proteinase and DTT on xylem hydraulic properties: vulnerability to cavitation (VC) and conductance. The effects were tested on branch segments from Fagus sylvatica (where the effects on pit structure were analyzed using TEM) and Populus tremula. Cellulose hydrolysis resulted in a sharp increase in VC and a significant increase in conductance, related to complete breakdown of the PM. Pectin hydrolysis also induced a sharp increase in VC but with no effect on conductance or pit structure observable by TEM. The other treatments with hemicellulase, proteinase or DTT showed no effect. This study brings evidence that cellulose and pectins are critical components underpinning VC, and that PM components may play distinct roles in the xylem hydraulic safety and efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of vestured pits in angiosperms is briefly reviewed. In some major clades, {{the character is}} of constant occurrence and thus very conservative; in others, it is more variable and apparently subject to both parallel origins and reversible losses. There is a striking correlation between the type of vessel perforation plate and vestured pits. Virtually all taxa with vestured pits have simple perforation plates. This correlation, together with contrasting ecological trends for scalariform perforation plates and vestured pits, has inspired functional hypotheses that vestured pits contribute to hydraulic safety. Whereas scalariform perforations may be instrumental in reducing the effects of freezing-induced embolisms in temperate to boreal and alpine regions, vestured pits {{seem to be a}} good candidate to facilitate embolism reversal in xeric and warmer regions with high transpiration rates. The presence of highly lignified structures within the pit chamber may influence hydraulic resistance, decrease vulnerability to cavitation, or help to repair embolism by compartmentalizing or affecting the contact angle of the convex air-water interface within <b>intervessel</b> pits. status: publishe...|$|E
