Men usually have their hair in a top knot, although nowadays they are usually wigs, and some may wear fancy hats. They parade through the streets playing various instruments, including both traditional Japanese instruments and western instruments. Usually, one person carries a combined instrument consisting of a small gong (giving the chin sound in chindon'ya) and two small drums (giving the don sound in cindonya). Additional instruments by other performers may include a larger drum and a woodwind instrument, as for example a clarinet, a trumpet or a saxophone.

25|$|The {{cities of}} Ionia worshipped the Spartan general Lysander, when he {{personally}} dominated Greece, {{immediately following the}} Peloponnesian War; according to Plutarch, {{this was the first}} instance of ruler cult in Greek history. There were similar instances of divine cult to humans in the same century, although some rulers, like Agesilaus, declined it. Clearchus, tyrant of Heraclea, <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>like</b> Zeus and claimed godhood; this did not stop the Heracleots from assassinating him. Isocrates said of Philip II of Macedon that after he conquered the Persian Empire, there would be nothing for him to attain but to become a god; the city of Amphipolis, and a private society at Athens, worshiped him even without this conquest; he himself set out his statue, dressed as a god, as the thirteenth of the Twelve Olympians.|$|E

500|$|In January 2014, Havas Worldwide and the Turkish {{branch of}} the condom company Durex created a {{television}} commercial titled [...] "Farewell Elizabeth" [...] that parodied Oobi. It featured a man breaking up with his girlfriend and resorting to dating his right hand, which was <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>like</b> {{one of the characters}} from the series. The Oobi hand puppet (named [...] "Elizabeth") was intended to be a metaphor for masturbation, which is generally regarded as a taboo subject in the country. The company had produced other anti-masturbation advertisements in the past, all of which were unsuccessful in Turkey. Havas Worldwide stated in an interview with La República that they chose to parody Oobi after deciding that doing [...] "something never said or done" [...] before would {{be the only way to}} make such a commercial popular with Turkish viewers.|$|E

The song ends with the narrator turning inward with the lyrics: [...] "And in my best behavior, I am really just like him / Look beneath the floorboards for the secrets I have hid."

500|$|E! Online's Jenna Mullins {{thought the}} body-swap {{sequence}} [...] "breathed fresh 'n' crazy air into Glee", and Kubicek called it [...] "the best thing Glee {{has ever done}} and will ever do". Jyll Saskin of MTV said it was [...] "super trippy, makes no sense plot-wise" [...] and was a [...] "totally awesome Glee moment"; Entertainment Weekly Erin Strecker wrote that [...] "the entire cast deserved an MVP award for their completely on-point mannerisms", and singled out [...] "Finn and Puck all snuggly together, holding hands and <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>like</b> Kurt and Blaine". VanDerWerff, however, {{described it as a}} [...] "totally odd curiosity that comes out of nowhere", and said that the car trip taken by Tina and Rachel later in the episode was more successful at showing Tina [...] "what Rachel's life is like". Kubicek called the offer of the trip and subsequent drive a [...] "sweet bonding moment" [...] between the pair, and called it [...] "great" [...] that [...] "Tina is the one who saves the day" [...] at the meeting with Carmen, but Chaney wondered why it took Rachel two episodes to regain her drive and aspirations.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for Fall Out Boy's [...] "Beat It" [...] was {{directed}} by Shane Drake and was made in homage to Jackson. [...] "I think when you're doing a Michael Jackson cover, there's this expectation that you're going to do one of his videos verbatim," [...] Stump said. [...] "What {{we decided to do}} was kind of inspired by Michael Jackson and the mythology of him. There are specific images that are reference points for us, but at any given point, it's not any of his videos. It's kind of all of his videos, all at once, but on a Fall Out Boy budget, so it's not quite as fancy." [...] The costumes for the video were similar to the originals. [...] "My costume is this take on one of the guys from Michael Jackson's original 'Beat It' video, like, the guy who plays the rival dancer," [...] Wentz said during the filming of the video. The music video featured numerous cameos, including a karate class/dance session being taught by Tony Hale, Donald Faison and Joel David Moore <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>like</b> Michael Jackson.

2500|$|Men often wear brothel creepers or Dr. Martens {{boots and}} shave their heads into high {{wedge-shaped}} pompadours or quiffs, military-style crops, or mohawks.

The Shark's song said: [...] "When your Mom says you look really nice / When you're <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>like</b> a Ted / It's time to follow this cat's advice / Take a razor to your head".

2500|$|The {{recording}} {{process for}} California was {{more complex than}} for the band's previous records. They chose to record the disc to analog tape rather than digitally and some songs required several 24-track machines, utilizing over 50 tracks. As a result, each song contains layers of original samples, keyboards, percussion and melodies. The album displays influences from Burt Bacharach and The Beach Boys, while blending lounge, pop, jazz, funk, thrash metal, Hawaiian, Middle Eastern, kecak and avant-garde music. The band toured North America, Australia and Europe to support the record. They also notably appeared on the 2000 edition of the SnoCore Tour, performing alongside alternative metal acts whom they had influenced, such as Incubus and System of a Down. According to Trevor Dunn, Mr. Bungle were [...] "completely out of place" [...] on the SnoCore Tour.

After the war, a friend showed Hathcock a passage written by Ernest Hemingway: [...] "Certainly there is no hunting like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and like it, never really care for anything else thereafter." [...] He copied Hemingway's words on a piece of paper. [...] "He got that right," [...] Hathcock said. [...] "It was the hunt, not the killing." [...] Hathcock said in a book written about his career as a sniper: [...] "I like shooting, and I love hunting. But I never did enjoy killing anybody. It's my job.
