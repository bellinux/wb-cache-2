5|$|A four-part series {{published}} between January and April 1996, {{the story}} begins with the New York Police Department using Brock's wife, Ann, to trap him. Brock sends the symbiote to Ann, turning her into She-Venom again and letting her escape. In issue #3, Ann is afraid of the symbiote's influence and refuses to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with Brock while he wears it. This plotline is resolved in The Amazing Spider-Man Vol.2 #19 (2000), in which Ann's experience with the symbiote triggers her suicide. The story includes contemporary Spider-Man Ben Reilly trying to bring Venom to justice.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte {{restored}} Lafayette's citizenship on 1 March 1800, and he {{was able}} to recover some of his properties. The ruler offered to make Lafayette minister to the United States, but was met with a firm refusal, as Lafayette would not <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with Napoleon's government. In 1802, Lafayette was part of the tiny minority that voted no in the referendum that made Bonaparte consul for life. Bonaparte offered to appoint Lafayette to the Senate and to bestow the Legion of Honor upon him, but Lafayette declined, though he stated he would gladly have taken the honors from a democratic government.|$|E
5|$|Epaminondas was {{considered}} the greatest warrior-statesmen of ancient Thebes by many, including the Roman historian Diodorus Siculus. Diodorus does not <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say about the sexual orientation of Epaminondas or the Sacred Band, nor does he {{say anything about the}} following account, again from Plutarch (Amatorius 17). According to Plutarch's dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus, the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle. They were buried together, something usually reserved for a husband and wife in Greek society.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} addax is Addax nasomaculatus. This antelope was first described by French zoologist and anatomist Henri Blainville in 1816. It {{is placed in the}} monotypic genus Addax and family Bovidae. Henri Blainville observed syntypes in Bullock's Pantherion and the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. English naturalist Richard Lydekker stated their type locality to be probably Senegambia, though he did not <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> support the claim. Finally, from a discussion in 1898, it became more probable that British hunters or collectors obtained the addax from the part of Sahara in Tunisia.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} awaiting Mary Godwin in England was {{fraught with}} complications, {{some of which}} she had not foreseen. Either before or during the journey, she had become pregnant. She and Percy now found themselves penniless, and, to Mary's genuine surprise, her father refused to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with her. The couple moved with Claire into lodgings at Somers Town, and later, Nelson Square. They maintained their intense programme of reading and writing, and entertained Percy Shelley's friends, such as Thomas Jefferson Hogg and the writer Thomas Love Peacock. Percy Shelley sometimes left home for short periods to dodge creditors. The couple's distraught letters reveal their pain at these separations.|$|E
5|$|When Marge {{takes the}} family to the Family Fun Center, she notices Nelson acting like a bully, {{especially}} when he knocks Milhouse off the track and wins a BB gun from stolen prize tickets. Bart and Nelson attempt to be friends, but Marge forbids Bart {{to hang out with}} Nelson. Bart goes to Nelson’s house anyway and starts using Nelson's new BB gun. When Nelson pressures Bart to shoot a bird in a nest, Bart accidentally kills the bird. Marge is furious that Bart killed an animal, but instead of punishing him, she refuses to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with his destructive ways.|$|E

Angela is allowed her choice of one as a present to her when they {{are old enough to}} leave their mother & she chooses Little Lad. However, Jackson White (Jack Daly), a poacher Lad fought and chased off the {{property}} before, sets fire to barn out of vengeance. Elizabeth is injured and Little Lad is killed but not Wolf. Lad later aids in capturing White when he breaks into the house to try to steal Lad's gold trophy from the dog show. Angela is initially inconsolable over the loss of her puppy Little Lad, and refuses to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with Wolf. After he is nearly lost in another accident, she changes her mind and accepts Wolf as her new dog.|$|E
5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with Herodotus.|$|E

25|$|This didn't <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do {{with the}} theater, because they never worked together. Rather, they both had a love of prize {{fighting}} and {{used to go to}} boxing matches together, engaging in jocose discussion of the relative merits of Negro with Jewish pugilists. They would occasionally wager a bottle of whisky on these bouts.|$|E
25|$|Welland's {{original}} script also featured, {{in addition}} to Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams, a third protagonist, 1924 Olympic gold medallist Douglas Lowe, who was presented as a privileged aristocratic athlete. However, Lowe refused to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the film, and his character was written out and replaced by the fictional character of Lord Andrew Lindsay.|$|E

In 1916, he was thrown from a horse and suffered a broken jaw and a serious head injury; he received a mandatory discharge, and returned to writing.|$|E
25|$|According to the Pāli Canon & Āgama (the Early Buddhist scriptures), {{there is}} no any saying that same or {{opposite}} gender relations <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with sexual misconduct, and some Theravada monks express that same-gender relations do not violate the rule to avoid sexual misconduct, which means not having sex with someone under age (thus protected by their parents or guardians), someone betrothed or married and who have taken vows of religious celibacy.|$|E

After Anne accidentally gets Diana drunk, Mrs. Barry rejects the girl, forbidding Diana to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with Anne. This sanction is repealed after Anne saves Minnie May.|$|E

A young Japanese woman visits Burma {{to find her}} half-brother, the child of her father, {{an officer in the}} Japanese army, and a Burmese mother. Her half-brother initially refuses to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with her because he believes that his father raped his mother. A joint production with the Japanese turned this novel into a film which had its 2003 premiere in Japan.|$|E
25|$|Both {{in common}} law and in civil law, a rebuttable {{presumption}} (in Latin, praesumptio iuris tantum) is an assumption {{made by a}} court, one that is taken to be true unless someone comes forward to contest it and prove otherwise. For example, a defendant {{in a criminal case}} is presumed innocent until proved guilty. According to law, in an International child abduction the left behind parent is legally the only victim, if the child is not returned before child custody ends at age 18. This is because child custody does not <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with children’s rights or welfare only parental rights.|$|E
25|$|Cockburn {{commanded}} {{a squadron of}} warships for the landings in Walcheren in July 1809 during the Walcheren Campaign. He took command of the third-rate HMS Implacable {{off the coast of}} Spain in January 1810 and sailed to Quiberon Bay with a small squadron whose mission was to arrange the escape of the King of Spain, whom the French had imprisoned at the Château de Valençay. The mission failed when Ferdinand refused to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the British. Cockburn was promoted to commodore, hoisting his broad pennant in the fourth-rate HMS Grampus in November 1811.|$|E
