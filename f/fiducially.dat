Sandflies {{were collected from}} human habitations. Tests revealed that this species was sensitive to DDT. Results from data analysis showed that LT 50 and LT 90 can be measured as 30 (<b>fiducially</b> limit; 23, 36) and 55 minutes (<b>fiducially</b> limit: 44, 84), respectively. The mortality rate at the diagnostic dose of DDT with an exposure time of one hour followed by 24 hour recovery period exhibited 97 ± 2 % mortality...|$|E
40|$|We propose {{critical}} considerations on {{the usefulness}} of CT, MRI, and fMRI imaging fusion {{for the treatment of}} skull base lesions evaluating 41 cases (24 meningiomas: six petroclival, seven clinoidal, four olfactory, two in the foramen magnum, two spheno-petro-clival, one in the planum sphenoidale, one in the posterior pyramid and one in the PCA; five acoustic schwannomas, three epidermoids, two pituitary adenomas, two craniopharingiomas, two posterior fossa aneurysms, one trigeminal schwannoma, one dermoid and one juvenile angiofibroma). Data were collected, fused, integrated and reconstructed by a dedicated Stealth-Station system for Neuronavigation. CT images were acquired on axial non-overlapping slices, 1 - 3 mm thick; MRI images were obtained with a 1. 5 T system, same FOV and thickness. During surgery the Mean <b>Fiducially</b> Error measured at 6 cm depth and anatomical distortion due to CSF loss was evaluated. Neuronavigation was possible in all cases and successfully applied in preoperative planning and during surgical procedures. The Mean <b>Fiducially</b> Error at 6 cm was 1. 7 mm. CSF loss during surgery produced modifications on planned anatomy in a mean value of 0. 6 mm. In all cases, imaging fusion for pre and intra-operative neuronavigation provided great advantages in the choice of the best approach, placing of bone flap, correct definition of tumour boundaries and meningeal implant, relationship with functional areas, early identification and real-time correction of the surgical route with respect of deep normal or distorted anatomic or pathologic structures and their eventual encasement or involvement by the pathologic primary process. Neuronavigation appeared ideal for skull base meningiomas making surgical manoeuvres safer, more effective and less invasive. In skull base lesions, CSF loss appeared not significant {{due to the fact that}} posterior fossa structures are strictly connected to each other and to the bone, thus are poorly affected by surgical deliquoration. We propose the possible extension of imaging fusion technique with the aim of optimizing the target in radiotherapy for intracranial tumours...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{inspiration}} of F. A. Hayek's book "Denationalisation of Money" {{and a book}} "What Has Government Done to Our Money" written by Murray N. Rothbard, this work wants to show how can a market with several currencies work. These authors from Austrian school introduce little controversial and for many people unimaginable theme to have banking system without the key role of Central Bank. This also closely related with Hayek's reason of business cycle, which he find in continuous interference with monetary reserves. The work controverts a topic, {{if it is not}} just the central banks and a system, which allows <b>fiducially</b> issue money, which caused the actual crises. The point, if a monetary policy of central banks has only caused fluctuations of economy, is still actually. This baccalaurean work deals with questions like: How did the Government interfere with sphere of money? Should we leave the Gold Standard? Would a competition between banks issuing their own currencies work? and many other...|$|E
40|$|Final {{published}} version. Accepted {{for publication}} in Phys. Rev. DInternational audienceIn order to improve the phasing of the comparable-mass waveform {{as we approach the}} last stable orbit for a system, various resummation methods have been used to improve the standard post-Newtonian waveforms. In this work we present a new family of templates for the detection of gravitational waves from the inspiral of two comparable-mass black hole binaries. These new adiabatic templates are based on reexpressing the derivative of the binding energy and the gravitational wave flux functions in terms of shifted Chebyshev polynomials. The Chebyshev polynomials are a useful tool in numerical methods as they display the fastest convergence of any of the orthogonal polynomials. In this case they are also particularly useful as they eliminate one of the features that plagues the post-Newtonian expansion. The Chebyshev binding energy now has information at all post-Newtonian orders, compared to the post-Newtonian templates which only have information at full integer orders. In this work, we compare both the post-Newtonian and Chebyshev templates against a <b>fiducially</b> exact waveform. This waveform is constructed from a hybrid method of using the test-mass results combined with the mass dependent parts of the post-Newtonian expansions for the binding energy and flux functions. Our results show that the Chebyshev templates achieve extremely high fitting factors at all post-Newtonian orders and provide excellent parameter extraction. We also show that this new template family has a faster Cauchy convergence, gives a better prediction of the position of the last stable orbit and in general recovers higher Signal-to-Noise ratios than the post-Newtonian templates...|$|E

40|$|Thomas Palley {{argues that}} {{the causes of the}} “Great Recession” are not {{primarily}} {{to be found in the}} asset bubble that was allowed to inflate in the housing market and in the financial sector. The bubbles actually reflect the longer-term basis for stagnation that originate in the macro-economic structure of the US. He presents two major dimensions of these structural problems. The first problem is the entrenchment of a “neoliberal” growth model that is hegemonic in the minds of politicians and the economics establishment that became orthodoxy in the 1980 s. He then considers the second obstacle to creating a virtuous circle of demand and full employment. Secondly, Palley finds that the US model of economic engagement with the world’s other economies is flawed. He ends his presentation with an alternative policy recommendation that inverts the power of corporations in favor of workers. Crisis is an inherent, inevitable, feature of capitalism in the findings of Anwar Shaikh. He demonstrates this historically by outlining its recurrence from at least two centuries of experience. Moreover, the crises are not limited to just one nation but are system-wide events. The current recession rises out of the generalized leveling off of the profit rate in the early 1980 s that was achieved by driving down wages but increasing productivity. Moreover, the cost of capital has been historically low and, thus, particularly important for fueling financial bubbles. He concludes that there is little reason to believe that wages might be able to return to a greater balance with productivity growth given the power of capitalists and the growing army of reserve labor. Jeff Marick trains his lens on the corruption of Wall Street and the lack of governmental regulation of the financial sector as the two most important causes of the Great Recession. The incentives for Wall Street were at odds with a self-sustaining economy. Short-term gains, huge bonuses and gaming the sector were given priority over <b>fiducially</b> prudent decisions for the long-term health of financial institutions and the economy as a whole. These incentives grew out of deregulation beginning with the Reagan administration, a lack of micro-economic analysis stemming from a Grenspanian ideology of banker probity, and mass delusion that economy would continue to churn along. Madrick points to recurrent market failures from the fall of junk bond kings, to the Savings and Loans collapses, to recurrent crisis in the 1990 s and the blowout of the high-tech bubble at the century’s turn. Despite these warnings, the government refused to be diligent and allowed for ever-greater financial chicanery to be built with the goal of enriching corporate executives at the expense of the rest of the economy...|$|E
40|$|With the industry's recent {{paradigm}} shift from PC-centred applications to services delivered through ubiquitous computing {{in a more}} human centred manner, multimodal human-computer interfaces (MHCI) became an emerging research topic. As an important but often neglected aspect, the lack of appropriate system integration tools hinders the development of MHCI systems. Therefore, the work presented in this thesis aims at delivering hardware / software infrastructure to facilitate the full development cycle of MHCI systems. Specifically, we first built a hardware platform for synchronised, multimodal-data capturing to support and facilitate automatic human behaviour understanding from multiple audiovisual sensors. Then we developed a software framework, called the HCI^ 2 Framework, to facilitate the modular development and rapid prototyping of readily-applicable MHCI systems. As a proof of concept, we also present an affect-sensitive game with humanoid robot NAO developed using the HCI^ 2 Framework. Studies on automatic human behaviour understanding require high-bandwidth recording from multiple cameras, {{as well as from}} other sensors such as microphones and eye-gaze trackers. In addition, sensor fusion should be realised with high accuracy as to achieve tight synchronisation between sensors and, in turn, enable studies of correlation between various behavioural signals. Using commercial off-the-shelf components may compromise quality and accuracy due to several issues including handling the combined data rate from multiple sensors, unknown offset and rate discrepancies between independent hardware clocks, the absence of trigger inputs or -outputs in the hardware, as well as the existence of different methods for time-stamping the recorded data. To achieve accurate synchronisation, we centralise the synchronisation task by recording all trigger or timestamp signals with a multi-channel audio interface. For sensors not having an external trigger signal, we let the computer that captures the sensor data periodically generate timestamp signals from its serial port output. These signals can also be used as a common time base to synchronise multiple asynchronous audio interfaces. The resulted data recording platform, which is built upon two consumer-grade PCs, is capable of capturing 8 -bit video data with 1024 × 1024 spatial- and 59. 1 Hz temporal resolution, from at least 14 cameras, together with 8 channels of 24 -bit audio at 96 kHz and eye-gaze tracking result sampled at a frequency of 60 or 120 Hz. The attained synchronisation accuracy is unprecedented up to date. To facilitate rapid development of readily-applicable MHCI systems using algorithms designed to detect and track behavioural signals (e. g. face detector, facial <b>fiducially</b> points tracker, expression recogniser, etc.), a software integration framework is required. The proposed software framework, which is called the HCI^ 2 Framework, is built upon publish / subscribe (P/S) architecture. It implements a shared-memory-based data transport protocol for message delivery and a TCP-based system management protocol. The latter ensures that the integrity of system structure is maintained at runtime. With the inclusion of ‘bridging modules’, the HCI^ 2 Framework is interoperable with other software frameworks including Psyclone and ActiveMQ. In addition to the core communication middleware, we also present the integrated development environment (IDE) of the HCI^ 2 Framework. It provides a complete graphical environment to support every step in a typical MHCI system development process, including module development, debugging, packaging, and management, as well as the whole system management and testing. The quantitative evaluation indicates that our framework outperforms other similar tools in terms of average message latency and maximum data throughput under a typical single PC scenario. To demonstrate HCI^ 2 Framework’s capabilities in integrating heterogeneous modules, we present several example modules working with a variety of hardware and software. We also present two use cases of the HCI^ 2 Framework: a computer game, called CamGame, based on hand-held marker(s) and low-cost camera(s) and the human affective signal analysis component of the Fun Robotic Outdoor Guide (FROG) project ([URL] Using the HCI^ 2 Framework, we further developed the Mimic-Me Game, which consists of an interactive game played with the NAO humanoid robot. The game involves the robot ‘mimicking’ the player’s facial expression using a combination of body gestures and audio cues. A multimodal dialogue model has been designed and implemented to enable the robot to interact with the human player in a naturalistic way using only natural language, head movement and facial expressions.
