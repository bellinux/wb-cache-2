40|$|Based on {{a reduced}} two-compartment model, the {{dynamical}} and biophysical mechanism underlying the spike initiation of the neuron to extracellular electric fields is investigated in this paper. With stability and phase plane analysis, we first investigate {{in detail the}} dynamical properties of neuronal spike initiation induced by <b>geometric</b> <b>parameter</b> and internal coupling conductance. The <b>geometric</b> <b>parameter</b> is the ratio between soma area and total membrane area, which describes the proportion of area occupied by somatic chamber. It is found that varying it could qualitatively alter the bifurcation structures of equilibrium as well as neuronal phase portraits, which remain unchanged when varying internal coupling conductance. By analyzing the activating properties of somatic membrane currents at subthreshold potentials, we explore the relevant biophysical basis of spike initiation dynamics induced by these two parameters. It is observed that increasing <b>geometric</b> <b>parameter</b> could greatly decrease {{the intensity of the}} internal current flowing from soma to dendrite, which switches spike initiation dynamics from Hopf bifurcation to SNIC bifurcation; increasing internal coupling conductance could lead to the increase of this outward internal current, whereas the increasing range is so small that it could not qualitatively alter the spike initiation dynamics. These results highlight that neuronal <b>geometric</b> <b>parameter</b> is a crucial factor in determining the spike initiation dynamics to electric fields. The finding is useful to interpret the functional significance of neuronal biophysical properties in their encoding dynamics, which could contribute to uncovering how neuron encode...|$|R

The objective {{of this paper is to}} analyze the main <b>geometric</b> <b>parameter</b> which affects rolling stiffness of Anti-Roll bar. By the optimization of <b>geometric</b> <b>parameter,</b> we can increase the rolling stiffness and reduce the mass of the bar. Changes in design of anti-roll bars are quite common at various steps of vehicle production and a design analysis must be performed for each change. To calculate rolling stiffness, mass, deflection, Von-mises stresses Ansys Parametric Design language (APDL) is used. The effects of anti-roll bar design parameters on final anti-roll bar properties are also evaluated by performing sample analyses with the FEA program developed in this paper...|$|R
