50|$|Die {{making is}} a subgenre of tool making {{that focuses on}} making and {{maintaining}} dies. This often includes making punches, dies, steel rule <b>dies,</b> and <b>die</b> <b>sets.</b> Precision is key in die making; punches and dies must maintain proper clearance to produce parts accurately, and it is often necessary to have <b>die</b> <b>sets</b> machined with tolerances of less than one thousandth of an inch.|$|R

Most two-die set includes a bullet seating die and either a full length resizing die or a neck sizing die. A full length sizing die reforms the complete body of the case to specification. The neck sizing die reforms only the neck {{so that it can}} hold the bullet in place. Neck-sizing cases rather than full length sizing cases can extend the case life of cartridges. On the downside, cases that are only neck sized may not feed through some actions reliably especially when used in semi-automatic rifles. Cartridges which are intended for semi-automatics should be full length resized. Most Weatherby manufactured rifle chambers are machined to very tight tolerances making [...] full length resizing has little effect on extending the case life as the cartridge brass {{does not have to be}} worked as much to reform it. If once fired cases are to be used in a rifle in other than one it which it had been previously fired full length resizing the cases is the norm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Die {{casting process}} has been used widely for complex {{automotive}} products such as the knuckle, arm and etc. Generally, a part fabricated by casting has limited strength due to manufacturing defects by origin such as the dendrite structure and segregation. As an attempt to offer a solution to these problems, forging {{has been used as}} an alternative process. However, the forging process provides limited formability for complex shape products. Rheo-forging of metal offers not only superior mechanical strength but also requires significantly lower machine loads than solid forming processes. In order to produce semi-solid materials of the desired microstructure, a stirring process is applied during solidification of molten state. This paper presents the results of an A 356 aluminum alloy sample, which were obtained by experiment and by simulation using DEFORM 3 D. Samples of metal parts were subsequently fabricated by using hydraulic press machinery. In order to compare the influence of loading method, two types of samples were fabricated: (1) samples fabricated under direct loading <b>die</b> <b>sets</b> (2) those fabricated under indirect loading <b>die</b> <b>sets.</b> The formability and defects, which were predicted by FEM simulation, were similar to those of samples used in practice...|$|R
