25|$|Liberal arts {{colleges are}} <b>four-year</b> <b>institutions</b> that {{emphasize}} interactive instruction, although research {{is still a}} component of these institutions. They are usually residential colleges with most students living on campus in dorms. They tend to have smaller enrollments, class sizes, and lower student-teacher ratios than universities, and encourage teacher-student interaction with classes taught by full-time faculty members rather than graduate students known as teaching assistants. There are further distinctions within the category of liberal arts colleges: some are coeducational, women's colleges, or men's colleges. There are historically black colleges; in addition, while most schools are secular, some stress a particular religious orientation. Most are private colleges {{but there are some}} public ones.|$|E
25|$|Political {{ideology}} is {{not found to}} be correlated with social class; however, a statistical relationship is seen between the level of one's educational attainment one's likelihood of subscribing to a particular political ideology. In terms of income, liberals tend to be tied with pro-business conservatives. Most mass affluent households tend to be more right-leaning on fiscal issues but more left-leaning on social issues. The majority, between 50% and 60%, of households with incomes above $50,000 overall, not all of whom are upper middle class, supported the Republican Party in the 2000, 2004, and 2006 elections. Nevertheless, those with postgraduate degrees overall statistically favour the Democratic Party.

2500|$|While most {{college admissions}} {{involves}} {{high school students}} applying to colleges, transfer admissions are important as well. Estimates {{of the percentage of}} college students who transfer vary from 20% to 33% to 60%, with the consensus position being around a third of college students transfer, and there are many indications that transfer activity is increasing. One report suggested that nearly half of all undergraduates in the nation were attending community colleges. Media coverage of student transfers is generally less than coverage of the high school to college transition. A common transfer path is students moving from two-year community colleges to <b>four-year</b> <b>institutions,</b> although there is considerable movement between <b>four-year</b> <b>institutions.</b> Reasons for transferring include unhappiness with campus life, cost, and course and degree selection. There are no consistent national rules for transfers, and requirements vary by college. Many community colleges have articulation agreements with four-year schools, particularly flagship state universities, so that matters such as the transfers of credits are handled appropriately. There are indications that many private colleges are more actively seeking transfer applicants. Still, transferring can be difficult; transfer students have been described in the past as [...] "academic nomads".|$|E
40|$|There is a {{significant}} degree of controversy surrounding the transfer mission of community colleges. Specifically, many researchers have suggested that these institutions divert the educational attainments, and thus social mobility, of disadvantaged groups (Brint 2 ̆ 6 Karabel, 1989; Dougherty, 1987, 1992, 1994; Karabel, 1972). Others suggest that community colleges provide disadvantaged individuals, who would have otherwise failed to consider a postsecondary education, with a viable path by which to attain a four-year degree (Cohen 2 ̆ 6 Brawer, 1996; Hilmer, 1997; Pascarella 2 ̆ 6 Terenzini, 2005). This study sought {{to determine whether the}} path to social mobility, via educational attainment, differed for bachelor 2 ̆ 7 s degree aspirants who commenced their postsecondary education at a community college, versus a <b>four-year</b> <b>institution,</b> in terms of enrollment outcomes three-years later (i. e., at a <b>four-year</b> <b>institution,</b> a selective or highly-selective <b>four-year</b> <b>institution,</b> and/or a privately-controlled <b>four-year</b> <b>institution).</b> Specifically, hierarchical logistic regression analyses were used to determine whether the effect of initial enrollment location on the odds of year-four enrollment outcomes depended on student characteristics (i. e., race/ethnicity, generational status, family income, prior academic achievements, and/or psychosocial factors) among a large representative sample of students who started their postsecondary education at either a community college or a <b>four-year</b> <b>institution</b> in the fall semester of 2003. Results suggest that student characteristics do not detrimentally modify the effect of initial community college enrollment on students 2 ̆ 7 odds of later enrollment outcomes. In addition, the results suggest that after accounting for the effects of initial enrollment location and other predictors, the effect of standardized test scores appears to significantly increase the odds of being enrolled at a selective or highly selective <b>four-year</b> <b>institution</b> for students who initially matriculated to a community college rather than a <b>four-year</b> <b>institution.</b> The findings are discussed in terms of implications for consumers of higher education, vocational psychologists, as well as postsecondary institutions and educational policy...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Four-year</b> <b>institutions</b> in the U.S. that {{emphasize}} {{a liberal arts}} curriculum are known as liberal arts colleges. Until the 20th century, liberal arts, law, medicine, theology, and divinity were about the only form of higher education available in the United States. These schools have traditionally emphasized instruction at the undergraduate level, although advanced research may still occur at these institutions.While there is no national standard in the United States, the term [...] "university" [...] primarily designates institutions that provide undergraduate and graduate education. A university typically has as its core and its largest internal division an undergraduate college teaching a liberal arts curriculum, also culminating in a bachelor's degree. What often distinguishes a university is having, in addition, one or more graduate schools engaged in both teaching graduate classes and in research. Often these would be called a School of Law or School of Medicine, (but may also be called a college of law, or a faculty of law). An exception is Vincennes University, Indiana, which is styled and chartered as a [...] "university" [...] even though almost all of its academic programs lead only to two-year associate degrees. Some institutions, such as Dartmouth College and The College of William & Mary, have retained the term [...] "college" [...] in their names for historical reasons. In one unique case, Boston College and Boston University, both located in Boston, Massachusetts, are completely separate institutions.Usage of the terms varies among the states. In 1996 for example, Georgia changed all of its <b>four-year</b> <b>institutions</b> previously designated as colleges to universities, {{and all of its}} vocational technology schools to technical colleges.|$|E
