40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the systemic fungicides in the sixties, the phenomenon of resistance to these compounds has become a serious problem in the control of fungal plant diseases. The aim {{of this study was to}} contribute to the knowledge about the consequences of fungicide applications in cereals with respect to the emergence of fungicide resistant strains of Septorianodorum, the causal agent of <b>glume</b> <b>blotch</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat,</b> and of Cercosporellaherpotrichoides, the causal agent of eyespot of wheat, barley and rye. CHAPTER 3. An accurate and reproducible inoculation method was used to inoculate wheat seedlings with spore suspensions of S. nodorum. The effect of postinfectional applications of the systemic fungicides carbendazim and edifenphos with respect to the development of symptoms and the length of the latent period was studied. Both fungicides suppressed the development of symptoms and elongated the duration of the latent period, the extent to which depending on the concentration of each fungicide used. CHAPTER 4. It is suggested that alternate or combined use of two systemic fungicides with a different mode of action can reduce the enrichment of specific resistant forms in a fungal population. To verify these statements, model experiments were carried out under controlled conditions. During 9 passages on living wheat plants, inoculated with spore suspensions of S. nodorum, the fungicides carbendazim and edifenphos were applied either alone or as a mixture in each passage, or applied alternately from passage to passage. After 9 passages, disease control by either fungicide alone was reduced. This tendency was not so pronounced in that variant where the fungicides were applied alternately and nearly absent in that variant where a mixture was applied. Comparable results were obtained in experiments on agar media. A stable edifenphos resistant strain was selected in that variant, where S. nodorum in each passage was cultured on plates with edifenphos. With C. herpotrichoides, experiments were carried out on agar media only, using carbendazim and nuarimol. Here, a strong effect of the alternate exposure of the fungus to these two compounds was present. since the fungus was hardly able to grow on plates with a moderate dosis of carbendazim, after first being cultured on plates with nuarimol. CHAPTER 5. The effect of field applications of thiophanate methyl and edifenphos on the frequency of resistant spores in field isolates of S. nodorum was examined, during five vegetation periods between 1973 and 1977. Two types of carbendazim resistant strains were present in S. nodorum. Weakly carbendazim resistant strains were inhibited at 5 μg/ml carbendazim in vitro and occured at a frequency of about 1 : 7 x 10 6 in populations from unsprayed plots. Highly carbendazim resistant strains occurred at a frequency of about 100 times that low and were hardly inhibited at 1000 μg/ml carbendazim in vitro. In each year, there was a significant increase in the frequency of weakly carbendazim resistant spores after thiophanate methyl applications in the field. but the absolute figures remained rather low. In no case, an isolate with more than 1 : 10 4 weakly resistant spores was found. There was no clear yearly increase in the frequency of highly carbendazim resistant spores after thiophanate methyl application. Edifenphos resistant spores were present in field isolates of S. nodorum. Their frequency- about 1 : 10 7 in isolates from unsprayed plots-, increased significantly after edifenphos application in the field, but the absolute figures remained rather low. During three years, field trials were carried out with C. herpotrichoides to examine the effect of carbendazim application in the field on the frequency of carbendazim resistant spores in field isolates. Their frequency in isolates from unsprayed plots was about 1 : 7 x 10 8 . This frequency increased after carbendazim applications, but mostly on an insignificant scale only. CHAPTER 6. Fungicide sensitive and resistant strains of S. nodorum were compared with respect to their mycelial growth rate, their sporulation capacity and their pathogenicity on agar medium and/or living wheat plants. Weakly carbendazim resistant strains showed a significantly faster mycelial growth on agar media with carbendazim, than sensitive ones, but were almost completely inhibited at 5 μg/ml carbendazim. This growth reduction was accompaniedby an increase in the number of spores, produced per mm 2 mycelium. Highly carbendazim resistant strains were able to grow and produce spores at 1000 μg/ml carbendazim in vitro. Resistant strians were present with a mycelial growth and spore production equal to that of sensitive ones. Pathogenicity tests with sensitive and highly carbendazim resistant strains on living wheat plants showed the same tendency, as far as the development of symptoms and sporeproduction is concerned. Edifenphos resistant strains of S. nodorum were compared with sensitive ones in tests on agar media and on wheat plants. Resistant strains were strongly inhibited at 200 μg/ml edifenphos in vitro. Edifenphos resistant strains were present with an equal fitness as sensitive ones, when grown in the absence of edifenphos, on agar media and on living wheat plants. The tests with C. herpotrichoides were performed with sensitive mother strains and the corresponding carbendazim. resistant daughter strains. These resistant strains were able to grow and produce spores even at 1000 μg/ml carbendazim in vitro. They produced more spores per mm 2 mycelium when cultured in the presence of carbendazim than in its absence. The properties of carbendazim resistant strains in vitro and in vivo did not differ very much from those of sensitive strains, in the absence of the fungicide. CHAPTER 7. The competitive ability of resistant strains was studied by inoculating wheat plants with different mixtures of resistant and sensitive spores. Carbendazim resistant strains of S. nodorum and C. herpotrichoides could maintain themselves in the mixed population for three passages on wheat plants, even in the absence of any fungicide selection pressure. In case of a postinfectional fungicide application, only carbendazim resistant strains could be reisolated. Edifenphos resistant strains disappeared from the respective populations in the absence of the fungicide, due to a smaller relative reproduction ratio...|$|E

The lowest level of infection was recorded in the year 2000 characterized by the lowest rainfall in this month.

A comparative analysis of Stagonospora nodorum wild-type and G alpha-defective mutant (gna 1) intracellular proteomes was performed via two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Several proteins showed significantly altered abundances when comparing the two strains. One such protein, the short-chain dehydrogenase Sch 1, was 18 -fold less abundant in the gna 1 strain, implying that it is positively regulated by G alpha signaling. Gene expression and transcriptional enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion analyses of Sch 1 indicates strong expression during asexual development. Mutant strains of Stagonospora nodorum lacking Sch 1 demonstrated poor growth on minimal media and exhibited a significant reduction in asexual sporulation on all growth media examined. Detailed histological experiments on sch 1 pycnidia revealed that the gene is required for the differentiation of the subparietal layers of asexual pycnidia resulting in a significant reduction in both pycnidiospore size and numbers...|$|R

40|$|The disease septoria leaf <b>blotch</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat,</b> {{caused by}} fungal {{pathogen}} Septoria tritici, is of worldwide concern. The fungus exhibits a hemibiotrophic lifestyle, {{with a long}} symptomless, biotrophic phase followed by a sudden transition to necrotrophy associated with host necrosis. Little {{is known about the}} systematic interaction between fungal pathogenicity and host responses at specific growth stages and the factors triggering the transition. In order to gain some insights into global transcriptome alterations in both host and pathogen during the two phases of the compatible interaction, disease transition was monitored using pathogenesis-related gene markers and H 2 O 2 signature prior to RNA-Seq. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the slow symptomless growth was accompanied by minor metabolic responses and slightly suppressed defences in the host, whereas necrotrophic growth was associated with enhanced host responses involving energy metabolism, transport, signalling, defence and oxidative stress as well as a decrease in photosynthesis. The fungus expresses distinct classes of stage-specific genes encoding potential effectors, probably first suppressing plant defence responses/facilitating the symptomless growth and later triggering life style transition and inducing host necrosis/facilitating the necrotrophic growth.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Malayamycin {{is a novel}} perhydrofuropyran C-nucleoside {{isolated}} from Streptomyces malaysiensis that shows promising antifungal activity, fully controlling a range of diseases when applied to plants at 100 μg mL - 1.

RESULTS: Malayamycin exhibited in vitro antifungal activity against Stagonospora nodorum (Berk) Castell & Germano, the cause <b>of</b> stagonospora nodorum <b>blotch</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat.</b> Growth in liquid minimum medium was merely delayed at 50 μg mL - 1, but sporulation was suppressed by more than 50 % by 10 μg mL- 1 of malayamycin. When applied to wheat seedlings 36 h prior to infection, 10 μg mL- 1 of malayamycin reduced lesion size and significantly reduced pycnidiation to only 5 % of the non-treated level. A transcription factor gene, Mrg 1 (malayamycin response gene) whose expression was upregulated by application of malayamycin, was identified. Both Mrg 1 knockout and overexpression strains were created. These strains were fully pathogenic, suggesting that the expression of Mrg 1 did not affect pathogenicity. Interestingly, a strain that expressed Mrg 1 50 times more than wild type showed a significant reduction in sporulation. However, all the tested knockout and overexpression strains retained sensitivity to malayamycin.

Cvs, Flame and Hereward, which have specific resistance to the isolate IPO 323, were crossed with the susceptible cv. Longbow. The results of tests on F 1 and F 2 progeny indicated that a single semidominant gene controls resistance to IPO 323 {{in each of the}} resistant cultivars. This was confirmed in F 3 families of Flame x Longbow, which were either homozygous resistant, homozygous susceptible, or segregating in tests with IPO 323 but were uniformly susceptible to another isolate, IPO 94269. None of 100 F 2 progeny of Flame x Hereward were susceptible to IPO 323, indicating that the resistance genes in these two cultivars are the same, closely linked, or allelic. The resistance gene in cv. Flame was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 3 A using microsatellite markers and was named Stb 6. Fifty-nine progeny of a cross between IPO 323 and IPO 94269 were used in complementary genetic analysis of the pathogen to test a gene-for-gene relationship between Stb 6 and the avirulence gene in IPO 323.

40|$|Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) {{production}} in the warm areas of South Asia is severely affected by spot blotch caused by Cochliobolus sativus. There are several inoculum sources suspected to harbor C. sativus during the off season. This {{study was conducted to}} determine survival and potential sources of C. sativus inoculum from rice stubble, wheat seed, soil and weeds in three cropping systems (wheat-rice, wheat-fallow and wheat-green manure) during the 2004 and 2005 wheat growing seasons at Rampur, Nepal. Wheat seed, soil and rice stubble in the field, and weed plants in and around research plots were examined for the presence of the pathogen. Koch’s postulates were applied to verify representative strains. The pathogen was found in the wheat seed at moderate to high levels, but was absent in soil samples and rice stubble collected from the field before wheat was sown after rice. Weeds such as Blumea sp., Dichanthium annulatum, Digitaria ciliaris, Phalaris minor, Saccharum officinarum, Axonopus compressus, Brachiaria mutica, Eleusine coracana, Panicum sp., Paspalum scrobiculatum, Pennisetum purpureum, Setaria italica, Zea mays and Zizania aquatica harbored C. sativus. The C. sativus strains isolated from these weeds infected wheat by producing typical spot blotch symptoms.

40|$|Disease escape in {{relation}} to a trade off between septoria tritici <b>blotch</b> and yield <b>of</b> <b>wheat.</b> Zymoseptoria tritici, the fungus that causes Septoria tritici <b>blotch</b> (STB) <b>of</b> <b>wheat,</b> is spread by splash borne transfer {{from the base of the}} plant to the flag leaf. This project is on a potential new source of resistance to STB discovered on chromosome 6 A using association mapping (Arraiano & Brown 2016). Near isogenic lines generated for this region show no significant differences in STB symptoms when leaves are directly inoculated with Z. tritici. However, trials that are naturally infected or inoculated at the base of the plant show clear differences in their level of STB. This indicated that this region contains genes that cause differences in disease escape. The fact that the same marker Psp 3071 is associated with yield traits (Snape et al, 2007) led to the hypothesis that the region may control a physiological trait that improves yield at the cost of aiding spore transmission. Candidate physiological traits, that could influence disease escape, have been tested in the 6 A NILs including plant height, leaf area and senescence. The trait that fits with the pattern of the disease results best is leaf emergence, with later emerging leaves getting more STB. However, the effect of the 6 A alleles on disease escape may be caused by multiple traits. Recombinant lines generated for the region have reduced the interval that contains the yield traits, though it is still unclear if the disease escape and yield effects are connected by linkage or pleiotropy...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of crop debris as inoculum source of many plant pathogens {{has been recognized}} for decades. Two important pathogens in the classical wheat-oilseed rape rotation are Zymoseptoria tritici (septoria leaf <b>blotch</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat)</b> and Leptosphaeria maculans (stem canker of oilseed rape). Both fungi initiate their sexual stages on plant debris during the intercropping period, which results in ascospore release for subsequent epidemics. Despite the importance of debris in disease outbreak, few information {{is known about the}} structure and function of microbial communities associated to this plant habitat. The objective of this work is to characterize bacterial and fungal assemblages associated to wheat and oilseed rape debris and to assess their relative impacts on the build-up of primary inoculum during theintercropping period. The challenge is to identify competitive interactions between pathogens and debris-associated micro-organisms in order to use these latter as potential biocontrol agents. The study is based on a field design composed <b>of</b> three plots (<b>wheat</b> monoculture, oilseed rape-wheat rotations) established in the experimental domain of Grignon (Paris basin). Wheat and oilseed rape crop debris are sampled thrice a year during the ascospore release period. The structure of debris-associated microbial assemblages is assessed through a combination of classical microbiological approaches and sequencing of two molecular markers (16 S rRNA gene and ITS 1 region of the fungal internal transcribed spacer). Both approaches will assess the impact of crop sequence on microbial assemblages and should ultimately lead to the identification of micro-organisms exhibiting antagonistic activities towards either Z. tritici or L. maculans. To this end, the impact of different microbial assemblages and isolated species on the ascospore production from wheat debris infected by Z. tritici will be tested in field and controlled condition experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of my work}} was to characterise principal problems of breeding programmes aiming at resistance to Septoria <b>glume</b> <b>blotch.</b> Both relative species (S. nodorum and S. tritici) which damage wheat stands particularly at a decisive growth stage, grain formation, are ones {{of the most important}} fungal diseases in cereal crops. Based on our investigations, only 6 % of varieties show apparent features of resistance. The goal of breeding effort is to develop a variety which will exhibit good performance and need minimum fungicide applications. One of problems solved was to increase effectiveness of production of a high inoculum amount and its long-term storage. A cultivation substrate, sterilised grain <b>of</b> cereals (<b>wheat),</b> met these requirements. I succeeded in improving its effectiveness (highly significantly) due to added tuber substrates (potato tuber). A principal issue prior to beginning the investigation was to find an optimum method for inoculation. A methodology for inoculation of plots and short-term installation of plastic foil covers over inoculated stands was developed. Using colour plastic foils instead of transparent ones showed to be more suitable for primary development of infection. There is a high variation in resistant and susceptible reactions of a host plant and as well as in pathogen populations. Differences among isolates are significant, however, use of an inoculum mixture reaches the effect of an isolate of the highest aggressiveness. My experiments aimed at seeking possible mechanisms which lead towards disposition of plants to disease infection confirmed a high correlation between genotype responses to stress and consequent infection development. Susceptibility to Septoria <b>blotch</b> <b>of</b> a genotype is associated with senescence mechanisms of plant organs. There are considerable differences among genotypes, which could be used in breeding. I looked for characters which exhibited sufficient stability in infection experiments between years. I found markedly higher between-year variation in infection symptoms on plant organs and their intensity in comparison with yield loss caused by infection. A collection of testing standards was formed which show high stability of reactions in tolerance characters in the field. Triticum genus is characteristic, among others, of high variation in potential reproduction of an ear including its morphological structure. Since Septoria <b>glume</b> <b>blotch</b> is a typical ear pathogen, a question arises: how highly will its harmfulness be dependent on ear structure. It was found that high-yielding types in which yield is formed by high ear weight can be damaged by Septoria <b>glume</b> <b>blotch</b> more seriously. Novel techniques for seeking tolerant materials using sprays of stands with dessicants during grain formation have been tested in the world. This technique was modified and slowly-affecting dessicant (Harvade 25 F) was used to test a methodology for breeding programmes aimed at tolerance to Septoria <b>glume</b> <b>blotch.</b> The objective <b>of</b> other experiments was to combine a visual level of infection and yield response in one factor. A so-called factor X indicates change of an absolute value of yield reduction per unit area under disease progress curve. As results show, basic criteria for selection of resistant genotypes are elements of ear productivity and their changes after Septoria blotch infection. It can be concluded that responses of some varieties (Hana and Zdar, or Asta and Siria) were resistant to infection, and particularly with regard to yield tolerance. Some genotypes provided by foreign institutions were studied for their adaptibility to domestic agroecological conditions. Based on combination crosses of resistant and susceptible parents filial generations were analysed for their potential utilissation in breeding using heritability values of visual and yield characters.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to calculate economic optimum fungicide doses accounting for the risk-aversion of growers responding to variability in disease severity between crops. Simple dose-response and disease-yield loss functions are used to estimate net disease-related costs (fungicide cost, plus disease-induced yield loss) {{as a function of}} dose and untreated severity. With fairly general assumptions about the shapes of the probability distribution of disease severity and the other functions involved, we show that a choice of fungicide dose which minimises net costs on average across seasons results in occasional large net costs caused by inadequate control in high disease seasons. This may be unacceptable to a grower with limited capital. A risk-averse grower can choose to reduce the size and frequency of such losses by applying a higher dose as insurance. For example, a grower may decide to accept ‘high loss’ years one year in ten or one year in twenty (i. e. specifying a proportion of years in which disease severity and net costs will be above a specified level). Our analysis shows that taking into account disease severity variation and risk-aversion will usually increase the dose applied by an economically rational grower. The analysis is illustrated with data on septoria tritici leaf <b>blotch</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> caused by Mycosphaerella graminicola. Observations from untreated field plots at sites across England over three years were used to estimate the probability distribution of disease severities at mid-grain filling. In the absence of a fully reliable disease forecasting scheme, reducing the frequency of ‘high loss’ years requires substantially higher doses to be applied to all crops. Disease resistant cultivars reduce both the optimal dose at all levels of risk and the disease-related costs at all doses...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from Elsevier via the doi in this record. Zymoseptoria tritici causes Septoria leaf <b>blotch</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat.</b> The {{prevailing}} paradigm of the Z. tritici-wheat interaction assumes fungal ingress through stomata within 24 – 48 h, followed by days of symptomless infection. This is extrapolated from studies testing the mode of fungal ingress under optimal infection conditions. Here, we explicitly assess the timing of entry, using GFP-tagged Z. tritici. We show that early entry is comparatively rare, and extended epiphytic growth possible. We test the hypotheses that our data diverge from earlier studies due to: i. random ingress of Z. tritici into the leaf, with some early entry events; ii. previous reliance upon fungal stains, combined with poor attachment of Z. tritici to the leaf, leading to increased likelihood of observing internal versus external growth, compared to using GFP; iii. use of exceptionally high humidity to promote entry in previous studies. We combine computer simulation of leaf-surface growth with thousands of in planta observations to demonstrate that while spores germinate rapidly on the leaf, over 95 % of fungi remain epiphytic, growing randomly over the leaf for ten days or more. We show that epiphytic fungi are easily detached from leaves by rinsing and that humidity promotes epiphytic growth, increasing infection rates. Together, these results explain why epiphytic growth has been dismissed and early ingress assumed. The prolonged epiphytic phase should inform studies of pathogenicity and virulence mutants, disease control strategies, and interpretation of the observed low in planta growth, metabolic quiescence and evasion of plant defences by Zymoseptoria during symptomless infection.

40|$|Mycosphaerella graminicola, {{cause of}} Septoria tritici leaf <b>blotch</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat,</b> is an {{important}} disease throughout the world. Information about the population structure of the pathogen is useful to improve control strategies. Molecular {{studies have shown that}} there was a high level of genetic variability within populations of M. graminicola, but no attempt was made to relate this variability to pathogenicity. The objectives of this research were to study a population of M. graminicola for both variability at the molecular level and pathogenicity and to determine whether any relationship between these two types of variability exists. Ninety isolates of M. graminicola were collected using hierarchical sampling of leaves and lesions from 10 locations within a wheat field near Saskatoon. The isolates were tested for the degree of pathogenicity (aggressiveness) on a single susceptible cultivar and the components of pathogenicity, incubation period, latent period and disease severity, were evaluated. There were significant differences among isolates for all components at the lesion sampling level only but not at the leaf and location level. A subsample of 40 isolates was tested for variability for virulence on a set of six differential cultivars. A significant isolate x cultivar interaction was detected, but since the magnitude of the variability was low no attempt was made to classify the isolates into races. Using 15 RAPD primers the percentage of polymorphic loci, number of molecular phenotypes (haplotypes) and gene diversity of 90 isolates were estimated. A high level of genetic variability was found within the population. Partitioning this variability into different components showed that most of the variability was distributed within locations. This type of distribution suggested that air-borne ascospores were the primary source of inoculum in the field. A similar type of distribution of genetic variability was detected using eight microsatellite markers. Little relationship between molecular and pathogenic variability was found, suggesting that DNA fingerprinting has little value for monitoring the development of new virulent genotypes of the pathogen...|$|R
40|$|Stagonospora nodorum is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen, and {{the causal}} agent <b>of</b> stagonospora nodorum <b>blotch</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat.</b> Despite the {{economic}} {{importance of this}} disease, the molecular basis of the pathosystem is poorly understood. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the interaction between metabolism and infection in this pathosystem, with particular reference to the metabolism of mannitol. In common with many fungi, the main metabolite produced by S. nodorum is the acyclic hexitol mannitol. Among the previously suggested roles for this compound is a role in pathogenicity. The metabolism of mannitol has been hypothesised as occurring in a cycle involving the enzymes mannitol 2 -dehydrogenase (Mdh 1) and mannitol 1 -phosphate 5 dehydrogenase (Mpd 1). A strain was created harbouring disruption constructs for both of these genes. The double mutant was unable to synthesise or catabolise mannitol, and was unable to sporulate. Addition of exogenous mannitol completely restored in vitro sporulation, and partially restored in planta sporulation. This demonstrated an essential role for mannitol in asexual sporulation. This is the first demonstrated role for this compound. A 13 C NMR study of the wild type strain, the mdh 1 and mpd 1 single mutants, and mpd 1 mdh 1 double mutant was undertaken to investigate carbon utilisation and cycling. Disruption of Mpd 1 significantly altered the metabolite profile with the mpd 1 mutants producing trehalose and glycerol in place of mannitol. Labelling patterns in the double mutant showed that scrambling of label can be explained by the triosephosphate isomerase triangle and pentose phosphate pathway. This suggests the contribution of mannitol to label scrambling has been overstated in previous studies. The evidence did not support the metabolism of mannitol in S. nodorum as occurring in a cycle, but rather as two separate pathways. A GC-MS analysis of diseased and non-diseased tissue from infected leaves, compared to non-infected and mock-inoculated leaves, could not detect any metabolites associated with a systemic host reaction to pathogen attack...|$|R

It is the causal agent <b>of</b> Stagonospora nodorum <b>blotch</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat,</b> a major disease causing upwards of 100 million dollars (AU) damage in yield loss per annum. Stagonospora nodorum {{is a member}} of the Dothideomycete class of filamentous ascomycetes. Within this class are numerous plant pathogens that rely on secondary metabolite (SM) phytotoxins of the polyketide class as pathogenicity and/or virulence factors. While the production of proteinaceous host specific toxins has been studied extensively in S. nodorum, the role of secondary metabolites in the pathogenic lifecycle of this fungus is completely unexplored. In this study a combination of bioinformatics, molecular biology and analytical chemistry techniques are used to investigate polyketide synthesis in S. nodorum. In silico analysis of polyketide synthase (PKS) gene and protein sequences was used to catalogue and classify the PKS repertoire of S. nodorum, assign putative functions to PKS genes based on homology, identify PKS gene clusters and elucidate the phylogenetic history of PKSs in S. nodorum. Transcriptomics techniques were used to identify genes active during important stages of the pathogenic lifecycle as candidates for targeted gene deletion experiments. The role these genes play in host colonisation and disease progression was analysed using knockout mutagenesis and in vitro and in planta characterisation of mutant strains. Secondary metabolite extraction and LC-MS analysis techniques were evaluated to identify key compounds produced by the wild type fungus that were differentially abundant in the knockout mutants. With this approach, a highly conserved alternative melanisation pathway gene cluster involving the putative DHN-melanin synthase MEL 1, a putative oxidoreductase and a putative transcription factor has been identified. Further findings highlighted a rapid evolution and plasticity of PKS genes in S. nodorum. Knockout mutants for the SMS 1, PKS 1 and PKS 3 polyketide synthase genes have been generated and were tested for defects in pathogenicity, metabolism and sporulation. No significant differences to the wild type were detected, indicating a menial role for these genes during pathogenesis. An SPE based method for isolating SM from culture filtrate was developed and used to identify compounds produced by S. nodorum in liquid culture, as well as two putative polyketide products absent in cultures of the SMS 1 knockout mutant putatively linked to a cryptic mycotoxin pathway...|$|R

Physiologic specialization exists in M. graminicola, and the specificity is manifested both by host and pathogen (Kema et al. 1996).

To determine the nature of inheritance involving selected genotypes, three resistant semidwarf spring wheat lines exhibiting durable global resistance and one susceptible cultivar were crossed in all possible combinations, excluding reciprocals. Parents, Fl, F 2, and F 3 generations were inoculated with one pathogenic strain of Septoria tritici and evaluated under field conditions. Data were collected on an individual plant basis. F 2 and F 3 frequency distributions were computed to determine the nature of inheritance. Combining ability analysis of the 4 x 4 diallel cross and narrow-sense heritability were employed to estimate the nature of gene action. Phenotypic correlations were obtained to examined the possible association between disease severity traits and their relationship with heading date and plant height. The continuous distribution of the F 2 and F 3 populations among crosses {{made it impossible to}} classify plants into discrete classes in crosses between resistant x susceptible genotypes. Mean values of the disease traits Septoria progress coefficient, Relative coefficient of infection, and Septoria severity of flag leaf among the segregating populations were similar to the midparent values. Transgressive segregation was also observed in the F 2 and F 3 suggesting that parents had different resistance genes. Additive gene effects were found to be the major component of variation although nonadditive gene action {{played an important role in}} the expression of all three disease traits. The resistant parents Bobwhite"S" and Kavkaz /K 4500 L. A. 4 were found to have the largest negative general combining ability effects for the disease traits suggesting that these parents would be the best source for resistance to Septoria leaf blotch. High general combining ability and high narrow sense heritability estimates in the F 3 population, indicated that substantial progress for resistance to Septoria tritici would be effective selecting in this generation. Of the three disease measures it would appear that selection for the lowest percentage of Septoria infection on the flag leaf would provide the most progress in developing resistant cultivars. Moderate and low negative phenotypic correlations were found among generations for the disease traits with heading date and plant height.
