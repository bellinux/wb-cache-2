25|$|Started with an <b>empty</b> <b>file,</b> the {{a command}} appends text (all ed {{commands}} are single letters). The command puts ed in insert mode, inserting the characters that follow and is terminated {{by a single}} dot on a line. The two lines that are entered before the dot {{end up in the}} file buffer. The 2i command also goes into insert mode, and will insert the entered text (a single empty line in our case) before line two. All commands may be prefixed by a line number to operate on that line.|$|E

50|$|In simple {{file system}} benchmarks, the {{fragmentation}} factor is often omitted, as realistic aging and fragmentation {{is difficult to}} model.

5000|$|The Unix command dd of=sparse-file bs=1k seek=5120 count=0will {{create a}} file of five mebibytes in size, {{but with no}} data stored on disk (only metadata).

50|$|By default {{the first}} line number written to an <b>empty</b> <b>file</b> is 1, and is {{incremented}} by 1 with each subsequent write. By default, reading a file starts with {{the first line}} number at or above 1 and continues by reading each line in order of increasing line numbers. This means that negative line numbers are invisible parts of a file, which require specific references to read.|$|E

5000|$|On 13 October 1894, {{without any}} {{tangible}} evidence {{and with an}} <b>empty</b> <b>file,</b> General Mercier summoned Captain Dreyfus for a general inspection in [...] "bourgeois clothing", i.e. in civilian clothes. The purpose of the General Staff was to obtain the perfect proof under French law: a confession. That confession was to be obtained by surprise - by dictating a letter based on the bordereau to reveal his guilt.|$|E
50|$|On 4 December 1894 Dreyfus was {{referred}} to the first Military Court with the <b>empty</b> <b>file.</b> The secrecy was lifted and M. Demange could access the file for the first time. After reading it the lawyer had absolute confidence, as he saw the emptiness of the prosecution’s case. The prosecution rested completely on the writing on {{a single piece of}} paper, the bordereau, on which experts disagreed, and on vague indirect testimonies.|$|E

25|$|BITS uses a queue {{to manage}} file transfers. A BITS session {{has to be}} started from an {{application}} by creating a Job. A job is a container, which has one or more files to transfer. A newly created job is <b>empty.</b> <b>Files</b> must be added, specifying both the source and destination URIs. While a download job can have any number of files, upload jobs can have only one. Properties can be set for individual files. Jobs inherit the security context of the application that creates them.|$|R
50|$|The Shadow of Death can be {{installed}} alongside the first Heroes of Might and Magic III expansion pack, Armageddon's Blade. New features included in the Armageddon's Blade expansion (such as the Conflux town) are present in The Shadow of Death, but are designed to remain hidden and inaccessible unless certain files installed by Armageddon's Blade are detected in the game's directory. The game, however, checks only {{for the presence of}} these files: it does not verify the file contents. Because of this, several gamers discovered {{that it was possible to}} create <b>empty</b> <b>files</b> with the correct file names to unlock the Armageddon's Blade enhancements in The Shadow of Death without having to install the earlier expansion pack.|$|R
50|$|One journal is {{maintained}} for each NTFS volume {{and stored in}} the NTFS metafile named $Extend\$UsnJrnl. It begins as an <b>empty</b> <b>file.</b> Whenever a change is made to the volume, a record {{is added to the}} file. Each record is identified by a 64-bit Update Sequence Number or USN. (For this reason Change Journals are sometimes called USN Journals.) Each record in the Change Journal contains the USN, the name of the file, and information about what the change was.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{example is}} the unwelcome {{behavior}} in the following fragments. Both of these appear to mean, [...] "If 'myfile' does not exist, create it by writing 'mytext' into it." [...] But the version on the right always creates an <b>empty</b> <b>file</b> because the C shell's order of evaluation {{is to look for}} and evaluate I/O redirection operators on each command line as it reads it, before examining the rest of the line to see whether it contains a control structure.|$|E
5000|$|Started with an <b>empty</b> <b>file,</b> the {{a command}} appends text (all ed {{commands}} are single letters).

40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{internship}} report is the performance evaluation of a Cluster file system called Lustre, before its installation into a computing Cluster, or other computing systems. Performance evaluation includes benchmarks, comparison to other file systems (ext 3, NFS), and study of tuning possibilities. In this report we first present the file system Lustre, and then we explain how the tests were driven, including the methodology of the tests, {{the installation of the}} test platform, and a preliminary research of the main bottlenecks. Three types of benchmarks have been driven: read/write of big files, including both sequential and random access, in order to test the throughput; read/write of small files, in order to test the cache efficiency; and creation/deletion of <b>empty</b> <b>files,</b> in order to test the access times. The aim is to see in which cases it is convenient to use the Lustre file system...|$|R
50|$|It {{all started}} in 1980 with an <b>empty</b> <b>file</b> cabinet, {{a desk and}} a savvy {{businessman}} named Lou Grassi, who possessed a keen insight into the necessary components of success. After {{more than a quarter}} century, Grassi & Co. {{is now one of the}} nation’s elite accounting firms and among the Top 100 largest firms in the United States. Also ranked by Crain’s New York Business as one of the Top 20 largest accounting firms in New York and by Long Island Business News as one of the Top 10 largest on Long Island, Grassi & Co. is a full-service tax, accounting, and business advisory firm with three offices throughout the New York Metro area (New York City, NY; Jericho, NY; New City, NY).|$|E
5000|$|The command was {{originally}} {{implemented in the}} first version of UNIX as a method to initialize either a DECtape (using the [...] "t" [...] argument) or an RK03 disk pack (using the [...] "r" [...] argument). The initialization process would write formatting data to the device so that it contained an <b>empty</b> <b>file</b> system. It created the super-block, i-list, and free list on the storage device and established the root directory with entries for [...] "." [...] and [...] ".." [...] (self and parent, respectively). The RK03 disk packs had 4872 available blocks after initialization, while the tapes had 578 blocks (at 512 bytes/block). The mkfs executable was kept in the /etc directory instead of a binary directory so it would not be inadvertently called and destroy information.|$|E

5000|$|Because of its legacy origins, the {{contents}} of textClipping files are not stored inside the actual data [...] "fork" [...] of the file, and the files cannot easily be shared between Macs or sent to other machines like an attachment. Opening the textClipping file in most applications will show a 0 byte <b>empty</b> data <b>file.</b> When OSX views or performs an action on a textClipping file, it performs a lookup of the file's resource fork where {{the contents}} are actually stored.|$|R
50|$|Stepping {{back to the}} {{previous}} iteration, we were reading from 1 and 2. One run is merged from 1 and 2 before <b>file</b> 1 goes <b>empty.</b> Notice that <b>file</b> 2 is not completely consumed—it has one run left to match the final merge (above).|$|R
50|$|BITS uses a queue {{to manage}} file transfers. A BITS session {{has to be}} started from an {{application}} by creating a Job. A job is a container, which has one or more files to transfer. A newly created job is <b>empty.</b> <b>Files</b> must be added, specifying both the source and destination URIs. While a download job can have any number of files, upload jobs can have only one. Properties can be set for individual files. Jobs inherit the security context of the application that creates them.BITS provides API access to control jobs. A job can be programmatically started, stopped, paused, resumed, and queried for status. Before starting a job, a priority has to be set for it to specify when the job is processed relative to other jobs in the transfer queue. By default, all jobs are of Normal priority. Jobs can optionally be set to High, Low, or Foreground priority. Background transfers are optimized by BITS, which increases and decreases (or throttles) the rate of transfer based {{on the amount of}} idle network bandwidth that is available. If a network application begins to consume more bandwidth, BITS decreases its transfer rate to preserve the user's interactive experience, except for Foreground priority downloads.|$|R
