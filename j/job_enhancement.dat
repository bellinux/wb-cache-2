30|$|The {{advanced}} practice physiotherapist (APP) or extended scope physiotherapist (ESP) {{has been}} defined as “a clinical specialist, who has the opportunity to develop and demonstrate expertise beyond the currently recognised scope of practice, including some aspect of <b>job</b> <b>enhancement</b> or expansion, involving the areas of extended therapeutics, diagnostics and practice consultation” [6]. The terms have previously been described as interchangeable [7], and APP has been adopted by the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists. APPs are specialist physiotherapists who perform some tasks traditionally performed by doctors, such as patient assessment, diagnosis and treatment, joint injection, removal of plaster of Paris and K-wires, and listing for surgery [8]. Drivers {{for the development of the}} role have been identified as expanding outpatient waiting lists with concurrent increases in waiting times, large volumes of inappropriate consultant referrals and increasing prevalence of chronic musculoskeletal problems. Several systematic reviews have evaluated the APP role [6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. While it is acknowledged that the methodological quality of those studies is poor, all authors have concluded that the majority of evidence supports the role.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} factors {{affecting}} employee's acceptance and {{intention to use}} the e-Learning system called the iLearn. Combining the Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT) with Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the present study proposes an extended technology acceptance model. The proposed model was tested with data collected from 100 employees with various position backgrounds {{from one of the}} Automotive Semiconductor Company in Northern Malaysia who currently uses the iLearn (an e-Learning gateway) training system. The results indicated gender, age, position and comfortableness of using computer are the factors affecting the employee's acceptance and intention towards the use of the iLearn system. The employees behavioural intention (BI) was shown to be significantly influenced by perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEU) towards the iLearn system. Specifically, IDT has been utilized to examine factors affecting the adoption of the iLearn system by employees for the purpose of <b>job</b> <b>enhancement.</b> The relative advantage (ADV) shows a positive effect on the PU, PEU and BI. Meanwhile, the result shows that compatibility (CPA) had negative effect on the PU, PEU and BI. Meanwhile, trialability (TRI) and complexity (CPL) had positive effect on PEU, but negative effect on PU and BI. Observability (OBS) had positive effect on PU but negative effect on PEU and BI. These findings suggest that Human Resource Training and Development of the company should consider factors of technology acceptance and employee's intention towards the iLearn system to enhance their skills and knowledge in order to achieve excellent job performance...|$|E

The “PFORCA” Plan aims to counteract this reality and increase their level of self-sufficiency. The financial aid relating to the REA reduces the amount payable for the imported fodder (annual 83, 000 t) versus local product, which influences the decision making by farmers. According to calculations, performed by reusing the water instead of discharging, Maralfalfa production could be competitive against imports, being financially viable with water prices in a range of 0. 20 – 0. 30 €/m 3 (prices perfectly acceptable for reclaimed water with low levels of treatment, but fulfilling requirements reuse of Spanish law, RD 1620 / 2007).

40|$|This {{qualitative}} research examined the leadership styles {{and professional development}} practices of a police department, the reflective experiences of police sergeants as they transition from being patrol officers, {{and the perception of}} police sergeants of their career development. Specifically, this study sought to answer the following essential questions: (a) What are the self-reported and observed leadership styles and practices of police sergeants at the Echo Bay police department? (b) To what extent do police sergeants practice the tenants of transformational leadership, and (c) How do police departments develop the leadership competencies of their police sergeants. The researcher used four different techniques (a) in-depth interviews, (b) focus groups, (c) direct observations, and (d) a survey as part of the qualitative component of the research and the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire as part of its selection activity. The results using a coding process revealed some major themes that indicated that sergeants used idealized attributes, individualized consideration, inspirational motivation; all features of transformational leadership. The studied police department promoted professional development by offering tuition reimbursement, <b>job</b> <b>enhancement,</b> and job enrichment. The research revealed that the police department had an informal talent management system which included: coaching, mentoring, job rotation, and job expansion. The researcher recommended that further research should include the entire command structure (patrol officer to commissioner) and, most importantly, the institutionalization of a talent management system in which patrol officers are exposed to leadership development early in their careers to help navigate the complex law enforcement landscape of the 21 st century...|$|E

Instead, teamwork and skill enhancement cluster to indicate one type of high performance work system, whereas job autonomy and performance-based pay constellate to identify another type. Multivariate analyses reveal that institutional mimetic isomorphism is the major factor that compels organizations to implement a certain work system. Organizations mimic their peers in their strategic adoption of different work systems. In addition, foreign market competition increases organizational adoption of teamwork and training programs to enhance skills.

40|$|Job {{scheduling}} in {{data centers}} {{can be considered}} from a cyber-physical point of view, as it affects the data center’s computing performance (i. e. the cyber aspect) and energy efficiency (the physical aspect). Driven by the growing needs to green contemporary data centers, this paper uses recent technological advances in data center virtualization and proposes cyber-physical, spatio-temporal (i. e. start time and servers assigned), thermal-aware job scheduling algorithms that minimize the energy consumption of the data center under performance constraints (i. e. deadlines). Savings are possible {{by being able to}} temporally “spread ” the workload, assign it to energy-efficient computing equipment, and further reduce the heat recirculation and therefore the load on the cooling systems. This paper provides three categories of thermal-aware energy-saving scheduling techniques: a) FCFS-Backfill-XInt and FCFS-Backfill-LRH, thermal-aware <b>job</b> placement <b>enhancements</b> to the popular first-come first-serve with back-filling (FCFSbackfill) scheduling policy; b) EDF-LRH, an online earliest-deadline-first scheduling algorithm with thermal-aware placement; and c) an offline genetic algorithm for SCheduling to minimize thermal cross-INTerference (SCINT), which is suited for batch scheduling of backlogs. Simulation results, based on real job logs from the ASU Fulton HPC data center, show that the thermal-aware enhancements to FCFS-backfill achieve up to 25 % savings compared to FCFS-backfill with first-fit placement, depending on the intensity of the incoming workload, while SCINT achieves up to 60 % savings. The performance of EDF-LRH nears that of the offline SCINT for low loads, and it degrades to the performance of FCFS-backfill for high loads. However, EDF-LRH requires millisecond...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop and evaluate e€ective, computationally e�cient procedures for scheduling jobs in a large-scale manufacturing system involving, for example, over 1000 jobs and over 100 machines. The main performance measure is maximum lateness; and a useful lower bound on maximum lateness is derived from a relaxed scheduling problem in which preemption of jobs is based on the latest ®nish time of each job at each machine. To construct a production schedule that minimizes maximum lateness, an iterative simulation-based scheduling algorithm operates as follows: (a) job queuing times observed at each machine in the previous simulation iteration are used to compute a re®ned estimate of the e€ective due date (slack) for each job at each machine; and (b) in the current simulation iteration, jobs are dispatched at each machine in order of increasing slack. Iterations of the scheduling algorithm terminate when the lower bound on maximum lateness is achieved or the iteration limit is reached. This scheduling algorithm is implemented in Virtual Factory, a Windows-based software package. The performance of Virtual Factory is demonstrated in a suite of randomly generated test problems as well as in a large furniture manufacturing facility. To further reduce maximum lateness, a second scheduling algorithm also incorporates a tabu search procedure that identi®es process plans with alternative operations and routings for <b>jobs.</b> This <b>enhancement</b> yields improved schedules that minimize manufacturing costs while satisfying job due dates. An extensive experimental performance evaluation indicates that in a broad range of industrial settings, the second scheduling algorithm can rapidly identify optimal or nearly optimal schedules. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper investigates how {{to reduce}} error and {{increase}} speed of Back propagation ANN by certain defined Capacity factor. For the years from 1965 to 1980 {{the use of a}} variety of ANNs for problem solving was relented significantly because of limitations in one layer networks that weren’t good enough for enhancements of a specific issue, although there were low expectancies for even simple tasks and mathematical operations. Multi-layer networks have a serious covenant to improve this privation by more effective error reduction for example by least squares error method and a better learning factor like the one that is considered in MLP which is modified, enhanced version of Perception network that has provided a better chance of using these networks for intelligent signal processing. But {{the purpose of this paper}} is not showing capabilities of these networks alone but to consider error reduction while the weighting equations both satisfy ordinary task of algorithm and at the same time reduces presumptions of errors by a predetermined Capacitance factor that is not very anomalous to other bunch of clustering pedagogy styles anent the other types of ANNs. Unlike a single layer network with many limitations in learning, approximating and estimating a mapping function, multi-layer networks are well prepared for estimation of any uniformly continues subordination with tunable accuracy. Hidden layer in many applications does the <b>job</b> of <b>enhancement,</b> but sometimes poly-layer methods are used for this error reduction separately by some factor definitions (and new hidden parts that paper adds to gets error reduced) that paper tries to measure for exact improvements which were envisaged in design process. And as a result understand how to use Capacity factor for BPANN algorithm, and error reduction in general that holds convergence, speed improvement and error smoothing at the same time...|$|R
30|$|From a {{theoretical}} standpoint, {{the improvement of}} access to information via mobile phone service might affect the efficiency of labor market intermediation through several channels. Economic theory predicts that the larger the cost of search, the less extensive will be the searches undertaken by workers at a given wage distribution (e.g., Stigler 1962, Mortensen 1986). A direct effect of introducing mobile phones in labor market intermediation is a direct fall in search costs as workers can access relevant, up-to-date information on job vacancies via SMS. Standard search models predict that both {{the rate at which}} offers arrive and the probability of receiving a job offer will increase as a result of search costs decreasing. A second channel through which improved information via mobile phones affects the labor markets is via better arbitrage of prices (wages), which might lead to higher wages being offered to workers (Grossman and Stigler 1976). Information is, after all, capital that is produced at the lower cost of search and, thus, yields higher returns than what would have been received in its absence. A third channel is by better matching workers to <b>jobs</b> due to <b>enhancements</b> in search and coordination tasks (Aker and Mbiti 2010).|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} a Modular Neural Network (MNN) can combine various speech {{enhancement}} modules, {{each of which is}} a Deep Neural Network (DNN) specialized on a particular <b>enhancement</b> <b>job.</b> Differently from an ordinary ensemble technique that averages variations in models, the propose MNN selects the best module for the unseen test signal to produce a greedy ensemble. We see this as Collaborative Deep Learning (CDL), because it can reuse various already-trained DNN models without any further refining. In the proposed MNN selecting the best module during run time is challenging. To this end, we employ a speech AutoEncoder (AE) as an arbitrator, whose input and output are trained to be as similar as possible if its input is clean speech. Therefore, the AE can gauge the quality of the module-specific denoised result by seeing its AE reconstruction error, e. g. low error means that the module output is similar to clean speech. We propose an MNN structure with various modules that are specialized on dealing with a specific noise type, gender, and input Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) value, and empirically prove that it almost always works better than an arbitrarily chosen DNN module and sometimes as good as an oracle result...|$|R
40|$|University {{business}} incubators (UBIs) are {{organizations that}} provide new startup companies with a support environment. However, there are split {{opinions on the}} UBIs’ contributions to the startups and the regional economy and, consequently, there are also split opinions on  how to assess UBI performance. According to the resource-based view (RBV), a company’s competitive advantage results from the various resources the company has access to. The biotechnology industry is characterized by high research intensity, weak entrepreneurial and managerial skills of the entrepreneur, huge capital requirements, and long product  evelopment approval processes. Previous research has showed that these characteristics imply certain challenges for new biotech ventures. In this study, these industry specific characteristic and challenges were believed to affect what constitutes successful bioincubation and how bio-incubators’ performance should be assessed. The purpose of this report is, thus, to examine how bio-incubator performance can, and should be, assessed. An existing framework for assessing UBI performance {{is used as a}} basis for performing  emistructured interviews with 18 incubator managers in order to examine what performance indicators are perceived as robust for assessing bio-incubator performance. The findings show that the value contributions of bio-incubators mainly include space and network provision, support services, and coaching. The perceived value contributions, in combination with the perceived challenges, imply that it is particularly appropriate to assess bio-incubators performance in terms of <b>Job</b> Creation, Economy <b>Enhancement,</b> Access to Funds, and the Incubator Offer and Internal Environment. However, Job Creation and Economy Enhancement are closely related and are therefore suggested to be merged into a single performance indicator. Hardware and Services, on the other hand, seems to be less relevant for assessing bio-incubator performance as it depends on the incubator’s strategy. The study concludes that there are additional ways of assessing bio-incubator performance, such as shortened time to graduation, links with universities, and the flexibility of the incubator. Further research may include the entrepreneurs’ point of view or use the approach of this study to examine incubator performance in other high-technology industries...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, it is {{becoming}} more and more clear that the localisation industry does not have the necessary manpower to satisfy the increasing demand for high-quality translation. This has fuelled the search new and existing technologies that would increase translator throughput. As Translation Memory (TM) systems are the most commonly employed tool by translators, a number of enhancements are available to assist them in their <b>job.</b> One such <b>enhancement</b> would be to show the translator which parts of the sentence that needs to be translated match which parts of the fuzzy match suggested by the TM. For this information to be used, however, the translators have to carry it over to the TM translation themselves. In this paper, we present a novel methodology that can automatically detect and highlight the segments that need to be modified in a TM-­suggested translation. We base it on state-­of-the-art sub-­tree align- ment technology (Zhechev, 2010) that can produce aligned phrase-­based-­tree pairs from unannotated data. Our system operates in a three-­step process. First, the fuzzy match selected by the TM and its translation are aligned. This lets us know which segments of the source-­language sentence correspond to which segments in its translation. In the second step, the fuzzy match is aligned to the input sentence that is currently being translated. This tells us which parts of the input sentence are available in the fuzzy match and which still need to be translated. In the third step, the fuzzy match is used as an intermediary, through which the alignments between the input sentence and the TM translation are established. In this way, we can detect with precision the segments in the suggested translation that the translator needs to edit and highlight them appropriately to set them apart from the segments that are already good translations for parts of the input sentence. Additionally, we can show the alignments—as detected by our system—between the input and the translation, which will make it even easier for the translator to post-edit the TM suggestion. This alignment information can additionally be used to pre- translate the mismatched segments, further reducing the post-­editing load...|$|R

Kivlighan This {{qualitative}} study investigated and determined both commonalities {{and differences in}} a school system's high school principals' perceptions and expectations of the High School Dropout Prevention/Intervention Services Specialist position. These positions are more {{commonly referred to as}} student intervention specialists, and the individuals hired for these positions primarily focus on reducing high school dropouts and supporting students' efforts to graduate. The researcher used face-to-face interviews to determine critical responsibilities of the student intervention specialist position. Principals were asked five open-ended questions to evoke their perceptions {{of the role of the}} student intervention specialist in preventing dropouts and increasing graduation rates of high school students. Sixteen themes emerged from the principal interviews. Ten themes were specific descriptors of the responsibilities of the student intervention specialist as perceived by the principals: advocates and relationship builders, staff liaisons, community connectors, team members, academic supporters, attendance monitors, crisis managers, transition facilitators, cohort graduation monitors, and graduation coaches. Six of the emerged themes were identified changes or support for the student intervention specialist position: resources, employment, caseloads, professional development, qualifications, and the position as a worthwhile investment. The study validates the support principals have for the student intervention specialist position in reducing dropouts and increasing graduation rates. The researcher offers ten recommendations as a result of the study which may further contribute to the position's success: a review of the current job description, a change of the <b>job</b> title, an <b>enhancement</b> of available resources to support the position, the development of a contact list of community resources, an expansion of the position from 10 -months to 12 -months, differentiated professional development, manageable caseloads, information supplied to high school principals regarding the outcomes of the study, refinements to hiring practices, and a review of the study by senior staff. The results of this study are important because of the increasing need for students to minimally graduate from high school to prepare for the 21 st century workforce. Each school system must use limited resources to maximize student achievement. An outcome of this study confirms the worth of the student intervention specialist in support of this effort at a minimal cost and a substantial return on investment...|$|R
