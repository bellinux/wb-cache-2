On a speaking tour of the US and Canada he lectured at Yale University, and then took the ferry to Toronto; as it entered the harbour, <b>he</b> <b>collapsed</b> and died, aged 49; Horne was aged seven at the time. From September that year Horne attended St George's School, Harpenden as a boarder—the seventh of the Horne children to attend the school. Although he was not strong academically, he developed into a good sportsman, representing the school in rugby and cricket, and during the summer holidays {{took part in the}} Public Schoolboys Lawn Tennis Championship at Queen's Club; in his final appearance in 1925 he was knocked out by the future Wimbledon finalist Bunny Austin.|$|E
5|$|Douglas and Jean MacArthur {{spent their}} last years {{together}} in the penthouse of the Waldorf Towers, {{a part of the}} Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.

In that year, he earned a salary of $68,000 (equivalent to $612,000 in 2016), in addition to $20,000 pay and allowances as a General of the Army. The Waldorf became the setting for an annual birthday party on 26 January thrown by the general's former deputy chief engineer, Major General Leif J. Sverdrup. At the 1960 celebration for MacArthur's 80th birthday, many of his friends were startled by the general's obviously deteriorating health. The next day, <b>he</b> <b>collapsed</b> and was rushed into surgery at St. Luke's Hospital to control a severely swollen prostate.|$|E

In March 1910, he was staying at Biarritz when <b>he</b> <b>collapsed.</b> He remained there to convalesce, while in London Asquith tried to get the Finance Bill passed. The King's continued ill health was unreported and he attracted criticism for staying in France while political tensions were so high. On 27 April he returned to Buckingham Palace, still suffering from severe bronchitis. Alexandra returned from visiting her brother, King George I of Greece, in Corfu a week later on 5 May.|$|E

5|$|From 1875 until 1903, Hibs were {{managed by}} a committee, {{although}} Dan McMichael, who also acted as treasurer, secretary and a physiotherapist, was effectively the manager when the club won the 1902 Scottish Cup and the 1903 league championship. Willie McCartney {{took charge of}} part of the league-winning 1947–48 season, but <b>he</b> <b>collapsed</b> and died after a Scottish Cup match in January 1948. Hugh Shaw inherited that team, {{and went on to}} win three league championships in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Alan Stubbs won the Scottish Cup in 2015–16, ending a 114-year drought in that competition. Eddie Turnbull, Alex Miller and John Collins all won one Scottish League Cup each.

5|$|Henry's {{succession}} {{plans were}} thrown into chaos by {{the sinking of}} the White Ship on 25 November 1120. Henry had left the port of Barfleur for England in the early evening, leaving William Adelin and many of the younger members of the court to follow on that night in a separate vessel, the White Ship.

Henry's court was initially too scared to report William's death to the King. When he was finally told, <b>he</b> <b>collapsed</b> with grief.|$|E
5|$|In another case, 28-year-old British student Nathan Layton was {{bitten by}} a black mamba and {{died of a heart}} attack in less than an hour in March 2008.

Layton was bitten by the snake on his index finger while it was being put into a jar, but he didn't realize he'd been bitten. He thought the snake had only brushed his hand. Approximately 30 minutes after being bitten Layton complained of blurred vision. <b>He</b> <b>collapsed</b> and {{died of a heart attack}}, nearly an hour after being bitten. Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at the scene.|$|E
