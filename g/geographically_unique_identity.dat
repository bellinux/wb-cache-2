40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to explore approaches to create <b>unique</b> <b>identities</b> by the de-duplication process using multi-modal biometrics. Various government sectors in the world provide different services and welfare schemes for the beneffit {{of the people in}} the society using an <b>identity</b> number. A <b>unique</b> <b>identity</b> (UID) number assigned for every person would obviate the need for a person to produce multiple documentary proofs of his/her identity for availing any government/private services. In the process of creating <b>unique</b> <b>identity</b> of a person, there is a possibility of duplicate identities as the same person might want to get multiple identities in order to get extra beneffits from the Government. These duplicate identities can be eliminated by the de-duplication process using multi-modal biometrics, namely, iris, ngerprint, face and signature. De-duplication is the process of removing instances of multiple enrollments of the same person using the person's biometric data. As the number of people enrolledinto the biometric system runs into billions, the time complexity increases in the de duplication process. In this thesis, three different case studies are presented to address the performance issues of de-duplication process in order to create <b>unique</b> <b>identity</b> of a person...|$|R

40|$|Human cloning until {{recently}} {{has been considered}} {{to belong to the}} domain of science fiction; now it is a tangible possibility, a hopeful as well as a fearsome one. One of the fears that necessarily come along with it is about the peril cloning might represent for human uniqueness, since the clones are expected to be identical to their prototypes; this would unavoidably compromise moral agents’ right to a <b>unique</b> <b>identity.</b> In this paper I will put under examination the argument against cloning that is based upon the right to a unique identity; I will argue that cloning represents no actual threat for anybody’s <b>unique</b> <b>identity,</b> therefore this argument is futile. I will also support the view that the so-called right to a <b>unique</b> <b>identity</b> is not as indisputable as to serve as the basis of a moral argument against human reproductive cloning...|$|R
