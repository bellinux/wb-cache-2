5|$|During the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s British Railways (Southern Region) {{completed}} its Kent Coast Electrification schemes, {{which meant that}} most of the remaining services from the station were electrified, including boat trains. Some minor services were withdrawn, and the few remaining steam services, to Oxted and beyond, were replaced by <b>diesel-electric</b> multiple units. Various plans were proposed at this time to redevelop Victoria, including new offices, hotels and a helicopter station. The last steam service left Victoria on 8 January 1964 to , after which it was replaced by <b>diesel-electric</b> multiple units.|$|E
5|$|Metro began {{testing a}} fleet of new hybrid <b>diesel-electric</b> buses in 2002, {{intending}} to use them in the bus tunnel {{before and after the}} conversion to joint bus-rail operations. The first few of a planned fleet of 235 hybrid <b>diesel-electric</b> articulated buses began operating on tunnel bus routes in June 2004. The Breda dual-mode trolleybuses were removed from the tunnel in January 2005 and would later be refurbished into electric-only trolleybuses for use on the city's trolleybus network. The last day of trolleybus operation in the tunnel was January 24, 2005, with only a single dual-mode bus in service on the final day.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January 1986, a Class 104 diesel {{multiple}} unit suffered a brake failure, passed three signals at danger and collided with a Class 47 <b>diesel-electric</b> locomotive near Preston. Forty-four people were injured.|$|E
5|$|Served by steam {{locomotives}} {{from opening}} {{until the late}} 1950s, passenger services were then taken over by a fleet of <b>diesel-electric</b> multiple units built to the line's loading gauge. Diesel locomotives handled freight, also built to fit the loading gauge. The <b>diesel-electric</b> multiple units served on the line until 1986, when the line was electrified and the most severely affected tunnels were reduced from double track to single.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, CT purchased its {{fleet of}} 15 hybrid <b>diesel-electric</b> buses from New Flyer, {{at a cost}} of $879,028 per vehicle, to be paid for with state and federal subsidies.|$|E
5|$|The {{class was}} {{gradually}} replaced {{in the southeast}} England during the late 1950s and early 1960s due {{to the introduction of}} further electrification, new lightweight standard steam classes, diesel shunters, and <b>diesel-electric</b> multiple units. By the end of 1963 the majority that remained were based at Bournemouth to work the Swanage branch.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequences}} {{involving the}} armoured train were filmed on the Nene Valley Railway, near Peterborough in the UK. The train {{was composed of}} a British Rail Class 20 <b>diesel-electric</b> locomotive {{and a pair of}} BR Mk 1 coaches, all three heavily disguised to resemble a Soviet armoured train.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Caltrans {{released}} the first feasibility study detailing {{the possibility of}} electrifying the railroad between San Francisco and San Jose. The 1992 Feasibility Study proposed replacing the existing <b>diesel-electric</b> locomotives with either a fleet of EMD AEM-7 electric locomotives to move the existing gallery passenger cars or Metro North Budd M-2/M-4 EMUs. The primary benefits of an electrified railway would be improvements in air quality, noise, and acceleration, but would also save on other ancillary costs, such as lubricating oil, cooling water, maintenance, and refueling. Because of the relatively close spacing between stops, the improved acceleration using electric locomotives compared to the existing <b>diesel-electric</b> locomotives would cut transit time between San Francisco and San Jose by up to twelve minutes, and using EMUs would cut the time over the same distance by up to 23 minutes, assuming the use of ten-car trainsets. The 1992 Feasibility Study recommended the use of electric locomotives and 25kV AC overhead lines as the most cost-effective alternative, since the gallery cars, which had been built in 1985, were then relatively new and could be reused.|$|E
5|$|The British Rail Class 47 is a {{class of}} British railway <b>diesel-electric</b> {{locomotive}} that {{was developed in the}} 1960s by Brush Traction. A total of 512 Class 47s were built at Crewe Works and Brush's Falcon Works, Loughborough between 1962 and 1968, which made them the most numerous class of British mainline diesel locomotive.|$|E
5|$|The first Zephyr (9900) was {{completed}} by the Budd Company on April 9, 1934, powered by an eight-cylinder, 600-horsepower (447kW), 8-201-A model Winton engine. Like the <b>diesel-electric</b> locomotives that soon displaced the steam locomotive on American railroads, this engine powered an electrical generator; the electricity it generated was then fed to electric traction motors connected to the axles in the train's front truck.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of British Rail Class 201 <b>diesel-electric</b> multiple units to the Hastings route after 1957 and {{the completion of}} the electrification of the South Eastern Main Line in 1961 deprived the class of much of their work. Withdrawals began in January 1961 and the whole class had disappeared from service by December 1962.|$|E
5|$|A MaK-built DB Class 240 {{locomotive}} was test-run in Norway during 1990. On 23 November 1992, NSB's board {{decided to}} order ten similar units. The order was later expanded with another two units because NSB {{was offered a}} lower price than originally stipulated. The Di6 would have motors from Siemens, who had bought MaK, and would be optimized for Norwegian conditions and standards. The contract was worth NOK380 million, or NOK32 million per unit. At the same time, NSB also made an order for 20 smaller <b>diesel-electric</b> locomotives from MaK, the Di8. Between the two new classes, they were to replace all the Di3s.|$|E
5|$|Dieselisation {{occurred}} from 1951 {{with the}} F class shunter, but the B and S classes of 1952 and 1957 revolutionised main line operations. They were then {{followed by the}} T and Y classes in 1955 and 1963 which displaced steam from the branch lines and yards. Apart from the F class, Clyde Engineering has had a monopoly on Victorian <b>diesel-electric</b> locos. as the Australian licensee of General Motors EMD engines and traction motors, fitting them into locally designed bodies. By the 1980s the first generation locomotives were approaching {{the end of their}} lives, with the electric locomotives withdrawn by 1988, and the modern N and G classes allowing the withdrawal of lower power T and Y classes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, the Norwegian State Railways sought a new {{locomotive}} type to replace its aging fleet of Di 3 <b>diesel-electric</b> locomotives, which {{made up the}} back-bone of the dieselized operations. The new locomotives were planned for use as freight and passenger trains on the Nordland Line, {{and to a lesser}} extent on the Røros Line. In 1980, NSB had taken delivery of five Di4 from Henschel. Originally there were plans to order additional Di 4 units, but this was discarded and instead a new class was pursued, as NSB wanted similar, but slightly more modern, locomotives.|$|E
5|$|On its inauguration the Pennsylvanian {{ran with}} then-new Amfleet equipment: two coaches and a cafe. Today the Pennsylvanian {{continues}} {{to use an}} all-Amfleet consist {{although the number of}} coaches has grown to six. The train consists of an Amfleet I business class car, an Amfleet I cafe car, an Amfleet I coach, and three Amfleet II long-distance coach cars. Motive power is usually a Genesis <b>diesel-electric</b> locomotive west of Philadelphia. East of Philadelphia, the motive power is a Siemens ACS-64 electric locomotive; an engine swap is made at 30th Street Station in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|The Caltrain Modernization Program (CalMod) is a $1.9billion {{project that}} will add a {{positive}} train control (PTC) system and electrify {{the main line}} of the U.S. commuter railroad Caltrain, which serves cities in the San Francisco Peninsula and Silicon Valley, as well as transition from its current <b>diesel-electric</b> locomotive powered trains to electric multiple units (EMU). According to Caltrain, electrification of the tracks will allow it to improve service times via faster acceleration and shorter headways, reduce air pollution and noise, and facilitate a future railway tunnel (the Downtown Rail Extension) into downtown San Francisco's Transbay Transit Center (as diesel trains cannot serve underground stations).|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the submarine commenced in May 1983, when the government released a request for tender and approached seven of the world's nine <b>diesel-electric</b> submarine manufacturers for submissions. The submissions would be narrowed down to two based on the provided information, with these undergoing a funded study to determine the winning design. Tendering companies had to demonstrate how Australian industries would {{be incorporated into the}} project, and that they were willing to establish an Australia-based consortium to construct the submarines. All seven companies responded {{by the end of the}} year: the combined submissions totalling four tonnes (9,000lb) of paper.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 2014, {{there was}} {{increasing}} {{speculation that the}} Sōryū class (or a derivative) was the most likely candidate for the replacement. Defence technology sharing deals between Japan and Australia, along with the loosening of Japanese defence export restrictions, were seen as preliminary steps towards such a deal. The close personal relationship between the then-Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe was also cited {{as a factor in}} the likeliness of such a deal. In response to the rumours of the Japanese deal, unsolicited proposals were made by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (its Type 216 submarine concept), Saab (an enlarged version of the A26 submarine), and Thales and DCNS (a <b>diesel-electric</b> variant of the Barracuda-class submarine).|$|E
5|$|Triton {{was to be}} {{the lead}} ship of a {{proposed}} class of nuclear-powered radar picket submarines. A December 1955 long-range naval planning report envisioned five carrier strike groups, each supported by two radar picket submarines. The total force included two non-nuclear Sailfish class submarines and eight nuclear submarines. With construction costs for Triton escalating, this long-range requirement was revised in 1957 to provide four nuclear-powered radar picket submarines for a single nuclear-powered carrier group, with the four remaining conventionally powered carrier groups supported by two <b>diesel-electric</b> radar picket submarines each.|$|E
5|$|When {{the order}} was placed, {{it was the first}} Norwegian {{electric}} locomotive with the mechanical components built in Germany. At the same time, NSB ordered five six-axle <b>diesel-electric</b> locomotives from Thyssen-Henschel (Mark Di 4), almost the same as the Danish Mark ME 1500. The Di 4/ME 1500 have many similarities to its electric counterpart El 17. The two were planned to have the same rectifiers and motors, but due to weight restrictions the El 17 received the same type as Class 120.|$|E
5|$|The campus fare-free bus {{transit system}} began in 1990 and runs {{throughout}} {{the campus and}} surrounding neighborhoods. In 2005 the university started testing Hybrid buses on the service's main route. The first hybrid bus on the system used a proprietary <b>diesel-electric</b> propulsion system, known as a Hybrid Booster Drive (HBD), and {{was developed by the}} Electric Vehicle Institute (EVI) within the BGSU College of Technology. The system is made up of four routes. It includes major stops at various residence halls, academic buildings and athletic buildings. The campus has a phone application that allows the students to track the location of the different buses around campus. This application also gives an estimated time on the buses arrival to the bus stops.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} for {{a new type of}} submarine to replace the Oberon class of <b>diesel-electric</b> submarines began in July 1978, when the RAN director of submarine policy prepared a paper detailing the need to start considering a replacement for the ageing Oberons. The paper also raised the suggestion {{that the majority of the}} submarines be constructed in Australia and that the number of submarines be increased beyond the six Oberons. Building the submarines in Australia was initially met with reactions predicting an impossible task because of the poor state of the Australian shipbuilding industry, and Australian industry in general, although campaigning by several figures in Australian industry who thought it could be done came to the attention of those spearheading the project to design the Oberon-class replacement, and led to the view that it was both possible and feasible. The campaign to build submarines in Australia was also met with support from the Australian Labor Party and several trade unions.|$|E
5|$|The Porsche hull designs {{included}} a rear-mounted turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension {{was the same}} as on the Elefant tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired bogies sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive (fundamentally identical to a <b>Diesel-electric</b> transmission, only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the prime mover), similar to a gasoline-electric hybrid but without a storage battery; two separate drive trains in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; gasoline engine – electric generator – electric motor – drive sprocket. This method of propulsion had been attempted before on the Tiger (P) (later Elefant prototypes) and in some US designs, but had never been put into production. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later Jagdtiger tank destroyers. Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives. Dr. Porsche's unorthodox designs gathered little favour.|$|E
25|$|Diesel {{locomotives}} use {{a diesel}} engine {{as the prime}} mover. The energy transmission may be either <b>diesel-electric,</b> diesel-mechanical or diesel-hydraulic but <b>diesel-electric</b> is dominant. Electro-diesel locomotives are built to run as <b>diesel-electric</b> on unelectrified sections and as electric locomotives on electrified sections.|$|E
25|$|A hybrid {{electric}} bus {{combines a}} conventional {{internal combustion engine}} propulsion system with an electric propulsion system. These type of buses normally use a <b>Diesel-electric</b> powertrain and are also known as hybrid <b>Diesel-electric</b> buses.|$|E
25|$|NASA's huge Crawler-Transporters are <b>diesel-electric.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{the harsh}} winters of the 1950s showed that more modern icebreakers were needed, {{a series of}} {{slightly}} smaller <b>diesel-electric</b> icebreakers were built for operations within the archipelago. Karhu replaced Murtaja in 1958, the new Murtaja replaced Apu in 1959 and the new <b>diesel-electric</b> Sampo replaced the old steam-powered one in 1960.|$|E
25|$|A Victorian Railways <b>diesel-electric</b> locomotive, S311, {{is named}} after Mueller.|$|E
25|$|A common {{option on}} <b>diesel–electric</b> {{locomotives}} is dynamic (rheostatic) braking.|$|E
25|$|Mitsubishi Fuso Canter Eco Hybrid is a <b>diesel-electric</b> {{commercial}} truck.|$|E
25|$|So far, {{production}} <b>diesel-electric</b> engines {{have mostly}} appeared in mass transit buses.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, two ALCO RS-3 1,500 h.p. <b>diesel-electric</b> {{locomotives}} were purchased. With the {{phasing out}} of the steam power, by 1970 Jamaica's railways had fourteen <b>diesel-electric</b> locomotives and only one steam locomotive was still in operation. Between 1972 and 1976, an additional 18 ALCO RS-8's, manufactured by MLW in Canada, were purchased in three batches of six locomotives.|$|E
25|$|In August 2010, VIA Metropolitan Transit {{unveiled}} buses {{that are}} powered by <b>diesel-electric</b> hybrid technology.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, the Whyte {{notation}} of wheel {{arrangement was}} also {{often used for}} the classification of electric and <b>diesel-electric</b> locomotives with side-rod coupled driving wheels. Under the UIC classification, popular in Europe, this wheel arrangement is written as C if the wheels are coupled with rods or gears, or Co if they are independently driven, the latter usually being electric and <b>diesel-electric</b> locomotives.|$|E
