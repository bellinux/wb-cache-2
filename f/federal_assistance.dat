Allowable costs are those the federal government determines permissible for <b>federal</b> <b>assistance.</b> Unallowable costs are those the government prohibits incurring for <b>federal</b> <b>assistance.</b> Certain cost items are considered universally unallowable, such as cost related to illegal activities and lobbying costs, but others may be considered unallowable for a type of recipient while being allowable for another type of recipient. As a general rule, any assistance used inappropriately, such as incurring unallowable costs, requires reimbursement to the federal government.|$|E
40|$|Using National Family Business Panel data {{combined}} with national natural disaster and <b>federal</b> disaster <b>assistance</b> data, {{the purpose of}} the study was to investigate relative contributions of human, social and financial capital; natural disaster exposure; and <b>federal</b> disaster <b>assistance</b> to business-owning family resilience over time for male and female family business owners. With a theoretical foundation of Sustainable Family Business and Conservation of Resources theories, the study examined 311 small family firms from the National Family Business Panel. <b>Federal</b> disaster <b>assistance</b> explained a significant amount of variance in firm-owning resilience. Higher levels of <b>federal</b> disaster <b>assistance</b> were associated with lower family firm resilience for male-owned businesses and higher family firm resilience for female-owned businesses. This study advances knowledge of firm sustainability after natural disasters by adding to the conceptualization and measurement of family firm resilience; by having baseline firm financial data prior to disaster exposure; by utilizing a national, representative, longitudinal family firm sample; by including a range of natural disasters and federal disaster assistance; and by including family resilience over time.

5|$|This {{compliance}} requirement establishes {{that any}} non-federal recipient of <b>federal</b> <b>assistance</b> that passes that assistance, whether in part or in total, to another recipient (known as pass-through entities and subrecipients, respectively) {{is responsible to}} monitor the <b>federal</b> <b>assistance</b> activities of that subrecipient, as well as assure that they are both complying with laws and regulations. This requirement {{is based on the}} fact that they are both equally responsible for federal funds received. Subrecipient monitoring may consist of site visits, regular contact, interviews, meetings and examinations of the subrecipient, as well as requiring that the subrecipient be subject to an annual single audit.|$|E
5|$|This section {{covers the}} actual management, or handling, of funds {{pertaining}} {{to a federal}} program, specifically on how <b>federal</b> <b>assistance</b> is distributed to recipients and how recipients manage the funds until disbursement. The actual transfer of funds, {{commonly referred to as}} “drawdowns”, is usually done electronically by requesting the funds to the federal agency via website or a network. The funds are automatically transferred from the US Department of Treasury to the recipient’s bank account. <b>Federal</b> <b>assistance</b> for program operations is provided to recipients usually by one of two methods, also called “funding techniques”: by either advances of funds or by reimbursement of funds.|$|E
5|$|By {{four days}} after landfall, FEMA served around 68,000 meals to {{displaced}} families. More than a dozen disaster recovery centers were initiated throughout the state. FEMA provided 125,000 pounds of ice {{in the first few}} days, and prepared 200,000 pounds of ice and 180,000liters of water for the following week for the remaining communities without water. By six days after Isabel struck the state, all hospitals were opened and all roads excluding North Carolina Highway 12 were passable due to emergency crews clearing roads with debris. By about one month after the hurricane struck, 32,560 North Carolina residents applied for <b>federal</b> <b>assistance,</b> with disaster aid totaling about $50million (2003USD, ($ USD)). Subsequent disaster declarations ultimately declared 47 North Carolina counties as disaster areas.

5|$|On October1, President George W. Bush {{declared}} Puerto Rico {{major disaster}} area. The declaration allowed <b>federal</b> <b>assistance</b> to reach affected {{communities in the}} United States Commonwealth. Residents who met the requirements to receive federal aid were eligible for funding for temporary housing. People who lost their jobs due to the flooding were eligible for unemployment grants for 26 weeks starting {{the day of the}} disaster declaration. Residents were able to receive up to $200,000 for home damages; up to $40,000 in personal possession losses; and up to $2million for business losses. By October17, more than $5.6million in disaster aid was approved for 20,284 residences. Community Relations teams visited about 7,000 people. Out of the 4,140 small-business loans applications, only 288 were submitted by this time. By October25, the amount of funds nearly doubled, reaching $11million. At this time, more than, 24,500 residents applied for disaster loans. Survey teams checked over 18,000 homes for flood-related damages at this time also. Funding reached $16.5million by November7, with 29,000 people requesting <b>federal</b> <b>assistance.</b> By December5, funding for 37,000 residents reached $23.1million. At this time, the deadline for <b>federal</b> <b>assistance</b> requests was set for January15, 2009.

5|$|Flooding {{caused by}} Connie {{generally}} did not attract much media attention; however, the floods were important {{in setting the}} conditions for later significant flooding across the northeastern United States.

Diane produced further rainfall in already wet areas from Connie. Damage from Diane totaled at least $700million, and six states were declared federal disaster areas from the combined hurricanes' impact; this allowed <b>federal</b> <b>assistance</b> for the affected areas.|$|E

5|$|Matching, also {{referred}} to as “cost sharing”, is a requirement for the recipient to provide contributions or donations (usually non-federal) of a specified amount or percentage to supplement <b>federal</b> <b>assistance</b> received. In other words, when the recipient participates in a federal program (e.g. it receives <b>federal</b> <b>assistance)</b> and an operating budget is prepared, the federal government may require the recipient to provide contributions to cover a portion of that program’s operations. The matching requirement is based on the assertion that total program expenses are 100% and that, although the federal government provides assistance for most of those expenses, the recipient must still cover a portion of them. Such proportion is solely decided by the federal government, but usually the recipient decides how that contribution is provided and to which expenses, so long as the contribution is verifiable, generally does not originate from another federal program, and is considered in the operating budget. The expenses must be necessary and reasonable, allowed under cost principles (see B section above), and not used for another federal program. Matching may be in the form of contributing the recipient’s own funds or money to suffrage program allowable costs (e.g., paying program utility bills, paying part of program personnel payroll, etc.) or, in some cases, in the form of in-kind contributions, which are donations of non-monetary objects such as services, materials, property, etc.|$|E
