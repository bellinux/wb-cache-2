5|$|Amanita muscaria is a {{cosmopolitan}} mushroom, native to conifer and deciduous woodlands throughout the temperate and boreal {{regions of the}} Northern Hemisphere, including higher elevations of warmer latitudes in regions such as Hindu Kush, the Mediterranean and also Central America.

The season for fruiting varies in different climates: fruiting occurs in summer and autumn across most of North America, but later in autumn and early winter on the Pacific coast. This species is often found in similar locations to Boletus edulis, and may appear in fairy rings. Conveyed with pine seedlings, it has been widely transported into the southern hemisphere, including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and South America, {{where it can be}} found in the southern Brazilian states of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul.|$|E

5|$|Business writer Megan Barnett {{has pointed}} out {{parallels}} between Dunder Mifflin and the real-life W.B. Mason paper company, based near Boston, in Brockton, Massachusetts. It is similarly regional in focus, serving corporate customers in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. Like Dunder Mifflin, its original product line (rubber stamps) was something other than paper, and it faces stiff competition from national and international chains. It, too, has a branch office in Stamford, but Mason's has remained open.

5|$|Contrary to Miyamoto's design {{mentality of}} {{creating}} the gameplay system first, development started out with the scenario writing, which Flagship was in charge of. Some of the staff members, the team led by director and designer Hidemaro Fujibayashi that was responsible for tasks other than the storyline, wanted to skip the remake and create an original Zelda title right away. As the first installment in the series was deemed too difficult for {{the new generation of}} players, more and more changes were applied to the point where <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> entirely different world map. As a result, the team ran into problems because the scenario and the maps had to be reworked constantly to make all the modifications match. The Game Boy Color's screen presented an additional hurdle when attempting to rework the earlier Zelda title as it is narrower than that of a television; players could not view an entire room without scrolling which made it easy to overlook stairways or clues on walls.|$|E
