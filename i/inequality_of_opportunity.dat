This study relies on regression analysis and proposed several measures <b>of</b> <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Data from the Retrospective Survey of SHARELIFE, which focuses on life histories of European people aged 50 and over, are used. In Europe at the whole, inequalities in opportunities stand for almost 50 % <b>of</b> the health <b>inequality</b> due to circumstances and efforts in Barry scenario and 57. 5 % in Roemer scenario. The comparison of the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>inequalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> in health across European countries shows considerable inequalities in Austria, France, Spain, Germany, whereas Sweden,Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland present the lowest <b>inequalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunities.</b> The normative principle {{on the way to}} treat the correlation betweencircumstances and effort makes little difference in Spain, Austria, Greece, France, Czech Republic, Sweden and Switzerland whereas it would matter the most in Belgium, theNetherlands, Italy, Germany, Poland and Denmark.

The comparison of the odds ratios associated with family background without and with adjustment for individual educational level and occupation allows assessing the direct influence of family background and its influence through the determination of individual social status.

As an interim policy, it has achieved its objective, and now is the time for adjusting the policy.” Research from the World Bank indicates that while inequality of income can be inevitable at certain stages of development, <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> will undermine long-term development prospects.

5000|$|A good {{indicator}} of social mobility is opportunity and equality of education, as {{statistics show that}} there is a direct correlation between education level and income. The Government of South Africa has made massive investments in education. However, when examined more closely, it was found that these investments in education benefit the wealthiest of South Africans the most, and do very little to help the poor communities. [...] Tests conducted in South African schools showed that 27% of 6th grade students in South Africa are illiterate. However, when schools are separated by regional wealth that number drops to just 4%, revealing a stark contrast between education for the rich and poor. Because of this large <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity,</b> it is difficult for a poor South Africans to raise themselves out of poverty. Though the opportunity exists, the chances are much lower for a poor South African to receive opportunity than a rich South African, revealing a trend of little social mobility. Some scholars argue that this lack of social mobility for the nations poor is further fostered by government funded housing. [...] Since its transition to democracy, the South African government has made large investments in government funded housing. [...] These government run housing projects are located in areas that receive the least amount of funding for education and welfare, ensuring that the uneducated and poor will remain uneducated and poor. A level of social mobility does exist among blacks who are able to attend schools in white areas, but with 76% of the total population being black combined with massive regional grouping of blacks, white schools are few and far between, and inaccessible to the poor.|$|E
50|$|Roemer's work on {{exploitation}} led him {{to believe}} that the fundamental cause of exploitation was inequality of ownership of productive assets, rather than the kind of oppression that occurs in the labor process at the point of production—the latter view was held by many in the 'New Left' (see, e.g., Braverman 1974). While writing A General Theory of Exploitation and Class (1982), Roemer met the philosopher Gerald Cohen and the political theorist Jon Elster: they and others had formed a group of like-minded Marxists, young social scientists and philosophers who saw their task as reconstructing Marxism on solid analytical foundations, using modern techniques. Roemer joined this group in 1981. He was strongly influenced by Cohen, whose work Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence (1978) was to become the gold standard of analytical Marxism. Having decided that inequality of asset ownership was the key culprit in capitalist inequality, Roemer, under Cohen's influence, began reading philosophical work on equality. He was impressed with Ronald Dworkin's (1981a, 1981b) writings, advocating a kind of resource egalitarianism. But in Roemer (1985), he showed that the hypothetical insurance market which Dworkin postulated to take place behind a veil of ignorance did not suffice to compensate those with a poor endowment of natural talents or bad luck in the birth lottery, as Dworkin had intended. In fact, pathologically, Dworkin's insurance market could transfer wealth from disabled to able persons. Influenced as well by Richard Arneson's (1989) proposal, Roemer (1993) proposed a conception of equality of opportunity, which attempted to carry out Dworkin's and Arneson's program—that is, to compensate persons for bad luck in the birth lottery, but to hold them responsible for their choices, or effort. He expanded this theory in Roemer (1996, 1998, 2012), where he proposed an algorithm whereby a society could equalize opportunities for a given objective (wage earning capacity, income, health), consonant with its own view of what factors individuals should be held responsible for, and what factors demanded compensation. Roemer and collaborators have produced a number of applications of this approach (Roemer et al. 2001; Llavador and Roemer 2001; Betts and Roemer 2007; Keane and Roemer 2009; Bjorkund, Jantti, and Roemer 2012).
