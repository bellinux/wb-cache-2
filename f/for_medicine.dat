5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the century, {{scholastic}} Greek organizations appeared on grounds. The university chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was founded in 1908, promoting scholarship in all fields of study. Different schools had specific honor and professional societies as well: Phi Delta Phi for the law department, Phi Rho Sigma <b>for</b> <b>medicine,</b> Kappa Delta Mu for chemistry, and many others. A chapter of Theta Tau, an engineering society, was founded in 1923, and Trigon Engineering Society was founded in 1924 as a local fraternity for engineering students. Trigon and Theta Tau dominated student government in the Engineering School during this time, often fielding competing candidates for student office. Likewise in the College, the University Party and the Cavalier Party were dominated by Lambda Pi and Skull & Keys, two Greek organizations.|$|E
5|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the navy, army, and local government devised a cleanup plan. Three hundred government employees (with guidance of the military) worked to clear debris. They quickly restored water and power service, and within a few days streets had been cleaned for most of the impacted area. Authorities in Manzanillo asked <b>for</b> <b>medicine,</b> clothing and food from nearby areas while the red cross treated the injured. Many of the displaced were evacuated to government offices. Within {{a few days after the}} storm, the ports of Manzanillo, Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Lazaro Cardenas were reopened. The remnants of the storm later brought rain to the Rockie Mountains and the Southwestern United States. Eugene is one of three known July Pacific hurricane strikes, where hurricane-force winds are estimated over land.

5|$|On March20, the {{government}} of Madagascar appealed {{to the international community}} for assistance, due to the heavy damage from the cyclone. In response to the request, various governments and international organizations provided assistance to Madagascar, including $490,000 from the European Economic Community for food and blankets, as well as $125,000 from UNICEF <b>for</b> <b>medicine</b> and building supplies. Catholic Relief Services donated clothing, rice, and milk from Caritas Madagascar. Countries that provided assistance included China, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, West Germany, Holy See, Mauritius, Canada, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Soviet Union, and Switzerland. Collectively, the international community provided $3.37million worth of aid to Madagascar. The United States Pacific Command flew from the Philippines to Madagascar to deliver medicine. The nation had earlier helped Madagascar recover from Cyclone Kamisy in 1984 with housing rebuilding projects, and transferred materials due to the impacts from Honorinina to the Toamasina area. The Malagasy government also set up a National Relief Committee to facilitate relief efforts, including an initial inspection of the affected area to determine needs. Workers delivered about 19tons of material to Toamasina and nearby Brickaville, including milk, blankets, and clothing. The World Bank estimated the cost for repairing commercial areas would be over $27million (1986USD). The agency also allocated funds toward repairing damaged power facilities, ports, roads, and airports. The International Monetary Fund also approved a $37.8million loan to the country in 1986, half of which for emergency aid. Many houses and buildings had to be closed for repairs due to flood damage, including hotels, churches, and schools.|$|E
5|$|The CIA and the Democratic Revolutionary Front had based a 1,400-strong army, Brigade 2506, in Nicaragua. On {{the night}} of April 16 to 17, Brigade 2506 landed along Cuba's Bay of Pigs, and engaged in a firefight with a local revolutionary militia. Castro ordered Captain José Ramón Fernández to launch the counter-offensive, before taking {{personal}} control of it. After bombing the invaders' ships and bringing in reinforcements, Castro forced the Brigade to surrender on April 20. He ordered the 1189 captured rebels to be interrogated {{by a panel of}} journalists on live television, personally taking over the questioning on April 25. 14 were put on trial for crimes allegedly committed before the revolution, while the others were returned to the U.S. in exchange <b>for</b> <b>medicine</b> and food valued at U.S. $25 million. Castro's victory was a powerful symbol across Latin America, but it also increased internal opposition primarily among the middle-class Cubans who had been detained {{in the run-up to the}} invasion. Although most were freed within a few days, many fled to the U.S., establishing themselves in Florida.|$|E
