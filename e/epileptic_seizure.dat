40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the frequency and}} risk factors of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> in a large cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: Five hundred nineteen consecutive patients with SLE were studied, with follow-up ranging from 4 to 7. 8 years. The type and frequency of risk factors associated with acute and recurrent <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> in SLE were determined. Results: Sixty (11. 6 %) patients with <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> were identified. <b>Epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> occurred {{at the onset of}} SLE symptoms in 19 (31. 6 %) and after the onset of SLE in 41 of 60 (68. 3 %) patients. Fifty-three of 60 (88. 3 %) patients had acute symptomatic <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures,</b> and 7 of 60 (11. 7 %) had recurrent <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures.</b> Variables associated with acute <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> at SLE onset were stroke (p= 0. 0004) and antiphospholipid antibodies (p= 0. 0013). <b>Epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> during follow-up were related to nephritis (p= 0. 001), antiphospholipid antibodies (p= 0. 005), and <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> at disease onset (p= 0. 00001). All seven patients who presented recurrent <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> had antiphospholipid syndrome and interictal epileptic abnormalities on EEG. Conclusions: <b>Epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> were observed in 11. 2 % of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Antiphospholipid antibodies and stroke were related to <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> at SLE disease onset. Patients with renal flares, <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> at SLE disease onset, and antiphospholipid antibodies were at greater risk for acute symptomatic seizures during follow-up. Recurrence of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> occurred in 1. 3 % of patients and was associated with antiphospholipid syndrome...|$|R

40|$|Brain-injured {{patients}} can experience <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> beyond 1  week from injury (unprovoked remote symptomatic <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures).</b> In our longitudinal observational study, we analysed occurrence of unprovoked remote <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> and interictal epileptiform activity in 130 traumatic, vascular or anoxic inpatients with disorders of consciousness (DOC), with a clinical diagnosis of vegetative state (n =  97) or minimally conscious state (n =  33). We also investigated impact of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> and epileptiform activity on clinical outcome (30  months post-onset). <b>Epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> occurred in 35 / 130 patients (26. 9  %), epileptiform activity in 61 / 130 (46. 9  %) patients, without significant differences related to clinical diagnosis or aetiology. Among patients with epileptiform activity, only 26 / 61 (42. 6  %) developed clinically evident seizures. Mortality at 30  months {{was not significantly}} influenced {{by the presence of}} seizures or epileptiform activity. The proportion of patients who recovered at long-term follow-up was higher in patients without than in patients with <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures,</b> but was similar in patients with or without epileptiform activity. The presence of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> but not of epileptiform activity, significantly affected the level of responsiveness at final outcome. In conclusion, seizures were detected in about one third of the whole sample, and in about a half of patients with epileptiform activity, regardless of clinical diagnosis or aetiology. Although <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> or epileptiform activity did not significantly affect mortality rate, we demonstrated that <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> could hamper recovery of consciousness. <b>Epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> thus qualify as one of the factors largely undetermined at the moment which can influence prognosis in DOC patients...|$|R
5|$|An {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) {{can assist}} in showing brain activity suggestive of {{an increased risk of}} seizures. It is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizure</b> on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present. In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure. It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the disease. In certain situations it may be useful to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the classification of seizures which focuses on what happens during a seizure, the classification of epilepsies focuses on the underlying causes.

The name of the diagnosis finally made depends on the available diagnostic results and the applied definitions and classifications (of seizures and epilepsies) and its respective terminology.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Purpose: Some {{patients}} with nonconvulsive status epilepticus {{are known to}} exhibit catatonic stupor. Thus {{it is necessary to}} rule out ictal catatonia by electroencephalography in {{patients with}} catatonic stupor. However, few reports are available on <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> superimposed on catatonic stupor. Methods: We report three cases of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> superimposed on psychiatric catatonic stupor without a prominent predisposing factor, including high fever or encephalitis. None of the patients had a personal or family history of neurologic disease, including epilepsy. Results: In all three patients, catatonic stupor persisted after resolution of the <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> with administration of phenytoin. In two of the three patients, catatonic stupor resolved with electroconvulsive therapy, which caused no marked adverse effects. Conclusions: Because it is possible that catatonic stupor itself predisposes patients to the development of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures,</b> electroencephalographic examinations in patients with catatonic stupor are indispensable for early recognition not only of nonconvulsive status epilepticus but also of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> superimposed on catatonic stupor. Electroconvulsive therapy deserves consideration when catatonic stupor persists after resolution of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures...</b>|$|R

5|$|The oldest {{medical records}} show that {{epilepsy}} has been affecting people {{at least since the}} beginning of recorded history. Throughout ancient history, the disease was thought to be a spiritual condition. The world's oldest description of an <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizure</b> comes from a text in Akkadian (a language used in ancient Mesopotamia) and was written around 2000 BC. The person described in the text was diagnosed as being under the influence of a Moon god, and underwent an exorcism. Epileptic seizures are listed in the Code of Hammurabi (c. 1790 BC) as reason for which a purchased slave may be returned for a refund, and the Edwin Smith Papyrus (c. 1700 BC) describes cases of individuals with epileptic convulsions.|$|E

5|$|As a {{side effect}} of the {{electrochemical}} processes used by neurons for signaling, brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active. When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull, using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). EEG recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active, even during sleep. Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep, faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task. During an <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizure,</b> the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain. Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology.|$|E

40|$|Epilepsy is {{a common}} {{neurological}} disorder; however, in Nigeria and other tropical regions, the causes of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> differ greatly in etiology. This paper {{is an attempt to}} highlight some possible microbiological aspects of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures.</b> A literature review was carried out to identify the extent to which microbial infections were involved in the elicitation of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures.</b> Data were collected from several clinics in the community and hospitals in Nigeria and correlated with the evidence from the literature review. It was found that different microbial agents including viral, bacterial, protozoa, and fungal agents were involved in several aspects of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures.</b> Malaria was found to cause more than 88 % of childhood <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> and 12 % of adult seizures. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurred in more than 40 % of adult patients. Partial seizures were uncommon. Cases of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> associated with bacteria (e. g., brucellosis), viral, fungal, and protozoa infections were frequently reported. Malaria, tapeworm, and cysticercosis were some of the common infectious causes of epilepsy; however, in some cases, the cause remained unknown. From these findings, it was evident that microbiological aspects of epilepsies are possible research areas that might be developed. It is believed that the unraveling of the various microbiological factors in <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> would have important implications for understanding the underlying neurobiology, evaluating treatment strategies, and perhaps planning health-care resources for the affected. It will also help to improve the prognostic factors in initial seizure symptomatic etiology and presence of any structural cerebral abnormalities...|$|R
