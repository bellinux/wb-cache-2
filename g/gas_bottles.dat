25|$|On 21 October 2016, 27 {{people were}} injured, {{two of them}} seriously, when a tear gas {{substance}} was released in London City Airport. Hundreds of other passengers reported experiencing temporary blindness and itching. Many flights were cancelled, leaving thousands stranded and causing major disruption around Europe. A few days later, police arrested a suspect under 'terror offences' and the media referred to the incident as a terror attack. Police later confirmed that tear <b>gas</b> <b>bottles</b> had deliberately been placed to 'cause harm or disruption'. Security was increased {{at the airport in}} the days following the attack.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to increase the gas volume of the accumulator by coupling a <b>gas</b> <b>bottle</b> to the <b>gas</b> side of the accumulator. This is mainly done since a <b>gas</b> <b>bottle</b> normally is cheaper to produce than an accumulator.|$|R

25|$|The TAIC {{released}} its interim {{report on the}} accident on 10 May 2012. Examination of the wreckage showed electrical arcing on the basket {{and one of the}} four propane cylinders, consistent with a power line strike. Details about the maintenance and record-keeping of the balloon were released. The most recent inspection had occurred on 14 September 2011, with several errors made in the records and inspection. The inspection report erroneously recorded the type certificate as B2GL, which is applicable to Cameron Balloons United States for serial numbers 5000 and higher – ZK-XXF was manufactured in the United Kingdom and was serial number 4300, so the correct type certificate was BB12. It also recorded the basket and burners as being of Cameron Balloons, not as being of Thunder and Colt. Anomalies were also identified in the maintenance logbook, including incorrect identification of the basket and burners, no record of four airworthiness directives, and no entry regarding the use of the <b>gas</b> <b>bottles.</b> The maintenance provider was also found to be using outdated versions of the Flight and Maintenance Manuals, using the 1992-released Issue 7 rather than the current Issue 10, and that the maintainers had tested the strength of the envelope by hand, rather than the prescribed method of using a spring gauge to measure actual strength.|$|E

2500|$|Oxygen from <b>gas</b> <b>bottles</b> or liquid {{containers}} can {{be applied}} directly via a nasal cannula or mask. Oxygen concentrators based upon pressure swing adsorption (PSA), VSA, or vacuum-pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) {{can be used to}} generate the oxygen if electricity is available. Stationary oxygen concentrators typically use PSA technology, which has performance degradations at the lower barometric pressures at high altitudes. One way to compensate for the performance degradation is to utilize a concentrator with more flow capacity. There are also portable oxygen concentrators that can be used on vehicular DC power or on internal batteries, and at least one system commercially available measures and compensates for the altitude effect on its performance up to [...] The application of high-purity oxygen from one of these methods increases the partial pressure of oxygen by raising the FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen).|$|E

2500|$|Eyewitnesses saw {{the balloon}} climb and drift east towards a ten-metre high 33,000-volt power line running {{perpendicular}} to the road, {{one of the two}} lines that connected the Clareville zone substation, which supplied Carterton and the surrounding rural area, to the national grid at Transpower's Masterton substation. The pilot was heard shouting [...] "duck down" [...] as the balloon came in contact with the power line around 85metres from the road. One of the conductor wires was caught {{over the top of the}} pilot's end of the basket, and the pilot attempted to get the balloon to climb, but the tension of the wire prevented it rising and instead the balloon slid along the conductor. Around 20 seconds later, electrical arcing occurred as the balloon caused a phase-to-phase short circuit, tripping the line and causing the 3800 properties supplied by the Clareville zone substation to lose power. The arcing caused one of the four liquefied petroleum <b>gas</b> <b>bottles</b> supplying the burners to rupture, and a fire subsequently started.|$|E

30|$|In our system, the {{gas from}} the {{upstream}} pore fluid reservoir is allowed to evacuate to ambient laboratory conditions, thus V_d is infinite and P_d is equal to atmospheric pressure. To perform such measurements, we first maintain P_u is at a constant pressure of 0.2  MPa using a <b>gas</b> <b>bottle</b> for at least 1  h; this allows for complete pore fluid saturation of the sample. The upstream pore fluid reservoir is then isolated from the <b>gas</b> <b>bottle</b> using a valve and P_u is allowed to decay from this fixed volume, V_u, to ambient laboratory conditions.|$|R
