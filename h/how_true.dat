5|$|The second epoch saw the reigns of {{the last}} three legendary kings. The second epoch was more {{consequential}} than was the first, which was in part due to the significant degree of territorial expansion which occurred during this period. Regardless of <b>how</b> <b>true</b> these legends were, it is likely that, as the legends suggest, a series of conquests did occur during the late monarchy. As a result of these conquests, it became necessary to determine what was to be done with the conquered people. Often, individuals whose towns had been conquered remained in those towns, while other such individuals came to Rome. To acquire legal and economic standing, these newcomers adopted a condition of dependency toward either a Patrician family, or toward the king. Eventually, the individuals who were dependents of the king were released from their state of dependency, and became the first Plebeians. As Rome grew, it needed more soldiers to continue its conquests. When the Plebeians were released from their dependency, they were released from their Curia. When this occurred, while they were no longer required to serve in the army, they also lost their political and economic standing. To bring these new Plebeians back into the army, the Patricians were forced to make concessions. While it is not known exactly what concessions were made, {{the fact that they were}} not granted any political power set the stage for what history knows as the Conflict of the Orders.|$|E

25|$|The Serpent Mound {{may have}} been {{designed}} {{in accord with the}} pattern of stars composing the constellation Draco. The star pattern of the constellation Draco fits with fair precision to the Serpent Mound, with the ancient Pole Star, Thuban (α Draconis), at its geographical center within the first of seven coils from the head. The fact that the body of Serpent Mound follows the pattern of Draco may support various theses. Putnam's 1865 refurbishment of the earthwork could have been correctly accomplished in that a comparison of Romain's or Fletcher and Cameron's maps from the 1980s show how the margins of the Serpent align with great accuracy to a large portion of Draco. Some researchers date the earthwork to around 5,000 years ago, based on the position of Draco, through the backward motion of precessionary circle of the ecliptic when Thuban was the Pole Star. Alignment of the effigy to the Pole Star at that position also shows <b>how</b> <b>true</b> north {{may have been}} found. This was not known until 1987 because lodestone and modern compasses give incorrect readings at the site.|$|E

500|$|Erica Wexler from Spin {{described}} Madonna on {{the cover}} as [...] "like a cobra basking in the hot sun, Madonna {{on the cover}} of her new album stretches her profile lasciviously." [...] Author J. Randy Taraborrelli commented in , that the album cover indicated <b>how</b> <b>True</b> Blue was a vehicle of growth for Madonna. He felt that the [...] "washed out color photograph" [...] of her with head tilted back and eyes closed was [...] "understated", especially when compared to the sexier poses she had been associated in the past. The album's inner sleeve did not feature any photographs, and instead was dedicated to album credits and the song lyrics, since Madonna wanted to be represented by her songs on True Blue, not her image. Billboard listed the cover at rank 34 on their article about the [...] "50 Greatest Album Covers", describing it as a striking image of the singer.|$|E
500|$|... "Bop Gun" [...] {{marked the}} first episode in its new time slot on Thursdays at 10 p.m., occupying a period {{previously}} filled by L.A. Law. The show previously aired 9 p.m. on Wednesdays, where it was regularly defeated in the ratings by the ABC comedy Home Improvement. [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was written by David Mills and David Simon based on a story by Fontana. It was directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal, a feature director then-best known for such films as Waterland (1992) and A Dangerous Woman (1993). It was the first television script written by Mills, who previously worked as a reporter and became friends with Simon while studying journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park. Mills said of [...] "Bop Gun", [...] "That script inspired me to quit journalism. It was a golden opportunity, even though I didn't know what I was doing. I developed bad habits as a newspaper feature writer. I would always stretch a project to fill the available time." [...] "Bop Gun" [...] served as a departure from previous Homicide: Life on the Street episodes by focusing more strongly on a murder victim, {{rather than on the}} detectives. Simon felt the script's dialogue, particularly the detectives' use of dark humor as a coping mechanism for dealing with the horrors of the homicide unit, were faithful to reality. He particularly cited the scene in which Felton angers Ellison by talking excitedly about how much overtime he expected to get. Simon said, [...] "That's a conversation that would happen. It would happen in any homicide unit in America, and when I saw it actually being acted out I got a real kick in the pants because I thought, 'Wherever there are homicide detectives watching this, they're cracking up because they know <b>how</b> <b>true</b> it is.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Urkowitz is {{not alone}} in finding {{evidence}} to support the early draft theory.

The argument is that this difference cannot be accounted for by faulty reporting, and instead must represent revision on Shakespeare's part; [...] "The nature of the differences between True Tragedy and 3 Henry VI in terms of factual details, diction, and interpretive commentary by Hall and Holinshed reasonably suggests a direction of change, as well as the presence of an informed agency at work in revising the play reported by True Tragedy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Borlaug {{continually}} advocated increasing {{crop yields}} {{as a means}} to curb deforestation. The large role he played in both increasing crop yields and promoting this view has led to this methodology being called by agricultural economists the [...] "Borlaug hypothesis", namely that increasing the productivity of agriculture on the best farmland can help control deforestation by reducing the demand for new farmland. According to this view, assuming that global food demand is on the rise, restricting crop usage to traditional low-yield methods would also require {{at least one of the}} following: the world population to decrease, either voluntarily or as a result of mass starvations; or the conversion of forest land into crop land. It is thus argued that high-yield techniques are ultimately saving ecosystems from destruction. On a global scale, this view holds strictly true ceteris paribus, if deforestation only occurs to increase land for agriculture. But other land uses exist, such as urban areas, pasture, or fallow, so further research is necessary to ascertain what land has been converted for what purposes, to determine <b>how</b> <b>true</b> this view remains. Increased profits from high-yield production may also induce cropland expansion in any case, although as world food needs decrease, this expansion may decrease as well.|$|E
2500|$|Points {{are awarded}} for {{permitted}} techniques {{delivered to the}} legal scoring areas, {{as determined by the}} electronic scoring system, which assesses the strength and location of the contact. The only techniques allowed are kicks (delivering a strike using an area of the foot below the ankle) and punches (delivering a strike using the closed fist). In some smaller tournaments, and in the past, points were awarded by three corner judges using electronic scoring tallies. All major national and international tournaments have moved fully (as of 2017) to electronic scoring, including the use of electronic headgear. This limits corner judges to scoring only technical points and punches. Some believe that the new electronic scoring system reduces controversy concerning judging decisions, but this technology is still not universally accepted. In particular the move to electronic headgear has replaced controversy over judging with controversy over how the technology has changed the sport. Because the headgear is not able to determine if a kick was a correct taekwondo technique, and the pressure threshold for sensor activation for headgear is kept low for safety reasons, athletes who improvised ways of placing their foot on their opponents head were able to score points, regardless of <b>how</b> <b>true</b> to taekwondo those techniques were.|$|E
