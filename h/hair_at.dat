5|$|On Athas, {{the planet}} of the Dark Sun {{campaign}} setting, dwarves stand less than 5' tall and weigh nearly 200lbs. Each dwarf pursues a singular obsession, called a focus, that requires {{at least a week}} to complete. Athasian dwarves do not live underground, but some communities focus on unearthing long-lost dwarven strongholds. Physically, the dwarves of Athas are unique among their kind, having no <b>hair</b> <b>at</b> all. Athasian dwarves can breed with humans to produce muls, who are sterile offsprings that share the strength and resiliency of dwarves with the size of humans.|$|E
5|$|Seiderman {{worked with}} Charles Wright on the wigs. These went over a {{flexible}} skull cover that Seiderman created and sewed into place with elastic thread. When {{he found the}} wigs too full he untied one <b>hair</b> <b>at</b> a time to alter their shape. Kane's mustache was inserted into the makeup surface a few hairs at a time, to realistically vary the color and texture.|$|E
5|$|Barrowman's {{professional}} {{acting career}} began in London's West End in 1989, {{playing the role}} of Billy Crocker in Cole Porter's Anything Goes at the Prince Edward Theatre, alongside Elaine Paige as Reno Sweeney and Bernard Cribbins as Moonface Martin. He continued to appear in West End productions for the next decade, taking the title role of Domingo Hernandez in Matador at the Queen's Theatre in 1991; as Raoul in The Phantom of the Opera at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1992; as Claude in <b>Hair</b> <b>at</b> the Old Vic Theatre in 1993; as Chris in Miss Saigon at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1993; as Joe Gillis in Sunset Boulevard at the Adelphi Theatre from 1994–1995; and as Beast in Beauty and the Beast at the Dominion Theatre in 1999.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, the Reprise! theatre {{company in}} Los Angeles {{performed}} <b>Hair</b> <b>at</b> the Wadsworth Theatre, starring Steven Weber as Berger, Sam Harris as Claude and Jennifer Leigh Warren as Sheila. That same year, Encores! Great American Musicals in Concert ended its 2001 City Center {{season with a}} production of Hair starring Luther Creek, Idina Menzel and Tom Plotkin, and featuring Hair composer Galt MacDermot on stage playing the keyboards. An Actors' Fund benefit of the show was performed for onenight at the New Amsterdam Theater in New York City in 2004. The Tribe included Shoshana Bean, Raul Esparza, Jim J. Bullock, Liz Callaway, Gavin Creel, Eden Espinosa, Harvey Fierstein, Ana Gasteyer, Annie Golden, Jennifer Hudson, Julia Murney, Jai Rodriguez, RuPaul, Michael McKean, Laura Benanti and Adam Pascal.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi is a {{medium-sized}} oryzomyine with small ears and large feet, and {{is similar to}} the marsh rice rat in general appearance. The long and coarse fur is brownish above and ochraceous below. At the base of the tail, the upper and lower sides differ in color and at the end is a short tuft of hairs. The scales on the tail are well-developed. As in other Oryzomys, the hindfeet exhibit specializations for life in the water. The plantar (lower) surface of the metatarsus is naked. Two of the pads are very small. Ungual tufts, tufts of <b>hair</b> <b>at</b> the bases of the claws, are poorly developed. Interdigital webbing is present, but extends along {{less than half of the}} first phalanges.|$|E
5|$|Two thick {{folds of}} skin {{encircle}} the body {{behind the front}} legs and before the hind legs. The rhino has a smaller fold of skin around its neck. The skin itself is thin, , and in the wild, the rhino appears to have no subcutaneous fat. Hair can range from dense (the most dense hair in young calves) to scarce, and is usually a reddish brown. In the wild, this hair is hard to observe because the rhinos are often covered in mud. In captivity, however, the hair grows out and becomes much shaggier, likely because of less abrasion from walking through vegetation. The rhino has a patch of long hair around its ears and a thick clump of <b>hair</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of its}} tail. Like all rhinos, they have very poor vision. The Sumatran rhinoceros is fast and agile; it climbs mountains easily and comfortably traverses steep slopes and riverbanks.|$|E

25|$|Classic male-pattern {{hair loss}} begins above the temples and vertex (calvaria) of the scalp. As it progresses, a rim of <b>hair</b> <b>at</b> {{the sides and}} rear of the head remains. This has been {{referred}} to as a 'Hippocratic wreath', and rarely progresses to complete baldness. The Hamilton-Norwood scale has been developed to grade androgenic alopecia in males.|$|E

25|$|To {{eliminate}} Faizani's {{strong influence}} among the upper echelons of Afghan society (especially among the military elites), in 1973 President Daoud of Afghanistan and his Communist advisors accused the Hizb-i Tawheed of organizing a coup d'etat. This accusation {{led to the}} final imprisonment of Faizani and hundreds of his disciples. It was during this last imprisonment that he suffered the cruelest tortures, including having his beard plucked out one <b>hair</b> <b>at</b> a time, being continually whipped, electrocuted, and having his teeth crushed.|$|E
50|$|In mammals, ungual tufts are {{tufts of}} <b>hairs</b> <b>at</b> {{the base of}} claws of the fore- and hindfeet. Their {{presence}} {{has been used as}} a character in cladistic studies of Cricetidae.|$|R

At dinner with a friend, a woman named Poppy Stirling mentions something called the Pale Horse that arranges deaths, but is suddenly scared at having mentioned it and will say no more.|$|E
25|$|After being no-balled Muralitharan bowled {{a further}} 32 overs from umpire Steve Dunne's end without protest from either Dunne or <b>Hair,</b> <b>at</b> square leg. The Sri Lankan camp was outraged after the incident, but the ICC defended Hair, {{outlining}} {{a list of}} steps they had taken {{in the past to}} determine, without result, the legitimacy of Muralitharan's action. By calling Muralitharan from the bowlers' end Hair overrode what is normally regarded as the authority of the square leg umpire in adjudicating on throwing. Dunne would have had to break convention to support his partner.|$|E
25|$|Immediate {{preparation}} for a mikveh includes a bath or shower wherein {{every part of the}} body (including the ears and underneath the nails) is thoroughly washed; plus other routine hygiene practices which include trimming fingernails and toenails, brushing and flossing the teeth, and combing the <b>hair.</b> <b>At</b> the mikvah itself, a female attendant is present to make certain that the woman immerses herself fully, including her hairs. Though that is the attendant's foremost duty, she may also help by checking a woman's back or answer questions regarding proper ritual protocol.|$|E

25|$|Four {{recognised}} species infect cattle: S. bovifelis, S. bovihominis (S. hominis) S. cruzi (S. bovicanis) and S. hirsuta. S. cruzi is {{the only}} species known to be pathogenic in cattle. A number of clinical syndromes {{have been reported in}} connection with this parasite: eosinophilic myositis; abortions, stillbirths and deaths in pregnant cows; two cases of necrotic encephalitis in heifers have also been reported. Typical clinical signs of acute bovine sarcocystosis are: anorexia, pyrexia (42C or more), anemia, cachexia, enlarged palpable lymph nodes, excessive salivation and loss of <b>hair</b> <b>at</b> the tip of the tail.|$|E
25|$|The hairy ball theorem of {{algebraic}} topology (sometimes called the hedgehog theorem in Europe) states {{that there is}} no nonvanishing continuous tangent vector field on even-dimensional n-spheres. For the ordinary sphere, or 2‑sphere, if f is a continuous function that assigns a vector in R3 to every point p on a sphere such that f(p) is always tangent to the sphere at p, then {{there is at least one}} p such that f(p) = 0. In other words, whenever one attempts to comb a hairy ball flat, there will always be at least one tuft of <b>hair</b> <b>at</b> one point on the ball. The theorem was first stated by Henri Poincaré in the late 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Baby mice, called pinkies or pups, {{are born}} blind, naked, and deaf. Their {{eyes are closed}} and their ears are stuck {{to the sides of}} their heads. Mothers may eat any dead or sickly offspring. Pups begin to grow <b>hair</b> <b>at</b> two to four days. Ears open at three to five days, and the pups will start vocalizing. Eyes open at 14 days, and the babies will start {{exploring}} the world around them. At three weeks old they look like miniature versions of adult mice. At four weeks the males in the litter should be separated out so as to not cause the mother and sisters to become pregnant, while the females can be left in with the mother.|$|E
