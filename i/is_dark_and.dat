5|$|The chapel {{beneath its}} large onion dome <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> {{cavernous}} {{and decorated with}} carved giltwood, the detailing highlighted in red, green, blue and pink, by the Portuguese sculptor Silvestre Faria Lobo. The upper level has galleries {{for the use of}} royal personages who would sit apart from the congregation. One of these galleries contains a small Rococo pipe organ. A feature of the chapel is the ornate portable font, its marble basin resting in an elaborate Rococo frame surmounted by a carved wood cover.|$|E
5|$|Early {{pressings}} of {{the sleeve}} {{were presented in}} a six-panel gatefold cover, with one side displaying the landscape in the daytime, whilst the other shows the same image at night, playing {{with the idea that}} during the day, the countryside is glorious and the city is dull and grey, whereas at nighttime the countryside <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> the city is illuminated and alive. To prioritize the design, no text was included on the sleeve apart from a promotional sticker shaped like a red balloon featuring the band's name and album title. Later copies of the album came in a standard plastic case with a protective cardboard sleeve.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that Oberon formed from the {{accretion}} disk that surrounded Uranus just after the planet's formation. The moon consists of approximately equal amounts of ice and rock, and is probably differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water may be present at {{the boundary between the}} mantle and the core. The surface of Oberon, which <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> slightly red in color, appears to have been primarily shaped by asteroid and comet impacts. It is covered by numerous impact craters reaching 210km in diameter. Oberon possesses a system of chasmata (graben or scarps) formed during crustal extension {{as a result of the}} expansion of its interior during its early evolution.|$|E
5|$|Plotinus {{argued that}} since the fixed stars are much more distant than the planets, it is laughable to imagine the planets' effect on mankind should depend on their {{position}} {{with respect to the}} zodiac. He also argues that the interpretation of the moon's conjunction with a planet as good when the moon is full, but bad when the moon is waning, is clearly wrong, as from the moon's point of view, half of her surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet's point of view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light from the moon, but when the moon is full to us, it <b>is</b> <b>dark,</b> <b>and</b> therefore bad, on the side facing the planet.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} Thebe <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> {{appears to be}} reddish in color. There is a {{substantial}} asymmetry between leading and trailing hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3times brighter than the trailing one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere, which excavate a bright material (probably ice) from {{the interior of the}} moon. The surface of Thebe is heavily cratered and it appears that {{there are at least three}} or four impact craters that are very large, each being roughly comparable in size to Thebe itself.|$|E

5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{the wood of}} different trees, the effects of climate on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The wood of palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E
5|$|Triaenops menamena is a {{medium-sized}} species with variable fur coloration, ranging from reddish brown to gray. It is larger and darker than Paratriaenops auritus and P.furculus. Among living Triaenops species, it {{is smaller than}} T.persicus and T.afer, but somewhat larger than T.parvus. The extinct Triaenops goodmani, which is known only from three mandibles (lower jaws), is also larger. In the complexly shaped noseleaf (a group of fleshy structures around the nose and mouth), T.menamena has the trident structure characteristic of Triaenops and Paratriaenops: three adjacent lancets (projecting structures) on the posterior leaf. In T.menamena, the two outer lancets are shorter than the middle one and curved, whereas the three lancets are more equal in Paratriaenops. The anterior leaf contains a broad, flat, horizontal process and the intermediate leaf contains a pointed process. The ears are small and broad and contain notches on the inner side. The fur is silky and the hairs on the body are about 5 to 6mm long. The wing membrane <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> translucent {{and the end of}} the tail usually projects from the uropatagium (tail membrane). Males average slightly larger than females. Wingspan is 270 to 305mm (10.6 to 12.0in).|$|E

The passage of the corridor <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> the walls on either side are covered with two layers of paintings from floor to ceiling.|$|E
25|$|Embryological {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} the zebra's background colour <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> the white is an addition. The first subspecies to be described, the now-extinct quagga, had plain brown hindquarters. There have been various mutations of the zebra's pelage, from mostly white to mostly black. Rare albino zebras have been recorded in the forests of Mount Kenya.|$|E
25|$|In {{areas such}} as Newfoundland, the birds, along with the related thick-billed murre, are {{referred}} to as 'turrs' or 'tuirs', and are consumed. The meat <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> quite oily, due to the birds' diet of fish. Eggs have also been harvested. Eggers from San Francisco took almost half a million eggs a year from the Farallon Islands in the mid-19th century to feed the growing city.|$|E

25|$|When alpha {{hemolysis}} (α-hemolysis) is present, the agar {{under the}} colony <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> greenish. Streptococcus pneumoniae {{and a group}} of oral streptococci (Streptococcus viridans or viridans streptococci) display alpha hemolysis. This is sometimes called green hemolysis because of the color change in the agar. Other synonymous terms are incomplete hemolysis and partial hemolysis. Alpha hemolysis is caused by hydrogen peroxide produced by the bacterium, oxidizing hemoglobin to green biliverdin.|$|E

Jorgensen titled his photograph Kissing the War Goodbye. It shows less of Times Square in the background, lacking the characteristic {{view of the}} complex intersection so that the location needs to be identified, it <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> shows few details of the main subjects, and it does not show the lower legs and feet of the subjects.|$|E
25|$|In the Jagannath tradition, one {{particularly}} popular in {{eastern and central}} regions of India, he is more often called Balabhadra. Balarama is one in the triad, wherein Balarama is shown together with his brother Jagannath (Krishna) and sister Shubhadra (Lakshmi). Jagannath is identifiable from his circular eyes compared to oval of Shubhadra and almond shaped eyes of the abstract icon for Balarama. Further, Balarama's face is white, Jagannath's icon <b>is</b> <b>dark,</b> <b>and</b> Subhadra icon is yellow. The third difference is the flat head of Jagannath icon, compared to semi-circular carved head of abstract Balarama. The shape of Balabhadra's head, also called Balarama or Baladeva in these regions, varies in some temples between somewhat flat and semi-circular.|$|E

25|$|This rune {{stone in}} style Pr3 {{and it is}} one of the runestones in Hagby. was {{discovered}} together with U 151 in a collapsed basement under the eastern part of the foundation of the main building of the farm Lissby. When it was discovered, it was still standing but it had been crushed and it crumbled into 50 pieces when it was removed from the wall. It was reassembled but the upper part had been lost and could not be retrieved. In 1931, it was raised in the garden of Hagby. The stone <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> it is 1.23 m tall and 0.3 m wide. The inscription is damaged in several places.|$|E
25|$|Cutaneous anthrax {{infection}} in humans shows up as a boil-like skin lesion that eventually forms an ulcer {{with a black}} center (eschar), often beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> usually concentrated as a black dot. Cutaneous infections generally form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure. Without treatment about 20% of cutaneous skin infection cases progress to toxemia and death. Respiratory {{infection in}} humans initially presents with cold or flu-like symptoms for several days, followed by severe (and often fatal) respiratory collapse. Historical mortality was 92%. Gastrointestinal infection in humans is most often caused by eating anthrax-infected meat and is characterized by serious gastrointestinal difficulty, vomiting of blood, severe diarrhea, acute inflammation of the intestinal tract, and loss of appetite. After the bacteria invades the bowel system, it spreads through the bloodstream throughout the body, making more toxins on the way.|$|E
25|$|Members of {{the species}} have been {{observed}} to use their bodies to fill potholes in the pathway between the nest and prey. By filling these obstacles, the ants greatly increase the overall prey-laden traffic back to the nest. Each ant will walk to a hole and measure itself {{to see if it}} fits; if it does, it will lie across the hole motionless to allow other members of the colony to cross at a higher speed. If it does not fit, it will continue past the hole and allow another ant to check. Ants will also cooperate, with multiple ants forming a plug, if one ant is too small for the hole. Once in place in a hole, the ant(s) can stay there for many hours or until it <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> the traffic flow has diminished greatly, at which point they will return to the nest. This behavior most likely formed among members of the Eciton burchelli species because of its evolutionary advantage. An increase in trail speed and efficiency leads to a larger daily prey intake by the colony. This raises the colony's collective fitness, allowing for faster reproduction.|$|E
