If the layered RUB- 39 is first silylated with dichlorodimethylsilane (DCDMS) or hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS), an interlayer expanded structure is created after calcination. The DCDMS <b>expanded</b> <b>material</b> contains 10 - and 12 -ring pores instead of 8 - and 10 -ring pores.

50|$|Silicon is an earth {{abundant}} element, and is fairly inexpensive to refine to high purity. When alloyed with lithium {{it has a}} theoretical capacity of ~3,600 milliampere hours per gram (mAh/g), which is nearly 10 times the energy density of graphite electrodes (372 mAh/g). One of silicon's inherent traits, unlike carbon, is {{the expansion of the}} lattice structure by as much as 400% upon full lithiation (charging). For bulk electrodes, this causes great structural stress gradients within the <b>expanding</b> <b>material,</b> inevitably leading to fractures and mechanical failure, which significantly limits the lifetime of the silicon anodes. In 2011, a group of researchers assembled data tables that summarized the morphology, composition, and method of preparation of those nanoscale and nanostructured silicon anodes, along with their electrochemical performance.Below are various structural morphologies attempted to overcome issue with silicon's intrinsic properties.|$|E
5000|$|The {{generation}} lasers {{are short}} pulse (from tens of nanoseconds to femtoseconds) and high peakpower lasers. Common lasers used for ultrasound generation are solid state Q-Switched Nd:YAG and gas lasers (CO2 or Excimers) [...] The physical principle is of thermal expansion (also called thermoelastic regime) or ablation. In the thermoelastic regime, the ultrasound {{is generated by}} the sudden thermal expansion due to the heating of a tiny surface of the material by the laser pulse. If the laser power is sufficient to heat the surface above the material boiling point, some material is evaporated (typically some nanometres) andultrasound is generated by the recoil effect of the <b>expanding</b> <b>material</b> evaporated. In the ablation regime, a plasma is often formed above the material surface and its expansion can make a substantial contributionto the ultrasonic generation. consequently the emissivity patterns and modal content are different for the two different mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Stars vibrate {{according}} to many different pulsation modes {{in much the same}} way that musical instruments emit a variety of sounds. Listening to an air on the guitar does not leave any doubt as to the nature of the instrument, and an experienced musician can even deduce the cords' material and tension. Similarly, stellar pulsation modes are characteristic of global stellar properties and of the internal physical conditions. Analyzing these modes is thus a way of probing stellar interiors to infer stellar chemical composition, rotation profiles and internal physical properties such as temperatures and densities. Asteroseismology is the science which studies the vibration modes of a star. Each of these modes can be mathematically represented by a spherical harmonic of degree l and azimuthal order m. Some examples are presented here below with a color scheme in which blue (red) indicates contracting (<b>expanding)</b> <b>material</b> (Sébastien Salmon). The pulsation amplitudes are highly exaggerated.|$|E

40|$|Recent all-sky {{surveys have}} led to the {{discovery}} of new types of transients. These include stars disrupted by the central supermassive black hole, and supernovae that are 10 – 100 times more energetic than typical ones. However, the nature of even more energetic transients that apparently occur in the innermost regions of their host galaxies is hotly debated 1, 2, 3. Here we report the discovery of the most energetic of these to date: PS 1 - 10 adi, with a total radiated energy of ~ 2. 3 [*]×[*] 1052 [*]erg. The slow evolution of its light curve and persistently narrow spectral lines over ∼[*] 3 [*]yr are inconsistent with known types of recurring black hole variability. The observed properties imply powering by shock interaction between <b>expanding</b> <b>material</b> and large quantities of surrounding dense matter. Plausible sources of this <b>expanding</b> <b>material</b> are a star that has been tidally disrupted by the central black hole, or a supernova. Both could satisfy the energy budget. For the former, we would be forced to invoke a new and hitherto unseen variant of a tidally disrupted star, while a supernova origin relies principally on environmental effects resulting from its nuclear location. Remarkably, we also discover that PS 1 - 10 adi is not an isolated case. We therefore surmise that this new population of transients has previously been overlooked due to incorrect association with underlying central black hole activity...|$|E

40|$|Features of {{isentropic}} {{expansion of}} warm dense matter (WDM) created by intense energy fluxes (strong shock compression or instant isochoric heating by laser or heavy ions) are under discussion in situation when ($i$) [...] thermodynamic trajectory of such expansion crosses binodal of liquid-gas phase transition, and ($ii$) [...] expansion within the two-phase region is going along equilibrium branch (not metastable one) of the two-phase mixture isentrope. It {{is known in}} the plane case that because of break in the expansion isentrope at binodal point (in $P-V$ plane) i. e. jump of sound velocity in this point, there appears extended zone ("boiling layer") of uniformity in <b>expanding</b> <b>material</b> with constant thermodynamic and kinematic parameters. It corresponds just to the state on this binodal of boiling liquid. The point {{is that because of}} self-similarity of such expansion (in plane case) this boiling layer contains finite and fixed part of whole <b>expanding</b> <b>material.</b> This property makes it possible (at least formally) to discuss this type of isentropic expansion of WDM as a tool for generation (and diagnostics) of extended uniform state of matter exactly on binodal (and even in critical point) when parameters of this binodal (and/or thermophysical properties on it) are not known. It is natural to use the term "phase freezeout" for this regime of expansion. It is similar to the terms "chemical freezeout" and "kinetic freezeout", which are widely used in interpretation of quark-hardon transformations during expansion of quark-gluon "fireball" in ultra-high energy ionic collisions in supercolliders. General hydrodynamic scheme of adiabatic movements for the case of ensemble of well positioned plates or foils (stack target) under instant isochoric heating (for example, by heavy ion beam) is considered as elaboration of simple idea of phase freeze-out ("reverberation" regime).
