5000|$|An <b>environmental</b> <b>enterprise</b> is an {{environmentally}} friendly/compatible business. Specifically, an <b>environmental</b> <b>enterprise</b> {{is a business}} that produces value {{in the same manner}} which an ecosystem does, neither producing waste nor consuming unsustainable resources. In addition, an <b>environmental</b> <b>enterprise</b> rather finds alternative ways to produce one’s products instead of taking advantage of animals for the sake of human profits. To be closer to the goal of being {{an environmentally}} friendly company, some environmental enterprises invest their money to develop or improve their technologies which are also environmentally friendly. In addition, environmental enterprises usually try to reduce global warming, so some companies use materials that are environmentally friendly to build their stores. They also set in place regulations that are environmentally friendly. All these efforts of the environmental enterprises can bring positive effects both for nature and people. The concept is rooted in the well-enumerated theories of natural capital, the eco-economy and Cradle to Cradle Design. Examples of <b>environmental</b> <b>enterprise</b> would be Seventh Generation, Inc., and Whole Foods.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. In 2001 Kofi Annan stated that 'trade not aid' is the long-term route {{out of poverty}} for Africa. This research project identifies examples of social and <b>environmental</b> <b>enterprises</b> in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East African Community (EAC), to explore and evaluate the role that these enterprises may play as a mechanism to 'trickle up' social, environmental and economic benefits from within local communities. A directory will be developed of examples of social or <b>environmental</b> <b>enterprises</b> that produce, retail, manufacture or offer services within the SADC and EAC countries, {{as well as the}} donor agencies, voluntary associations and assurance schemes that support these. Using a mixed methodology combining archival data analysis, surveys, and interviews the study will analyse the examples with the Directory, followed by in-depth qualitative case study research on 9 - 12 social and/or <b>environmental</b> <b>enterprises</b> from within Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, and Zambia. This study will consider the interaction of these enterprises with their local and global supply chains, explore the role of donor funding and industry associations, and evaluate the specific role that such enterprises may play in poverty alleviation and sustainable development within communities typically considered to be in the economic 'base of the pyramid'...|$|R

40|$|Promoting {{social and}} {{environmental}} entrepreneurship is suggested by many, including international institutions, national development agencies and non-governmental organizations, as critical in tackling longstanding complex global sustainable development problems. However while interest {{in this kind of}} alternative entrepreneurship grows, with a proliferation of claims made about its potential to catalyze societal transformation, research in this field remains nascent and fragmented, particularly in relation to Africa. There are few examples of work systematically examining the impacts of social and <b>environmental</b> <b>enterprises</b> on sustainable development and poverty alleviation, especially research based on rigorous empirical fieldwork. This paper begins addressing these limitations by proposing a framework for mapping the sustainable development and poverty alleviation impacts of social and <b>environmental</b> <b>enterprises</b> in Africa.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Environmental</b> <b>enterprise</b> systems (EES) are {{integrated}} software services {{that offer a}} platform to automate and manage environmental sustainability processes, data, risk and reporting. EES are widely used in organisations, but their benefits depend on nurturing value creating mechanisms and pathways. Since the organisational value of EES has not been well researched and documented in the information systems literature, we have undertaken an exploratory practitioner literature analysis. The findings indicate that EES investment spurs the development of EES competence and EES-enabled capability which lead to environmental efficiency and competitive values. Based on these findings and drawing from the dynamic capability theory, we contribute an EES value framework. This paper also illustrates to business organisations how to leverage EES’s potential to improve environmental sustainability without trading off economic outcome...|$|E

40|$|Objectives The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose a framework for mapping the sustainable development and poverty alleviation impacts of social and environmental enterprises in Africa. This framework is then piloted with reference to an East African Ecobusiness. • Prior Work This paper is based on data collected as part of a wider research project examining social and environmental enterprises across the 19 countries of Southern and Eastern Africa. In total, the sustainable development and poverty alleviation impacts of 20 in-depth case studies in 4 countries are being examined. • Approach Data was collected using in-depth interviews with multiple stakeholders associated with the case study business. Secondary materials were also analysed and a quantitative survey of customers undertaken. • Results In addition to their impacts on the environment, African eco businesses can also have substantial social, economic and wider poverty alleviation impacts. This paper maps the impacts of a case study East African ecobusiness, as part of developing a social and <b>environmental</b> <b>enterprise</b> impact framework for Africa and the wider developing world. In our case study, positive and negative impacts are identified, while questions are raised in relation to tradeoffs between social and environmental objectives and temporal dimensions of impact. The usefulness of existing frameworks for understanding the social, environmental and development impacts of these kinds of organisations are also considered. • Implications This paper outlines the necessity of building an African-centric impact map to capture the multi-level poverty alleviation and sustainable development impacts of social and <b>environmental</b> <b>enterprise</b> activity in developing world environments. The framework proposed also offers guidance to businesses operating in Africa about the factors that might be considered as part of their wider social and environmental responsibilities. • Value Assessing the impact of social and environmental enterprises, especially as a route to development within low income countries, is receiving increasing attention in academia and beyond. This paper presents a useful contribution to the scarce literature on social and environmental enterprises in Africa...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the implementation of}} a new and rapidly emerging class of enterprise software system for managing environmental resources such as energy and carbon emissions. Analysis of {{the implementation of a}}n <b>environmental</b> <b>enterprise</b> resource planning (ERP) system at a leading global software and technology services company, SunGard Data Systems Inc., yielded three primary findings. First, we found that adoption of environmental ERP supported implementation of the corporate environmental sustainability strategy, and at the same time, may transform that very strategy. Second, we uncovered unique data sharing hurdles originating in the upstream energy information value chain. Finally, we identified the role of private equity as one important stakeholder that influences environmental ERP adoption. Overall, our analysis revealed that well-established IS phenomena have unique underlying mechanisms in the environmental sustainability context, inform understanding of cause and effect, and may ultimately enhance managerial practice and inform theoretical understanding...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Developing {{countries}} did {{not start}} off as demandeurs of global environmental governance. Although they are still rather skeptical about the global <b>environmental</b> <b>enterprise,</b> they {{have come a long}} way from being the vigorous contestants that they were three decades ago. This fascinating evolution has not only changed the views of developing countries but has also transformed the shape of the global environmental discourse, most significantly by turning what used to be global environmental politics into what is now the global politics of sustainable development. This paper charts this evolution by using the twin conceptual lenses of effectiveness and legitimacy and the heuristic markers of the three key global conferences on the global environment (Stockholm 1972; Rio de Janeiro 1992; Johannesburg 2002). The paper argues that the pre-Stockholm era was exemplified by a politics of contestation by the South; the Stockholm-to-Rio period was a period of reluctant participation as a new global compact emerged around the notion of sustainable development; and the post-Rio years have seen the emergence of more meaningful, but still hesitant, engagement by the developing countries in the global environmental project but very much around the promise and potential of actualizing sustainable development...|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a summary of}} the Information Technology and Environmental Decision Making Workshop that was held at Harvard University, October 1 - 3, 1998. Over sixty participants from across the US took part in discussions that focused on the current practice of using information technology to support environmental decision making and on future considerations of information technology development, information policies, and data quality issues in this area. Current practice is focusing on geographic information systems and visualization tools, Internet applications, and data warehousing. In addition, numerous organizations are developing <b>environmental</b> <b>enterprise</b> systems to integrate environmental information resources. Plaguing these efforts are issues of data quality (and public trust), system design, and organizational change. In the future, much effort needs to focus on building community-based environmental decision-making systems and processes, which will be a challenge given that exactly what needs to be developed is largely unknown and that environmental decision making in this arena has been characterized by a high level of conflict. Experimentation and evaluation are needed to contribute to efficient and effective learning about how best to use information technology to improve environmental decision making...|$|E
40|$|The California <b>Environmental</b> <b>Enterprise</b> (CEE) {{is a joint}} {{program of}} the Department of Energy (DOE), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories. Its {{goal is to make}} DOE {{laboratory}} expertise accessible to hazardous site cleanups in the state This support might involve working directly with parties responsible for individual cleanups or it might involve working with the California Environmental Protection Agency to develop tools that would be applicable across a broad range of sites. As part of its initial year`s activities, the CEE supported a review to examine where laboratory risk and risk-based systems analysis capabilities might be most effectively applied. To this end, this study draws the following observations. The labs have a clear role in analyses supporting the demonstration and transfer of laboratory characterization or remediation technologies. The labs may have opportunities in developing broadly applicable analysis tools and computer codes for problems such as site characterization or efficient management of resources. Analysis at individual sites, separate from supporting lab technologies or prototyping general tools, may be appropriate only in limited circumstances. In any of these roles, the labs` capabilities extend beyond health risk assessment to the broader areas of risk management and risk-based systems analysis...|$|E

The E 2 SP {{online reporting}} platform {{presented in this paper}} is partly funded by the European Commission in the eTEN program. The DPSIR model (Driving force – Pressure – State – Impact – Response), adopted Europe-wide as the reference model to manage and analyze the environmental issues, represents also the theoretical basis of the E 2 SP (Environ-mental Enterprise Service Provider) project funded by the European Commission in the e-TEN program. According to the DPSIR model and the legislative framework, all the environmental agencies in the Member States are in charge of measuring the State of the environment and evaluate the Impact; this implies a data analysis and reporting activity, which constitutes one of the core responsibilities of the agencies. The E 2 SP project offers a highly original approach to these activities trough the use of cutting edge information technologies, as {{it is based on the}} first environmental information system which combines the advantages of first-rate consolidated technology (such as Business Intelligence applied to a Data Warehouse type model) and innovative ar-chitecture tailored to environmental data management...|$|E
