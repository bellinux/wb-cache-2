40|$|Introduction: <b>Hot</b> <b>flush</b> is {{the most}} common problem in menopausal women. One of the {{alternative}} treatments is phytostrogens. So this study aimed {{to examine the effects of}} fenugreek and flaxseeds on frequency and severity of <b>hot</b> <b>flush.</b> Methods: In this randomized controlled clinical trials the sample population was 60 women with <b>hot</b> <b>flush</b> who referred to urbon heath centers. They divided into two groups. For the first group 6 g fenugreek and for the other group 25 g flaxseeds were prescribed for four continuous weeks. The inclusion criteria were on menses in lately 12 months, normal blood pressure, no use of antidepressants and estrogen and progesterone hormones in lately 6 weeks, no anticoagulant, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like brufen, no asthma and allergy. The exclusion criteria were no correct use of herbals, allergy to drugs, and change the life place. The severity and frequency of <b>hot</b> <b>flush</b> were examined in fourth and eighth weeks. Results: The severity of <b>hot</b> <b>flush</b> in flax group was (1. 163, 1. 614) 1. 389 and in fenugreek group it was (1. 541, 1. 992) 1. 767 in eighth week. Frequency mean of <b>hot</b> <b>flush</b> in fenugreek was (0. 926, 1. 373) 1. 149 and for flaxseeds it was (1. 102, 1. 542) 1. 322 in eighth week. Conclusions: Fenugreek and flaxseeds decreased the severity and frequency of <b>hot</b> <b>flush.</b> But for herbal supplements it needs the additional investigations and samples in the other regions. ...|$|R

2500|$|Oophorectomy is {{associated}} with an increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures. [...] A potential risk for oophorectomy performed after menopause is not fully elucidated. [...] Reduced levels of testosterone in women is predictive of height loss, which may occur as a result of reduced bone density. [...] In women under the age of 50 who have undergone oophorectomy, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is often used to offset the negative effects of sudden hormonal loss such as early-onset osteoporosis as well as menopausal problems like <b>hot</b> <b>flushes</b> that are usually more severe than those experienced by women undergoing natural menopause.|$|E
50|$|In {{his early}} research, Judd and his {{collaborators}} showed that the ovaries of postmenopausal women could secrete amounts of androgen, which can act as precursors to estrogen. He then began investigating the physiology of <b>hot</b> <b>flushes,</b> a characteristic symptom of menopause. He developed techniques to monitor the onset and severity of <b>hot</b> <b>flushes,</b> using electrodes to measure rises in skin temperature due to vasodilation, and pulse rate. These objective measurements of <b>hot</b> <b>flushes</b> later assisted in assessing the effectiveness of treatments mitigating the {{signs and symptoms of}} menopause, including hormone replacement therapy. He led the first trials demonstrating the efficacy and safety of the transdermal estrogen patch known as Estraderm.|$|E

40|$|Objective: <b>Hot</b> <b>flush</b> is {{the most}} common and severe problem of menopausal period. Estrogen is used for {{elimination}} of <b>hot</b> <b>flush</b> as an original and selective medicine. The objective was to determine the lowest useful dose because of estrogen’s side effects. Methodology: This clinical trial was done on 180 menopausal women who were complaining of <b>hot</b> <b>flush.</b> They were randomly divided in three groups. Group one took 0. 3 mg conjugated estrogen plus 1. 25 mg medroxyprogestronacetate, group two took 0. 15 mg conjugated estrogen plus 1. 25 mg medroxyprogestronacetate and group three took placebo for one month. <b>Hot</b> <b>flush</b> improvements in these three groups were defined. Results: The average improvement was 78. 5 % with median 80 and mode 80 in group one (0. 3 mg). The average improvement was 63. 3 percent with median 60 and mode 60 in group two (0. 15 mg). The average improvement was 13. 8 % with median one and mode one in group three (placebo). Conclusion: Due to average improvement of 63. 3 % in 0. 15 mg conjugated esrogen user group it is logical to begin <b>hot</b> <b>flush</b> treatment with this 0. 15 mg conjugated estrogen dose...|$|R

40|$|Many {{breast cancer}} {{patients}} suffer from <b>hot</b> <b>flush</b> and medical menopause as side effects of treatment. Some patients undergo acupuncture, rather than hormone therapy, to relieve these symptoms, but the efficacy of acupuncture is uncertain. This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of acupuncture on <b>hot</b> <b>flush</b> and menopause symptoms in women with breast cancer. A literature search was performed, following the PRISMA Statement and without language restrictions, of 7 databases from inception through March 2017. All selected studies were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that examined the effect of needle acupuncture on <b>hot</b> <b>flush</b> and menopause symptoms in patients with breast cancer. The methodological quality of these trials was assessed using Cochrane criteria, and meta-analysis software (RevMan 5. 2) was {{used to analyze the}} data. We examined 844 {{breast cancer patients}} (average age: 58 years-old) from 13 RCTs. The trials had medium-to-high quality, based on the modified Jadad scale. The meta-analysis showed that acupuncture had no significant effect on the frequency and the severity of <b>hot</b> <b>flush</b> (p = 0. 34; p = 0. 33), but significantly ameliorated menopause symptoms (p = 0. 009). None of the studies reported severe adverse events. Acupuncture significantly alleviated menopause symptoms, but had no effect on <b>hot</b> <b>flush.</b> Breast cancer patients concerned about the adverse effects of hormone therapy should consider acupuncture. Further large-scale studies that also measure biomarkers or cytokines may help to elucidate the mechanism by which acupuncture alleviates menopause symptoms in patients with breast cancer...|$|R
