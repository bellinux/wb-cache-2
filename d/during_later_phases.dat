25|$|The {{development}} of Lost Odyssey was first proposed to Microsoft Game Studios by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. The first discussions began in 2003. It was {{a collaboration between}} Mistwalker, an independent game studio set up by Sakaguchi in 2004, and Microsoft. It was initially an internal project by Microsoft with Sakaguchi, but development ran into difficulties. Faced with critical problems, Microsoft decided to found a dedicated studio to help with development: this became Feelplus, which formed one part of AQ Interactive. The staff of feelplus included {{a large number of}} developers from the defunct Nautilus, which had helped develop The Legend of Dragoon, Phantom Dust and the Shadow Hearts series. Among the shared staff were art director Takamasa Ohsawa. They also included developers from Microsoft and Sega. Further freelance staff were also brought in. Development started in 2004 and lasted three and a half years. Mistwalker handled the story and character design, Feelplus developed the actual product, while Microsoft provided funding, project management and testing. While development started with ten people, at development's peak it was at 150. The game's respective director and technical director, Daisuke Fukugawa and Katsuhisa Higuchi, had previously worked at Square Enix. Sakaguchi was fairly closely involved during the initial development, but <b>during</b> <b>later</b> <b>phases</b> he took a more hands-off supervisory approach.|$|E

50|$|At {{the moment}} of the explosion, the {{fireball}} is formed. The ascending, roughly spherical mass of hot, incandescent gases changes shape due to atmospheric friction and cools its surface by energy radiation, turning from a sphere to a violently rotating spheroidal vortex. A Rayleigh-Taylor instability is formed as the underneath cool air initially pushes the bottom fireball gases into an inverted cup shape. This causes turbulence and a vortex that sucks more air into its center, creating external afterwinds and cooling itself. The speed of its rotating slows down as it cools, and may stop entirely <b>during</b> <b>later</b> <b>phases.</b> The vaporized parts of the weapon and ionized air cool into visible gases, forming the early cloud; the white-hot vortex core becomes yellow, then dark red, then loses visible incandescence. With further cooling, the bulk of the cloud fills in as atmospheric moisture condenses. As the cloud ascends and cools, its buoyancy lessens, and its ascent slows.|$|E
50|$|The Calden earthwork, a large {{enclosure}} northwest of modern Kassel, was built around 3700 BC. It is an irregular enclosure of two ditches and a palisade, encompassing {{an area of}} 14 hectares. The enclosure has five openings, perhaps comparable to British Causewayed enclosures. Although it can with some certainty be seen as derived from the Michelsberg tradition, material associated with its early phases suggests a close connectionn with early Wartberg. It {{appears to have been}} a tradition for several centuries to bury animal bones (food refuse?) and broken pots in pits dug into the partially filled-in earthwork ditches. The ditches also contain the remains of many human inhumations. This activity continued until circa 2000 BC and was particularly intensive during the Wartberg period. Two nearby graves postdate the earthwork by several centuries, but coincide with that activity. While the original function of the earthwork is not necessarily explained by these finds, it appears likely that at least <b>during</b> <b>later</b> <b>phases</b> of its use it had a ritual significance, perhaps connected with a cult of the dead.In contrast, the enclosure around the settlement at Wittelsberg appears to be simply protective/defensive in nature.|$|E

40|$|Often {{we find it}} {{difficult}} to incorporate any changes in a software project <b>during</b> <b>later</b> <b>phases</b> of its development, or during post-delivery maintenance. Primary reason for this is inflexibility in design and code which makes {{it difficult}} for changes to be incorporated. This inflexibility substantially increases the cost of making changes and this metaphor has been termed as Technical Debt [1]. While Technical Debt cannot be eliminated completely, its burden needs to be reduced. Many practitioners, especially from agile community, have suggested some practices to avoid or eliminate Technical Debt. This paper discusses on a systematic method to evaluate the six software engineering practices that a developer can follow to minimize Technical Debt. These practices have been used and found to be effective when implemented in projects as discussed here...|$|E

40|$|A Japanese common squid, Todarodes pacificus with {{an unusually}} short left fourth arm was {{captured}} from the Sea of Japan on October 1996. This specimen was a mature male (mantle length 216 mm, body weight 186 g) "Kawa-ika" squid {{that seemed to}} be nearing the end of its reproductive life. About two-thirds of the left fourth arm of this individual was lost and the surface of the arm's tip was completely covered with skin. This short arm was either caused by i) malformation or ii) accidental loss of the tip, followed by regeneration. Arm regeneration is common in cephalopods, and the left fourth arm of the present specimen was very similar to the regenerating arms of other cephalopods. Therefore, the arm of the present specimen may be regenerating. Since T. pacificus is a terminal spawner, this specimen indicates that regeneration can still occur even <b>during</b> <b>later</b> <b>phases</b> of the life cycle...|$|E

In addition, existing research on the first phase of recruitment is limited because most recruitment research has only concentrated on a small range of recruitment practices that are typically deployed <b>during</b> <b>later</b> <b>phases</b> of recruitment like the job interview (Rynes, 1991).

40|$|In this study, we {{document}} that Toxoplasma gondii differentiation and reactivation are mediated by systemic CD 8 T-cell dysfunction during chronic infection. We demonstrate that CD 8 + T-cell exhaustion occurs despite control of parasitemia during early-chronic toxoplasmosis. <b>During</b> <b>later</b> <b>phases,</b> these cells become exhausted, leading to parasite reactivation and mortality. Concomitant with increased CD 8 + T-cell apoptosis and decreased effector response, this dysfunction {{is characterized by}} a graded elevation in expression of inhibitory receptor PD- 1 on these cells in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissue. Blockade of the PD- 1 –PDL- 1 pathway reinvigorates this suboptimal CD 8 + T-cell response, resulting in control of parasite reactivation and prevention of mortality in chronically infected animals. To the best of our knowledge, this report is unique in showing that exposure to a persistent pathogen despite initial control of parasitemia can lead to CD 8 + T-cell dysfunction and parasite reactivation...|$|E

The proposed approach models simultaneously product and supply chain architectures pointing out the sequencing of tasks and intertwined relations between partners. Through the introduction of compatibility, the goal is to help a company's managers to select their most relevant partners not only based on suppliers' selection criteria but also by using the inter-partners compatibility. To do so, {{it will be necessary to}} develop compatibility measures which should be assessed for each couple of immediate neighbour partners. We suggest a classification of different collaboration situations allowing performance improvement.

40|$|Did {{the late}} {{industrialization}} in Europe’s periphery improve life for its urban class? This paper examines family living conditions in northern Spain during late industrialization in the interwar period. We {{concentrate on the}} Basque region, one of the emerging industrial areas from the 1870 s on. Historiography holds that in the medium-term urban development and industrialization increased real wages and overall standards of living. We contrast this empirically by examining the effects of income shocks on families using high frequency data from 1914 until 1936. These contrasts introduce nutritional adequacy of family diets as an additional way of measuring living conditions. Our results indicate that real income did not improve and that demographic and social deprivation variables were highly responsive to short term economic shocks. This response points to the fragility of urban breadwinner families even <b>during</b> <b>later</b> <b>phases</b> of industrialization; the urban penalty was by far not being compensated by the higher nominal wage...|$|E
40|$|Reward-based decision-{{learning}} {{refers to}} the process of learning to select those actions that lead to rewards while avoiding actions that lead to punishments. This process, known to rely on dopaminergic activity in striatal brain regions, is compromised in Parkinson’s disease (PD). We hypothesized that such decision-learning deficits are alleviated by induced positive affect, which is thought to incur transient boosts in midbrain and striatal dopaminergic activity. Computational measures of probabilistic reward-based decision-learning were determined for 51 patients diagnosed with PD. Previous work has shown these measures to rely on the nucleus caudatus (outcome evaluation during the early phases of learning) and the putamen (reward prediction <b>during</b> <b>later</b> <b>phases</b> of learning). We observed that induced positive affect facilitated learning, through its effects on reward prediction rather than outcome evaluation. Viewing a few minutes of comedy clips served to remedy dopamine-related problems associated with frontostriatal circuitry and, consequently, learning to predict which actions will yield reward...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of presentation}} of influenza virus–derived antigens (Ags), resulting in CD 4 T cell effector and memory generation, remains undefined. Naive influenza-specific CD 4 T cells were transferred into mice {{at various times}} after influenza infection to determine the duration and impact of virus-derived Ag presentation. Ag-specific T cell responses were generated even when the donor T cells were transferred 3 – 4 wk after viral clearance. Transfer of naive CD 4 T cells during early phases of infection resulted in a robust expansion of highly differentiated effectors, which then contracted to {{a small number of}} memory T cells. Importantly, T cell transfer <b>during</b> <b>later</b> <b>phases</b> of infection resulted in a modest expansion of effectors with intermediate phenotypes, which were capable of persisting as memory with high efficiency. Thus, distinct stages of pathogen-derived Ag presentation may provide a mechanism by which T cell heterogeneity is generated and diverse memory subsets are maintained...|$|E
