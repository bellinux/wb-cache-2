40|$|Graduation date: 2010 The {{ability to}} non-destructively assess fish {{condition}} and subsequently track fish behavior and survival can be vital in understanding natural and anthropogenic stressors {{and sources of}} mortality, especially in populations of fish listed as threatened or endangered. I investigated {{the use of a}} quick, non-lethal, external examination technique to assess general health status of run-of-the-river juvenile steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) migrating from the Snake River basin. 	The relationship between external symptoms of captured fish (including body injuries, <b>de-scaling,</b> external symptoms of disease, fin damage, and ectoparasite infestations) and their health status was investigated through pathology analysis of a euthanized subsample of fish. I assessed the relative fitness of steelhead smolts assigned to various categories of health status by measuring the subsequent survival and susceptibility to avian predation of fish that were tagged with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags and released unharmed. Histological analysis was conducted on 222 steelhead sacrificed at the juvenile collection facility of Lower Monumental Dam (LMN) on the lower Snake River during steelhead out-migration in 2008; results indicated that external symptoms of disease, body injuries, <b>de-scaling,</b> and fin damage were all associated with increased prevalence of infectious pathogens. 	Capture-recapture models for 14, 177 steelhead PIT-tagged and released at LMN in 2007 and 2008 indicated that the presence of external symptoms of disease, body injuries, or <b>de-scaling,</b> but not fin damage, were associated with significantly reduced survival probabilities during either short-distance (ca. 119 Rkm) or long-distance (ca. 354 Rkm) migration.

40|$|A {{contributing}} factor {{to the range}} of results of energy-economy models on feasibility and costs for obtaining specified policy goals such as GHG reductions is the mechanism that translates technological progress into cost reductions per technology. In many models this mechanism is represented via a simple learning curve model, where costs decline {{as a function of}} experience, usually represented by cumulative capacity. However, many other factors influence technology-specific cost dynamics, with one major confounding variable being unit level economies of scale- declines in average unit costs arising from the building of larger capacity plants or units. Thus, this paper considers ‘de-scaled’ learning rates {{as an alternative to the}} conventional representation of learning phenomena. <b>De-scaling</b> involves removing unit scale’s influence on cost for a given technology, thereby creating a variable that is the residual of cost’s remaining determining factors, which then is estimated and interpreted as a more appropriate variable to capture learning effects proper. The influence of scale economies and remaining learning effects on technology costs are estimated econometrically with the analysis complemented by simpler analytical methods as well as incorporating results from the engineering literature to represent uncertainties. This paper finds <b>de-scaling</b> substantially reduces the learning rate for a number of energy supply technologies. De-scaled learning rates expressed over cumulative units installed is concluded to be a superior measure of learning effects over traditional formulations of specific costs versus cumulative capacity that confound economies of scale with learning effects, potentially misguiding policies via its resulting overestimation of the potential cost lowering impacts of demand-pull technology deployment incentives...|$|E

The problem of waste disposal is especially severe in plants where the processing is performed by electrically-powered scaling cabinets, but the problem {{does not apply to}} facilities where pellets are burned to produce beat. We examined the beat of combustion and calorific value of the residues from scaling plants {{that can be used in}} the production of refined wood fuels. The residues consist of the empty cones of pine, spruce, larch as well as husks and stems of silver fir. Additionally, we conducted measurements of the beat of combustion for wood and cones of each species and compared them to their respective calorific values. The results revealed that the average calorific value of the cones is in the range 17. 81 – 19. 86 MJ/kg. Our work showed that empty cones have a significantly higher calorific value and beat of combustion than the wood of spruce, larch and fir. In the case of pine, cones and wood did not differ significantly. These results led us to the conclusions that empty <b>de-scaled</b> cones can be utilised as a valuable primary solid fuel or fuel additive for the production of refined products for the local market.

30|$|Metals and alloys react {{electrochemically}} {{with the}} environment to form stable compounds, in which the loss of metals occurs. Metallic structures are exposed to conditions that facilitate corrosion processes. Furthermore, hydrochloric and sulfuric acids are widely used for pickling and <b>de-scaling</b> of carbon steel which promote the acceleration of metallic corrosion, causing ecological risks and economic consequences in term of repair, replacement and product losses [1]. Therefore, the prevention of the corrosion is vital {{not only for the}} protection of metals but also in decreasing the dispersion of the toxic compounds into the environment [2]. One of the best-known methods for corrosion protection is the use of inhibitors [3]. Organic compounds having functional groups such as -OR, -COOH, -SR and/or NR 2 have been reported to inhibit corrosion of metals in acid solutions [4]. The presence of oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen atoms and multiple bonds in organic compounds enhances their adsorption ability and corrosion inhibition efficiency [1]. However, most of these compounds are expensive, toxic and not biodegradable [5]. Therefore, alternative sources of products are preferred. Investigation of plant extracts as corrosion inhibitors is interesting because they are ecologically acceptable and not expensive. Extracts of some plants such as bupleurum lancifolium [6], Limonium thouinii [7], and Punica granatum [8] have been reported to inhibit the corrosion of metals in acid solutions.|$|E

40|$|Some defects on {{the surface}} of carbon steel {{do not need to be}} removed before hot rolling because the surface will be vigorously {{oxidised}} in a reheating environment. Thus the defects can be minimised by oxidising and then removed by the <b>de-scaling</b> process. The defects {{on the surface}} of ferritic stainless steels, however, are not easily removed by oxidation when a high chromium concentration is used. In this paper, a ferritic stainless steel grade 445 was selected as a research material. The effects of different surface features on oxidation and tribological behaviour in the hot rolling process were investigated. Three surface states were prepared, namely, smooth surface, surface with 45 ° grinding marks and surface with oscillation marks. The samples were put into an electric furnace at 1100 °C for reheating. Hot rolling tests were carried out on a 2 -high Hille 100 experimental rolling mill. Rolling forces were measured, and the coefficient of friction was calculated and compared under various rolling parameters. It was found that the original surface profiles with grinding marks were still maintained during oxidation. The original oxide scale on the surface with oscillation marks caused the formation of irregular oxide nodules and the spallation of the oxide scale. Surface morphology and the reduction in thickness had a significant impact on the oxide scale integrity and coefficient of friction in the hot rolling process...|$|E
40|$|In vitro plantlets of Amelanchier alnifolia Nutt. 'Smoky' showed {{inhibited}} {{bud break}} {{in response to}} ABA application to tissue culture growing medium, but did not demonstrate a condition of innate dormancy. Partial formation of terminal buds, and axillary bud transition in phenotype from summer to winter form was produced by inclusion of 50 ÂµM ABA in tissue culture growing medium when BA levels were decreased from 11. 0 ÂµM to 5. 5 ÂµM and NAA was eliminated. Addition of 50 ÂµM ABA to growing medium approximately doubled the - 5 Â°C hardiness levels of control plantlets, but ABA application alone did not generate hardiness levels as high as those seen during low temperature/short day (4 Â°C/ 8 h) acclimation (- 27 Â°C). Addition of BA to medium significantly reduced the efficacy of ABA-induced freezing tolerance. Wounding of plantlets during subculture was found to produce a rapid but transitory increase in hardiness level from - 5 Â°C to - 9 Â°C within 24 hours of subculture. Newlysubcultured plantlets were found to increase in hardiness more rapidly, and {{to a greater extent}} than reports previously published for these plantlets in culture. While short days (8 h) slightly enhanced freezing survival of plantlets under both warm (23 Â°C) and cool (4 Â°C) temperatures, a pre-treatment of short warm days did not increase the rate of plantlet hardening under cold inductive conditions. Buds collected from orchard-grown plants demonstrated rising innate dormancy levels in late summer, with maximum levels between early September and late November.

40|$|An {{oxide scale}} layer always forms at the strip surface during the hot rolling process. As a consequence, <b>de-scaling</b> and {{pickling}} operations must be performed prior or after hot rolling. Many surface defects caused by hot rolling {{are related to}} oxidation in the reheating furnace. One {{of these is the}} melting of eutectic FeO/Fe 2 SiO 4 during reheating over 1170 degrees C giving as a result red scale defects in Si-added steel. On the other hand, steel strip surface oxidation during hot rolling causes an industrial and environmental problem: secondary oxide is removed after roughing, but tertiary oxide scales already start to form before entering the finishing stands. Their properties affect the final steel surface quality and its response to further processing. Furthermore, the addition of alloying elements has an important impact on scale properties. In particular the alloying of silicon effects the region between scale and substrate. It causes peculiar surface properties inherited from its specific oxidation characteristics. Conventional oxidation experiments in air of silicon steels are a valuable too] to study the influence of Si on steel oxidation. After oxidation in air in the temperature range of 900 - 1250 degrees C it has been observed that Si enhance markedly scale adhesion, especially above 1177 degrees C (the eutectic temperature of FeO-Fe 2 SiO 4) and also at lower temperatures.

The main emphasis of this thesis is on the microwear analysis of the worked bones in comparison with experimental and archaeological data. The sample selected displays different kinds of evidences of contact with soft plant on the bone tools, such as Urtica dioica and Salix: therefore it has been organized through a functional classification according to the variability of contact materials and the distribution and polish of the wear. The tool-type identified are Spatula-spacers to weave or make fishing nets; <b>De-scaling</b> tools, to de-scale {{the skin of the}} fish; awls and Projectile-awls, to pierce bark; Ad hoc elongated tools in bird bone, to work Urtica dioica; Harpoons and Decorated objects.

Post-excavation processes have been investigated from a microscopic point of view, allowing the identification of cleaning paper and plastic sieve wear traces that are evident on the bone surface. The state of the bone assemblage opened a window on more theoretical issues; concerning the interpretation of hidden crafts in archaeology.

30|$|In several industries, acid {{solutions}} {{are used for}} the processes like pickling, <b>de-scaling,</b> for removing rust and scale from alloy surface. The aggressive nature of acid causes dissolution of material {{during the course of}} cleaning process which leads to material loss [1, 2, 3]. The most effective approach to minimize this material loss is, use of organic compounds as a corrosion inhibitor in acid solution. A large number of chemical compounds, containing a heteroatom in their ring and presence of an electron-rich center have served for the purpose [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Even though inhibitors are efficient in preventing corrosion, the toxicity of a few organic compounds causes some serious repercussions on the environment. Nowadays, researchers use drug molecules and plant extracts as eco-friendly inhibitor [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. In this concern, 2, 2 ′-disulfanediyldianiline (DSA) compound is synthesized by electrochemical method. In most of chemical synthesis of DSA is done by oxidation of suitable thiols. To serve for this purpose, reagents such as H 2 O 2, MoO 2 Cl 2, metal halides and metals with exchange resin are used [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. The disadvantages of these methods are a very time-consuming process and required maintenance of drastic conditions (either very high temperature or low temperature below zero degrees centigrade). These process also suffered by reduced yield of required products, metal contamination, toxicity, etc. In addition, maintenance of stoichiometric ratio of the reagents is necessary to bring about successful oxidation process. The electrochemical processes generally produces less by-product compared to chemical processes as it is carried out at particular potential value (oxidising/reducing). Electrons are environmentally friendly, in comparison to chemical reagents. Further, the electrochemical processes are characterised by lower temperature, less degradation of product, high energy efficiency, a fewer processing steps, product selectivity through the control of oxidation/reduction potential. That is how we have chosen a green synthesis of 2, 2 ′-disulfanediyldianiline (DSA) via electrochemical methods. There is no reported literature available, on the use of 2, 2 ′-disulfanediyldianiline (DSA) as a corrosion inhibitor for mild steel in HCl media. The scope of this work is to study the effect of DSA compound on corrosion of mild steel in 1  M HCl solution. The quantum chemical calculations are performed to support our experimental findings and to assign suitable mechanism for DSA adsorption.|$|E
30|$|The use of {{corrosion}} inhibitors {{is the most}} practical method to control the metallic dissolution in acidic media and is widely employed in industrial processes like <b>de-scaling,</b> acid pickling, oil well acidizing, etc. Molecules equipped with active corrosion inhibition sites such as hetero atoms like O, S, N, aromatic rings and Schiff bases are found to act as efficient {{corrosion inhibitors}} in aggressive media [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. A few semicarbazones and hydrazones exhibited good corrosion protection ability due {{to the presence of}} C=N group [11, 16]. Electronic effects such as inductive, mesomeric, etc., affect the corrosion inhibition power of molecules. Scientists and industrialists are ever in search of soluble, durable and economic corrosion inhibitors. Many researchers are trying to substantiate the mechanism behind corrosion inhibition of organic molecules on various metals using experimental as well as quantum chemical methods. The corrosion inhibition response of a molecule is closely related to its structure and geometry [8, 9]. The reactions of the inhibitor molecules with aggressive medium may also influence the behavior of the molecules. This type of response of the molecules has {{to be taken into account}} when one explains the mechanism of corrosion inhibition. For instance, the behavior of the Schiff base N,N′-bis(salicylidene)- 1, 2 -ethylenediamine (Salen) and a mixture of its parent molecules, ethylenediamine and salicylaldehyde, as carbon steel corrosion inhibitors in 1  M HCl solution was studied by da Silva et al. [10] using corrosion potential measurements, potentiodynamic polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and spectrophotometric measurements. They reported that results obtained in the presence of Salen were similar to those obtained in the presence of the salicylaldehyde and ethylenediamine mixture, showing that in acid medium the Salen molecule undergoes hydrolysis, regenerating its precursor molecules. In one of previous studies, we could establish the corrosion antagonistic behavior of 3 -acetylphenylhyrazone (3 APPH) on carbon steel in 0.5  M H 2 SO 4. The corrosion rate of CS increased with the concentration of 3 APPH. Intense hydrolysis to this molecule occurred in sulphuric acid, which was confirmed by UV–visible spectroscopy. The same compound showed very high inhibition efficiency (> 99  % at 1.0  mM as per electrochemical studies) on CS surface in 0.5  M H 2 SO 4 in the presence of trace amount of KI [11]. It is quite sure that the corrosion inhibiting capacity of a molecule is a combined effect of its molecular structure, geometry and the way in which it behaves in the aggressive medium in the presence of a metal.|$|E
40|$|V článku uvedeno Hlaváč, Libor M. The {{paper is}} dealing with {{application}} of theoretical equations derived for rock disintegration onto materials with similar behavior—thick scales on hot metal rolling slabs. Penetration of water jet through a hot, rock-like material (e. g. scale) and work of the steam bubbles emerging from the water jet on {{the boundary between the}} scale layer and the hot metal material are described by a set of appropriate equations. The model is applied on the fan jets used for <b>de-scaling</b> process, and it provides both the qualitative and the quantitative results. These results make possible to determine the depth of penetration of water jet into the material of the scales and calculate the sizes of pieces of the disintegrated scales. Both mechanisms of water jet acting on scales, mechanical penetration to a certain depth in the material and the formation of steam bubbles inside the material, create mechanical stresses in the material of scales, especially the tensile and the shear ones. Pieces of scales are separated due to exceeding the limits of the stress and strain in the material of scales. The presented analytical equations describing the process in a simple way yield the quick and apprehensible calculation of applicable results. It is an alternative to solution of a rather complicated set of differential equations describing the mass and heat flow. The proposed theoretical base runs with technical factors and properties that can be obtained from tables or analogies with other materials or processes. The typical water pressure range of rolling mills is 16 – 24 MPa, the equivalent diameter of the applied water nozzle is 2 mm, the average traverse speed of the rolling slab is set to 1 m s− 1, and the mean stand-off distance of the nozzle from the steel slab surface is 150 mm. Calculated depth of penetration into scales is ranging from 5 to 18 mm for these parameters, while the real thickness of scales lies between 1 and 7 mm. Simultaneously, the calculated length of the peeled layer {{in the direction of the}} jet movement ranges from 30 to 70 mm and the cutting width determined from the jet shape and the stand-off distance is 80 – 120 mm. Therefore, the calculated size of the scale debris is 30 [*]×[*] 80 mm for layers thicker than 5 mm and 70 [*]×[*] 120 mm for the ones thinner than 2 mm.

40|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} that a few ppmw sulfur impurity may segregate to the interface of thermally grown alumina scales and the underlying substrate, resulting in bond degradation and premature spallation. This has been shown for NiAl and NiCrAl-based alloys, bare single crystal superalloys, or coated superalloys. The role of reactive elements (especially Y) has been to getter the sulfur in the bulk and preclude interfacial segregation. Pt additions are also very beneficial, however a similar thermodynamic explanation does not apply. The {{purpose of the present}} discussion is to highlight some observations of these effects on Rene' 142, Rene'N 5, PWA 1480, and PWA 1484. For PWA 1480, we have mapped cyclic oxidation and spallation in terms of potential sulfur interfacial layers and found that a cumulative amount of about one monolayer is sufficient to degrade long term adhesion. Depending on substrate thickness, optimum performance occurs if sulfur is reduced below about 0. 2 - 0. 5 ppmw. This is accomplished in the laboratory by hydrogen annealing or commercially by melt-fluxing. Excellent 1150 C cyclic oxidation is thus demonstrated for desulfurized Rene' 142, Rene'N 5, and PWA 1484. Alternatively, a series of N 5 alloys provided by GE-AE have shown that as little as 15 ppmw of Y dopant was effective in providing remarkable scale adhesion. In support of a Y-S gettering mechanism, hydrogen annealing was unable to desulfurize these alloys from their initial level of 5 ppmw S. This impurity and critical doping level corresponds closely to YS or Y 2 S 3 stoichiometry. In many cases, Y-doped alloys or alloys with marginal sulfur levels exhibit an oxidative sensitivity to the ambient humidity called Moisture-Induced Delayed Spallation (MIDS). After substantial scale growth, coupled with damage from repeated cycling, cold samples may spall after a period of time, breathing on them, or immersing them in water. While stress corrosion arguments may apply, we propose that the underlying cause is related to a hydrogen embrittlement reaction: Al alloy + 3 H 2 O = Al(OH) 3 + 3 H(+) + 3 e(-). This mechanism is derived from an analogous moisture-induced hydrogen embrittlement mechanism originally shown for Ni 3 Al and FeAl intermetallics. Consequently, a cathodic hydrogen charging technique was used to demonstrate that electrolytic <b>de-scaling</b> occurs for these otherwise adherent alumina scales formed on Y-doped Rene'N 5, in support of hydrogen effects. Finally, some TBC observations are discussed in light of all of the above. Plasma sprayed 8 YSZ coatings, produced on PWA 1484 without a bond coat, were found to survive more than 1000 1 -hr cycles at 1100 C when desulfurized to below 0. 1 ppmw. At higher sulfur (1. 2 ppmw) levels, moisture sensitivity and delayed TBC failure, referred to as Desk Top Spallation, occurred at just 200 hr. Despite a large degree of scatter, a factor of 5 in life improvement is indicated for desulfurized samples in cyclic furnace tests, confirming the beneficial effect of low sulfur alloys on model TBC systems. (DTS and moisture effects are also observed on commercially applied PVD 7 YSZ coatings on Rene'N 5 +Y with Pt-aluminide bond coats). These types of catastrophic failure were subverted on the model system by segmenting the substrate into a network of 0. 010 high ribs, spaced in. apart, prior to plasma spraying. No failures occurred after 1000 cycles at 1150 C or after 2000 cycles at 1100 C, even after water immersion.

These interventions are carried out in water depths from 200 mto 3, 000 m. This thesis describes SWIS and its applications to subsea well interventions, discusses themain technical issues involved and provides an economic analysis of the cost benefit incomparison to semi-submersible and Drill Ship rig-based systems. Examples of subsea wellinterventions discussed in this thesis include: de-sanding, <b>de-scaling,</b> re-entry drilling andwellhead recovery. A discussion {{and analysis of the}} vessel response to the likely operatingsea states and an analysis of heave compensation for the Coiled Tubing (CT) system isincluded as these are critical factors to the technical viability of SWIS. SWIS is designed to have a light to medium level well intervention capability and it willprovide a tool for common subsea well intervention procedures. It is not designed for tubingchange out which is classified as a heavy level workover. In this case a conventional rig or aHydraulic Workover rig supported by a semi-submersible would be used. SWIS will be designed to include the following capabilities: Well and field abandonment;Artificial Lift Services; Re-entry Drilling using CT including well side tracking anddeepening operations (Operations to include CT under-balanced drilling and ThroughTubing); Deployment and recovery of Sand Control Screens using CT as a conveying tool;Through Tubing Completions using CT as a conveying tool; Post-completion well clean-upoperations; Slick-line and electric line operations and sub-sea wellhead maintenance andrecovery. The SWIS concept vessel is a large scale wave piercing catamaran which will be maintainedon station and heading into the prevailing sea using a Dynamic Positioning System (DPS). Initial modelling of the response of the vessel to typical expected operating sea stateconditions is encouraging because the results indicate that this type of vessel will provide astable platform from which to carry out typical subsea well intervention procedures. The modelling has demonstrated that the vessel motions (other than heave) are minimalunder the expected operating conditions and will be compensated by the Spooled CompositeRiser (SCR) and the CT. The heave amplitude and heave acceleration of the centre of gravity of the vessel will besuch that an off the shelf heave compensation system is available for the Spooled CompositeRiser (SCR). Research has indicated that existing CT heave compensation systems can bereadily modified for use with SWIS to provide the required level of motion compensation tocarry out intervention procedures in moderately rough seas. The hypothesis that a catamaran based platform used for the above purpose has significantpotential economic benefits over a semi-submersible for common types of interventionprocedures is supported by the research completed. It is concluded that the savings resultingfrom the use of the SWIS vessel compared to a semi-submersible would be around USD 360, 000 per day. It is also concluded from the research and modelling completed that SWIS is a technicallyand economically viable system. Based on the survey carried out it has the potential for ahigh degree of utilization in the East Asian and Australian offshore regions due of the abovecost saving.
