5|$|Several teams made {{alterations}} {{to their}} cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Mercedes introduced a new version of their car's rear wing which was designed to work more efficiently with their F-duct system. Ferrari brought a refinement to their exhaust system and modified their diffuser's side channels. Red Bull introduced minor improvements to their car's F-duct system and both of their drivers used a front wing specification which courted controversy at the preceding British Grand Prix. McLaren used a blown <b>diffuser</b> which was discarded after the Friday practice sessions at the previous Grand Prix and was changed for the German Grand Prix. The <b>diffuser</b> been moved outwards but had a longer inner section, the pipe was cut off at an angle, and the carbon materials for its side channel were changed. Sauber came to the circuit with their car carrying several aerodynamic upgrades which included a modified <b>diffuser.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. McLaren, Red Bull, and Williams all revised their front wings. McLaren's revision was designed to separate airflow into two separate channels, with both directing airflow around the outside of the car's front tyres. Red Bull's design, used in the Friday practice sessions, had two vertical slots to the rear of its endplate along with another to avoid creating a vortex when it operated with the planes and endplate. A previous design, debuted at the British Grand Prix, was used both in qualifying and in the race. In addition, the team used a revised <b>diffuser</b> to allow for better management of airflow {{to the top of the}} diffuser's side section. Williams's design debuted for the first time and was designed to make the tyre act like a <b>diffuser</b> which took air in to improve its efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault introduced <b>diffuser</b> designs similar to the Red Bull RB6. Ferrari's design largely changed the shape of their exhaust system, and introduced a new gearbox case for Massa's car to raise the pick-up points of its rear suspension to help him adjust to the changes. They constructed a larger radiator to deal with the additional heat. Mercedes elected not to bring a new gearbox casing, but introduced a new rear <b>diffuser</b> to fully utilise the air blowing from the car's exhaust. Renault's design had the exit of their car's exhaust which had thermal protection against high temperatures and the team introduced a new design of their gearbox casing to allow for the pick-up points for its rear suspension to be accommodated. After running the F-duct device (which increases a car's top speed) in Friday practice, Red Bull decided to use it {{for the remainder of the}} weekend.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} the two {{dimensional}} <b>diffusers</b> with inlet uniform shear flows in the parallel walls were carried out. In general, {{the performance of the}} <b>diffusers</b> with inlet simple shear flows for small divergence angle was lower compared with the <b>diffusers</b> having uniform inlet velocity profiles. However, the pressure-recovery performance of wide-angle <b>diffusers</b> with uniform inlet shear flows was slightly higher than that of the <b>diffusers</b> with uniform inlet velocity profiles. This is characterized by the effects of the variations of spanwise velocity gradients and the secondary flows in the <b>diffusers...</b>|$|R
30|$|Small {{luminous}} <b>diffusers</b> with {{dimensions of}} 4 in × 4 in were {{chosen as the}} providers of illumination. A multitude of these <b>diffusers</b> {{would be used to}} provide three separate layers of lighting – Ambient Lighting Layer, Surround Lighting Layer as well as Task Lighting Layer. The luminous intensity level for each layers of <b>diffusers</b> could be adjusted separately to meet the illumination requirements. The intensity level for all <b>diffusers</b> within each lighting layer were the same. For Ambient Lighting Layer, there was a total of 225 of these <b>diffusers</b> mounted uniformly throughout the ceiling plane. The Surround Lighting Layer comprised of a 2  ft × 2  ft grid of 25 <b>diffusers</b> was located the middle the personal space at 3.5 ft above the desk-top. Similarly, for the Task Lighting Layer, 21 <b>diffusers</b> were mounted at 6 in. above the task surface.|$|R

5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{is based}} on Graham's law, which states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas through a porous barrier is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's molecular mass. In a container with a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is slightly depleted. A container wherein the enrichment process takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a <b>diffuser.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{a widely}} used {{function}} of bioluminescence, providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; millipedes glow for the same purpose. Some marine organisms are believed to emit light for a similar reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish and brittle stars but {{further research is needed}} to fully establish the function of the luminescence. Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they were able to deter predation in this way. The limpet Latia neritoides is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits light. It produces greenish luminescent mucus which may have an anti-predator function. The marine snail Hinea brasiliana uses flashes of light, probably to deter predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient <b>diffuser</b> of light.|$|E
5|$|After the British Grand Prix on 15 July, eight teams {{conducted}} mid-season {{testing at}} the Autodromo Nazionale Monza between 17–20 July {{to prepare for}} the upcoming German Grand Prix at the Hockenheimring. Ricardo Zonta set the fastest times on the first day, ahead of McLaren test driver Alexander Wurz. Michael Schumacher lost control of the rear-end of his car at the Seconda Variante chicane, causing him to slide along the barriers and his car rested in the tyre barriers. Testing was suspended for one hour for the barriers to be repaired. Ferrari later found the crash occurred by a broken <b>diffuser</b> from riding on the kerbs which created a loss of downforce under braking. Michael Schumacher took a medical check and was declared fit to race. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the second day where it was held in wet weather conditions during the afternoon. Sauber and BAR went to Circuit Ricardo Tormo for three days where aerodyamic and set-up testing was undertaken. Coulthard was scheduled to join Wurz during the session but withdrew because of food poisoning. Irvine was quickest on the third and final days of testing. Arrows elected not to perform any testing and concentrated on work on aerodynamics at their headquarters at Leafield.|$|E
50|$|However, {{over the}} past two decades, coarse bubble <b>diffusers</b> have been used less frequently, {{primarily}} due to the ever increasing cost of energy and the availability of more reliable, highly efficient fine bubble <b>diffusers.</b> Manufacturers of diffused aeration systems claim that converting from coarse bubble to fine bubble system should yield a 50 percent energy cost savings. Specifically, in aeration tanks, a system that utilizes coarse bubble <b>diffusers</b> requires 30 to 40 percent more process air than a fine bubble diffused air system to provide the same level of treatment. The exception would be in secondary treatment (or side processing) phases. In these processing tanks, floc particles, sediment and carbonate buildup tend to plug or clog the small air release openings on the fine bubble <b>diffusers.</b> Because of their small air openings, fine bubble <b>diffusers</b> cease to have an advantage. Currently, coarse bubble <b>diffusers</b> are the mainstay solution.|$|R

Ceramics are suitable for this purpose, often involving dispersion of fine air or gas bubbles through the porous ceramic into a liquid. The smaller the bubbles, the more gas is exposed to the liquid increasing the gas transfer efficiency. <b>Diffusers</b> or spargers can also be designed into the system to cause turbulence or mixing if desired.|$|R

5|$|Nelson Piquet was {{the only}} driver not {{to start with the}} softer {{compound}} dry-weather tyres on a track which was still drying from morning rain, with the Brazilian opting for the harder tyre available. There was a strong chance of showers predicted during the race. Several cars were slow away on the slippery track, most notably Kovalainen. The main beneficiaries off the line were Piquet and Trulli, who each gained five places. Trulli was hit from behind at the first corner by Bourdais, who also had a quick start. The Toyota suffered <b>diffuser</b> and gearbox damage from the incident, spinning later in the lap. Kovalainen and Heidfeld also collided at the start. This allowed Alonso to gain several places. Sebastian Vettel locked his brakes and ran wide, losing two places. Fisichella collided with Nakajima on the first lap and had to pit to fix a broken front wing and punctures. Hamilton led from Räikkönen who managed to pass his Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa on the Kemmel straight.|$|E
5|$|Some teams {{modified}} {{their cars}} {{in preparation for}} the event. Red Bull and Williams revised their brake ducts. Williams team changed their brake ducts at the front to improve airflow inside the tyres and direct the duct towards their car's central section more efficiently. Red Bull's brake ducts, which had been changed for the third consecutive Grand Prix, reintroduced a small fin seen at the Singapore Grand Prix; for Korea two aerodynamic fins were fitted and a larger duct was introduced. McLaren modified a version of their front wings first introduced in Singapore. The team added a vertical gurney flap and an additional vertical slot at the front wing endplate to improve airflow outside the front tyres and increase the amount of downforce and therefore grip produced by the bodywork. The team also brought a new rear wing and tested a new revision of their F-duct system that débuted at the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka. Ferrari revised their <b>diffuser</b> with curved profiles and one large middle plate designed to improve the extraction of air {{from the bottom of the}} F10. As in Suzuka, Toro Rosso ran an F-duct system in the Friday practice sessions.|$|E
5|$|Button {{scored the}} car's first points in Monaco, with an eighth-place finish. He later {{attributed}} the result to having {{confidence in the}} car, noting that he could raise the ride height at {{the front end of}} the car and brake heavily without locking the brakes or bottoming out and hitting the road, but without compromising the performance of the car when turning in to the apex of a corner. However, in the following races in Canada and Austria, the team's struggles came to a head as they were forced to reduce the power output of the engine to levels that had not been used since Australia, and could not therefore provide a competitive package for the long straights and slow corners of the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve and Red Bull Ring. In addition, with their arrival in Austria, both Button and Alonso had used up their quota of engine components for the season, which combined with unscheduled gearbox changes, resulted in both drivers receiving twenty-five place grid penalties. The team also introduced their first major aerodynamic updates for the season, replacing the snub nose of the original design with a squared-off front end similar to the designs of the Williams FW37 and Red Bull RB11. The rear of the floor was also revised, with a series of slots cut into the body in front of the rear wheels to change the air pressure flowing towards the <b>diffuser.</b> The team only saw limited running as Alonso retired on the opening lap after a collision with Kimi Räikkönen, but they were able to assess the new design at a post-race test. After enduring four consecutive retirements, Alonso scored his first point of the season with a tenth-place finish in Great Britain.|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} {{design program}} {{was developed to}} incorporate the suction slots in solving the potential flow equations with prescribed boundary conditions. Using the contour generated from this program two Griffith <b>diffusers</b> were tested having area ratios AR = 3 and 4. The inlet Reynolds number ranged from 600, 000 to 7 million. It {{was found that the}} slot suction required for metastable operation depends on the sidewall suction applied. Values of slot suction of 8 % of the inlet flow rate was required for AR = 4 with metastable condition, provided that enough sidewall suction was applied. For AR = 3, the values of slot suction was about 25 % lower than those required for AR = 4. For nearly all unseparated test runs, the effectiveness was 100 % and the exit flow was uniform. In addition to the Griffith <b>diffusers,</b> dump and cusp <b>diffusers</b> of comparable area ratios were built and tested. The results obtained from these <b>diffusers</b> were compared with those of the Griffith <b>diffusers.</b> Flow separation occurred in all test runs with the dump and cusp <b>diffusers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Surface {{diffusivity}} of lateral walls {{affects the}} distribution of a sound field on concert hall acoustics. The design elements of <b>diffusers</b> in concert halls are <b>diffuser’s</b> geometrical shape, structural height, surface coverage, and installation position. Scattering and diffusion coefficients of the <b>diffusers</b> were measured in a 1 : 10 reverberation chamber. The <b>diffusers</b> were applied to scale model concert halls with different design elements of <b>diffusers.</b> Acoustical parameters such as RT, EDT, C 80, and G were calculated from the impulse responses. In addition, the numbers peaks (Np) within - 20 dB from the amplitude of direct sound were calculated to evaluate the diffuseness in the halls. As results, <b>diffusers</b> caused decrease of RT, EDT and G, and contributed to decrease of relative standard deviations (RSD) of the parameters.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine upgrades Honda introduced for the , McLaren brought a new aerodynamic package for the MP4-30 which revised the front wing to increase downforce, altered the turning vanes to improve air flow over the front splitter, and adopted a concept pioneered by Ferrari to the rear floor designed to reduce the impact of airflow washing over the rear wheels and disrupting the rear <b>diffuser,</b> which in turn opened up {{a wider range of}} set-up options for the ride height and rake, or the angle between the front and rear ride height. These updates were designed to bring the MP4-30 in line with the designs developed by other teams. With the engine and aerodynamic updates, the team had hoped to compete for points on merit, and while Alonso clashed with Felipe Massa on the opening lap, he was running as high as fifth on the closing stages—and was on course to replicate the team's best result of the season—before suffering a loss of power and slipping back down the order to finish eleventh. With Alonso out of the points, Button was promoted to sixth. The race also saw what would be the car's best qualifying performance as Alonso started eleventh, while the six points Button scored saw the team close to within ten points of Sauber in the World Constructors' Championship. However, the result also meant that McLaren had endured its longest winless streak of fifty-three races, previously set between the 1977 Japanese Grand Prix and the 1981 British Grand Prix. Despite the progress that the team made over the previous rounds, the MP4-30's struggles continued in Mexico, with both drivers eliminated early in qualifying, and Jenson Button setting a new record for grid penalties, changing enough parts to warrant a seventy-place penalty. Alonso retired from the race with an incurable ERS problem that the team had identified the night before and Button finished fourteenth overall.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the exhaust outlet changed {{so that it was}} now angled upwards toward the rear wing instead of downwards to face the rear <b>diffuser</b> so as to make the practice of using exhaust blown diffusers—passing exhaust gasses over the rear <b>diffuser</b> to improve the car's downforce—extremely difficult to achieve.|$|E

40|$|What is aeration? Aeration {{is a step}} in {{wastewater}} treatment where air is added to wastewater for mixing purposes and to enhance biological growth. The purpose of aeration is to dissolve oxygen into wastewater so that the microorganisms can utilize it while they break down organic material. What is fine bubble aeration? Fine bubble aeration is a subsurface form of diffusion in which air is introduced in the form of very small bubbles to aid or enhance the treatment of wastewater. Air flows from a pipe into <b>diffusers</b> located {{at the bottom of a}} tank. These <b>diffusers</b> have numerous small openings (known as pores) through which air flows into the wastewater in the tank. In the past, various diffusion devices have been classified as either fine bubble or coarse bubble based on how efficiently they transferred oxygen to the wastewater. Since it is difficult to clearly distinguish between fine and coarse bubbles, diffused aeration systems have been classified based on the physical characteristics of the equipment. In a fine bubble aeration system, several <b>diffusers</b> are mounted or screwed into a header pipe that may run along the length or width of the tank or on a short manifold mounted on a movable pipe. These <b>diffusers</b> come in various shapes and sizes, such as discs, tubes, domes, and plates. The common types of coarse bubble <b>diffusers</b> are fixed orifices, valved orifices, and static tubes. The bubble size of these <b>diffusers</b> is larger than the porous <b>diffusers,</b> thus, lowering the oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE). Fine pore <b>diffusers</b> (discs, tubes, domes, and plates) are usually made from ceramic, plastic, or flexible perforated membranes. Although many materials can be used to make fine pore <b>diffusers,</b> only these few are being used due to cost considerations, specific characteristics, market size, and other factors.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} {{acoustic}} requirements for performers {{of classical music}} proved that early reflections were of critical importance for good ensemble conditions. However, strong early reflections may produce an unpleasant tone quality. <b>Diffusers</b> are sometimes used to reduce the negative effects caused by large specularly reflecting surfaces. The {{aim of the research}} project is to better understand what happens when <b>diffusers</b> are applied to the enclosure walls of a stage in a concert hall. Two aspects are examined: the changes produced to the sound field measured on the orchestra platform, {{and the manner in which}} musicians perceive diffuse early reflections in comparison with specular early reflections. Results of objective measurements show that the most noticeable property of <b>diffusers</b> on the early sound field is the smoothing of the impulse response. <b>Diffusers</b> attenuate strong early reflections. Besides, <b>diffusers</b> give a better sound energy distribution by providing reflections outside the specular sector: the standard deviation of several acoustic parameters is somewhat smaller with <b>diffusers.</b> It was found that <b>diffusers</b> do not eliminate comb filter effects and that they do not have a great influence on EEL, ST and clarity. The subjective aspect resulting in the greatest consensus among the subjects is the following. The overall tone quality is improved by <b>diffusers.</b> The overall sound quality is influenced by the amplitude of early reflections and by the reception angle of the reflections. <b>Diffusers</b> may also affect articulation, clarity, self and mutual hearing, but to a minor extent. Musicians' requirements regarding the fine structure of early reflections differ according to the size of the ensemble who is performing, the room volume, the power and directivity of the instruments played, and the type of music (or desired tone quality) ...|$|R
50|$|Often in non-Newtonian or pseudoplastic fluids, {{such as a}} {{digester}} {{with high}} solids concentration, it does make sense to use coarse bubble <b>diffusers</b> rather than fine bubble <b>diffusers,</b> due to the larger bubbles' ability to shear through more viscous wastewater.|$|R
