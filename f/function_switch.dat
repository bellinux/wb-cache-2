Sixteen signalboxes are fitted with route control relay/solid state interlocking systems and hardwired panels, and three are equipped solely with computerised, VDU-based route control. A few other signalling installations exist outside the RailCorp network, under the control of other rail operators.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Timely {{administration}} of the first dose, dosage adjustment to renal <b>function,</b> <b>switch</b> from intravenous to oral administration, and streamlining are important aspects of rational antibiotic prescription. The goals {{of this study were}} to investigate all of these variables, compare them with predefined quality standards, and implement improvement with specific interventions. METHODS: At the departments of internal medicine, surgery, and neurology and the emergency department of a tertiary referral university medical center, all consecutive patients receiving therapeutic antibiotics were enrolled. Dosages, timing of first doses, dosing intervals, administration routes, and adjustment of the chosen drug to clinical data were investigated. After the preintervention period, barriers to change were identified, followed by specific interventions and a postintervention measurement. RESULTS: In the preintervention and postintervention periods, 247 and 250 patients were enrolled, receiving 563 and 598 antibiotic prescriptions, respectively. The mean time from the order to first dose at the wards improved from 2. 7 to 1. 7 hours in potentially severe cases (P =. 003). Dosage adjustment to renal function remained unchanged at 45 % vs 52 % (P =. 09) of cases where necessary. Switching of therapy from intravenous to oral improved from 46 % to 62 % (P =. 03) and was performed a mean of 1. 6 days earlier (P =. 002). Streamlining was performed correctly in most cases, and thus no interventions were necessary. CONCLUSIONS: Timing of antibiotic therapy and switch therapy may be improved with a combination of interventions. To improve poor adjustment of dosing to renal function, other strategies are needed. In our setting, streamlining was already correct in most cases...|$|E
40|$|In 2012, over 157, 000 establishments {{employed}} 833, 919 automotive technicians in the U. S. Auto technicians play {{an important}} role in ensuring the safety of our cars. However, technicians encounter a number of dangers in their workplace when dealing with passenger vehicles that range in weight from about 2, 200 to 3, 300 lbs., depending upon the make and model. Nationally, there were 71 fatal injuries reported in the automotive repair and maintenance industry in 2012. 3 The Kentucky (KY) Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (KY FACE) program-funded by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) -investigated a death of a 50 -year-old certified master technician who was struck by a car while sitting at a desk in a dealership's service bay. An auto technician working in the service bay was preparing a vehicle for an oil change when he mistook a handicapped-accessible accelerator pedal for the brake pedal. The handicapped-accessible pedal, which can be removed, had a left foot accelerator made for individuals who have lost the ability to use their right foot. Mistaking the accelerator pedal for the brake pedal caused the vehicle to strike the victim from behind and pin him against his desk and a wall causing blunt force injuries. After calling 911, an employee with emergency medical technician experience, rushed to the scene, assessed the situation, and covered him to prevent shock until emergency responders arrived. On the way to the hospital, the victim suffered cardiac arrest and died from his injuries. The KY FACE program investigator evaluated the incident and produced the report "Auto Technician Mistakes Handicapped Accessible Accelerator Pedal for Brake Pedal and Fatally Pins Co-Worker". The report identified two key recommendations to prevent future incidents from occurring: (1) removal of handicapped-accessible equipment prior to operation; and (2) moving office spaces away from car servicing areas. Impact The FACE report was emailed to 45 car dealerships in Kentucky and 11 handicapped-accessible gas pedal manufacturers. Based on the report, Veigel North America LLC Mobility Products & Design redesigned their Left Foot Accelerator, Model 3545, to retrofit a vehicle's steering column with a key switch. When starting a vehicle with the redesigned pedal, the system defaults to a standard, factory pedal. To activate the left accelerator pedal, a driver must turn the key switch on and press the accelerator <b>function</b> <b>switch</b> to the left. This modification eliminates the need to remove the pedal for servicing and prevents unintended drivers from using the left foot accelerator. The redesigned pedal was introduced at the National Mobility Equipment Dealers Conference in February 2015 and is anticipated to be available to the public in June 2015. Beyond Veigel's modification to the handicapped-accessible pedal, the car dealership where the incident occurred established new employee policies based on the FACE report recommendations. The new policies require employees to remove all accessibility equipment on vehicles before any work is started and perform all administrative duties in an area away from the service area. Taken together, the redesign of the handicapped-accessible gas pedal and establishment of employee policies will aid in the safety of auto technicians. NIOSHTIC No 2004628...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that in {{implementations}} of sliding mode controllers using hysteresis comparators, when the hysteresis band amplitude tends to zero the real dynamics tends to the ideal sliding dynamics. However, in real systems physical limitations do not allow to effectively lower this value at will, and a steady state error is likely to appear. In this paper we relate this error with a non zero average value of the <b>switching</b> <b>function</b> in each <b>switching</b> period: it is shown that, in linear systems, when the controller has a constant switching frequency and the <b>switching</b> <b>function</b> is periodic, the average value of the difference between real and ideal steady state dynamics is proportional to the average value of the <b>switching</b> <b>function.</b> Hence, when this average value is non zero an average steady state error appears, while a zero average value for the <b>switching</b> <b>function</b> entails no average steady state error. The proof is carried out using a regular form approach, and the result is exemplified in a buck converter. Simulation results show that when the <b>switching</b> <b>function</b> is periodic and shows a piecewise linear behavior within the hysteresis band, thus guaranteeing zero average value, the average state error disappears. In turn, when this piecewise linear character is lost and the <b>switching</b> <b>function</b> has non zero mean value, an average steady state error arises. Postprint (published version...|$|R
