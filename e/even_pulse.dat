By counting two characters (2 x 180 =360) {{to the right}} of each 'L' or 'R', the cylinders that fire with 360 degree crankshaft rotational angle offset are shown to be located on opposite banks. If the exhaust manifold is designed to merge two exhaust ports on a bank into one exit as was common in the designs in the past, the pulse spacing becomes irregular, which causes uneven filling of intake into cylinders and the characteristic 'burble' of exhaust note on older flat-four engines. Subaru developed an [...] "equal lengths, <b>even</b> <b>pulse</b> spacing" [...] exhaust system with exhaust pipes connecting {{the left and the right}} banks for WRC competition in the 1990s, and incorporated this design into production Legacys in 2003, Foresters in 2005 and Imprezas in 2007.

The Impreza WRX and WRX STI still have unequal length exhaust pipes to feed the turbo sitting in the corner of the engine bay, and still have the characteristic burble.

40|$|Several {{significant}} wave propagation {{problems in the}} fields of nonlinear optics and hydrodynamics are studied in this thesis. In optics, the physical model considered is the two-core optical fiber (TCF), which is an essential component of lightwave technology. In hydrodynamics, the motion of a wave packet on the free surface of water of finite depth allowing modulations from two mutually perpendicular and horizontal directions, governed by the famous Davey-Stewartson (DS) equations, is taken into account. The main contributions of this thesis are: In optics, the effects of the intermodal dispersion (IMD) and the birefringence induced effects, both of which always exist in the TCFs, have been ignored in the previous studies of the modulation instability (MI) of continuous waves (CWs) in the TCFs. In this thesis, a detailed analysis of these effects on the MI spectra has been done. It is found that IMD does not seriously affect the MI spectra of the symmetric/antisymmetric CW states, but can significantly modify the MI spectra of the asymmetric CW states. In exploring the birefringence induced effects, a particular class of asymmetric CW states, which admits analytical solutions and has no counterpart in the single-core fibers, is focused on. It is found that the MI spectra of a birefringent TCF in the normal dispersion regime can be distinctively different from those of a zero-birefringence TCF especially for the circular-birefringence TCF. All the findings of MI analysis can be well verified by the wave propagation dynamics. Another contribution of this thesis is that we find the dramatic pulse distortion and <b>even</b> <b>pulse</b> splitting phenomenon due to IMD in TCFs, which is unexpected in many situations, can be effectively suppressed and even avoided by Kerr nonlinearity, which has never been reported in the literatures in the studies of TCFs. In hydrodynamics, DS equations describe the evolution of weakly nonlinear, weakly dispersive wavepackets with slow spanwise dependences on a fluid of finite depth. Generally, DS equations are divided into two types e, i. e. DSI and DSII equations, depending on the specific fluid configurations (fluid depth, wavelength of the water wave, surface tension etc). Due to the importance of DS equations, many exact solutions have been derived by different nonlinear wave methods over the years in the literature. In this thesis, two new exact doubly periodic wave patterns of DS equations are derived by the use of properties of the theta functions, or equivalently, the Jacobi elliptic functions, and the corresponding solitary waves are also deduced in the long wave limits. The new feature of the two wave patterns found is that they can be applied to both DSI and DSII systems at the same time. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Several {{recent reports}} have {{identified}} the scientific requirements for a future soft x-ray light source, and a high-repetition-rate free-electron laser (FEL) facility that is responsive to these requirements {{is now on the}} horizon. R&D in some critical areas is needed, however, to demonstrate technical performance, thus reducing technical risks and construction costs. Such a facility most likely will be based on a CW superconducting linear accelerator with beam supplied by a high-brightness, high-repetition-rate photocathode electron gun operating in CW mode, and on an array of FELs to which the accelerated beam is distributed, each operating at high repetition rate and with <b>even</b> <b>pulse</b> spacing. Dependent on experimental requirements, the individual FELs can be configured for either self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE), seeded, or oscillator mode of operation, including the use of high-gain harmonic generation (HGHG), echo-enhanced harmonic generation (EEHG), harmonic cascade, or other configurations. In this White Paper we identify the overall accelerator R&D needs, and highlight the most important pre-construction R&D tasks required to value-engineer the design configuration and deliverables for such a facility. In Section 1. 4 we identify the comprehensive R&D ultimately needed. We identify below the highest-priority requirements for understanding machine performance and reduce risk and costs at this pre-conceptual design stage. Details of implementing the required tasks will be the subject of future evaluation. Our highest-priority R&D program is the injector, which must be capable of delivering a beam with bunches up to a nanocoulomb at MHz repetition rate and with normalized emittance {le} 1 mm {center_dot} mrad. This will require integrated accelerating structure, cathode, and laser systems development. Cathode materials will impact the choice of laser technology in wavelength and energy per pulse, as well as vacuum requirements in the accelerating structure. Demonstration experiments in advanced seeding techniques, such as EEHG, and other optical manipulations to enhance the FEL process are required to reduce technical risk in producing temporally coherent and ultrashort x-ray output using optical seed lasers. Success of EEHG in particular would result in reduced development and cost of laser systems and accelerator hardware for seeded FELs. With a 1. 5 - 2. 5 GeV linac, FELs could operate in the VUV-soft x-ray range, where the actual beam energy will be determined by undulator technology; for example, to use the lower energy would require the use of advanced designs for which undulator R&D is needed. Significant reductions in both unit costs and accelerator costs resulting from the lower electron beam energy required to achieve lasing at a particular wavelength could be obtained with undulator development. Characterization of the wakefields of the vacuum chambers in narrow-gap undulators will be needed to minimize risk in ability to deliver close to transform limited pulses. CW superconducting RF technology for an FEL facility with short bunches at MHz rate and up to mA average current will require selection of design choices in cavity frequency and geometry, higher order mode suppression and power dissipation, RF power supply and distribution, accelerating gradient, and cryogenics systems. R&D is needed to define a cost and performance optimum. Developments in laser technology are proceeding at rapid pace, and progress in high-power lasers, harmonic generation, and tunable sources will need to be tracked...|$|E
