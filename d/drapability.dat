However, preparation of fabrics with castor oil lubricants result in less yellowing and less fabric weight loss, {{as well as}} increased dyeing brilliance. Jute has a decreased strength when wet, and also becomes subject to microbial attack in humid climates. Jute can be processed with an enzyme {{in order to reduce}} some of its brittleness and stiffness. Once treated with an enzyme, jute shows an affinity to readily accept natural dyes, which can be made from marigold flower extract. In one attempt to dye jute fabric with this extract, bleached fabric was mordanted with ferrous sulphate, increasing the fabric's dye uptake value. Jute also responds well to reactive dyeing. This process is used for bright and fast coloured value-added diversified products made from jute.|$|E

The approach consists of analysing some mechanical properties and parameters of <b>drapability</b> using different methods from two different points of research areaČ knowledge bases and numerical modelling using the finite element method.

Characterization of fabrics on their preforming qualities – which will be referred to as <b>drapability</b> in this paper – is necessary to tune the manufacturing process.

This paper, taking the flare skirt as an example, discusses the draping ability of six kinds of different fabric slitting under the conditions of bare chip and adhesive through the experiment. The study shows that the whole modeling of the skirt pieces after adhesion with fusible interlining, will show the changes of the reduced <b>drapability</b> and the reduced angular line numbers and the formed wave’s position dot will move downward. The length of wave will be shortened, the overall width will be widened and the <b>drapability</b> will be worse. The morphology of the bottom wing will have obvious change, that is the bottom wing will become larger and the wave depth of bottom wing become larger. The wave arrangement of the skirt pieces after adhesion takes on the asymmetry condition and the pleating effect of the bottom wing will become worse.

Most studies on dyeing of silk have been focused on washing fastness [19], water consumption [20], and dye sources [21]. However, color fading and high water and energy consumption remain critical issues facing the conventional dyeing methods. We have developed novel coloration methods for silk based on noble metal NPs [22, 23]. Anisotropic silver NPs were prepared and assembled onto silk fibers through electrostatic interaction. In addition, gold NPs were in situ synthesized on silk by heating, realizing the coloration of silk fabrics.

40|$|Composite {{structural}} parts {{have been successfully}} introduced in high performance industries. Nowadays, also lower performance, high volume production industries {{are looking for the}} application of composites in their products.

Currently, however, extensive mechanical tests are needed to properly design a composite structure. This is a requirement the large volume industries typically do not have the resources nor the time for. Reducing the need for structural tests can only be done if reliable simulation techniques are available.

40|$|The {{design of}} 3 D {{component}} parts made of fiber-reinforced composites for load bearing applications demands a load oriented fiber alignement. During the draping of the textile an undefined displacement of fibers up to wrinkle formation occurs. One possibility to in-fluence fiber orientation during draping is the utilisation {{of the characteristics}} of different fabric weaves. By combining different weaves in a textile reinforcing fabric adjusted to the component part, gradient-drapability can be developed. This means that local zones with a high structural stability and zones with high <b>drapability</b> can be created in a textile semi-finished product. The design of these zones is done by simulation to produce a fabric structure suitable for the component part. For that purpose, material models for draping simulation developed at the Institute of Textile Machinery and High Performance Material Technology (ITM) are being improved.

The Mechanics of Materials and Structures research group at UGent develops finite element simulation tools to predict damage initiation and growth in textile composites, and makes use of embedded sensors to measure local strains and deformations in the composite. Micro-tomography measurements are particularly helpful in this regard for several reasons: 1) they provide the three-dimensional geometry of the textile reinforcement architecture, which is imported in finite element simulations for further mechanical analysis, 2) cracks can be visualized in a non-destructive manner, because embedding and polishing thermoplastic composite samples for optical microscopy, is not an easy task and can lead to an altered state of the cracks, 3) the embedded sensors can be visualized very easily, and their correct alignment and position can be verified...|$|E
40|$|The high <b>drapability</b> of {{dry textile}} fabrics being used {{together}} with resin infusion processes {{is both a}} major advantage and a major challenge for the quality and mechanical performance of a FRP-structure. In this paper the draping of a Non Crimped Fabric (NCF) {{over the surface of}} a double-curved structure and the infiltration using the VARI-Process will be presented. The draping process mainly benefits from a high shear deformation of the NCF, which may lead to wrinkles in the fabric, once certain limits have been exceeded. Furthermore, the fiber orientation between the single layers inside the NCF is affected and as a consequence of that the outer contour of the fabric changes. At the joints between two fabrics a discontinuity of the fiber orientation occurs, which is an important input for calculating the mechanical stresses. A commercial software was used to calculate the contours of the cut-outs and the fiber orientations in several plies to ensure an exact fit.

In {{the first step of}} the LSI process, a CFRP preform is made using common technologies like resin transfer moulding (RTM), autoclave technique or warm pressing. Subsequently, the CFRP preform is pyrolysed and infiltrated by molten silicon. Thereby, the silicon reacts with carbon, forming a SiC matrix, leading to the final C/C-SiC material. Up to now, carbon fibre 2 D woven fabrics have been used for the manufacture of thin walled, C/C-SiC structures like nose caps for thermal protection systems of spacecraft. However, for highly loaded, lightweight structures like nozzles or combustion chambers, the use of 2 D woven fabrics is critical, due to the inadequate <b>drapability</b> and the resulting, limited strength. Therefore, CFRP-preforms based on filament winding, a well known process for the industrial production of tubular structures, have been adapted to the LSI process. Thereby, the winding angle of the fibre was varied systematically. In the resulting C/C-SiC material a strong influence of the fibre orientation to the mechanical properties was observed.

However, when production volumes and/or the quality requirements increase, there is an urgent need for solutions to automate the layup process. In addition, the trend in designing composite structures with increasingly larger dimensions and more complex geometries requires advanced process planning tools to optimize process parameters and guarantee the feasibility of the layup process. This dissertation presents a three-phased study on the development of automated and optimized process planning tools for the layup of unidirectional fabrics onto complex three-dimensional mold surfaces. The first phase of the study introduces the development of a laser scanning based measurement system, with the capability of measuring in-plane shear and out-of-plane deformations of unidirectional fabrics at the resolution of tow level. Based on this fabric deformation measurement approach, the second phase of study analyzes the effects of process parameters on the generation of different deformation modes and the transformation between them. The findings from the analyses were further explored to provide generalized solutions for improving the process of fabric layup in the third phase of the study, where two process planning tools are presented: pre-shearing planning and in-process manipulation planning. It has been verified by both simulation and experiments that these process planning tools are effective in increasing the <b>drapability</b> of the fabrics and in securing a feasible layup plan. Implementation approaches in layup process automation and composite structure design for manufacturability are also presented.
