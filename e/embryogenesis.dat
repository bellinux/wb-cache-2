5|$|Aristotle's {{model of}} <b>embryogenesis</b> sought {{to explain how}} the {{inherited}} parental characteristics cause the formation and development of an embryo.|$|E
5|$|During <b>embryogenesis</b> the ear {{develops}} {{as three}} distinct structures: the inner ear, {{the middle ear}} and the outer ear. Each structure originates from a different germ layer: the ectoderm, endoderm and mesenchyme.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart is}} the first {{functional}} organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at about three weeks into <b>embryogenesis.</b> This early start is crucial for subsequent embryonic and prenatal development.|$|E
5|$|The larynx, trachea, bronchi {{and lungs}} {{that make up}} the {{respiratory}} tract, begin to form during the fourth week of <b>embryogenesis</b> from the lung bud which appears ventrally to the caudal portion of the foregut.|$|E
5|$|Fertilization by a spermatozoon, when it occurs, {{usually takes}} place in the ampulla, the widest section of the fallopian tubes. A fertilized egg {{immediately}} begins the process of <b>embryogenesis,</b> or development. The developing embryo takes about three days to reach the uterus and another three days to implant into the endometrium. It has usually reached the blastocyst stage at the time of implantation.|$|E
5|$|There is {{polyadenylation}} in the cytosol of some {{animal cell}} types, namely in the germ line, during early <b>embryogenesis</b> and in post-synaptic sites of nerve cells. This lengthens the poly(A) tail of an mRNA with a shortened poly(A) tail, {{so that the}} mRNA will be translated. These shortened poly(A) tails are often less than 20 nucleotides, and are lengthened to around 80–150 nucleotides.|$|E
5|$|Developmental biology can {{identify}} homologous structures that {{arose from the}} same tissue in <b>embryogenesis.</b> For example, adult snakes have no legs, but their early embryos have limb-buds for hind legs, which are soon lost as the embryos develop. The implication that the ancestors of snakes had hind legs is confirmed by fossil evidence: the Cretaceous snake Pachyrhachis problematicus had hind legs complete with hip bones (ilium, pubis, ischium), thigh bone (femur), leg bones (tibia, fibula) and foot bones (calcaneum, astragalus) as in tetrapods with legs today.|$|E
5|$|In normal development, {{endogenous}} sonic hedgehog signaling stimulates rapid {{proliferation of}} cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) {{in the external}} granule layer (EGL). Cerebellar development occurs during late <b>embryogenesis</b> and the early postnatal period, with CGNP proliferation in the EGL peaking during early development (postnatal day 7 in the mouse). As CGNPs terminally differentiate into cerebellum granule cells (also called cerebellar granule neurons, CGNs), they migrate to the internal granule layer (IGL), forming the mature cerebellum (by post-natal day 20 in the mouse). Mutations that abnormally activate Sonic hedgehog signaling predispose to cancer of the cerebellum (medulloblastoma) in humans with Gorlin Syndrome and in genetically engineered mouse models.|$|E
5|$|Studies on <b>embryogenesis</b> and {{developmental}} biology. Mutants {{are created by}} adding transposons into their genomes, or specific genes are deleted by gene targeting. By studying the changes in development these changes produce, scientists aim to understand both how organisms normally develop, and what can go wrong in this process. These studies are particularly powerful since the basic controls of development, such as the homeobox genes, have similar functions in organisms as diverse as fruit flies and man.|$|E
5|$|The {{puzzle of}} how {{embryonic}} development was controlled {{began to be}} solved using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. The step-by-step control of its <b>embryogenesis</b> was visualized by attaching fluorescent dyes of different colours to specific types of protein made by genes expressed in the embryo. A dye such as green fluorescent protein, originally from a jellyfish, was typically attached to an antibody specific to a fruit fly protein, forming a precise indicator of where and when that protein appeared in the living embryo.|$|E
5|$|EFS regulates T-cell {{function}} and maturation, preventing expansion of autoreactive clones and pathological immune responses. Two {{studies that have}} reported that EFS expression in medullar thymus epithelial cells is important for negative selection of T-cells during their development, which implies an important role of EFS in maintaining immune homeostasis and autoimmunity prevention. In these studies, mice with defective EFS progressed normally during <b>embryogenesis</b> but then developed massive inflammatory lesions in multiple tissues that bore a striking histological resemblance to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease. Mechanistically, EFS expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is crucial for their functional maturation and growth factor-mediated expansion. mTECs are important for proper T-cell maturation and negative selection of autoreactive clones, required for development of immunological self-tolerance.|$|E
5|$|For males, the {{reproductive}} {{system is the}} testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during <b>embryogenesis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The theory {{describes}} {{five major}} biological processes, namely metabolism, temperature regulation, information processing, <b>embryogenesis,</b> and inheritance. Each was defined in some detail, {{in some cases}} sufficient to enable modern biologists to create mathematical models of the mechanisms described. Aristotle's method, too, resembled the style of science used by modern biologists when exploring a new area, with systematic data collection, discovery of patterns, and inference of possible causal explanations from these. He did not perform experiments in the modern sense, but made observations of living animals and carried out dissections. He names some 500 species of bird, mammal, and fish; and he distinguishes dozens of insects and other invertebrates. He describes the internal anatomy of over a hundred animals, and dissected around 35 of these.|$|E
5|$|As a {{component}} of the female reproductive system, the cervix is derived from the two paramesonephric ducts (also called Müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of <b>embryogenesis.</b> During development, the outer parts of the two ducts fuse, forming a single urogenital canal that will become the vagina, cervix and uterus. The cervix grows in size at a smaller rate than the body of the uterus, so the relative size of the cervix over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than the body of the uterus in fetal life, twice as large during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than the uterus, after puberty. Previously it was thought that during fetal development, the original squamous epithelium of the cervix is derived from the urogenital sinus and the original columnar epithelium is derived from the paramesonephric duct. The point at which these two original epithelia meet is called the original squamocolumnar junction. New studies show, however, that all the cervical as well as large part of the vaginal epithelium are derived from Müllerian duct tissue and that phenotypic differences might be due to other causes.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen is {{the largest}} tagma of the insect, which {{typically}} consists of 11–12 segments and is less strongly sclerotized than the head or thorax. Each segment of the abdomen is represented by a sclerotized tergum and sternum. Terga are separated {{from each other and}} from the adjacent sterna or pleura by membranes. Spiracles are located in the pleural area. Variation of this ground plan includes the fusion of terga or terga and sterna to form continuous dorsal or ventral shields or a conical tube. Some insects bear a sclerite in the pleural area called a laterotergite. Ventral sclerites are sometimes called laterosternites. During the embryonic stage of many insects and the postembryonic stage of primitive insects, 11 abdominal segments are present. In modern insects there is a tendency toward {{reduction in the number of}} the abdominal segments, but the primitive number of 11 is maintained during <b>embryogenesis.</b> Variation in abdominal segment number is considerable. If the Apterygota are considered to be indicative of the ground plan for pterygotes, confusion reigns: adult Protura have 12 segments, Collembola have 6. The orthopteran family Acrididae has 11 segments, and a fossil specimen of Zoraptera has a 10-segmented abdomen.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} of the wing buds is of a thickening of the hypodermis, which {{can be observed in}} insect species as early the embryo, and in the earliest stages of the life cycle. During the development of morphological features while in the embryo, or <b>embryogenesis,</b> a cluster of cells grow underneath the ectoderm which later in development, after the lateral ectoderm has grown dorsally to form wind imaginal disc. An example of wing bud development in the larvae, can be seen in those of White butterflies (Pieris). In the second instar the histoblast become more prominent, which now form a pocket-like structure. As of the third and fourth instars, the histoblast become more elongated. This greatly extended and evaginated, or protruding, part is what becomes the wing. By the close of the last instar, or fifth, the wing is pushed out of the wing-pocket, although continues to lie under the old larval cuticle while in its prepupal stage. It is not until the butterfly is in its pupal stage that the wing-bud becomes exposed, and shortly after eclosion, the wing begins to expand and form its definitive shape.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} {{develops in}} {{the third week of}} <b>embryogenesis</b> from interactions between the diencephalon part of the brain and the nasal cavity. The brain cells secrete FGF-8, Wnt5a and BMP-4, and the oral cavity BMP-2. Together, these cellular signals stimulate a group of cells from the oral cavity to form Rathke's pouch, which becomes independent of the nasal cavity and develops into the anterior pituitary; this process includes the suppression of production of a protein called Sonic hedgehog by the cells of Rathke's pouch. The cells then differentiate further into the various hormone-producing cells of the pituitary. This requires particular transcription factors that induce the expression of particular genes. Some of these transcription factors {{have been found to be}} deficient in some forms of rare combined pituitary hormone deficiencies (CPHD) in childhood. These are HESX1, PROP1, POU1F1, LHX3, LHX4, TBX19, SOX2 and SOX3. Each transcription factor acts in particular groups of cells. Therefore, various genetic mutations are associated with specific hormone deficiencies. For instance, POU1F1 (also known as Pit-1) mutations cause specific deficiencies in growth hormone, prolactin and TSH. In addition to the pituitary, some of the transcription factors are also required for the development of other organs; some of these mutations are therefore also associated with specific birth defects.|$|E

25|$|MKK7 is {{involved}} in the development of epithelial tissues such as skin and lungs, and also the developing teeth, during early <b>embryogenesis</b> in mice. Experiments also indicate that MKK7 in addition to MKK4 are required for mammalian body plan organization during <b>embryogenesis.</b> MKK7 has also been suggested to function as a Metastase Suppressor Gene (MSG) by promoting tumor dormancy at the metastatic site. In small mammals, stress like pressure overload can cause cardiac hypertrophy and failure if MKK7 is knocked out.|$|E
25|$|The tongue {{begins to}} develop in the fourth week of <b>embryogenesis</b> from a median swelling, the median tongue bud known as the tuberculum impar, of the first {{pharyngeal}} arch.|$|E
25|$|The TGF beta family include: TGFβ1, TGFβ2, TGFβ3. Like the BMPs, TGF betas are {{involved}} in <b>embryogenesis</b> and cell differentiation, {{but they are also}} involved in apoptosis, as well as other functions. They bind to TGF-beta receptor type-2 (TGFBR2).|$|E
25|$|This family {{includes}} TGF-β1, TGF-β2, TGF-β3, and TGF-β5. They {{are involved}} in positively and negatively regulation of cell division, {{the formation of the}} extracellular matrix between cells, apoptosis, and <b>embryogenesis.</b> They bind to TGF-β type II receptor (TGFBRII).|$|E
25|$|<b>Embryogenesis</b> in Drosophila {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied, as its small size, short generation time, and large brood size makes it ideal for genetic studies. It is also unique among model organisms in that cleavage occurs in a syncytium.|$|E
25|$|The Wnt {{signaling}} pathways {{are critical}} in cell-cell signaling during normal development and <b>embryogenesis</b> and required for maintenance of adult tissue, {{therefore it is}} not difficult to understand why disruption in Wnt signaling pathways can promote human degenerative disease and cancer.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} activins: Activin A, Activin B and Activin AB. Activins are {{involved}} in <b>embryogenesis</b> and osteogenesis. They also regulate many hormones including pituitary, gonadal and hypothalamic hormones as well as insulin. They are also nerve cell survival factors.|$|E
25|$|Embryo {{transfer}} can {{be performed}} after various durations of embryo culture, conferring different stages in <b>embryogenesis.</b> The main stages at which embryo transfer is performed are cleavage stage (day 2 to 4 after co-incubation) or the blastocyst stage (day 5 or 6 after co-incubation).|$|E
25|$|Cajal–Retzius cells (CR cells) (also {{known as}} Horizontal cell of Cajal) are a {{heterogeneous}} population of morphologically and molecularly distinct reelin-producing cell {{types in the}} marginal zone/layer I of the developmental cerebral cortex and in the immature hippocampus of different species and at different times during <b>embryogenesis</b> and postnatal life.|$|E
25|$|Activation-induced {{death of}} primary T-lymphocytes and other {{important}} constituents of the immune response are caspase-independent and necrotic by morphology; hence, current researchers have demonstrated that the occurrence of necrotic cell death can not only occur during pathological processes but also during normal processes such as tissue renewal, <b>embryogenesis,</b> and immune response.|$|E
25|$|Some glial cells {{function}} {{primarily as}} the physical support for neurons. Others regulate the internal {{environment of the}} brain, especially the fluid surrounding neurons and their synapses, and nutrify neurons. During early <b>embryogenesis,</b> glial cells direct the migration of neurons and produce molecules that modify the growth of axons and dendrites.|$|E
25|$|At ten (10) {{weeks of}} gestation, the cells {{differentiate}} into muscle, cartilage, and bone. If this important, early facial <b>embryogenesis</b> fails, it {{might result in}} anomalies such as choanal atresia (absent or closed passage), medial nasal clefts (fissures), or lateral nasal clefts, nasal aplasia (faulty or incomplete development), and polyrrhinia (double nose).|$|E
25|$|DHT is biologically {{important}} for sexual differentiation {{of the male}} genitalia during <b>embryogenesis,</b> maturation of the penis and scrotum at puberty, growth of facial, body, and pubic hair, sebum production, and development and maintenance of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles. It is produced from the less potent testosterone by the enzyme 5α-reductase in select tissues, and is the primary androgen in the genitals, prostate gland, seminal vesicles, skin, and hair follicles.|$|E
25|$|The use of cAMP as a {{chemotactic}} {{agent is}} not established {{in any other}} organism. In developmental biology, {{this is one of}} the comprehensible examples of chemotaxis, which is important for an understanding of human inflammation, arthritis, asthma, lymphocyte trafficking, and axon guidance. Phagocytosis is used in immune surveillance and antigen presentation, while cell-type determination, cell sorting, and pattern formation are basic features of <b>embryogenesis</b> that may be studied with these organisms.|$|E
25|$|Lefty is a {{regulator}} of TGFβ and {{is involved}} in the axis patterning during <b>embryogenesis.</b> It {{is also a member of}} the TGF superfamily of proteins. It is asymmetrically expressed in the left side of murine embryos and subsequently plays a role in left-right specification. Lefty acts by preventing the phosphorylation of R-SMADs. It does so through a constitutively active TGFβ type I receptor and through a process downstream of its activation.|$|E
25|$|Vascular remodelling is {{a process}} which begins at day 21 of human <b>embryogenesis,</b> when an {{immature}} heart begins contracting, pushing fluid through the early vasculature. This first passage of fluid initiates a signal cascade based on physical cues including shear stress and circumferential stress, which {{is necessary for the}} remodelling of the vascular network, arterial-venous identity, angiogenesis, and the regulation of genes through mechanotransduction. This embryonic process is necessary for the future stability of the mature vascular network.|$|E
25|$|The {{gallbladder}} develops from an endodermal outpouching of the embryonic gut tube. Early in development, {{the human}} embryo has three germ layers and abuts an embryonic yolk sac. During {{the second week}} of <b>embryogenesis,</b> as the embryo grows, it begins to surround and envelop portions of this sac. The enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract. Sections of this foregut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the oesophagus, stomach, and intestines.|$|E
