40|$|In {{judicial}} review on Article 9 of Law No. 42 <b>of</b> 2008 on <b>Election</b> <b>of</b> President and <b>Vice-President</b> which regulates presidential threshold, the Constitutional Court declined it {{since it is}} an open legal policy mandated by Article 6 paragraph (5) of the 1945 Constitution that the administration <b>of</b> President and <b>Vice-President</b> <b>election</b> will be further regulated in a Law. This reason is deemed insufficient as the Article 6 paragraph (5) regulates procedures (phases of the process), not requirements for candidates of President and Vice President to be eligible on participating in the election. Moreover, Article 9 of Law No. 42 of 2008 potentially expands the norms as stipulated in Article 6 A paragraph (2) of the 1945 Constitution in which the candidates for President and Vice President shall be nominated by a political party or coalition of political parties participating in the election prior to the election without any other frills (the threshold). The term presidential threshold {{that is being used}} up until now is actually incorrect term; instead, presidential candidacy threshold should be considered as the more appropriate term.
