The detailed stability analysis of underground powerhouse is done using empirical, analytical and numerical methods. A study has been done to assess the cost optimisation by taking into account the reduction in cost of lining and increase in cost due to increased cost of excavation and rock support. Hydraulic equivalent section has been used in cost optimisation calculations Stability analysis of the underground power house complex of Etalin hydroelectric project consisting of three caverns housing powerhouse, transformer and surge chamber is done and rock support designed. The power house has three caverns located at a depth of 400 m aligned parallel at a spacing of 50 m. The size of powerhouse cavern is 352 m (L) x 23. 5 m (W) x 59. 73 m (H). The total size of transformer cavern is 349. 6 m (L) x 16. 5 m (W) x 24. 3 m (H). Downstream surge chambers of size 165 m (L) x 13 m (W) x 46 m (H) for Dri limb and 110 m (L) x 13 m (W) x 46 m (H) for Tangon limb are provided. The empirical methods include basic rock mass classification methods such as RQD, Q-system, RMR and GSI method based on the field investigation data and geological mapping records.. Rock support design also done suing Q-system. Engineering and mechanical properties of intact rock were recorded from the laboratory tests on rock core samples from drill holes. Rock mass strength and modulus values have been calculated using various empirical relations. The Hoek and Brown rock mass strength parameters were determined using Roclab program. The analytical methods include assessment of stress related problems by calculation of tangential stress using Kirsch&# 146;s analogy, Hoek and Brown practical method. Rock burst impact depth is calculated form Martin and Christiansson. The adequacy of width of rock pillar was verified using Brown and Brady&# 146;s tributary area theory {{and with the help of}} Martin and Maybee&# 146;s study on rock pillars. The numerical methods include Unwedge and Phase 2 programs. Unwedge is used to determine potential wedge failures and spot bolting design for stabilising the wedges. The Phase 2 program has been used to find the principal stress situation, displacemnts, strength factor, volumetric strain, yield zone and rock support design. The numerical modelling has been modelled for varying in-situ stress situations, varying rock mass quality, boundary conditions, and support types in modelling. </p...|$|R
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} to focus on the two <b>head</b> <b>race</b> <b>tunnels</b> within the Melado HPP, Chile. The {{upstream}} tunnel is called Castillo 7800 m long and the downstream tunnel is called Vallical 8800 m long. The feasibility study of this project was carried in 2010. The resulting report from this study was used as a basis for this thesis. Along with all the background information obtained from the feasibility studies, there are some other sources gotten from field investigation tests carried out {{after the end of the}} feasibility report. Based on all the information collected, a new rock mass classification was carried out, identifying all the geological stretches for both tunnels. This classification was undertaken according to the RMR system (Bieniawski, 1973) and the Q-system (NGI, 1974). The support required for both tunnels was estimated mainly based on empirical rock support methods. Numerical model by means of software Phase 2 as well as ground behavior analysis were carried out to provide a better understanding of actual problems expected during excavation that are not always cover by the empirical methods. Once there was a clear understating of the rock masses involved in both tunnels along with their corresponding rock support, some analysis related to the tunnels were performed to improve the economical benefit of the whole project. The first economic analysis undertaken was the optimum cross section for Drill & Blast excavation method. A detail analysis that systematizes the cost and advance rate involved in the round cycle of the Drill & Blast excavation method and rock support was used. A thorough analysis of energy losses was also carried out as well, making a distinction between unlined, shotcrete lined and reinforced shotcrete ribs tunnel stretches. The existing cross section of 6. 9 m horse shoe shape tunnel turned out to be very small. The new optimum cross section for Castillo tunnel was 8. 7 m diameter and 9 m diameter for Vallical tunnel. The second economic analysis was a tunnel alignment change in order to improve some blast design parameters in stretches where their tunnel axis orientation was close to predominant joint set. In any of the two tunnel stretches analyzed turned out to be economically convenient to extend the tunnel for this purpose, even though the safety factor for the crew was not included. Also, the convenience of extra adits was carried out. In fact, the layout of the feasibility report included one extra adit for each tunnel in order to have an earlier tunnel completion. The findings suggest that these adits are not economically convenient as long as the project s electromechanical equipments take 34 months from their manufacturing to their assembly on project cavern...|$|R
5000|$|The Loktak Hydropower Project on the Manipur River or Imphal River, {{with the}} Loktak Lake forming the head waters to provide {{regulated}} storage for power generation, {{was built in}} 1983 as a multipurpose project with power generation of 105 MW (3x35 MW) for power supply to Manipur, Nagaland, Assam, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Tripura, and lift irrigation to an area of 23000 ha in the Manipur valley. The main components of the project, as built, are, a) the Ithai barrage, across the Manipur river of 10.7 m height and 58.8 m length with three spillway bays, b) water conductor system for trans-basin diversion comprising an open channel of 2.323 km length, a cut and cover section of 1.077 km length (bed width 18 m, followed by a <b>Head</b> <b>Race</b> <b>Tunnel</b> of 3.81 m diameter (horseshoe type) and 6.62 km long to carry a discharge of [...] (...) for power generation and [...] for irrigation), c) a surge shaft, d) penstocks and e) a surface powerhouse and a tailrace channel on the right bank of the narrow Leimatak River with three units of 35 MW capacity each generating an annual energy of 448 GW·h (1.613 PJ). The downstream Loktak Power Project in cascade to utilize the regulated releases from the upper project for further power generation of 90 MW is proposed to be taken up for joint implementation by NHPC and the Government of Manipur.The project has invited severe criticism since the water level in the lake at the Ithai barrage is maintained throughout the year at FRL 786.5 m from considerations of power generation from the well planned water conductor system. The problem in the lake is, however, diverse; economic activities {{in and around the}} lake, and encroachments by 50,400 fishermen for extensive fishing activity are also cited to be some reasons. Other reasons for the distress situation in the lake are a) jhum (shifting) cultivation, b) extensive deforestation and unscientific land use practices in the catchment areas which bring large amount of silt into the lake and c) undefined ownership of the lake where the stakeholders are the districts of Imphal west district, Bishnupur and Thoubal causing lack of integrated approach to the lakes potential for providing benefits.|$|E

The prior knowledge of the prevailing stress field helps in the alignment and the design of support system for the underground cavern, estimation of grouting pressure in the dam foundation, design of steel liners for <b>Head</b> <b>Race</b> <b>Tunnel,</b> Penstock, etc. There are various methods of determination of in-situ stresses in rock mass. However it has been experienced that the hydrofracturing technique is the most convenient to conduct and interpret the test results. This paper briefly describes the various uses of stress measurements, details of hydraulic fracturing test system, test procedure adopted {{and the concept of}} hydrofracturing in arriving at the in-situ stresses of the rock mass. The results for the above applications conducted at four mega hydroelectric projects in India and neighbouring countries of Bhutan and Nepal located in the Himalayas are presented...|$|E

A Robbins main beam TBM is excavating a <b>head</b> <b>race</b> <b>tunnel</b> at Nedre R&# 248;ss&# 229;ga. Originally a probe drilling system was to be examined, but was never performed at site during working with the thesis. Therefore a theoretical part is included in this thesis with a brief discussion on exploiting established systems for probe drilling in TBM tunneling. It is suggested methods to predict performance from both NTNU and CSM prediction models. Also some suggestions on neuro fuzzy methods can be applied. The thesis is based on a literature study, field study and laboratory study. Data are acquired at the job site by the author. The field study and laboratory study are basis for a review of the NTNU prediction model. The laboratory tests used in NTNU model are performed and investigated as it was suspected that the boring process had impact on the rock samples. Disturbed and undisturbed samples from four different locations in the tunnel with representative geology have been tested and compared. It seems that the boring process have impact on the Brittleness Value, but in less than assumed. From field data the actual performance of the TBM at Nedre R&# 248;ss&# 229;ga are examined. The NTNU model and FullProf have been used to predict performance. Through comparisons between actual and predicted performance, it is likely to say that the NTNU prediction model performs well for the Nedre R&# 248;ss&# 229;ga project. It is shown that the impact of the fracturing is the most important parameter, as stated in existing literature. Cutter wear and life is also predicted well in homogenous rock mass, but weaker predicted in fractured rock mass. </p...|$|E
