Although a number of skyscrapers—most visibly the headquarters of AT, The Coca-Cola Company, and Bank of America—are visible from all points on campus, the campus itself has few buildings over four stories and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> greenery. This gives it a distinctly suburban atmosphere quite different from other Atlanta campuses {{such as that of}} Georgia State University.|$|E

25|$|The Angel dialect became extinct around 1900. A few {{records of}} it exist, showing it {{was similar to}} the South Jutlandic of the Sønderborg area in North Slesvig, across the Flensborg Fjord.

25|$|The {{vocabulary}} of Teochew shares {{a lot of}} similarities with Cantonese because of their continuous contact with each other. Like Cantonese, Teochew <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> monosyllabic words. However, ever since the standardisation of Modern Standard Chinese, Teochew has absorbed a lot of Putonghua vocabulary, which is predominantly polysyllabic. Also, Teochew varieties in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia have also borrowed extensively from Malay.|$|E
25|$|The {{energy density}} {{of a typical}} rocket {{propellant}} is often around one-third that of conventional hydrocarbon fuels; {{the bulk of the}} mass is (often relatively inexpensive) oxidizer. Nevertheless, at take-off the rocket <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> energy in the fuel and oxidizer stored within the vehicle. It is of course desirable that as much of the energy of the propellant end up as kinetic or potential energy of the body of the rocket as possible.|$|E

But he is also given to self-deception, and thoughtlessly causes Fanny pain, especially when he becomes attracted to Miss Crawford.

25|$|Medicare {{also has}} an {{important}} role driving changes in the entire health care system. Because Medicare pays for a huge share {{of health care in}} every region of the country, it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> power to set delivery and payment policies. For example, Medicare promoted the adaptation of prospective payments based on DRG’s, which prevents unscrupulous providers from setting their own exorbitant prices. Meanwhile, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has given Medicare the mandate to promote cost-containment throughout the health care system, for example, by promoting the creation of accountable care organizations or by replacing fee-for-service payments with bundled payments.|$|E
25|$|Wakefield pitched {{with what}} {{is said to be}} a slow sidearm motion, but is {{actually}} a ¾-overhand motion. This also revealed some of his pitches to hitters, because they can see his hand. Wakefield's primary pitch, the knuckleball, is normally thrown about 64–68mph and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> variance in how much it 'flutters'. The flutter of his knuckleball depended on a variety of factors including temperature, humidity, precipitation (both type and intensity), air resistance, wind speed, wind direction, the condition of the ball, and very small changes in his grip or the orientation of the seams. Wakefield also featured a 71–75mph fastball, a slow curve (57-61mph), and a slower version of his knuckleball (59-62mph).|$|E
500|$|The game <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> {{geographic}} {{variety in}} climate, flora, and, to some extent, fauna as well. Besides that, {{there is also}} some variety in politics and culture among the in-game populations, the combination of which adds to the uniqueness of different parts of the island. On top of that, there is an archaeological aspect to the game, which gives a certain degree of depth to the story as well as the option for further exploration. Additionally, there are various kinds of limits in visibility such as fog and dust, which are countered with [...] "clear day/night" [...] effects that also enhance visibility to some extent.|$|E

500|$|The Parliament also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> {{indirect}} influence, through non-binding {{resolutions and}} committee hearings, as a [...] "pan-European soapbox" [...] with {{the ear of}} thousands of Brussels-based journalists. There is also an indirect effect on foreign policy; the Parliament must approve all development grants, including those overseas. For example, the support for post-war Iraq reconstruction, or incentives for the cessation of Iranian nuclear development, must be supported by the Parliament. Parliamentary support was also required for the transatlantic passenger data-sharing deal with the United States. Finally, Parliament holds a non-binding vote on new EU treaties but cannot veto it. However, when Parliament threatened to vote down the Nice Treaty, the Belgian and Italian Parliaments said they would veto the treaty on the European Parliament's behalf.|$|E
500|$|Rider Haggard's writing {{style was}} the source of much {{criticism}} in reviews of She and his other works. His harshest critic was Augustus Moore, who wrote [...] "God help English literature when English people lay aside their Waverley novels, and the works of Defoe, Swift, Thackeray, Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot, and even Charles Reade for the penny dreadfuls of Mr Haggard"; adding, [...] "The man who could write 'he spoke to She' can have no ear at all". A more common sentiment was expressed by the review of She in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine: [...] "Mr. Rider Haggard is not an exquisite workman like Mr. [...] Stevenson, but he <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> power in his way, and rougher qualities which are more likely, perhaps, to 'take the town' than skill more delicate".|$|E

Oldman described his character as [...] "incorruptible, virtuous, strong, heroic, but understated." [...] Nolan explained that [...] " [...] has a great, triangular relationship between Harvey Dent and Gordon and Batman, and that's something we very much drew from." [...] Oldman added that [...] "Gordon <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> admiration for him at the end, but [...] is more than ever now the dark knight, the outsider. I'm intrigued now to see: If there is a third one, what he's going to do?" [...] On the possibility of another sequel, he said that [...] "returning to [...] is not dependent on whether the role was bigger than the one before." ...|$|E
