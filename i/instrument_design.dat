25|$|Development of the 2K22 {{anti-aircraft}} system {{began on}} 8 June 1970. At {{the request of}} the Soviet Ministry of Defence, the KBP <b>Instrument</b> <b>Design</b> Bureau in Tula, under the guidance of the appointed Chief Designer A. G. Shipunov, started work on a 30mm anti-aircraft system as a replacement for the 23mm ZSU-23-4.|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicle is}} {{designed}} by the Volgograd tractor factory and the armament {{was developed by the}} KBP <b>Instrument</b> <b>Design</b> Bureau unitary enterprise located in Tula. Kurganmashzavod is the official manufacturer of the vehicle. The only operator of the BMD-4 is Russia where it entered service in late 2004 and has been produced ever since then. In 2008, a modernized version, designated as the BMD-4M, was introduced with significant contributions from Kurganmashzavod; the designer of the BMP.|$|E
25|$|Photomultipliers {{were the}} first {{electric}} eye devices, being used to measure interruptions in beams of light. Photomultipliers are {{used in conjunction with}} scintillators to detect Ionizing radiation by means of hand held and fixed radiation protection instruments, and particle radiation in physics experiments. Photomultipliers are used in research laboratories to measure the intensity and spectrum of light-emitting materials such as compound semiconductors and quantum dots. Photomultipliers are used as the detector in many spectrophotometers. This allows an <b>instrument</b> <b>design</b> that escapes the thermal noise limit on sensitivity, and which can therefore substantially increase the dynamic range of the instrument.|$|E

25|$|To {{reduce the}} PAK FA's {{developmental}} risk {{and spread out}} associated costs, {{as well as to}} bridge the gap between it and older previous generation fighters, some of its technology and features, such as propulsion and avionics, were implemented in the Sukhoi Su-35S fighter, an advanced variant of the Su-27. The Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association (NAPO) is manufacturing the new multi-role fighter at Komsomol'sk-on-Amur along with Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association (KnAAPO), and final assembly is to take place at Komsomol'sk-on-Amur. Following a competition held in 2003, the Tekhnokompleks Scientific and Production Center, Ramenskoye Instrument Building Design Bureau, the Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of <b>Instrument</b> <b>Design</b> (NIIP), the Ural Optical and Mechanical Plant (UOMZ) in Yekaterinburg, the Polet firm in Nizhny Novgorod and the Central Scientific Research Radio Engineering Institute in Moscow were selected for the development of the PAK-FA's avionics suite. NPO Saturn is the lead contractor for the interim engines; Saturn and MMPP Salyut will compete for the definitive second stage engines.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{armament}} of the BMD-3 is the 30mm 2A42 autocannon in {{the form}} of the original BMP-2 turret. This autocannon is mounted on other vehicles, like the Ka-52 and Mi-28. The 2A42 autocannon is a dual selective feed cannon which is fitted with a distinct muzzle brake and manual weapons laying drives increasing accuracy and consistency. This muzzle brake reduces oscillation of the gun mount at the moment of a round being fired. The practical rate of fire is 200-300 rds/min (rounds per minute) while the cyclic rate of fire is over 550 rds/min. It fires rounds with a muzzle velocity of 960m/s. The BMD-3 has 500 rounds for the 30mm autocannon ready to be used with an additional 360 stowed inside. The maximum effective range when firing AP-T (armor-piercing-tracer) ammunition is 2000 m, and when firing HE-I (high-explosive-incendiary) ammunition is 4000 m against an area target. A 7.62×54mmR PKT machine gun is mounted coaxially on the right side of the main armament. This coaxial machine gun has a cyclic rate of fire of 800 rds/min and is also equipped with one belt of 2000 rounds. The KBP <b>Instrument</b> <b>Design</b> Bureau offers a drop-in one-man turret, called the Kliver turret, with a stabilized 2A72 30mm gun, four Kornet ATGM launchers, thermal sights, a coaxial 7.62mm PKT machine gun, and an improved fire control system.|$|E

2500|$|Development of the 9K37 [...] "Buk" [...] {{started on}} 17 January 1972 {{at the request}} of the Central Committee of the CPSU. The {{development}} team included many of the same institutions that had developed the previous 2K12 [...] "Kub" [...] (NATO reporting name [...] "Gainful", SA-6), including the Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of <b>Instrument</b> <b>Design</b> (NIIP) as the lead designer and the Novator design bureau, which was responsible for the development of the missile armament. In addition to the land-based system, a marine system was to be produced for the Navy: the 3S90 [...] "Uragan" [...] ( [...] ; hurricane) which also carries the SA-N-7 and [...] "Gadfly" [...] designations.|$|E
2500|$|Both primary armaments of the BMD-4 are all fitted {{into one}} turret {{known as the}} Bakhcha U (Russian: Бахча-У; [...] "Melon field") {{consisting}} of: a 100mm 2A70 rifled gun, a coaxial 30mm 2A72 autocannon, and a coaxial 7.62mm PKT machine gun. This module is designed by the KBP <b>Instrument</b> <b>Design</b> Bureau for motorized infantry units {{without the support of}} tanks and artillery. The Bakhcha-U turret is installable on the chassis of other military vehicles such as the BMP-2, BMP-3, and BTR-90. This turret has an unlimited traversal of 360° and a maximum elevation of 60°; the maximum depression is −6°. The majority of armored and unarmored targets can be engaged by at least two types of armament provided by the Bakhcha-U turret.|$|E
2500|$|Current satellite-based sensors are not {{designed}} to meet the accuracy requirements needed for climate change detection. Many sensors used for climate measurements were designed to meet operational weather needs and are not optimized for climate sampling. [...] These sensors, along with older instruments designed for climate, lack the on-board ability to test for systematic errors on orbit. The CLARREO mission will meet these goals through careful consideration of the <b>instrument</b> <b>design,</b> calibration traceability at all stages of development and operation, with spectral, spatial and temporal sampling focused specifically on the creation of climate records. Then after development of new cross-calibration methodologies far more accurate than those achieved today, CLARREO may serve as an in-orbit standard to provide reference intercalibration for missions like the broadband Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), operational sounders including the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), and imagers such as the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR).|$|E

2500|$|The dual 2 [...] 30mm cannons (as well as {{the later}} 2A38M) were {{designed}} by the KBP <b>Instrument</b> <b>Design</b> Bureau and manufactured by the Tulamashzavod Joint Stock Company. The cannons are fired alternatively with a combined rate of fire of between 3,900 and 5,000 rounds per minute (1,950 to 2,500 rpm for each gun), and have a muzzle velocity of 960m/s. Bursts of between 83 and 250 rounds are fired {{as determined by the}} target type, with an engagement range between 0.2 and 4.0km and to an altitude of about 3km. HE-T and HE-I shells are used and fitted with a A-670 time and impact fuze which includes an arming delay and self destruct mechanism. Sources vary on elevation capabilities (one estimate gives +85 to −9 degrees, while another +87 to −10 degrees), though this range allows the system to engage ground as well as aerial targets. The 2K22 can fire its cannons in two primary modes of operation, radar and optical. In radar mode, the target tracking is fully automatic, with the guns aimed using data from the radar. In optical mode, the gunner tracks the target through the 1A29 stabilized sight, with the radar providing range data. The 2K22 is reported to have a kill probability of 0.8 with cannon. The height of defeat for guns is 0–2000 meters—for missiles 10–3500 meters.|$|E
