Through a variational calculation using a trial condensate {{wave function}} and a nonlinear Schroedinger Lagrangian, we obtain the effective potential experienced by a vortex at an arbitrary {{position in the}} condensate, and find that an off-center vortex will move in a circular trajectory around the trap center. We find the frequency of this precession to be smaller than the <b>elementary</b> excitation <b>frequencies</b> in the cloud.

40|$|One of the {{important}} goals of Christian education is to train students {{to see the world}} through the lens of scripture. However, Christian schools are regularly graduating students who do not think from a distinctively biblical worldview. This study utilized comparative data analysis (Kruskal-Wallis test) to investigate the relationship between four independent variables and the biblical worldview of middle-school students as measured by the PEERS worldview test. The study examined the influence of type of <b>elementary</b> education, <b>frequency</b> of church attendance, personal faith commitment, and parent Christian belief on the PEERS test scores and religion subcategory scores of students enrolled in Christian middle-school. Results suggested significant relationships between frequency of church attendance and personal faith commitment and the PEERS composite scores and religion subcategory scores. Many of the students in this study demonstrated a commitment to faith-based practices, but their worldview was strongly secular humanist. The results suggest a gap between religion-based knowledge and practices and application of scripture to real life issues.

40|$|Abstract: For {{the past}} few years, a joint ISO/CCITT {{committee}} known as JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) has been working to establish the first international compression standard for continuous tone still images, both grayscale and color. JPEG’s proposed standard aims to be generic, to support {{a wide variety of}} applications for continuous tone images. To meet the differing needs of many applications, the JPEG standard includes two basic compression methods, each with various modes of operation. A DCT based method is specified for “lossy’ ’ compression, and a predictive method for “lossless’ ’ compression. JPEG features simple lossy technique known as the Baseline method, a subset of the other DCT based modes of operation. The discrete cosine transform (DCT) is a technique for converting a signal into <b>elementary</b> <b>frequency</b> components. It is widely used in image compression.

Auditory organs {{are used to}} detect intraspecific communicative signals and environmental sounds relevant to survival. To hear, terrestrial animals must convert the acoustic energy contained in the airborne sound pressure waves into neural signals. In mammals, spectral quality is assessed by the decomposition of incoming sound waves into <b>elementary</b> <b>frequency</b> components using a sophisticated cochlear system. Some neotropical insects like katydids (bushcrickets) have evolved biophysical mechanisms for auditory processing that are remarkably equivalent to those of mammals. Located on their front legs, katydid ears are small, yet are capable of performing several of the tasks usually associated with mammalian hearing. These tasks include air-to-liquid impedance conversion, signal amplification, and frequency analysis. Impedance conversion is achieved by a lever system, a mechanism functionally analogous to the mammalian middle ear ossicles, yet morphologically distinct. In katydids, the exact mechanisms supporting frequency analysis seem diverse, yet are seen to result in dispersive wave propagation phenomenologically {{similar to that of}} cochlear systems. Phylogenetically unrelated, katydids and tetrapods have evolved remarkably different structural solutions to common biophysical problems.

The rapid growth of digital imaging applications, including desktop publishing, multimedia, teleconferencing, and high-definition television (HDTV) has increased the need for effective and standardized image compression techniques. Among the emerging standards are JPEG, for compression of still images [Wallace 1991]; MPEG, for compression of motion video [Puri 1992]; and CCITT H. 261 (also known as Px 64), for compression of video telephony and teleconferencing. All three of these standards employ a basic technique known as the discrete cosine transform (DCT). Developed by Ahmed, Natarajan, and Rao [1974], the DCT is a close relative of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Its application to image compression was pioneered by Chen and Pratt [1984]. In this article, I will develop some simple functions to compute the DCT and show how it is used for image compression. We have used these functions in our laboratory to explore methods of optimizing image compression for the human viewer, using information about the human visual system [Watson 1993].

The mobile networks are supposed to contain typical base station with enhanced transmitted power and elevated antennas as well as simple mobile station. From EMC point of view, there are no direct indications against cell-size reduction. Local growth of system’s compatibility can be achieved by splitting of cells.

40|$|Optimal radar {{waveform}} {{design for}} target detection has been addressed in prior research literature under various assumptions regarding noise and clutter. A common {{model of the}} radar scene in work of this kind is a linear time-invariant (LTI) operator with additive Gaussian noise that acts on the transmitted signal to produce the received signal. This model is intrinsically ill-suited to dynamic scenes or moving radar platforms because it cannot account for Doppler. This paper introduces scene models based on Hilbert-Schmidt class (HS) operators on the space of finite-energy signals. This category of models generalizes the LTI category {{in the sense that}} every LTI operator is also a HS operator, but the HS class includes operators that account for frequency shifts as well as time shifts and are thus suitable for modeling radar scenes involving Doppler. Every HS operator is uniquely expressible as a superposition of <b>elementary</b> time and <b>frequency</b> shift operators, thus providing a convenient interpretation of a scene in terms of these physically meaningful operations on the transmitted signal.

Questions based on a review of literature and related research were developed by the researcher to be used in personal interviews with randomly selected teachers from the three districts. The questions, formed in a frequency format, were developed regarding the existence of selected factors. A total of 73 factors regarding influencers of instructional change, change agents who assist with instructional change, interventions of change agents, attitudes of the teacher, and conditions in the school were investigated.
