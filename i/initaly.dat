40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the association}} between art, cultural heritage and economic and financial logics, a coexistence that seems particularly difficult <b>inItaly.</b> Since ancient times, and with particular emphasis during the industrial revolution, the two worlds have had a conflicting relationship. Just in recent times the economic science and the academia have begun {{to get closer to}} art and culture, considered in their broadest sense. In the past, the quantitative and empirical bases distinguishing economic science were too far and aloof to allow the two realities to effectively cooperate, trusting each other. The key point under discussion here is the concepts of economic and financial sustainability; a major point for any initiative for a manager, a constraint and sometimes reason for unacceptable compromises for the artist. Thus, the research question to be posed is: are culture and economic science two worlds that can communicate...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} analyses {{conducted on}} a corpus of (audio) recorded and fullytranscribed doctor-patient interactions with native and non native patients, carriedon in a outward department of Obstetrics and Gynechology {{in a public}} hospital <b>inItaly.</b> The {{focus is on the}} doctors’ strategies employed to elicit information fromthe patients with particular regards to the patient’s job status and the likelihood thatshe continues to work during pregnancy. Applying CA principles to the analysis ofboth the sequential structure and the design of the question, the author highlightshow the activity of questioning about the patient’s job includes larger sequenceswith non native patients as compared to native patients, in which not only thepatient’s physical conditions but also her juridical status is questioned. The paperfinally discusses the implications of the analyses on the doctors’ training on onehand, and on the social representation of the migrant identity on the other...|$|E
40|$|An almost {{complete}} skull with associated periotics and one cervical vertebra from theEarly Miocene strata of the Chilcatay Formation (Pisco Basin, Peru) is described here andreferred to Notocetus vanbenedeni, a species previously recorded from Argentina, belong-ing to the extinct odontocete family Squalodelphinidae (Platanistoidea). The fossil wascollected {{in the same}} locality and approximately the same stratigraphical horizon as Huar-idelphis raimondii, suggesting the sympatric coexistence of two squalodelphinids during theEarly Miocene along the Pacific coast of South America. Considering the new record heredescribed, N. vanbenedeni lived both along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America,two marine areas in wide contact during the Late Oligocene and Early Miocene. Despitethe relative commonness of squalodelphinids in the Chilcatay Fm., the worldwide recordof this family remains globally rather scarce and significant specimens were only found <b>inItaly,</b> France, along the East Coast of USA, Argentina, Peru, and possibly New Zealand...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{similarity}} analysis {{between the}} large-mammal faunas of France and the Italian penin-sula for the Pliocene to Middle Pleistocene highlights the taxonomic and structural renewal of large-mammal assemblages {{that took place}} at the Early-Middle Pleistocene transition. This faunal renewal coincides with a period of climatic deterioration revealed by the spread ofgrasslands that supported more abundant 'cold ' taxa. Nevertheless, both in France and <b>inItaly,</b> this passage is not marked by a real turnover (i. e. the complete or a most complete renewal of a mammal fauna), but by an extinction phase followed by a ispersal event. The Plio-Pleistocene interval was characterized by several climatic changes that variably affected faunas at both global and local scales. Nonetheless, even where forced by global climatic and other envi-ronmental changes, the rate and extent of mammal dispersal can be greatly influenced by additional factors of which the extension of intracontinental and intercontinental barriers (mountain ranges, epi...|$|E
40|$|Geomorphosites and {{geological}} landscapes areamong {{the most}} important tourist attractions of rural andmountain areas. In the past decades, especially thanks toseveral research and cultural projects on geological heritage,many regional and local authorities have started inventoryingand publicising their landscapes and sites of geological andgeomorphological interest publishing booklets, geotouristicmaps and equipping their territories with explanatory panels. Nevertheless, geology and geomorphology are able to occupythe head titles of the major newspapers or make the breakingnews on TV channels only when natural hazards hit thepopulation. Making the processes that shape the morphologiesat the Earth’s surface understandable to a wider public andhelping people to “read” {{the wide variety of}} signs and remnantsof recent or remote natural disasters might help to retainsociety’s memory of these phenomena and therefore minimisehuman and material losses. The geomorphological scars in thelandscape that remind, if adequately interpreted, past naturaland or human-induced disasters are ideal spots for geoenvironmentaleducation and should therefore be the subjectof a scientific programme able to exploit their didactic value. This paper reports some interesting examples of such sites <b>inItaly...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background Asthma is {{the most}} common chronic disease in childhood; <b>inItaly</b> its {{prevalence}} is estimated to be 9 % in children (0 - 14 years old). Objective Estimate the use of anti-asthmatics prescriptions in the paediatric population and to evaluate its association with children’s and physician’s characteristics. Methods The study was conducted in 728, 830 children 1 - 14 years old residing in the Lazio region,Central Italy. Individual data on AA (ATC R 03) prescriptions during 2009 were used. Prevalence was calculated according to children’s gender, age and area of residence. The association, in terms of rate ratio (RR), between AA prescription with children’s and physicians’ characteristics was estimated by multi level Poisson models. Results Overall, 404, 239 AA prescriptions were given to 178, 850 (25 %) children with the highest frequency in the 1 - 2 age group (39 %). Boys were more likely to receive a prescription than girls. Beclomethasone was the most prescribed active ingredient (34 %), followed by salbutamol (24 %); 44 % of children ³ 6 years old had only 1 box prescription in the year, 48. 9 % of these subjects were treated with inhaled corticosteroids alone. Children’s gender, age and area of residence were the major determinants in drug prescription while, as far as physicians’ level,  gender and number of patients in charge were associated to a greater probability of getting an AA prescription. Conclusion Prescription data provide useful information to measure prevalence use and consumption of AA drugs. Variability between age groups as well as differences in doctors’ characteristics suggests that specific strategies to optimise resource use of AA are needed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Maize {{residues}} on {{the soil}} surface are a major inoculum source of several fungal pathogens of maize. Because the moisture content of crop residues can greatly affect fungal survival and inoculum production,we studied the effects of rainfall and relative humidity (RH) on the moisture content in maize stalkresidues on bare soil and on soil under a wheat crop at the heading stage (i. e., when the canopy providesthe maximum soil cover). The moisture content of residues that were initially saturated and that werethen placed on soil outdoors declined to a minimum value after approximately 32 h. On each of thefollowing days {{and in the absence}} of rain, the moisture content showed a diurnal pattern with decreasingvalues between 08. 00 and 18. 00 h and increasing values between 18. 00 and 08. 00 h. The pattern wasthe opposite for vapor pressure deficit. A simple model was developed to predict the wetting–dryingdynamics of maize stalk residues based on environmental conditions. The model has three compartments:(i) wetting of maize stalk residues during rain; (ii) drying after rain; and (iii) diurnal fluctuations in theabsence of rain. The model was calibrated and then validated against independent data collected <b>inItaly</b> and France. Comparison of observed vs. predicted data showed no systematic deviations of modelpredictions from real observations, with R 2 = 0. 84 and standard error of estimates = 8. 7 %. The correlationconcordance coefficient (= 0. 89) and model efficiency (= 0. 75) showed a satisfactory goodness-of-fit to thereal data, with a slight overestimation (coefficient of residual mass = 0. 11). The model should be a usefulcomponent of models for those plant pathogens, including Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium verticillioides andGibberella zeae, that produce inoculum in maize residues...|$|E
