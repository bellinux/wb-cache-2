The experimental design was completely randomized, in a factorial scheme, using four soils, five P rates (75, 150, 300, 500 and 800 mg dm- 3) and two liming treatments (with and without liming), with three replicates. After 60 days of flooding, soil samples were submitted to P extraction by Mehlich 1 and resin, and phosphorous fractionation. Two rice plants were cultivated in pots containing 3 dm³ of waterlogged soils. The labile P and the moderately labile P of the soils contributed for rice nutrition. The two tested extractors presented efficiency in the evaluation of P availability for the rice cultivated in lowland waterlogged soils...|$|R
40|$|Advance Microwave Scanning Radiometer – Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) derived Vegetation Water Content (VWC) at predawn (01 : 30 LST, {{descending}} pass) {{and afternoon}} (13 : 30 LST; ascending pass) {{were used to}} assess crop water stress condition over the selected meteorological subdivisions of India. The temporal profile of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to study the progression of crop growth. The Diurnal Difference Vegetation Water Content (ddVWC) was found to be sensitive to rainfall patterns (wet/dry spell) particularly in moderate to full crop cover condition (NDVI> 0. 4). The ddVWC was found to be significantly (p = 0. 05) correlated with the rainfall over the rainfed regions. The ddVWC was further characterized to represent different categories of crop water stress considering irrigated <b>flooded</b> <b>rice</b> <b>crop</b> as a benchmark. Inter year comparative analysis of temporal variations of the ddVWC revealed its capability to differentiate normal (2005) and sub-normal years (2008 and 2009) in term of intensity and persistence of crop water stress. Spatio-temporal patterns of ddVWC could capture regional progression of crop water stress at high temporal resolution in near real time...|$|R
40|$|The {{constraints}} {{in current}} vegetable production {{systems in the}} Red River Delta, Vietnam, in which vegetables are rotated with <b>flooded</b> <b>rice,</b> called {{for the design of}} alternative systems of permanent vegetable production. The practical model, PermVeg, was developed to generate vegetable crop sequences for permanent vegetable production, as based on a set of rules and restrictions. Permanent vegetable production systems were designed based on the following five scenarios: (i) increased profit, (ii) reduced labour requirement, (iii) decreased costs of pesticide use, (iv) improved crop biodiversity and (v) selected crops with low-perishable products. PermVeg showed that theoretically all selected crop sequences in the different alternative systems increased farmers’ income compared to the traditional system. The system with the highest profitability increased profit per hectare per day by a factor of three as compared to the traditional system. Labour requirement in days per hectare per day in a crop sequence also increased in all systems. Except for the system with low costs of pesticide use, permanent vegetable production systems had higher pesticide costs than the traditional, vegetable – <b>flooded</b> <b>rice</b> <b>crop</b> sequence. Given the model outcomes, permanent vegetable production systems can be an option to improve farmers’ income, to provide labour opportunities, and, {{in the case of the}} high crop biodiversity system, to contribute to the development of sustainable production systems. The PermVeg model can act as a practical tool to rapidly explore crop sequence options and to help farmers’ decision-making...|$|R
40|$|Flooding induces {{significant}} chemical {{changes in}} soil {{due to the}} weakness of gas transfer between soil and atmosphere. Thus, pCO 2 increases in solution while pO 2 and redox potential decrease. In an alkaline soil, {{this can lead to}} great variations of alkalinity. Increase in pCO 2 leads to a decrease in pH, a dissolution of alkaline minerals, like calcite, and an increase in alkalinity. Decrease in potential redox is related to reduction of Fe(III) that produce alkalinity in soil solution. This reduction of Fe is supposed to take place both : in the structure of ferriferous clay minerals that induces an increase in the Cationic Exchange Capacity; and in a crystalline structure, natural Fe (II) -Fe(III) green rusts that induces a decrease in Anionic Exchange Capacity. The influence of these processes has been evaluated through laboratory and field experiments under <b>flooded</b> <b>rice</b> <b>cropping</b> system in the Office du Niger perimeters in Mali. The results allow to model the alkalinity balance in such alkaline soils : alkalinity is produced in soil solution, diffuses to the flood water and finally is flushed toward the drainage system. These mechanisms are able to ensure the sustainability of irrigated schemes faced with alkalinisation hazard...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{associated with}} improvement of soil nutritional status by oilseed rape crop, leading to better performance of <b>rice</b> <b>crop,</b> in rice-oilseed rape cropping systems is little known. The {{present study was}} aimed {{to test the hypothesis}} that earthworm casts produced during oilseed rape-growing season have positive effects on grain yield and fertilizer nitrogen (N) utilization in the subsequent <b>flooded</b> <b>rice</b> <b>crop.</b> A 15 N-tracing pot experiment was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} earthworm casts collected from oilseed rape fields on yield attributes in rice and the fate of fertilizer N. Soil treated with earthworm casts (soil: earthworm casts = 4 : 1, w/w) (EC 1) produced 39 % higher grain yield than soil only (EC 0). EC 1 had 18 % more panicle number and 10 % higher spikelet filling percentage than EC 0. Aboveground biomass and harvest index were higher in EC 1 than in EC 0 by 20 % and 15 %, respectively. SPAD values in flag leaves were 10 % and 22 % higher under EC 1 than EC 0 at 15 and 20 days after heading, respectively. EC 1 had 19 % higher total N uptake and 18 % higher physiological N-use efficiency than EC 0. These positive effects of earthworm casts on yield attributes offset negative effects of decreasing N rate from 0. 74 g pot- 1 (equivalent to the recommended field rate of 150 kg ha- 1) to 0. 44 g pot- 1 (equivalent to 60 % of the recommended rate). Fertilizer N retention rate was 7 % higher while fertilizer N loss rate was 6 % lower in EC 1 than in EC 0. Our study suggests that earthworm casts produced during oilseed rape-growing season are expected to have the following benefits on the subsequent <b>flooded</b> <b>rice</b> system: (1) improving growth and physiological processes in rice plants and consequently increasing rice grain yield, and (2) increasing fertilizer N retention rate and hence decreasing fertilizer N loss rate and reducing environmental risk...|$|R

40|$|Livestock waste composts {{with minimum}} {{inorganic}} fertilizer as a soil amendment in low-input intensive farming are a feasible agricultural practice to improve soil fertility and productivity and to mitigate soil degradation. The key {{benefits of the}} practice rely on the activities of soil microorganisms. However, the role of different livestock composts [composted cattle manure (CCM) vs. composted swine manure (CSM) ] on soil microbes, their activities and the overall impact on soil fertility and productivity in a flooded paddy remains elusive. This study compares the effectiveness of CCM and CSM amendment on bacterial communities, activities, nutrient availability, and crop yield in a <b>flooded</b> <b>rice</b> <b>cropping</b> system. We used deep 16 S amplicon sequencing and soil enzyme activities to decipher bacterial communities and activities, respectively. Both CCM and CSM amendment significantly increased soil pH, nutrient availability (C, N, and P), microbial biomass, soil enzyme activities indicative for C and N cycles, aboveground plant biomass and grain yield. And the increase in above-mentioned parameters was more prominent in the CCM treatment compared to the CSM treatment. The CCM amendment increased species richness and stimulated copiotrophic microbial groups (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Firmicutes) which are often involved in degradation of complex organic compounds. Moreover, some dominant species (e. g., Azospirillum zeae, Azospirillum halopraeferens, Azospirillum rugosum, Clostridium alkalicellulosi, Clostridium caenicola, Clostridium termitidis, Clostridium cellulolyticum, Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum, Pleomorphomonas oryzae, Variovorax boronicumulans, Pseudomonas xanthomarina, Pseudomonas stutzeri, and Bacillus niacini) which have key roles in plant growth promotion and/or lignocellulose degradation were enhanced under CCM treatment compared to CSM treatment. Multivariate analysis revealed that soil pH and available carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) were the major, while total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and available phosphorus (P) were the minor drivers of variation in bacterial communities. Overall, our observations suggest that CCM amendment is better than CSM amendment to improve soil fertility and crop yield in a submerged <b>rice</b> <b>cropping</b> system...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} transplanted and <b>flooded</b> <b>rice</b> <b>cropping</b> {{system is}} threatened by water shortage and labor cost increase in many Asian countries and is currently evolving toward direct-seeded and water-saving systems. However, yield penalties generally accompany this evolution and ongoing research targets their mitigation. In a previous research, slower plant development rate was observed in aerobic crops, possibly caused by the increased plant density. This possible factor was tested in experiments conducted at IRRI's farm, Los Baños, Philippines, in 2012 and 2013. One elite variety was direct-seeded at three plant distances (6, 10, and 20 cm × 20 cm) and sprinkler-irrigated to keep the soil water potential above − 10 kPa. Weekly measurements were made to dissect crop and plant physiological differences. Data from previous experiments on tillering in the greenhouse of four varieties and in fields in aerobic and flooded conditions were added to strengthen {{the results from the}} current experiment. The last upper leaves of the main stem appeared faster at higher plant density, thus increase plant density was not the cause for the slower leaf appearance in aerobic than in flooded crops. Plants at higher plant density also had earlier panicle initiation, earlier earing, and 0. 8 leaf less than plants at low density. The number of outgrowing tillers was linked to the number of leaves on the main stem by a variety-specific relationship that is independent from plant density and water management. Tiller density was regulated by the cessation of the outgrowth of tillers triggered by the onset of stem elongation at 20 -cm plant distance and occurred earlier at shorter distances probably in response to the high root density. Grain yields were significantly higher at higher plant density (6 -cm and 10 -cm plant distances) and correlated with a higher tiller density. Thus for aerobic crops, seedling density higher than 50 plants m− 2 remains the way to get high yields for the type of variety used in this study. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

Replacement of rice with less water requiring crops such as maize in the RWS and identification of effective strategies for alternate tillage systems will promote sustainable cropping systems in the IGP. To this effect a 3 -year field experiment was established with annual maize–wheat rotation in the north-western IGP of India to evaluate the effect of 3 tillage systems (conventional flat, CTF; no-till flat, NTF; permanent raised beds, NTB) on crop production, water use efficiency, economic profitability and soil physical quality. Grain yield of maize was highest (8. 2 – 73. 4 %) under NTB followed by NTF and CTF across the years. Wheat yield was significantly higher under NTF during the 1 st year while tillage practices had non-significant effect in the succeeding two years. On average, maize planted on NTB recorded about 11 % lower water use and 16 % higher water use efficiency compared to CT. The NTB and NTF required 24. 7 % and 10. 8 % less irrigation water than CTF system, respectively with 11. 5 % higher system productivity and demonstrated higher water productivity. The NTB and NTF systems provided similar net returns (averaged over 3 years) in maize–wheat system (MWS), which were US$ 281 ha− 1 higher compared to CTF system. The CTF system had higher bulk density and penetration resistance in 10 – 15 and 15 – 20 cm soil layers due to compaction caused by the repeated tillage. The steady-state infiltration rate and soil aggregation (> 0. 25 mm) were higher under NTB and NTF and lower in the CTF system. Similarly, mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates was higher under NTF and NTB compared to CTF. The study reveals that NTB and NTF systems could be more viable options for MWS in order to save input costs and enhance profitability; however, the long-term effects of these alternative technologies need to be studied under varying agro-ecologies...|$|R

2500|$|Bengal's {{economy was}} {{predominantly}} agrarian. For {{at least a}} decade before the crisis, between half and three quarters of those dependent on agriculture were already at near subsistence level. Underlying causes of the famine included inefficient agricultural practices, dense population, and de-peasantisation through debt bondage and land grabbing. Proximate causes comprise localised natural disasters (a cyclone, storm surges and <b>flooding,</b> and <b>rice</b> <b>crop</b> disease) and at least five consequences of war: initial, general war-time inflation of both demand-pull and monetary origin; loss of rice imports due to the Japanese occupation of Burma (modern Myanmar); near-total disruption of Bengal's market supplies and transport systems by the preemptive, defensive scorched earth tactics of the Raj (the [...] "" [...] for rice and boats); and later, massive inflation brought on by repeated policy failures, war profiteering, speculation, and perhaps hoarding. Finally, the government prioritised military and defense needs over those of the rural poor, allocating medical care and food immensely in the favour of the military, labourers in military industries, and civil servants. All of these factors were further compounded by restricted access to grain: domestic sources were constrained by emergency inter-provincial trade barriers, while access to international sources was largely denied by the War Cabinet of Great Britain. The relative impact of each of these contributing factors to the death toll and economic devastation is still a matter of controversy. Different analyses frame the famine against natural, economic, or political causes.|$|R

40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{and annual}} variability of sensible heat flux (H), latent heat flux (LE), evapotranspiration (ET), crop coefficient (Kc) and crop water productivity (WPET) were investigated under two different <b>rice</b> environments, <b>flooded</b> and aerobic soil conditions, using the eddy covariance (EC) technique during 2008 – 2009 cropping periods. Since {{we had only}} one EC system for monitoring two rice environments, we had to move the system from one location to the other every week. In total, we had to gap-fill an average of 50 – 60 % of the missing weekly data {{as well as those}} values rejected by the quality control tests in each rice field in all four cropping seasons. Although the EC method provides a direct measurement of LE, which is the energy used for ET, we needed to correct the values of H and LE to close the energy balance using the Bowen ratio closure method before we used LE to estimate ET. On average, the energy balance closure before correction was 0. 72 ± 0. 06 and it increased to 0. 99 ± 0. 01 after correction. The G in both flooded and aerobic fields was very low. Likewise, the energy involved in miscellaneous processes such as photosynthesis, respiration and heat storage in the rice canopy was not taken into consideration. Average for four <b>cropping</b> seasons, <b>flooded</b> <b>rice</b> fields had 19 % more LE than aerobic fields whereas aerobic rice fields had 45 % more H than flooded fields. This resulted in a lower Bowen ratio in flooded fields (0. 14 ± 0. 03) than in aerobic fields (0. 24 ± 0. 01). For our study sites, evapotranspiration was primarily controlled by net radiation. The aerobic rice fields had lower growing season ET rates (3. 81 ± 0. 21 mm d− 1) than the <b>flooded</b> <b>rice</b> fields (4. 29 ± 0. 23 mm d− 1), most probably due to the absence of ponded water and lower leaf area index of aerobic <b>rice.</b> Likewise, the <b>crop</b> coefficient, Kc, of aerobic rice was significantly lower than that of <b>flooded</b> <b>rice.</b> For aerobic rice, Kc values were 0. 95 ± 0. 01 for the vegetative stage, 1. 00 ± 0. 01 for the reproductive stage, 0. 97 ± 0. 04 for the ripening stage and 0. 88 ± 0. 03 for the fallow period, whereas, for <b>flooded</b> <b>rice,</b> Kc values were 1. 04 ± 0. 04 for the vegetative stage, 1. 11 ± 0. 05 for the reproductive stage, 1. 04 ± 0. 05 for the ripening stage and 0. 93 ± 0. 06 for the fallow period. The average annual ET was 1301 mm for aerobic rice and 1440 mm for <b>flooded</b> <b>rice.</b> This corresponds to about 11 % lower total evapotranspiration in aerobic fields than in flooded fields. However, the crop water productivity (WPET) of aerobic rice (0. 42 ± 0. 03 g grain kg− 1 water) was significantly lower than that of <b>flooded</b> <b>rice</b> (1. 26 ± 0. 26 g grain kg− 1 water) because the grain yields of aerobic rice were very low since they were subjected to water stress. The results of this investigation showed significant differences in energy balance and evapotranspiration between <b>flooded</b> and aerobic <b>rice</b> ecosystems. Aerobic rice is one of the promising water-saving technologies being developed to lower the water requirements of the <b>rice</b> <b>crop</b> to address the issues of water scarcity. This information should be taken into consideration in evaluating alternative water-saving technologies for environmentally sustainable rice production systems...|$|R
30|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between the agricultural GDP of Pakistan and the <b>rice</b> <b>crop</b> output area under <b>rice</b> <b>crop</b> production, and water availability during 1970 – 2015. Time series data were collected from the National Food Security and Research, various issues of the Economic Survey of Pakistan, and the Pakistan Statistical Year Book. For analysis the ADF unit root test, Johansen cointegration test, and OLS were used. The results of the Johansen cointegration test revealed that a long-term relationship between <b>rice</b> <b>crop</b> output, area under <b>rice</b> <b>crop</b> production, and water availability with the agricultural GDP of Pakistan. The results of regression analysis showed that rice output and area under <b>rice</b> <b>crop</b> production have a positive and significant relationship with the agricultural GDP, while water availably has a negative relationship. Therefore, this study suggests and recommends that the government of Pakistan seeks out new policies and funding schemes for the development and improvement of water availability.|$|R

40|$|<b>Rice</b> <b>crop</b> {{height is}} an {{important}} agronomic trait linked to plant type and yield potential. This research developed an automatic image processing technique to detect <b>rice</b> <b>crop</b> height based on images taken by a digital camera attached to a field server. The camera acquires rice paddy images daily at a consistent time of day. The images include the rice plants and a marker bar used to provide a height reference. The <b>rice</b> <b>crop</b> height can be indirectly measured from the images by measuring {{the height of the}} marker bar compared to the height of the initial marker bar. Four digital image processing steps are employed to automatically measure the <b>rice</b> <b>crop</b> height: band selection, filtering, thresholding, and height measurement. Band selection is used to remove redundant features. Filtering extracts significant features of the marker bar. The thresholding method is applied to separate objects and boundaries of the marker bar versus other areas. The marker bar is detected and compared with the initial marker bar to measure the <b>rice</b> <b>crop</b> height. Our experiment used a field server with a digital camera to continuously monitor a rice field located in Suphanburi Province, Thailand. The experimental results show that the proposed method measures <b>rice</b> <b>crop</b> height effectively, with no human intervention required...|$|R
40|$|Rice {{is one of}} {{the major}} crops {{cultivated}} predominantly in flooded paddies, thus a large amount of water is consumed during its growing season. Accurate paddy rice maps are therefore important inputs for improved estimates of actual evapotranspiration in the agricultural landscape. The main objective of this study was to obtain <b>flooded</b> paddy <b>rice</b> maps using multi-temporal images of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in the Krishna River Basin, India. First, ground-based spectral samples collected by a field spectroradiometer, CROPSCAN, were used to demonstrate unique contrasts between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) observed during the transplanting season of rice. The contrast between Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) from MODIS time series data was then used to generate classification decision rules to map <b>flooded</b> <b>rice</b> paddies, for the transplanting seasons of Kharif and Rabi <b>rice</b> <b>crops</b> in the Krishna River Basin. Consistent with ground spectral observations, the relationship of the MODIS EVI vs. LSWI of paddy rice fields showed distinct features from other crops during the transplanting seasons. The MODIS-derived maps were validated against extensive reference data collected from multiple land use field surveys. The accuracy of the paddy rice maps, when determined using field plot data, was approximately 78 %. The MODIS-derived <b>rice</b> <b>crop</b> areas were also compared with the areas reported by Department of Agriculture (DOA), Government of India (Government Statistics). The estimated root mean square difference (RMSD) of rice area estimated using MODIS and those reported by the Department of Agriculture over 10 districts varied between 3. 4 % and 6. 6 % during 10 years of our study period. Some of the major factors responsible for this difference include high noise of the MODIS images during the prolonged monsoon seasons (typically June–October) and the coarse spatial resolution (500 m) of the MODIS images compared to the small crop fields in the basin. However, this study demonstrates, based on multi-year analysis, that MODIS images can still provide robust and consistent <b>flooded</b> paddy <b>rice</b> extent and areas over a highly heterogeneous large river basin...|$|R
