His old friend Eric Hayden (Gaston) has been waiting for a year for confirmation from the Republican-led Congress, and is offered the position of dean of Georgetown's law school. But Josh suggests making a temporary recess appointment that will at least put the issue on the agenda and Hayden agrees.

2500|$|The {{motives of}} the {{kidnapping}} are officially unknown, {{but there are}} several lines of investigation that suggest {{a number of reasons}} behind the mass abduction.
