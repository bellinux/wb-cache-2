50|$|The {{electrical}} and thermal conductivities of metals originate {{from the fact}} that their outer electrons are delocalized. This situation can be visualized by seeing the atomic structure of a metal as a collection of atoms embedded in a sea of highly mobile electrons. The electrical conductivity, as well as the electrons' contribution to the heat capacity and heat conductivity of metals can be calculated from the free electron model, which {{does not take into account}} the detailed structure of the <b>ion</b> <b>lattice.</b>|$|E

50|$|Although Cooper pairing is {{a quantum}} effect, {{the reason for}} the pairing can be seen from a {{simplified}} classical explanation. An electron in a metal normally behaves as a free particle. The electron is repelled from other electrons due to their negative charge, but it also attracts the positive ions that make up the rigid lattice of the metal. This attraction distorts the <b>ion</b> <b>lattice,</b> moving the ions slightly toward the electron, increasing the positive charge density of the lattice in the vicinity. This positive charge can attract other electrons. At long distances, this attraction between electrons due to the displaced ions can overcome the electrons' repulsion due to their negative charge, and cause them to pair up. The rigorous quantum mechanical explanation shows that the effect is due to electron-phonon interactions, with the phonon being the collective motion of the positively-charged lattice.|$|E

5000|$|There {{is a way}} of {{affecting}} {{this free}} motion of electrons, which is by use of an electric field. This process is known as electrical conduction. An electric field provides a potential difference along a wire of electrons, which creates a force, , where [...] is the charge of an electron and [...] is the magnitude of the electric field. That force accelerates the electrons, as expected by Newton’s second law. The electrons are given a velocity away from the (negative source of the) field, which leads to these collisions with the fixed ions. The collisions rid the electrons of their kinetic energy momentarily, transferring that energy to the <b>ion</b> <b>lattice</b> in the form of heat, until the field again provides this sort of [...] "push" [...] to the electrons. The net result of all of this pushing and stopping (or gaining of kinetic energy and then a release of it), is a small value called drift velocity. To better understand this concept, one could picture a busload of kids (electrons), who are energetically moving about on the bus (wire). The kids have instantaneous velocities, but after colliding with each other and bouncing back to their seats the average velocity of the kids is zero. However, as the bus moves forward, the kids have a small drift velocity {{in the direction of the}} motion of the bus. The drift that is opposite of the electric field is in fact an electric current.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that to {{calculate}} the parameters of the electrostatic field of the ion crystal lattice it sufficient to take into account ions located at a distance of 1 - 2 lattice spacings. More distant ions make insignificant contribution. As a result, the electrostatic energy of the <b>ion</b> <b>lattice</b> in the alkaline halide crystal produced by both positive and negative ions is in good agreement with experiment when the melting temperature and the shear modulus are calculated. For fcc and bcc metals the <b>ion</b> <b>lattice</b> electrostatic energy is not sufficient to obtain the observed values of these parameters. It is possible to resolve the contradiction if one assumes that the electron density is strongly localized and has a crystal structure described by the lattice delta - function. As a result, positive charges alternate with negative ones as in the alkaline halide crystal. Such delta-like localization of the electron density is known as a model of nearly free electrons.

Constructivists trace these misconceptions back' {{to the unique}} conceptual frames of reference of students.

The strategies are based on guidelines postulated by researchers such as Posner and his co-workers (1982 : 211). Several strategies use media to motivate students or provide a more concrete base for concept formation. The side effects of the utilization of media are important to designers and users of media. An empirical investigation was launched to determine whether media could also stimulate the formation of misconceptions.
