5|$|I went to Iraq {{because what}} I saw when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> there was soldiers—young kids {{for the most}} part—helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get {{hospitals}} open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these {{young men and women}} who are over there fighting to help this country.|$|E
5|$|The 1919 {{season began}} with high expectations; World War <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> and key players had {{returned}} from service. However, things did not go Warner's way; {{at the beginning of}} the season, problems with the offensive line and on the flanks became apparent. Their first defeat was at Syracuse, where the Orangemen won 20–3. The 1919 Panthers had six wins, two losses and one tie.|$|E
25|$|In Kaifeng, at the Canadian Church Mission, Phillips was {{considered}} a senior missionary due to her prior experience and ability to speak Chinese. The Bishop {{in charge of the}} mission placed Phillips in command of the women's work, the supervision of the boys' orphanage, and the construction of the new hospital. St. Paul's Hospital opened in November 1914. Not long after the opening, the mission began to deteriorate; two missionaries had already resigned. At this time, the mission was ordered to close the hospital until World War <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>over.</b> After closing down the hospital, Phillips did not wish to join any more missions, for her initial view of missionary work had been ruined.|$|E

25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get {{guns for}} the Contras', {{that sort of}} stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E

On the possibility of a sequel, Lundgren said: [...] "I didn't consider [...] as a franchise, but when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> there , I started thinking, 'How would I do this different? How would I stay close to the subject matter?' Organ trafficking is quite big as well, so I thought that could be interesting. We could follow up with some kind of other trade." ...|$|E

500|$|At times Kiedis {{has also}} resented singing the song, {{especially}} during instances {{when he felt}} distanced from the song's lyrics. In the past few years, however, Kiedis has experienced a revival in interest: [...] "Although {{there have been times}} when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> , I've rediscovered it and now I feel close to it and it still has power, and life, and purpose as a song." [...] Frusciante believed that the flexibility of [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] has contributed to its success: [...] "A lot of the time that is one of the ingredients of a hit; you can hear it over and over and it will still always mean new things, but you do go through cycles." [...] Flea believes that the reason [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] had a recent revival in relevancy was due to Frusciante's return to the band from 1998 to 2009 after quitting in 1992. Flea believed that it was vital to have the four members who wrote the track together.|$|E
500|$|In 1919, Gandhi then aged 49, {{after the}} World War <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> sought {{political}} co-operation from Muslims in his fight against British imperialism by supporting the Ottoman Empire {{that had been}} defeated in the World War. Before this initiative of Gandhi, communal disputes and religious riots between Hindus and Muslims were common in British India, such as the riots of 1917–18. Gandhi had already supported the British crown with resources and by recruiting Indian soldiers {{to fight the war}} in Europe on the British side. This effort of Gandhi was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with swaraj (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I. The British government, instead of self government, had offered minor reforms instead, disappointing Gandhi. Gandhi announced his satyagraha (civil disobedience) intentions. The British colonial officials made their counter move by passing the Rowlatt Act, to block Gandhi's movement. The Act allowed the British government to treat civil disobedience participants as criminals and gave it the legal basis to arrest anyone for [...] "preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without judicial review or any need for a trial".|$|E

She came by the studio and let me hear her album, which was crazy, and we just went through a couple tracks to see which one I fit on." [...] He continued, [...] "Then she played 'FU' and I fell in love with it. We just went in there and did it together." [...] Regarding the theme of the song, he explained, [...] "It's two letters 'F' and 'U.' You've just got two letters for somebody when you get to that point, when somebody breaks your heart and you're in a relationship which has gone sour. So now you've only got two letters for them, 'F' and 'U'." [...] Its lyrics dismiss a cheating ex, as mentioned in the lines [...] "I don't really have much to say/ <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> it the second that I saw her name/ I got two letters for you/ One of them is F/ And the other one is U/ 'Cause what you gotta do/ is go get yourself a clue." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 2009, Coulter {{released}} [...] "Don't Miss You", which {{peaked at}} number24, {{as the lead}} single from her proposed third studio album, Hear No, See No, Speak No. The second single, the title track, was released in October 2009, and peaked at number46. Hear No, See No, Speak No was originally scheduled {{to be released in}} November 2009, but was pushed back for a January 2010 release. Coulter eventually decided to cancel the album's release due to the first two singles struggling on the charts. In March2010, Coulter was a supporting act for Backstreet Boys' Australian leg of their This Is Us Tour. That same year, her song [...] "Can't Touch It" [...] was featured on the soundtrack to the film, Sex and the City 2. Coulter announced via her official Twitter account on 2 July 2010, that she had parted ways with her manager of five years Lauren Brown. It was then revealed that her new manager was Sean Anderson of the management company 22. Coulter later parted ways with Anderson and became managed by her-then boyfriend Richard Harrison of Black Label Entertainment. Throughout 2010, Coulter put her music career on hold as she took on a full-time position as a breakfast radio presenter for Sydney's Nova 96.9, alongside Merrick Watts and Scott Dooley. During this time, Coulter had thoughts about quitting music. [...] "At the start of [...] year, I couldn't imagine walking in a studio and writing a song again. I didn't even want to get on stage and sing. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> it. It's hard for me to say that even now. Music is all I've ever wanted to do. I wasn't mentally there any more. I wanted out, it was too hard. I felt like I'd been worn down. I felt defeated". She later stated that after attending a Thirty Seconds to Mars concert in Melbourne and rewatching Michael Jackson's [...] DVD, she was inspired to perform again.|$|E

2500|$|Frank Tyson met {{his wife}} Ursula Miels (born in 1936) in Melbourne on the 1954–55 tour, and they married in a Melbourne church on 22 November 1957 with much publicity. They had three children, Philip (a non-Typhoon medium paced bowler), Sara and Anna, and eight grandchildren. He retired from first class cricket in 1960 and emigrated to Australia as a ten pound pom, as his hero Harold Larwood had done ten years earlier. [...] "It had struck me while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> there {{that it was a}} {{wonderful}} country to bring up a family, with the open spaces, the climate and the job opportunities". He became a schoolmaster at Carey Baptist Grammar School in Melbourne, teaching English, French and History, later becoming a housemaster and the head of languages.|$|E
2500|$|While {{he was in}} prison, he {{organised}} some of {{his comrades}} {{to meet with the}} German government in Thailand. They donated a large amount of money and promised more if a spectacular action could be done in Vietnam against the French. The comrades attempted an action but failed completely, wasting all the money. After his release, Phan travelled to Beijing and to Japan, and then to various parts of China trying to get back into Vietnam. When he eventually got to the border of Yunnan Province and Vietnam, he discovered that World War <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> and his plans of using it to help defeat the French were hopeless. Phan wandered around China for years after this without accomplishing anything significant. He pondered collaborating with the French, who were now ruled by the Socialist Party (France), and he wrote a booklet about why collaboration with the French would be good. He later changed his mind and blamed this thinking on Phan Ba Ngoc, who was assassinated by one of Phan's supporters for being a collaborator with the French.|$|E
2500|$|Inman {{played the}} camp Mr. Wilberforce Claybourne Humphries and his earlier {{career in the}} clothes retail {{business}} was good preparation for this role in a menswear department. Inman developed a characteristic limp-wristed mincing walk, and a high-pitched catchphrase, [...] "I'm free!", which soon entered popular culture. Inman reported that four or {{five members of the}} group Campaign for Homosexual Equality picketed one of his shows in protest as they believed his persona did not help their cause. Inman said that [...] "they thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> exaggerating the gay character. But I don't think I do. In fact there are people far more camp than Mr. Humphries walking around this country. Anyway, I {{know for a fact that}} an enormous number of viewers like Mr. Humphries and don't really care whether he's camp or not. So far from doing harm to the homosexual image, I feel I might be doing some good". Both Inman and David Croft stated that the character was [...] "just a mother's boy", and that his sexual orientation was never explicitly stated. Inman continued to play in live shows after his success as Mr. Humphries, and began to incorporate camp mannerisms to those performances too, once saying [...] "Even when I'm not playing Mr Humphries, say at a summer season, I camp it up a bit. If I don't the audience are disappointed".|$|E

2500|$|Speaking to The Sun {{newspaper}} in June 2008, Swash {{has talked about}} his dissatisfaction with the direction the producers had taken Mickey. In Swash's opinion, Mickey had only been used for [...] "light relief" [...] since September 2005, when Swash was forced to take a three-month break from the serial after he contracted meningoencephalitis — a rare form of viral meningitis, which makes the brain swell up. EastEnders writers were reported to be [...] "frantically reworking scripts" [...] to explain Mickey's sudden disappearance, and according to Swash, this meant that a big storyline concentrating {{on the relationship between}} Mickey and his estranged father Mike had to be cut. He has commented, [...] "My illness had a massive impact on my job. When I came back I couldn’t find my feet. New producers came in and brought in new actors and I got lost down the pecking order [...] Ever since I came back, I’ve had nothing regular. As an actor you want storylines to stretch yourself. To be fair, I didn't work as much when the Miller family arrived in 2004. When it was just Mickey, I got really good stuff. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> the moon about the family but producers needed to concentrate on developing their characters and I had to take a back seat [...] Mickey just became light relief – the joker. That’s all right but I’ve got more ambition.
