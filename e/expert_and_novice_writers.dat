40|$|Based on {{the premise}} that {{planning}} in writing is a strategic response to both the writing situation and the writer's own knowledge, this paper describes the process adult writers bring to ill-defined, expository tasks, such as writing essays, articles, reports and proposals.

Research in both instructional and academic writing which st;gests that writers may fail to turn to a constructive strategy even when ill-defined tasks demand it is examined in the paper.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical study based on action research in which <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> facilitators in facilitated modelling workshops are compared.

40|$|This {{research}} project focused upon the design strategies adopted by <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> designers. It {{was based upon}} a desire to compare the design problem solving strategies of novices, in this case key stage three pupils studying technolgy within the United Kingdom National Curriculum, with designers who could be considered to have developed expertise. The findings helped to provide insights into potential teaching strategies to suit novice designers. Verbal protocols were made as samples of <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> designers solved a design problem and talked aloud as they worked. The verbalisations were recorded on video tape. The protocols were transcribed and segmented, with each segment being assigned to a predetermined coding system which represented a model of design problem solving. The results of the encoding were analysed and consideration was also given to the general design strategy and heuristics used by the <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> designers. The drawings and models produced during the generation of the protocols were also analysed and considered. A number of {{significant differences between the}} problem solving strategies adopted by the <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> designers were identified.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} is to portray a composite picture of the native and non-native expert and novice writers' composing and revising processes as they wrote an argumentative essay in English. Analyses of the experienced and novice writers' revision processes served to answer four main questions posed {{at the beginning of}} the experimental study: 1. When did revisions occur during the composing process? 2. Were there any similarities and differences in the categories of revision the subjects employed? 3. Were there any similarities and differences in the techniques the subjects employed? and 4. Were there any similarities and differences in the purposes of the subjects' revisions? These questions were also posed to compare the native and nonnative expert writers and the native and non-native novice writers. The results indicate that the native and non-native experienced and novice writers in this study made changes in the first and second writing sessions, in the four writing cycles, and in the combinations pre-draft/first draft and between draft/final draft, although they revised to different extends. Both writer groups coincided in their preference for the word level over the surface, phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph and global levels. The experienced subjects, however, revised at the higher discourse levels more often than the novice writers did. No important differences were concluded between both writer types in the techniques used for revising. Per purposes of revision, both the <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> <b>writers</b> revised with an informational purpose in mind, although they differed in their preference for the rest of purposes of revision: while the expert writers made higher proportions of meaning revisions, the novice showed a tendency for formal changes. Further comparisons indicate there were also similarities between both types of writers: the unskilled writers in this study were also aware of the need for making content revisions. Indeed, they made some attempts at improving meaning through sentence, paragraph and global revisions, although they failed to achieve success. The native and non-native experienced subjects coincided in their preference for the word level across drafts and writing sessions. The rest of the levels occurred in descending order as the discourse level ascended from the word to the global level. Global changes were often avoided as they needed more cognitive effort. They also showed interest for the surface level, although they seemed to have the cognitive ability to manage form and content at the same time. Additions and substitutions of information prevailed over the rest, since the writers hardly ever deleted to start again. Despite the similarities between the native and non-native expert writers, further comparisons reveal that the native expert subject showed more concern with meaning, while the non-native were worried about grammatical correctness, which may be due to the greater emphasis that they receive in L 2 writing classes. Also, the subjects displayed different revision patterns, which supports the belief that there is no single revision pattern resulting in successful prose. The native novice subjects made higher percentages of final version revisions, while the non-native were more inclined to making premature revisions, coupled with large numbers of revisions in an attempt to reduce the cognitive load that revising entailed on their minds. The pre-draft, between-draft and the combinations of drafts were virtually of no importance and, thus, the writers did not go back and forth between their essays and outlines to add changes or to check how well the drafts matched their outlines. Yet, both writer types redirected their attention to meaning towards the latest stages of writing and, therefore, they were not insensitive to revision at the higher discourse levels, contrary to the beliefs commonly held for novice writers. El objetivo de esta investigación es describir los procesos de escritura y aprendizaje de escritores nativos y no nativos expertos e inexpertos mientras escribían un texto argumentativo en inglés. El análisis de los procesos de revisión de los escritores experimentados y menos experimentados sirven como punto de partida para contestar cuatro preguntas principales: 1. ¿Cuándo se dan las revisiones en el proceso de escritura? 2. ¿Hay similitudes y diferencias en las categorías de revisión que los participantes usaron? 3. ¿Hay similitudes y diferencias en las técnicas que los participantes emplearon? 4. ¿Hay similitudes y diferencias en los propósitos de las revisiones de los participantes? Estas mismas preguntas se plantearon para observar las similitudes y diferencias entre los escritores experimentados nativos y no nativos y entre los escritores no experimentados nativos y no nativos de inglés. Los resultados indican que los escritores expertos y no expertos nativos y no nativos de este estudio hicieron cambios en las dos sesiones de escritura, en los cuatro ciclos de escritura, así como en las combinaciones guion/primer borrador y borrador intermedio/borrador final aunque revisaron en diferente medida. Los escritores experimentados, sin embargo, revisaron a niveles discusivos más altos con más frecuencia que los menos experimentados, aunque los menos expertos no son completamente inconscientes de la necesidad de hacer revisiones de significado. Los escritores experimentados y menos experimentados nativos y no nativos coincidieron en su preferencia por la revisión a nivel de la palabra en todos los borradores y sesiones de escritura. No hicieron cambios que afectaran la estructura global del texto puesto que implicaban un mayor esfuerzo cognitivo. A pesar de las similitudes los escritores expertos nativos mostraron un mayor interés por el significado, mientras los no nativos se preocuparon de la corrección gramatical de sus textos. Los escritores nativos no expertos hicieron un mayor número de revisiones en el borrador final que los no nativos menos experimentados, mientras éstos revisaron en fases demasiado avanzadas del proceso de escritura además de hacer un gran número de ellas en un intento de reducir la carga cognitiva que revisar imponía en sus mentes.

40|$|Abstract. It is {{generally}} believed {{that students should}} use multiple representations in solving certain physics problems, and earlier work in PER has begun to outline how <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices</b> differ {{in their use of}} multiple representations. In this study, we build on this foundation by interviewing <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> physicists as they solve two types of multiple representations problems: those in which multiple representations are provided for them, and those in which the students must construct their own representations. We analyze in detail the types of representations subjects use and the order and manner in which they are used. <b>Expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> representation use is surprisingly similar in some ways, especially in that both <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices</b> make significant use of multiple representations. Some significant differences also emerge. Experts are more flexible in terms of starting point and move between the available representations more quickly, <b>and</b> <b>novices</b> tend to move between more representations in total. In addition, we find that an examination of how often and when multiple representations are used is inadequate to fully characterize a problem-solving episode; one must also consider the purpose behind the use of the available representations. This analysis of how <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices</b> use representations sharpens {{the differences between the two}} groups, demonstrates analysis techniques that may be useful in future work, and suggests possible paths for instruction. ...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that experts {{identify}} or perceive meaningful patterns in visual stimuli related to their domain of expertise. This study explores {{the speed with which}} <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices</b> detect changes in physics diagrams.

The two diagrams in each pair contain a subtle difference that either does or does not change the underlying physics depicted in the diagram. Findings indicate that experts are faster at detecting physics-relevant changes than physics-irrelevant changes; however, there is no difference in response time for novices, suggesting that expertise guides attention for experts when inspecting physics diagrams.

40|$|Background: Research {{indicates}} <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> teachers communicate differently during instruction. However, {{these differences}} {{have yet to}} be investigated in relation to student learning. Receiver selectivity theory offers an interpretive framework for understanding how expert-novice communication differences might function to discriminate student learning when it is defined as the student’s ability to recall the most important information the teacher intended to communicate. Purpose: This study examined <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> golf instructors’ communication and student learning using receiver selectivity as a theoretical framework. Specifically, student recall was investigated in relation to the teachers’ communication behaviors and the perceived outcomes of these behaviors. Participants and setting: Stage theory guided the selection of four <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> four <b>novice</b> female golf instructors (n ¼ 8). Eight students, who were male and female and varied in age (19 – 26) and skill level, were also recruited for participation. This study was conducted at two golf course driving ranges in Orlando, Florida and by telephone from the researcher’s university. Study design: This study employed a qualitative research design to provide a descriptive account of <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> golf instructors’ communication {{from the perspective of the}} teachers’ students, identify perceived outcomes of teacher communication, and examine student recall. Receiver selectivity theory guided data collection and interpretation of the results. Research techniques were drawn from seminal sourcebooks on semi-structured interviews and data management/reduction. Data collection: Students were assigned to take an individual lesson on the full swing with either an expert or a novice teacher. Following their lessons, the teachers were asked to identify the target information they had intended to communicate to their students. Two weeks later, students were asked by telephone to identify the most important information from their lessons, to describe their teachers’ communication behaviors, and to discuss the perceived outcomes of their teachers’ communication. Data analysis: Teacher and student perceptions of target information were compared to determine if students recalled what teachers had intended to communicate in their lessons. Inductive analysis was used to find patterns of <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> communication behaviors. Student interviews were searched for statements about perceived outcomes of teacher communication. Findings: Seven of the eight students recalled the target information their teachers had intended to communicate. Themes in the teachers’ communication behaviors revealed expert-novice differences but perceived outcomes of teacher communication were positive – and in some cases, the same – for both groups. Conclusions: Positioned against receiver selectivity theory, the findings indicate both <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> teachers successfully engaged students in the learning process. Teacher behaviors (both <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice)</b> <b>and</b> their perceived outcomes support previous research highlighting strategies for increasing student learning. Distinctive elements of this study, including nonverbal behaviors that were featured and the one student to one teacher ratio, are important considerations for explaining divergent findings between this study and those of previous research comparing the expositive discourse of <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> classroom teachers...|$|R

30|$|Holistic {{processing}} {{is often}} {{characterized as a}} process by which objects are perceived as a whole rather than a compilation of individual features. This mechanism may {{play an important role}} in the development of perceptual expertise because it allows for rapid integration across image regions. The present work explores whether holistic processing is present in latent fingerprint examiners, who compare fingerprints collected from crime scenes against a set of standards taken from a suspect. We adapted a composite task widely used in the face recognition and perceptual expertise literatures, in which participants were asked to match only a particular half of a fingerprint with a previous image while ignoring the other half. We tested both <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices,</b> using both upright and inverted fingerprints. For upright fingerprints, we found weak evidence for holistic processing, but with no differences between <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices</b> with respect to holistic processing. For inverted fingerprints, we found stronger evidence of holistic processing, with weak evidence for differences between <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices.</b> These relatively weak holistic processing effects contrast with robust evidence for holistic processing with faces and with objects in other domains of perceptual expertise. The data constrain models of holistic processing by demonstrating that latent fingerprint <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices</b> may not substantively differ in terms of the amount of holistic processing and that inverted stimuli actually produced more evidence for holistic processing than upright stimuli. Important differences between the present fingerprint stimuli and those in the literature include the lack of verbal labels for <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> the absence of strong vertical asymmetries, both of which might contribute to stronger holistic processing signatures in other stimulus domains.|$|R

40|$|Research {{on crime}} scene {{investigation}} has strongly {{focused on the}} technical aspects of the process, while cognitive aspects (searching, reasoning and perception) have often been overlooked. Textbooks on forensic sciences tend to focus on identifying and processing evidence, and the use of equipment while {{it can be argued that}} cognitive factors in processing such evidence and using equipment are equally important. This thesis studies the cognitive aspects of crime scene investigation by comparing eye movement patterns in <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices.</b> Studies in various domains, including surgery, sports, and chess playing have shown that eye movements differ between <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices,</b> providing a tool towards a more objective assessment of skill than is possible with peer assessment. In four experiments eye movements of <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices</b> were examined during (1) inspection of photographs of crime scenes on a computer screen (2) a change blindness task on crime and non-crime scene images, (3) active exploration of a simulated crime scene and (4) the assessment of emotional crime and natural scenes. While some trends in eye movement differences, such as a tendency on longer fixation durations and a broader focus on the overall scene and less on the direct evidence could be found in experts compared to <b>novices,</b> differences between <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices</b> were considerably smaller than in other domains, despite the broad range of measures extracted from the data. This lack of clear expertise effects may relate to the rather diverse range of perceptual layouts of crime scenes, reducing possible top-down effects of expertise on the deployment of attention.

40|$|In a {{wide range}} of {{problem-solving}} settings, the presence of a familiar solution can block the discovery of better solutions (i. e., the Einstellung effect). To investigate this effect, we monitored the eye movements of <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> chess players while they solved chess problems that contained a familiar move (i. e., the Einstellung move), as well as an optimal move that was located in a different region of the board. When the Einstellung move was an advantageous (but suboptimal) move, both the <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> chess players who chose the Einstellung move continued to look at this move throughout the trial, whereas the subset of expert players who chose the optimal move were able to gradually disengage their attention from the Einstellung move. However, when the Einstellung move was a blunder, all of the <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> the majority of the novices were able to avoid selecting the Einstellung move, <b>and</b> both the <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices</b> gradually disengaged their attention from the Einstellung move.
