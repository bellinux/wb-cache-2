5|$|Seara disappeared, {{together}} with Minerva, Libertatea, Steagul {{and most other}} Germanophile papers, in late summer 1916, shortly after Romania declared war on the Central Powers.

This was notably pursued by Arghezi, Galaction, Bărbulescu and Karnabatt, all of whom wrote for the propaganda tribune Gazeta Bucureștilor. According to popular rumors, Bogdan-Pitești fell out of favor with the occupiers, who eventually <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been squandering their grants.|$|E

His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds.
