500|$|Certain {{features}} of divine images are more useful than others in determining a god's identity. The {{head of a}} given divine image is particularly significant. In a hybrid image, the head represents the original form of the being depicted, so that, as the Egyptologist Henry Fischer put it, [...] "a lion-headed goddess is a lion-goddess in human form, while a royal sphinx, conversely, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> assumed {{the form of a}} lion." [...] Divine headdresses, which range from the same types of crowns used by human kings to large hieroglyphs worn on gods' heads, are another important indicator. In contrast, the objects held in gods' hands tend to be generic. Male deities hold was staffs, goddesses hold stalks of papyrus, and both sexes carry ankh signs, representing the Egyptian word for [...] "life", to symbolize their life-giving power.|$|E
2500|$|Agunah ( [...] , plural: agunot (עגונות); {{literally}} [...] "anchored" [...] or [...] "chained") is a halachic {{term for}} a Jewish woman who is [...] "chained" [...] to her marriage. The classic case of this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> left on a journey and has not returned, or has gone into battle and is MIA. It is used a borrowed term {{to refer to a}} woman whose husband refuses, or is unable, to grant her a divorce document in Jewish religious law, known as a get.|$|E
60|$|In my judgment, <b>a</b> Liberal <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> {{ought to}} {{stand as a}} {{restraining}} force against an extravagant policy. He <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> ought to keep cool {{in the presence of}} Jingo clamour. He <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> believes that confidence between nations begets confidence, and that the spirit of peace and goodwill makes the safety it seeks. And, above all, I think <b>a</b> Liberal <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> should keep <b>a</b> sour look for scaremongers of every kind and of every size, however distinguished, however ridiculous--and sometimes the most distinguished are the most ridiculous--a cold, chilling, sour look for all of them, whether their panic comes from the sea or from the air or from the earth or from the waters under the earth.|$|R

His show spreads magic, hope, and {{laughter}} through his irrepressible wit and humor to every listener and caller, {{making it difficult to}} imagine that this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been immobilized with a spinal injury for the last fourteen years of his life. Sofia D'Souza (Aishwarya Rai) is his nurse who has been accompanying him for the past twelve years.|$|E

5000|$|... "Medgar <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> {{never wanted}} adoration, {{who never wanted}} to be in the limelight.

6000|$|... 'No man,' said Birkin, 'cuts another man's throat {{unless he}} wants to cut it, and unless the other man wants it cutting. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{complete}} truth. It takes two people to make a murder: a murderer and a murderee. And <b>a</b> murderee <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> murderable.

"Beyond {{the search}} to which every one on board {{will have to}} be subjected," [...] Crawshay replied, [...] "I shall not {{interfere}} in any respect with the three people in question. Mr. Jocelyn Thew, however, is different. He <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> led a most adventurous life.

6000|$|... "You {{mind what}} I called her once, John--a witch-woman? She is that, right enough. This {{marriage}} of hers proves it.

He was but recently arrived, and knows but little of the natives; but he is full of zeal, and it would be well, I think, were we to make an arrangement of which he would perfectly approve; so that his report, when he reached Goa, should be altogether favorable" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Liberty {{under the}} law," [...] I said, with an {{unexpected}} approving murmur from Margaret, {{and took up}} the defence. [...] "The old Liberal definition of liberty was a trifle uncritical. Privilege and legal restrictions {{are not the only}} enemies of liberty. An uneducated, underbred, and underfed propertyless man <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> lost the possibility of liberty. There's no liberty worth a rap for him.

6000|$|His {{companion}} smiled dryly. [...] "I have {{a notion}} {{how she is}} insured, and, so far as I can gather, it's under an economical policy. Underwriters face total constructive loss, but don't stand in for minor damage or salvage. Well, I've ground for believing the thing {{is to be done}} by the engineer, and he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> to do just what Merril tells him. You and Fleming could figure out how he will probably manage. But one thing is clear: when that steamboat's engines give out you have got to be somewhere round to salve her." ...|$|E
