However, he stood at the top of the stairs and decided not to go, eventually deciding to go to architecture school (as his parents wanted) where he met his wife. Kove's inspiration was drawn from the fact that her existence seemed to hinge on that decision, because [...] "if the artist had said, 'Oh, you must paint,' you know, then in all likelihood he would never have met my mother, and, you know, that would have been <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> chances." [...] However, Kove felt the story was too personal, and rewrote it to be fictional.|$|E

According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her.

[...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it.

In 2001, he debuted in professional drama playing Karna (a character from the Indian epic Mahabharata) in Karnabharam, a Sanskrit-language play directed by Kavalam Narayana Panicker. It premiered at the Siri Fort Auditorium in New Delhi on 29 March 2001 {{as part of}} the National Theatre Festival of National School of Drama. The play depicts Karna's mental agony a day before the Kurukshetra War, as he thinks about his past and his faith. Mohanlal said, [...] "You cannot compare Kavalam's play with the amateur plays I did. Though there are other characters in the play, the theme revolves around Karna.

2500|$|An {{examination}} of John's Gospel makes {{it almost impossible}} to deny the identity of Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalen. From John we learn the name of the [...] "woman" [...] who anointed Christ's feet previous to the last supper. We may remark here that it seems unnecessary to hold that because Matthew and Mark say [...] "two days before the Passover", while John says [...] "six days" [...] there were, therefore, two distinct anointings following one another. John {{does not necessarily mean that}} the supper and the anointing took place six days before, but only that Christ came to Bethany six days before the Passover. At that supper, then, Mary received the glorious encomium, [...] "she hath wrought a good work upon Me...in pouring this ointment upon My body she hath done <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>My</b> burial...wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached...that also which she hath done shall be told for a memory of her." [...] Is it credible, in view of all this, that this Mary should have no place at the foot of the cross, nor at the tomb of Christ? Yet it is Mary Magdalen who, according to all the Evangelists, stood at the foot of the cross and assisted at the entombment and was the first recorded witness of the Resurrection. And while John calls her [...] "Mary Magdalen" [...] in 19:25, 20:1, and 20:18, he calls her simply [...] "Mary" [...] in 20:11 and 20:16.|$|E

2500|$|He was incarcerated in Sugamo Prison. Initially, the [...] Japanese {{believed}} that, {{due to his}} Nazi Party {{membership and}} German ties, Sorge was an Abwehr agent. However, the Abwehr denied {{that he was one}} of their agents. Under torture, Sorge confessed, but the Soviet Union denied he was a Soviet agent. The Japanese made three overtures to the Soviet Union, offering to trade Sorge for one of their own spies. However, the Soviet Union declined all the offers, maintaining that Sorge was unknown to them. In September 1942, Sorge's wife Katya Maximova was arrested by the NKVD on the charges that she was a [...] "German spy", since she was married to the German citizen Sorge (that Sorge was a GRU agent did not matter to the NVKD), and was deported to the Gulag. Maximova died in the Gulag in 1943. Hanako Ishii, the Japanese woman who loved Sorge and was the only woman who Sorge loved in return, was the only person who tried to visit Sorge during his time in Sugamo Prison. During one of her visits, she expressed concern that Sorge under torture by the Kempeitai would name her as involved in his spy ring, but he promised her that he would never mention her name to the Kempeitai. The Kempeitai was much feared in Japan for its use of torture as an investigation method. Sorge ultimately struck a deal with the Kempeitai that if they would spare Ishii and the wives of the other members of the spy ring, he would reveal all. Ishii was never arrested by the Kempeitai Sorge told his Kempeital captors: [...] "That I successfully approached the German embassy in Japan and won the absolute trust by people there was the foundation of my organisation in Japan...Even in Moscow that fact that I infiltrated into the centre of the embassy and made use of <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> spying activity is evaluated as extremely amazing, having no equivalent in history".|$|E
