40|$|Part 4 : Infrastructure and TechnologyInternational audienceElectronic Identities (eID) {{and their}} {{cross-border}} recognition are {{on top of}} the agenda of various e-Government initiatives of the European Commission (EC). Therefore, the EC launched the EU large scale pilot STORK, which was running for about 3. 5 years and finished at the end of 2011. In this period, STORK has established a European eID interoperability platform for citizens. The focus of STORK was to achieve eID interoperability of natural persons. However, many e-Government processes are conducted by representatives of legal persons. Hence, this paper proposes an eID interoperability framework for the cross-border identification and authentication of legal persons or professional representatives using <b>electronic</b> <b>mandates.</b> The framework strongly bases on the findings of STORK and introduces an extension of the STORK framework supporting cross-border identification and authentication of legal persons...|$|R

These latter cards are not attractive to the average customer since they attract both a monthly fee from the credit company and a bank account fee for each day's debits.

40|$|I use an <b>electronic</b> {{transfer}} <b>mandate</b> in the UK Child Benefit program, {{a transfer}} received by virtually all families with children, {{to estimate the}} effect of bank account ownership on the financial behavior of less educated families with children. With the mandate increasing account ownership {{by as much as}} 29 percent for less educated families with children, it provides an exogenous increase in account ownership to examine the causal effect of bank account ownership on access to credit, purchase of household durable goods, vehicle ownership, vehicle purchase, and accumulation of financial assets. When a less educated family becomes an owner of a bank account, I find a 71 percentage point increase in the probability of owning a credit card, an increase of 1. 4 household durable goods, and no change in vehicle ownership or purchase. Although I find that bank account ownership does not affect the mean level of financial assets, I do find evidence suggestive of an increase in {{the top half of the}} financial asset distribution which indicates that there may be heterogeneity in the savings response to owning a bank account. Overall, my findings suggest that the most important benefit of owning a bank account is access to credit and requiring lower income families to own a bank account will not reverse their low average savings levels in the short run...|$|R
50|$|Retailers {{are pushing}} for tagging each {{individual}} item. In fact, large companies like Wal-Mart, JC Penney, and Dillard’s are issuing <b>electronic</b> product code <b>mandates,</b> where they request their suppliers to comply with these EPC protocols. In 2005, it was required that the suppliers use RFID tagging at the pallet and case level, {{but now it is}} required that they tag on the item-level as well. The reason {{why is it so important}} for them to implement this is because they want to avoid losing a sale over an out-of-stock item, which they believe accounts for a big part of their losses. Also, if they know where an item is at all times then it easier to move it to where it is supposed to be. By doing this they reduce transportation costs, they gain added shelf visibility and it drives down wasteful overstock.|$|R

Librarians serving as lecturers in the Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine Department in the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of California, Davis, have included a host of computerized information resources in the structure of a three-unit credit course entitled EPM 401 : Biomedical Information Resources and Retrieval. The course is required for veterinarians in the Masters in Preventive Medicine Program, and is an elective for veterinary students. Resources in electronic format covered by the course include the University of CaliforniaÃ¢ s MELVYL online catalog, the CAB Abstracts and Compact Cambridge Life Sciences Collection databases in CD-ROM format, the MEDLINE and Current Contents databases available on the MELVYL system, and bibliographic file management software programs. Students are introduced to the concepts of Boolean searching and are furnished opportunities for Ã¢ hands-onÃ¢ practice. Computer terminals in the public area of the Carlson Health Sciences Library as well as microcomputers in the libraryÃ¢ s Microcomputer Facility are employed in the class.

40|$|Much {{has been}} written about the need to {{videotape}} the entire process of police interrogation of suspects. Videotaping discourages abusive interrogation techniques, improves police training in proper techniques, reduces frivolous suppression motions, and improves jury decision making about the voluntariness and accuracy of a confession. Despite these benefits, only a small number of states have adopted legislation <b>mandating</b> <b>electronic</b> recording of the entire interrogation process. In the hope of accelerating legislative adoption of this procedure and of improving the quality of such legislation, the Uniform Law Commission (ULC) ratified a uniform recording statute for consideration by the states. I was the Reporter for this ULC effort. This Article focuses on the Act’s most interesting and novel provisions: those affecting remedies for police failure to record when required. The Act creates two remedies: suppression of confessions rendered “unreliable” by the failure to record and a cautionary jury instruction. This Article explains and defends both options. In addition, it challenges ULC’s choice to exclude expert testimony as another remedial option. Furthermore, this Article defends the Act’s exemption of police departments from civil liability if they enforce well-drafted rules to promote the Act’s purposes. Ultimately, this Article concludes that, though the Act is not perfect, from a policy perspective, it is an excellent step forward...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} a {{randomised controlled trial}} of mandated five-channel physiological monitoring vs standard care, in acute medical and surgical wards in a single UK teaching hospital. In all, 402 high-risk medical and surgical patients were studied. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients experiencing one or more major adverse events, including urgent staff calls, changes to higher care levels, cardiac arrests or death, in 96 h following randomisation. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients requiring acute treatment changes, and the 30 -day and hospital mortality. In the 96 h following randomisation, 113 (56 %) patients in the monitored arm and 116 (58 %) in the control arm (OR 0. 94, 95 % CI 0. 63 - 1. 40, p = 0. 76) had a major event. An acute change in treatment was necessary in 107 (53 %) monitored patients and 101 (50 %) control patients (OR 0. 55, 95 % CI 0. 87 - 1. 29). Thirty-four (17 %) monitored patients and 35 (17 %) control patients died within 30 days. Thirteen patients {{in the control group}} received full five-channel monitoring {{at the request of the}} ward staff. We conclude that <b>mandated</b> <b>electronic</b> vital signs monitoring in high risk medical and surgical patients has no effect on adverse events or mortality...|$|R
40|$|A DSA Policy is a {{formally}} established set {{of governing}} statements based on law and code objectives, addressing {{any aspect of}} DSA’s plan & construction review program that is not clearly addressed by code. Policy also may specify administrative or technical requirements that are not yet addressed within Title 24, but are deemed important and necessary to fulfill code objectives in advance of adoption into the code. Purpose: The Division of the State Architect (DSA) issued this policy {{in support of the}} Governor’s Green Building Initiative (to conserve resources and money and to protect the environment) by implementing a step in DSA’s conversion to a “paperless”, electronic project submittal and plan review process. Electronic plan review conserves time, money, and resources by reducing the cost of document shipping and storage, and reducing the time required for transfer of documents, and travel to meetings. However, in view of economic conditions, the Department of General Services is implementing the Governor’s business plan to promote jobs creation in California. As part of this plan, DSA will suspend <b>mandated</b> <b>electronic</b> plan review in an effort to reduce “bin ” time and expedite plan approval. 1.

40|$|The {{concept of}} Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs) {{is not a}} new one. E-Theses have been openly {{discussed}} by key players in the present worldwide ETD movement since 1987, and even accepted by some universities (e. g. Virginia Tech) since 1994. Presently, the acceptance of e-theses as a viable medium is increasing. This is reflected in the growing number of universities that actually require an electronic version to be submitted. At the last count the number of universities registered with the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD) that actively <b>mandate</b> <b>electronic</b> submission totalled 56, from a diverse background including not only North American and European institutes (e. g. California Institution of Technology, University of Texas at Austin, Virginia Tech), but also universities from South America, Asia and Africa. In contrast, no universities from the UK have adopted this policy, and only a select few are developing an e-theses capability. In order to encourage the disclosure and sharing of content, the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) initiated the Focus on Access to Institutional Resources (FAIR) programme in August 2002. It was under this programme that the Edinburgh University Library (EUL) gained funding for the Theses Alive! project, which began its work in a national effort to promote ETDs in November 2002. The Theses Alive! project is working with two other JISC-FAIR projects investigating electronic theses, namely DAEDALUS, based at Glasgow University Library, and Electronic Theses, based at Robert Gordon University Library...|$|R
40|$|Background The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 {{will provide}} 36 billion to promote {{electronic}} health records {{and the formation}} of regional centers that foster community-wide electronic health information exchange (HIE) with the ultimate goal of a nationwide health information network. Minnesota 2 ̆ 7 s e-Health Law, passed in 2007, <b>mandates</b> <b>electronic</b> health record and HIE participation by all clinics and hospitals. To achieve these goals, small primary care practices must participate. Factors that motivate or prevent them from doing so are examined. Methods From November 10, 2008, through February 20, 2009, we gathered data (through questionnaires and interviews) from 9 primary care practices in Minnesota with fewer than 20 physicians and with varying degrees of electronic health records and HIE involvement. Results No practice was fully involved in a regional HIE, and HIE was not part of most practices 2 ̆ 7 short-term strategic plans. External motivators for HIE included state and federal mandates, payer incentives, and increasing expectations for quality reporting. Internal motivators were anticipated cost savings, quality, patient safety, and efficiency. The most frequently cited barriers were lack of interoperability, cost, lack of buy-in for a shared HIE vision, security and privacy, and limited technical infrastructure and support. Conclusions Currently, small practices do not have the means or motivation to fully participate in regional HIEs, but many are exchanging health data in piecemeal arrangements with stakeholders with whom they are not directly competing for patients. To achieve more comprehensive HIE, regional health information organizations must provide leadership and financial incentives for community-wide meaningful use of interoperable electronic health records...|$|R
5000|$|Access {{was given}} to the Department of State and the INS to certain {{identifying}} information in the criminal history records of visa applicants and applicants for admission to the United States. The information that may be exchanged include the criminal history record information contained in the National Crime Information Center's Interstate Identification Index (NCIC-III), Wanted Persons File and any other files maintained by the National Crime Information Center. Such information is provided as an extract from an automated visa lookout system or other appropriate database, and is provided free of charge. However, for the Department of State to obtain the full criminal record, it must first submit the applicant's fingerprints to the Criminal Justice Information Services Division of the FBI. The Department of State was required to form final regulations that govern the procedures for taking fingerprints and the conditions with which the department was allowed to use such information. The final regulations are specified in 22 CFR 40.5. Additionally, a technology standard to become the technology basis for a cross-agency, cross-platform <b>electronic</b> system was <b>mandated</b> to be developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to be used to verify the identity of persons applying for a United States for the purposes of conducting background checks, confirming identity, and ensuring that a person has not received a visa under a different name. This report was released on November 13, 2002, however, according to NIST, this was later [...] "determined that the fingerprint system used was not as accurate as current state-of-the-art fingerprint systems and is approximately equivalent to commercial fingerprint systems available in 1998" [...] This report was later superseded by section 303(a) of the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: Adverse patient {{events have}} been linked to {{communication}} errors during handoff. The Joint Commission has estimated that 65 % of adverse patient events are associated with issues in communication. This, coupled with <b>mandated</b> <b>electronic</b> medical record (EMR) adoption in 2009, has complicated the implementation of effective handoffs. Many EMR systems are ill equipped to provide effective handoff tools, leading to staff non-compliance and a system of varied handoff procedures. Purpose: To determine the barriers to nurses utilization of the EMR based handoff tool in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Methods: This study was a longitudinal pre-post analysis design, aimed at highlighting nursing staff likes and dislikes of the current EMR based handoff tool in the PICU. Using the pre-test data, a quality improvement (QI) project {{in the form of an}} in-service that provided handoff tool “cheat sheets,” was implemented to improve usability of the handoff tool and communication during change of shift report. A post-project survey was issued two months after the implementation of the QI project, to re-evaluate staff perceptions of the handoff tool/change of shift report. Pre and post hand-off tool use data was provided by unit management. Results: The results and implications of this study are confidential protected information with the collaborating institution. The analysis and presentation of the results as well as the implications for this study was disseminated to the supervising St. John Fisher faculty and the collaborating institution and as was found to meet accepted guidelines for successful completion of the project for the purposes of completing degree requirements. Conclusion: Current handoff tool literature shows that staff will willingly use handoff tools that are user friendly and well integrated into the EMR, but will abandon the use of tools that are not. Improving handoff tool use in the PICU could lead to improved communication, organization, and time spent giving report; thus impacting patient safety by avoiding adverse events related to communication errors. Future research and QI projects should focus on how to engage staff to be more compliant with actually using the handoff tool...|$|R

There are 45 Central Universities, 318 State Universities, 185 Private Universities, 128 Deemed-to-be Universities, 51 Institutions are of national importance. The number of colleges has also registered manifold increase of 74 times with just 500 in 1950 growing to 37, 204, as on 31 st March, 2013. On an average, over 40, 000 Ph. D. theses and M.

UGC vide minimum standard and {{procedure for the award}} of M. Phil. /Ph. D. degree regulation 2009, has <b>mandated</b> <b>electronic</b> submission of theses and dissertations under Open Access in its repository-Shodhganga. The e-theses repository known as Shodhganga has been created by Information Library Network Centre, Ahmadabad. About 65, 000 e-theses have been deposited to Shodhganga by 231 Universities from India. Only 249 Universities from India have formally joined Shodhganga. Over a million Ph. D. theses and dissertations are available with the Indian Universities. So the process of ETD implementation is slow. Still a long way to go. ETD publishing, open access and embargo are some of the issues responsible for the slow process of electronic theses and dissertations. Besides, as per UGC guidelines, it is mandatory for each researcher to contribute at least one paper in reputed journal. How this policy has helped in enhancing research output of Indian Universities? In the paper efforts will be made to identify various problems faced by Indian Universities in implementing ETD programmes. Various embargo policies adopted in Indian Universities will also be discussed. The efforts should also be made to find out status of other ETD publishing initiatives in Indian Universities. The data will be collected through online questionnaire. However, various secondary sources available through internet may also be referred to gather desired information. Ultimate aim is to present a status report on preservation and access to theses and Dissertations in India...|$|R
