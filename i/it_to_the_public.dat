5|$|On July 4, 1916, the Webb {{house was}} {{opened to the}} public with a 25 cent {{admission}} charge, but the American entry into World War I and the rationing of gasoline took its toll on Nutting's business. Nutting sold the house in 1919 to The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in Connecticut, which opened <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> as a historic house museum.|$|E
5|$|The state took Camber Castle into {{guardianship}} in 1967, and {{the next}} year the government began a slow process of restoring the castle with the intention of eventually reopening <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> their efforts largely focusing on protecting the internal brick walls and wall-cores. Further excavations followed in the 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|A {{year into}} development, Activision {{proposed}} that Black Lotus be made {{part of an}} existing franchise and highlighted similarities to the True Crime series; both games were set in open worlds with plots centred on an undercover cop in a criminal organization. Sales of previous True Crime games had been disappointing, but Activision felt the innovations in Black Lotus could revitalize the franchise and make the game successful in its own right. Activision attached the game to the series and revealed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> as True Crime: Hong Kong in November 2009. They delayed the game until 2010 to allow further refinement. During this period Hollywood action editor Tony Ciccone was hired to consult on the game's visual identity and animations.|$|E

This leads to a rivalry that lasts {{until the end of the}} series.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{had issued}} {{commemorative}} coins between 1892 and 1954, {{as a means}} for fundraising for organizations deemed worthy of federal support. A sponsoring organization would be designated in the authorizing legislation, and was permitted to buy up the issue at face value, selling <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> at a premium, and pocketing the difference. Various problems with the issues, including mishandling of distributions and complaints that public coins should not be used for private profit, resulted in firm Treasury Department opposition to such issues, and none were struck after 1954.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, the medieval {{structure}} of the property had become quite limiting for the owners. The buildings {{on either side of}} the tower were then pulled down to allow for the construction of Hall Farm, including a more modern farm house; only the tower survived to become an ancillary farm building. In 1973 the Lonsdale Estate, who owned Hall Farm, placed the tower into the guardianship of the Department of the Environment, who decided to open <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public.</b> An archaeological excavation of the site took place between 1977 and 1979, making it one of only a handful of such sites in Cumbria to have been investigated in this way. In the 21st century the tower is in the care of English Heritage as a tourist attraction, and is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Diệm regime, Thảo was {{designated}} by the head of state Minh and the civilian Prime Minister Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ to create the nucleus of a group called the Council of Notables, and promote <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public.</b> which, as an interim body of prominent civilians, would advise the military junta before it handed over power to an elected legislature under civilian rule. The Council of 60 people, 58 men and 2 women, held its first meeting on 1 January 1964 in Saigon. The council was composed almost entirely of well-known professionals and academics and, as such, was hardly representative of South Vietnamese society; there were no delegates from the agricultural or labour sectors of the economy. It gained a reputation for being a forum of debate, rather than a means of enacting policy change and government programs for the populace. Thơ and Minh assigned Thảo with the task of encouraging a transition to democracy by facilitating the formation of a few political parties. This was ineffective, as many political parties with only a handful of members sprang up and squabbled. Within 45 days of the coup, 62 parties had formed but nothing meaningful resulted. In the end, these efforts proved to be irrelevant as Minh's junta and the accompanying Council of Notables were overthrown {{before the end of the}} month. During this period, Thảo served as the head of military security and played a role in replacing Colonel Đỗ Khắc Mai with Nguyễn Cao Kỳ as the head of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. In the aftermath of the coup, Vietcong attacks increased markedly amid infighting among the Saigon leadership, which Thảo had helped to stir up.|$|E
