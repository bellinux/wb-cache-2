2500|$|During an {{interview}} with the Blackpool Gazette in February 2007, Gayle mentioned that she {{was in the process of}} writing her first novel. The plot involved an unpleasant TV talent-show judge who discovers he is dying. She said: [...] "It's sort of fiction but not fiction but it is made up and true, so when you read it you'll see it's fictional but also real, [...] and I hope it explains a <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> the pop business.". It was never published.|$|E

2500|$|On one {{occasion}} Humph {{announced that they}} had a very distinguished actor as a guest who would join in the game of Mornington Crescent. When the game started, after great ceremony, the penultimate player, the last of the panellists, won on his first move, thus denying the distinguished guest the opportunity to make a single move. The chairman apologised but explained that this was an unavoidable possibility and the guest left without having uttered a word. The show was allegedly inundated with complaints at the treatment of Sir Alec Guinness as on the actual recording Lyttelton can be heard to say, [...] "Well I'm very sorry about that. Rather unfortunate. We would like to go on and ask you a <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> what you're doing currently, Sir Alec, but we do have to hurry on to the next game." [...] This story became a favourite of Lyttelton's, who claimed in interviews that the [...] "distinguished actor" [...] had never actually been named on the show.|$|E
2500|$|Lucca {{decided on}} the Teatro Grande (now the Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi) in Trieste as the {{location}} for the Spring 1848 premiere, but political events in Lombardy postponed it until the autumn. The opera house management felt that Muzio would be capable to handling the staging, but having fled to Switzerland, he became unavailable and the task was handled by Luigi Ricci who, along with his brother Federico, were minor composers of the day. [...] Verdi {{did not attend the}} first performance. However, Verdi's biographer Mary Jane Phillips-Matz feels that Lucca chose a good house and a cast [...] "almost as good as anyone could have mustered in Europe at the time." [...] In addition, she quotes from a long letter which Verdi wrote to the soprano Marianna Barbieri-Nini, who had been his Lady Macbeth at the 1847 premiere of that opera. In the letter, Verdi said that he wanted [...] "to tell you a <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> your pieces", and gives her some very explicit advice on how to sing Gulnara.|$|E

50|$|One of the <b>few</b> <b>things</b> known <b>about</b> Tavium is {{that there}} was metalworking, because coins have been found that were minted there in the early 1st century bearing the likenesses of Marcus Aurelius and Elagabalus. Copper, tin, iron and silver were mined in the nearby mountains. Similar to other Celtic towns of the time, the {{smelting}} and stamping was done by a small group of artisans working in one or two stone huts.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can tell}} us a <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> the deceased, without doubt," [...] Mr. Jacks said,--"his profession, for instance, or his social standing? Perhaps you know {{the reason for his}} coming to Europe?" ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2010, Schnetzer {{appeared}} in {{an episode of}} Law & Order and co-starred on the series Happy Town. He played Max Vandenburg in the film adaptation of The Book Thief (2013). He played Mark Ashton in the movie Pride, released in 2014, and his performance drew positive reviews. Charlotte O'Sullivan, writing for the London Evening Standard, said: [...] "Schnetzer is a New Yorker with an unpromising CV (he {{was one of the}} <b>few</b> good <b>things</b> <b>about</b> The Book Thief) and he's fantastic here".|$|R
5000|$|<b>Few</b> <b>things</b> {{are known}} <b>about</b> the Streibs {{except that they}} launch raids on other worlds and sectors, capture {{isolated}} life-forms from their ships, and quickly retreat {{before they can be}} pursued. They then proceed to perform very cruel experiments upon their [...] "samples", and presumably eliminate them when finished, notably by just spacing them.|$|R

She has several {{children}} and has admitted to being a sufferer of post-natal depression. One of her children was born in 1985 and her character, Naima, was written out of EastEnders {{for a few months}} in order for her to have the baby.

"Well," [...] said Carrie, merrily, [...] "this waggon {{must have}} {{cost you a}} good deal, {{and it is one}} of the <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> Prospect that has never done {{anything}} to warrant its being there.

Seeing {{that he can not}} fix it, he asks the girls to go to the store to buy him something, so he can stay alone and call his dad (Fred Willard) to tell him what to do.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} sources of {{information}} about the frumentarii, inscriptions on gravestones and anecdotes where the actions of individual frumentarii are mentioned by historians. From what is known of the Frumentarii, they always worked in uniform. The Empire was based on patronage, not on ideology (until Theodosius I). From inscriptions; one of the <b>few</b> <b>things</b> known <b>about</b> the frumentarii is that they were mostly attached to individual legions, except for a few centurion frumentarii. Attachment to individual legions suggests that their main function was, as the name suggests, to service those legions with supplies.|$|R
50|$|The <b>few</b> more notable <b>things</b> <b>about</b> Kavindapadi are sugar {{storage area}} and sugar market,weekly market and Vijayan Theater,Valarmathi Theater, Mariamman temple festival, Kaaliamman temple festival.

[...] "Why, even you came the term after I did, sir. I remember your asking our names in form your first lesson.

6000|$|... "They can't fool me," [...] he said angrily, [...] "I know 'em. Do you {{see that}} fellow gettin' up to talk now? Well, I could tell you a <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> him, all right. He comes from Glasgow, and his name's Letchworth.

'It's named Rocky Springs, and they're {{building}} a Masonic temple, {{and it looks like}} the Democratic candidate for mayor is going to get soaked by a Pop, and Judge Tucker's wife, who has been down with pleurisy, is getting some better. I had a talk on these liliputian thesises before I could get a siphon in the fountain of knowledge that I was after. And there's a bank there called the Lumberman's Fidelity and Plowman's Savings Institution. It closed for business yesterday with $23,000 cash on hand. It will open this morning with $18,000--all silver-- that's the reason I didn't bring more. There you are, trade and capital. Now, will you be bad?' ...|$|E
50|$|Composer John Harbison adapted Bly's {{translations}} for his Mirabai Songs. There is {{a documentary}} film A <b>Few</b> <b>Things</b> I Know <b>About</b> Her by Anjali Panjabi.

TV series, Meera (2009-2010) was also based on her life.|$|R
50|$|She {{says that}} {{politics}} {{were one of}} the <b>few</b> <b>things</b> she argued <b>about</b> with her husband. She was known to help artists who were suffering from political persecution. Two of her grandchildren were imprisoned and in exile and her home was searched for them. PiÃ±a Torres also refused to move back to Barcelona because of the crimes against art that were committed there, such as destroying frescoes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Few</b> <b>things</b> {{are known}} <b>about</b> the author, Bartholomaeus of Neocastro. It {{is known that}} he was a bureaucrat from Messina who first practiced law before {{assuming}} bureaucratic assignments with the Aragonese court of the Kingdom of Sicily. These included several delicate diplomatic missions. It is in this position that Bartholomaeus was a direct and close witness to the narrated series of events. In some cases, he was a spectator from the inside.|$|R
60|$|But if {{you must}} be in the struggle, the more reason you should know why, before it begins, and have a say in the {{decision}} whether it is to begin. The youth who went to the war had no such knowledge, no such say; I am sure the survivors, of whom there must be a number here to-day, want you to be wiser than they were, and are certainly determined to be wiser next time themselves. If you are to get that partnership, which, once gained, is to be for mutual benefit, it will be, I should say, by banding yourselves with these men, not defiantly but firmly, not for selfish ends but for your country's good. In the meantime they have one bulwark; they have a General who is befriending them as I think never, after the fighting was over, has a General befriended his men before. Perhaps the seemly thing would be for us, their betters, to elect one of these young survivors of the carnage to be our Rector. He ought now to know a <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> war that are worth our hearing. If his theme were the Rector's favourite, diligence. I should be afraid of his advising a great many of us to be diligent in sitting still and doing no more harm.|$|E
60|$|But in our {{particular}} case {{there was another}} perturbing factor. The sun, in its annual march north through the heavens, was increasing its declination. On the 19th parallel of north latitude {{in the middle of}} May the sun is nearly overhead. The angle of arc was between eighty-eight and eighty-nine degrees. Had it been ninety degrees it would have been straight overhead. It was on another day that we learned a <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> taking the altitude of the almost perpendicular sun. Roscoe started in drawing the sun down to the eastern horizon, and he stayed by that point of the compass {{despite the fact that the}} sun would pass the meridian to the south. I, on the other hand, started in to draw the sun down to south-east and strayed away to the south-west. You see, we were teaching ourselves. As a result, at twenty-five minutes past twelve by the ship's time, I called twelve o'clock by the sun. Now this signified that we had changed our location on the face of the world by twenty- five minutes, which was equal to something like six degrees of longitude, or three hundred and fifty miles. This showed the Snark had travelled fifteen knots per hour for twenty-four consecutive hours--and we had never noticed it! It was absurd and grotesque. But Roscoe, still looking east, averred that it was not yet twelve o'clock. He was bent on giving us a twenty-knot clip. Then we began to train our sextants rather wildly all around the horizon, and wherever we looked, there was the sun, puzzlingly close to the sky-line, sometimes above it and sometimes below it. In one direction the sun was proclaiming morning, in another direction it was proclaiming afternoon. The sun was all right--we knew that; therefore we were all wrong. And the rest of the afternoon we spent in the cockpit reading up the matter in the books and finding out what was wrong. We missed the observation that day, but we didn't the next. We had learned.|$|E

50|$|Patriarch Gregory III, surnamed Mammis or Îœammas, was Ecumenical Patriarch {{during the}} period 1443-1450. <b>Few</b> <b>things</b> are known <b>about</b> {{his life and his}} patriarchate. Not even his surname is certain, with the names Mammis or Mammas being {{probably}} mocking appellations. In the generally unreliable Chronicum Majus of George Sphrantzes, it is recorded that he came from Crete, and that his real name was Melissenos. In other works he is referred to as Melissenos-Strategopoulos.|$|R
5000|$|Brian Lash, {{founder of}} blog-to-audio service Ch4tter, {{expressed}} support for the project on his blog.
