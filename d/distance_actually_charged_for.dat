In 2004 Ottawa experienced a 190 million liter raw sewage spill into the Ottawa River.

40|$|Many {{decentralized}} wastewater reuse {{systems have}} been constructed in Beijing. However their performance {{is not as good}} as expected. The total amount of reclaimed water used in Beijing is much less than the designed capacity. In order to understand the reasons causing such poor performance, an integrated financial and economic feasibility analysis for the decentralized wastewater reuse systems in Beijing is carried out in this paper. The monetary values of all the major economic, environmental and social effects are quantified. The financial analysis is made from the viewpoint of the project manager, while the economic analysis is done from the angle of government. The results show that the decentralized wastewater reuse systems in Beijing are economically but not financially feasible. It is found that the low rate <b>actually</b> <b>charged</b> <b>for</b> reclaimed water is an important reason for the system not being financially feasible. The decentralized wastewater reuse systems in Beijing may not continue to operate if the financial problems are not solved...|$|R

50|$|Seattle FilmWorks {{was renamed}} PhotoWorks.com. In 2000, six plaintiffs took {{legal action against}} PhotoWorks at King County Superior Court, Seattle. The action alleged that FilmWorks had engaged in {{deceptive}} practices as its film could only be developed by the company and that 'free' rolls of film were <b>actually</b> <b>charged</b> <b>for.</b> The company settled the claims out-of-court, and promised to give 900,000 free rolls of C-41 film to its customers within one year and 300,000 rolls to customers that did not qualify {{as part of the}} first group but who requested a roll in the following six months. PhotoWorks also agreed to stop claiming its film could only be developed by PhotoWorks. In 2001, PhotoWorks operated 35 retail outlets, but began closing them as it concentrated upon its mail order and internet business. By August 2003, only eight of these outlets remained when the company announced that these would be closed by the end of September 2003. PhotoWorks discontinued all film processing in 2010 after it was purchased by American Greetings. PhotoWorks ceased operations in all forms in early 2011 and sold its customer list to Shutterfly.|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the fees charged by Swedish dentists for root fillings, coronal restorations and further dental interventions during a follow-up period of 5 - 6 years. METHODOLOGY: A total of 248, 299 root fillings were {{linked with the}} tooth, {{the patient and the}} provider and entered into the Swedish Social Insurance Agency register in 2009. The data register also recorded the subsidy-based (scheduled) fee and the fee <b>actually</b> <b>charged</b> <b>for</b> the root fillings. Fees <b>charged</b> <b>for</b> direct or indirect coronal restorations and additional interventions during the follow-up period were also recorded. One-way ANOVA and T-test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The mean overall fee <b>charged</b> <b>for</b> a root filling was approximately 332 Euro and differed only marginally (13 Euro) from the scheduled fee. The total mean fee for preservation of a root filled tooth was 717 Euro, which included the root canal treatment, the coronal restoration and any additional interventions during the follow-up period. The fees for indirectly restored root filled teeth were significantly higher (1, 105 Euro) than for directly restored teeth (610 Euro), despite further additional treatment (P< 0. 001). The mean fee for teeth which were subsequently extracted was higher (769 Euro) than for the retained teeth (711 Euro) (P< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Fees charged by Swedish dentists for root canal treatment were in accordance with the scheduled fees. The overall mean fee was significantly higher for root filled teeth with indirect restorations than for teeth with direct coronal restorations. However, prospective clinical cost-effectiveness studies are needed to analyse the total costs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|At present, an {{affordable}} and convenient means {{for consumers to}} accurately measure the power consumption of the electrical devices in their homes is not readily available. However, if a consumer is able to measure the AC power drawn from a particular household circuit, then {{they would be able}} to calculate the cost of operating that piece of equipment [2]. Comparisons could then be made between similar machines, to see which consumes the most energy. In addition, the meter could facilitate troubleshooting a device that may be causing problems (i. e. frequently tripping a breaker). Therefore, the design must be flexible enough to accommodate measurements over a range of devices found in the average American home [1]. In addition, the power factor must be known in order to accurately calculate the average, or real, power, the kind that the utility companies <b>actually</b> <b>charge</b> you <b>for.</b> The meter should be able to sense values up to 120 Vrms and 30 A, respectively, to accommodate a range of typical household devices.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Article is to {{identify}} and discuss the numerous laws that Cohle broke {{during the course of}} the eight episodes – each episode is discussed separately in Sections II through IX. Here, an extremely important point needs to be made – this Article is not intended to pinpoint exactly how many laws that Cohle would likely be convicted of violating; rather, as is the case generally in the legal profession, many of the actual offenses and charges would be subject to prosecutorial discretion and therefore reasonable minds may disagree with the exact charge. To the extent possible, this Article discusses the potential criminal charges that may be brought against Cohle but clearly understands that the actual number and degree may vary greatly, particularly in different jurisdictions and with different prosecutors. To that end, the Article will only tally and calculate potential state law charges but may make reference to some potential federal crimes where applicable. In an effort to keep track of the various charges and potential maximum sentence, the Article will keep the Cohle Crime Count (“CCC”) and Cohle Maximum Sentence Tally (“CMST”) after each potential charge in the footnotes and will assume a potential consecutive sentence. Further, since the show takes place in three distinct time periods, to avoid any confusion, the current statutes will be cited – even though in criminal proceedings the law at the time of the commission of the crime is applicable and no statute of limitations will apply. Additionally, in Sections II, A. and V, A., the Article will briefly address a few of the more critical legal issues raised in the show. For example, it will posit that Cohle’s entire videotaped interview in 2012 – when he was the subject of an investigation similar to the Dora Lange murder from 1995 – would have been admissible in a subsequent proceeding against him, if any, regardless of the fact that he had been drinking alcohol purchased by and provided to him by the investigating detectives, Detective Maynard Gilbough and Detective Thomas Papania. Moreover, if Cohle was <b>actually</b> <b>charged</b> <b>for</b> any crimes while conducting his rogue investigation in Episodes Four and Five, the Article discusses his potential defense of acting in an undercover capacity and concludes such a defense would likely not be successful. By the end, the Article will quantify, with some degree of specificity, Cohle’s statement that, throughout the course of the show, he did in fact do “terrible things” with impunity...|$|R
