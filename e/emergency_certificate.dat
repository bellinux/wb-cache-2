The findings were reported to the School Board and the District’s administration. A prior audit of professional employees’ certification for the period May 1, 2005 through June 11, 2008, found that one individual employed as a long-term substitute teacher did not hold the appropriate <b>emergency</b> <b>certificate,</b> and one individual was providing instruction on an expired Instructional I certificate.

40|$|One {{important}} {{event in the}} history of teacher certification in the United States was the establishment of a state-controlled teacher training and certification system {{in the first half of}} the 20 th century. When examining the structure of the teacher certification system of that period, the following aspects cannot be overlooked. 1. The effects of supply-demand relationships on the requirements for the acquisition of certificates, especially the features of the emergency certificates issued during World War II. 2. The Influences of the conversion program and the new problems concerning <b>emergency</b> <b>certificate</b> in the fifties. In Japan very few investigators have referred to these issues. Even in the United States, only brief analyses of these issues have been made. The results of the author's research of these issues are summarized as follows. The two world wars caused shortages of teachers. During World War I, the shortage of teachers was particularly serious in rural schools, where usually only one teacher was assigned to each school. A large number of emergency certificates were issued during World War II. Some states issued a variety of certificates, each requiring a different academic level. Relatively high level emergency certificates were sometimes issued only to individuals who had actually satisfied requirements equivalent to those for receiving ordinary certificates. Emergency certificates were often issued to middle-aged or older individuals who had stopped teaching many years before. These teachers were sometimes less than skillful at teaching and unable to accept new teaching techniques and approaches. To resolve these problems, summer training programs for teachers with emergency certificates were offered after the end of the war. Although it has been pointed out that emergency certificates unfavorably affected the social position of teaching professionals, it is noteworthy that in around 1947, when the number of emergency certificates issued reached a peak, states took actions to improve the educational levels required for the acquisition of teacher certificates...|$|E

40|$|Few {{issues in}} our {{elementary}} and secondary schools are subject to more debate and discussion than the quality of teachers. Over the past decade, dozens of studies, commissions, and national reports have bemoaned our failure to ensure that all our nation 2 ̆ 7 s classrooms are staffed with qualified teachers. In turn, reformers in many states have pushed tougher licensing standards for teachers and more rigorous academic requirements for teaching candidates. Moreover, a whole host of initiatives and programs have sprung up for the purpose of recruiting new candidates into teaching. Among these are programs designed to entice mid-career professionals from other fields to become teachers; alternative certification programs, whereby college graduates can postpone formal education training, obtain an <b>emergency</b> teaching <b>certificate,</b> and begin teaching immediately; and Peace Corps-like programs, such as Teach For America, that are designed to lure the 2 ̆ 2 best and brightest 2 ̆ 2 into understaffed schools...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Problem While {{the primary}} {{emphasis}} {{of this study}} was on the professional aspects of a business teacher's preparation, by necessity it was concerned with other aspects of the preparation of business teachers, especially as these relate to the so-called "professional sequence. " Thus {{the purpose of the study}} was to seek answers to six basic questions: 1. What are the usual general education requirements? 2. What are the professional education requirements? 3. How much specialized content is essential in the field of business education, including business education methods courses? 4. How much specialized content is essential in the field of business administration? 5. What types of credentials are offered by the fifty state departments of education and their limitations? 6. What is the minimum professional work experience required to qualify for a credential? Procedures Four basic questionnaires were used to obtain data used in this study. One questionnaire was mailed to each of the fifty state departments of education requesting information regarding business teacher certification in each respective state. The three remaining questionnaires were mailed to a jury of recognized authorities in the fields of business administration, business education, and the field of education, asking them to indicate those courses and experiences deemed necessary in the curricula of a business teacher. Summary of Findings Information obtained from the questionnaires sent the fifty state departments of education and the three hundred sixteen noted authorities included in the jury of authorities indicated the following. A lack of uniformity among the fifty states with respect to many certification requirements exist. Data reveal a significant variation in actual state requirements and those suggested by the jurors. Data reveals a great variety of types and kinds of teaching certificates being issued by the fifty state departments of education. Available data tends to support the increasing of certification requirements beyond those currently required by the vast majority of state departments of education. One can conclude from the jury recommendations that the current certification requirements are not sufficient to meet the challenges of business education today. Recommendations On the basis of the findings and conclusions of this study, the following recommendations are presented: 1. A bachelor's degree as the minimum for certification in business education. 2. Where possible, the minimum amount of preparation be increased to five years of college. 3. It is recommended that the states discontinue the issuance of <b>emergency,</b> or temporary, <b>certificates</b> at the earliest possible date. 4. Certificates be renewed every five years with no limit to the number of times they may be renewed. 5. Subject proficiency or specialization be required. 6. The following total curriculum semester hour requirements be considered minimal: a. General Education - 50 semester hours. b. Professional Education - 16 semester hours. c. Specialized Professional Business Education - 20 semester hours. d. Business Administration - 30 semester hours. e. Business Education Methods - 6 semester hours. f. Student Teaching - 6 semester hours. The following courses are recommended as a minimum core curriculum: General Education Social Science English Humanities Mathematics Psychology Speech Professional Education Educational Psychology Tests and Measurements Adolescent and Developmental Psychology Philosophy of Education Audio-Visual Aids Principles of Education Educational Guidance Specialized Professional Business Education Typewriting Business Machines Shorthand Secretarial Practice and Procedures Principles of Business Education Tests and Measurements in Business Education Business Education Methods Courses General Methods in Business Education Methods of Teaching Shorthand Methods of Teaching Typewriting Business Administration Accounting Business Law Economics Electronic Data Processing Business Correspondence and Reports Marketing Finance and Investments Personnel Management Money and Banking Student Teachin...|$|R
