40|$|The large Pueblo Viejo oxide {{gold deposit}} was {{developed}} by weathering of a gold-quartz-pyrophyllite deposit that formed during sedimentation in a small basin in {{the upper part of}} the Los Ranchos Formation, one of the oldest volcanic units in the Greater Antilles. The basin is floored by conglomerates and agglomerates, which grade upward into standstones and carbonaceous sediments that include chert with thin pyrite layers. Plant fossils, which are common in the carbonaceous sediments, indicate that the basin was near a land mass. The mineralized zone is roughly funnel shaped and expands to its maximum hor-izontal dimensions in the carbonaceous ediments. The lower part of the <b>funnel</b> <b>tube</b> contains alunite and diaspore. Pervasive pyrophyllite alteration makes up most of the overlying tube and upper part of the zone, and locally extensive silicification makes up the top of the funnel. Supergene kaolinitc is present in {{the upper part of the}} funnel. Metallic minerals, consisting mostly of pyrite, are found as disseminations, layers...|$|E
40|$|Pollination syndromes involve {{convergent}} evolution towards phenotypes {{composed of}} specific scents, colours or floral morphologies that attract or restrict pollinator access to reward. How these traits might influence the distributions of plant species in interaction with pollinators {{has rarely been}} investigated. We sampled 870 vegetation plots in the western Swiss Alps and classified the plant species into seven blossom types according to their floral morphology (wind, disk, <b>funnel,</b> <b>tube,</b> bilabiate, head or brush). We investigated the environmental features of plots with functional diversity (FD) lower than expected by chance alone to detect potential pollination filtering and related the proportions of the seven blossom types {{to a combination of}} environmental descriptors. From these results, we inferred the potential effect of the pollinator on the spatial distribution of plant species. The vegetation plots with significantly lower FD of blossom types than expected by chance were found at higher altitudes, and the proportions of blossom types were strongly patterned along the same gradient. These results support a biotic filtering effect on plant species assemblages through pollination: disk blossoms became dominant at higher altitudes, resulting in a lower FD. In harsh conditions at high altitudes, pollinators usually decrease in activity, and the openness of the disk blossom grants access to any available pollinator. Inversely, bilabiate blossoms, which are mostly pollinated by bees, were more abundant at lower elevations, which are characterised by greater abundance and diversity of bees. Generalisation through openness of the blossom could be advantageous at high elevations, while specialisation could be a successful alternative strategy at lower elevations. The approach used in this study is purely correlative, and further investigations should be conducted to infer the nature of the causal relationship between plant and pollinator distributions...|$|E

50|$|Bunn-O-Matic {{also came}} out with a {{different}} drip-brew machine. In this type of coffeemaker, the machine uses a holding tank or boiler pre-filled with water. When the machine is turned on, all of the water in the holding tank is brought to near boiling point (approximately 200207 °F or 9397 °C) using a thermostatically-controlled heating element. When water is poured into a top-mounted tray, it descends into a <b>funnel</b> and <b>tube</b> which delivers the cold water {{to the bottom of the}} boiler. The less-dense hot water in the boiler is displaced out of the tank and into a tube leading to the spray head, where it drips into a brew basket containing the ground coffee. The pourover, water displacement method of coffeemaking tends to produce brewed coffee at a much faster rate than standard drip designs. Its primary disadvantage is increased electricity consumption in order to preheat the water in the boiler. Additionally, the water displacement method is most efficient when used to brew coffee at the machine's maximum or near-maximum capacity, as typically found in restaurant or office usage. In 1963, Bunn introduced the first automatic coffee brewer, which connected to a waterline for an automatic water feed.|$|R

These techniques are going to be employed in the new generation of PTR-MS instruments being developed by KORE Technology Ltd.

40|$|Over {{the course}} of the past year, we experimented with {{bacteriophage}} (phage) isolation from both fresh and marine water. We also tested two different chemical flocculation techniques, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and iron chloride. Furthermore, we tested different vesicles in which chemical flocculation occurs, such as separation <b>funnels,</b> centrifuge <b>tubes,</b> and Erlenmeyer flasks. We analyzed the effectiveness of flocculation via florescent microscopy. Each flocculated sample was visually compared to the original unconcentrated sample by staining the DNA with SYBR-Green. A successful concentrated viral sample yielded a 3 ̆e 10 fold increase in overall fluorescence. We found that both iron chloride and PEG were equally as effective in precipitating phage from water. Unfortunately, while the original protocols we read were designed for marine water, we had little success in precipitating phage from marine water. We tested samples of marine water from various locations, and used both methods of chemical flocculation. Despite this experimentation, we did not succeed in precipitating phage from sea water. Fresh water appeared to have a large viral load, as florescence microscopy showed large amounts of virus, even on the unconcentrated sample. Most experiments were done with fresh water since the viral load is high. We are now in the process of utilizing our library of phage pull-downs to isolate, classify and categorize phage by sequence analysis.
