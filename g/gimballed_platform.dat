40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has seen a}} {{dramatic}} expansion in the deployment of Unmanned Airborne Vehicles (UAVs) as witnessed by deployments to Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq. Many low-cost UAVs operate without redundant attitude sensors and are therefore highly vulnerable {{to the failure of}} such sensors. It is common for low-cost UAVs to carry a vision sensor as its primary payload. Given that a human pilot is trained to control an aircraft with respect to a visual horizon under Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC), it is logical to suggest that a similar capability be developed for a UAV in the event of the failure of the primary attitude system. In addition, it potentially gives the capability to estimate the attitude of a gimballed camera, without specifically equipping the <b>gimballed</b> <b>platform</b> with an angular sensor. In this paper, we develop a method for estimating the flight critical parameters of pitch angle, roll angle and the three body rates using horizon detection and optical flow. We achieve this through the use of an image processing front-end to detect candidate horizon lines through the use of morphological image processing and the Hough transform. The optical flow of the image for each candidate line is calculated, and using these measurements, we are able to estimate the body rates of the aircraft. Using an Extended Kalman Filter (EFK), the candidate horizon lines are propagated and tracked through successive image frames, with statisticall...|$|E

40|$|Airborne gravimetry is the {{determination}} of the Earth's gravity field, using aircraft as mobile measurement platforms. For such measurements, there exist two predominant types of instrumentation: 1. Mechanical spring gravimeters, which are mounted on a <b>gimballed</b> <b>platform</b> in order to maintain a constant sensor orientation during the flight, aligned with the local vertical of the gravity field; 2. aircraft body-fixed 'strap-down' Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), containing each one sensor triad of accelerometers and gyroscopes. While IMUs are commonly designed for navigation applications, they also turn out to have several practical advantages also for gravimetric applications, compared to the more established platform-stabilised spring-gravimeters. In particular advantageous are the lower space and energy consumption, the autonomous operation during the flights, the lower sensitivity to turbulence, and the considerably lower acquisition costs. This thesis is a contribution to the improvement of kinematic, IMU-based gravimetry (denoted as strapdown gravimetry). In practice, the predominant source of errors of such systems arises from uncompensated accelerometer drifts. It is shown theoretically, and based on simulations as well, that such drifts are in practice inseparable from the gravity signal which is to be determined. Based on this finding, several accelerometer calibration methods are developed, aiming at the reduction of in-flight accelerometer drifts. In particular, thermal effects are shown to be the predominant error source. The proposed calibration methods are evaluated on real data, taken from five different airborne gravity campaigns. The common airborne gravimetry evaluation methods are summarised and discussed. An IMU-based gravity measurement accuracy of approximately 1 e- 5 m/s^ 2 is verified, being equal or even superior compared to the achievable accuracy of mechanical spring-gravimeters under comparable conditions, which are still the predominant instrumentation for airborne gravimetry...|$|E
40|$|Unmanned {{ground and}} aerial {{vehicles}} (UGVs and UAVs) have strict payload limitations, limited free space affecting on board power availability resulting in limited endurance and operational range. This limitation {{is exacerbated by}} the addition of sensors, actuators and other related equipment needed to accomplish mission objectives in diverse applications. Two energy sources are mainly available for mobile applications; batteries and fuel cells. Batteries are a relatively cheap, tested technology with good performance under varying loads. On the other hand, fuel cells offer fast and easy refueling solutions. Furthermore, preliminary studies have shown that a hybrid system can combine the advantages of both technologies offering a superior system. It is true that for most outdoors applications, payload needs, sensor suite utilization and energy requirements are apriori unpredictable. This makes proper sizing of energy storage devices and the prediction of remaining available energy rather difficult tasks. This research proposes an indirect way of improving the operational range for UAVs of Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOLs), since the VTOL vehicle is transported to the mission site without the need to fly. The proposed <b>gimballed</b> <b>platform,</b> which will be a power source itself, rotates around two axes perpendicular to each other, allowing the VTOL to take-off and land, regardless of the position of the UGV, while securing it during transportation. The UGV can also serve as a charging station for the VTOL. Furthermore, this research proposes a Matlab Simulation tool that can simulate the energy and power demand of small to mid-sized robotic vehicles. This model will simulate the power consumption in the motors based on Skid steering, road gradient, linear and angular velocity. With the energy and power requirements estimated, a Matlab optimization tool is proposed to be used to determine the optimal configuration of a power system for mobile applications under constraints relating to capacity/runtime, weight, volume, cost, and system complexity. The configuration will be based on commercially available batteries, and fuel cells to significantly reduce cost and delivery time. The optimization tool can be used for any mobile application. Finally, a new model is proposed for the accurate prediction of battery runtime and remaining energy for single battery discharge. This model reformulates Peukert 2 ̆ 7 s equation and achieves higher accuracy by introducing a new concept of variable exponent which is a function of battery capacity and discharge current...|$|E

In computing the altitude difference, the ground slope angle is estimated in a novel way, through two bisectional LiDAR signals, with a practical assumption representing a general ground profile.

40|$|Bulk {{micromachining}} generally {{refers to}} processes involving {{wet chemical etching}} of structures formed out of the silicon substrate and so is limited to fairly large, crude structures. Surface micromachining allows intricate patterning of thin films of polysilicon and other materials to form essentially two-dimensional layered parts (since {{the thickness of the}} parts is limited by the thickness of the deposited films). There is a third type of micromachining in which the part is formed by filling a mold which was defined by photolithographic means. Historically micromachining molds have been formed in some sort of photopolymer, be it with x-ray lithography (``LIGA``) or more conventional UV lithography, with the aim of producing piece parts. Recently, however, several groups including ours at Sandia have independently come {{up with the idea of}} forming the mold for mechanical parts by etching into the silicon substrate itself. In Sandia`s mold process, the mold is recessed into the substrate using a deep silicon trench etch, lined with a sacrificial or etch-stop layer, and then filled with any of a number of mechanical materials. The completed structures are not ejected from the mold to be used as piece parts rather, the mold is dissolved from around selected movable segments of the parts, leaving the parts anchored to the substrate. Since the mold is recessed into the substrate, the whole micromechanical structure can be formed, planarized, and integrated with standard silicon microelectronic circuits before the release etch. In addition, unlike surface-micromachined parts, the thickness of the molded parts is limited by the depth of the trench etch (typically 10 [...] 50 {mu}m) rather than the thickness of deposited polysilicon (typically 2 {mu}m).
