5|$|Pallada {{was built}} by the Admiralty Shipyard in Saint Petersburg. Construction began on 24 June 1905, {{although}} she was not formally laid <b>down</b> <b>until</b> August, and the ship was launched on 10 November 1906. Pallada was completed in February 1911. She spent her entire career with the Baltic Fleet.|$|E
5|$|South Carolina did {{not gain}} a first <b>down</b> <b>until</b> its second drive {{of the second}} quarter, when Garcia {{completed}} a 19-yard pass to Alshon Jeffrey on 3rd-and-16. Maddox's late touchdown allowed the Gamecocks to avoid their first shutout in three seasons. UConn did not commit a single penalty.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} skull, the cranial {{component}} detaches from the spinal component. The spinal accessory nerve continues alone and heads backwards and downwards. In the neck, the accessory nerve crosses the internal jugular vein around {{the level of}} the posterior belly of digastric muscle. As it courses downwards, the nerve pierces through the sternocleidomastoid muscle while sending it motor branches, then continues <b>down</b> <b>until</b> it reaches the trapezius muscle to provide motor innervation to its upper part.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, 40% of the NFL rosters {{had been}} {{drafted into the}} United States Armed Forces for World War II. The {{resulting}} difficulty in fielding a full-strength squad led some owners to recommend the league should shut <b>down</b> <b>until</b> the war ended. Bell auspiciously argued against this as he feared {{they might not be}} able to resume operations easily after the war, and since Major League Baseball was continuing unabated, then they should also.|$|E
5|$|Swordfish {{was ordered}} from Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company on 18 August 1913 {{although}} she was not laid <b>down</b> <b>until</b> 28 February 1914. The start of the First World War six months later greatly hindered her completion, {{and she was not}} launched until 18 March 1916. HMS Swordfish was commissioned on 28 April 1916, before completion, and renamed HMS S1 that same day. She was not completed until 21 July.|$|E

50|$|Whaling {{was one of}} {{the first}} viable {{industries}} established in the Swan River Colony following the 1829 arrival of British settlers to Western Australia. The industry had numerous ups and <b>downs</b> <b>until</b> the last whaling station closed in Albany in 1978.|$|R
5|$|While {{previous}} games {{used only}} a simple life bar, Snake Eater also {{keeps track of}} injuries over the entire body. For example, a long fall could fracture Snake's leg, slowing him <b>down</b> <b>until</b> the injury is properly treated with a splint and bandage.

5|$|After {{two weeks}} {{out of the}} line, the {{division}} attacked the Hindenburg Line itself on 29 September, easily achieving its objectives and capturing 1,000 prisoners. With the New Zealanders on the St. Quentin Canal and the adjacent Scheldt River, a platoon had managed to cross it and reach the village of Crèvecœur. However, it became pinned <b>down</b> <b>until</b> the 1st Auckland and 2nd Wellington Battalions of the 1st Brigade managed to cross {{the next day and}} capture the village. Private James Crichton, a member of the trapped platoon, earned the VC, the last of the war for the New Zealand Division, for his efforts in relaying messages between his companions and his company commander. He also defused demolition charges on the bridge spanning the Scheldt River.|$|E
5|$|East Carolina's defense {{managed a}} strong {{performance}} statistically and in real terms. The most obvious {{examples of this}} were the two interceptions and two forced fumbles. On the first play of the second drive of the second quarter, Boise State quarterback Taylor Tharp threw an interception to defensive back Travis Williams. Williams also recorded eightsolo tackles—the second-highest total for the Pirates–and a forced fumble. The other interception came from defensive back J.J. Milbrook, who also boasted threesolo tackles, tying him for fifth–best on the team. Linebacker Jeremy forced the final Broncos turnover, gaining the ball and fouryards on the play. In addition to his forced fumble, Chambliss recorded four solo tackles. The Pirates' defense as a whole only gave up threeyards {{in the first quarter}} and did not allow a first <b>down</b> <b>until</b> halfway through the second quarter.|$|E
50|$|Baseball had its ups and <b>downs</b> <b>until</b> 1919 - the Maple Leafs {{defeated}} the St. Louis Browns {{in an exhibition}} match in 1876 and in 1894, under a new board of officers, won the semi-pro championship of Canada - when the Inter-County League was established.|$|R

5|$|It {{is known}} that during the Parthian period the court {{minstrel}} (gōsān) recited poetic oral literature accompanied by music. However, their stories, composed in verse form, were not written <b>down</b> <b>until</b> the subsequent Sasanian period. In fact, there is no known Parthian-language literature that survives in original form, since it was written down in the following centuries. It is believed that such stories as the romantic tale Vis and Rāmin and epic cycle of the Kayanian dynasty {{were part of the}} corpus of oral literature from Parthian times, although compiled much later. Although literature of the Parthian language was not committed to written form, there is evidence that the Arsacids acknowledged and respected written Greek literature.|$|E
5|$|Kreml, {{named after}} the Kremlin, was ordered on 20 April 1863 when a {{contract}} was signed with the Russian shipbuilder Semiannikov & Poletika for a total cost of 898,000 rubles. Construction had not yet begun when the Russian Admiralty Board amended the contract on 20 July to shorten the construction time by one year for a payment of an extra 48,000 rubles {{in response to the}} adverse foreign reaction to the brutal Russian suppression of the revolts in Poland and Lithuania that year. Fearing attack by Britain and France, the Board switched priority to the smaller s shortly afterwards in the belief that they could be completed more quickly so that progress on Kreml slowed to a crawl once construction began on 2 October. The ship was not formally laid <b>down</b> <b>until</b> 23 December and she was launched on 26 August 1865.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Icelandic glaciers retreated rapidly {{during the}} warm decades from 1930 to 1960, slowing {{down as the}} climate cooled during the {{following}} decade, and started to advance after 1970. The rate of advance peaked in the 1980s, after which it slowed <b>down</b> <b>until</b> about 1990. As a consequence of rapid warming of the climate {{that has taken place}} since the mid-1980s, most glaciers in Iceland began to retreat after 1990, and by 2000 all monitored non-surge type glaciers in Iceland were retreating. An average of 45 non-surging termini were monitored each year by the Icelandic Glaciological Society from 2000–2005.|$|E
50|$|The Tampa Bay Buccaneers {{traded for}} Stalls to replace an injured {{defensive}} end Wally Chambers. In 1981, {{he was a}} backup end and defensive tackle used mostly on passing <b>downs,</b> <b>until</b> injuries to Bill Kollar and a Lee Roy Selmon's season ending knee injury, forced him to start 9 games at left defensive end.|$|R

5|$|Named {{after the}} Swedish ship {{of the line}} Rättvisan (Justice) which was {{captured}} by the Russians at the Battle of Viborg Bay in 1790, Retvizan was ordered on 2 May 1898 for delivery in thirty months. The detailed sketch design was forwarded {{at the end of}} 1898 to Saint Petersburg for approval and work commenced on the ship around that time, although she was not officially laid <b>down</b> <b>until</b> 29 July 1899 as yard number 300. Construction was delayed by a strike at the shipyard that began in August 1899 and continued until the strike collapsed in early 1900. Other delays were caused by differences between American and Russian shipbuilding techniques and the insistence of the Naval Ministry on approving any design changes even though a Russian commission had been sent to Philadelphia to supervise her construction.|$|E
5|$|New York, Boston, and Philadelphia {{did their}} best to outdo each other in the {{celebrations}} honoring Lafayette. Needing a place to hold a reception for him, Philadelphia renovated the Old State House (today Independence Hall), which might otherwise have been torn <b>down.</b> <b>Until</b> that point, it had not been usual in the United States to build monuments, but Lafayette's visit set off a wave of construction, usually with Lafayette, in his capacity as Mason, laying the cornerstone. The arts benefited by his visits as well, as many cities commissioned portraits for their civic buildings, and the likenesses were seen on innumerable souvenirs. Lafayette had intended to visit only the original thirteen states during a four-month visit; the stay stretched to sixteen months as he visited all twenty-four.|$|E
5|$|Off California, sharks {{immobilize}} northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) {{with a large}} bite to the hindquarters (which is {{the main}} source of the seal's mobility) and wait for the seal to bleed to death. This technique is especially used on adult male elephant seals, which are typically larger than the shark, ranging between , and are potentially dangerous adversaries. Most commonly though, juvenile elephant seals are the most frequently eaten at elephant seal colonies. Prey is normally attacked sub-surface. Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are taken from the surface and dragged <b>down</b> <b>until</b> they stop struggling. They are then eaten near the bottom. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are ambushed from below and struck mid-body before being dragged and eaten.|$|E

25|$|In Japan, {{particularly}} after World War II, asbestos {{was used in}} the manufacture of ammonium sulfate for purposes of rice production, sprayed upon the ceilings, iron skeletons, and walls of railroad cars and buildings (during the 1960s), and used for energy efficiency reasons as well.

5|$|On August 16, 2009, at {{the closing}} {{performance}} of the show Yulong, a set of bleachers with a carrying capacity of 450 people and holding 420 at the time collapsed, sending seven people to the hospital. In the ensuing investigation, it came to light that Juventas had not had the bleachers inspected each time they were set up, as required by their lease with the city. They had been issued a permit in 2006 for the bleachers, and had not had them inspected since. The school was fined $500 and shut <b>down</b> <b>until</b> the legal and safety issues could be fully investigated. It reopened about a month later and installed new bleachers with molded plastic seats the next March.|$|E
5|$|Petr Veliky {{was built}} by the {{state-owned}} Galernii Island Shipyard in Saint Petersburg. Construction began on 1 June 1869, although her keel was not laid <b>down</b> <b>until</b> 23 July 1870. The ship was launched on 27 August 1872, and entered service with the Baltic Fleet on 14 October 1876. She cost a then-staggering sum of over {{five and a half}} million rubles. Two 9-inch mortars were fitted on her quarterdeck during the war scare with Britain during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, but they were removed in 1880 without ever having been used in combat. Two frames for launching Whitehead torpedoes were added to the ship's sides in that same year, but they proved ineffective.|$|E
5|$|Rossia {{was built}} by the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg. Construction began in October 1893 {{although}} she was not formally laid <b>down</b> <b>until</b> 20 May 1895 and launched on 30 April 1896. After her launch, she was towed to Kronstadt for fitting-out, but she was pushed onto a sandbar by a storm and required a month to free her. Rossia entered service in late 1896 and participated in Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Fleet Review in June 1897 at Spithead. She returned to Kronstadt to finish her trials before sailing for the Far East in October. She reached Nagasaki, Japan on 10 March 1898 and remained in the Pacific {{until the beginning of}} the Russo-Japanese War in 1904.|$|E
50|$|During the 19th century, the Taylorstown {{area was}} one of the most densely {{populated}} areas of Loudoun County.
