25|$|After a {{successful}} {{fight with the}} federal Liberal government to re-negotiate the fiscal arrangement of the Atlantic Accord and {{a significant increase in}} oil prices, offshore oil revenues led to record surpluses for the provincial government. The new surpluses led to the Williams government reducing income taxes and significantly increasing government spending.

By the time he left office in 2010, government spending had skyrocketed, his provincial cabinet had increased to 18 ministers {{and the size of the}} public service was significantly larger than when he took office. While government spending was up substantially his government still managed to reduce the province's net debt by roughly $4 billion and Williams was considered one of the most fiscally responsible premier's in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Land of the Dead is {{the first}} film in the series to receive an MPAA rating for its {{theatrical}} release. Romero had said <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> he would film two versions; an R rated cut for theatrical release and first DVD, and an unrated cut for the second DVD release. Both DVDs were released in the U.S. on October 18, 2005. Rumors suggested that Romero shot alternate, less explicit, gore scenes for the theatrical release, {{but this is not}} entirely accurate. The more extreme instances of gore (e.g. a woman having her navel piercing graphically torn out by a zombie) were obscured by foreground elements filmed on bluescreen, so that these overlaid elements could be easily removed for the unrated DVD. Other ways to obscure blood in order to get an R-rating were achieved by simply trimming the grislier shots by a few seconds, by digitally repainting blood so that it is more black than red, or by digitally painting the blood out altogether.|$|E

500|$|The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) {{had complained}} <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> Team Canada faced a {{competitive}} disadvantage in international tournaments {{as it was}} restricted from using its best players, who were professionals in the National Hockey League (NHL), while European teams masked the status of their best players.

In response, the CAHA withdrew Canada from all international competition until the IIHF gave it the right to use its best players as the European teams could.|$|E

[...] While Smith had claimed <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> the video was shot at the same place that inspired the song, he later admitted that the bulk of it was filmed in a studio, utilising footage of the water and cliffs of Beachy Head taken for the band's 1985 video for [...] "Close to Me".|$|E

[...] Dean was curious about Weiland's idea but was aware that the band was contractually obligated to release two more albums. Increasing the uncertainty in the future of a new album, Weiland added, [...] "I'm proud of everything we've written.

500|$|Traditional {{sources of}} Athletic Association income, {{primarily}} ticket sales, had declined {{as a result}} of both the Yellow Jackets' poor record and the relatively recent establishment of professional football in Atlanta, namely the Atlanta Falcons. Bobby Dodd, then athletic director, had warned <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> Georgia Tech's rising academic standards and its limited curriculum would affect the athletic program. At a meeting on January 8, 1972, the Athletic Association board, led by Boyd, ignored a 42-page list of [...] "charges" [...] drafted by an alumnus, but nevertheless voted to not renew Carson's contract, making him the first Georgia Tech coach to be fired. The board also voted to not accept Bobby Dodd's resignation, which had been offered at the meeting. Carson went on to have a successful career, particularly with the Pittsburgh Steelers. On January 21, 1972, Boyd announced that Bill Fulcher had been selected as the new football head coach. This would not change the Georgia Tech Athletic Association's fortunes, however; after Carson's departure, the on-field and financial problems remained.|$|E

500|$|It was now common {{knowledge}} that Edward was dying.

As late as 12 June, though, he still knew nothing specific, despite having inside information about Edward's sickness. France, which found {{the prospect of the}} Emperor's cousin on the English throne disagreeable, gave indications of support to Northumberland. Since the Duke did not rule out an armed intervention from Charles V, he came back on the French offer after the King's death, sending a secret and non-committal mission to King Henry II. After Jane's accession in July the ambassadors of both powers were convinced she would prevail, although they were in no doubt that the common people backed Mary. Antoine de Noailles wrote of Guildford Dudley as [...] "the new King", while the Emperor instructed his envoys to arrange themselves with the Duke and to discourage Mary from undertaking anything dangerous.|$|E

[...] With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting {{the same role}} over an extended period, it became {{impossible for him to}} separate Ziggy Stardust—and, later, the Thin White Duke—from his own character offstage. Ziggy, Bowie said, [...] "wouldn't leave me alone <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> <b>That</b> was when it all started to go sour... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity." [...] His later Ziggy shows, which included songs from both Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane, were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping down to a sumo wrestling loincloth or simulating oral sex with Ronson's guitar. Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on-stage [...] "retirement" [...] at London's Hammersmith Odeon on 3 July 1973. Footage from the final show was released the same year for the film Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.|$|E

[...] The original script featured various flashback sequences to the actors Peter Donat, William B. Davis and Veronica Cartwright, all from scenes around twenty-to-thirty years earlier in the show.

However, the writers eventually {{came to the conclusion that}} it [...] "just didn't [...] work", so they cut out most of that storyline, which ultimately led to the creation of a whole new direction in which the Cigarette Smoking Man provided a monologue explaining the history of the project instead.
