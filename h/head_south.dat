5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 7 was legislated onto its current alignment, with the {{northern}} terminus moved to the Nutley/Clifton border. The route was also realigned to <b>head</b> <b>south</b> on Washington Avenue between the Newark border and Rutgers Street in Belleville on what was Route 11N, a remnant of Pre-1927 Route 11, making Route 7 discontinuous. County Route 506 used to follow the southern portion of Route 7 but has been truncated to the intersection with Routes 7 and 21 in Belleville.|$|E
5|$|Upon his release, Morris {{returned}} to Peekskill where {{he discovered that}} he had been promoted to the rank of captain while in the custody of the British. Morris commanded a company back to White Plains until he received orders to <b>head</b> <b>south</b> to Virginia. Upon arrival, Morris's company, under the overall command of General George Washington, aided in Siege of Yorktown, the last major battle of the American Revolution. Specifically, Morris's company of light infantry provided support to the forlorn hope commanded by Colonel Alexander Hamilton.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{all of the}} 400 North Atlantic {{right whales}} live in the western North Atlantic Ocean. In {{northern}} spring, summer and autumn, they feed in areas off the Canadian and northeast U.S. coasts in a range stretching from New York to Newfoundland. Particularly popular feeding areas are the Bay of Fundy and Cape Cod Bay. In winter, they <b>head</b> <b>south</b> towards Georgia and Florida to give birth. There have been a smattering of sightings further east {{over the past few}} decades; several sightings were made close to Iceland in 2003. These are possibly the remains of a virtually extinct eastern Atlantic stock, but examination of old whalers' records suggests {{they are more likely to}} be strays. However, a few sightings are regular between Norway, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, the Canary Islands and even Italy and Sicily; at least the Norway individuals come from the Western stock.|$|E
5|$|At {{morning they}} find that three cairns have been built around their tent during the night, which unnerves them. As they continue, Heather realizes her map is missing and Mike later reveals he kicked it into a creek the {{previous}} day out of frustration, which prompts Heather and Josh to attack him in a rage. They realize they are now lost and decide simply to <b>head</b> <b>south.</b> They eventually reach a section where they discover a multitude of humanoid stick figures suspended from trees. That night, they hear sounds again, including the sound of children laughing among other strange noises. After an unknown force shakes the tent, they flee in panic and hide in the woods until dawn.|$|E
5|$|During migration, {{the song}} thrush travels mainly {{at night with}} a strong and direct flight action. It flies in loose flocks which cross the sea on a broad front rather than concentrating at short {{crossings}} (as occurs in the migration of large soaring birds), and calls frequently to maintain contact. Migration may start as early as late August in the most easterly and northerly parts of the range, {{but the majority of}} birds, with shorter distances to cover, <b>head</b> <b>south</b> from September to mid-December. However, hard weather may force further movement. Return migration varies between mid-February around the Mediterranean to May in northern Sweden and central Siberia. Vagrants have been recorded in Greenland, various Atlantic islands, and West Africa.|$|E

5|$|East of Lewiston village, NY104 follows Ridge Road {{through a}} sparsely {{populated}} area of Niagara County. Much of this portion of NY104 is bordered on its southern end by the Tuscarora Indian Reservation. At the Lewiston hamlet of Dickersonville, the extents of the reservation <b>head</b> <b>south,</b> and development along NY104 increases slightly. NY104 meets the northern terminus of NY429 at the Lewiston–Cambria town line and crosses over NY425 at Streeters Corners. Just east of this location is an intersection with NY93 {{in the community of}} Molyneaux Corners. The two routes form a concurrency east to Warrens Corners, a hamlet on the Cambria–Lockport town line, where NY93 turns south to serve the city of Lockport.|$|E
5|$|From Illawarra Junction, four tracks <b>head</b> <b>south</b> through Erskineville and St Peters to Sydenham station. The 'main' pair {{of tracks}} {{are used by}} Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line and South Coast Line trains and the 'local' pair by Bankstown Line and peak hour Airport, Inner West & South Line trains. At Sydenham, the Bankstown railway line {{branches}} off, but trains from the Airport, Inner West & South Line continue along the Illawarra line until Wolli Creek, where a junction to the East Hills line exists. South of Wolli Creek station, a crossover allows trains from the 'main' pair of tracks to switch to the 'local' pair. This is used by peak hour all-stations Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line trains. The four track section ends at Hurstville. The line then continues as two tracks south towards Sutherland, crossing the Georges River via the Como railway bridge between Oatley and Como. At Sutherland the Cronulla line branches in an easterly direction.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, PA 232 was {{designated}} between PA 532 in Northeast Philadelphia and PA 32 in New Hope, following Welsh Road to PA 63 in Bethayres before turning north along its current alignment to PA 113 (now PA 413), where it headed northwest concurrent with PA 113 to Pineville and turned northeast onto Pine Lane before picking up its current alignment to New Hope. The present-day route from PA 63 south to PA 73 in Philadelphia {{was designated}} as PA 163. PA 232 was rerouted to <b>head</b> <b>south</b> and replace PA 163 between Bethayres and Philadelphia in 1937. The same year, PA 232 was rerouted to bypass Pineville to the east. The route was extended further south down Oxford Avenue to the Oxford Circle by 1960. Since then, {{there have been}} no alignment changes to PA 232.|$|E

5|$|Jon Snow, {{having just}} {{resigned}} from the Night's Watch, is disillusioned by the betrayal of his fellow Night's Watchmen and tired {{of all of the}} endless fighting. Jon states his intent to <b>head</b> <b>south,</b> but Edd is unhappy with Jon's decision after seeing what had happened at Hardhome. They are interrupted by the lookout's horn as Sansa Stark, Brienne of Tarth, and Podrick Payne arrive at Castle Black and Sansa is reunited with Jon. After telling each other their stories, Sansa tries to convince Jon to help her retake Winterfell. However, Jon is still reluctant to fight. Frustrated, Sansa declares to Jon that she will take back Winterfell whether he helps her or not.|$|E
5|$|MD150 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US40 (Pulaski Highway) in East Baltimore. The route heads south as Haven Street, a four-lane undivided street that passes through an industrial area. East of the Highlandtown neighborhood, MD150 turns east onto Lombard Street, which crosses over three rail spurs that <b>head</b> <b>south</b> to Canton; one line splits from CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision, {{while the other}} two spring from the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and are operated by Norfolk Southern Railway. The state highway's run on Lombard Street ends at Ponca Street; Lombard Street continues east toward ramps to northbound I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) and Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. MD150 turns south onto Ponca Street, a four-lane divided highway that has a ramp to southbound I-895 toward the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel. The highway follows Ponca Street to the Greektown neighborhood, where MD150 turns east onto Eastern Avenue and immediately crosses over I-895.|$|E
5|$|New York City {{initially}} did not mark numbered routes {{within its}} limits. In 1932, the New York Automobile Club drafted a plan establishing alignments for several routes through the city. In this plan, NY9A went south through the Bronx and into Manhattan on Broadway while US9 used Riverdale Avenue north of 230th Street. As a result, the two routes {{would have had}} a short concurrency across Spuyten Duyvil Creek. NY9A would have split to the south on Tenth Avenue at 218th Street in order to join the Harlem River Drive via Nagle Avenue and Dyckman Street. From there it would head west on 155th Street to Amsterdam Avenue, where it would <b>head</b> <b>south</b> to 79th Street, heading west there to rejoin US9 at Riverside Drive. US9 would have continued south through lower Manhattan to Staten Island via the Staten Island Ferry; however, it is unclear whether NY9A would have continued south with US9 to lower Manhattan.|$|E

5|$|New Zealands first wartime {{action was}} the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914, {{as part of}} the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral David Beatty. Beatty's ships were {{originally}} intended to provide distant support for the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast, in case large units of the High Seas Fleet sortied in response to the British attacks once the tide rose. When the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule at 11:35a.m., the battlecruisers, led by Beatty aboard his flagship, , began to <b>head</b> <b>south</b> at full speed to reinforce the smaller British ships; the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the sandbar {{at the mouth of the}} Jade estuary.|$|E
5|$|On August 9, fifteen Texas Rangers {{with their}} Indian scouts, located Victorio's main supply camp on Sierra Diablo. The Rangers joined Carpenter {{in the attack}} while Nolan guarded Sulfur Springs. Carpenter's attack {{scattered}} the Indian guards while the troopers secured 25 head of cattle, provisions and several pack animals. Victorio under increasing pressure, short of food and more importantly water, began to <b>head</b> <b>south</b> in two main groups. By August 11, Carpenter was on the trail in pursuit but, with horses tired and thirsty from the campaign, the chase was slow. Carpenter divided his command, with Nolan with his company and Texas Rangers on one route, while he took {{the rest of the}} command on another route. On August 13, Nolan reached the Rio Grande where Indian scouts reported that Victorio had crossed the border into Mexico the evening before. Carpenter arrived later and ordered the cavalrymen to rest near the river.|$|E
5|$|The Grorud and Furuset Line head {{northeast}} into Groruddalen, {{while the}} other two eastern branches <b>head</b> <b>south</b> into Nordstrand. On the west side, the Holmenkoll and Sognsvann Line cover the northern boroughs of Oslo, along with the Ring Line that connects the northeastern and northwestern parts of town. The Kolsås and Røa Line reach deep into the neighbouring municipality of Bærum. All the lines run through the Common Tunnel before reaching out to different lines, or into the Ring. All lines have a base service of four trains per hour while line 2 and the eastern section of line 3 have eight trains per hour weekdays 7–19. The eastern section of line 2 also has eight trains per hour Saturdays 10–19. A reduced half-hourly service operates on all lines during early weekend mornings. Trains run from about 05:00 (06:00 at weekends) to 01:00 the next morning.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle is}} {{followed}} by the Welshmen destroying the pagan temples while the Aztecs gather to appoint a new king. Games and events are established and follow after the battle. During the various events, a temple becomes covered in flames and idols to the pagan gods appear once again. This {{is followed by}} the Aztecs telling the Welsh to leave before attacking them. A battle takes place in the water surrounding the Aztec city on boats, and the superior Welsh ships are able to win. The Aztecs, unwilling to stop, turn to superstitious rituals and priests travel to a sacred mountain to make sacrifices. However, a sudden lava eruption kills the priests. This causes the Aztecs to believe {{that they do not have}} the support of their gods and they cease their fighting. Admitting defeat, the Aztecs leave the area and <b>head</b> <b>south</b> for Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The {{constant}} Dutch attacks led Sudirman, {{perhaps at}} the suggestion of one of his men, to change his clothes and give his old outfit to one of his soldiers, Second Lieutenant Heru Kesser– who bore a resemblance to Sudirman. Kesser was ordered to <b>head</b> <b>south</b> with a large company of soldiers, remove the clothes, and furtively return north, while Sudirman waited in Karangnongko. The diversion was successful, and on 27December Sudirman and his men made their way to Jambu Village. Arriving on 9January 1949, Sudirman met with several government ministers who had not been present during the Dutch attack on Yogyakarta: Supeno, Susanto Tirtoprojo, and Susilowati. With the politicians, Sudirman made his way to Banyutuwo, ordering some of his soldiers to linger back and hold off Dutch ground troops. In Banyutuwo, they held for over a week. However, on 21January, when Dutch forces approached the village, Sudirman and his entourage were forced to leave, fighting their way out in heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|The {{first several}} miles of NY149 in Washington County pass through isolated, {{rural areas as}} it curves {{to the north and}} south while {{following}} a generally east–west alignment. In West Fort Ann, the only community along the route between the county line and the village of Fort Ann, NY149 intersects with Old State Route149, a loop route of NY149 that was created when the highway was realigned. The route continues east from the community, exiting Adirondack Park and crossing over Halfway Creek on its way into the village of Fort Ann, where it becomes Ann Street. Within the village, NY149 passes the Fort Ann Cemetery and two blocks of homes before intersecting with US4 at George Street. NY149 turns to the south, joining US4 along George Street through downtown Fort Ann. After passing the town park, US4 and NY149 leave the village and become nameless as they <b>head</b> <b>south</b> into the town of Kingsbury.|$|E
