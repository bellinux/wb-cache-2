5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of <b>equal</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede is {{composed}} of approximately <b>equal</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> silicate rock and water ice. It is a fully differentiated body with an iron-rich, liquid core, and an internal ocean that may contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. Its surface {{is composed}} of two main types of terrain. Dark regions, saturated with impact craters and dated to four billion years ago, cover {{about a third of}} the satellite. Lighter regions, crosscut by extensive grooves and ridges and only slightly less ancient, cover the remainder. The cause of the light terrain's disrupted geology is not fully known, but was likely the result of tectonic activity due to tidal heating.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that Oberon formed from the {{accretion}} disk that surrounded Uranus just after the planet's formation. The moon consists of approximately <b>equal</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> ice and rock, and is probably differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water may be present at {{the boundary between the}} mantle and the core. The surface of Oberon, which is dark and slightly red in color, appears to have been primarily shaped by asteroid and comet impacts. It is covered by numerous impact craters reaching 210km in diameter. Oberon possesses a system of chasmata (graben or scarps) formed during crustal extension {{as a result of the}} expansion of its interior during its early evolution.|$|E

5|$|After {{her return}} to Japan, Hōshō was {{transferred}} to the Third Fleet, unofficially assigned to the training fleet (later called the Mobile Force Training Force), and officially assigned in October. She conducted flight training in the Inland Sea for aircraft that flew in from shore bases, since no aircraft were based on board Hōshō. On 15 January 1943, the 50th Air Flotilla was created for carrier aircrew training and both Hōshō and Ryūhō were assigned to the new unit. The two ships provided carrier landing training and served as target ships for torpedo training. In January 1944, Hōshō was reassigned to the 12th Air Fleet, then to the Combined Fleet, but continued to perform the same mission of training fleet carrier pilots in the Inland Sea. In this role, Hōshō shuttled back and forth between Kure and the Western Inland Sea, spending <b>equal</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> time at each location.|$|E
5|$|Callisto (Jupiter IV) is {{the fourth}} and last Galilean moon, and is the second largest of the four, and at 4820.6 {{kilometers}} in diameter, it is the third largest moon in the Solar System, and barely smaller than Mercury, though {{only a third of}} the latter's mass. It is named after the Greek mythological nymph Callisto, a lover of Zeus who was a daughter of the Arkadian King Lykaon and a hunting companion of the goddess Artemis. The moon does not form part of the orbital resonance that affects three inner Galilean satellites and thus does not experience appreciable tidal heating. Callisto is composed of approximately <b>equal</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> rock and ices, which makes it the least dense of the Galilean moons. It {{is one of the most}} heavily cratered satellites in the Solar System, and one major feature is a basin around 3000km wide called Valhalla.|$|E

25|$|Modern International Morse code (generally {{believed}} to have been developed by Alfred Vail based on English-language letter frequencies of the 1830s) encodes the most frequent letters with the shortest symbols; arranging the Morse alphabet into groups of letters that require <b>equal</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> time to transmit, and then sorting these groups in increasing order, yields e it san hurdm wgvlfbk opxcz jyq.

25|$|The Dirac equation, {{formulated}} by Paul Dirac around 1928 {{as part of}} the development of relativistic quantum mechanics, predicts the existence of antiparticles along with the expected solutions for the corresponding particles. Since then, experiments have verified that every known kind of particle has a corresponding antiparticle. Under the CPT theorem, a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass and lifetime, and opposite charge. Given this symmetry, it is puzzling that the universe does not have <b>equal</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> matter and antimatter. Indeed, there is no experimental evidence that there are any significant concentrations of antimatter in the observable universe.|$|E

25|$|When an {{arbitrary}} {{beam of light}} strikes {{the surface of a}} birefringent material, the polarizations corresponding to the ordinary and extraordinary rays generally take somewhat different paths. Unpolarized light consists of <b>equal</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> energy in any two orthogonal polarizations, and even polarized light (except in special cases) will have some energy in each of these polarizations. According to Snell's law of refraction, the angle of refraction will be governed by the effective refractive index which is different between these two polarizations. This is clearly seen, for instance, in the Wollaston prism which is designed to separate incoming light into two linear polarizations using a birefringent material such as calcite.|$|E
25|$|The main {{activity}} in co-counselling involves participants arranging to meet regularly in pairs {{to give each}} other peer-to-peer counselling, in turn taking the role of counsellor and client, with <b>equal</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> time allocated to each. Co-counselling functions by giving people an opportunity to work on whatever issues they choose with the accepting support of another person, with whom they have no actual relationship. The person {{in the role of}} counsellor acts as a facilitator to the client, sometimes as a third-party observer and sometimes as a second-party confidant. While co-counselling is sometimes practiced outside a formal organisation, formal co-counselling organisations have developed leadership and support structures, including trainings and retreats.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} game, the player could {{choose one of}} three races; Romans, Egyptians and Asians. Quest of the Amazons added the Amazons as a fourth race. Unlike in previous Settlers titles, each race has a slightly different economic model. For example, the Romans' and Amazons' construction industries require roughly <b>equal</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> wood and stone, the Egyptians' requires more stone than wood, and the Asians' more wood than stone. Each race also has specific skills; for example, only the Romans can turn wood into coal; only the Egyptians can build on desert terrain; only the Asians can mine sulfur; and only the Amazons can build war machines which use manna rather than physical ammunition.|$|E
