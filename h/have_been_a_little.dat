A surface circulation redeveloped in the northern portion of the remnants of Erin, and the system developed into a tropical depression again late on September 6 while located 365miles (585km) north-northwest of where it previously dissipated. The depression moved to the north-northeast, {{then turned to the}} north-northwest, and regained tropical storm status on September 7. Erin steadily intensified, and its convection and cloud pattern became much better organized on September 8. On September 9 Erin intensified into a hurricane while located 275miles (440km), and a 40mile (65km) wide eye developed. Erin quickly strengthened on September 9 to reach a peak intensity of 120mph (195km/h)., however some sources claim that Erin may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> stronger.|$|E

[...] The unconventional arrangement bred frustration and the 7th/13th constantly harped about the use of its air assets in northern Laos. There was constant criticism over the use of air power [...] "serving targets" [...] or utilizing modern fighter-bombers as [...] "long-range artillery."

[...] He argued that the episode was [...] "so effective" [...] because it [...] "isn't just the inversion of the monster/normal personal dichotomy; the show has pulled that trick before, and while it tries to play coy about {{the true nature of}} the soul eater at first, it's not hard to recognize who the real villain is." [...] Handlen also wrote that the episode both [...] "forces the audience to identify more strongly with Doggett" [...] and made good use of Anderson's absence. Meghan Deans of Tor.com felt that, while [...] "the tale of the soul eater may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> rushed and a little sloppy", the episode itself [...] "has a spark to it [...] spark of the absent, the drive of the missing.

500|$|Virginia was {{described}} as having dark hair and violet eyes, with skin so pale it was called [...] "pure white", causing a [...] "bad complexion that spoiled her looks".

Another visitor in Fordham wrote, [...] "Mrs. Poe looked very young; she had large black eyes, and a pearly whiteness of complexion, which was a perfect pallor. Her pale face, her brilliant eyes, and her raven hair gave her an unearthly look." [...] That unearthly look was mentioned by others who suggested it made her look not quite human. William Gowans, who once lodged with the family, described Virginia as a woman of [...] "matchless beauty and loveliness, her eye could match that of any houri, and her face defy the genius of a Canova to imitate". She might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> plump. Many contemporary accounts as well as modern biographers remark on her childlike appearance even {{in the last years}} of her life.|$|E

Benigno noted that Sugar was also being bullied—by Santana—and wrote that he was [...] "not a fan" [...] of this [...] "on a show that supposedly glorifies outcasts and promotes their successes". Santana came in for praise from Kubicek, along with Brittany, for their [...] "fantastic date" [...] and their relationship which is [...] "the most interesting one on the show".

It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so it might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being {{in the same room with}} each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Television critics reacted mostly {{positive}} {{toward the}} episode, calling the storyline [...] "heartfelt."

[...] Kaiser went on to compliment series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, stating [...] "some of the more recent formal experiments that the show has done, such as the hour-long murder mystery in this season's premiere, indicate that MacFarlane and company agree with the criticism." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "I have to give props to Family Guy for going outside their wheelhouse without winking excessively at their audience, but I think it may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit too far to be truly great." [...] Kaiser ultimately gave the episode a B rating, the best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'" [...] and The Simpsons episode [...] "Moms I'd Like to Forget". In another positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's [...] "funniest moments," [...] which included the opening sequence involving Peter and the Red Bull, as well as the reference to The Price Is Right. Hughes went on to comment that the episode [...] "taught us about the depths and bonds of love that make a family. Whether it's acceptance, hope or sacrifice, there's no limit to what we will do for family." [...] Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also commented positively on the episode, writing in her review of the storyline, [...] "Overall, I found the installment to be refreshing with everyone taking a part in Peter’s dilemma. It was actually sweet and emotional for a change." [...] Moon also praised the scenes involving President Obama, and Stewie's attempt at saving Brian.|$|E
