5|$|Doug Wickenheiser was {{selected}} by Montreal with the <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> at the 1980 NHL Entry Draft.

5|$|The Houston Astros chose Nevin {{with the}} first overall pick in the 1992 Major League Baseball draft. Hal Newhouser, a scout for the Astros, had {{evaluated}} Derek Jeter extensively prior to the draft. Convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team, Newhouser lobbied team management to select Jeter, and quit in protest over the Astros' decision to take Nevin instead. The Astros believed that Jeter would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract. Signing bonuses given to {{the best player in}} the draft were increasing rapidly. Todd Van Poppel, regarded by many at the time the <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> of the 1990 MLB draft, signed for $1.2 million, while the 1991 MLB draft's <b>first</b> <b>pick,</b> Brien Taylor, signed for $1.55 million after insisting he would otherwise enroll in college. Meanwhile, the Astros were unable to sign their first-round draft pick in 1991, John Burke, who insisted on a bonus of $500,000 as the sixth overall selection. Consequently, the Astros passed on Jeter in the draft.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} Cleveland Cavaliers and Buffalo Braves (now Los Angeles Clippers), the Trail Blazers entered the NBA in 1970 as an {{expansion}} team, under coach Rolland Todd. Geoff Petrie and Sidney Wicks {{led the team}} in its early years, and the team failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs in its first six seasons of existence. During that span, the team had three head coaches (including future hall-of-famer Lenny Wilkens); team executive Stu Inman also served as coach. The team won the <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> in the NBA draft twice during that span. In 1972, the team drafted LaRue Martin with the number one pick, and in 1974 the team selected Bill Walton from UCLA.|$|E
