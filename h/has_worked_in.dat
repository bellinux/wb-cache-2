5|$|Since 1969, the Hyatt plant <b>has</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> {{tandem with}} an {{extensive}} pumped-storage operation comprising two offstream reservoirs west of Oroville. These two facilities are collectively {{known as the}} Oroville-Thermalito Complex. Water is diverted into the upper Thermalito reservoir (Thermalito Forebay) via the Thermalito Diversion Dam on the Feather River. During periods of off-peak power use, surplus energy generated at Hyatt is used to lift water from Thermalito's lower reservoir (the Thermalito Afterbay) to the forebay, which releases water back into the afterbay to generate up to 114 MW of power at times of high demand. The Hyatt and Thermalito plants produce an average of 2.2 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity each year, {{about half of the}} total power produced by the SWP's eight hydroelectric facilities.|$|E

Flight370 was a scheduled commercial flight with 227 passengers and 12 crew which departed Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia at 0:41 and was scheduled to land in Beijing, China at 6:30China Standard Time (6:30MYT; 22:30UTC, 7 March).
