6000|$|It was {{not without}} some emotion that he looked upon the scene around him, for, {{in spite of his}} secluded life, he knew enough of the ancient greatness of his own family to be aware that the time had been when they had held undisputed and {{paramount}} sway over all that tract of country. His father could trace his pure Saxon lineage back to that Godfrey Malf who had held the manors of Bisterne and of Minstead at the time when the Norman first set mailed foot upon English soil. The afforestation of the district, however, and its conversion into a royal demesne had clipped off a large section of his estate, while other parts had been confiscated as a punishment for his supposed complicity in an abortive Saxon rising. The fate of the ancestor had been typical of that of his descendants. During three hundred years their domains had gradually contracted, sometimes through royal or feudal encroachment, and sometimes through such gifts to the Church as that with which Alleyne's father had opened the doors of Beaulieu Abbey to his younger son. The importance of the family had thus dwindled, but they still retained the old Saxon manor-house, with a couple of farms and a grove large enough to afford pannage to a hundred pigs--"sylva de centum porcis," [...] as the old family parchments describe it. Above all, the owner of the soil could still hold his head high as the veritable Socman of Minstead--that is, as holding the land in <b>free</b> <b>socage,</b> with no feudal superior, and answerable to no man lower than the king. Knowing this, Alleyne felt some little glow of worldly pride as he looked for the first time upon the land with which so many generations of his ancestors had been associated. He pushed on the quicker, twirling his staff merrily, and looking out at every turn of the path for some sign of the old Saxon residence. He was suddenly arrested, however, by the appearance of a wild-looking fellow armed with a club, who sprang out from behind a tree and barred his passage. He was a rough, powerful peasant, with cap and tunic of untanned sheepskin, leather breeches, and galligaskins round legs and feet.|$|E
50|$|Land {{was subject}} to feudal tenure and could be held in allod or fief, the latter coming in two {{distinct}} forms—either <b>free</b> <b>socage</b> (seigneurie) or villein socage (roture). <b>Free</b> <b>socage</b> was considered 'noble' (but the owner {{did not have to}} be a member of the nobility) and the latter 'peasant'.|$|E
50|$|The {{other half}} would be split evenly among the {{surviving}} children. Children {{were entitled to}} a legitime, whether they were male or female, and could access their inheritances at 25, the legal age of majority. They could not be disinherited. Estates in <b>free</b> <b>socage</b> (seigneuries) were subject to different rules of inheritance, and estates in villein socage had to be partitioned equally. A <b>free</b> <b>socage</b> was inherited unequally with half going to the eldest son and the rest being divided equally among his siblings.|$|E
5000|$|The {{feudal system}} in England {{gradually}} {{became more and}} more complex until eventually the process became cumbrous and services difficult to enforce. As a result, the statute of Quia Emptores was passed in 1290 to replace subinfeudation with substitution, so the subordinate tenant transferred their tenure rather than creating a new subordinate tenure. As tenancies came to an end, the number of layers in the feudal pyramid was reduced. The Tenures Abolition Act 1660 abolished knight service, converting all <b>free</b> tenures to <b>socage</b> tenure.|$|R
50|$|In {{the reign}} of Elizabeth the Fraudulent Conveyances Act 1571 and 1584 avoided {{fraudulent}} conveyances as against all parties and voluntary conveyances as against subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration. Early in {{the reign of}} Charles II the Tenures Abolition Act 1660 turned most feudal tenures into tenure by <b>free</b> and common <b>socage</b> and abolished the feudal incidents. The Statute of Frauds contained provisions that certain leases and assignments, and that all agreements and trusts relating to land, should be in writing. The land registries of Middlesex and Yorkshire date from the reign of Anne. Devises (gifts by will) of land for charitable purposes were forbidden by the Charitable Uses Act of 1735. In the next reign the first general Inclosure Act, the Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801, was passed. In the reign of William IV fines and recoveries were abolished and simpler modes of conveyance substituted, {{and the laws of}} inheritance and dower were amended.|$|R
5000|$|Higgs died {{unmarried}} at South Stoke on 16 December 1659 and {{was buried}} in the chancel of the church. According to his will dated 22 Aug 1659, he allotted funds to the church of South Stoke, some specified to buy land for the poor of that town. He also donated funds to purchase <b>free</b> land of <b>socage</b> for the maintenance of a schoolmaster there, which was to be managed by the warden and fellows of Merton College, who were appointed patrons of the school to be erected at South Stoke. He left funds for the purchase of divinity books for the Bodleian Library, St. Merton's and St. John's College. His library, which had been scattered during the war, the greatest portion being kept at Stafford, he left to Merton College but the corporation of Stafford successfully resisted the attempts of the college to obtain the books [...] Higgs likewise gave money to found a divinity lecture at Merton College and an annual sum to augment the allowance of the postmasters.|$|R

5000|$|On 12 May 1555 he {{was granted}} by Queen Mary a 30-year lease (in <b>free</b> <b>socage</b> for a rent of £29 3s per annum) of the escheated manor and lordship of Great Torrington, caput of a feudal barony, in North Devon.

40|$|It seems {{a shameful}} thing to confess that {{the quest for}} 2 ̆ 2 tenure 2 ̆ 2 {{of land in the}} American States, so busily carried on in modem times, reminds one of the childish game, 2 ̆ 2 Button, button, who has the button ? 2 ̆ 2 It {{certainly}} appears disrespectful to such an ancient and honorable institution as English land tenure, to associate it with so silly a game. Yet is there not a resemblance? Lands in Colonial America were undoubtedly granted by the English Crown to be held in <b>free</b> and common <b>socage,</b> 2 ̆ 2 as of our Manor at East-Greenwich, in the County of Kent, 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 or, as in the patent given by Charles II to William Penn, 2 ̆ 2 to bee holden of Us Our heires and Successors, Kings of England, as of Our Castle of Windsor in Our County of Berks, in <b>free</b> and comon <b>Socage,</b> by fealty only for all Services, and not in Capite or by Knights Service: Yielding and paying therefore to Us, Our heires and Successors, Two Beaver Skins [...] . 2 ̆ 2 Unquestionably there was land tenure in Colonial lands, even though of the mild and somewhat defeudalized type possible after the statute of 12 Car. II, c. 24. Then what has become of it? Look about as you may, you will see none of the familiar signs of English land tenure; no doing of homage, no swearing of fealty, no reliefs, no rent service or distress in case of grants in fee (except in Pennsylvania), no escheat to the original grantor, even though such grantor be the Federal government, but only to the State in which the land lies. There appears to be no tenure at all. Then who has the button? What can have become of that Colonial tenure, which was so very real and active as to keep the colonists in unceasing conflict and turmoil with the royal governors, or unhappy proprietaries, who attempted {{to take advantage of it}} and enforce the rendering of services reserved, here nearly always taking the form of quit rents, and which did so much to bring on the Revolution? The answer has puzzled our scholars and judges. Professor Gray thought it not probable that so 2 ̆ 2 fundamental an alteration in the theory of property as the abolition of tenure would be worked by a change of political sovereignty...|$|R
5000|$|An English barony is a peerage (yet the {{abolition}} act of 1660 allows for some remaining non-peer baronies not converted by writ {{to remain as}} feudal baronies of <b>free</b> <b>socage</b> [...] "incorporeal hereditament" [...] similar to a lordship of the manor), but whether Scottish barons rightfully rank as peers is disputable. [...] They are known as minor barons currently treated as noble titles of less than peerage rank. The Scottish equivalent of an English baron is [...] "Lord of Parliament".|$|E
5000|$|Under the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, many baronies by tenure were {{converted}} into baronies by writ. The rest {{ceased to exist}} as feudal baronies by tenure, becoming baronies in <b>free</b> <b>socage,</b> {{that is to say}} under a [...] "free" [...] (hereditable) contract requiring payment of monetary rents. Thus baronies could no longer be held by military service. Parliamentary titles of honour had been limited since the 15th century by the Modus Tenenda Parliamenta act, and could thenceforth only be created by writ of summons or letters patent.|$|E
50|$|Estates in <b>free</b> <b>socage</b> {{were the}} most macro-level of land {{division}} in New France but, within them, there existed several tenurial subdivisions. Immediately {{below the level of}} <b>free</b> <b>socage</b> was that of the villeinage (roture). Throughout New France, there came to exist several thousand estates in villeinage. Furthermore, these villein tenancies were remarkably uniform in terms of size. Barring extreme cases, it is estimated that around 95% of all villein estates were between 40 and 200 square arpents, or (7,680' ft and 38,400' ft) in size, though most were likely 120 arpents or less. Estates of less than 40 square arpents were considered to be of little value by villein socagers.To maximize simplicity when surveying, estates in villein socage were almost invariably distributed in rectangular plots following a rowed system wherein the first row bordered the river, and was the first to be filled, followed by the second behind it and so on. Typically, the proportions of such rectangles coincided with the ratio of 1:10 for width and length, respectively. However, extremes {{all the way up to}} 1:100 are known to have occurred. This method of land division confers obvious advantages in terms of easy access to transportation and cheap surveying, but also allowed socagers to live remarkably close to families on neighboring plots—often within a few hundred yards—creating something of a proto-neighborhood.|$|E
5000|$|Since the {{adoption}} of summons by writ, baronies thus no longer relate directly to land-holding, and thus no more feudal baronies needed thenceforth to be created. Following the Modus Tenendi Parliamenta of 1419, the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, the Feudal Tenure Act (1662), and the Fines and Recoveries Act of 1834, titles of feudal barony became obsolete and without legal force. The Abolition Act 1660 specifically states: baronies by tenure were converted into baronies by writ. The rest ceased to exist as feudal baronies by tenure, becoming baronies in <b>free</b> <b>socage,</b> {{that is to say}} under a [...] "free" [...] (hereditable) contract requiring payment of monetary rents.|$|E
50|$|Josceline le Deneys (whose {{first name}} was Latinised to Jollenus, Jellanus or Joscelinus) was {{recorded}} in the 1166 Cartae Baronum return submitted by Henry de Pomeroy, feudal baron of Berry Pomeroy in South Devon, as holding from him the manor of Pancrasweek, Black Torrington hundred, North Devon, and de Pomeroy himself held it from Tavistock Abbey. This Jollenus Dacus held Pancrasweek as one knight's fee on military feudal tenure. Orleigh formed a sub-manor of Pancrasweek, but was held by him under the non-military tenure of <b>free</b> <b>socage,</b> {{that is to say}} it was a heritable estate the service for which was monetary not military. Dacus held two fees in total from de Pomeroy, as stated in his 1166 return.|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{attainder}} of the Marquis of Exeter the Courtenay lands escheated to the Crown, {{and those}} within Colyton were sold back for £1,000 to various residents of Colyton parish, as listed in a deed transcribed in the Letters and Papers of Henry VIII dated 6 January 1547, summarised as [...] "John Clarke and others. Grant in <b>free</b> <b>socage,</b> subject to rents etc. (specified), for l,000l., {{of the following}} lands (extents given) in the parish of Colyton, which are parcels of Colyton manor, Devon, and belonged to Henry Marquis of Exeter, attainted". [...] This was {{the origin of the}} Feoffees of Colyton, who continued to hold in common various properties in the parish.|$|E
50|$|Under feudal tenure, a fief {{could not}} be owned {{outright}} but was instead divided into competing interests known as estates in land; thus, a single tract of land could be held both in villein socage by a tenant and in <b>free</b> <b>socage</b> by {{the lord of the}} manor. Villein socage was subject to a number of real burdens and feudal incidents owed to the manorial landlord. For example, the Custom provided for the payment of an annual feu-duty (the cens) by villein socagers to the landlord as both revenue and as a token of submission. The entry fine (lods et ventes) was another mandatory payment, a conveyance fee for villein socages and amounting to a twelfth of the sales price, and derived from the feu-duty, as were other fees and the right of laudatio (retrait lignager).|$|E
5000|$|Feudal {{land tenure}} existed in many varieties. The sole {{surviving}} {{form in the}} United States is that species of freehold known as <b>free</b> <b>socage.</b> Here the service to be performed is known and fixed, and not of a base or servile nature; the [...] "lord of the fee" [...] is the State itself, and the service due to this [...] "lord" [...] is payment of the taxes upon the real estate. The major consequences, in the modern world, of this feudal approach, as distinguished from ownership, are, first, the forfeiture of the tenement upon failure to perform the service (that is, non-payment of taxes), and second, the doctrine of eminent domain, whereby the [...] "lord of the fee" [...] might take back the estate, provided he make just compensation. Also existing in a vestigial form {{is the concept of}} escheat, under which an estate of a holder without heirs returns to the ownership of the state.|$|E
5000|$|Royal {{charters}} {{granted to}} English colonists in North America, often used {{the name of}} the manor of East Greenwich for describing the tenure (from the Latin verb teneo, hold) as that of <b>free</b> <b>socage.</b> New England charters provided that the grantees should hold their lands [...] "as of his Majesty’s manor of East Greenwich." [...] This was in relation to the principle of land tenure under English law, that the ruling monarch (king or queen) was paramount lord of all the soil in the terra regis, while all others held their lands, directly or indirectly, under the monarch. Land outside the physical boundaries of England, as in America, was treated as belonging constructively to one of the existing royal manors, and from Tudor times grants frequently used {{the name of the}} manor of East Greenwich, but some 17c. grants named the castle of Windsor. Places in North America that have taken the name [...] "East Greenwich" [...] include a township in Gloucester County, New Jersey, a hamlet in Washington County, New York, and a town in Kent County, Rhode Island.|$|E
50|$|Josceline le Deneys (whose {{first name}} was Latinised to Jollenus, Jellanus or Joscelinus) was {{recorded}} in the 1166 Cartae Baronum return submitted by Henry de Pomeroy, feudal baron of Berry Pomeroy in South Devon, as holding from him the manor of Pancrasweek, Black Torrington hundred, North Devon, and de Pomeroy himself held it from Tavistock Abbey.

Dacus held two fees in total from de Pomeroy, as stated in his 1166 return, and the identity of these fees are revealed in the record of the holdings of his descendant Robert le Deneys in the feudal aid of 1285 which shows Pancrasweek forming one, Southwick in Germansweek and Manaton (14 miles north of Berry Pomeroy Castle) forming a half each. In 1285 however Robert le Deneys was holding these manors not from the de Pomeroy barons but from the heirs of Patrick de Chaworth, who was successor in title to Brewer, lord of the manor of Buckland Brewer amongst others, who had himself purchased them from de Pomeroy.|$|E
5000|$|Henry Machyn stated Edward Lewkenor to {{have been}} Groom Porter to King Edward VI, a fact lacking {{positive}} confirmation from other sources. (This office included responsibility for royal games at cards). Thomas Wroth, who was knighted in 1547, was successively Gentleman Usher to the Prince's Chamber (1541-1547), Gentleman of the Privy Chamber (1547-49) and a principal Gentleman (1549-53) to the King: he was also Knight of the Shire for Middlesex in the parliaments of 1547, 1549 and March 1553. Lewknor {{is likely to have}} gained his position in the royal household through his brother-in-law's connections and the influence of Richard Rich. In 1548 Margaret Lewknor was the demesne lessee of the manor of High Barns at Upper Beeding, Sussex, a property seized by the Crown from the attainted Duke of Norfolk, which had been granted to Thomas Seymour in 1547. Following Seymour's attainder in 1549, on 21 May 1553 it, together with the site of the former Bramber Castle and the disparked lands called Le Newe Park at Upper Beeding were granted in chief by the King to Edward Lewknor, King's Servant, Esquire, for the fortieth part of a knight's fee and in consideration of £718.8s.8d paid to Sir Edmund Peckham on behalf of the King. Lewknor was also granted the house of the former Butler Chantry cantarista in Horsham, and several tenements appertaining to it, in <b>free</b> <b>socage.</b> The acquisition of the site at Bramber was no doubt a visible assertion or impropriation of Lewknor's perceived de Braose ancestry or forbears.|$|E
5000|$|The English feudal barony, or [...] "barony by tenure", now has {{no legal}} existence. It {{was the highest}} form of feudal land tenure, namely per baroniam (Latin for [...] "by barony") under which the {{land-holder}} owed the now little understood service of [...] "being one of the king's barons". It must be distinguished from the lesser barony, also feudal, which existed within a county palatine, such as the barony of Halton within the Palatinate of Chester. Such barons were merely tenants-in-chief of a prince, whose own overlord was the king. The duties and privileges owed by feudal barons cannot now be defined exactly but the main duty certainly was the provision of soldiers to the royal feudal army on demand by the king, and a further duty, which involved considerable expense and travel, clearly also a privilege, was the attendance at the king's feudal court, the precursor of Parliament. The principal benefit clearly was the revenue generated from rents and production within the demesne lands of the barony, and also the personal power and prestige derived from the feudal service of the tenants, {{the highest level of}} whom, lords of their own manors, became knights in the baron's retinue. The estate-in-land held by barony if containing a significant castle as its caput and if especially large, that is to say consisting of more than about 20 knight's fees (each loosely equivalent to a manor), was termed an [...] "honour". Constituent manors of a barony were mostly subinfeudated by the baron to his own knights or followers, with a few retained tenantless as his demesne. Most English Feudal Barons were converted to baronies of writ or peerage according to the Abolition Act of 1660. The baronies not converted became baronies of <b>free</b> <b>socage,</b> a dignity title.|$|E
40|$|The Arden area of north-west Warwickshire {{developed}} {{its regional}} personality {{during the early}} Middle Ages {{as the result of}} being by-passed by the main wave of Anglo-Saxon colonisation. From the eleventh to the early fourteenth centuries the area saw a vigorous colonising movement whose character was determined partially by the extent of early settlement, and hence the amount of woodland and waste surviving, and partially by seigniorial policy. This movement differed from the Anglo-Saxon colonisation, which led to the establishment of common open fields, in that clearing was a matter of private initiative and resulted in the creation of enclosed several ties. Manorial lords were compelled to offer some form of inducement to settlers, and this took the form of a less rigid application of the manorial regime, so that the typical tenure of Arden was <b>free</b> <b>socage,</b> and dues were largely rendered in cash. These concessions encouraged the movement of population into the area especially those manors where free tenure was predominant, and led indirectly to the appearance of a vigorous land market. The processes of fragmentation, agglomeration and exchange which resulted from this encouraged social mobility, and led to the emergence of sub-manors in the hands of wealthy free tenants, and to a {{reduction in the number of}} small independent freeholdings. While the economy of Arden was based upon true mixed fanning, it is likely that pastoralism produced much of the capital available to both lord and peasant...|$|E
