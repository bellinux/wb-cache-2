5000|$|Indian Fish Trap State Preserve, {{also known}} as the Indian Fish Weir, is a {{historic}} site located near the Amana Colonies in rural Iowa County, Iowa. The fish weir is an array of rocks in a V-shaped formation in the Iowa River. It is the only structure of this kind in Iowa. [...] It is not known when the fish weir was built, possibly in either the Late Prehistoric period or Early Historic period. [...] Glacial boulders from a nearby bluff were probably used to construct it. Each wing of the dam is about 155 ft in length.

40|$|Abstract: Of {{the various}} types of {{technical}} fishways, fish lifts {{are one of the most}} operationally flexible yet most complicated upstream passage methods. Fish lifts are being installed with greater frequency and have enjoyed successes in passing many different species in the same facility. Fish lifts have been particularly successful in passing alosine species, and are a typical upstream passage solution for medium to high head dams. This presentation will discuss some of the advantages and challenges of constructing fish lifts and will highlight examples of fish lifts in operation. Well designed fish lifts have the ability to distribute attraction flows in multiple locations to achieve different velocities in different zones of the fishway such as the entrance, crowder pool, <b>holding</b> <b>pool,</b> or transport flumes. This operational flexibility allows different flow fields to be established for optimal attraction and movement of different target species during different times of the upstream passage season. This flexibility requires complex hydraulic adjustments and automation of mechanical systems. The inherent mechanical complexity of fish lifts means that it is important to engage a competent engineering consultant whose team understands the nuances of fish behavior as well as the technical challenges of such an important facility. This presentation will highlight some of the important design considerations for developing or evaluating a successful fish lift project...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: High dams created {{benefits}} for China in flood control, power capacity, navigation and irrigation. Along {{with the development}} of environmental regulations, development of fish passage structures at high dams are of high interest in China. There are hundreds of fish passage structures will be built in the near future for fish upstream migrating across high dams. We present one fish collection system and one fish lift design for dams higher than 100 m and discuss the technical challenges during design. The fish collection system consists of a floating barge, guidance net, light and bubble curtain at the bank, together with a reserved navigation route matched with bubble curtain and strobe light exclusion system which allow passage of boats but not fish. The fish lift concept consists of fish attraction channel, <b>holding</b> <b>pool</b> crowder hoist, tank hoist, with a track that transports fish for more than 100 m. Both fish passage facilities were designed with the procedures including: 1) requirement by government, 2) fish population survey, 3) evaluation with respect to site hydraulics and hydrology to model the working situations for fish passage, 4) structure design for fish passage, 5) planned biological evaluation as part of the design process. Although these designs have utilized knowledge from western world and are expected to help fish conservation with positive results, a huge gap between knowledge of fish behavior and fish passage design make the success of the proposed fish passage structures uncertain, and the very limited fish population at the site also questions the necessity of fish passage. Further, no downstream passages were considered for the high dams till now...|$|E
40|$|We used a swim chamber, flume, and {{large-scale}} fishway models {{to assess the}} swimming performance, behaviour, and passage success of endangered Rio Grande silvery minnow (Hybognathus amarus). Field-captured silvery minnow (53 - 88 mm total length) swam 114 - 118 cm/s (i. e., up to 20. 9 body lengths/s) in a swim chamber in water temperatures of 15, 19,and 23 °C. The relationship between time to fatigue and water velocity showed that endurance declined sharply at velocities above 60 cm/s, a threshold {{that is consistent with}} critical swimming speed estimates and may represent a transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism. Water temperature and fish length were positively correlated with swimming performance. At water velocities of 60 cm/s and less, silvery minnow routinely swam the equivalent of 50 km (125 km maximum) in a swim chamber in less than 72 h. The proportions of silvery minnow that successfully ascended a flume over sand, gravel, or cobble substrate declined as water velocity increased to 53 cm/s. Passage times increased at higher water velocities and at a faster rate over sand substrate because fish were stationary for longer periods over the lower-velocity boundary layers created by gravel and cobble at all velocities. Dual-vertical-slot fishway passage was 52 %in a less turbulent flow of 78 cm/s; passage was 8 % at a faster, more turbulent flow of 87 cm/s. Conversely, 75 % of silvery minnow ascended a rock channel fishway with a <b>holding</b> <b>pool</b> present and a 1 % hydraulic gradient in low (58 -cm/s) and high (83 -cm/s) mean flow velocities. Differences in willingness to swim, longer test duration, and the mosaic of water velocities created by the bed roughness elements may explain the higher silvery minnow passage success in the rock channel. Predictive swimming fatigue relationships, together with fish length and water temperature, may guide decisions regarding fishway lengths and velocities so as to permit passage of Rio Grande silvery minnow...|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that, with fixed {{transaction}} {{costs in the}} market for risky assets, investors with wealth below a certain threshold will <b>hold</b> <b>pooled</b> index funds that charge a proportional fee, rather than the market portfolio chosen by wealthier investors. If a portfolio of closed-end index funds yields greater volatility of returns to investors than open-end index funds, and charges the same fees, the closed-end funds need to trade at a discount in equilibrium to attract buyers. The same applies to actively managed funds if higher fees fully reflect extra expected returns from the managers’ skill. In this case excess volatility is a sufficient condition for closed-end fund discounts. It is unnecessary for discount risk to be systematic. Closed-end fund, discount, excess volatility...|$|R

40|$|The {{incomplete}} combustion {{of biomass}} and fossil fuels produces black carbon (BC). BC is recalcitrant {{and serves as}} a long term <b>holding</b> <b>pool</b> for carbon, with a mean residence time of one to two orders of magnitude greater than unburnt carbon on land. Yet the known sources of BC are far larger than the known sinks, which led to studies of BC in the ocean’s dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reservoir. The goal of this dissertation was to measure the abundance and residence times of BC in sediment, sinking particles and DOC {{in order to understand the}} cycling of BC in the ocean. I found that BC in northeast Pacific sediments was older by 6, 200 ± 2, 200 14 C years than the concurrently deposited sedimentary organic carbon, suggesting that BC ages within DOC for millennia before deposition to sediments. Sinking particulate organic carbon may provide the main transport mechanism of aged BC into sediments. A solid phase extraction (SPE) technique was modified to extract DOC from seawater, and provided the methodological basis by which BC composition, concentration and Δ 14 C values were determined. This SPE method isolated 43 ± 6 % of the DOC from seawater. I found that the composition of SPE-BC was less aromatic in the ocean samples than those in a set of river standards. The average concentration of SPE-BC in the surface ocean samples was 1. 6 ± 0. 1 μM and 1. 2 ± 0. 1 μM in a deep ocean sample. The average 14 C age of surface SPE-BC is 4, 500 ± 3, 000 14 C years, and is much older in the deep water sample from the Sargasso Sea (23, 000 ± 3, 000 14 C years). I calculate that the SPE-BC pool is approximately 14 ± 2 Gt C in the open ocean. This value is a minimum estimate, because it does not include the BC content in 57 % of the DOC that was not isolated using SPE methods in this work. BC can explain a small part of the 4, 000 – 6, 500 14 C years age of DOC, but is not the major cause. The range of SPE-BC structures and Δ 14 C values found in this work suggest that oceanic SPE-BC is not homogeneous, but that it contains several distinct pools of BC with widely ranging residence times...|$|E
