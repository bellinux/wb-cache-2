5|$|In late 1990 after <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> under Saddam Hussein invaded and {{occupied}} Kuwait, ultimately {{leading to the}} Gulf War, American commentators and Middle East experts {{expressed concern about the}} possible consequences of the Arab street in the region rising up in support of Saddam against their own governments, many of whom (particularly Egypt) had joined the military coalition led by the United States. This did not happen when the actual war began, nor for the hundred days of combat before <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> retreated and surrendered. A year later, in 1992, David Pollock of the United States Information Agency (USIA) wrote a lengthy paper arguing that those commentators had seriously misunderstood the Arab street and, by extension, all Arab public opinion.|$|E
5|$|Italian Tornados, {{along with}} RAF Tornados, {{took part in}} the first Gulf War in 1991. Operation Locusta saw eight Tornado IDS interdictors {{deployed}} from Gioia del Colle, Italy, to Al Dhafra, Abu Dhabi, as a part of Italy's contribution to the coalition. During the conflict, one aircraft was lost to Iraqi anti-aircraft fire, the pilots ejected safely and were captured by <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
5|$|Qatari AMX-30s saw combat {{during the}} Gulf War at the Battle of Khafji, where on 30 January 1991 they counter-attacked {{in an attempt}} to retake the city of Khafji from <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> which had {{occupied}} it the night before. During the action, Qatari AMX-30s knocked out three Iraqi T-55s and captured four more. At least one Qatari AMX-30 was lost during the battle.|$|E
50|$|The Ministry directs all the <b>Iraqi</b> Armed <b>Forces,</b> {{comprising}} a Joint Headquarters, the <b>Iraqi</b> Ground <b>Forces</b> Command (which {{controls the}} Army), the <b>Iraqi</b> Special Operations <b>Forces,</b> the <b>Iraqi</b> Army, the Iraqi Navy (including Marines), and the <b>Iraqi</b> Air <b>Force.</b>|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the day, the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>force,</b> {{outside of}} Habbaniya, had grown to roughly a brigade.|$|R
50|$|In 1956 it {{was handed}} over to the <b>Iraqi</b> Air <b>Force,</b> and it then became an <b>Iraqi</b> Air <b>Force</b> airfield.|$|R
5|$|After the Cold War, the {{conflict}} in the Middle East triggered a crisis in 1990, when Iraq under Sadaam Hussein invaded and attempted to annex Kuwait, an ally of the United States. Fearing that the instability would spread to other regions, President George H.W. Bush launched Operation Desert Shield, a defensive force buildup in Saudi Arabia, and Operation Desert Storm, in a staging titled the Gulf War; waged by coalition forces from 34 nations, led by the United States against Iraq ending in the successful expulsion of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> from Kuwait, restoring the former monarchy.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> were defeated, the U.N. {{mandated}} that the U.S. withdraw from Iraq, ending the Gulf War. By {{the end of}} combat operations, the 24th Infantry Division advanced 260 miles and destroyed 360 tanks and other armored personnel carriers, 300 artillery pieces, 1,200 trucks, 25 aircraft, 19 missiles, and over 500 pieces of engineer equipment. The division took over 5,000 Iraqi prisoners of war while suffering only eight killed, 36 wounded, and five non-combat casualties.|$|E
5|$|After the {{planning}} for the invasion, Dutton took command of 3 Commando Brigade, which was already serving in Afghanistan. In 2003, he led the brigade into the start of Iraq War, supported by units from the British Army {{as well as the}} United States Marine Corps, making Dutton the first British officer to command American troops since the Second World War. He commanded his men through heavy resistance from <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> {{in the early days of}} the war.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Iraqi</b> Armed <b>Forces</b> are the {{military}} <b>forces</b> of the <b>Iraqi</b> government. They consist of the Iraqi Army, the <b>Iraqi</b> Air <b>Force,</b> and the <b>Iraqi</b> Navy.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 106 - 111). This thesis {{investigates the}} causes and consequences of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forced</b> migration with which Jordan has had to contend since 1990. Extensive migratory waves flooded the Kingdom and are still expected to increase. The study focuses on the domestic and international aspects of this case, particularly the policies involved with addressing the migration of Iraqis into Jordan. Specifically, the thesis is structured around the question: How has Jordan dealt with and responded {{to the challenges of}} <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forced</b> migration? Given the limited body of literature on this topic, this thesis attempts to provide a starting point for more detailed study. As a result, my conclusion proposes recommendations for further research as well as frameworks which aim to address the numerous challenges facing the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forced</b> migrants and Jordan, their host country. 1 bound copy: xiv, 115 leaves; ill.; 30 cm.

25|$|The Iraqi Army, officially the <b>Iraqi</b> Ground <b>Forces,</b> is {{the ground}} force {{component}} of the <b>Iraqi</b> Armed <b>Forces,</b> having been active in various incarnations throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.|$|R
5|$|E-3 Sentry {{aircraft}} {{were among}} the first to deploy during Operation Desert Shield, where they immediately established as an around-the-clock radar screen to defend against <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces.</b> During Operation Desert Storm, E-3s flew 379 missions and logged 5,052 hours of on-station time. The data collection capability of the E-3 radar and computer subsystems allowed an entire air war to be recorded for the first time in history. In addition to providing senior leadership with time-critical information on the actions of enemy forces, E-3 controllers assisted in 38 of the 41 air-to-air kills recorded during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|On August 1, 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein {{sent the}} invading <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> into {{neighboring}} Kuwait, a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq {{as part of}} its territory. This invasion sparked the initiation of the Persian Gulf War and it brought worldwide condemnation. An estimated 140,000 Iraqi troops quickly took control of Kuwait City and moved on to the Saudi Arabia/Kuwait border. The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the U.S. Central Command, headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf, because of its important petroleum reserves.|$|E
5|$|The Iraqi Army, led by Bakr Sidqi, an {{experienced}} brigadier general, an Iraqi nationalist and general of Kurdish origin, {{although not a}} Kurdish nationalist, moved north in order to crush the Assyrian revolt. The <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> started executing every Assyrian male found in the mountainous Bekher region between Zakho and Duhok starting from 8 August 1933. Assyrian civilians were transported in military trucks from Zakho and Dohuk to uninhabited places, in batches of eight or ten, where they were shot with machine guns and run over by heavy armoured cars {{to make sure no}} one survived.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} truce, the <b>Iraqis</b> {{increased}} their <b>force</b> to about 10,000. Ultimately, the <b>Iraqi</b> expeditionary <b>force</b> numbered around 18,000 men.|$|R
5000|$|Iraq: <b>Iraqi</b> Air <b>Force.</b> The <b>Iraqi</b> Air <b>Force</b> {{received}} {{a number of}} Su-22 models, of which some were taken by Iran in 1991. None survived the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States.|$|R
50|$|The aerial strike {{force was}} made up of over 2,250 combat aircraft, which {{included}} 1,800 US aircraft, which fought against an <b>Iraqi</b> <b>force</b> of about 500 Soviet-built MiG-29, MiG-25, and MiG-23, and French-made Mirage F1 fighters.|$|R
5|$|The {{first phase}} of Operation Desert Storm, which began on January 17, 1991, was an air {{offensive}} to secure air superiority and attack <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces,</b> targeting key Iraqi command and control centers, including the cities of Baghdad and Basra. Cheney turned most other Department of Defense matters over to Deputy Secretary Atwood and briefed Congress during the air and ground phases of the war. He flew with Powell to the region to review and finalize the ground war plans.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1969, the AMX-30 and {{variants}} were ordered by Greece, soon followed by Spain. In the coming years, the AMX-30 would be exported to Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Cyprus and Chile. By {{the end of}} production, 3,571 units of AMX-30s and its variants had been manufactured. Both Spain and Venezuela later began extensive modernization programs to {{extend the life of}} their vehicles and to bring their tanks up to more modern standards. In the 1991 Gulf War, AMX-30s were deployed by both the French and Qatari armies. Qatari AMX-30s saw action against <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> at the Battle of Khafji. France and most other nations replaced their AMX-30s with more up-to-date equipment {{by the end of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Distressed by the {{occupation}} of Khafji, Saudi commander General Khaled bin Sultan appealed to American General Norman Schwarzkopf for an immediate air campaign against <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> {{in and around the}} city. However this was turned down because the buildings would make it difficult for aircraft to spot targets without getting too close. It was instead decided that the city would be retaken by Arab ground forces. The task fell to the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 7th Battalion, composed of Saudi infantry and two Kuwaiti tank companies attached to the task force. These were supported by U.S. Army Special Forces and Marine Reconnaissance personnel.|$|E
25|$|The US-dominated {{multinational}} force in Iraq still exercise considerable {{power in the}} country and, with the <b>Iraqi</b> armed <b>forces,</b> conduct military operations against the Iraqi insurgency. The role of <b>Iraqi</b> government <b>forces</b> in providing security is increasing.|$|R
50|$|The Ground Forces Command at Victory Base Complex near Baghdad Airport is {{the most}} {{important}} fighting formation in the Iraqi Army. The headquarters of the <b>Iraqi</b> Ground <b>Forces</b> Command and the <b>Iraqi</b> Joint <b>Forces</b> Command are the same entity.|$|R
5000|$|On day 19, <b>Iraqi</b> Security <b>Forces,</b> {{advised by}} US Special Forces, {{detained}} an extremist leader and a terrorist financier in separate operations in Safwan, Iraq. <b>Iraqi</b> and US <b>forces</b> also detained {{the leader of}} an extremist group believed {{to be responsible for}} mortar and explosive projectile attacks against <b>Iraqi</b> and Coalition <b>Forces.</b>|$|R
5|$|Throughout 28 January, the Coalition {{received}} {{a number of}} warnings suggesting an impending Iraqi offensive. The Coalition was flying two brand-new E-8A Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) aircraft, which picked up the deployment and movement of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> to the area opposite of Khafji. Observation posts 2, 7 and 8 also detected heavy Iraqi reconnoitering along the border, and their small teams of air-naval gunfire liaison Marines called in air and artillery strikes throughout the day. Lieutenant Colonel Richard Barry, commander of the forward headquarters of the 1st Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Intelligence Group, sent warnings about an impending attack to Central Command. CentCom leaders were too preoccupied with the air campaign to heed them however, and so the Iraqi operation came as a surprise.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013 {{one of the}} Globemasters {{which was}} {{deployed}} to the Middle East was, along with a RAAF Hercules, tasked with flying peacekeepers into South Sudan to reinforce the United Nations force there following an outbreak of fighting. This airlift was completed in mid-January, by which time the Australian C-17 had made eight flights into South Sudan from Brindisi in Italy and Djibouti. During September and December 2014, RAAF Globemasters flew five sorties into Iraq to deliver weapons and ammunition destined for <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Following the deployment of Australian fighter aircraft in late 2014 to attack ISIL forces as part of Operation Okra, C-17s have also conducted regular flights from Australia to the Middle East carrying munitions and specialised equipment.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, {{as part of}} Operation Okra the Australian Army {{deployed}} a Special Operations Task Group (SOTG) {{of approximately}} 200 personnel to the United Arab Emirates in preparation for operations to assist and advise Iraqi Security Forces following an offensive by Islamic State forces. The soldiers {{were expected to be}} deployed to Iraq when a legal framework covering their presence in the country was agreed between the Australian and Iraqi Governments. The majority of the SOTG was reported to be made up of C Company, 2nd Commando Regiment. It began moving into Iraq in early November. The 2nd Commando Regiment was tasked with training the Iraq government's Counter Terrorism Service. Personnel from SOTG have also been involved in co-ordinating airstrikes remotely to assist <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> engaged in clearance operations. From September 2015, the strength of SOTG rotations were reduced to approximately 80 personnel.|$|E

5|$|In late 2008, US forces began {{accelerating}} their {{move out}} of cities across Iraq, turning over the task of maintaining security to <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces.</b> The Marines pulled out of both Fallujah and Haditha Dam in November and December. Lance Corporal Brandon Lara from 3rd Battalion 4th Marines was the last American service member killed in Anbar, on 19 July 2009. In early August, a unit of Marines operating in Anbar located and recovered the body of Navy Captain Scott Speicher, who had been missing in action since the 1991 Gulf War. By 6 October 2009, the last two Marine Regiments had left, ending the American combat presence. Experts and many Iraqis were worried that AQI might resurface and attempt mass-casualty attacks to destabilize the country. There was a spike {{in the number of}} suicide attacks, and AQI rebounded in strength through November 2009 and appeared to be launching a concerted effort to cripple the government.|$|E
5|$|In response, the United Nations {{began to}} pass a series of resolutions {{demanding}} the withdrawal of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> from Kuwait. Afraid that Saudi Arabia would be invaded next, the Saudi government requested immediate military aid. As a result, the United States began marshalling forces {{from a variety of}} nations, styled the Coalition, on the Arabian peninsula. Initially, Saddam Hussein attempted to deter Coalition military action by threatening Kuwait's and Iraq's petroleum production and export. In December 1990, Iraq experimented with the use of explosives to destroy wellheads {{in the area of the}} Ahmadi loading complex, developing their capability to destroy Kuwait's petroleum infrastructure on a large scale. On 16 January, Iraqi artillery destroyed an oil storage tank in Khafji, Saudi Arabia, and on 19 January the pumps at the Ahmadi loading complex were opened, pouring crude oil into the Persian Gulf. The oil flowed into the sea at a rate of 200,000 barrels a day, becoming one of the worst ecological disasters to that date.|$|E
5|$|On 4 February 2004, I Corps forward {{headquarters}} {{deployed to}} Iraq. The element, called Task Force Olympia, deployed to Mosul, Iraq in January 2004, where it assumed its mission from the 101st Airborne Division {{to form a}} headquarters to exercise command and control of all coalition and <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> in northern Iraq. It coordinated the efforts of both of the active Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, attached engineers, civil affairs, signal, and other supporting units as well as Iraqi security forces, eventually numbering more than 12,000. The Iraqi security forces included four Civil Defense Corps battalions, three Border Police battalions, several thousand members of the Iraq Facility Protection Security Forces and an Armed Forces battalion. After {{more than a year}} in Iraq, the corps forward headquarters handed over responsibility for northern Iraq to the soldiers of Task Force Freedom and 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in February 2005.|$|E
