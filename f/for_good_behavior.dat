5|$|In a Year 3 {{elementary}} {{classroom in}} South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan {{was put into}} place. The study gave limits on the amounts of questions the children could ask, {{and if they did}} not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>behavior,</b> the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.|$|E

The grand jury charged James with spending $58,000 on city-owned credit cards for personal gain and orchestrating a scheme to sell city-owned land at below-market prices to his companion, who immediately re-sold the land to developers and gained a profit of over $500,000.

5|$|On July 13, 1995, Cameron County {{officials}} and state authorities traveled to Mexico City to ask Mexican officials to prosecute Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez for Fischer's murder. Thousands of documents were translated from English to Spanish {{and handed over}} to Mexico's attorney general for review. On July 15, Mexican officials agreed to prosecute both of them for the murder in an international prosecution court in Mexico City. Texas prosecutors asked the Mexican government to use Article 4 of the Mexican Federal Penal Code, a little-used provision that permits Mexican citizens to be prosecuted in Mexico for crimes they committed outside the country. In order for the provision to take effect, it required the accused to be in Mexican territory; not to have faced justice {{in the country where}} the crime was committed; and that the crime was not only illegal in the country where it was committed, but also in Mexico. Murder in Mexico carries a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison, though it is common for people to be released after 15 to 25 years <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>behavior.</b> The Cameron County office said they would use a federal prosecutor from Tamaulipas as the judge. The two accused would be issued an arrest warrant and asked to appear in court where a federal judge would review their case and determine the punishment in a few months. When Puentes Pizaña heard the news, he was surprised and angered by the decision. He maintained his innocence saying he was only a car thief. Olivarez was in custody in a Matamoros prison. On September 20, a Mexican federal judge agreed to prosecute Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez for the murder. Both of them were eventually found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison.|$|E
