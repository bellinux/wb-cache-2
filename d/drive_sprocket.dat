The <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> had the track-saving but more complicated rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of five double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the Schachtellaufwerk layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front axle had transversely mounted leaf springs and shock absorbers - the only ones on the vehicle.|$|E

5|$|The Porsche hull designs {{included}} a rear-mounted turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension {{was the same}} as on the Elefant tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired bogies sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive (fundamentally identical to a Diesel-electric transmission, only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the prime mover), similar to a gasoline-electric hybrid but without a storage battery; two separate drive trains in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; gasoline engine – electric generator – electric motor – <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket.</b> This method of propulsion had been attempted before on the Tiger (P) (later Elefant prototypes) and in some US designs, but had never been put into production. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later Jagdtiger tank destroyers. Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives. Dr. Porsche's unorthodox designs gathered little favour.|$|E
50|$|The Grizzly's {{suspension}} used 17-tooth <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets</b> and CDP tracks.

25|$|Most bicycle hubs {{incorporate}} a freewheel {{to allow the}} pedals to remain stationary while the bicycle is in motion, so that the rider can coast, i.e., ride without pedalling using forward momentum. A fixed-gear drivetrain has the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> (or cog) threaded or bolted directly to {{the hub of the}} back wheel, so that the pedals are directly coupled to the wheel. During acceleration, the pedal crank drives the wheel, but in other situations, the rear wheel can drive the pedal cranks. This direct coupling allows a cyclist to apply a braking force with the legs and bodyweight, by resisting the rotation of the cranks. It also makes it possible to cycle backwards.|$|E

25|$|Internal gearing is {{so called}} {{because all the}} gears {{involved}} are hidden within a wheel hub. Hub gears work using internal planetary, or epicyclic, gearing which alters {{the speed of the}} hub casing and wheel relative to the speed of the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket.</b> They have just a single chainring and a single rear sprocket, almost always with a straight chain path between the two. Hub gears are available with between 2 and 14 speeds; weight and price tend to increase with the number of gears. All the advertised speeds are available as distinct gear ratios controlled by a single shifter (except for some early 5-speed models which used two shifters). Hub gearing is often used for bicycles intended for city-riding and commuting.|$|E
25|$|Initially the {{armament}} was a Type 91 6.5×50mm machine gun, {{although in}} later models carried a Type 92 7.7 mm machine gun. The suspension consisted of four bogies - two on each side. These were suspended by bell-cranks resisted by armored compression springs placed horizontally, one {{each side of}} the hull, externally. Each bogie had two small rubber road wheels with the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> at the front and the idler at the rear. There were two track-return rollers. In combat service the Type 94 was found to be prone to throwing its tracks in high speed turns. Further redesign work was carried out in 1937 on the suspension and the small idler was replaced by a larger diameter idler wheel suspended from a rocker arm which was now in ground contact; it did not completely solve the problem. A better suspension on a longer chassis appeared in later models of the Type 94.|$|E
25|$|The Type 62 light tank {{uses the}} torsion bar {{suspension}} {{which consists of}} five road wheels on each side with a prominent gap {{between the first and}} second road wheel and an even space between second, third, fourth and fifth road wheel. The road wheels are smaller and lighter than those from the Type 59 main battle tank. The track is driven by a <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> at the rear, with an idler at the front. There are no return rollers. In effort to reduce the overall weight of the tank the original 12150L 12-cylinder liquid-cooled diesel engine from Type 59 main battle tank was powered down from 523hp (390kW) to 430hp (321kW). This modified version of the 12150L engine weights considerably less and was designated 12150L-3. This new engine gave the Type 62 a maximum road speed of 60km/h, maximum cross country speed of 35km/h, maximum road operational range of 500km and power-to-weight ratio of 20.5hp/tonne (15.3kW/tonne). The tank can cross 0.8 m high vertical obstacles, 2.85 m trenches, 30° side slopes and ford 1.4 m deep water obstacles (5 m when equipped with a snorkel).|$|E
50|$|The WZ-111 {{featured}} a 750 hp supercharged diesel engine and torsion bar suspension system. The idler wheels were in front with <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets</b> in the rear. Many of the suspension components {{were the same}} type used in Soviet heavy tank designs such as the IS-2.|$|R
50|$|The <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets</b> are at {{the front}} with six road wheels, using torsion bar suspension. The BMP-1 has a ground {{pressure}} of (0.6 kg/cm²) {{and is able to}} cross snow-covered and boggy terrain. It has the range, off-road speed and cross-country ability necessary to keep up with fast-moving MBTs.|$|R
50|$|As part of {{the rapid}} {{development}} program, the Loyd used parts from other vehicles: From the Universal Carrier, the track, <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets,</b> and Horstmann suspension units; from the Fordson 7V, the chassis, engine, gearbox, torque tube and front axle. The brake drums and back plates were designed specifically for the Loyd.|$|R
25|$|The engine {{compartment}} {{is located in}} the rear of the vehicle and consists of: a 2V-06-02 water-cooled diesel engine developing 450hp, a main clutch, a gearbox, a final drives, and brakes. The suspension of the vehicle consists of five rubber-tyred road wheels on each side, a <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> at the rear, an idler at the front, and four track-return rollers. The BMD-3 is fitted with a new hydromechanical transmission with hydrostatic steering mechanism. This adjustable suspension gives a ground clearance between 130 and 530mm with 450mm being the default. This hydropneumatic suspension allows the BMD-3 to decrease its height to be able to board transport aircraft like the Il-76M. The ground clearance is adjusted by the driver and it takes 10 seconds to lower or raise the suspension. The maximum road speed is 70km/h and the maximum off-road speed is 45km/h. The vehicle can achieve an operational range of up to 500km on paved roads and can climb up to 60% gradient and move on a 30% side slope. The ground pressure exerted by the BMD-3 is 0.48 kg/cm2 with standard tracks and 0.32kg/cm2 with broader tracks.|$|E
25|$|The 2S6 combat vehicle {{uses the}} GM-352 and later GM-352M chassis {{developed}} and {{produced by the}} Minsk Tractor Plant (MTZ) which has six road wheels with hydropneumatic suspension on each side, a <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> at the rear and three return rollers. An NBC system is also integrated into the chassis, which is protected -as the entire vehicle- from small arms fire (7,62) and shell splinters by the armor, {{as well as an}} automatic fire suppression system, an automatic gear change and diagnostic capability are available with latest Tunguska-M1 which uses the new GM-5975 chassis developed and produced by MMZ. GM-5975.25 has a cruising range of 500km and a maximum speed of 65km per hour. It can function at a relative humidity of 98 per cent at 35 degrees C, in ambient temperatures of −50 degrees C to 50 degrees C and up to an altitude of 3,000 m. It has an ability of climb up to 35 degrees, can cross slopes of 25 degrees, 2 m width ditch, 1 m depth ford. Overall, the layout is similar to the previous ZSU-23-4 with a large central 360-degree rotating turret (designated the 2A40) containing the armament, sensors and three of the crew: the commander, gunner and radar operator. The driver sits in the front left of the hull, with a gas turbine APU to his right and the multi-fuel diesel engine {{in the rear of the}} hull.|$|E
500|$|As the Verdeja1 program dissolved, Captain Verdeja {{began to}} design a successor, taking into {{consideration}} the lessons learned during the opening campaigns of the Second World War. The new design featured a reorganized engine bay {{at the rear of}} the chassis, which meant moving the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> to the rear as well. The movement of the engine's location allowed for better cooling of the vehicle's motor and the fighting compartment, as well as allowing the turret to be moved forward. The vehicle's armor was also increased substantially. [...] This new tank was not approved for production or further development, due to continued postponement of the production of the Verdeja1 for reasons which included offers by the German government to supply the Panzer IV's engine for the Verdeja1. Although production of the new vehicle finally began in 1942, it was not until August 1944 that the Verdeja2 prototype was delivered. [...] The decision to purchase a number of German armored vehicles delayed the decision to begin production of the Verdeja2; ultimately the vehicle was left untouched until 1950, when there was a failed attempt to mount a new engine.|$|E

[...] With these new vehicles integrated into the army and the fiscal problems which plagued the Verdeja1, the Verdeja2 remained unimproved until 1950, when there was an attempt to fit a Pegaso Z-202 engine. [...] Despite this, the Verdeja remained on factory grounds until 1973, when it was transferred to the Infantry Academy of Toledo.|$|E
2500|$|The T-34 was {{powered by}} a Model V-2-34 38.8L V12 Diesel engine of 500hp (370kW), giving {{a top speed of}} 53km/h (33mph).

40|$|In a chain canveyor system, {{tensile force}} and chain slack have a {{significant}} effect on a material's vibration and transferring efficiency. Therefore it becomes an important problem for the chain conveyor to control tensile force and chain slack, Nowadays, most chain conveyor <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets</b> are <b>driven</b> by a motor, and the <b>driven</b> <b>sprocket</b> is controlled by a brake to give a moderate tensile force. However, it is difficult to adequately control the tensile force, because the brake has a tendency to influence the torque and revolution of the driving motor. We then developed a new driving system which has two motors; one is the main motor for conveying materials and the other is an auxiliary motor which is used to control tensile force and chain slack without influencing torque and revolution of the main motor. In this report, we describe the performance of this system...|$|R
2500|$|Chainsaw {{protective}} fabric {{works on}} a number of principles. The outermost layer can be made both tough and slippery, to protect against minor damage which could compromise the filler material. Beneath this, long, loose fibres of polyester, Avertic, ballistic nylon or Kevlar are laid in layers. When a saw contacts the trousers, the outer layer is immediately cut through but the inner is drawn out and wraps around the saw's <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket,</b> locking it solid and halting the chain, limiting damage to the operator's leg. The length of the fabrics and number of layers match the safety class. In case of an accident the fabric is pulled out of the upper and lower seam and wrap around the sprocket as described above. Protection is only given for gas [...] chain saws, not for electrical saws. Trousers should be slightly baggy, so that there is give, to prevent the chain pulling the operator's leg into the chainsaw. Instead the 'baggy' excess fabric is pulled out and into the chain mechanism, thereby stopping the saw. After stopping a saw, the damaged trousers must be scrapped, having done their job.|$|E
2500|$|The , water-cooled, six-cylinder Praga engine {{produced}} [...] at 2500rpm. It sat in {{the rear}} of the fighting compartment and drove the transmission via a drive shaft that ran forward between the driver and commander to the gearbox. Cooling air was designed to draw air in through the commander's and driver's hatches. This had the advantage of rapidly dispersing gun combustion gases when firing, but several disadvantages. The constant draft generated by the engine greatly affected the crew during cold weather, an engine fire would force the crew to evacuate and the engine noise and heat increased crew fatigue. It had a top speed on the road of [...] and a range between [...] The semi-automatic Praga-Wilson transmission had five forward gears and one reverse gear to drive the forward-mounted <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket.</b> The suspension was a smaller version of that used in the Panzerkampfwagen 38(t). It consisted of four large road wheels per side, each pair mounted on a wheel carrier and sprung by leaf springs. There were two wheel carriers per side. The idler wheel was at the rear and one return roller was fitted. It had a ground pressure of only 0.5kg/cm2. It could cross a ditch [...] wide, climb an obstacle [...] high and ford a stream [...] deep.|$|E
2500|$|The {{torsion bar}} {{suspension}} consists of six evenly spaced large rubber-tired road wheels with the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> {{at the rear}} and the idler at the front. The road wheels are hollow to minimize weight. These hollow road wheels increase the tank's buoyancy by 30%. There are no track-return rollers. The first and last road wheels have a hydraulic shock absorber and the steel tracks have 96 links each when new, each link has a single pin. There is a small, thin, horizontal skirt over each track. Its straight 6-cylinder, 4-stroke water-cooled diesel engine was developed under the designation [...] "V-6" [...] by halving the [...] "V-12"-engine from the T-54/55. It develops 240hp (179kW) at 1,800rpm which gives it a road speed of 44km/h {{and a range of}} 370km to 400km. The vehicle can cross 1.1 m high vertical obstacles and 2.8 m wide trenches and climb 52° gradients. The engine has a cooling system and an initial heater (intended for use when the air temperature is -20°C or colder). The PT-76 has a 5-speed manual shaft-type transmission system similar to the one in the T-34/85. The gearbox has four forward gears and one reverse. The vehicle has a side clutch that enables it to make turns and a handbrake. The tank has four mounts for additional external fuel tanks {{at the rear of the}} hull. The two on the corners are for flat type external tanks and the two in the center are for a drum type. These additional tanks increase the range from 370km – 400km to 480km – 510km. The PT-76 is a reliable, simple to operate and highly mobile reconnaissance vehicle and is ideally designed for amphibious operations, but it has many limitations as a fighting vehicle.|$|E
