5|$|Glucose, {{dextrose}} or grape sugar, occurs {{naturally in}} fruits and plant juices {{and is the}} primary product of photosynthesis. Most ingested carbohydrates are converted into glucose during digestion {{and it is the}} form of sugar that is transported around the bodies of animals in the bloodstream. It can be manufactured from starch by the addition of enzymes or in the presence of acids. <b>Glucose</b> <b>syrup</b> is a liquid form of glucose that is widely used in the manufacture of foodstuffs. It can be manufactured from starch by enzymatic hydrolysis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{more general}} term <b>glucose</b> <b>syrup</b> {{is often used}} synonymously with corn syrup, since <b>glucose</b> <b>syrup</b> is in the United States most {{commonly}} made from corn starch.

40|$|The {{activity}} levels of amylolytic enzymes and β-glucanase in malts prepared from four tropical cereal grains were assessed {{to establish the}} relative usefulness of these malts for production of <b>glucose</b> <b>syrups.</b> Rice malt showed the highest activity for the amylolytic enzymes, whilst millet and sorghum malts were richest in β-glucanase activity. Optimum amylolytic enzyme development in rice malts occurred between 9 – 13 days; and 11 days for optimum β-glucanase development in millet malt. β-Amylase was the predominant enzyme in all the cereal malts except maize, for which the predominant enzyme was α-amylase.

40|$|Enzymatic {{hydrolysis}} of cassava starch {{for producing}} <b>glucose</b> <b>syrups</b> was evaluated using alpha-amylase from Bacillus licheniformis and glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger. Moreover, an enzyme mixture of &# 945;-amylase from Aspergillus kawachi and glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger was tested. Enzyme conditions for starch hydrolysis were optimized by a factorial experimental design (3 ³× 2) using as variables substrate concentration, enzyme/substrate ratio and time reaction. Optimal enzyme reactions with 100 g of starch per L were: &# 945;-amylase at pH 5. 0, 80 °C and enzyme dosage of 130. 5 U g- 1 of starch; and glucoamylase, pH 4. 5, 70 °C and enzyme dosage of 81. 5 U g- 1 of starch.

50|$|Corn syrup, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} <b>glucose</b> <b>syrup,</b> is a syrup containing dextrin, maltose, and dextrose. Partial hydrolysis of cornstarch obtains it. Corn syrup {{is important in}} the production of marshmallow because it prevents the crystallization of other sugars (like sucrose).

40|$|The high {{demands for}} sugars and the {{development}} of enzymatic technology have increased the production of sweeteners, especially for <b>glucose</b> and fructose <b>syrups.</b> This work describe a technology for <b>glucose</b> and fructose <b>syrups</b> from Brazilian cassava starch using enzymes produced by soil microrganisms isolated from the Brazilian Cerrado soil. Firstly, Aspergillus niger and Streptomyces sp. were isolated from the soil and used as glucoamylase (GA) and glucose isomerase (GI) producer sources. After characterization, GA and GI exhibited optimum pH 4. 5 and 8. 0, respectively. GA showed maximum activity at 60 ºC and GI at 85 ºC. GA and GI retained 65 and 80 %, respectively, of initial activity after 180 minutes of incubation at 60 ºC. The kinetic parameters Km and Vmáx were 0. 476 (mg. mL- 1) and 8. 58 (µmol/minute) for GA and 0. 082 (M) and 48. 20 (µmol/minute) for GI. The maximum <b>glucose</b> <b>syrups</b> production occurred after 24 hours of reaction with a 98 % yield. The production of fructose syrups with 42 % (w/v) was reached after 96 hours of reaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{food enzyme}} {{considered}} in this opinion is a beta-amylase (EC 3. 2. 1. 2), {{obtained from the}} grain of wheat (Triticum spp.) by Roquette (France). The beta-amylase {{is intended to be}} used in starch processing for production of <b>glucose</b> <b>syrups</b> containing maltose {{to be used as a}} food ingredient. Since the presence of residual amounts of total organic solids (TOS) in <b>glucose</b> <b>syrups</b> after filtration and purification during starch processing is negligible, no dietary exposure was calculated. As the food enzyme is derived from edible parts of wheat, no toxicological tests are required. Wheat is known as a gluten-containing cereal. However, the gluten content of the food enzyme was shown to be below the limit of quantification of the applied analytical method and well below the threshold value of 20 mg/kg for 'gluten-free' products. Furthermore, the potential allergenicity was evaluated by searching for similarity between the amino acid sequence of the beta-amylase and the sequences of known food allergens; no match was found. Although b-amylase from wheat is described as a potential occupational respiratory allergen, and oral wheat challenges in wheat allergic patients may result in clinical symptoms, the enzyme and the low levels of other wheat proteins will be removed from the final food ingredients through a downstream purification process. Based on the origin of the food enzyme from edible parts of grain, the manufacturing process, and the compositional and biochemical data provided, the Panel concluded that this food enzyme does not give rise to safety concerns under the intended conditions of use...|$|R
2500|$|In American popular culture, and {{according}} to some public figures who provide dietary advice, HFCS is regarded as an especially unhealthy or even toxic substance. These claims are rejected by clinical nutritionists, medical authorities, and the United States Food and Drug Administration. While scientific authorities agree that dietary sugars {{are a source of}} empty calories associated with certain health problems, the belief that glucose-fructose syrups such as HFCS are especially unhealthy is not supported by adequate scientific evidence. The belief may have arisen because of studies showing that diets extremely high in fructose may be especially unhealthy, but [...] "high fructose" [...] corn syrup is only high in fructose relative to the older <b>glucose</b> <b>syrups.</b> Nutritionally, HFCS is almost indistinguishable from table sugar.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} <b>glucose</b> <b>syrups</b> were {{manufactured by}} acid hydrolysis of corn starch at high temperature and pressure.

40|$|Starch is an {{agricultural}} raw material used in many food and industrial products. It is present in granules that vary in shape {{in the form of}} amylose and amylopectin. Starch-degrading enzymes are used on a large scale in the production of sweeteners (high fructose corn <b>syrup)</b> and concentrated <b>glucose</b> <b>syrups</b> as substrate for the fermentative production of bioethanol and basic chemicals. Over the last two decades alpha-glucanotransferases (EC 2. 4. 1. xx), such as branching enzyme (EC 2. 4. 1. 18) and 4 -alpha-glucanotransferase (EC 2. 4. 1. 25), have received considerable attention. These enzymes do not hydrolyze the starch as amylases do. Instead, alpha-glucanotransferases remodel parts of the amylose and amylopectin molecules by cleaving and reforming alpha- 1, 4 - and alpha- 1, 6 -glycosidic bond. Here we review the properties of alpha-glucanotransferases and discuss the emerging use of these enzymes in the generation of novel starch derivatives. 0 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
