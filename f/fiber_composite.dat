25|$|On 11 July 2005, Tesla and British {{sports car}} maker Lotus entered an {{agreement}} about {{products and services}} based on the Lotus Elise, where Lotus provided advice on designing and developing a vehicle as well as producing partly assembled vehicles, and amended in 2009, helped with basic chassis development. The Roadster has a parts overlap of roughly 6 percent with the Lotus Elise, a 2-inch longer wheelbase, and a slightly stiffer chassis according to Eberhard. Tesla's designers chose to construct the body panels using resin transfer molded carbon <b>fiber</b> <b>composite</b> to minimize weight; this choice makes the Roadster {{one of the least}} expensive cars with an entirely carbon fiber skin.|$|E
25|$|After {{several years}} in {{darkness}} McLaren merged with Ron Dennis's Formula Two Project-4 team. The McLaren MP4/1 (McLaren Project-4) introduced the first carbon <b>fiber</b> <b>composite</b> chassis in 1981, an innovation which, despite initial doubts over its likely performance in a crash, had been taken up by all the teams {{by the middle of}} the decade. The use of carbon fibre composite in place of aluminium honeycomb produced cars that were significantly lighter, yet also far stiffer which improved grip and therefore cornering speed. Significant skepticism regarding the use of carbon fiber chassis remained, but John Watson's 1981 crash in the MP4/1 showed that the new technology was sufficiently safe, with the violent accident leaving Watson unscathed, where similar previous incidents had resulted in death or serious injury.|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we report}} the {{potential}} use of novel carbon nanofibers (CNFs), dispersed during fabrication of glass <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> to monitor damage propagation under static loading. The use of CNFs enables {{a transformation of}} the typically non-conductive glass <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> into new <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> with appreciable electrical conductivity. The percolation limit of CNFs/epoxy nanocomposites was first quantified. The electromechanical responses of glass <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> fabricated using CNFs/epoxy nanocomposite were examined under static tension loads. The experimental observations showed a nonlinear change of electrical conductivity of glass <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> incorporating CNFs versus the stress level under static load. Microstructural investigations proved the ability of CNFs to alter the polymer matrix and to produce a new polymer nanocomposite with a connected nanofiber network with improved electrical properties and different mechanical properties compared with the neat epoxy. It is concluded that incorporating CNFs during fabrication of glass <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> can provide an innovative means of self-sensing that will allow damage propagation to be monitored in glass <b>fiber</b> <b>composites...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Carbon <b>fiber</b> <b>composite</b> is an {{increasingly}} popular non-metallic material commonly used for bicycle frames. Although expensive, it is light-weight, corrosion-resistant and strong, {{and can be}} formed into almost any shape desired. The result is a frame that can be fine-tuned for specific strength where it is needed (to withstand pedaling forces), while allowing flexibility in other frame sections (for comfort). Custom carbon fiber bicycle frames may even be designed with individual tubes that are strong in one direction (such as laterally), while compliant in another direction (such as vertically). [...] The ability to design an individual composite tube with properties that vary by orientation cannot be accomplished with any metal frame construction commonly in production. Some carbon fiber frames use cylindrical tubes that are joined with adhesives and lugs, in a method somewhat analogous to a lugged steel frame. [...] Another type of carbon fiber frames are manufactured in a single piece, called monocoque construction.|$|E
2500|$|The Z06 {{arrived as}} a 2006 {{model in the}} third quarter of 2005 and is the lightest of all Corvette models. The Z06 was {{equipped}} with the largest-displacement small-block ever produced, a new 7.0 L (427 cu in) engine codenamed LS7.

40|$|Abstract. The {{compressive}} {{response of}} polymer matrix <b>fiber</b> reinforced unidirectional <b>composites</b> (PMC’s) is in-vestigated via {{a combination of}} experiment and analysis. The study accounts for the nonlinear constitutive response of the polymer matrix material and examines the effect of fiber geometric imperfections, fiber mechanical prop-erties and fiber volume fraction on the measured compressive strength and compressive failure mechanism. Glass and carbon <b>fiber</b> reinforced unidirectional <b>composite</b> specimens are manufactured in-house with fiber volume fractions ranging over 10 60 percent. Compression test results with these specimens show that carbon <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> have lower compressive strengths than glass <b>fiber</b> <b>composites.</b> Glass <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> demonstrate a splitting failure mode {{for a range of}} low fiber volume fractions and a simultaneous splitting/kink banding failure mode for high fiber volume fractions. Carbon <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> show kink banding throughout the range of fiber volume fractions examined. Nonlinear material properties of the matrix, orthotropic material properties of the carbon fiber, initial geometric fiber imperfections and nonuniform fiber volume fraction are all included in an appropriate finite element analysis to explain some of the observed experimental results. A new analytical model prediction of the splitting failure mode shows that this failure mode is favorable for glass <b>fiber</b> <b>composites,</b> which is in agreement with test results. Furthermore, this model is able to show the influence of fiber mechanical properties, fiber volume fraction and fiber geometry on the splitting failure mode...|$|R
