500|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>once</b> {{going to}} see him when he was ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an {{unfavorable}} omen. [...] "No", he replied, [...] "it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Normally {{they don't}} kick people out... For {{me it was}} {{straight}} out the front gate. And I don't believe it was for simply painting a wall. I believe that the Vice Chancellor was p***ed off with my lack of protocol. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>once</b> sending him a memo {{on the back of}} a pie bag. That kind of thing isn't done." ...|$|E
2500|$|All I can {{remember}} is, Bob Willis had this big inswinging, in-dipping action," [...] Darling says. [...] "The ball was pitched well outside off stump {{was the last}} thing <b>I</b> <b>remember.</b> <b>Once</b> it swung in, it also cut in further. I was caught in no man's land. I was sort of caught out of position, and hit in the chest. Unfortunately, at the time, I was chewing a chewy, and I swallowed my tongue and chewy as well. That caused me to black out.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah!' said Mr. Lingnam, the monthly-magazine roll in his voice. 'All Europe is {{an armed}} camp, groaning, as <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>I</b> <b>once</b> wrote, {{under the weight}} of its accoutrements.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>once</b> at Rawal Pindi {{having seen}} a man, nearly mad with drink, sobered by being made a fool of. Some regiments may know what I mean. I hoped {{that we might}} slake off Ortheris in the same way, though he was {{perfectly}} sober. So I said-- ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remembered.</b> <b>Once</b> again their {{stockings}} were stuffed to the hem, {{and their}} tree, a marvel of light, touched the ceiling with its pliant tip on which sparkled a golden star. To them I {{was still a}} wonder-worker. For a week I put aside my dark musings and rejoiced with them in their fairy world.|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't {{it rather}} in the family? <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>once</b> {{going to see}} her mother in town and finding the leaders of both parties sitting with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [18] [...] "Bayes. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>once,</b> {{in a play}} of mine, I set off a scene, [...] i'gad, beyond expectation, {{only with}} a {{petticoat}} and the belly-ache.|$|E
6000|$|Some {{words in}} {{constant}} use he rarely explained. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>once</b> sticking up {{my hand and}} asking him in the full flow of description, [...] "Please, sir, what is flocculent?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> at <b>once</b> {{where it}} was that I had seen him--at the broker's in the city, before we sailed for America.|$|R
6000|$|... (Interrupting.) He {{said the}} churchmen stole from God. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> he <b>once</b> {{said there had}} been only one true Christian and that He died on the Cross.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> crying <b>once,</b> [...] "and {{what is your}} life? You {{are only}} trying to get money, and {{to get it from}} other people at that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then how can {{you tell}} what your {{feelings}} would be if you were to attempt to do it. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>once,</b> when I was a boy, going out to hunt cats." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, but come, now," [...] {{interrupted}} the Interesting man, [...] "there's nothing really more deceitful than anthropometric measures. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>once</b> saying (in London) to Sir Robert Bittell--the Sir Robert Bittell, you know--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Some birds, of course, {{take a lot}} of killing,” said Amblecope; “so do some fish. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>once</b> I was {{fishing in}} the Exe, lovely trout stream, lots of fish, though they don’t run to any great size—” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not exactly. But {{he was an}} American, and he knew a {{good bit}} about San Francisco, Chicago, and New York, and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> he <b>once</b> told about hunting in the Maine woods and in the Adirondacks." ...|$|R
60|$|Then, of course, <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> at <b>once,</b> {{and my mind}} {{flew back}} to the night when old Tshoza, the brother of Matiwane, Saduko's father, had cut out the cattle of the Bangu and we had fought the battle in the pass.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> {{correctly}} you <b>once</b> {{made a bad}} {{mistake in}} being equally considerate to another man," [...] said Hetty, reflectively.|$|R
60|$|Fail. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>once,</b> {{when the}} keys of the Exchequer {{were lost in}} the Rump-time, he was sent for upon an extremity, and, egad, he opens me all the locks with the blade-bone of a breast of mutton.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never heard}} that, sir," [...] said Bassett, {{more and more}} perplexed. [...] "It’s not in my book, but <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>once</b> reading, when I was at school, that spiders are {{sometimes}} attracted {{by the sound of}} a flute." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>once</b> hearing M. Renan {{say that}} he would sooner live under a {{military}} despotism than under the despotism of the Church, because the former merely limited the freedom of action, while the latter limited the freedom of mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll drop music, then," [...] {{she said}} hastily. [...] "Books? But <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> you <b>once</b> {{told me that}} you had never read {{anything}} except detective novels, and that you didn't care for poetry. Sports? I adore tennis and I am rather good at golf." ...|$|R
6000|$|Barker laughed more heartily. [...] "No. Not their business. But <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> that <b>once</b> Demorest told us, in {{the dear}} old days, that it cost {{nearly as much}} to make a water ditch as a railroad, {{in the way of}} {{surveying}} and engineering and levels, you know. And here's the plant for a railroad. Don't you see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, I {{guess it}} will break,” Mr. Westgate cheerfully declared; “there’s never {{anything}} bad over here {{but it does}} break. It was very hot when Captain Littledale was here; he did nothing but drink sherry-cobblers. He expresses some doubt in his letter whether <b>I</b> shall <b>remember</b> him—as if <b>I</b> don’t <b>remember</b> <b>once</b> mixing six sherry-cobblers for him in about fifteen minutes. I hope you left him well. I’d be glad to mix him some more.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, I don’t {{know that}} you are so much mist. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>once</b> hanging on to you like a {{drowning}} man [...] . But perhaps I had better not speak of this. It wasn’t so very long ago, and you may [...] . ” ...|$|E
60|$|I {{always think}} my {{observations}} have a peculiar piquancy when I {{have only one}} cheek rouged. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>once</b> I went out to dinner, {{and as soon as}} I sat down I grew conscious of the fact that one of my cheeks was much redder than the other.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I [Paul Botha] {{felt this}} as strongly, and never ceased {{fighting}} against closer union. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>once</b> stating these {{arguments in the}} Volksraad, and wound up my speech by saying, [...] "May Heaven grant that I am wrong in what I fear, because, if I am right, then woe, woe to the Orange Free State."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hark to that, my fair lord," [...] {{cried the}} Lady Rochefort. [...] "Take heed, I pray thee, for I {{do not wish}} to have a blight cast over me, nor a palsy of the limbs. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> that <b>once</b> before you angered Father Stephen, and my tire-woman said that I lost more hair in seven days than ever before in a month." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As for his Excellency the Count di Monte Beni's ears," [...] replied Hilda, smiling {{again at}} the dignity with which this title {{invested}} their playful friend, [...] "you know we could never see their shape, {{on account of his}} clustering curls. Nay, <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> he <b>once</b> started back, as shyly as a wild deer, when Miriam made a pretence of examining them. How do you explain that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then--oh! then I cannot say, O Wife. Perhaps {{they will}} send you back to your own country. Or perhaps they will {{separate}} us and place you in a temple where you will live alone in all honour. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> that <b>once</b> they did that to a white woman, making a goddess of her until she died of weariness. Or perhaps--well, I do not know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you ought}} to have known better than to chuck all my tools {{overboard}} for 'im, like a skeary greenhorn," [...] retorted the morose carpenter. [...] "Well--he's gone after 'em now," [...] he added in an unforgiving tone.--"On the China Station, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>once,</b> the Admiral he says to me..." [...] began the sailmaker.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next year}} came more tidings {{of a sort}} I did not understand. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>once</b> {{bringing}} back from the Cross-Roads a crumpled newspaper, which my father read again and again, and then folded up and put in his pocket. He said nothing to me of these things. But the next time I went to the Cross-Roads, the woman asked me:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nor {{her desire}} for charms. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>once</b> when I {{spoke of the}} Wheel of Life'--the lama fumbled in his bosom for his latest copy--'she was only curious about the devils that besiege children. She shall acquire merit by {{entertaining}} us--in a little while--at an after-occasion--softly, softly. Now we will wander loose-foot, waiting upon the Chain of Things. The Search is sure.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What a horridly stupid boy he must be,' {{returned}} Mysie. 'Why, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> when Jasper <b>once</b> had the 'Talisman' to do, and the {{big ones}} were so delighted. Mamma read it out, and I was just old enough to listen. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> all about Sir Kenneth and Roswal.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why--er--I can't say as to that. He didn't {{say much}} about himself, that <b>I</b> can <b>remember.</b> <b>Once</b> {{he told me about}} that child, but--but it's hazy--I can't think! Oh, it drives me crazy when I try to think! The roar of the sea gets in my ears, and the light from the {{lighthouse}} fires my brain!" [...] And the old tar began to pace the floor in a rolling gait.|$|R
6000|$|A waiter entered {{bearing a}} note, which he handed {{to me on}} a salver. I looked at him, around the room, which was still in some confusion, and down at the note, which was clearly {{addressed}} to me, J. Hardross Courage, Esq. Suddenly my eyes fell upon the smashed door, and <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> at <b>once</b> {{the events of the}} previous night. I tore open the note. It was typewritten and brief:-- ...|$|R
