25|$|Biomaterials can {{be derived}} either from nature or {{synthesized}} in the laboratory {{using a variety of}} chemical approaches utilizing metallic components, polymers, ceramics or composite materials. They are often used and/or adapted for a medical application, and thus comprises whole or part of a living structure or biomedical device which performs, augments, or replaces a natural function. Such functions may be relatively passive, like being used for a heart valve, or may be bioactive with a more interactive functionality such as hydroxy-apatite coated hip implants. Biomaterials are also used every day in <b>dental</b> <b>applications,</b> surgery, and drug delivery. For example, a construct with impregnated pharmaceutical products can be placed into the body, which permits the prolonged release of a drug {{over an extended period of}} time. A biomaterial may also be an autograft, allograft or xenograft used as a transplant material.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Prosthetic {{substructures}} for <b>dental</b> <b>application</b> are veneered by porcelain comprising {{a structure}} with different elastic modulus and thermal expansion coefficients layers. This structure may present residual stresses in different layers leading to crack propagation and delamination. Although veneering porcelain remains basically on same strength than standard feldspathic porcelains, new ceramic cores {{have been developed}} with higher mechanical properties overcoming metal substructures, improving esthetics and biocompatibility. The interface between the Procera dense sintered alumina core and the manufacturer recommended veneering porcelain (AllCeram-Degussa) were evaluated using SEM in coping shaped specimen simulating the standard dental preparation. There were neither crack presences at the interface nor porcelain delamination...|$|R
