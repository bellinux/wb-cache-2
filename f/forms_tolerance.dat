5000|$|The airway {{epithelium}} {{together with}} alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells {{play a major}} role in the initial recognition of bacterial products getting into the lower airways with the air. Since some of these products are potent proinﬂammatory stimuli it is extremely important for the immune system to distinguish between pathogens and non-pathogenic commensals. This prevents the development of constant inﬂammation and <b>forms</b> <b>tolerance</b> against harmless microbiota. This process becomes much more intriguing when taking into account that commensals often share their surface molecules with pathogens. Epithelial cells are equipped with very sensitive recognition tools - toll like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs) which recognize a broad variety of microbial structural components. After recognition of pathogenic bacteria proinﬂammatory pathways are activated and cellular components of the adaptive and innate immunity are recruited to the infection site. [...] One key regulator in this process is the NF-κB which translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and activates pro-inﬂammatory genes in epithelial cells and macrophages. The DNA-binding protein complex recognizes a discrete nucleotide sequence (5’-GGG ACT TTC T-3’) in the upstream region of a variety of response genes. The activation of NF-κB by a number of stimuli: bacterial cell walls or inﬂammatory cytokines results in its translocation to the nucleus.|$|E

Unfortunately, the meaning of tolerances in the national standard is expressed in graphical and language forms and is not adaptable for expression, processing and data transferring with computers.

This work based on the mathematical definition of <b>form</b> <b>tolerance</b> in ANSI Y 14. 5. 1 M- 1994, established the mathematical model of <b>form</b> <b>tolerance</b> for cylindrical feature. First, each tolerance in the national standard was established by vector equation.

Recently CMMs have become very popular for dimensional measurement in industry due to their flexibility, accuracy, and ease of automation. Despite the advantages offered by CMM's, problems have emerged with their use because tolerance standards require knowledge of the entire surface while a CMM provides only a sample of points on the surface. These problems could be quite challenging, and both practitioners and researchers have shown great interest. Among these problems, estimating <b>form</b> <b>tolerances</b> for different part features {{is very important to}} practitioners.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to present a method for the {{verification}} of <b>form</b> <b>tolerances</b> in free-form geometries. Method: New free-form error parameters, in accordance with ISO GPS standards are defined. Geometrical errors in 2 D e 3 D geometries are calculated using a new fitting method consisting in an association operation where nominal profile/surface is resized (with an offset), located and oriented on the non-ideal geometry. <b>Form</b> <b>tolerance</b> is estimated using peak-to-valley deviation after the best fit. Result: Automatic algorithms are implemented to analyse 2 D free-form profiles of moulds for ophthalmic lenses obtained with grinding and polishing operations and to analyse 3 D free-form surfaces of an injection moulded lamp lens for automotive industry. Discussion & Conclusion: The comparison between results obtained using this approach and using traditional fitting methods shows differences on the fitting and errors parameters estimation. In particular in the traditional fitting there is a repartition of the size error contribution in the translation and form errors. The differences increase proportionally to the offset value estimated. The calculation of offset parameter allows the separation of size from geometric errors in free-form profiles/surfaces and the “true” form error estimation...|$|R
40|$|Cobalt chrome (CoCr) alloys are {{the most}} {{extensively}} used biomaterials for manufacturing artificial implants which need nanometre scale surface finish and micrometre scale <b>form</b> <b>tolerance</b> to allow long term survival in vivo. Traditional finishing of these devices is usually carried out by manual or simple robot polishing which are time-consuming and labour-intensive. The aim of this thesis is to investigate and develop a deterministic polishing process for improving the surface finish and <b>form</b> <b>tolerance</b> of the bearing surfaces of artificial implants. In order to improve the surface finish for CoCr alloys, a Taguchi method with the consideration of interaction effects was applied to optimise the process parameters. By using the optimised process parameters, the surface roughness of workpieces can be improved up to 8 nm Sa, which is far better than 50 nm Ra, the recommended value of ISO 7206 - 2 : 2011 for metallic bearing surface of artificial implants. The evolution of all 15 parameters of surface topography during polishing process has been investigated. In addition, {{the effects of the}} combination of polishing cloths/pads and abrasives on surface topography have been investigated as well, indicating that both polishing cloths/pads and abrasives can affect the improvement of surface topography. A deterministic polishing process is dependent on the material removal which is controlled by process parameters. The way of which material removal and polishing forces were affected by the process parameters has been investigated. Based on the experimental data, a modified Preston equation model was created to predict the material removal rate for bonnet polishing of CoCr alloys. <b>Form</b> <b>tolerance</b> plays a very significant role in the bearing surfaces of artificial implants. By using the method of form correction, a new design of multi-radius femoral head which is unable to be fabricated by traditional polishing process was successfully manufactured.

However, increasing the number of data point also significantly increases the computational time and also increases computational uncertainty by adding to instability of the optimization process required to find the minimum deviation zone.
