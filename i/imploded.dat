The last dice in the casino was rolled by Bob Stupak just after 6pm on June 30, 1996. On November 26 of that year, it was finally <b>imploded</b> and demolished, much to the dismay of longtime employees and sentimentalists. Today, The Venetian stands where the Sands once stood.|$|E
5|$|Neddermeyer {{discarded}} Serber and Tolman's initial {{concept of}} implosion as assembling {{a series of}} pieces in favor of one in which a hollow sphere was <b>imploded</b> by an explosive shell. He was assisted in this work by Hugh Bradner, Charles Critchfield, and John Streib. L. T. E. Thompson was brought in as a consultant, and discussed the problem with Neddermeyer in June 1943. Thompson was skeptical that an implosion could be made sufficiently symmetric. Oppenheimer arranged for Neddermeyer and Edwin McMillan to visit the National Defense Research Committee's Explosives Research Laboratory near the laboratories of the Bureau of Mines in Bruceton, Pennsylvania (a Pittsburgh suburb), where they spoke to George Kistiakowsky and his team. But Neddermeyer's efforts in July and August at imploding tubes to produce cylinders tended to produce objects that resembled rocks. Neddermeyer {{was the only person}} who believed that implosion was practical, and only his enthusiasm kept the project alive.|$|E
5|$|The Desert Inn {{opened with}} 300 rooms and the Sky Room restaurant, {{headed by a}} chef {{formerly}} of the Ritz Paris, which once had the highest vantage point on the Las Vegas Strip. The casino, at , {{was one of the}} largest in Nevada at the time. The 9-storey St. Andrews Tower was completed during the first renovation in 1963, and the 14-storey Augusta Tower became the Desert Inn's main tower when it was completed in 1978 along with the seven-story Wimbledon Tower. The Palms Tower was completed in 1997 with the second and final renovation. The Desert Inn was the first hotel in Las Vegas to feature a fountain at the entrance. In 1997, the Desert Inn underwent a $200 million renovation and expansion, but after it was purchased for $270 million by Steve Wynn in 2000, he decided to demolish it and build a new hotel and resort. The remaining towers of the Desert Inn were <b>imploded</b> in 2004. Today, the Wynn and Encore stands where the hotel once stood.|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{detonation}} initiation is a {{topic of}} intense interest to designers of pulse detonation engines. This experimental work {{is the first to}} detonate propane-air mixtures with an <b>imploding</b> detonation wave and to detonate a gas mixture with a non-reflected, <b>imploding</b> shock. In order to do this, a unique device has been developed that is capable of generating an <b>imploding</b> toroidal detonation wave inside of a tube from a single ignition point without any obstruction to the tube flow path. As part of this study, an initiator that creates a large-aspect-ratio planar detonation wave in gas-phase explosive from a single ignition point has also been developed. The effectiveness of our initiation devices has been evaluated. The minimum energy required by the <b>imploding</b> shock for initiation was determined to scale linearly with the induction zone length, indicating the presence of a planar initiation mode. The <b>imploding</b> toroidal detonation initiator was found to be more effective at detonation initiation than the <b>imploding</b> shock initiator, using a comparable energy input to that of current initiator tubes. ...|$|R

5|$|Statues of Pirates' Hall of Famers Honus Wagner, Roberto Clemente, Willie Stargell and Bill Mazeroski are {{positioned}} {{at various points}} outside of PNC Park. Wagner and Clemente's statues were previously located outside of Three Rivers Stadium, and after the venue was <b>imploded,</b> the two statues were removed from their locations, refurbished, and relocated outside PNC Park. Wagner's statue was originally unveiled at Forbes Field in 1955. The base of Clemente's statue is shaped like a baseball diamond, with dirt from three of the fields Clemente played at—Santurce Field in Carolina, Puerto Rico, Forbes Field, and Three Rivers Stadium—at each base. On October 1, 2000, after the final game at Three Rivers Stadium, Stargell threw out the ceremonial last pitch. He was presented with {{a model of a}} statue that was to be erected in his honor outside of PNC Park. The statue was officially unveiled on April 7, 2001; however, Stargell did not attend due to health problems and died of a stroke two days later. A statue for Bill Mazeroski was added at the right field entrance, {{at the south end of}} Mazeroski Way, during the 2010 season. This was the 50th anniversary of the Pirates' 1960 World Series championship, which Mazeroski clinched with a Game 7 walk-off home run at Forbes Field. The statue itself was designed based on that event.|$|E
5|$|In Part II of the series, {{three years}} after his mission, Deidara, {{a member of the}} {{criminal}} organization Akatsuki, is sent to Sunagakure to capture Gaara. Gaara fights Deidara to protect the village, but is defeated. The members of the Akatsuki then kidnap him and extract Shukaku from his body. Gaara dies in the process, his body being recovered by Naruto and Kakashi Hatake. Chiyo sacrifices her own life to revive Gaara after coming to acknowledge Naruto and Sakura Haruno's resolve. Sometime later, he goes to the Five Kage Summit, where the Akatsuki's leader Tobi, breaks into the meeting and announces the Fourth Great Ninja War to capture the last two Tailed-Beasts. Gaara later joins the new Shinobi Alliance as its field commander to protect Naruto and Killer Bee, using Naruto's philosophy of love and the Akatsuki's philosophy of hatred to unite the army when it nearly <b>imploded</b> from internal conflict. On {{the second day of the}} war, Gaara encounters his reanimated father. Rasa reveals the truth to Gaara that his uncle's final action was his doing and that the truth that Gaara's mother always loved him, moving Gaara to tears after learning his mother's will is the force behind his sand. Rasa recognizes his son has surpassed him and entrusts Sunagakure to him after being defeated. Gaara later defeats and seals the revived Second Mizukage and joins the rest of the five Kage to fight the Madara Uchiha who was reanimated by Kabuto, nearly getting killed as a result. Later healed by Tsunade, Gaara departs with the other Kage to site of their side's battle with Tobi. Before watching him be absorbed by the Gedo Statue again, Gaara manages to make his peace with Shukaku while thanking the tailed beast for ensuring that he would meet Naruto. They take him to Minato Namikaze and Gaara holds off Madara before Might Guy takes over prior Naruto being successfully revived. Once the Infinite Tsukiyomi is activated, Gaara is caught in the illusion of being with his entire family and Naruto as his friend before being freed by Naruto and Sasuke. By the series epilogue, having the Hidden Leaf Village's Nara Clan as in-laws through Temari, Gaara remains active as the Kazekage.|$|E

40|$|<b>Imploding</b> {{toroidal}} detonation waves {{were used}} to initiate detonations in propane-air and ethylene-air mixtures inside of a tube. The <b>imploding</b> wave was generated by an initiator consisting of an array of channels filled with acetylene-oxygen gas and ignited with a single spark. The initiator {{was designed as a}} low-drag initiator tube for use with pulse detonation engines. In order to detonate hydrocarbon-air mixtures, the initiator was overfilled so that some acetylene-oxygen spilled into the tube. The overfill amount required to detonate propane-air was less than 2 % of the volume of the 1 -m-long, 76 -mm-diameter tube. The energy necessary to create an implosion strong enough to detonate propane-air mixtures was estimated to be 13 % more than that used by a typical initiator tube, although the initiator was also estimated to use less oxygen. Images and pressure traces show a regular, repeatable <b>imploding</b> wave that generates focal pressures in excess of six times the Chapman-Jouguet pressure. A theoretical analysis of the <b>imploding</b> toroidal wave performed using Whitham’s method was found to agree well with experimental data and showed that, unlike <b>imploding</b> cylindrical and spherical geometries, <b>imploding</b> toroids initially experience a period of diffraction before wave focusing occurs.
