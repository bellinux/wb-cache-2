500|$|In February 2010, Bernd Schuster {{was asked}} if Raúl did not favour Villa moving to Real Madrid, to which he responded, [...] "I have a cough," [...] which caused many {{to believe that he}} was {{implying}} the rumour to be true. Villa firmly ridiculed that idea by saying, [...] "It is impossible that a player with as much class on and off the pitch as Raúl would speak poorly of me. I have always had a good relationship with Raúl, even though we have hardly met on international duty." [...] Speaking about Raúl's record with the Spanish national team as the nation's leading top scorer, Villa said, [...] "I've got 25 goals but he's got 44 and is still playing. I'd be delighted to reach that tally as I'd help the national team achieve great victories and, in many years' time, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> name on a [...] that another young lad was trying to beat. That would be great." [...] On 25 March 2011, two years after making that remark, Villa surpassed Raúl as Spain's all-time top scorer.|$|E
60|$|He made {{no further}} remark. We entered the drawing-room. I inquired if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> aunt.|$|E
60|$|MALISE. Your {{tobacco is}} too good, Mr. Haywood. I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> way to smoking another.|$|E
60|$|At this, I {{began to}} feel uneasy, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>my</b> wife shared my trouble.|$|R
60|$|She {{sat for a}} {{while in}} silence. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>my</b> words had made an impression.|$|R
6000|$|She bit her coral lips [...] . but {{she also}} smiled. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>my</b> {{personality}} and my manners had greatly impressed her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Beautiful!" [...] cried Skene with emotion. [...] "Beautiful! There ain't but {{me and my}} boy in {{the world}} can give the upper cut like that! I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> old missis's face now! This is nuts to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I did," [...] Bartley assented. [...] "And I haven't {{given up}} the notion yet. I've read {{a good deal of}} law already; but when I came up to Boston, I had to go into {{newspaper}} work till <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> way out of the woods." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{not certain}} but that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> mother again {{before we went}} up river, {{therefore}} our parting was not as sorrowful {{as it would have}} been had I known all the perils which were to be encountered ere I looked upon her dear face again.|$|E
60|$|It {{occurred}} to him that it was unnecessary to explain. He assisted me into a sitting position, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> with <b>my</b> own eyes.|$|R
6000|$|The girl {{shuddered and}} cast a sorrowful glance toward Bradley. [...] "Ah," [...] she sighed, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> but <b>see</b> <b>my</b> beloved country once again!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh, that manner, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> in <b>my</b> visitor's face, and not {{a little}} else besides! [...] "She asks me every three minutes if I think you're coming in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm umbly {{thankful to}} you, sir,' said Mrs. Heep, in {{acknowledgement}} of my inquiries concerning her health, 'but I'm only pretty well. I haven't much to boast of. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> Uriah well settled in life, I couldn't expect much more I think. How {{do you think}} my Ury looking, sir?' ...|$|E
60|$|This {{information}} was communicated {{to me by}} Joseph, on my return from an early visit {{to one of our}} warehouses at the riverside. When I asked if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> aunt, I was informed that she had already retired to rest in her room, after the fatigue of a seven hours' journey by night.|$|E
60|$|BARTHWICK. [Staring gloomily at JACK.] This {{prosecution}} goes {{very much}} {{against the grain}} with me. I have great sympathy with the poor. In my position I 'm bound to recognise the distress there is amongst them. The condition of the people leaves much to be desired. D' you follow me? I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> way to drop it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite. I had it {{from his}} own lips. At least he told me he's fond of her, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> with <b>my</b> own eyes she's fond of him." ...|$|R
60|$|Hearing these words, and {{watching}} him attentively while he spoke, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>my</b> silence {{would be a}} mercy, not a crime. I hastened to speak of other things.|$|R
60|$|So far, no doubt, {{this was}} quite in Mrs. Finch's character. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that--but <b>my</b> mind {{was too much}} pre-occupied to draw the {{inference}} that followed. Oscar's next words enlightened me.|$|R
60|$|My end had come. I knew it; but {{had there}} been a {{doubt in my mind}} the nasty leer of triumph upon that wicked face would have {{convinced}} me. Beyond Thurid <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> Dejah Thoris, wide-eyed and horrified, struggling at her bonds. That she should be forced to witness my awful death made my bitter fate seem doubly cruel.|$|E
60|$|Half an hour passed; {{it seemed}} {{as long as a}} day. The sun just boiled down on that roof and we were nearly melted. We were dreadfully thirsty, and the heat made our heads ache, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> muslin dress fading before my very eyes. As for the roses on my best hat--but that was too {{harrowing}} to think about.|$|E
60|$|Love I {{had laid}} aside till <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> way a little clearer in the {{certainly}} perplexing combination of circumstances. Nevertheless, Philippa, I say it advisedly, {{seemed to me}} {{a good deal more}} pure and innocent than when we first met. True, she had been secretly married to a man under a name which she knew to be false.|$|E
60|$|He {{made the}} {{announcement}} as if the name alone would explain both his visit and its manner, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> by <b>my</b> companion's unresponsive face, that it meant no more to him than to me.|$|R
60|$|I made no {{movement}} towards opening the gate. The newcomer advanced {{to within a}} few feet of me, and then paused. He leaned a little forward. He was doubtful, as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> of <b>my</b> identity.|$|R
60|$|Charley's {{last report}} {{was that the}} boy was quiet. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> from <b>my</b> window, the lantern they had left him burning quietly; and I went to bed very happy {{to think that he}} was sheltered.|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess I'll hev {{to speak}} out an' tell all," [...] said he, his voice {{trembling}} a little, [...] "although I thought fer a minnit <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> way without. I can't sell my vote, miss, 'cause I've been plannin' t'vote fer Mr. Forbes anyhow. But we wanted some uv th' money that's being wasted, an' we wanted it mighty bad." ...|$|E
60|$|O'FLAHERTY. If you'd {{been brought}} up by my mother, sir, you'd {{know better than to}} joke about her. What I'm telling you is the truth; and I wouldn't tell it to you if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> {{way to get out of}} the fix I'll be in when my mother comes here this day to see her boy in his glory, and she after {{thinking}} all the time it was against the English I was fighting.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{minister}} of the Gospel in this town is placed in a peculiar position, Sir Thomas," [...] said Mr. Pabsby very slowly, [...] "and of all the ministers of religion in Percycross mine is the most peculiar. In this matter I would wish to be guided wholly by duty, and if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> way clearly I would at once declare it to you. But, Sir Thomas, I owe much to the convictions of my people." ...|$|E
60|$|In truth <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> and <b>my</b> vision {{confirmed}} {{me in my}} resolve, {{though that}} was like the very parting of spirit and flesh. Yet a little longer I would stay since {{it was the last}} time.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>my</b> mate was a {{good deal}} confounded at this ingenuous admission; for, in his eyes, {{breaking}} the commandments was either killing, stealing, or blaspheming. The other sins of the decalogue he had come by habit to regard as peccadilloes.|$|R
60|$|Above {{the heads}} of the contestants <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> from <b>my</b> {{elevated}} station upon the dais the face of my old friend Kantos Kan. He was leading the little party that had won its way into {{the very heart of the}} palace of Salensus Oll.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I don't mind {{telling you}} about it now. When Mellish had me up after school today, I'd got my yarn all ready. There wasn't a flaw in it {{anywhere}} as far as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> <b>My</b> idea was this. I told him I'd been to Yorke's room {{the day before the}} exam, to ask him if he had any marks for us. That was all right. Yorke was doing the two Unseen papers, and it was just the sort of thing a fellow would do to go and ask him about the marks.' ...|$|E
60|$|The sun was {{certainly}} lower, {{much lower than}} it had been; the air was very much cooler. I perceived I must have slept some time. It {{seemed to me that}} a faint touch of misty blueness hung about the western cliff I leapt to a little boss of rock and surveyed the crater. I could see no signs of mooncalves or Selenites, nor could I see Cavor, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> handkerchief far off, spread out on its thicket of thorns. I looked bout me, and then leapt forward to the next convenient view-point.|$|E
6000|$|How slowly those dreadful {{two hours}} went by! Once I heard a low, rasping sound, which I {{took to be}} the {{creature}} licking its own fur. Several times those greenish eyes gleamed at me through the darkness, but never in a fixed stare, and my hopes grew stronger that my presence had been forgotten or ignored. At last the least faint glimmer of light came through the windows--I first dimly saw them as two grey squares upon the black wall, then grey turned to white, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> terrible companion once more. And he, alas, could see me! ...|$|E
5000|$|In a {{newspaper}} interview, Henson later said: [...] “I {{was in the}} lead that had overshot the mark a couple of miles. We went back then and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>my</b> footprints were the first at the spot.” [...] Henson proceeded to plant the American flag.|$|R
60|$|As I {{advanced}} the fog became denser. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing beyond <b>my</b> nose. Even {{the snow and}} ice I trod were invisible.|$|R
6000|$|... "In going downstairs {{the first}} time I found an {{unexpected}} difficulty because <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>my</b> feet; indeed I stumbled twice, {{and there was an}} unaccustomed clumsiness in gripping the bolt. By not looking down, however, I managed to walk on the level passably well.|$|R
