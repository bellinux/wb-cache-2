25|$|The {{first three}} series of Washington-Franklin postage stamps {{depicted}} Washington on every denomination {{except for the}} ONE CENT issue, which presented Benjamin Franklin's profile inside the same frame design {{as that of the}} Washington issues. On January 11, 1912 Franklin for the first time began to appear on denominations of 8-cents and higher. Each of the seven successive series brought various changes in design, color, perforations, paper and sometimes printing methods. In addition to these series, there are a few individual stamps—issued {{near the end of the}} Washington-Franklin era—that can not be categorized within one of the series because of design or perforation anomalies. The last Washington-Franklin was issued in May 1923, a 1-cent green Washington-head with olive leaves, (Scott 544) would coincidentally also become the rarest postage stamp of the issue (errors excepted) and can only be positively identified by measuring its outer frame dimensions. Because its distinct features are not readily apparent, this variety sometimes turns up <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> collections. This, however, is unusual, as the stamp was printed in very limited quantities and consequently any surviving examples of this variety are exceedingly rare and valuable today.|$|E
25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified that she would have to tell him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E

It {{begins with the}} performance of [...] "Umbrella" [...] at the Manchester show when the scenes are intercut with Rihanna talking about how her fans are coming to watch her on the tour concerts. Other scenes of Rihanna and her crew members, dancers and band are also shown backstage. Rihanna then continues with the interview telling about how she went to some places that she never heard in her life including Ischgl and Sofia. She also explains how flying in private jet with her team like [...] "one family" [...] is fun, but very rare. Scenes of Rihanna performing a show in Ischgl and having snowball fight with hear team at the town's streets are shown. During the interview Rihanna explains that she, her crew members and dancers were touring for a considerable amount of time and became very close so as a result of that, they hang out a lot. One of the crew explains: [...] "It is like a family. Rihanna comes <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> says hi to every single one of us.

[...] The Scotsman asserted [...] "Homer would not approve" [...] of the strike by the voice actors. The voice actors were asking for an increase from US$125,000 to $360,000 per episode. The same quote by Homer to Lisa was cited by Michael Schneider in Daily Variety, who wrote: [...] "...insiders note that the actors work just six to seven hours to voice an episode—which would mean $ 360,000 for a day's work, a figure that even Everybody Loves Raymond star Ray Romano doesn't match." ...|$|E

In February 2013, Beyoncé said that Madonna inspired her to take control of her own career.

Despite them being mutually shy, Renji comes back to see her at the station every day after school and quickly becomes friends with her. Renji later learns {{that she has a}} severe case of anterograde amnesia, where she can only remember 13 hours' of memory at a time, aside from the events before the accident that led to her current state, which she can recall perfectly.

2500|$|Marathi {{was widely}} {{used during the}} Sultanate period. Although the rulers were Muslims, the local feudal landlords and the revenue {{collectors}} were Hindus {{and so was the}} majority of the population. Political expediency made it important for the sultans to make use of Marathi. Nevertheless, Marathi in official documents from the era is totally persianised in its vocabulary. The persian influence continues to this day with many persian derived words used <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> speech such as bāg (Garden), kārkhānā (factory), shahar (city), bāzār (market), dukān (shop), hushār (clever), kāḡaḏ (paper), khurchi (chair), jamin (land), jāhirāt (advertisement), and [...] hazār (thousand) [...] Marathi also became language of administration during the Ahmadnagar Sultanate.

A career in politics is closed to him for he has offended the only power that holds the keys." [...] Tocqueville, in contrast to previous political thinkers, argued that a serious problem in political life was not that people were too strong, but that people were [...] "too weak" [...] and felt powerless; the danger is that people felt [...] "swept up in something that they could not control", according to Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville.|$|E
2500|$|The Paris morgue {{was located}} on the Quai de l'Archevêché on the Île de la Cité, {{not far from the}} Cathedral of Notre-Dame-de-Paris. [...] In order to assist with the {{identification}} of unclaimed bodies, it was open to the public. Bodies fished out of the Seine were put on display behind a large glass window along with the clothes that they had been wearing. A doctor working at the morgue wrote, [...] "A multitude of the curious, of all ages, sexes, and social rank, presses <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> sometimes moved and silent, often stirred by horror and disgust, sometimes cynical and turbulent." [...] On June 28, 1867, a body was found without a head, arms and legs, and put on display. [...] The head, arms and legs were found a few days later, the body was identified, and the murderer tracked down and arrested. [...] The system was macabre, but effective; seventy-five percent of the bodies found in the Seine were identified in this way.|$|E
2500|$|Where {{a person}} works at night, {{he or she}} may only do 8 hours in any 24-hour period on average, or simply 8 hours at most if the work is {{classified}} as [...] "hazardous". Moreover, every worker must receive at least 11 consecutive hours of rest in a 24-hour period, and <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> workers must have at least a 20-minute break in any 6 hour period. The most controversial provisions in the working time laws concerns the right to a maximum working week. The labour movement has always bargained for a shorter working week as it increased economic productivity: the concept of a two-day [...] "weekend" [...] arose in the earlier 20th century, while France more recently implemented the right to a 35-hour workweek in 2000. Under the Directive, this EU maximum is 48 hours. The maximum does not apply to anyone who is self-employed or who can set their own hours of work. In Pfeiffer v Deutsches Rotes Kreuz the ECJ emphasised that the rules aim to protect workers who possess less bargaining power and autonomy over the way they do their jobs. Nevertheless, the UK government negotiated to let workers [...] "opt out" [...] of the 48-hour maximum by individually signing an opt out form. Theoretically and legally, a worker may always change his or her mind after having opted out, and has a right to sue the employer for suffering any detriment if they so choose. However, the obvious criticism has been made that the opt-out makes the right fictitious, because in jobs with a [...] "long hours culture", people are socially compelled to do what everyone else does. If the worker has not [...] "opted out", then the 48-hour week is not a rigid maximum, but is taken as an average over 17 weeks. Analogous to the minimum wage rules, [...] "on call" [...] time (where people must make themselves available, but are not necessarily active) is regarded as working time if the workers are bound to remain awake and close to their workplace. This created a significant problem for junior doctors, where in all European countries the culture has typically been that very long hours are expected. The European Court of Justice's decision in Landeshauptstadt Kiel v Jaegar that junior doctors' on call time was working time led a number of countries to exercise the same [...] "opt out" [...] derogation as the UK, though limited to medical practice. The Health and Safety Executive is the UK body charged with enforcing the working time laws, though it has taken a [...] "light touch" [...] approach to enforcement.|$|E
