40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{characterize}} the hospital morbidity of adults {{living in the}} city of Maring&# 225;, PR, Brazil, between 2000 and 2011, focusing on the differential between men and women. METHOD: this descriptive study was developed based on data from the Hospital Information System of the Unified Health System in order to investigate the association between groups of <b>hospitalization</b> <b>causes</b> and the average length of hospitalization per gender, in three-year periods. RESULTS: the main groups of <b>hospitalization</b> <b>causes</b> for men were: mental disorders, lesions and circulatory diseases; and, among women: tumors, circulatory and genitourinary diseases. Mental disorders and lesions, tumors, circulatory and genitourinary diseases were significantly associated with the female and male genders across the study period. Although not significant, the mean length of hospitalization dropped across the four three-year periods, and only showed a significant difference between {{men and women in the}} second triennium. CONCLUSION: differences in the hospital morbidity profile between men and women underline the need for specific health and nursing actions, especially in primary health care, with a view to reducing hospitalizations due to the main groups of causes in the city...|$|E

40|$|OBJETIVOS: analisar o perfil de morbidade hospitalar de crianças indígenas atendidas na rede de serviços do Sistema Único de Saúde. MÉTODOS: Foram investigados 380 registros de internação hospitalar de crianças indígenas Suruí menores de 10 anos de idade atendidas na rede hospitalar do município de Cacoal, Rondônia, a partir de dados coletados no Hospital Materno-Infantil, instituição pública, e no Hospital Infantil e Maternidade Menino Jesus, instituição particular, no período de 2000 a 2004. Esses dois hospitais concentram o atendimento a indígenas no município. Utilizou-se a Classificação Internacional de Doenças (CID), 10. ª revisão, para a classificação dos diagnósticos. RESULTADOS: as doenças do aparelho respiratório - Cap. X (58, 2 %) figuraram como o {{principal}} motivo de internação hospitalar. Doenças infecciosas e parasitárias (Cap I) apresentaram-se como a segunda maior causa (35, 0 %) e afecções originadas no período perinatal (Cap XVI) como a terceira (3, 2 %). Outras causas contribuíram individualmente com menos de 1, 5 % do total, que somadas não atingiram 4 %. A maioria das internações (65, 5 %) foram de crianças OBJECTIVES: {{to analyze}} the pattern of hospital morbidity of Suruí Indian children at the local network of the Brazilian Universal Health System. METHODS: inpatient data were obtained for 380 children < 10 years old hospitalized during 2000 to 2004 at the two hospitals {{in the city of}} Cacoal, State of Rondônia, to which Indian patients are referred to Hospital Materno-Infantil (public) and Hospital Infantil e Maternidade Menino Jesus (private). <b>Hospitalization</b> <b>causes</b> were classified according to the International Disease Classification 10 th revision. RESULTS: diseases of the respiratory system - Chapter X (58. 2 %) were the most frequent cause of hospitalization, followed by certain infectious and parasitic diseases - Chapter I (35. 0 %) and other conditions developed in the perinatal period - Chapter XVI (3. 2 %). All other causes contributed with less that 1. 5 % {{of the total number of}} admissions, totaling less than 4. 0 % combined. The majority of hospital admissions (65. 5 %) were observed in children < 2 years old. The average number of hospitalization days was significantly higher in public hospital. CONCLUSIONS: the hospital morbidity pattern observed in Suruí children not only discloses their precarious health conditions, but it also points to structural deficiencies at the primary healthcare level. The authors understand that more research is needed to better grasp the epidemiologic background associated with <b>hospitalization</b> <b>causes</b> in Indigenous populations.

40|$|Effective drug therapies are {{available}} {{for a wide range}} of chronic medical conditions but adherence to medications is currently low with poor health outcomes. Evidences support that drug nonadherence is a universal problem more than a disease- and drug-specific problem. Although several methods have been proposed for the assessment of adherence, accurate measurement continues to be difficult and most studies produced inconsistent results on determinants of nonadherence. Osteoporosis is a chronic, asymptomatic illness before fracture, and poor adherence with antiresorptive medications is a significant problem in preventing its adverse consequences. Currently approved therapies for osteoporosis are effective and lower fracture risk, but about 50 % of patients discontinues treatment within 12 months of initiation. Poor adherence has been associated with increased fracture risk and increased resource use and <b>hospitalization.</b> <b>Causes</b> of nonadherence to osteoporosis therapies are unknown. Some variables predictive of nonadherence have been found (older age, comorbidity, previous fractures, bone mineral density assessment, number of medications, institutionalisation) but explain only a small proportion of the variability of adherence. Patients may fail to remain on their medication for reasons that include inconvenience or complexity of dosing, high cost, side effects and lack of appreciation of the benefits of therapy. Potential solutions of poor adherence of osteoporosis may include a close monitoring of persistence and compliance, an improved relationship between physician and patient, and newer medications with extended dosing intervals...|$|E
40|$|We empirically {{examine how}} the {{decision}} to purchase private health insurance and hospitalization are made based on labor income, socio-demographic factors, and private health insurance. The increase in household labor income and wealth has {{a positive effect on}} purchasing private health insurance. This suggests a supplementary effect for public health insurance under the strict control of a two-tier healthcare coverage system. Our results support the hypothesis that moral hazard presents for the costs paid to private health insurance by households. A strong positive association with the risk of <b>hospitalization</b> <b>causes</b> individuals to change their health behavior after purchasing private health insurance leading to lower costs in the ill health status and acquire less preventive measures. Thus, moral hazard exists in Japanese health insurance market. Unlike the previous study, adverse selection based on our results is not negligible in the case of hospitalization in Japan. The positive effect indicates that the higher the risk of illness with households, the more insurance policies a household possesses. The results support our hypotheses that the decision to purchase health insurance in case of death in an insured household in a hospital is attributed to the initial health stock of the household. This means that households purchase private health insurance when there is a high probability of hospitalization with claimed insurance on death. The benefits from private health insurance policies for hospitalization provide incentives for individuals to purchase health insurance that are a reflection of adverse selection against private health insurance...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Heart {{failure is}} {{currently}} {{one of the}} most common <b>hospitalization</b> <b>causes.</b> Several chronic circulatory assist devices have been tested and are highly complex. The objective is the description of a pulsatile endoprosthesis capable of applying a chronic pulse within the descending aorta, similar to that produced by intra-aortic balloon. Methods: Pulsatile stents composed of nickel-titanium were built and positioned to engage latex tubes simulating the aorta. Different electric currents were applied to units connected in series in order to cause structure contraction and displacement of a liquid column. There were two sequence tests: first composed of two metallic cages and the second composed of five cages. At first sequence tests was applied a voltage of 16. 3 volts and a current of 5 amperes. In the second, voltage of 15 volts and current of 07 amperes. Results: In the first sequence was obtained the pulsatile effect of stent, with contraction of the tube and displacement of the water column sufficient to validate the pulsating effect of the endoprosthesis. The two structures ejected a volume of 2. 6 ml per cycle, with a range of 29 mm in height of the column of water equivalent to 8 % shrinkage during the pulse. In the second sequence, it reachead a variation of 7. 4 mL per cycle. Conclusion: The results obtained confirm the stent pulsatile contractility activated by electrical current. The continuity of the study and material improvement are necessary to obtain more efficient model from the point of view of energy and pulse, to allow ejection volumes comparable with the intra-aortic balloons...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. We {{assessed}} {{the costs of}} hospital admissions and length of hospital stay in kidney allograft recipients admitted to our center, in order to rank <b>hospitalization</b> <b>causes</b> in terms of costly and prolonged admissions, to bring to light the respective correlates of costly and prolonged admissions, and to investigate the relationship between costs and length of rehospitalizations. Materials and Methods. In a retrospective study at Baqyiatallah Hospital, in Tehran, records of 358 posttransplant hospitalizations were reviewed for the costs and duration of hospital stay. The causes of rehospitalizations, relative frequency of prolonged stays in costly rehospitalizations, and also relative frequency of costly admissions in short and prolonged stays were evaluated. Results. Among rehospitalizations, 83. 3 % of those due to cerebrovascular accident were costly and 51 % of those with graft rejection resulted in prolonged hospital stays. Costly admissions had a high regularity in cases of patients older than 60 years, end-stage renal disease due to diabetes mellitus, graft loss, intensive care unit admission, and hospitalizations accompanied by in death. Prolonged stays were more common in those who were admitted to intensive care unit and those who ultimately died. The Costs showed a significant correlation with the length of rehospitalization (r = 0. 626, P =. 001). Conclusions. The strong correlation between the length of hospitalization and posttransplant hospitalization costs means that the former should be curtailed by focusing on such correlates of high-cost admissions as high age and diabetes mellitus {{as the cause of}} kidney failure. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND The {{burden of}} heart failure (HF) is {{enormous}} and its prevalence increases sharply with age. It {{has been estimated that}} heart failure affects up to 3 % of the general population and 10 % of the elderly. It contributes to hospital admission for most of them, mainly elder adults (admitted in internal medicine units) with more than one comorbidity, cognitive disorders, impairment and so on. Despite the increasing prevalence {{of heart failure}}, its exact incidence and prevalence remain largely unknown and probably underestimated {{due to a lack of}} accurate epidemiological data and difficulties associated with comorbidities and correct diagnosis: over 40 % of recurrent <b>hospitalization</b> <b>causes,</b> either cardiac or extracardiac, cannot be determined due to the lack of data. AIM OF THE STUDY The objective of this study estimated the prevalence and the primary care burden associated with comorbidities in internal medicine units. METHOD The design: a longitudinal multicentric observational study using spot analysis three data sheets were filled in during the hospital stay according to three crucial moments: enrolment (“the index day”), admission and discharge. Will be analyzed the following primary outcomes: total and cardiovascular mortality, intensive unit care admission, recurrent cardiovascular disorders, length of stay, hospital readmission, changes in activities of daily living, need for care. Second outcomes: clinical, therapeutic, instrumental and laboratory changes during the admission process. Deep analysis of the following comorbidities will be also taken into account: acute and chronic kidney failure, anaemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, muscle loss, nutritional status, cirrhosis of the liver, neoplasms, blood cell disorders, chronic inflammatory diseases.

The practice of sugarcane straw burning to easy the harvest procedure causes the emission to the atmosphere of particulate material, greenhouse gases and tropospheric ozone precursors with negative impacts, particularly, in occurrence of respiratory tract diseases. Although there are environmental policies to eliminate the pre-harvest burning practice in Brazil before 2020, the effectiveness of this regulation is still questionable and the environmental damage during the harvest period is significant.

Each of these {{processes}} could potentially involve clinically significant genetic variants (Touw, 1997). Over the past decades, pharmacogenetic studies have identified numerous genetic variants via GWAS (Spear et al., 2001). For instance, the toxicity of CPT- 11 discussed above is not only linked to the gut microbiome (Stein et al., 2010) but also to genetic variants in the UGT 1 A 1 gene. Around ~ 10 % of the western population carries a genetic variant in UGT 1 A 1 that leads to poor drug metabolism and results in a higher risk for severe toxicity (Innocenti et al., 2004).

Furthermore, as the patient did not receive proper treatment for P. falciparum and hospitalization occurred soon after drug treatment, it seems that P. falciparum pathology was modulated by the concurrent presence of P. vivax.

We estimated outbreak-related illnesses and <b>hospitalizations</b> <b>caused</b> by the consumption of cow's milk and cheese contaminated with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Campylobacter spp. using a model relying on publicly available outbreak data. In the United States, outbreaks associated with dairy consumption cause, on average, 760 illnesses/year and 22 hospitalizations/year, mostly from Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. Unpasteurized milk, consumed by only 3. 2 % of the population, and cheese, consumed by only 1. 6 % of the population, caused 96 % of illnesses caused by contaminated dairy products. Unpasteurized dairy products thus cause 840 (95 % CrI 611 - 1, 158) times more illnesses and 45 (95 % CrI 34 - 59) times more hospitalizations than pasteurized products.

Nosocomial infections in animal hospitals can infect other animals, as well as be transmitted to human personnel. Enterobacter is a genus of common gram-negative bacteria, which {{can be associated with}} antibiotic resistant hospital infections. Because of an outbreak in antibiotic resistance in the genus, we decided to investigate five years of Enterobacter infections in the Large Animal Services of the Lois Bates Acheson Veterinary Teaching Hospital (LBAVTH) at Oregon State Uni-versity. The demographics from 37 Enterobacter-infected patients of the LBAVTH were obtained from charts and ana-lyzed. The identified clusters of infections suggested possible patient-environment sources of infection. The environ-ment of the hospital was sampled in an attempt to determine the source of infection. Although Enterobacter was not isolated, three of the collected samples contained bacteria with resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. Entero-bacter isolates from six of the 37 patients were further analyzed for presence of specific ESBL resistance genes. All six of the isolates harbored multiple extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes, i. e., CTX-M- 15, TEM- 80, SHV- 2 and AmpC. In summary, Enterobacter infection in the veterinary hospital was caused by beta-lactam-resistant strains, carrying ESBL-resistant genes. Veterinary hospital personnel {{should be aware of the}} potential for transmission, to both human...|$|R
40|$|Aim: {{the aim of}} {{the study}} was to reduce the number of hospitalizations in a {{population}} of children enrolled in the Einstein Program of the Paraisopolis Community, in São Paulo, Brazil, particularly <b>hospitalizations</b> <b>caused</b> by respiratory diseases. Methods: All hospitalizations of this paediatric population enrolled in the Einstein Program of the Paraisopolis Community Outpatient Clinic were followed up between 2002 and 2004. the following four strategies to reduce or control respiratory diseases with an impact on hospitalizations were established: specific protocol, educational activities, vaccination against pneumococci and vaccination against influenza. Results: in 2002, 1025 hospitalizations due to all causes were recorded. This number significantly decreased to 862 hospitalizations in 2004 after implementation of the program, corresponding to a reduction of 15. 9 % (p < 0. 0001). Hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases decreased by 23. 37 % (p < 0. 02), and those due to cases of wheezing bronchitis fell by 51. 61 % (p < 0. 001). Conclusion: the strategies chosen and implemented in the Einstein Program of the Paraisopolis Community Outpatient Clinic over the first 6 months of 2003 were effective in reducing the number of children's hospital admissions due to respiratory disease.
