5|$|The {{family had}} reached a {{significant}} position within their community: Ștefan sin Petre had made a steady income from his itinerant trade in wool, while his wife was the descendant of the Creangăs of Pipirig, a family of community leaders. The latter's members included Moldavian Metropolitan Iacob Stamati, as well as Smaranda's father, Vornic David, and her uncle Ciubuc Clopotarul, a monk at Neamț Monastery. Proud of this tradition, it was <b>her</b> <b>who</b> insisted for her son {{to pursue a career}} in the Church. According to his own recollection, the future writer was born on March 1, 1837—a date which has since been challenged. Creangă's other statements mention March 2, 1837, or an unknown date in 1836. The exactitude of other accounts is equally unreliable: community registers from the period gave the date of June 10, 1839, and mention another child of the same name being born to his parents on February 4, 1842 (the more probable birth date of Creangă's younger brother Zahei). The imprecision also touches other aspects of his family life: noting the resulting conflicts in data, Călinescu decided that it was not possible for one to know if the writer's parents were married to each other (and, if so, if they were on their first marriage), nor how many children they had together. At a time when family names were not legally required, and people were primarily known by various nicknames and patronymics, the boy was known to the community as Nică, a hypocorism formed from Ion, or more formally as Nică al lui Ștefan a Petrei ("Nică of Ștefan of Petru", occasionally Nic-a lui Ștefan a Petrei).|$|E
5|$|Whitney {{decides to}} give Lee another chance on the {{condition}} that he will never assault her again, therefore he should seek anger management therapy. Lee gratefully accepts for the sake of their marriage. However, on Valentine's Day, Lee leaves Whitney, leaving a handwritten note on their bed saying he no longer loves her. He returns the following day, apologising to Whitney for his actions and tells her of his plans to move to Dover. An upset Whitney, realising that Lee plans to leave on his own to figure himself out, tells him to leave and she watches him from the window as he drives off. Whitney becomes closer to Mick in Linda's absence and is warned by Shirley to stay away from him. When Mick leaves to look after Nancy when she is hit by a car Whitney is left in charge of running the pub. She later steals Vincent Hubbard's (Richard Blackwood) credit card to pay for a dog pen for Lady Di (Hot Lips), as the Carters cannot afford it due to their debts. Whitney later grows close to new bar manager Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan). Lee attempts to call Whitney but Woody tells Lee that she does not want to speak to him, so Lee sends his friend Moose (Sam Gittins) to see <b>her,</b> <b>who</b> says that Lee wants a divorce. Whitney receives a letter from Lee's solicitor, citing her unreasonable behaviour as grounds for the divorce, but Woody tells her it is not a big deal. Whitney declares that she is going to move on with her life and goes out shopping, but Woody sees she has not taken her purse and goes to give it to her. Whitney is caught shoplifting by a security guard, who offers her sex in exchange for not calling the police. Woody arrives and punches the guard, and takes Whitney home. Whitney and Woody kiss and have sex, and then a returning Mick finds them in bed together. Mick finds more items that Whitney has shoplifted, and she says she should never have married Lee as she is damaged and only good for sex but he tells her she is wrong and promises not to leave again. Mick lashes out at Whitney after learning that Linda and Shirley sold the freehold of the Vic without his knowledge to pay for an operation for Lady Di. A few days later, Whitney is depressed and vulnerable and, when Mick kisses her, she responds. When Shirley finds out about the kiss, she orders Whitney to get out, telling her that Mick would never choose her over Linda. Devastated, Whitney leaves Walford.|$|E
