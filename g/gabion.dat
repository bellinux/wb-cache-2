5|$|Since September 2004, the {{official}} {{home of the}} Scottish Parliament has been a new Scottish Parliament Building, in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh. The Scottish Parliament building was designed by Spanish architect Enric Miralles in partnership with local Edinburgh Architecture firm RMJM which was led by Design Principal Tony Kettle. Some of the principal features of the complex include leaf-shaped buildings, a grass-roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and <b>gabion</b> walls formed from the stones of previous buildings. Throughout the building there are many repeated motifs, such as shapes based on Raeburn's Skating Minister. Crow-stepped gables and the upturned boat skylights of the Garden Lobby, complete the unique architecture. Queen Elizabeth II opened the new building on 9 October 2004.|$|E

This recommendation would preclude the use of <b>gabions</b> to improve fish passage at waterfalls. Also, <b>gabions</b> installed below culverts should be placed well downstream of the culvert.

Near Elm Street in Scranton, the stream flows through a ravine with a depth of [...] In this ravine, the stream flows through the remains of an open channel.

Other components of the project include a debris basin and a stilling basin. This project alleviates flooding from near US Route 11 [...] downstream to near South Washington Avenue. In some reaches, the stream is entirely underground. On a reach of the stream in or near Scranton, 90 percent of it is on an impervious surface.|$|E
500|$|The Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck {{stationed}} a lifeboat at Portland in 1826, {{which was}} withdrawn in 1851. Coastal flooding has affected Portland's residents and transport for centuries—the only {{way off the}} island by land is along the causeway {{in the lee of}} Chesil Beach. At times of extreme floods (about every 10 years) this road link is cut by floods. The low-lying village of Chiswell used to flood on average every 5 years. Chesil Beach occasionally faces severe storms and massive waves, which have a fetch across the Atlantic Ocean. Following two severe flood events in the 1970s, Weymouth and Portland Borough Council and Wessex Water decided to investigate the structure of the beach, and coastal management schemes that could be built to protect Chiswell and the beach road. In the 1980s it was agreed that a scheme to protect against a one-in-five-year storm would be practicable; it would reduce flood depth and duration in more severe storms. Hard engineering techniques were employed in the scheme, including a <b>gabion</b> running [...] to the north of Chiswell, an extended sea wall in Chesil Cove, and a culvert running from inside the beach, underneath the beach road and into Portland Harbour, to divert flood water away from low-lying areas.|$|E

Examples of areas within a FOB that make extensive use of <b>gabions</b> are sleeping quarters, mess halls, or any place where {{there would be a}} large concentration of unprotected soldiers. <b>Gabions</b> are also used for aircraft revetments, blast walls, and similar structures.|$|R
500|$|One {{serious threat}} {{to the future of the}} Head is erosion of the exposed {{southern}} cliff face from wind and rain, as well as erosion caused by the sea primarily through the process of Longshore drift. A comparison of Ordnance Survey maps reveals that 25 metres of cliff was washed away from 1915 to 1962, a process accelerated by the Bournemouth cliff's concreted promenade and groynes, construction of which started in the early 20th century. It is thought that in the last 200 years around 150 metres of land has been lost from the head. The first attempt to counteract erosion came in the 1930s when Bournemouth Council constructed a breakwater now known as [...] "the Long Groyne". Since then, a <b>gabion</b> revetment has been constructed to secure the weakest point at the eastern end of the Head. In a long-term project to secure the head's future, from 2005 to 2008 Poole Bay was replenished with 1.8 million cubic metres of beach material, drawing ire from some surfers and beach lovers owing to the increase in sharp stones on Southbourne beach in particular. The project's organizers, the Poole Bay Partnership, state that: [...] "The resulting wide beaches have been a success in terms of their function as a coast protection structure and for the enjoyment they provide to the area's residents and visitors." ...|$|E

60|$|The <b>gabion</b> was ours. After two hours' {{fighting}} we were {{in possession}} of the first embrasure, and made ourselves as comfortable as circumstances would admit. Jack Delamere, Tom Delancy, Jerry Blake, the Doctor, and myself, sat down under a pontoon, and our servants laid out a hasty supper on a tumbrel. Though Cambaceres had escaped me so provokingly after I cut him down, his spoils were mine; a cold fowl and a Bologna sausage {{were found in the}} Marshal's holsters; and in the haversack of a French private who lay a corpse on the glacis, we found a loaf of bread, his three days' ration. Instead of salt, we had gunpowder; and you may be sure, wherever the Doctor was, a flask of good brandy was behind him in his instrument-case. We sat down and made a soldier's supper. The Doctor pulled a few of the delicious fruit from the lemon-trees growing near (and round which the Carabineers and the 24th Leger had made a desperate rally), and punch was brewed in Jack Delamere's helmet.|$|E
