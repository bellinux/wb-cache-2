40|$|This thesis aims {{to judge}} the {{serviceability}} of the Angloamerican institutes of due diligence {{in the context of}} the European continental legal system, specifically {{in the context of the}} Czech legal system, in connection with selling business. The first part defines the term due diligence, describes the evolution of due diligence during time, distinguishes its different meanings and shows the content of the term. Furthermore, it introduces its division and particular types. The following parts deal with the legal regulation of the Purchase of Business Agreement and its <b>essential</b> <b>procedural</b> <b>requirements.</b> In the conclusion, the possible problems on which it is appropriate to focus on are mentioned...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlthough Workplace Risk Assessments (WRA) {{are legally}} {{required}} in all EU member states and widely {{considered to be}} a core element of occupational safety and health (OSH) management, the state of their implementation at company level is still viewed rather critically, both in quantitative and qualitative terms. In this study, data from a representative company survey (N= 6500) were used to estimate the frequency of different patterns (and corresponding quality levels) of WRA practice in Germany and to determine organisational factors influencing the chance of occurence of these WRA patterns. Results show that only one out of four companies carry out WRAs which not only meet the <b>essential</b> <b>procedural</b> <b>requirements</b> but also take account of potential risk areas in a fairly comprehensive manner. Multinomial logistic regression analysis further revealed that company size is by far the strongest predictor of WRA activity, especially of its more developed forms. Availability of safety specialist assistance, availability of occupational health specialist assistance, affiliation to the production sector, presence of an employee representative body and a good economic situation of the company were each associated with WRA activity as well. The still considerable deficiencies in WRA coverage and quality indicated by this study clearly call for an intensification of WRA-related control and advisory efforts by the OSH authorities, primarily in small companies and in the private services sector. Findings also suggest that reinforcement of worker representation structures at company level and strengthening professional OSH expert utilisation would be beneficial for WRA implementation...|$|E

40|$|<b>Procedural</b> <b>requirements</b> {{of civil}} {{proceedings}} The court must meet special requirements regulated by civil {{procedure in order}} to issue a judgment in civil proceedings. These <b>requirements</b> are called <b>procedural</b> <b>requirements</b> of civil proceedings. If {{they have not been}} met the court must not issue a judgment. <b>Procedural</b> <b>requirements</b> are not enumerated in the Civil Procedure Act. They are created by the theory of civil procedure and by judicial decisions. The first three chapters of the diploma thesis deal with the institute of <b>procedural</b> <b>requirements</b> in general. It is emphasised their role in civil proceedings, analysed legal regulation of the institute and introduced ways of their examination and remedying possible imperfections. Literature is the main source of information in this theoretical part of the thesis. Following chapters are focused on analysis of particular <b>procedural</b> <b>requirements.</b> All requirements are very important and each requirement could be a separate object of research so the diploma thesis concentrates only on defining their function. The thesis also presents methods of determining whether particular <b>procedural</b> <b>requirement</b> has been met and mentions possible ways of remedying imperfections in <b>procedural</b> <b>requirements.</b> Theoretical knowledge acquired in the general part of the thesis is [...] ...|$|R
