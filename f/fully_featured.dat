25|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the device was initially skeptical, with some reviewers, such as then New York Times technology columnist David Pogue, unfavorably comparing the value proposition of Chromebooks with that of more <b>fully</b> <b>featured</b> laptops running the Microsoft Windows operating system. That complaint dissipated later in reviews of machines from Acer and Samsung that were priced lower.|$|E
25|$|The Apple Pippin {{platform}} {{was based}} on the PowerPC Platform, a platform designed and supported by IBM and Apple. The PowerPC 603 processor is based on RISC design, thereby allowing peripherals to rely on the Pippin CPU. For example, instead of relying on a <b>fully</b> <b>featured</b> analog modem, the Pippin has a GeoPort serial port. Various dialup Internet service providers (ISP)—including Prodigy, America On-Line, and eWorld—were supported by the Pippin platform, as well as generic ISPs.|$|E

25|$|The {{lighting}} controller {{is connected to}} the dimmers (or directly to automated luminaires) using a control cable or wireless link (e.g. DMX512) or network, allowing the dimmers which are bulky, hot and sometimes noisy, to be positioned away from the stage and audience and allowing automated luminaires to be positioned wherever necessary. In addition to DMX512, newer control connections include RDM (remote device management) which adds management and status feedback capabilities to devices which use it while maintaining compatibility with DMX512; and Architecture for Control Networks (ACN) which is a <b>fully</b> <b>featured</b> multiple controller networking protocol. These allow the possibility of feedback of position, state or fault conditions from units, whilst allowing much more detailed control of them.|$|E
25|$|The {{operating}} {{system is not}} located in the Pippin's onboard storage, and is instead located on the CD-ROMs {{for each of the}} Pippin's software releases. Apple could thus upgrade the {{operating system}} without having to sell new hardware to the consumer. However, because of this, once Pippin software releases ended, it became impossible to upgrade to a later operating system, or install extensions and such. The system automatically reboots whenever the CD-ROM eject button is pushed, so a user can not load the system software off one CD-ROM, and then insert another CD-ROM. Apple intended for the Pippin platform to be an appliance, and encouraged consumers to purchase a <b>fully</b> <b>featured</b> Macintosh system if they were looking for something upgradable. Bandai never upgraded its system software beyond the 7.5.2 version. Hardware enthusiasts have been able to run system software as late as Mac OS 8.0, but this can only be done on a system utilizing a developer ROM-BIOS.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, <b>fully</b> <b>featured</b> 3-D digital planetaria have added an extra {{degree of freedom}} to a {{presenter}} giving a show because they allow simulation of the view from any point in space, not only the earth-bound view which we are most familiar with. This new virtual reality capability to travel through the universe provides important educational benefits because it vividly conveys that space has depth, helping audiences to leave behind the ancient misconception that the stars are stuck {{on the inside of}} a giant celestial sphere and instead to understand the true layout of the solar system and beyond. For example, a planetarium can now 'fly' the audience towards one of the familiar constellations such as Orion, revealing that the stars which appear to make up a co-ordinated shape from our earth-bound viewpoint are at vastly different distances from Earth and so not connected, except in human imagination and mythology. For especially visual or spatially aware people, this experience can be more educationally beneficial than other demonstrations.|$|E

25|$|Also {{under the}} Piapro brand is Crypton's Piapro Studio, a Vocaloid vocal editor {{implemented}} as a VST/AU plugin bundled {{with all of}} their full V3 Vocaloid products (Miku V3, Miku V3 English, Miku V3 Bundle, Meiko V3, Kaito V3). This allows for full vocal editing functionality nearly identical in feature support to Yamaha's full Vocaloid 3 Editor software, which is available as either a standalone application or a plugin for Cubase. All Vocaloid 3 voice libraries include the Tiny Vocaloid 3 Editor for free, however this is quite severely limited in functionality compared to the full V3 editor, being limited to just 17 bars of output, along with some other limitations - serving mainly as a beginner's taste of Vocaloid editing or a way to easily test out a new vocal library. Piapro Studio was created to allow owners of Crypton's V3 products to have a <b>fully</b> <b>featured</b> vocal editor with a modernized and streamlined interface bundled free of charge. It also allows for the loading of 3rd-party, non-Crypton Vocaloid 3 voicebanks - as well as V2's that have been imported into the full V3 editor beforehand. Being a VST plugin, it allows the user to operate entirely within their DAW of choice, {{in contrast to the}} tiny or full V3 editors which are standalone applications and the user must export a wav to import into their DAW each time a change or update is needed - or export an updated wav file from their DAW as the background music to import into the V3 editor. This integration of the vocal editing within the DAW as a VST instrument plugin allows for convenient editing and a smoother workflow. Currently Piapro Studio is lacking some features of the full V3 editor, but most of these are not needed to work with the vocal composition and tuning of the Vocaloid, instead currently some convenience and expansion features such as WAV import and Vocaloid 3's Job Plugins (a scripting system), are absent from Piapro Studio. Crypton has however has mentioned they would like to implement something similar to Job Plugins {{at some point in the}} future. Piapro Studio is also regularly updated every few months with new features and bug fixes. Vocaloid 3 Editor updates appear much less frequently, generally only around the time of release of a new Vocaloid. Piapro Studio also features some Piapro social designed singer icons and vocal preview samples, added in an update in the Summer of 2014.|$|E
500|$|Empires was {{received}} positively by critics, according to review aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings. The game's sales, {{when combined with}} those of Empire Earth, surpassed 2.5 million units by May 2004. Game Informers Adam Biessener called Empires [...] "a good knockoff" [...] of WarCraft III and Age of Mythology, worthwhile for fans of the RTS genre. He praised its Empire Builder and Action modes, and the uniqueness of its multiplayer mode; but he found its single-player campaigns to be lackluster. Jonah Jackson of X-Play, Ron Dulin of Computer Gaming World and Stephen Poole of PC Gamer US were similarly unimpressed by the game's single-player mode: the last critic highlighted its [...] "stupendously loquacious cut-scenes and terrible voice-acting". However, Poole dubbed Empires a strong, streamlined and <b>fully</b> <b>featured</b> multiplayer game, which he recommended despite its flaws and lack of innovation. Jackson lauded the multiplayer component as well, and he believed that, while the game at first seems unoriginal, Empires is [...] "the most mature and well-balanced of Goodman's titles".|$|E

2500|$|Michael Huber of GameTrailers {{called it}} a [...] "superb entry in the franchise", noting the gameplay, story mode and new online components. Vince Ingenito of IGN gave it a score of 8.4.

He also praised {{the presence of the}} new characters as the major roster shakeup made the game feel new and exciting to longtime series fans and casual fans. Michael McWhertor of Polygon called the game [...] "one of the best fighting games in the series", praising the gameplay in addition to the newer systems in place and overall presentation. Stephen Kleckner of VentureBeat was more critical of the game, citing in his opinion confusing move animations, a system favoring close range mid-to-high combos, having to use the block button to execute a run, poor online play, and easy Fatality DLC. He also mentioned an issue where save data would be erased due to a bug in the PC version. Matt Elliott of PC Gamer had mixed feelings about the online gameplay and said that [...] "Mortal Kombat online simply isn't sturdy enough to remain competitive".|$|E
2500|$|Bluehole used closed alpha and beta periods {{with about}} 80,000 players, {{including}} popular streamers, to gauge initial {{reaction to the}} gameplay and adjust balance prior to a wider release. The early access phase on Steam began in March 2017 for the Windows version. This early access period was planned to last approximately six months, originally aiming for a September 2017 release. In July 2017, Greene announced that {{they would need to}} extend the early access period by a few months, continuing to release updates on a regular basis, with plans to still release by the end of 2017, as committing to this original period [...] "could hinder us from delivering a <b>fully</b> <b>featured</b> game and/or lead to disappointment within the community if the launch deadline is not met". Initially, Bluehole had expected that they would just gain enough players through early access to smooth out the gameplay, and only when the game was completed, they would have started more marketing for the title. The sudden interest in the game from early access exceeded their expectations, and put emphasis on the stability of the game and its underlying networking alongside gameplay improvements. Through August 2017, these updates generally included a major weekly patch alongside major monthly updates that provided key performance improvements. However, from August onward Bluehole backed off the rate of such patches, as the high frequency has led to some quality control issues, and the developers rather make sure each patch content is well-vetted by the community before providing new updates; this did not change their plans for a 2017 release. Bluehold anticipated to leave the early access period by late December 2017.|$|E

40|$|Oil spill {{accidents}} from ship or {{oil platform}} cause damage to marine and coastal environment and ecosystems. To monitor such spill events from space, fully polarimetric (Pol-SAR) {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) has been greatly used in improving oil spill observation. Aiming to promote ocean oil spill classification accuracy, we developed a new oil spill identification method by combining multiple <b>fully</b> polarimetric SAR <b>features</b> data with an optimized wavelet neural network classifier (WNN). Two sets of RADARSAT- 2 fully polarimetric SAR data are applied to test {{the validity of the}} developed method. The experimental results show that: (1) the convergence ability of optimized WNN can be enhanced, improving overall classification accuracy of ocean oil spill, in comparison to the classification results based on a common un-optimized WNN classifier; and (2) the joint use of the multiple <b>fully</b> Pol-SAR <b>features</b> as the inputs of the classifier can achieve better classification result than that only with single <b>fully</b> Pol-SAR <b>feature.</b> The developed method can improve classification accuracy by 4. 96 % and 7. 75 %, compared with the classification results with un-optimized WNN and only with one single <b>fully</b> polarimetric SAR <b>feature.</b> The classification overall accuracy based on the proposed approach can reach 97. 67 %.
