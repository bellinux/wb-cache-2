5|$|Uranian Worlds, by Eric Garber and Lyn Paleo, was {{compiled}} in 1983 {{and is an}} authoritative guide to science fiction literature featuring gay, lesbian, transgender, and related themes. The book covers science fiction literature published before 1990 (2nd edition, 1990), providing a short review and commentary on <b>each</b> <b>piece.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the New Kingdom, a {{tradition}} had developed that Set had cut Osiris's body into pieces and scattered them across Egypt. Cult centers of Osiris all over the country claimed that the corpse, or particular pieces of it, were found near them. The dismembered parts could be said to number as many as forty-two, <b>each</b> <b>piece</b> being equated with one of the forty-two nomes, or provinces, in Egypt. Thus, the god of kingship becomes the embodiment of his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Music with a fast {{rhythm of}} 120 bpm {{was used in}} an attempt to keep the teams walking quickly around the stadium, and this was {{reinforced}} by the drummers in the stadium; nevertheless the parade part of the programme took 1 hour 40 minutes to complete, compared to the 1 hour 29 minutes estimated in the official media guide. Once all of the athletes were inside the stadium, 7 billion small pieces of paper were dropped from a Westland helicopter, <b>each</b> <b>piece</b> representing one person on Earth.|$|E

5|$|The {{developers}} refreshed Combat Evolveds {{music and}} sound effects {{along with its}} visuals. While players can toggle the original music from Halo: Combat Evolved, the soundtrack was also rerecorded in partnership with Pyramind Studios, using the 75-piece Skywalker Symphony Orchestra and the Chanticleer vocal ensemble. Because there were no MIDI recordings of the original game's music, Paul Lipson, Lennie Moore, Tom Salta, and Brian Trifon transcribed <b>each</b> <b>piece</b> of music.|$|E
5|$|Third dance {{movement}} (Scherzo or minuet) in the tonic, {{in overall}} A–B–A ternary form, with a trio in either ternary or binary form, {{and in a}} conventionally related key (relative major, subdominant, and parallel minor respectively). They are based on their sonata's first movements, with a similar tonal scheme and/or motivic reference. The B section of <b>each</b> <b>piece</b> features tonalities serving important dramatic functions in previous movements. Each features animated, playful figurations for the right hand and abrupt changes in register.|$|E
5|$|As <b>each</b> <b>piece</b> of {{wreckage}} {{was brought}} in, it was carefully cleaned with fresh water, sorted, and weighed. The item was then {{placed in a}} specific area of a hangar at CFB Shearwater, based on a grid system representing the various sections of the plane. All items not considered significant to the crash were stored with similar items in large boxes. When a box was full, it was weighed {{and moved to a}} custom-built temporary structure (J-Hangar) on a discontinued runway for long-term storage. If deemed significant to the investigation, the item was documented, photographed, and kept in the active examination hangar. Particular attention was paid to any item showing heat damage, burns, or other unusual marks.|$|E

5|$|Due to the Famicom's {{restricted}} hardware capabilities, the remake {{is entirely}} two-dimensional. Special compensation {{was made for}} some of the in-battle sprites such as Cloud Strife's, combining two 16x24 pixel sprites side-by-side instead of the usual single sprite to account for weapons such as Cloud's sword or Barret's gun. While most Japanese games use only 8x8-pixel hiragana or katakana fonts, and most Chinese games use 4-color 16x16-pixel tiles stored in dedicated CHR ROM pages, this game uses its own several-hundred 16x16-pixel monochrome font instead. The script itself is strewn in chunks across the code; at the beginning of <b>each</b> <b>piece</b> of text for dialog boxes is a three digit number preceded by an @-symbol, signifying which character portrait to display.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his defeat}} in the Walker Whiskey Trophy events, a number of Rush's admirers and backers held a banquet in his honour, at which they {{presented}} him with an illuminated testimonial along with a sterling silver tea set, salver, and claret jug, valued at £200. These recognised his excellence as a sportsman, and his admirable qualities as a man. The salver was inscribed with a dedication, and <b>each</b> <b>piece</b> bore an inscribed caricature of Rush at the oars of an outrigger skiff. The silver items {{are now in the}} collection of the Clarence River Historical Society in Grafton, New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|That night, the Black Pearl, which Elizabeth {{saw as a}} child, attacks Port Royal {{searching for}} the medallion. The crew of the Black Pearl capture Elizabeth, taking her to meet Captain Barbossa for negotiations. Elizabeth claims her last name is Turner, to conceal her {{identity}} as the governor's daughter, but Barbossa takes her prisoner. Elizabeth learns that after Barbossa's crew took the cursed treasure of Cortés from Isla de Muerta, {{they were forced to}} bear the curse of undeath; they appear as heavily decomposed corpses in moonlight. To lift the curse, they need to return all 882 gold pieces of eight with the blood of the owner of <b>each</b> <b>piece.</b> Elizabeth's medallion is the final piece.|$|E

5|$|The sets {{representing}} the interior {{rooms of the}} Titanic were reproduced exactly as originally built, using photographs and plans from the Titanic builders. The Grand Staircase, which features prominently in the film, was recreated to a high standard of authenticity, though it was widened 30% compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders. Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate paneling and plaster-work based on Titanic's original designs. The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on <b>each</b> <b>piece</b> were among the objects recreated according to original designs. Cameron additionally hired two Titanic historians, Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, to authenticate the historical detail in the film.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Shiva's wife Sati immolated {{herself in}} the yajna-fire of her father Daksha, as a protest against Shiva's dishonor. The God became furious and started to dance the Tāndava with Sati's body on his shoulders. Knowing that the dance of {{destruction}} was about to annihilate the world, Vishnu cut the body of Sati to pieces with Sudarshana Chakram, his celestial weapon, thereby appeasing Shiva. Each of 51 pieces of the body fell to earth, and the place where <b>each</b> <b>piece</b> fell became a holy center of pilgrimage or Shakti Peetha. The legend goes that Sati's right arm fell near a now-extinct hot spring at the Chandranth peak in Sitakunda. The site is marked by the temple of Sambhunath just below the Chandranath temple {{on top of the}} peak, and it is a major tirtha for Hindus in Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the highly}} skilled nature {{required}} for playing the agung, {{it is not uncommon}} to see agung players have friendly rivalries during a performance, using tricks in an attempt to throw others off-beat. For instance, if the p’nanggisa’s elaborations are so elusive that the p’mals has a hard time ornamenting or if the reversed happens and the p’mals ornaments to the point the p’nanggisa’s performance is engulfed, the player that cannot keep up is usually embarrassed, becoming the butt of jokes. Normally agung players switch off after <b>each</b> <b>piece,</b> but during instances like this where one player cannot handle the part being played, players either remain at their gongs or switch during the performance. It is also possible for agung players to switch places with the dabakan after two pieces. Even though the players compete, they still understand they are a single entity, closely accompanying the melody, employ different variations without destroying the music’s basic patterns.|$|E

50|$|The puzzle {{consists}} of 4 corner pieces, 4 edge pieces and 1 centre <b>piece.</b> <b>Each</b> corner <b>piece</b> has four colours <b>each,</b> <b>each</b> edge <b>piece</b> has three colours each, while the centre piece has two colours (on the opposite faces). The puzzle {{can be thought}} of as twisting around its edge <b>pieces</b> - <b>each</b> twist causes one edge piece to rotate 180° in place, and the two adjacent corner pieces to swap positions (while also being rotated).|$|R
5|$|The {{chessboard}} {{on the top}} of {{the cabinet}} was thin enough to allow for a magnetic linkage. <b>Each</b> <b>piece</b> in the chess set had a small, strong magnet attached to its base, and when they were placed on the board the pieces would attract a magnet attached to a string under their specific places on the board. This allowed the director inside the machine to see which pieces moved where on the chess board. The bottom of the chessboard had corresponding numbers, 1–64, allowing the director to see which places on the board were affected by a player's move. The internal magnets were positioned in a way that outside magnetic forces did not influence them, and Kempelen would often allow a large magnet to sit at the side of the board in an attempt to show that the machine was not influenced by magnetism.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} in a detonation level is to plant and detonate explosive devices {{on a number}} of enemy positions, which can consist of anti-aircraft guns, tanks and armored cars. Some positions must be hit twice for them to be destroyed. Players can protect their positions by defusing the explosives before they detonate. In one variation of this game mode, one side has to defend their positions for a set amount of time, with the destruction of <b>each</b> <b>piece</b> of equipment giving the enemy team more time. The defenders win if they can hold their positions long enough for the time to run out, while the attackers win when all objectives have been destroyed. In the alternate version, both teams must attack the other's objectives while defending their own. The first team to destroy all of the enemy's equipment wins.|$|E
5|$|Waraq Dawali (stuffed grape leaves), is a mahshi meal {{reserved}} for large gatherings. The grape leaves are normally wrapped around minced meat, white rice and diced tomatoes, however meat {{is not always}} used. Dawali is an excellent representation of the attention to detail commonly found in Palestinian and Levant cuisine, with <b>each</b> <b>piece</b> being tightly wrapped {{to the size of}} cigarette morsels (some families differ in their structure).It is then cooked and served as dozens of rolls on a large plate usually accompanied by boiled potato slices, carrots and lamb pieces. Kousa mahshi are zucchinis stuffed with the same ingredients as waraq al-'ainib and usually served alongside it heavy meals. If made with a large number of zucchinis as well as dawali it is known as waraq al-'ainib wa kousa.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, {{under the}} urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the {{spending}} of $8 million to study the collection and {{to begin the process}} of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of $66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. Aside from providing concise histories of the equipment, the report also made recommendations as to whether or not <b>each</b> <b>piece</b> belonged in the now government-funded collection. Historical significance to the United States was a criterion of the recommendations. Many of the pieces of equipment that did not meet the report's recommendations were sold or traded for pieces that had historical significance to the DL grounds on which the site is located.|$|E
5|$|Jade burial suit: Burial suits made of jade {{existed in}} China during the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD). Confirming ancient records about Han royalty and nobility buried in jade burial suits, archaeologists {{discovered}} in June 1968 the tombs and jade burial suits of Prince Liu Sheng (d. 113 BC) {{and his wife}} Dou Wan in Hebei province. Liu's suit, in twelve flexible sections, comprised 2,690 square pieces of green jade with holes punctured in {{the four corners of}} <b>each</b> <b>piece</b> so that they could be sewn together with gold thread. The total weight of the gold thread used in his suit was 1,110 g (39oz). Princess Dou Wan's suit had 2,156 pieces of jade stitched together with 703 g (24.7oz) of gold thread. Although jade burial outer wears and head masks appear in tombs of the early Han Dynasty, burial suits did not appear until the reign of Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180–157 BC), with the earliest being found in the Shizishan site. A total of 22 Western Han (202 BC– 9 AD) and 27 Eastern Han (25–220 AD) complete and partial jade burial suits were uncovered between 1954 and 1996. They are found mainly in Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu and Henan, as well as at Yangjiawan, Dongyuan, Guangzhou, Mawangdui, Mianyang and Shizhaishan. The jade burial suit gradually disappeared when it was forbidden in 222 by Emperor Wen of Wei.|$|E
5|$|The main {{technique}} Cage {{used for}} composition {{is that of}} nested proportions: an arbitrary sequence of numbers defines {{the structure of a}} piece on both the macroscopic and the microscopic level, so that the larger parts of <b>each</b> <b>piece</b> are in the same relation to the whole as the smaller parts are to a single unit of it. For instance, the proportion for Sonata III is 1, 1, 3¼, 3¼ (in whole notes), and a unit here is equal to 8½ bars (the end of a unit is marked with a double barline in the score, unless it coincides with the end of a section). The structure of this sonata is AABB. Section A consists of a single unit, composed according to the given proportion: correlation on the microscopic level. A is repeated, and AA forms {{the first part of the}} proportion on the macroscopic level: 1, 1. B consists of three units and an appendix of ¼ of a unit. B is also repeated, and BB gives the second half of the proportion: 3¼, 3¼. Therefore, AABB has proportions 1, 1, 3¼, 3¼: correlation on the macroscopic level. The musical phrases within each unit are also governed by the same proportion. See Example 2 for a graph of the structure of Sonata III.|$|E
