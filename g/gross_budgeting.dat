40|$|A {{sediment}} {{budget of}} Pegasus Bay {{is presented in}} order to build up a comprehensive account of sediment movements and potential shoreline behaviour of the region. The bay has been extensively researched on a local scale but very few works examine the bay as a entire unit. This thesis gives an overview of the bay as a whole as well as examining site specific areas which leads to the derivation of a sediment budget for Pegasus Bay. The principal objective is to establish and quantify the sources, sinks and transfers of sediment within the Pegasus Bay coastal system. This is achieved by establishing annual river yields, estuary and lagoon sedimentation rates; profile volume analysis; longshore transport calculations based on wave observations; and examining sedimentation on the Canterbury Continental Shelf. It is found that the Avon-Heathcote Estuary and Brooklands Lagoon are sinks of sediment, storing 3, 000 m³. yr⁻¹ and 1, 000 m³. yr⁻¹ respectively. The annual river sediment yields are found to be 3, 005, 000 m³. yr⁻¹ with the Waimakariri River contributing 78 %. A predominant southerly component of longshore transport is discovered in the south (281, 000 m³. yr⁻¹) and mid Pegasus Bay (l, 572, 000 m³. yr⁻ ¹) while north Pegasus Bay exhibits net northerly transport (203, 000 m³. yr⁻¹). The onshore/offshore exchange examinations reveal that there is net onshore transport for the bay of 1, 190, 000 m³. yr⁻¹. The <b>gross</b> sediment <b>budget</b> for the region sums to 20, 571, 000 m³. yr⁻¹. The net sediment budget for Pegasus Bay at 5, 843, 000 m³. yr⁻¹ represents 30 % of the <b>gross</b> <b>budget</b> of which rivers are the most significant source contributing 55 % to the net budget. The net budget exhibits a surplus of sediment for the each sector of the bay. This is not reflected in five sectors which are in either an erosionary or equilibrium state. Despite this anomaly a positive correlation between the state of the beach and the amount of surplus for each sector is identified. The relationship is represented by a critical line which marks the point at which a beach may change its state...|$|R

We propose two different approaches to improve the Eurostat/OECD method, based on assumptions of minimum and maximum NUE, and on regressing the N-input and N-output relationship for regions without obvious soil nitrogen stock changes. Our results show that both approaches give reasonable results for all regions, including those for which the Eurostat/OECD method failed.

40|$|Considerable {{volatility}} in the Rand-Dollar {{exchange rate}} {{has been noted}} {{in the years following}} the global financial crisis of 2008 / 2009. Lots of literature exists around the modelling of movements in exchange rates, with much focus on the impact of the announcement of macroeconomic fundamentals. The relationship between different macroeconomic fundamentals and volatility in foreign exchange markets has been studied by measuring the impact of announcement 'surprises', defined as the difference between expected and actual announcements. With much focus on currency rates for developed markets, there are surprisingly few related to emerging market currencies, and even less so for the specific South African context. As such, this paper seeks to investigate the extent to which volatility in the Rand-Dollar exchange rate is a function of surprises in macroeconomic announcements over the period 2010 to 2015. In light of the methodologies employed in literature, together with the data characteristics unique to this research paper, a TARCH model under student-t distribution was employed for analysis. Results of the analysis indicate that surprises in South African macroeconomic announcements of consumer confidence, government <b>budget,</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product, and current account have an influence on volatility in the Rand-Dollar exchange rate. While the model is validated, the macroeconomic announcements considered do not fully explain all volatility observed in the US Dollar Rand exchange rate, highlighting the need for additional studies. Findings of the model demonstrate that surprises in South African (consumer confidence, government <b>budget,</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product, and current account) and US (trade balance) macroeconomic announcements have significance on the daily conditional return and variance of the Rand-Dollar exchange rate. This response is found to be time-varying, with different announcements showing significance at various points in time.

40|$|AbstractTo {{increase}} crop yield, high {{fertilizer application}} rates {{have generally been}} used. The residual fertilizers potentially {{become a source of}} diffused pollution, and degrade soil and water quality. Such nonpoint source pollution is a major threat to reservoir eutrophication. The best management practices (BMPs) are usually used to prevent eutrophication; however, the environmental distribution of the applied fertilizers has not been understood properly. This could lead to a biased assessment of the rational quantity of nitrogen and phosphorous applied and the selection of BMPs. A field investigation of 32 plantations and 4 forests in the Feitsui Reservoir watershed, Taiwan, was conducted. Storm runoff water and soils were sampled, and a mass balance was used to demonstrate the <b>gross</b> nutrient <b>budget.</b> The results showed that when applying fertilizers of 2700  kg ha− 1 in tea plantations only 18. 3 % of applied nitrogen and 5. 5 % of applied phosphorus were utilized by tea plants. Less than 5 % of applied phosphorus was released in storm runoff, and more than 90 % remained in the field. Approximately 30 % of the nitrogen was lost through storm runoff, and 52 % was stored in the soil mass. Therefore, reducing fertilizer application was recommended as the principal BMP, and collecting and treating storm runoff was suggested for controlling nitrogen pollution. The current management of soil erosion is an efficient measure for controlling phosphorus pollution...|$|R
