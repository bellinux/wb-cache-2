40|$|The {{benefits}} of the Department of Energy's research and development (R&D) efforts have historically been estimated under business-as-usual market and policy conditions. In recognition of the insurance value of R&D, however, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) and the Office of Fossil Energy (FE) have been exploring options for evaluating the {{benefits of}} their R&D programs under an array of alternative futures. More specifically, an FE-EERE Scenarios Working Group (the Working Group) has proposed to EERE and FE staff the application of an initial set of three scenarios {{for use in the}} Working Group's upcoming analyses: (1) a Reference Case Scenario, (2) a <b>High</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Price</b> Scenario, which includes heightened natural gas and oil prices, and (3) a Carbon Cap-and-Trade Scenario. The immediate goal is to use these scenarios to conduct a pilot analysis of the benefits of EERE and FE R&D efforts. In this report, the two alternative scenarios being considered by EERE and FE staff [...] carbon cap-and-trade and high fuel prices [...] are compared to other scenarios used by energy analysts and utility planners. The report also briefly evaluates the past accuracy of fossil fuel price forecasts. We find that the natural gas prices through 2025 proposed in the FE-EERE Scenarios Working Group's <b>High</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Price</b> Scenario appear to be reasonable based on current natural gas prices and other externally generated gas price forecasts and scenarios. If anything, an even more extreme gas price scenario might be considered. The price escalation from 2025 to 2050 within the proposed <b>High</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Price</b> Scenario is harder to evaluate, primarily because few existing forecasts or scenarios extend beyond 2025, but, at first blush, it also appears reasonable. Similarly, we find that the oil prices originally proposed by the Working Group in the <b>High</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Price</b> Scenario appear to be reasonable, if not conservative, based on: (1) the current forward market for oil, (2) current oil prices, (3) externally generated oil price forecasts, and (4) the historical difficulty in accurately forecasting oil prices. Overall, a spread between the FE-EERE High Oil Price and Reference scenarios of well over $ 8 /bbl is supported by the literature. We conclude that a wide range of carbon regulation scenarios are possible, especially within the time frame considered by EERE and FE (through 2050). The Working Group's Carbon Cap-and-Trade Scenario is found to be less aggressive than many Kyoto-style targets that have been analyzed, and similar in magnitude to the proposed Climate Stewardship Act. The proposed scenario is more aggressive than some other scenarios found in the literature, however, and ignores carbon banking and offsets and does not allow nuclear power to expand. We are therefore somewhat concerned that the stringency of the proposed carbon regulation scenario in the 2010 to 2025 period will lead to a particularly high estimated cost of carbon reduction. As described in more detail later, we encourage some flexibility in the Working Group's ultimate implementation of the Carbon Cap-and-Trade Scenario. We conclude by identifying additional scenarios that might be considered in future analyses, describing a concern with the proposed specification of the <b>High</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Price</b> Scenario, and highlighting the possible difficulty of implementing extreme scenarios with current energy modeling tools...|$|E

40|$|For {{at least}} the last decade, {{evaluation}} {{of the benefits of}} research, development, demonstration, and deployment (RD 3) by the U. S. Department of Energy has been conducted using deterministic forecasts that unrealistically presume we can precisely foresee our future 10, 25, or even 50 years hence. This effort tries, in a modest way, to begin a process of recognition that the reality of our energy future is rather one rife with uncertainty. The National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) is used by the Department of Energy s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EE) and Fossil Energy (FE) for their RD 3 benefits evaluation. In order to begin scoping out the uncertainty in these deterministic forecasts, EE and FE designed two futures that differ significantly from the basic NEMS forecast. A <b>High</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Price</b> Scenario and a Carbon Cap Scenario were envisioned to forecast alternative futures and the associated benefits. Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) implemented these scenarios into its version of NEMS, NEMS-LBNL, in late 2004, and the Energy Information Agency created six scenarios for FE in early 2005. The creation and implementation of the EE-FE scenarios are explained in this report. Both a Carbon Cap Scenario and a <b>High</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Price</b> Scenarios were implemented into the NEMS-LBNL. EIA subsequently modeled similar scenarios using NEMS. While the EIA and LBNL implementations were in some ways rather different, their forecasts do not significantly diverge. Compared to the Reference Scenario, the <b>High</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Price</b> Scenario reduces energy consumption by 4 percent in 2025, while in the EIA fuel price scenario (known as Scenario 4) reduction from its corresponding reference scenario (known as Scenario 0) in 2025 is marginal. Nonetheless, the 4 percent demand reduction does not lead to other cascading effects that would significantly differentiate the two scenarios. The LBNL and EIA carbon scenarios were mostly identical. The only major difference was that LBNL started working with the AEO 2004 NEMS code and EIA was using AEO 2005 NEMS code. Unlike the High Price Scenario the Carbon Cap scenario gives a radically different forecast than the Reference Scenario. NEMS-LBNL proved that it can handle these alternative scenarios. However, results are price inelastic (for both oil and natural gas prices) within the price range evaluated. Perhaps even higher price paths would lead to a distinctly different forecast than the Reference Scenario. On the other hand, the Carbon Cap Scenario behaves more like an alternative future. The future in the Carbon Cap Scenario has higher electricity prices, reduced driving, more renewable capacity, and reduced energy consumption. The next step for this work is to evaluate the EE benefits under each of the three scenarios. Comparing those three sets of predicted benefits will indicate how much uncertainty is inherent within this sort of deterministic forecasting...|$|E

40|$|The optimal {{integration}} of heat pumps in industrial processes {{has not yet}} been fully understood. In this paper an optimization methodology and a method which uses the composite curves as a guideline to the correct choice of heat pump type are outlined. The selection is done by matching the shape of the composite curves against the specific characteristics of several heat pump types. Furthermore, a methodology for the optimization of the most important parameters in a heat pump system is presented. In the optimization methodology the annual cost is minimized by varying heat source and heat sink temperatures, the heat pump size and the stream or streams to be utilized as heat source and heat sink. To reveal the potential for electrically driven compression heat pumps two different examples were studied with the methodology. The first example had close composite curves and was thought to be a poor heat pump candidate. The second one had open composite curves and was thought to be a promising example. The results showed that for both examples, heat pump installations were advantageous under good economic conditions for the heat pump, i. e. low electricity price, <b>high</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> and low investment costs. Also reasonable payback periods were achieved. With more unfavourable conditions the payback period increased, and in extreme cases a heat pump was no longer a better alternative than pure heat exchange. This decline in potential for heat pumping was much less in the example with open composite curves than in the example with closed ones. However, the conclusion to be drawn is that there exists today a potential for heat pumps in industrial processes...|$|E
40|$|A Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) is {{a policy}} tool that sets a {{requirement}} for retail sellers of electricity to provide a minimum portion of their electricity sales from renewable resources. The RPS at state levels {{has become one of}} the most important policy incentives for stimulating clean energy expansion in electricity utilities in the United States. In 2007, North Carolina promulgated a Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (REPS), requiring the investor-owned utilities (IOUs) to meet up to 12. 5 % of their energy needs through renewable energy resources by 2021. This Master’s Project is designed to evaluate the cost and rate impacts of REPS on three IOUs in North Carolina from the perspective of retail market. Referring to the core modeling approaches and assumptions in the former technical report for North Carolina, this project establishes a cost impact model to compare the total annual cost of the Utilities’ Portfolio and Alternative REPS Portfolio from 2011 to 2030. The project also analyzes the impacts of different sensitivities. The results suggest that the REPS policy exerts no cost impact on IOUs until 2017 and a 0. 54 cents/kWh increase of retail electricity rate will be reached in 2030 under the REPS obligation. According to sensitivity analysis, the extended availability of Production Tax Credit (PTC), <b>high</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> of coal and natural gas, as well as high construction cost of nuclear plant will reduce the total incremental cost of the REPS policy over 20 years.

40|$|Turbofan engines, which {{power the}} {{majority}} of the modern aircraft today, have achieved such a high maturity that small improvements of the engine performance requires a large investment. More innovative technologies, including those related to the engine cores, become increasingly attractive due to the <b>high</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> in recent years as well as the strict regulations on emissions. In this thesis three different innovative core concepts based on alternative cycles are analysed. The first requires introducing an intercooler into a high bypass ratio engine. Intercooling can reduce the high pressure compressor exit temperature and enables a very high overall pressure ratio and thus also high thermal efficiency. The second innovative concept is the intercooled recuperated core. Recuperation can recover energy from the exhausts and improve the engine thermal efficiency. The third innovative concept makes use of a variable core cycle. By adopting a variable core cycle, one can keep the thermal efficiency at a relatively high level during cruise conditions. To analyse and evaluate these concepts, the performance, dimensions and weight of the relevant components have been modelled with empirical correlations, industrial input and with CAD/CFD tools. These component models were integrated into system simulation tools and multidisciplinary optimisation studies were carried out to explore the design space. The potential of the innovative core concepts are evaluated and they demonstrate fuel reduction potential to a varying degree. The complicated interrelationship between the design parameters of these engines has also been analysed. Furthermore, it was found that modification of the engine gas path is necessary due to the influence from the new components. The knowledge accumulated in this thesis helps the engine designers enhance the understanding of these new concepts and select a better approach for future air transport...|$|E

40|$|In the future, the {{technical}} and economic conditions for energy savings in the {{pulp and paper industry}} will change. More excess heat will be available in future mills above 80 °C than in existing mills, increasing the potential for process integration, and governmental actions for reducing CO 2 emissions and the deregulation of electricity markets will change the economic conditions for investments aimed at saving energy. Evaporation plants are some of the largest energy consumers in the pulp and paper industry, but also some of the most flexible unit operations. The objective of this thesis has therefore been to study the possibilities to save energy in future kraft pulp mills by integrating the evaporation plant {{with the rest of the}} process. The emphasis has been on quantifying the energy savings possible and understanding how they are influenced by different parameters on several system levels. Conventionally designed evaporation plants as well as evaporation plants that use excess heat and/or deliver low-pressure steam to the steam network have been simulated for different model mills. Using the simulation results, the energy efficiency and economics for the different designs have been compared at a wide range of conditions. The reductions in CO 2 emissions have also been calculated. The work presented in this thesis has been performed within a Swedish research program called the Eco-cyclic Pulp Mill. The simulation results show that the live steam demand in the evaporation plant can be lowered by 22 - 93 % in the model mills evaluated if the evaporation plant is process integrated. They also show that the greatest reductions are achieved if the evaporation plant is designed to use both MP steam and excess heat. In general, the results from the economic parameter studies show that the process integrated evaporation designs also are interesting from an economic perspective. They are also favored by a low electricity price (unless condensing power is produced) and a <b>high</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>price,</b> since this increases the benefit of saving fuel. It is further concluded that all process integrated designs reduce CO 2 emissions; the size of the reduction, however, depends on how the saved fuel is used and how the marginal electricity production in society is generated...|$|E
40|$|The {{image of}} BMW is very {{strongly}} associated to high power, sports biased, luxury {{cars in the}} premium car segment, however, particularly in the United States and some parts of Asia, {{the combination of a}} car in this segment with a diesel engine was up until now almost unthinkable. I feel sure that many people in the USA are not even aware that BMW produces diesel-powered cars. In Europe there is a completely contrary situation which, driven by the relative <b>high</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>price,</b> and the noticeable difference between gasoline and diesel prices, there has been a continuous growth in the diesel market since the early eighties. During this time BMW has accumulated more then 20 years experience in developing and producing powerful diesel engines for sports and luxury cars. BMW started the production of its 1 st generation diesel engine in 1983 with a 2, 4 l, turbocharged IDI engine in the 5 series model range. With a specific power of 35 kW/l, this was the most powerful diesel engine on the market at this time. In 1991 BMW introduced the 2 nd generation diesel engine, beginning with a 2, 5 l inline six, followed in 1994 by a 1, 7 l inline four. All engines of this 2 nd BMW diesel engine family were turbocharged and utilized an indirect injection combustion system. With the availability of high-pressure injection systems such as the common rail system, BMW developed its 3 rd diesel engine family which consists of four different engines. The first was the 4 -cylinder for the 3 series car in the spring of 1998, followed by the 6 -cylinder in the fall of 1998 and then in mid 1999 by the worlds first V 8 passenger car diesel with direct injection. Beginning in the fall of 2001 with the 4 -cylinder, BMW reworked this DI engine family fundamentally. Key elements are an improved core engine design, the use of the common rail system of the 2 nd generation and a new engine control unit with even better performance. Step by step, these technological improvements were introduce d to production for all members of this engine family and in all the different vehicle applications. In the next slide you can see the production volume of diesel engines by BMW. From the 1 st family we produced {approx} 260, 000 units over eight years and from the 2 nd family {approx} 630, 000 units were produced also during an eight year period. How successful the actual engine family with direct injection is {{can be seen in the}} increase of the production volume to 330, 000 units for the year 2002 alone. The reason for this is that, in addition to the very low fuel consumption, this new engines provide excellent driving characteristics and a significant improvement in the level of noise and vibration. Page 2 of 5 In 2002, 26 % of all BMW cars worldwide, and nearly 40 % in Europe, were produced with a diesel engine under the hood. In the X 5 we can see the biggest diesel success rate. Of all the X 5 vehicles produced, 35 % Worldwide and 68 % in Europe are powered by a diesel engine...|$|E
40|$|Fuel for motor {{vehicles}} is currently more expensive in Austria than in most neighboring countries. Apart from taxation (mineral oil tax and VAT), the price net of tax is also comparatively high. As from May 1, 1995, when the mineral oil tax on petrol and diesel will be raised, petrol will be more expensive in Germany only and diesel in Switzerland only, assuming the tax increase will fully translate into prices and the other countries will keep their fuel prices at current levels. Thus, the tax increase also implies {{that for the first}} time it will be cheaper to fill up in Italy and that present price advantages for diesel vis-à-vis Germany, Italy and Hungary will be lost. As a result, more drivers will stop for fuel beyond the Austrian borders. <b>High</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> differentials between neighboring countries are readily exploited not only within the "normal" road traffic of passengers and goods, but also by inducing extra "filling-up travel" movements. Such arbitrage transactions may rise to an important part of total fuel sales in a small country like Austria, where tourism and transit traffic play a major role. In 1973, when petrol prices in Austria were 16 percent below those in Germany, 16 percent of overall petrol sales went to foreigners (net of petrol bought by Austrians abroad). In 1988, when petrol was 28 percent more expensive than in Germany, this share amounted to less than 3 percent. According to demand elasticities estimated for the period from 1972 to 1988, the raise in the price of petrol of over 10 percent as from next May should lower petrol sales in Austria by 4 percent. To one quarter this decline is due to an effective fall in fuel consumption, and to the remaining three quarters to the "diversion" of sales (to Austrians and foreign tourists traveling to Austria) to border regions abroad. Therefore, the raise in the mineral oil tax rate by 25 percent may boost tax revenues by only 17 percent. The mineral oil tax is a specific consumption tax on inputs and final use potentially providing incentives for ecologically responsible behavior. A high tax rate discriminates in favor of public and against individual passenger transport, in favor of railway and against road traffic of goods, and in favor of electric and against combustion type engines; it encourages sustained efforts to lower specific fuel consumption of motor cars. Over the last fifteen years there has been little incentive to reduce fuel consumption: since the second oil price shock in 1981, the price of petrol in Austria has fallen by 36 percent in real terms. In order to bring down consumption significantly, prices would have to be raised massively. However, in the event, countries with low taxes may undermine environmental efforts of their neighbors and, by way of a "beggar my neighbor" policy, may earn, on top of it, additional tax and foreign exchange revenues. In Luxembourg, for example, two-thirds of fuel sales go to foreign motorists as local fuel prices are about 25 percent below those of surrounding countries. For the full environmental policy effect to be obtained from fuel taxation, taxes would have to be harmonized at the international level.
