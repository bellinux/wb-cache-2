5|$|Spring Street, {{a typical}} {{commercial}} 19th century corridor, {{is the primary}} roadway within the district. Most buildings along Spring Street are Italianate and eclectic Victorian. The structure vary between two and three stories tall, with brick as the most common building material. The 100 block is the closest to the Ohio River and has seen the most demolition. It contains the Old Strauss Hotel {{at the corner of}} Riverside Drive, a three-story Italianate hostelry with a corbeled cornice and arched windows. The buildings on the 200 block are mostly Italianate style buildings, the most notable being the old Elk's Club structure (a three-story highly decorated glazed brick building) and the Bensinger's Building (a 1920s commercial building of pressed brick and crenelated parapet). There is more diverse architecture on the 300-block, with a 19th-century Masonic Temple, the LaRose Theatre (a 1920s orange glazed brick structure with terra cotta trim), Horner's Novelty (which had to be rebuilt after the worst fire in Jeffersonville's history), and Schimpff's Confectionery, a candy store that opened in 1891 that now also features a small candy museum. More Italianate structures are on the 400 block, but its most important structure is the 1907 Citizens National Bank Building, which <b>is</b> <b>stone</b> Classical Revival with large eagles for adornment. The block also holds the regional office for the local Boy Scouts of America council. Warder Park is located {{on the east side of}} the 500 block and features a Classical Revival Masonic Temple that used for most of the 20th Century.|$|E
25|$|The {{frontage}}: The Jain temple has a fine frontage of carved stone, carved so profusely in such delicate airy tracery that it {{is difficult}} to believe it <b>is</b> <b>stone.</b> We went up a flight of steps and came to a courtyard surrounded by what we call Moorish arches, with colonnades having groined roofs, every inch of which was painted elaborately with graceful arabesques, the effect being rich and soft in the extreme.|$|E
25|$|The {{north side}} is faced entirely in stone. It has two {{windows in the}} center of each story, both six-over-six double-hung sash. The south side <b>is</b> <b>stone</b> to the roofline, above which it turns to brick laid in Flemish bond. At the west corner it has a door to which a pent-roofed wooden stair leads from the ground. Next to it is a modern {{solarium}} and a window set with six-over-six double-hung sash. Another similarly treated window in the gable apex. A casement window is on the west corner at basement level.|$|E

25|$|The {{mainland}} and islands of Greece are rocky, with deeply indented coastline, and rugged mountain ranges with few substantial forests. The most freely available building material <b>is</b> <b>stone.</b> Limestone was readily available and easily worked. There is {{an abundance of}} high quality white marble both on the {{mainland and}} islands, particularly Paros and Naxos. This finely grained material was a major contributing factor to precision of detail, both architectural and sculptural, that adorned ancient Greek architecture. Deposits of high quality potter's clay were found throughout Greece and the Islands, with major deposits near Athens. It was used not only for pottery vessels, but also roof tiles and architectural decoration.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the houses}} in the {{neighborhood}} are stone foundations and wood construction. But the Triangle Historic District along Huntington Avenue <b>is</b> <b>stone</b> and brick, and one of only eight such districts in Boston given landmark status by the city. These seventy-one buildings bordered by Huntington Avenue, Tremont Street, and Worthington Street exemplify {{the development of the}} neighborhood from the 1870s through the 1910s. Construction of this area was begun in 1871. The Helvetia, a distinctive apartment hotel, was built at 706-708 Huntington Avenue in 1884-1885; a Georgian revival apartment building known as The Esther was built at 683 Huntington/142-148 Smith Street in 1912. Both buildings continue have retail on the ground floor and apartments above. Similar row houses line one side of Delle Avenue a few blocks away from the Triangle District. Taller and larger brick row houses also line Huntington Avenue, Wait Street, and South Huntington.|$|E
25|$|Central Carshalton, {{around the}} ponds and High Street, retains a village character, {{although}} the busy A232 {{runs through the}} area. There {{are a number of}} buildings and open spaces protected by the Carshalton Village Conservation Area. given the status by the London Borough of Sutton. In 1993 its boundary was extended to include parts of Mill Lane and parts of The Square and Talbot Road, containing the All Saints Church Rectory. The Conservation Area contains many of the Listed and Locally Listed Buildings which contribute to the historical significance of the area, and is widely considered to contain some of the finest historical architecture and road layout within the Borough. An example <b>is</b> <b>Stone</b> Court, an early 19th-century building with a gate house, situated on the northern edge of Grove Park. The Sun public house, is a fine example of Victorian decorative brickwork, and makes a positive contribution to the Conservation Area.|$|E

2500|$|Much of the city's more exclusive, {{high-end}} neighborhoods {{were developed}} in the hills and mesas within the city to capture the scenic views. One such neighborhood <b>is</b> <b>Stone</b> Cliff, a high-end, master-planned, gated community of multi-million-dollar homes built on a hillside overlooking downtown and the valley from the southeast. Bloomington in the southwest area is a residential community centered around a golf country club, with most homes built in the mid-late 1980s. The Sun River area, south of Bloomington, is Utah's first and only active adult master-planned retirement community, offering golfing and resort-style amenities.|$|E

2500|$|The Church of the Holy Sepulchre has {{a simple}} layout, only {{slightly}} altered from its 13th-century origins. [...] It {{consists of a}} long, low single cell containing nave and chancel, a porch {{on the south side}} (now blocked, and containing the original entrance door), a vestry (formerly a private chapel) on the north side, an entrance in the liturgical west end and a bell-turret topped with a broach spire on the roof at the liturgical east end. [...] The porch and vestry are of brick, {{but the rest of the}} building <b>is</b> <b>stone</b> with some protective render in places. [...] There is no chancel arch. [...] A round window of the 13th century sits high in the gabled west wall—a structure which has some local marble laid in courses. [...] Other windows are single-light lancets, mostly given brick surrounds in the 17th or 18th century. [...] The east window is wider, with three lights and quatrefoils—a good example of a simple 14th-century window in the Decorated Gothic style. [...] Inside, the roof is also simple: single-framed with a few exposed beams. [...] It probably dates from when the church was built.|$|E
