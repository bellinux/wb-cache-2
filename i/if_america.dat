Her participation resulted in Marsha Hunt's Philadelphia. According to Gilsenan, Hunt attributes the success of American democracy and capitalism to the crime of slavery, a crime that must be understood <b>if</b> <b>America</b> is to have peace. Hunt fell in love with Gilsenan and moved to the Wicklow mountains near Dublin with him, where in 1999 she helped him fight colon cancer, drawing on her own experiences with the disease. Hunt is no longer romantically involved with Gilsenan, who has since married and fathered a child, but as of 2008 still sees him.|$|E

How else is the world to take America seriously, when democracy at home is daily being outraged, free speech suppressed, peaceable assemblies broken up by overbearing and brutal gangsters in uniform; when free press is curtailed and every independent opinion gagged? Verily, poor as we are in democracy, how can we give of it to the world? ...|$|E

[...] Several times in the 1860s and 1870s, the United States Mint struck pattern coins that were to be used <b>if</b> <b>America</b> joined, in some cases with the equivalent in foreign money struck {{as part of the}} design. The twenty-cent piece was to be equivalent to one French franc in that system, and if in proportion to the smaller silver coins being struck, would weigh five grams, a fact which appealed to advocates of the metric system in Congress. Another purpose for a large issue of silver coins, regardless of denomination, was to retire the fractional currency—low-value paper money or [...] "shinplasters". [...] Congress passed legislation in 1875 and 1876 for large quantities of silver coins for this purpose.|$|E

[...] He later recalled how he turned against the war: [...] "I found out that we couldn’t win the war with the limitations that we had, which I thought were correct limitations, and I thought all {{we were going to}} do was just waste the lives of our men and our treasure out in the jungles of North and South Vietnam." ...|$|E

He lived and died with the audience in his shows, and he gave them something to remember when they left the theater, because he meant every single word of every song as he performed it. Europeans like that. In this jingoistic age of American pride, perhaps we can revisit our own true love of rock and roll by discovering Willy DeVille for the first timeor, at the very least, remember him for what he really was: an American original. The mythos and pathos in his songs, his voice, and his performances were born in these streets and cities and then given to the world who appreciated him much more than we did." ...|$|E

[...] The Minister noted that the Spanish had recently turned over American sailors [...] "belonging to the crew of the American vessel 'William Engs'", whom it had tried by request of their captain and the American consul. The sailors had been found guilty of mutiny and sentenced to [...] "four years' confinement in a fortress." [...] Other American sailors had protested this and when the American ambassador raised the issue with the Spaniards, on March 20, 1839 [...] "her Majesty, having taken into consideration all the circumstances, decided that the said seamen should be placed at the disposition of the American consul, seeing that the offence was committed in one of the vessels and under the flag of his nation, and not on shore." [...] The Spaniards asked how, <b>if</b> <b>America</b> had demanded that these sailors in an American ship be turned over to them despite being in a Spanish port, they could now try the Spanish mutineers.|$|E
