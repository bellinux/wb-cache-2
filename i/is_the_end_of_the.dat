5|$|The Chicago Transit Authority {{displaced}} the Carlton Midway Inn {{to open a}} new CTA terminal at {{the airport}} on October 31, 1993, for the new Chicago 'L' Orange Line that connected Midway to Chicago's Loop. Midway Airport <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line, which crosses the southwest part of the city before ending at the Loop. The Orange Line does not run 24 hours a day (unlike the Blue Line, which has 24-hour service to O'Hare), but does operate from about 4:00am to 1:00am, at an average of 8-minute intervals. The trip from Midway to the Loop takes 25 minutes.|$|E

50|$|Termination, as used by Quaternary geologists, oceanographers, and paleoclimatologists <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{period of}} time during an glacial cycle {{when there is a}} {{relatively}} rapid transition from full glacial climates to full interglacial climates. For the Quaternary period, terminations are numbered using Roman numerals from the most recent termination as “I” and with increasing value, e.g. “II”, “III”, and so forth, into the past.

25|$|At Junction 8 a spur off the M40 with two-lane carriageways {{leaves the}} {{mainline}} of the motorway and continues {{for a few}} miles before ending (motorway restrictions ending) at a trumpet junction for Wheatley and the A418(A40) (the old junction 8), with the road continuing as a two lane dual carriageway as the A40 towards Oxford and farther on to Cheltenham and Wales. The spur can be accessed only via the M40 northbound, and traffic heading towards the M40 can join only the southbound carriageway. Traffic going {{in the other direction}} has to use the trumpet junction, and follow the A418 past Wheatley services.

25|$|Among Sephardi Jews, prayers {{known as}} Selichot (forgiveness) are recited before the regular morning service (these {{are the same}} prayers recited before Rosh Hashanah). In the {{different}} prayers of this day, Syrian Jews pray in the same maqam (melody) as on the high holidays. In Amsterdam {{and in a few}} places in England, America, and elsewhere, the shofar is also sounded in connection with the processions. The latter practice reflects the idea that Hoshana Rabbah <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Holy Day season, when the world is judged for the coming year. Because Hoshanah Rabbah is also linked to the high holidays as well as being a joy filled day some Hasidic communities such as Satmar have the custom of having Birchat Cohanim/Priestly Blessing recited during the Mussaf service. Some communities such as Bobov will only do this if it is on Friday. However this practice is not generally done.|$|E
25|$|Many Egyptian {{stories about}} the gods are {{characterized}} as having taken place in a primeval time when the gods were manifest on the earth and ruled over it. After this time, the Egyptians believed, authority on earth passed to human pharaohs. This primeval era seems to predate {{the start of the}} sun's journey and the recurring patterns of the present world. At the other end of time <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cycles and the dissolution of the world. Because these distant periods lend themselves to linear narrative better than the cycles of the present, John Baines sees them as the only periods in which true myths take place. Yet, to some extent, the cyclical aspect of time was present in the mythic past as well. Egyptians saw even stories that were set in that time as being perpetually true. The myths were made real every time the events to which they were related occurred. These events were celebrated with rituals, which often evoked myths. Ritual allowed time to periodically return to the mythic past and renew life in the universe.|$|E
25|$|The {{recorded}} {{chronology of}} rulers over Uruk includes both mythological and historic figures in five dynasties. As {{in the rest}} of Sumer, power moved progressively from the temple to the palace. Rulers from the Early Dynastic period exercised control over Uruk and at times over all Sumer. In myth, kingship was lowered from heaven to Eridu then passed successively through five cities until the deluge which ended the Uruk period. Afterwards, kingship passed to Kish {{at the beginning of the}} Early Dynastic period, which corresponds to the beginning of the Early Bronze Age in Sumer. In the Early Dynastic I period (2900–2800BC), Uruk was in theory under the control of Kish. This period is sometimes called the Golden Age. During the Early Dynastic II period (2800–2600BC), Uruk was again the dominant city exercising control of Sumer. This period is the time of the First Dynasty of Uruk sometimes called the Heroic Age. However, by the Early Dynastic IIIa period (2600–2500BC) Uruk had lost sovereignty, this time to Ur. This period, corresponding to the Early Bronze Age III, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Dynasty of Uruk. In the Early Dynastic IIIb period (2500–2334BC), also called the Pre-Sargonic period (referring to Sargon of Akkad), Uruk continued to be ruled by Ur.|$|E

25|$|A second kind of {{experiment}} resembles the ordinary double-slit experiment. The schematic diagram of this experiment {{shows that a}} lens {{on the far side}} of the double slits makes the path from each slit diverge slightly from the other after they cross each other fairly near to that lens. The result is that at the two wavefunctions for each photon will be in superposition within a fairly short distance from the double slits, and if a detection screen is provided within the region wherein the wavefunctions are in superposition then interference patterns will be seen. There is no way by which any given photon could have been determined to have arrived from one or the other of the double slits. However, if the detection screen is removed the wavefunctions on each path will superimpose on regions of lower and lower amplitudes, and their combined probability values will be much less than the unreinforced probability values at the center of each path. When telescopes are aimed to intercept the center of the two paths, there will be equal probabilities of nearly 50% that a photon will show up in one of them. When a photon is detected by telescope 1, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the lower slit. When one is detected in telescope 2, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the upper slit. The explanation that supports this interpretation {{of experiment}}al results is that a photon has emerged from one of the slits, and that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matter. A photon must have started at the laser, passed through one of the slits, and arrived by a single straight-line path at the corresponding telescope.|$|E

The {{destruction}} of entire flocks meant that the shepherds were forced to undergo the process of again heafing (the local term for hefting) their new sheep to the hills. Normally, ewes teach this behaviour to their lambs, but with no more ewes left acquainted with a particular heaf the behavior had to be taught all over again to new ewes, inevitably involving much rounding up of flocks that had strayed over the often inaccessible fells. Unheafed sheep might also cause overgrazing by wandering if they replaced the original Herdwicks.

500|$|To {{the rear}} and at right stands Don José Nieto Velázquez(8)—the queen's chamberlain during the 1650s, {{and head of the}} royal {{tapestry}} works—who may have been a relative of the artist. Nieto is shown pausing, with his right knee bent and his feet on different steps. As the art critic Harriet Stone observes, it is uncertain whether he is [...] "coming or going". He is rendered in silhouette and appears to hold open a curtain on a short flight of stairs, with an unclear wall or space behind. Both this backlight and the open doorway reveal space behind: {{in the words of the}} art historian Analisa Leppanen, they lure [...] "our eyes inescapably into the depths". The royal couple's reflection pushes in the opposite direction, forward into the picture space. The vanishing point of the perspective is in the doorway, as can be shown by extending the line of the meeting of wall and ceiling on the right. Nieto is seen only by the king and queen, who share the viewer's point of view, and not by the figures in the foreground. In the footnotes of Joel Snyder's article, the author recognizes that Nieto is the queen's attendant and was required to be at hand to open and close doors for her. Snyder suggests that Nieto appears in the doorway so that the king and queen might depart. In the context of the painting, Snyder argues that the scene <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal couple's sitting for Velázquez and they are preparing to exit, explaining that is [...] "why the menina to the right of the Infanta begins to curtsy".|$|E
500|$|Aspects of [...] "The Big Bang" [...] were {{outlined}} by lead writer {{and executive producer}} Steven Moffat as he planned the arc of the series. Moffat stated he left room to improvise on the story and {{was pleased with the}} result, describing it as [...] "mad" [...] and [...] "amazing". Moffat stated that the title [...] "The Big Bang" [...] is his favourite dirty Doctor Who joke as it is a reference to the fact that Amy and Rory conceive their child on the TARDIS that night, as revealed in the next series in [...] "A Good Man Goes to War". Gillan described Rory's vigil for Amy as the [...] "ultimate romantic gesture" [...] which showed how much he loved Amy, and was where Amy realised how much she loved him. Moffat thought that standing guard for two thousand years would make up for shooting her. Moffat had always intended for Amy and Rory to get married [...] "from the off". Moffat described the conclusion as the story of how Amy has been changed by the Doctor and the Doctor's success at restoring her spirit to the girl he first met, believing that a man could drop out of the sky and [...] "fix everything". However, he did not return for her as he had promised and she grew believing that he was a liar and could not be trusted; Amy returns to her original belief when she stands up at her wedding and proclaims that the Doctor is real and that he will arrive. Though the episode <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series, Moffat left questions to be answered in the next series, including the mystery of River Song's identity and the [...] "Silence" [...] which appeared to cause the TARDIS to blow up.|$|E
