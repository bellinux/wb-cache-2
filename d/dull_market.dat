6000|$|Yes, we {{were sold}} at auction, like swine. In a big town and an active market {{we should have}} brought a good price; but this place was utterly {{stagnant}} and so we sold at a figure which makes me ashamed, every time I think of it. The King of England brought seven dollars, and his prime minister nine; whereas the king was easily worth twelve dollars and I as easily worth fifteen.

500|$|In 100 Best Australian Albums (2010) {{their third}} album, Neon Ballroom, was placed at No.25 {{according}} to its authors. Entertainment Weekly approved of the further advancement in Neon Ballroom, commenting on [...] "plush strings on these adult arrangements". There were once again significant advancements in songwriting; Johns was described as [...] "furious, motivated, and all grown up".
