When Phoenix had Candice on <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> Candice {{reversed}} the attack and pinned Phoenix with a crucifix. As a result, Michelle won the match, and retained the WWE Women's Championship.|$|E
5|$|Saxobeats was commercialized {{with three}} {{different}} covers shot by Andrei Nemirschi. For European standard releases, it featured Stan wearing a bob {{in front of a}} black-white backdrop, with one of her hands being attached to her head. In Japan, the release was accompanied by a photograph of the singer standing with headphones on <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> against a black background. All deluxe editions featured Stan leaning on a plastic mannequin, sporting a blue blouse along with various accessories on her hand.|$|E
5|$|The woman {{wears an}} elegant low-cut black dress with dark bands of fur {{at the neck}} and wrist. Her clothes are of the then-fashionable Burgundian style, which emphasises the tall and thin {{aesthetic}} of the Gothic ideal. Her dress is buckled by a bright red sash pulled in below her breasts. The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention {{to the structure of}} the clothing—the careful detailing of the pins pushed into the veil to fix its position—is typical for the artist.|$|E

5|$|Anna has {{distinguishable}} {{facial features}} of a typical Disney heroine, including big eyes, thin lips and a small nose. Her physical appearance has drawn much comparison between her and Rapunzel from Tangled, however there are considerable differences between them. Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, her face and chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are thicker than Rapunzel's. She also has more freckles than Rapunzel and even has them on <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Anna's eyebrows wrinkle when they move, and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks. Anna's travel outfit generally consists of magenta, black, dark and light blue, with flowery designs {{on the bottom of}} her dress.|$|E
5|$|Bubblegum plods {{on in the}} dark, {{carrying}} an unconscious Lady around <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Suddenly, she stumbles upon the disemboweled body of the oblivious Ice King. From the dark, Ricardio, the living heart of the Ice King, introduces himself, tossing an unconscious Finn and Jake into the light. Ricardio reveals that he built himself both a body {{as well as the}} dungeon complex in an attempt to impress Bubblegum. He reveals that he wishes to marry her; Bubblegum agrees to marry Ricardio if he can beat her in hand-to-hand combat. After a short fight, Bubblegum disarms Ricardio and forces him to flee, wounded, into the darkness. Later, at the Candy Kingdom, Finn, Jake, the Ice King, and Lady recover, and Lady reveals to Jake that she is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Hilde {{appears as}} a slender woman with long, red hair. Her primary {{appearance}} encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric underneath. A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E

5|$|Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was {{intended}} by Etty {{to illustrate the}} virtues of chastity and honour. It shows the moment in which Busirane is interrupted by Britomart {{as he prepares to}} kill Amoret. Amoret is chained to a gilded Solomonic column, carved with depictions of Venus, and her clothes fall from <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> as she struggles. Britomart, clad in armour, enters Busirane's Moorish chamber, and tramples a blood-stained grimoire as she draws her sword. Busirane, naked from the waist up and with Chinese-style trousers and queue, falls to the floor, his blade still pointing at Amoret's heart. Unusually for Etty, Britomart is painted very thinly, with the canvas weave still visible through the paint. Art historian Alison Smith considers that this was likely inspired by Henry Fuseli, who painted a depiction of Britomart using the same style of painting.|$|E
5|$|The {{panel is}} the {{smallest}} extant work by van der Weyden and follows the tradition of a Madonna Lactans, with significant differences. Christ {{is dressed in a}} red garment, as opposed to the swaddling he usually wears in 15th-century Virgin and Child portrayals. This is one of two exceptions where he is fully clothed; the other is Robert Campin's Madonna in Frankfurt, where he is shown in blue clothing. Mary's unbound blond hair falls across <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> and down across her arms. Showing the influence of Campin, it is brushed behind the ears. She wears a crown as Queen of Heaven and a ring on a finger as the Bride of Christ. Reinforcing this, the blue colour of her robe alludes to her devotion and fidelity to her son. The folds of her dress are reminiscent of the lengthy, crisp, curved intertwined gowns of Gothic sculpture.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Farmer slowly walking in an {{laboratory}} {{in which many}} animals are captive to serve as experiments. Depicting a supernatural creature, the singer approaches every cage {{to look at all}} the animals — pigeons, cats, bobcats, rabbits, mouses, a snake, an owl, a monkey, a doe — and heals them with her magic hands. Then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage and puts it on <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> During the second refrain, she remains standing with closed eyes {{in the middle of the}} room and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of the glass cages. She thus releases the animals and, with a monkey in her arms, leads them outside into the woods. Standing in the forest, she closes her eyes again and sends many rays of light from her hands. The last scene shows the Earth being covered by that light.|$|E

5|$|The {{mutilated}} body of {{the fourth}} woman, prostitute Annie Chapman, was discovered at about 6:00am on Saturday 8 September on the ground near a doorway {{in the back yard}} of 29 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields. Chapman had left her lodgings at 2am on the day she was murdered, with the intention of getting money from a client to pay her rent. Her throat was cut from left to right. She had been disembowelled, and her intestines had been thrown out of her abdomen over each of <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. The pathologist, George Bagster Phillips, was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6–8inches (15–20cm) long. However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts. As the bodies were not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organs were actually removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could sell as surgical specimens.|$|E
5|$|The stylized {{treatment}} {{of her hair}} could represent a ceremonial wig. She wears a single broad necklace, composed of squares that are structured with horizontal and vertical lines, possibly depicting beads, four to each square. This necklace is virtually identical to the necklace of the god found at Ur, except that the latter's necklace has three lines to a square. Around both wrists she wears bracelets which appear composed of three rings. Both hands are symmetrically lifted up, palms turned towards the viewer and detailed with visible life-, head- and heart lines, holding two rod-and-ring symbols of which only {{the one in the}} left hand is well preserved. Two wings with clearly defined, stylized feathers in three registers extend down from above <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> The feathers in the top register are shown as overlapping scales (coverts), the lower two registers have long, staggered flight feathers that appear drawn with a ruler and end in a convex trailing edge. The feathers have smooth surfaces; no barbs were drawn. The wings are similar but not entirely symmetrical, differing both in the number of the flight feathers and in the details of the coloring scheme.|$|E
5|$|As many {{as eight}} males will be at a mating site, staying in close {{vicinity}} to the receptive female. The female seems to choose the male she mates with, and the males compete {{for the attention of}} the female with a significant amount of vocalization and antagonistic interactions. The female may choose to mate with several of the males, and her choice of mate {{does not seem to have}} any correlation to the physical appearance of the males. To stimulate the male to mount her, she gives a series of mewling vocalizations. The male mounts from behind, resting his body on her slightly off-center, a position requiring delicate balance; if the female were to stand, the male would have significant difficulty continuing. He places his paws on <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> or grasps her around the waist and often licks her neck. Mating may last for nearly three hours. This unusually lengthy mating is due to the physical nature of the male's erect penis, which has backwards-pointing spines along most of its length. Fossa mating includes a copulatory tie, which may be enforced by the male's spiny penis. The tie is difficult to break if the mating session is interrupted. Copulation with a single male may be repeated several times, with a total mating time of up to fourteen hours, while the male may remain with the female for up to an hour after the mating. A single female may occupy the tree for up to a week, mating with multiple males over that time. Also, other females may take her place, mating with some of the same males as well as others. This mating strategy, whereby the females monopolize a site and maximize the available number of mates, seems to be unique among carnivores. Recent research suggests that this system helps the fossa overcome factors which would normally impede mate-finding, such as low population density and lack of den use.|$|E

5|$|The Aboriginal group {{forms the}} inner centre {{piece in the}} tondo of both bowls. As the same image was used for both bowls, the {{implication}} is that the Chinese ceramic painters were copying from the same drawing and finishing them at the same place and time. The image is of a group of four Aboriginal men with club, shield and spears, one woman with a baby on <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> – standing and turned slightly away {{from the rest of the}} figures – and another woman cowed by the men. This is thought to depict a preliminary marriage ceremony. As with the Museum bowl's Sydney Cove image, no directly related, surviving, version is known that would have been used by the ceramic artists to paint the Aboriginal group. The closest match is a drawing after an apparently now-lost original sketch by Nicolas-Martin Petit, artist on the 1800–1803 French expedition to Australia led by Nicolas Baudin. Research made around 2009–2012, indicated that during Baudin's expedition, a report was prepared for Emperor Napoleon on the feasibility of capturing the British colony at Sydney Cove. As this expedition progressed around coastal Australia, Petit began to specialise in the drawing of portraits of indigenous peoples. The French expedition arrived at Port Jackson on 25April 1802. Petit's drawing was copied for publication as plate 114 in the Voyage autour du monde : entrepris par ordre du roi (Paris, 1825) , regarding a voyage around the world (1817–1820) led by Louis-Claude de Saulces de Freycinet. The engraving is entitled Port Jackson, Nlle Hollande. Ceremonie preliminaire d'un mariage, chez les sauvages (ceremony before a marriage among the natives, Port Jackson, New Holland). Port Jackson aborigines are from the Eora group of indigenous people living in the Sydney Basin.|$|E

25|$|She had visible tan {{lines from}} a halter top or bikini, {{suggesting}} {{that she may}} have come from a region with abundant October–November sunshine, as sun tanning beds were uncommon in the 1970s, and upstate New York is not generally warm or sunny enough for such tanning during that period.

25|$|A {{black and}} cream queen {{with a short}} wig and braided tail. She is aloof and {{somewhat}} mysterious. She is often assumed to be Abyssinian, given her unusual markings and exotic short-haired appearance. Her costume is smooth and form-fitting and her make up is fairly simple, without warmers or fluff on <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> In the film version, when not actually participating in a group performance she would strike poses reminiscent of ancient Egyptian paintings, and she was Mr. Mistoffelees' assistant in his magic trick to rescue Old Deuteronomy.|$|E
