40|$|Frequency {{response}} of the moving coil loud speaker in the current drive and voltage drive methods has been investigated. It is shown that, {{in the case of}} current drive, the low cut-off frequency is f 0 = (k/m) 1 / 2 π, and the high frequency response is limited only by the cut-off frequency fA of the accoustic impedance of air. On the contrary, in voltage drive, the frequency response is much complicated : It has another high frequency cut-off at ωRL=R/L, along with fA, where R and L are the voice coil resistance and inductance, respectively. When R increases, ωRL <b>increses,</b> but Q decreses, and when Bl <b>increses.</b> the efficiency <b>increses,</b> but Q decreses, in the case of voltage drive.

40|$|Use of {{continuous}} fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites (FRCMC) for turbopump hot section components offers {{a number of}} benefits. The performance benefits of <b>incresed</b> turbine inlet temperature are apparent and readily quantifiable. Perhaps less obvious are {{the potential benefits of}} <b>incresed</b> component life. At nominal turbopump operating conditions, FRCMC offer increased operating temperature margin relative to conventional materials. This results in potential for significant life enhancement. Other attributes (e. g., thermal shock resistance and high cycle fatigue endurance) of FRCMC provide even greater potential to improve life and reduce maintenance requirements. Silicon carbide (SiC 0 matrix composites with carbon fibers (C/SiC) do not degrade when exposed to hydrogen-rich steam for 10 hours at 1200 C. This FRCMC is resistant to thermal shock transients far in excess of those anticipated for advanced, high temperature turbomachinery. Orthogonal, two-dimensional (2 D 0, plain woven, C/SiC also does not degrade when subjected to tensile-tensile fatigue at room temperature for 4 x 10 (exp 5) cycles at 75 % of the ultimate strength.

40|$|Aim: To observe {{growth and}} related {{biological}} characters by culturing chondrocytes of {{hereditary multiple exostosis}} in vitro from human and to establish bases for further research on the etiology of hereditary multiple exostosis. Methods: Chondrocytes were culture primarily from exostosis and passaged. The morphology of chondrocytes was observed by microscope. Meanwhile the abilities of cell proliferation and adhesive rates were detected and were compared with control cartilage chondrocytes. Results: The living chondrocytes still were 95 % after complete digestion. After passaged, exostosis chondrocytes grew in mololayer culture had a stellate appearance with more sticklike structures in the cytoplasm and had many obvious granules. Proliferation of exostosis chondrocytes turned slowly with passaged <b>incresed,</b> and the obvious difference existed between the 2 th passaged and the primary exostosis chondrocytes(P < 0. 01, t = 3. 203) Most of the primary exostosis chondrocytes could adhere dishes within 24 hours. But with passaged <b>incresed,</b> the adhesive abilities turned down. The obvious difference existed between the 4 th passaged and the primary exostosis chondrocytes. (P < 0. 01, t = 4. 611). Conclusion: The morphology and biological characters (proliferation, adhesive ability) of exostosis chondrocytes are different from control normal cartilage chondrocytes.

40|$|AbstractFour {{types of}} {{commercial}} grade glass fiber reinforced thermoplastics (GFRP) {{were used in}} this study. Polymer matrices included polycarbonate (PC), polyoxymethylene (POM), polypropylene (PP) and polyamide 6 (PA 6). The contents of GF were 10 %, 20 % and 40 %. The GFRP were fabricated to dumbbell specimens by injection molding machine. Tensile strength of the GFRP composites {{was carried out by}} tensile testing. Theoritical caluculation of interfacial shear strenght was analyzed using a modified rule of hybrid maixture (MRoHM) strength equation according to the orientation and direction of glass fiber reinforcing. The fiber orientation was characterized from the fractured surface observation by scanning electron microscope and optical microscope. The tensile strength of GFRP composites increased with <b>incresing</b> glass fiber contents. However, the declination of tensile strength from the prediction was attributed to the reduction of glass fibers length and fiber orientation in GFRP composites. It is interesting to report that the interfacial shear strength of GFRP composites was calulated according to the MroHM and the Kelly-Tyson model, which the interfacial shear strength of the composites increased with <b>incresing</b> glass fiber contents...|$|R
