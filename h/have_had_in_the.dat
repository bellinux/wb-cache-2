500|$|In A Room of One's Own, Virginia Woolf {{created a}} character, [...] "Judith Shakespeare", {{although}} she {{is supposed to be}} Shakespeare's sister rather than his daughter. Besides the similar names and setting, there is no other direct connection between Judith, Shakespeare's daughter, and Woolf's creation, and in fact Shakespeare's sister was named Joan. In Woolf's story Shakespeare's sister is denied the education of her brother despite her obvious talent. When her father tries to marry her off, she runs away to join a theatre company but is ultimately rejected because of her gender. She becomes pregnant, is abandoned by her partner, and commits suicide. Woolf's Judith was created in an attempt to fill a historical gap. Woolf intended to make a point about the struggle that a female poet and playwright would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Elizabethan age. Woolf speculated as to why there were so few talented women from that time. [...] "What I find deplorable," [...] she observed, [...] "is that nothing is known about women before the eighteenth century." ...|$|E

500|$|Miller and Hordern's {{collaboration}} {{continued into}} 1969 with King Lear at the Nottingham Playhouse. Hordern immediately accepted {{the title role}} but later {{said that it was}} a character he never much cared to play. Writing about Miller in his autobiography, Hordern stated: [...] "It {{was one of the most}} exhilarating and funny experiences I <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> theatre." [...] Miller recruited Frank Middlemass to play the fool, but contrary to tradition, Miller made the character an intimate of Lear's as opposed to a servant, something which Shakespearean purists found difficult to accept. Miller decided to further defy convention by concentrating on the relationships between the characters rather than adding detail to scenery and costume; he was eager not to use lavish sets and lighting for the fear of detracting from the characterisations and the sentimentality of the storyline. As such, the sets were bleak and the costumes more so; it was a style that was also used when the play was televised by the BBC later that decade.|$|E
500|$|In August 2012, another roundup was completed, {{resulting}} in a further 45 horses being removed and adopted {{out to the public}} through an auction. In this gather, 38 adults and 7 foals were removed, and the public paid an average price of $225 for each horses; the maximum paid was $2,300 for a mare and foal combination. During the roundup, 63 mares were treated with contraceptives, and the post-gather herd population was estimated at 133 horses. The price paid for these horses is higher than that paid for horses from most other Mustang herds; horses removed from unnamed herds in Oregon can be adopted for a walk-up fee of $125. However, it is lower than the price paid for horses from some other popular herds; horses from the Kiger Mustang herds sometimes sell for over $7,000 each. As of 2013, the BLM estimated there to be 145 horses in the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Range (PMWHR), a number above the [...] "Appropriate Management Level", which has continued to be set at 120. The PMWHR is the only Herd Management Area (a BLM area managed for feral horses and/or burros) in Montana. There are six additional Herd Areas (BLM areas that currently have or <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past populations of wild horses, but are deemed not suitable for horses) in the state, but none currently contain horses, leaving the Pryor Mountain Mustangs the only free-roaming mustangs remaining in Montana.|$|E
