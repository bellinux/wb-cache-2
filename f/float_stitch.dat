In {{this article}} some {{expressions}} of the tensile strain arising at the most frequently cases to the so-called <b>float</b> <b>stitch,</b> in both plain or rib fabrics are worked out. On {{the basis of the}} fundamental notions of the theory of elasticity, the possible changes occurring in the knitting thread under the effect of increasing tensile force are clarified. A method is proposed for objective assessment of these changes in order to prevent the breaking of the thread in the knitting process. The observations are made, taking in account the elasticity of elongation only. In the received formula the tensile forces have sense in the value of maximal forces, received in the process of knitting...|$|E

H 577 P ITC 2017 LiuSxxi, 172 pages :color illustrationsThe {{research}} {{progress made}} {{in the field of}} materials science and the efforts put forth by many researchers have resulted in many research works that focus on wearable electronic textiles. Nowadays, wearable electronic textiles have progressed from the research lab into the industry and subsequently commercialized. The different ways of incorporating conductive fibers and electronic components into traditional textiles have been receiving much attention due to the potentially significant commercial value. However, the industry {{does not appear to have}} the means to new knowledge and knowledge transfer. For example, the industry does not have the resources to calculate and control yarn resistance on fabrics simply based on current textile knowledge, and wearable electronic products thus cannot be further developed. Nevertheless, the results of research on such products are not significant or adequate due to the complexity of the interdisciplinary efforts required for their success. Therefore, there is a need to establish a systematic method to provide the industry with a reference source to produce wearable electronics. The relationship between different stitches and the properties of conductive materials needs to be elaborated. This study conducts a series of experiments on the resistivity of conductive knitted fabric with different knitwear structures. Based on a previous study that modeled the resistance of plain jersey fabric with different numbers of wales and courses, planar geometric models are established for 1 x n float and Single Pique structures. Resistive network models are developed for different external voltages to determine the resistance values of conductive knitted fabrics with different numbers of wales and courses. Corresponding experiments are carried out to verify the proposed models. The simulated results obtained through modeling agree well with the experimental data with an acceptable range of error. Finally, a comparison of jersey (knit), float and tuck stitches is carried out with the relative wales and courses. It is concluded that both float and tuck stitches could reduce the total resistance of conductive knitted fabrics, and between them, tuck structures can provide lower resistance as well as a more aesthetically pleasing appearance. On the other hand, float structures are more economical, as conductive yarn is expensive so its cost is reduced with use of <b>float</b> <b>stitch</b> as the loop length is much shorter than that of the tuck stitches. Three thermal knitwear garments are developed in the experiments to test the thermal performance to determine the optimal design from the different knitted structures. It is concluded that the thermal properties are influenced by the different knitted structures and Single Pique has the most optimal performance in terms of the heating effect among the three types of selected structures. The newly developed resistance models in this study will provide significant benefits to the commercialization of wearable electronic textiles, as well as to the apparel industry as they can now offer apparel products that are not only aesthetically pleasing and multi-functional, but also have high added value.

40|$|Currently, {{conductive}} yarn can be knitted into fabrics to endow {{the traditional}} textile product with special attributes, such as shielding electromagnetic waves, detecting and transferring electrical signals, replacing {{fingers in the}} operation of touch-screen panels, etc. Research on the electrical properties of conductive knitted fabrics can {{contribute to the development of}} such functional textiles. A few studies have been conducted, and it has been found that the variation of the knitted structure can impact the properties of a conductive knitted fabric. Among the properties of conductive fabrics, the resistance value is an important index to decide the performance of electrical functions. Several researchers have conducted practical experiments and theoretical analyses to predict the resistance of plain weft knitted structure. However, in addition to the plain weft knitted structure, the float structure is another important basic knitted structure. Therefore, a geometric model incorporated with a simplified resistive network is proposed for the calculation of the electrical resistance of conductive knitted fabrics with <b>float</b> <b>stitches</b> and will be studied in this paper. The aim of the model is to determine the resistive effects of conductive <b>float</b> <b>stitches</b> on knitted structures with different numbers of knitted courses and wales. The geometric model can provide a detailed mathematical description of a single knitted loop in the Cartesian coordinate system. With the simplified resistive network, the resistance of conductive <b>float</b> <b>stitches</b> in knitted fabrics can be modeled and computed. The experimental results revealed that the proposed model could approximate the equivalent electrical resistance of the conductive <b>float</b> <b>stitches</b> in knitted fabrics to an acceptable degree.

40|$|Brooklyn's {{urban fabric}} is a {{redundant}} array of perimeter residential blocks, built {{out over the}} last 200 years as a layered accretion. Within each block is a core that is spatially unified yet distinct from the public front of the street. These spaces are defined by their enclosure yet this barrier is not entirely impenetrable. Each block possesses a few unique moments of slippage in which the perimeter mass opens up to reveal a slivered view into the depths, and potentials, of this internalized world. To the vast majority, including residents, these slivers and cores remain a visual phenomenon. The near-universal practice of extruding backyard parcel lines has created an architecture of division, namely the fence, closing off the yard from the block and the block from the neighborhood. This thesis proposes an alternative scenario, in which rear fences are removed and a thin line of public space is inserted into the mosaic of existing yards. The line, activated {{through a set of}} calibrated relationships with the ground and <b>floating</b> infrastructure, <b>stitches</b> together people within the open core and works against the detritus of old divisions. Through this intervention, a new grain emerges which connects Brooklyn's blocks and transforms the residual slivers into a network of spaces that open to an engaging, and unexpected, rendering of the pre-existing. by David Miranowski.
