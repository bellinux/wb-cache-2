25|$|The Hamada pistol is a {{blowback}} {{pistol and}} functionally {{a copy of}} the Browning Model 1910. The most significant design difference between the Hamada pistol and Browning Model 1910 is the replacement of the interrupter lugs used to hold the barrel of the Browning Model 1910 with a <b>dovetail</b> <b>joint.</b> The frame plate lock design and striker assembly were also modified and awarded patents in 1943. The Hamada pistol maintained high quality throughout its production, with the bluing done to a high standard. The safety, rear frame plate, and extractor were heat tempered to a reddish brown and the barrel, striker, and firing mechanism were brightly polished.|$|E

Some of {{the earliest}} known examples of the <b>dovetail</b> <b>joint</b> are in furniture entombed with mummies dating from First Dynasty of ancient Egypt, as well the tombs of Chinese emperors.

50|$|A <b>{{dovetail}}</b> <b>joint</b> {{or simply}} dovetail is a joinery technique {{most commonly used}} in woodworking joinery (carpentry) including furniture, cabinets, carcase construction, log buildings and traditional timber framing. Noted for its resistance to being pulled apart (tensile strength), the <b>dovetail</b> <b>joint</b> is commonly used to join the sides of a drawer to the front.A series of pins cut to extend {{from the end of}} one board interlock with a series of tails cut into the end of another board.
