50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>chafer</b> (Amphimallon majale {{classified}} as Rhizotrogus majalis prior to Montreuil 2000) is a beetle of the Scarabaeidae family. Formerly {{found only in}} continental Europe, this invasive species is now found at temperate latitudes in North America, where they are commonly called June bugs. The large, white grubs of A. majale feed on the roots of most cool-latitude grasses, both wild and cultivated. This has made the <b>European</b> <b>chafer</b> an enemy of North American lawns.|$|E

50|$|Invasive {{species in}} Central Park {{tend to be}} larger, more hardy and more {{aggressive}} in general than native species. On top of that, most of these invasive species do not have predators to keep their population down, which gives these species higher fitness than native species. Some common invasive animals include Eastern gray squirrel, American bull frog, <b>European</b> <b>chafer</b> beetle and European fire ants.|$|E
5000|$|The species M. pectoralis looks similar, but its pygidium is rounded. The {{cockchafer}} {{should not}} be confused with the similar <b>European</b> <b>chafer</b> (Rhizotrogus majalis), which has a completely different life cycle, nor with the June beetles (Phyllophaga spp.), which are native to North America, nor with the summer chafer (or [...] "European June bug", Amphimallon solstitiale), which emerges in June and has a two-year life cycle.

50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>chafer</b> has a 1-year life cycle. The imago, {{or adult}} beetle, stage is quite short, lasting 1-2 weeks. The adults {{come out of}} the ground in late spring and mate in large swarms, usually on low trees and shrubs. The beetles are most active on warm, clear nights when the {{temperature}} is above 19C (66F). They emerge at about 8:30 pm, mate through the night, and return to the soil by daybreak. Beetles may return to the trees to re-mate several times over the mating period. Late in the period, the adult carcasses may litter the ground beneath trees used for swarming.|$|E
40|$|Efficacy of bendiocarb, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, ethoprop, and {{isofenphos}} {{was evaluated}} against last-instar larvae of <b>European</b> <b>chafer,</b> Rhizotrogus majalis (Razoumowsky), Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman, and Oriental beetle, Anomala orientalis Waterhouse, by incorporating insecticides into soil at one-half New York State recommended rates {{in a laboratory}} bioassay. Mortality was assessed at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 wk. The experiment {{was repeated three times}} with white grubs collected at different times and from different locations in New York. White grub species differed significantly in their response to some of the insecticides; <b>European</b> <b>chafer</b> was generally least susceptible. Diazinon provided high mortality of Oriental beetle and <b>European</b> <b>chafer</b> grubs but very low mortality of Japanese beetles. Isofenphos provided generally low mortality of all three grub species, although the levels of mortality varied among species. Ethoprop provided uniform mortality of all three grub species. Results of these studies indicate the need to develop species-specific insecticide recommendations for the white grub complex...|$|E
40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>chafer</b> Rhizotrogus majalis (Razoumowsky) {{feeds on}} turfgrass roots, causing major {{damage in the}} urban areas of northeastern North America. A {{laboratory}} {{study was conducted to}} determine the susceptibility of third-instar chafer larvae to four species of entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernema glaseri, S. feltiae, S. carpocapsae, and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora). Only S. glaseri was virulent, and only at high numbers (LD 50 = 294 nematodes/larva). Prolonged contact with nematodes increased host mortality. Optimal conditions for S. glaseri with respect to soil type and soil moisture were determined. Maximum larval mortality was obtained with 7 % moisture and a 50 / 50 mixture of chernozem and sand. These results suggest that these nematodes currently have little potential for the biological control of the <b>European</b> <b>chafer</b> in turfgrass...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} soil {{temperature}} and water on fungus-induced mortality of scarab grubs {{was investigated in}} the laboratory. Soil applications of dry mycelial particles of Metarhizium anisopliae (Metsch.) Sorokin were tested against the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman, and particles of Beauveria brongniartii (Saccardo) Petch were tested against the <b>European</b> <b>chafer,</b> Rhizotrogus majalis (Razoumowsky). Japanese beetle mortality occurred fastest in soil at 27 °C and 11 % water content and slowest in soil at 21 °C and 17. 5 % water content. Japanese beetle mortality at Week 5 of the bioassay was affected by both soil temperature and water when a high dosage of fungus was used. The proportion of Japanese beetle cadavers with sporulating fungus was influenced by soil water, dose, and a soil temperature and dose interaction. In contrast, <b>European</b> <b>chafer</b> mortality was affected only by soil temperature. Mortality rates for B. brongniartii-killed European chafers {{and the proportion of}} cadavers supporting sporulating fungus were both significantly higher in soil at 21 °C than at 27 °C. Survival of M. anisopliae and B. brongniartii was affected by soil water; concentrations of both fungi were consistently higher in soil at low water content...|$|E

40|$|Movement {{patterns}} of japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman, and <b>European</b> <b>chafer,</b> Rhizotrogus (Amphimallon) majalis (Razoumowsky), grubs as influenced by gravity, host plant position, and external disturbances were studied in laboratory soil-turfgrass microcosms. Second through third instars just before pupation were monitored using radiographic techniques. Neonates were monitored using destructive sampling. Results demonstrate significantly different movement patterns between species and among age groups. The development {{stage of the}} grub had a large effect on Japanese beetle grub behavior and a measurable, but lesser effect, on European chafers. All larval stages of European chafers and all larval stages of Japanese beetle, except neonates and postoverwintering third instars, displayed a downward movement in response to disturbance. Neonate Japanese beetles showed little movement while postoverwintering. Japanese beetles moved upward when disturbed. <b>European</b> <b>chafer</b> grubs of all age classes displayed random vertical movement with some arrestment in or near sod. Preoverwintering and postoverwintering third-instar chafers showed less dramatic arrestment behavior than other instars tested. Second-instar Japanese beetles behaved similarly to European chafers; however, third instars behaved very differently. All third instars except those tested in late winter and early spring showed some innate downward movement in the soil microcosms. Japanese beetles tested in late winter displayed random movement with some arrestment in sod, whereas those tested in early spring exhibited upward movement and arrestment in so...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of turfgrass-infesting scarab grubs {{in response to}} soil physical properties may affect the stress that each species exerts on turfgrass and the efficacy of control tactics. To gain a more realistic picture {{of the events that}} occur within the soil matrix, we have developed a nondestructive X-ray technique to study soil insect movement and behavior in simulated and natural soil blocks in the laboratory Laboratory studies using this technique were done to determine the effect of some soil physical factors on scarab grub movement patterns. Species-specific differences were demonstrated in the responses of four scarab grub species (Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman; <b>European</b> <b>chafer,</b> Rhizotrogus mqalis (Razoumowsky); oriental beetle, Anomala orientalis Waterhouse; and northern masked chafer Cyclocephala borealis (Arrow)) to changing temperature and moisture conditions. Studies also were done to determine the effect of soil moisture on the movement and persistence of an insecticide (isofenphos) applied to turfgrass and its effect on <b>European</b> <b>chafer</b> grub movement and mortality This study showed that isofenphos was relatively nonmobile under our experimental conditions, and that insecticide efficacy depended on factors, such as soil moisture, that influence the position of grubs in the soil profile. We believe that {{a better understanding of the}} interactions among grub behavior, insecticide persistence, and movement, as illustrated by this research, will improve our ability to manage scarab grubs in turfgrass and will be applicable to additional soil systems...|$|E

Bird shields prevented trapping of birds. Lawn injury beneath the sheeting due to heat build-up was not serious.

40|$|A control {{decision}} rule for <b>European</b> <b>chafer,</b> Rhizotrogus (Amphimallon) majalis (Razoumowsky), larvae infesting turfgrass was developed {{using data from}} 317 residential sites. Larvae were often abundant enough to cause damage to turf in portions (patches) of properties when average density over an entire site was much less than a damage threshold of 5 - 10 grubs per 950 cm 2. To account for this, an empirical relationship between {{the size of the}} largest patch of <b>European</b> <b>chafer</b> larvae at a site and site-wide density was used {{in the development of the}} {{decision rule}}. Properties with a patch of grubs in excess of ≍ 30 m 2 were deemed to require insecticide treatment. Site characteristics (lawn age, shade, and percentage of Kentucky bluegrass) were related to site-wide density and this relationship was used to formulate a risk assessment system. This system is used to determine whether a site should be sampled or not. Properties that are not sampled are not to be treated. Other treatment decisions are based on the outcome of sampling. The relationship between site-wide density and patch size did not allow clear identification of a density that could be used as a threshold in a sampling program. Therefore, several sampling plans were constructed that classified density according to different threshold values. Operating characteristic functions were used in combination with the aforementioned relationship between density and patch size to calculate two types of errors for each sampling plan: the probability of not treating when treatment was necessary and the probability of treating when treatment was not required. Based on these error functions, a threshold of 0. 25 grubs per ll-cm diameter turf plug was advocated. Use of the proposed control decision rule should result in few treatment errors but could lead to considerable reductions in pesticide us...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of soil inoculations of Metarhizium anisopliae (Metsch.) Sorokin propagules against third-instar grubs of the Japanese beetle and <b>European</b> <b>chafer</b> {{was investigated in}} the laboratory. Inoculum consisted of conidia; standard (unlyophilized mycelial particles with size ranges of 3 ̆c 125, 125 – 250, and 250 – 500 μm; and lyophilized mycelial particles with size ranges of 125 – 250 μm and 250 – 500 μm. Grub mortality occurred significantly quicker in mycelium-inoculated compared with conidia-inoculated soil. Total mortality, however, {{did not differ significantly}} between the two types of inoculum. Pathogen titers were consistently higher in soil inoculated with 250 - to 500 -μm-size compared to 125 - to 250 -μm-size particles. Lyophilization of mycelial particles did not significantly affect soil titers or pathogenicity in two of the three bioassays conducted...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} made of certain cations present in {{hemolymph}} and alimentary tract tissues of healthy and diseased <b>European</b> <b>chafer</b> larvae and the spores of Bacillus popilliae collected from diseased hemolymph. The major ions found in the hemolymph, in order of decreasing abundance, were potassium, magnesium, sodium, and calcium. Hemolymph of diseased larvae contained relatively higher concentrations of sodium, potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc than hemolymph of healthy larvae. Concomitantly, the concentrations of ions were lower in the mid-gut and anterior intestinal tissues of diseased larvae. Only sodium decreased slightly in the diseased tissues of the rectum and rectal sac; other ions remained unchanged or increased. Little or no manganese or copper was detected in the hemolymph or tissues. The major cations of spores of B. popilliae were sodium, calcium, and magnesium. Small amounts of potassium, manganese, copper, iron, and zinc were detected in the spores.
