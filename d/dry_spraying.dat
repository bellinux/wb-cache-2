40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} electrochemical testing of membrane electrode assemblies prepared by the DLR dry-spraying coating method on JSR aromatic membranes. The JSR membranes are composed of (sulfonated) aromatic block copolymer. The aim of this work is to demonstrate operation at elevated temperature up to 95 °C at reduced humidification of the cells {{on the way to}} achieve a temperature flexible stack. High temperature cell performance and stability is beneficial for numerous applications – e. g. in aircraft or residential cogeneration - as the cooling requirements are reduced and the cells and stacks can be operated with reduced control complexity. JSR membrane has contributed to the extension of the PEFC's operating temperature range (from temperatures of below zero to nearly 100 °C (or hot-dry conditions)). Using electrodes prepared by <b>dry</b> <b>spraying</b> the high temperature behaviour can be ascertained and a performance of 1 A cm- 2 at 600 mV can be achieved at 95 °C. Variation of catalyst loading as well as gas diffusion layers demonstrates the balance between the conflicting goals of performance, cost reduction and durability. An impedance spectroscopy analysis of the cells for different membranes shows a good correlation with the expected conductivity of the various aromatic membranes as derived from ex-situ measurements and indicates a stable membrane performance. Observed degradation is mainly attributed to the electrodes thereby demonstrating the need to further optimize and develop the electrodes specifically for aromatic membranes. Further steps in this development process will be discussed. ...|$|E

The main requirements of a GDL are the provision of a gas and water transport as well a significant electrical and thermal conductivity. For the development of PEMFC diffusion media the still unknown influence of the micro porous layer (MPL) on fuel cell performance is a major obstacle. Therefore a self-supporting MPL was developed because it allows basically to measure the properties of the MPL separately from the substrate. This MPL consists of a thin nonwoven of synthetics coated on one side with a mixture of carbon and PTFE produced by the <b>dry</b> <b>spraying</b> technology. For in-situ experiments and some ex-situ measurements these layers are pressed with the non coated side on a commercial GDL without MPL (Sigracet® GDL 25 BA from SGL). To get a correlation of the global intrinsic properties of the MPL, like through-plane permeability, electrical conductivity or hydrophobicity, to fuel cell performance, Ucell(i) -curves up to limiting current densities and electrochemical impedance spectra are measured in a 5 cm² fuel cell setup.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell has a strong dependence of its water management. The membrane needs humidity to have sufficient ion conductivity. But at high humidity, especially at high current densities, flooding of the electrodes can occur and consequently the available active area begins to decrease. The primary purpose of a micro porous layer (MPL) on a gas diffusion layer (GDL) is the effective wicking of liquid water from the catalyst layer into the diffusion media as well as reducing electrical contact resistance with the adjacent layers. In synchrotron radiography studies the importance of liquid water pathways through the porous structure for the water management is proven. These pathways can be formed by natural cracks in the MPL and {{the texture of the}} carbon fibre substrate or by artificial pore paths through the GDL. With artificial paths in a carbon fibre GDL produced by laser perforation an overall performance gain has been obtained. To get additional information about the function of the MPL as an interconnection between the reaction layer and the macro porous carbon fibre substrate a self-supporting MPL was developed. This allows the manufacturing and the following treatments of the MPL independent from the GDL substrate. This MPL consists of a thin nonwoven of synthetics coated on one side with a mixture of carbon and PTFE produced by the <b>dry</b> <b>spraying</b> technology. It is possible to perforate this layer alone and press it with the non-coated side on a commercial GDL without MPL (Sigracet® GDL 25 BA from SGL).

As a consequence, the liquid water transport of non-perforated GDL/MPLs is compared to the perforation of both layers {{as well as to the}} exclusive perforation of MPL and the GDL, by means of in-situ synchrotron imaging. Further measurements, in particular Ucell(i) -curves up to limiting current densities and electrochemical impedance spectra were done in a 5 cm² fuel cell setup, to obtain a correlation of the global intrinsic properties of the MPL, like through-plane permeability, electrical conductivity or hydrophobicity, with fuel cell performance. ...|$|E

40|$|The main {{requirements}} of a gas diffusion layer (GDL) of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are the provision of a gas and water transport {{as well as a}} significant electrical and thermal conductivity. The development of membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) for a wide temperature range (- 20 °C until + 130 °C) still favours membranes that require a certain level of humidification for sufficient proton conductivity. For the improvement of PEMFC diffusion media for these conditions, the still mostly unknown influence of the micro porous layer (MPL) on fuel cell performance is a major obstacle. An important function of the cathode side MPL at high temperature operation of PEMFCs is the prevention of membrane drying. However, concurrently a flooding of porous structures in the GDL or catalyst layers at lower temperatures has to be avoided. To get an insight that could lead to an improved GDL design for a broad range of operating conditions, a self-supporting MPL was developed, because this allows the manufacturing and the following treatments of the MPL independent from the GDL substrate. This MPL consists of a thin nonwoven synthetics coated on one side with a mixture of carbon and PTFE produced with the <b>dry</b> <b>spraying</b> technology.

Results: sCT-CS-NPs were able to be incorporated into mannitol forming inhalable microparticles by the <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process. The sCT-CS-NPs/mannitol ratios and <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process affected the properties of the microparticles obtained. The conformation of the secondary structures of sCTs was affected by both mannitol content and <b>spray</b> <b>dry</b> inlet temperature. The sCT-CS-NPs were recovered after reconstitution of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders in an aqueous medium. The sCT release profile from <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders was similar to that from sCT-CS-NPs. In vitro inhalation parameters measured by the Andersen cascade impactor indicated sCT-CS-NPs <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders having promising aerodynamic properties for deposition in the deep lung. Determination of the plasmatic sCT levels following intratracheal administration to rats revealed that the inhalable sCT-CS NPs <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders provided higher protein absorption compared to native sCT powders. Conclusion: The sCT-CS-NPs with mannitol based <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders were prepared to have appropriate aerodynamic properties for pulmonary delivery. The developed system was able to deliver sCT via a pulmonary route into the systemic circulation.

40|$|Microalgae are {{exponentially}} growing {{aquatic organisms}} that perform photosynthesis very efficiently. As such, they can realize {{a much higher}} production per square meter than traditional agricultural plants. Furthermore, they are poor in structural polysaccharides and richer in proteins and lipids. Microalgae have a characteristic lipid composition, with fatty acids often differing from those in higher animal and vegetable organisms. They are also rich in carotenoids. In order to use microalgal biomass in food or feed, processing and storage is required. However, these steps can alter the chemical composition of the microalgae. Lipids can be oxidized, lipolysis can occur, carotenoids can be broken down. Therefore, short-term storage of fresh algae was compared to direct lyophilization and <b>spray</b> <b>drying.</b> Furthermore, the influence of different storage times (14 and 35 days) at different temperatures (- 20 °C, 4 °C, 20 °C) was investigated on the vacuum packed lyophilized and <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> microalgae. The same tests were performed on not vacuum packed lyophilized and <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> microalgae stored at 4 °C. Total lipid content, EPA content, FFA content, carotenoid content and oxidation were studied parameters. It could be concluded that lyophilization or <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> {{have no effect on}} total lipid content. Storage of the lyophilized and <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> microalgae neither has an effect on total lipid content. Two days of storage of the fresh microalgal paste at 4 °C gives formation of FFAs which leads to a lower total lipid content. Lyophilized microalgae are more susceptible to lipolysis than <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> microalgae, leading to more FFAs upon longer storage. <b>Spray</b> <b>drying</b> leads to loss of carotenoids, but further storage does not lower the carotenoid content further. Storing lyophilized microalgae for a longer time, lowers the carotenoid content till under the level of the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> microalgae. <b>Spray</b> <b>dried</b> microalgae are more susceptible to oxidation than lyophilized microalgae upon longer storage. No large differences and {{no significant differences were found}} between different storage conditions. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of growth}} {{promoting}} and therapeutic antibiotics in piglet feed {{has been a}} concerning subject {{over the last few}} decades because of the risk of generating antimicrobial resistance that could be transferred to humans. As a result, many products have been proposed as potential alternatives to the use of antibiotics, and among these, <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma {{is considered one of the}} most promising. However, there have been concerns about its biosafety, particularly during periods of emergence or re-emergence of swine diseases in different regions of the world, such as the recent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus outbreak in North America. The objectives of this paper are to review recent publications about the use of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma as an alternative to antibiotics in weaned pig diets, the possible mechanisms of action of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma, and the existing evidence related to the biosafety of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> animal plasma. Particular attention is given to studies in which <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma has been directly compared to antibiotics or other alternative antimicrobial products. Several studies on the possible modes of action for <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma, such as preservation of gut barrier function or modulation of the immune response, are also reviewed. Finally, the paper focuses on the review of the existing studies on the risks of disease transmission with the use of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma from porcine origin. Overall, <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma is a promising alternative to in-feed antimicrobials for piglets, particularly during the early stages of the post-weaning phase. Additionally, there is enough evidence to support that commercial <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> porcine plasma is a safe product for pigs...|$|R
