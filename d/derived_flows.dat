40|$|The {{effects of}} {{laterally}} homogeneous mantle electrical conductivity {{have been included}} in steady, frozen-flux core surface flow estimation along with refinements in method and weighting. The refined method allows simultaneous solution for both the initial radial geomagnetic field component at the core-mantle boundary and the subadjacent fluid motion; it also features Gauss' method for solving the nonlinear inverse problem associated with steady motional induction. The trade-off between spatial complexity of the <b>derived</b> <b>flows</b> and misfit to the weighted Definitive Geomagnetic Reference Field models is studied for various mantle conductivity profiles. For simple flow and a fixed initial geomagnetic condition a fairly high deep-mantle conductivity performs better than either insulating or weakly conducting profiles; however, a thin, very high conductivity layer {{at the base of the}} mantle performs almost as well. Simultaneous solution for both initial geomagnetic field and fluid flow reduces the misfit per degree of freedom even more than does changing the mantle conductivity profile. Moreover, when both core field and flow are estimated, the performance of the solutions and the <b>derived</b> <b>flows</b> become insensitive to the conductivity profile...|$|E
40|$|In {{order for}} precise {{evaluation}} of MANET applications, more realistic mobility models {{are needed in}} wireless network simulations. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} behavior of pedestrians in urban areas and propose a new method to generate a mobility scenario called Urban Pedestrian Flows (UPF). In the proposed method, we classify pedestrians in a simulation field into multiple groups by their similar behavior patterns (simply called flows hereafter, which indicate how they move around geographic points). Given the observed road density in the target field, we derive using linear programming techniques how many pedestrians per minute follow each flow. Using the <b>derived</b> <b>flows,</b> we generate a UPF scenario which can be used in network simulators. In particular, we have enhanced a network simulator called MobiREAL, which has been developed in our research group, so that we can generate and use the UPF scenario. MobiREAL simulator has three main facilities: the behavior simulator, network simulator and animator. The behavior simulator can generate/delete mobile nodes according to the UPF scenario. The network simulator can simulate MANET protocols and applications. The animator offers elegant visualization of simulation traces as well as graphical user interfaces for facilitating derivation of UPF scenarios. Through several case studies, we show similarity of the <b>derived</b> <b>flows</b> to the observed ones, as well as the metrics that characterize the mobility of the scenario...|$|E

The <b>derived</b> <b>flow</b> series and the time series of historic flow measured at the Kafue Hook Bridge (KHB) are separately modelled using artificial neural networks (ANNs). For each of these two flow series, relevant input variables are determined with the help of input-output intercorrelations, where inputs are given to a host of three-layer feedforward back-propagation (FF-BP) ANNs to predict the current, <b>derived</b> <b>flow</b> or KHB flow. A couple of ANN models {{selected on the basis of}} defined criteria are then used to forecast the flows at m time steps ahead. To evaluate the forecasting performance of the best ANN models, comparison with best autoregressive moving average models with exogenous inputs, ARMAX, is made. In both cases the ANNs give more robust forecasts over long terms than the ARMAX models, thereby making ANNs a viable alternative in flow forecasting. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Select {{models of}} the main {{geomagnetic}} field and its secular variation are extrapolated {{to the base of}} an insulating mantle and used to estimate the adjacent fluid motion of a perfectly conducting outer core. The assumption of steady motion provides formally unique solutions and is tested along with that of no upwelling. The hypothesis of no upwelling is found to be substantially worse than that of steady motion. Although the actual motion is not thought to be steady, the large-scale secular variation {{at the top of the}} core can be adequately described by a large-scale, combined toroidal-poloidal circulation which is steady for intervals of at least a decade or two. The <b>derived</b> <b>flows</b> include a bulk westward drift but are complicated by superimposed jets, gyres, and surface divergence indicative of vigorous vertical motion at depth. The circulation pattern and key global properties including rms speed, upwelling, and westward drift are found to be fairly insensitive to variations in modeling parameters...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} curve evolution {{based on}} comparing distributions of features, and its applications for scene segmentation. In the first part, we promote using cross-bin metrics {{such as the}} Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD), instead of standard bin-wise metrics as the Bhattacharyya or Kullback-Leibler metrics. To derive flow equations for minimizing functionals involving the EMD, we employ a tractable expression for calculating EMD between one-dimensional distributions. We then apply the <b>derived</b> <b>flows</b> to various examples of single image segmentation, and to scene analysis using video data. In the latter, we consider the problem of segmenting a scene to spatial regions in which different activities occur. We use a nonparametric local representation of the regions by considering multiple one-dimensional histograms of normalized spatiotemporal derivatives. We then obtain semisupervised segmentation of regions using the flows derived {{in the first part}} of the paper. Our results are demonstrated on challenging surveillance scenes, and compare favorably with state-of-the-art results using parametric representations by dynamic systems or mixtures of them.

40|$|The {{development}} of hydrology {{and the need}} of getting exact data increase the demands on hydro metering. Measurement of spot velocities and deriving {{the flow of water}} are frequently performed by the workers of Český hydrometeorologický ústav (Czech Hydrometeorological Institute) and other companies. The limited precision of the measuring machines, the imperfection of methods and the influence of human senses cause that we are not able to get the accurate value of quantity. We are just close to the right values. The term uncertainty of measuring determines the interval which is assigned to each measurement and contains the real value of measured quantity. Twenty imminently repeated measurement were done in twelve measuring profiles of the Dyje River and in one profile of the Morava River using the current meters OTT (OTT Hydromet, 2013) type C 2 and type C 31. We investigated the dependence of uncertainties type A and B in different profile parameter. The measurement was done with the suspension bar with 2 to 4 propeller current-meters. The hydrometric car on the bridge was used in deeper waters. The results were analysed {{from the point of view}} of the uncertainties and generalized. Next point of the research was to find out how the frequency of the current meter depends on temperature of water. For this purpose, the specific canal was made in the Faculty of Civil Engineering in Brno (Ústav vodního hospodářství krajiny) and the measuring was done in temperature interval from 1 °C to 24 °C. Repeated measuring was statistically evaluated from the uncertainties point of view. In the thesis, the proposal of elaboration of uncertainties determined by both types of measurement into current methods of determination of uncertainties of the <b>derived</b> <b>flows</b> using the measurement of spot velocity by the propeller current-meter in measuring profiles of the rivers is introduced...|$|E
