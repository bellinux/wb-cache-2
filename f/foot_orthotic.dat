40|$|Non-contact {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in female athletes remain prevalent. Athletes with excessive foot pronation have been identified to be {{at greater risk for}} non-contact ACL injury. Excessive foot pronation has been linked to increased medial tibial rotation.

Individuals suffering from stroke and other neurological disorders often experience inadequate dorsiflexion during swing phase of the gait cycle due to dorsiflexor muscle weakness.

40|$|Biomechanical factors during {{locomotion}} {{are important}} contributors to knee osteoarthritis (OA). A {{better understanding of}} their potential role in intervention strategies is required. The overall purpose of this thesis {{was to examine the}} interaction between lower limb alignment and body mass on dynamic knee joint loading, and {{to examine the effects of}} knee and foot orthoses, in patients with knee OA. The thesis included three studies. Chapter 2 was a cross-sectional study using three-dimensional gait analysis and full limb radiographs in 487 patients. Using sequential (hierarchical) linear regression, results indicated a statistical interaction between lower limb alignment and body mass on the external knee adduction moment, a proxy for the load distribution across the knee and a strong risk factor for OA progression. The relationship between alignment and the knee adduction moment depended on mass, with a higher association observed in patients with higher mass. Chapter 3 was a systematic review with meta-analysis of the biomechanical and clinical effects of valgus knee braces. Data were extracted from 38 articles. When pooling data, standardized mean differences suggested that braces provided a statistically significant decrease in the knee adduction moment during walking, and in patient-reported measures of pain and function, with overall moderate effect sizes. Substantial issues related to appropriate dosage, patient comfort and compliance were also identified. Chapter 4 was a proof of concept study that tested the combined effects of knee and foot orthoses. Sixteen patients with varus alignment and medial compartment knee OA underwent repeated three-dimensional gait analyses with and without wearing a custom-fit valgus knee brace, custom-fit lateral wedge <b>foot</b> <b>orthotic,</b> and both. Results indicated that the combined use of the knee brace and <b>foot</b> <b>orthotic</b> provided greatest reductions in the knee adduction moment. Overall, the results of this thesis emphasize the importance of considering alignment and the distribution of loads across the knee during walking when developing intervention strategies for knee OA.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Under {{researched}} somatosensory {{contributions to}} postural stability, {{in addition to}} high incident rates of foot injury in the physically active population, lead to two investigative studies. An initial research study compared variables of two postural stability assessment devices to determine reliability of outcome measures and commonality of outcome measures to dynamic postural control. A second study assessed which measures of postural stability were effective in differentiating between injured persons using foot orthotics and non-injured persons, and also compared effects of 3 -month <b>foot</b> <b>orthotic</b> usage on measures of postural stability among three groups. In the first study, 23 healthy subjects tested on two separate occasions one-week apart, counterbalancing the testing order. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Pearson product moment correlations were calculated and analyzed. In the second study, 15 patients diagnosed with plantar fasciitis or medial arch sprain were given custom orthotics and matched with 15 non-injured subjects given custom orthotics, and 15 healthy control subjects on gender, age, height, and body mass index. All 45 subjects were assessed on five postural stability tests (12 dependent variables) on seven occasions over a four-month period. Repeated measures MANOVA was employed to evaluate group, time and interaction effects for the outcome variables (α= 0. 05). Test-retest reliability, in the first study, ranged from moderate to high (ICC[subscript 2, 1]= 0. 71 to 0. 92) for all outcome measures. Pearson correlations revealed four statistically significant relationships (p<. 05) between outcome measures (r= 0. 43 to - 0. 72). In the second study, nine variables were entered into repeated measures MANOVA demonstrating significant main and interaction effects. Post hoc univariate analyses demonstrated six variables with group main effects and three variables with time main effects. Interaction effects in post hoc analysis were non-significant. The moderate to high test-retest reliability observed for outcome measures in the first study is encouraging. Correlations between device outcome measures, while statistically significant, were low enough to suggest that each device provided unique information regarding postural stability. Results from the second study provide strong evidence that <b>foot</b> <b>orthotic</b> wear affects postural stability over time.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the immediate effects of pre-made <b>foot</b> <b>orthotics</b> on rear-foot and tibia variability and joint coupling patterns during stance phase of gait in male athletes with pes planus. Methods: Subjects of this semi-experimental research included 8 active men with pes planus. Kinematic gait data of these subjects were recorded by a motion analysis system with 8 cameras. After calculating three-dimensional angles, vector coding method was used for assessing coupling. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test the normal distribution of data and dependent samples t-test was used to compare means in each sub-phase. Results: Results showed that in the first 3 sub phases of stance, there were no significant differences between joint coupling with and without orthotics  (P> 0. 05), while in  the fourth sub-phase the mean coupling angle decreased significantly by 19 % (P= 0. 002 -P 0. 05).   Conclusion: These results suggest that <b>foot</b> <b>orthotics</b> does not have an effect on rear foot and tibia joint coupling patterns in the first 75 percent of stance phase of gait, but leads to a decrease in these patterns in the last 25 percent.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an engineering {{approach to the}} modeling and analysis of custom <b>foot</b> <b>orthotics.</b> Although orthotics are widely used and accepted as devices {{for the prevention of}} and recovery from injuries, the design process continues to be based on empirical means. There have been many clinical studies investigating the various effects that the orthotics can have on the kinematics and kinetics of human locomotion. The results from these studies are not always consistent, primarily due to subject variability and experimental nature of the design. Alternatively, {{a better understanding of the}} therapeutic effects of custom <b>foot</b> <b>orthotics,</b> as well as designing for optimal performance, can be achieved through simulation-based engineering modeling and analysis studies. Such an approach will pave the way to clarify some of the ambiguous findings found in the clinical studies-based literature. Towards this goal, this research presents a methodical process for the replication of the orthotics’ complex three-dimensional geometry and for the construction of finite element analysis models using estimated nonlinear material properties. As part of this research, laser scanning techniques are used to capture the objects’ details and geometry through generation of point cloud surface images by taking multiple scans from all angles. Material testing and Mooney-Rivlin equations were used to construct the hyperelastic nonlinear material properties. Using the mid-stance phase of gait for loading conditions, the ANSYS finite element package was utilized to run analyses on three different load classifications and the corresponding maximum stresses and deflection results were generated.

In the present study, a model of a custom-made three-layer contoured insole that simulates foot-insole interactions is developed by using finite element analysis.

Visual 3 D software (version 5) calculated maximum and range of; knee valgus angle, femoral internal rotation angle and tibial internal rotation angle, from the participant’s dominant leg (degrees). Percentage change was calculated from an average of the three squats per condition, per participant, between none to pre and none to post, and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests analysed the data for significant differences (p=< 0. 05). No {{significant differences were found between}} the conditions for all variables. However overall decreases in maximum angles were observed from none to post for all three variables, and a decrease in range of angle from none to post for knee valgus and tibial internal rotation. Large values of interquartile range were reported which may be responsible for lack of significant results. Additional trends were revealed, however further research is required to establish whether these are significant and as a result of orthotic intervention. It cannot be concluded that prefabricated orthotics do improve lower limb kinematics, however the pattern of the results follow trend with associated literature in the field...|$|R
40|$|We are all {{born with}} a varying {{assortment}} of biomechanical discrepancies. Ordinarily these may be of no consequence, but to those who try to achieve excellence in a certain sport these discrepancies can spell the difference between success and failure. Some athletes may {{have to accept the}} fact that biomechanically the odds are against them ever becoming excellent and that intensive training may in fact be detrimental to their wellbeing. However, the majority can be helped with advice on proper shoe wear and orthotic correction. This article highlights the role of <b>foot</b> <b>orthotics</b> as indicated for various biomechanically-related problems commonly encountered in athletes...|$|R
