500|$|Bo Diddley {{modified}} the song's signature riff for his March 1955 song [...] "I'm a Man". He reworked it as a four-note figure, which is repeated {{for the entire}} song without a progression to other chords. [...] Music critic and writer Cub Koda calls it [...] "the most recognizable blues lick in the world". [...] Waters, not to be outdone, responded two months later with an answer song to [...] "I'm a Man", titled [...] "Mannish Boy". [...] "Bo Diddley, he was tracking me down with my beat when he made 'I'm a Man'. [...] That's from 'Hoochie Coochie Man.' [...] Then <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> it with 'Mannish Boy' and just drove him out of my way", Waters recalled.

He was very sweet and put me at ease, which was great because I was petrified walking in there." [...] She noted in one ...Featuring interview that the only part that was not done live was a piano overlay that she added afterwards to complement Charles' keyboard. In the same interview, she noted that she had been given the opportunity to select a song from Charles' songbook to perform as a duet and felt that this one provided the best opportunity to harmonize rather than alternate vocal verses. On the record, the two singers vocalize, accompanied by Billy Preston on Hammond organ, who had at one time been the regular organist in Charles' band.|$|E

[...] "It was a basketball game – the school Harry attended was playing my school. I was just graduating from junior high. Well, I looked across the gym and saw Harry, and I {{fell in love}}. My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry looked up at me, and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish he had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying.

500|$|In an interview, Maisie Williams {{described}} the thought process behind Arya's scenes, {{as well as}} the process of filming saying [...] "We wanted people to think this could be the end, or the start of the end. Like maybe her wound is going to fester – like The Hound." [...] She continued, [...] "There was this constant spectrum of conversation with Mark Mylod during the chase of about how petrified she needs to look, but also how safe she is. Arya's been very lucky with the people she's encountered so far. The whole time she was with The Hound she took a back seat because he was really good. So I wanted her to look like she was struggling." [...] Williams also stated that she gave input on how the scene should take place, stating [...] "I didn't want the chase stunt to be unnecessary or superhuman. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> set {{and they were going to}} have Arya rolling around, and diving, and I was like, [...] "That looks amazing, but no." [...] I'd be like, [...] "Why would she run over there? She'd just duck under here and just get out." [...] It doesn’t look quite as cinematic, maybe, but they'll have to find something else if they want cinematic. And I felt awful because the job of the stunt guys is to make everything look as crazy and cool as possible. But I know Arya now. In the beginning it was a lot of guesswork and now I've figured her out." ...|$|E
500|$|John Hotchkis was {{originally}} hired to compose the music but, {{when he fell}} ill, Anthony Hinds asked conductor John Hollingsworth to recommend a replacement. Hollingsworth suggested James Bernard, {{with whom he had}} worked on a number of BBC radio productions. Bernard sent Hinds a tape of the score of one of these productions, an adaptation of The Duchess of Malfi, and was duly hired. Bernard watched the film a number of times, stopping after each reel to make notes and discuss where the music would be needed. Val Guest was not involved in any of the music sessions; Anthony Hinds supervised Bernard and made the final decisions as to where the music should occur. Bernard composed the music at his piano and then worked out the orchestration, which was performed by the Royal Opera House Orchestra. Hollingsworth restricted the arrangement of the score to just the string and percussion sections: Bernard recalled, [...] "I had not written for film before and had only used strings for the BBC scores, so I think that John thought {{it would be better to}} see how <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> with these two sections before letting me loose with a full orchestra". The score runs to 20 minutes and uses a rising and falling three-note semitone throughout. Bernard's biographer, David Huckvale, argues that Bernard's use of atonal strings to create a sense of menace predates Bernard Herrmann's score for Psycho (1960), which is usually cited as the first film to employ the technique. [...] Remarking on the effectiveness of the score, the film critic John Brosnan said, [...] "Of prime importance, is the contribution of the soundtrack, in this case supplied by James Bernard who never wrote a more unnerving, jangly score". Bernard went on to become Hammer's most prolific composer, scoring 23 Hammer films between 1955 and 1974. Several cues from The Quatermass Xperiment were released on CD in 1999 by GDI Records on a compilation titled The Quatermass Film Music Collection.|$|E

2500|$|An early 1996 Q {{magazine}} interview {{revealed that}} relations between Blur members had become very strained; journalist Adrian Deevoy {{wrote that he}} found them [...] "on {{the verge of a}} nervous breakup". Coxon, in particular, began to resent his bandmates and, in a rejection of the group's Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement. Albarn grew to appreciate Coxon's tastes in lo-fi and underground music, and recognised the need to significantly change Blur's musical direction once again. [...] "I can sit at my piano and write brilliant observational pop songs all day long but you've got to move on", he said, and decided to let Coxon have more creative control over their new album. Albarn visited Iceland during this period, stating that, [...] "I used to have a recurring dream, as a child, of a black sand beach.
