5|$|Although popular legends {{claim that}} Sable Island horses swam ashore from the island's many shipwrecks, or were {{introduced}} by 16th-century Portuguese explorers, {{this is not}} supported by historical or genetic evidence. In reality, the <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> deliberately introduced to the island during the 18th century. The first recorded <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> brought by a Boston clergyman, the Reverend Andrew Le Mercier, in 1737 but most were stolen by passing mariners. The present-day horses are thought by most historians and scientists to have descended mostly from horses seized by the British from the Acadians during the Expulsion of the Acadians. The Acadian <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> descendents of several shipments of French horses, including members of the Breton, Andalusian and Norman breeds, later crossed with horses from New England, including Spanish Barbs. The Boston merchant and shipowner Thomas Hancock purchased some Acadian horses and transported them to Sable Island in 1760, where they grazed the island as pasture. Although {{often referred to as}} ponies due to their small size, they have a horse phenotype and an ancestry composed solely of horses.|$|E
5|$|As {{the militia}} fell back, {{the three men}} who had set out in search of their horses {{returned}} and they too {{were killed by the}} Native American forces. The natives continued to assault the barn and cabin; their attacks did not cease and during the battle about 25 <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> killed. Finally, the native forces withdrew, leaving nine of their own dead behind. The June 25 battle was the last of the Black Hawk War on Illinois soil. Dement's company lost five men with another three were wounded, many <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> killed as well.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> nearly blown, but d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers {{charged the}} third line, which they also broke. The Russian cossacks, {{assembled}} in the reserve, entered the melee, but their light <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> {{no match for the}} French mounts, big horses confiscated from the Prussians the previous year. The Russian infantry had started to reform their squares behind d'Hautpoul's men. During this charge, d'Hautpoul was struck by artillery grapeshot and badly wounded. Several of his men managed to carry or drag him back to French lines.|$|E

5|$|Communication {{between human}} and <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> {{paramount}} in any equestrian activity; to aid this process <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> usually ridden with a saddle {{on their backs}} to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control. Sometimes <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> ridden without a saddle, and occasionally, <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear.

5|$|Discovery of the Kiger Mustang was {{the result}} of a BLM Mustang roundup in the Beatys Butte area in Harney County in 1977. During the roundup, it was noticed that among the horses {{collected}} from the area, there was a group with similar color and markings. DNA testing by the University of Kentucky showed close relation to the Spanish horses brought to the Americas in the 17th century. These distinct <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> separated from the other horses and the BLM placed two groups in separate areas of Steens Mountain to preserve the breed. Seven <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> placed in the Riddle Mountain Herd Management Area (HMA) and twenty in the Kiger HMA.|$|E

5|$|Domesticated <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> {{present in}} Bronze Age Britain from around 2000BC. Bronze Age horse trappings {{including}} snaffle bits {{have been found}} which were used in harnessing horses to vehicles; Bronze Age cart wheels have been found at Flag Fen and Blair Drummond, the latter dating from around 1255–815BC, though these may have belonged to vehicles pulled by oxen. Early Bronze Age evidence for horses being ridden is lacking, though bareback riding may have involved materials which have not survived or have not been found; but <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> ridden in battle in Britain by the late Bronze Age. Domesticated ponies were on Dartmoor by around 1500BC.|$|E

5000|$|The {{process of}} {{training}} a guide <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> rigorous and takes about eight months for each horse. [...] Initially, the <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> trained in basic lead work, {{in which the}} <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> taught to move at the speed that the handler commands and to navigate common obstacles. Next, the <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> trained in voice command recognition, and taught to respond to 23 voice commands. The <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> then taught to maneuver around both stationary and moving obstacles. After this, the <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> trained to signal to the handler {{when there is a}} step or ramp. Finally, the <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> housebroken, generally an easy process because of horses’ natural aversion to depositing fecal waste indoors. Intelligent disobedience is a crucial part of the training of the guide horse, as the <b>horse</b> must <b>be</b> able to disregard any commands that would be unsafe to the horse and the handler.|$|R

5|$|<b>Horses</b> <b>were</b> {{a central}} asset to Finnish {{military}} forces during the Winter War (1939–40) and Continuation War (1941–1944), when {{tens of thousands}} of <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> the main locomotive power of the army due to the shortage of automobiles. Animals were procured from private owners in a systematic procedure, but to ensure the continuity of Finnhorse breeding, neither stallions nor any nursing, pregnant or studbook-approved mares were enrolled to be eligible for military procurement. All procured horses officially remained their private owners' property, were marked for identification and as necessary, were returned or reported dead. The program was successful in preserving the breed, as the horse population rebounded to its pre-war count of over 380000 animals as soon as 1945.|$|E
5|$|<b>Horses</b> <b>were</b> {{probably}} ridden in prehistory {{before they}} were driven. However, evidence is scant, mostly simple images of human figures on horse-like animals drawn on rock or clay.

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Percherons {{also began to}} be {{exported}} from the United States to Great Britain, where {{they were used to}} pull horse-drawn buses in large cities. The first Percherons imported to Britain included some of the thousands of crossbreds from the United States. In Britain, many of the horses, once they finished their bus-pulling career, were sold to farmers. Other imported <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> sold to the British Army, and in 1900, 325 <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> shipped to South Africa for use in the Boer War.|$|E

5|$|The Jersey Act was {{introduced}} to prevent the registration of most American-bred Thoroughbred horses in the British General Stud Book. It had {{its roots in the}} desire of the British to halt the influx of American-bred racehorses of possibly impure bloodlines during the early 20th century. Many American-bred <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> exported to Europe to race and retire to a breeding career after a number of US states banned gambling, which depressed Thoroughbred racing as well as breeding in the United States. The loss of breeding records during the American Civil War and the late beginning of the registration of American Thoroughbreds led many in the British racing establishment to doubt that the American-bred <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> purebred.|$|E
5|$|The Lipizzans endured several wartime relocations {{throughout}} their history, {{each of which}} saved the breed from extinction. The first was in March 1797 during the War of the First Coalition, when the <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> evacuated from Lipica. During the journey, 16 mares gave birth to foals. In November 1797, the horses returned to Lipica, but the stables were in ruins. They were rebuilt, but in 1805, the <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> evacuated again when Napoleon invaded Austria. They remained away from the stud for two years, returning April 1, 1807. But then, following the Treaty of Schönbrunn in 1809, the <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> evacuated three more times during the unsettled period that followed, resulting {{in the loss of}} many horses and the destruction of the written studbooks that documented bloodlines of horses prior to 1700. The horses finally returned to Lipica for good in 1815, where they remained {{for the rest of the}} 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The Sable Island horse, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Sable Island pony, is a type of small feral horse found on Sable Island, an island off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. It is a small type, often pony sized, but with a horse phenotype and horse ancestors, and usually dark in color. The first <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> released on the island in the late eighteenth century, and soon became feral. Additional <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> later transported to improve the herd's breeding stock. They were rounded up for private use and sale for slaughter, which by the 1950s had placed them in danger of extinction.|$|E

5|$|Until the mid-20th century, the Charolais {{and other}} demi-sang breeds, {{such as the}} Angevin, the Charentais, the Cheval Limousin and the Vendéen, were {{generally}} known {{by the name of}} the region in which they existed, and did not have individual breed studbooks. As these <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> not separated by breed type, but instead by geography, there were no significant physical characteristics that distinguished the Charolais from other demi-sang types that developed prior to the mid-19th century. Charolais <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> primarily raised in what is now the Saône-et-Loire department. The areas of Cluny, Charolles, Blanzy, Paray-le-Monial and Digoin were preferred for breeding, due to the clay-limestone soils that favored the development of the equine skeletal structure.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in their history, not clearly documented, horses bred in the western regions {{crossbred}} with horses that originated south of the Gulf of Finland. This made the western Finnish horse type larger and better suited to farming and forestry work. The characteristics of the original western Finnish type prevailed, however, even though influenced by outside blood and traces of outside influence could be detected for a long time. Later, this mixed type was further crossbred with larger horses from Central Europe during the Middle Ages. Foreign <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> also brought to Finland during military campaigns, and additional animals were imported to manor houses for driving. The crossbreed offspring of Central European and Finnish <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> larger than their Finnish parents, and even more suited for agricultural work.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, Trait du Nord <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> {{among those}} confiscated by Germans from Belgium and France {{for use in}} the war. In 1919, these <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> {{returned}} to their homeland, allowing the reconstruction of the breed. During World War II, the armed forces used all stocks of fuel, and the draft horse was used to continue agricultural production in France. After the war, farmers quickly equipped themselves with mechanized equipment. The decline in the breeding of the Trait du Nord became noticeable in the early 1950s, and by 1960 breed numbers had collapsed completely. By the early 1970s, breeding had slowed so much that the Trait du Nord, along with other French draft breeds, was in danger of extinction.|$|E
