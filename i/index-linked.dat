25|$|Inflation-indexed bonds (linkers) (US) or <b>Index-linked</b> bond (UK), {{in which}} the {{principal}} amount and the interest payments are indexed to inflation. The interest rate is normally lower than for fixed rate bonds with a comparable maturity (this position briefly reversed itself for short-term UK bonds in December 2008). However, as the principal amount grows, the payments increase with inflation. The United Kingdom was the first sovereign issuer to issue inflation linked gilts in the 1980s. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and I-bonds are examples of inflation linked bonds issued by the U.S. government.|$|E
25|$|Although the 1970s in Italy {{was marked}} by violence, {{it was also a}} time of great social and {{economic}} progress. Following the civil disturbances of the 1960s, Christian Democracy and its allies in government (including the PSI) introduced a wide range of political, social, and economic reforms. Regional governments were introduced in the spring of 1970, with elected councils provided with the authority to legislate in areas like public works, town planning, social welfare, and health. Spending on the relatively poor South was significantly increased, while new laws relating to <b>index-linked</b> pay, public housing, and pension provision were also passed. In 1975, a law was passed entitling redundant workers to receive at least 80% of their previous salary for up to a year from a state insurance fund. Living standards also continued to rise, with wages going up by an average of about 25% a year from the early 1970s onwards, and between 1969 and 1978, average real wages rose by 72%. Various fringe benefits were raised {{to the extent that they}} amounted to an additional 50% to 60% on wages, the highest in any country in the Western world. In addition, working hours were reduced so that by the end of the decade they were lower than any other country apart from Belgium. Some categories of workers who were laid off received generous unemployment compensation which represented only a little less than full wages, often years beyond eligibility. Initially, these benefits were primarily enjoyed by industrial workers in northern Italy where the “Hot Autumn” had its greatest impact, but these benefits soon spread to other categories of workers in other areas. In 1975, the escalator clause was strengthened in wage contracts, providing a high proportion of workers with nearly 100% indexation, with quarterly revisions, thereby increasing wages nearly as fast as prices.|$|E
25|$|Decrees {{were made}} in January 1982 {{concerning}} official recognition of persons and bodies responsible for noise monitoring, the monitoring of carbon monoxide and benzene levels in the atmosphere at workplaces, and the inspection of electrical installations. A decree issued in February 1982 laid down safety measures to be taken against electrical hazards arising during the construction, operation and maintenance of electric power distribution installations. A decree issued by the Minister of Labour in March 1982 specified the offices responsible for carrying out the technical tests on particularly dangerous machinery (listed in a decree of April 1981) which are required before the machinery can be officially approved. It also specified the {{information to be provided}} by the person applying for official approval. A decree of May 1982 contained provisions on the setting up, restructuring, organization, financing and tasks of occupational health services in agricultural undertakings and listed those agricultural undertakings for which special medical surveillance is required. Another decree, made that same month, contained new regulations governing health, safety and preventive health measures in public undertakings. It laid down detailed health and safety requirements and specified how these were to be met. It also contained provisions on training in the area, medical surveillance, and health and safety services. Two Orders of July 1982 amended the rules applicable to fixed-term contracts and temporary work with the intention of restricting the use of casual labour and improving the living and working conditions of workers in insecure jobs. A law of July 1982 concerning the spouses of craftsmen and tradesmen employed in the family business amended the provisions of the labour code, social security system, civil code and company law to establish an occupational status for this group of people. In June 1982, a new popular savings book paying <b>index-linked</b> interest was introduced, under which Individuals domiciled for tax purposes in France and whose tax liability was under FF 1 000 were entitled to hold a maximum of FF 10000 (FF 20000 for households) savings in that scheme. Also in 1982, holidays for the low-paid were encouraged by an extension of holiday Vouchers (Cheques-Vacances), subsidized by the employer and requiring regular saving out of earnings. A banking law of January 1984 entitled individuals lacking current accounts who had been refused by three banks to ask the Bank of France to designate a bank or the postal bank to provide them with free accounts.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, a {{deal was}} signed between Ecclestone and the FIA that passed {{all of the}} {{commercial}} rights to Formula One to him for 15years, {{on the condition that}} they would return to the FIA {{at the end of that}} period. Ecclestone had been building up Formula One as a television package since the early 1990s, investing heavily in new digital television technology. For the duration of the deal, the FIA would receive an <b>index-linked</b> annual fixed royalty, estimated by Lovell at around 15%. Mosley said [...] "My belief is that I got a better deal than anyone else could have because it was more difficult for Ecclestone to take a hard line with me as we had worked together for so long." [...] The following year the FIA also passed the rights to all its other directly sanctioned championships and events to Ecclestone, also for 15years, An attempt to add a 10-year extension to the F1 contract in return for a share in Ecclestone's proposed flotation of Formula One was later vetoed by the European Commission. Mosley's agreement with Ecclestone on TV rights for F1 angered three of the team principals in particular: Ron Dennis (McLaren), Frank Williams (Williams) and Ken Tyrrell (Tyrrell), who felt that neither Ecclestone nor the FIA had the right to make such an agreement without the teams. They refused to sign the 1997 Concorde Agreement without increased financial returns and threatened to make a complaint under European Union competition rules. The European Commission was already investigating the FIA’s agreement with Ecclestone in what Lovell calls a [...] "highly personal and bitter battle between Max Mosley and [...] van Miert".|$|E
50|$|These {{account for}} around {{a quarter of}} UK {{government}} debt within the gilt market. The UK {{was one of the}} first developed economies to issue <b>index-linked</b> bonds in 1981. Initially only tax-exempt pension funds were allowed to hold these bonds. The UK has issued around 20 <b>index-linked</b> bonds since then. Like conventional gilts, <b>index-linked</b> gilts pay coupons which are initially set in line with market interest rates. (Recently, real market interest yields for many (at times, all) <b>index-linked</b> gilts have been negative; but the coupons for new issues have been constrained to be at least +0.125%.) However, their semi-annual coupons and principal payment are adjusted in line with movements in the General Index of Retail Prices (RPI).|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} <b>index-linked</b> bonds, there are time lags between the {{collection}} of prices data, {{the publication of the}} inflation index and the indexation of the bond. From their introduction in 1981, <b>index-linked</b> gilts had an eight-month indexation lag (between the month of collection of prices data and the month of indexation of the bond). This was so that the amount of the next coupon was known at the start of each six-month interest accrual period. However, in 2005 the UK Debt Management Office announced that all new issues of <b>index-linked</b> gilts would use a three-month indexation lag, first used in the Canadian Real Return Bond market, and the majority of <b>index-linked</b> gilts now in issue are structured on that basis.|$|E

5000|$|In the UK, {{government}} bonds are called gilts. Older issues have {{names such as}} [...] "Treasury Stock" [...] and newer issues are called [...] "Treasury Gilt". Inflation-indexed gilts are called <b>Index-linked</b> gilts.|$|E
5000|$|The RPI {{is still}} {{used by the}} {{government}} {{as a base for}} various purposes, such as the amounts payable on <b>index-linked</b> securities including <b>index-linked</b> gilts, and social housing rent increases. Many employers also use it as a starting point in wage negotiation. Since 2003, it is no longer used by the government for the inflation target for the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee nor, from April 2011, {{as the basis for the}} indexation of the pensions of former public sector employees. , the UK state pension is indexed by the highest of the increase in average earnings, CPI or 2.5% ("the triple lock").|$|E

5000|$|In {{a letter}} dated 12 April 2010, Webb said {{on behalf of}} the Liberal Democrats: [...] "We are very clear that all accrued rights should be honoured: a pension promise made should be a pension promise kept.

[...] However in July 2010, as the Coalition Minister for Works and Pensions, Webb announced plans to link private sector pension payments to the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) instead of the Retail Prices Index (RPI), which would reduce the value of fully accrued <b>index-linked</b> pensions.|$|E
50|$|Target-date funds' asset {{allocation}} mix typically provides exposure to return-seeking assets, such as equities, in early years when risk capacity is higher, and becomes increasingly conservative as time progresses with exposure switched progressively towards capital-preservation assets, such as government- and <b>index-linked</b> bonds.|$|E

5000|$|Massive {{investment}} of short-term borrowings in high yield assets with over-estimated safety and liquidity.

5000|$|One {{possible}} approach, and {{one that}} is gaining increasing attention, is the use of replicating portfolios or hedge portfolios.

50|$|Nominal {{bracket creep}} {{can easily be}} countered by a system of <b>index-linked</b> tax brackets, but this may be {{politically}} undesirable.
