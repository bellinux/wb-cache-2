In an essay published that year he acknowledged {{that he could not}} understand those British pacifists who were reconciled to [...] "handing over great blocks of the black and coloured races to the Empire <b>to</b> <b>exploit</b> and experiment upon" [...] and that the extent of his own pacifism depended in the first instance upon an armed peace, with [...] "England <b>keeping</b> <b>to</b> England and Germany to Germany". State boundaries would be established according to natural ethnic affinities, rather than by planners in distant imperial capitals, and overseen by his envisaged world alliance of states.|$|R

40|$|Microprocessors must exploit both instruction-level {{parallelism}} (ILP) {{and memory}} parallelism for high performance. Sophisticated techniques for ILP have boosted {{the ability of}} modern-day microprocessors <b>to</b> <b>exploit</b> ILP when available. Unfortunately, improvements in memory parallelism in microprocessors have lagged behind. This thesis explains why memory parallelism is hard <b>to</b> <b>exploit</b> in microprocessors and advocate bank-exposed architectures as an effective way <b>to</b> <b>exploit</b> more memory parallelism. Bankexposed architectures {{are a kind of}} software-exposed architecture: one in which the lowlevel details of the hardware are visible to the software. In a bank-exposed architecture, the memory banks are visible to the software, enabling the compiler <b>to</b> <b>exploit</b> a high degree of memory parallelism in addition to ILP. Bank-exposed architectures can be employed by general-purpose processors, and by embedded chips, such as those used for digital-signal processing. This thesis presents Maps, an enab [...] ...|$|R
