500|$|Strong and polarised {{opinions}} about Naim amplifiers {{led to the}} NAIT being called [...] "one {{of the most controversial}} and famous integrated amps in the history of HiFi" [...] by Lucio Cadeddu. This controversy has been {{as much to do with}} the company's refusal to follow the fashion of [...] "audiophile-approved values"– such as power ratings and holographic soundstage– as its idiosyncratic preference for connectors other than RCA connectors and its eschewing of tone controls. The volume control always sits on the wrong (left) side of the <b>facia.</b> However, the trade noted that the unique sound of the NAIT caused it to become [...] "an instant classic" [...] upon release. As one of the most recognisable pieces of hi-fi, the NAIT has acquired an iconic and legendary status among integrated amplifiers; Hi-fi World said: [...] "If there was ever a quintessentially British affordable audiophile amplifier, the Naim NAIT is it." ...|$|E

The roof of the entire structure is flat including that of another east facing circular temple within the outer circular wall. A large passage or courtyard lies between the outer enclosure and the central temple which is dedicated to Lord Shiva. There is an open porch entrance to this temple. The exterior surface of the outer wall has carvings of Hindu deities. Each of the 64 chambers in the outer circle has an image of Shiva deified in it. However, recent investigations have confirmed that originally these had a Yogini image deified in them and hence the temple is known as Chausath Yogini Temple ('Chausath' here means [...] "Sixty four" [...] ). It is said that the roof over the 64 chambers and the central shrine had towers or shikharas which were probably removed during later modifications.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015 {{this paper}} was {{reviewed}} by Michael Weisberg, who reported that [...] "most of Gould's arguments against Morton are sound. Although Gould made some errors and overstated his case {{in a number of}} places, he provided prima <b>facia</b> evidence, as yet unrefuted, that Morton did indeed mismeasure his skulls in ways that conformed to 19th century racial biases". Biologists and philosophers Jonathan Kaplan, Massimo Pigliucci, and Joshua Alexander Banta also published a critique of the group's paper, arguing that many of its claims were misleading and the re-measurements were [...] "completely irrelevant to an evaluation of Gould's published analysis". They also maintain that the [...] "methods deployed by Morton and Gould were both inappropriate" [...] and that [...] "Gould's statistical analysis of Morton's data is in many ways no better than Morton's own".|$|E

For the 1980 model year, Chevrolet combined the Spyder equipment and appearance packages into one Spyder equipment package with an RPO code of Z29 and included newly re-designed bold Spyder side decals and a new front air dam that blends into the front fender wheel openings. [...] Spyder decal color choices (five) were based primarily upon the interior color specified rather than the body color as in previous years.|$|E

2500|$|The GTO was {{assembled}} by GM's Holden subsidiary at Elizabeth. It {{was equipped with}} the 5.7 liter LS1 V8 engine for the 2004 model year, the same engine found in the concurrent model year Chevrolet Corvette, {{with a choice of}} a 6-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic. Changes from the Australian-built Monaro included bracing additions to the body to meet U.S. crash standards, a [...] "corporate Pontiac" [...] front <b>facia,</b> new badging, [...] "GTO" [...] stitching on the front seats, and a revised exhaust system. GM Engineers benchmarked the sound of the 1964 GTO held in the Pontiac historical collection, as well as other LS1-powered vehicles, while working with the exhaust vendor to tune the system. The effort was made to make the new GTO invoke the same sound as the original while still meeting the noise threshold required by some states. The 2004 GTO exhaust was a true dual system that followed the original Monaro exhaust routing, thus both tailpipes exited on the driver side of the vehicle. General Motors claimed performance of 5.3 seconds to 60 and a 13.8 second quarter mile time, which was closely verified by several magazine tests.|$|E
