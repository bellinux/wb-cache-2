Compared with control samples, those treated with acidic (NH 4) 2 S solution showed great improvements in frequency <b>dispersion,</b> <b>gate</b> leakage current and interface trap density. These improvements were attributed to the acidic (NH 4) 2 S solution enhancing passivation of the substrates, which was analyzed from the perspective of chemical mechanism and confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high-resolution cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy.

The effects of ozone PDT on the interfacial and electrical properties of Al 2 O 3 and HfO 2 gate dielectric films on GaSb substrates were investigated carefully. It is {{found that the}} dielectric quality and the interfacial properties of the Al 2 O 3 and HfO 2 films are improved by ozone PDT. After in-situ ozone PDT for 5 min, the Al 2 O 3 and HfO 2 films on GaSb substrates exhibit improved electrical and interfacial properties, such as reduced frequency <b>dispersion,</b> <b>gate</b> leakage current, border traps and interface traps.

40|$|Primarily used as {{transparent}} electrodes in solar-cells, more recently, physical vapor deposited(PVD) {{transparent conductive oxide}} (TCO) materials (e. g. ZnO, In 2 O 3 and SnO 2) {{also serve}} as the active layer in thin-film transistor (TFT) technology for modern liquidcrystaldisplays. Relative to a-Si:H and organic TFTs, commercial TCO TFTs have reducedoff-state leakage and higher on-state currents. Additionally, since they are transparent, theyhave the added potential to enable fully transparent TFTs which can potentially improvethe power efficiency of existing displays. In addition to PVD, solution-processing is an alternative route {{to the production of}} displaysand other large-area electronics. The primary advantage of solution-processing is inthe ability to deposit materials at reduced-temperatures on lower-cost substrates (e. g. glass,plastics, paper, metal foils) at high speeds and over large areas. The versatility offered bysolution-processing is unlike any conventional deposition process making it a highly attractiveemergent technology. Unfortunately, the benefits of solution-processing are often overshadowed by a dramatic reductionin material quality relative to films produced by conventional PVD methods. Consequently,there is a need to develop methods that improve the electronic performance ofsolution-processed materials. Ideally, this goal can be met while maintaining relatively lowprocessing temperatures so as to ensure compatibility with low-cost roll-compatible substrates. Mobility is a commonly used metric for assessing the electronic performance of semiconductorsin terms of charge transport. It is commonly observed that TCO materials exhibit significantlyhigher field-effect mobility when used in conjunction with high-k gate dielectrics (10 to 100 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1) as opposed to conventional thermally-grown SiO 2 (0. 1 to 20 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1). Despite the large amount of empirical data documenting this bizarre effect, its physical ori- 2 gin is poorly understood. In this work, the interaction between semiconductor TCO films and high-k dielectrics isstudied with the goal of developing a theory explaining the observed mobility enhancement. Electrical investigation suggests that the mobility enhancement is due to an effective dopingof the TCO by the high-k dielectric, facilitated by donor-like defect states inadvertentlyintroduced into the dielectric during processing. The effect these states have on electrontransport in the TCO is assessed based on experimental data and electrostatic simulationsand is found to correlate with negative aspects of TFT behavior (e. g. frequency dispersion,gate leakage, hysteresis, and poor bias stability). Based on these findings, we demonstrate the use of an improved device structure, analogousto the concept of modulation doping, which uses the high-k dielectric film as an encapsulate,rather than a gate-dielectric, to achieve a similar doping effect. In doing so, the enhancedmobility of the TCO/high-k interface is retained while simultaneously eliminating the negativedrawbacks associated with the presence of charged defects in the gate dielectrics (e. g. frequency <b>dispersion,</b> <b>gate</b> leakage, hysteresis, and poor bias stability). This demonstratesimproved understanding of the role of solution-processed high-k dielectrics in field-effectdevices as well as provides a practical method to overcome the performance degradationincurred through the use of low-temperature solution-processed TCOs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An {{improved}} two-frequency {{method of}} capacitance measurement for the high-k gate dielectrics is proposed. The equivalent circuit {{model of the}} MOS capacitor including the four parameters of intrinsic capacitance, loss tangent, parasitic series inductance, and series resistance is developed. These parameters can be extracted by independently measuring the capacitor at two different frequencies. This technique is demonstrated for high-k SrTiO 3 gate dielectrics and {{the results show that}} the calibrated capacitances are invariant over a wide range of frequency. In addition, the extracted loss tangent, inductance and resistance are independent on gate voltage and frequency. The effect of series resistance on the frequency dispersion of the capacitance can be also explained by this model. These results indicate that this modified technique can be incorporated in the routine ca-pacitance–voltage (–) measurement procedure providing the physically meaningful data for the high-k gate dielectrics.
