40|$|Prognostics is {{necessary}} to ensure the reliability and safety of lithium-ion batteries for hybrid electric vehicles or satellites. This process {{can be achieved by}} capacity estimation, which is a direct <b>fading</b> <b>indicator</b> for assessing the state of health of a battery. However, the capacity of a lithium-ion battery onboard is difficult to monitor. This paper presents a data-driven approach for online capacity estimation. First, six novel features are extracted from cyclic charge/discharge cycles and used as indirect health indicators. An adaptive multi-kernel relevance machine (MKRVM) based on accelerated particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to determine the optimal parameters of MKRVM and characterize the relationship between extracted features and battery capacity. The overall estimation process comprises offline and online stages. A supervised learning step in the offline stage is established for model verification to ensure the generalizability of MKRVM for online application. Cross-validation is further conducted to validate the performance of the proposed model. Experiment and comparison results show the effectiveness, accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach for online capacity estimation of lithium-ion batteries...|$|E

40|$|Prognostics and {{remaining}} useful life (RUL) estimation for lithium-ion batteries {{play an important role}} in intelligent battery management systems (BMS). The capacity is often used as the <b>fade</b> <b>indicator</b> for estimating the remaining cycle life of a lithium-ion battery. For spacecraft requiring high reliability and long lifetime, in-orbit RUL estimation and reliability verification on ground should be carefully addressed. However, it is quite challenging to monitor and estimate the capacity of a lithium-ion battery on-line in satellite applications. In this work, a novel health indicator (HI) is extracted from the operating parameters of a lithium-ion battery to quantify battery degradation. Moreover, the Grey Correlation Analysis (GCA) is utilized to evaluate the similarities between the extracted HI and the batteryâ€™s capacity. The result illustrates the effectiveness of using this new HI for fading indication. Furthermore, we propose an optimized ensemble monotonic echo state networks (En_MONESN) algorithm, in which the monotonic constraint is introduced to improve the adaptivity of degradation trend estimation, and ensemble learning is integrated to achieve high stability and precision of RUL prediction. Experiments with actual testing data show the efficiency of our proposed method in RUL estimation and degradation modeling for the satellite lithium-ion battery application...|$|R
30|$|Oil sands are {{the most}} {{important}} of the oil and gas resources in Canada. So the distribution and evaluation of oil sands form a critical basis for risk investment in Canada. Distribution of oil sands resources is severely controlled by the reservoir heterogeneity. Deterministic modeling is commonly used to solve the heterogeneity problems in the reservoir, but rarely used to evaluate hydrocarbon resources. In this paper, a lithofacies based deterministic method is employed to assess the oil sands resources for a part of a mining project in northern Alberta. The statistical analysis of Dean Stark water and oil saturation data and study of the core description data, regional geology and geophysical logs reveal that the lithofacies in the study area can be classified into reservoir fades, possible reservoir fades and non-reservoir <b>fades.</b> The <b>indicator</b> krigging method is used to build a 3 D lithofacies model based on the classification of sedimentary fades and the ordinary krigging method is applied to petrophysical property modeling. The results show that the krigging estimation is one of the good choices in oil sand resources modeling in Alberta. Lithofacies-grade based modeling may have advantages over the grade-only based modeling.|$|R
