5|$|Failing to <b>find</b> <b>another</b> <b>job</b> {{at a news}} agency, he met {{producer}} Allan Burns at a party. Burns got him a job on My Mother the Car {{where he}} was hired to rewrite a script after pitching some story ideas. Brooks {{then went on to}} write episodes of That Girl, The Andy Griffith Show and My Three Sons before Sheldon Leonard hired him as a story editor on My Friend Tony. In 1969 he created for ABC the series Room 222, which lasted until 1974. Room 222 was the second series in American history to feature a black lead character, in this case high school teacher Pete Dixon played by Lloyd Haynes. The network felt the show was sensitive and so attempted to change the pilot story so that Dixon helped a white student rather than a black one, but Brooks prevented it. On the show Brooks worked with Gene Reynolds who taught him the importance of extensive and diligent research, which he conducted at Los Angeles High School for Room 222, and he used the technique on his subsequent works. Brooks left Room 222 as head writer after one year to work on other pilots and brought Burns in to produce the show.|$|E

2500|$|Richard Dawkins' book The Selfish Gene was Skilling's {{favorite}} book {{and served as}} the foundation of his managerial philosophy. Skilling held, by his own interpretation, a Darwinian view of what makes the world work. He believed that money and fear were the only things that motivated people. He set up the performance review system (PRC) in which employees were graded from 1 to 5, 5 being lowest. Fifteen percent of people had to be graded five, regardless of absolute performance. Those were given two weeks to try to <b>find</b> <b>another</b> <b>job</b> at Enron or be fired. The scheme {{came to be known as}} [...] "rank and yank". Skilling said [...] "The PRC process is the most important process we conduct as a company".

She always wore a little black bonnet and a white apron; her sleeves were tucked up to the elbow; she cut the sandwiches with large, dirty, greasy hands; and there was grease on her bodice, grease on her apron, grease on her skirt. She was called Mrs. Fletcher, but everyone addressed her as 'Ma'; she was really fond of the shop assistants, whom she called her boys; she never minded giving credit towards the end of the month, and it was known that now and then she had lent someone or other a few shillings when he was in straits. She was a good woman. When they were leaving or when they came back from the holidays, the boys kissed her fat red cheek; and more than one, dismissed and unable to <b>find</b> <b>another</b> <b>job,</b> had got for nothing food to keep body and soul together. The boys were sensible of her large heart and repaid her with genuine affection.

40|$|Health {{insurance}} {{helps to}} protect {{individuals and families}} against financial loss. Having health insurance also promotes access to regular health care. Most Americans with private health insurance are covered through an employer, or through the employer of a family member. A {{recent study by the}} Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that in 2012, 59. 5 % of insured Americans had their insurance through an employer. When an employee is terminated, his or her employer-sponsored health insurance usually ends within 30 to 60 days. If that health insurance is family coverage, then a worker’s family members can also become uninsured. Even if the worker <b>finds</b> <b>another</b> <b>job</b> with health benefits, a family can experience long periods of uninsurance, as they wait to qualify for the new benefit. This same problem is also faced by families that experience a reduction in hours in the workplace, the death of a worker, or a divorce. In 1985, Congress passed legislation to provide the unemployed temporary access to their former employer’s health insurance. Under Title X of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA; P. L. 99 - 272), an employer with 20 or more employees who provided health insurance benefits must provide qualified employees and their families the option of continuing their coverage under the employer’s group health insurance plan in the case of certain events. The former employee is responsible for paying the entire premium. Employers who fail to provide the continued health insurance option are subject to penalties. This report provides background on COBRA, a brief explanation of the program, its origins, issues, and how the Affordable Care Act might impact COBRA...|$|R
