5|$|Beginning {{with their}} third album, Master of Reality, Black Sabbath began to feature tuned-down guitars. In 1965, before forming Black Sabbath, guitarist Tony Iommi {{suffered}} an accident {{while working in}} a sheet metal factory, losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand. Iommi almost gave up music, but was urged by the factory manager to listen to Django Reinhardt, a jazz guitarist who lost the use of two fingers in a fire. Inspired by Reinhardt, Iommi created two thimbles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingertips. The guitarist began using lighter strings, and <b>detuning</b> his guitar, to better grip the strings with his prosthesis. Early in the band's history Iommi experimented with different dropped tunings, including C tuning, or 3 semitones down, before settling on E/D tuning, or a half-step down from standard tuning.|$|E

25|$|By {{recording}} several images {{at different}} <b>detuning</b> angles, meaning at different {{positions on the}} rocking curve, a data set is gained which allows the retrieval of quantitative differential phase information. There are several algorithms to reconstruct information from the rocking curves, some of them provide an additional signal. This signal comes from Ultra-small-angle scattering by sub-pixel sample structures and causes angular broadening of the beam and hence a broadening of {{the shape of the}} rocking curve. Based on this scattering contrast a new kind of image called Dark-field image can be produced.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background. Many of the {{properties}} of metamaterials {{are similar to those}} found in the filter on mutually <b>detuned</b> frequency and unrelated resonators. The bridge filters are used as a low-frequency prototypes of such microwave filters. It is important to establish an analogy between metamaterials and filters on mutually <b>detuned</b> frequency and unrelated resonators for further development and design of new types of metamaterials. Objective. A central objective is a model development of metamaterials based on band-exclusive microwave filters on mutually <b>detuned</b> resonators, and the low-frequency-based prototypes. Methods. Characteristic equivalence test of metamaterials to microwave filters on mutually <b>detuned</b> resonators, their specific dependencies reveal (the modes in parallel channels, the locations of the attenuation poles above or below the bandwidth), manifested regardless of the types of resonators, the study of the possibility of the bridge filter prototypes using for metamaterials simulation. Results. The analogy between metamaterials and microwave filters on mutually <b>detuned</b> resonator is specified, the possibility of bridge bandpass filter use as low-frequency prototypes is shown. Conclusions. Microwave filters on mutually <b>detuned</b> resonators, and bridge band-pass filters as low-frequency prototypes, design techniques of which are well established, can be used for metamaterial modeling. ????????????. ?????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????? ?? ??, ??? ??????? ? ???????? ?? ??????? ???????????? ?? ??????? ? ?? ????????? ????? ????? ???????????. ? ???????? ?????????????? ?????????? ???????? ????????????? ???????? ???????????? ???????? ???????. ??? ?????????? ?????????? ? ?????????????? ????? ????? ?????????????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????? ????? ??????????????? ? ????????? ?? ??????? ???????????? ?? ??????? ? ?? ????????? ????? ????? ???????????. ???? ????????????. ???????? ??????? ?????????????? ?? ?????? ??????????? ???????? ??? ?? ??????? ???????????? ???????????, ? ????? ?? ???? ?????????????? ??????????. ???????? ??????????. ???????? ??????????????? ????????????? ?????????????? ???????? ??? ?? ??????? ???????????? ???????????; ????????? ???????? ?? ???????????????

2500|$|A crucial {{component}} of Van Halen's style is {{his use of}} the Floyd Rose locking tremolo, released in 1977. [...] Early tremolo bars allowed the guitarist to impart a vibrato to a chord or single string via movement of the bar with the picking hand, but the slackening of the strings when the bar was heavily depressed could lead to <b>detuning.</b> [...] The addition of the locking bolts at the nut and bridge kept the strings taut and allowed for drastic depression of the tremolo bar to create effects such as the dive bomb.

2500|$|Edge: A {{strip of}} metal, tuned {{normally}} to just less than 90-degrees, {{that runs the}} length of {{either side of the}} board. This sharp edge is necessary to be able to produce enough friction to ride on ice, and the radius of the edge directly affects the radius of carving turns, and in turn the responsiveness of the board. Kinking, rusting, or general dulling of the edge will significantly hinder the ability for the edge to grip the snow, so it is important that this feature is maintained. However, many riders who spend a fair amount of their time grinding park rails, and especially handrails, will actually use a <b>detuning</b> stone or another method to intentionally dull their edges, either entirely or only in certain areas. [...] This helps to avoid [...] "catching" [...] on any tiny burrs or other obstructions that may exist or be formed on rails, boxes, and other types of grind. [...] Catching on a rail can, more than likely, result in a potentially serious crash, particularly should it occur on a handrail or more advanced rail set-up. [...] In addition, it's relatively common for freestyle riders to [...] "detune" [...] the edges around the board's contact points. [...] This practice can help to reduce the chances of the rider catching an edge in a choppy or rutted-out jump landing or similar situation. It {{is important to keep in}} mind that drastic edge <b>detuning</b> can be near-impossible to fully reverse and will significantly impede board control & the ability to hold an edge in harder-packed snow. [...] One area where this can be quite detrimental is in a half-pipe, where well-sharpened edges are often crucially important for cutting through the hard, sometimes icy, walls.|$|E

The main purpose is to show harmonic current amplification that generated by the parallel resonance phenomenon in power system and problem solution. The power system model for analysis consist of the harmonic current source and PFC system. These devices are established by MATHLAB/Simulink. In simulation, the variable speed drive, which is DC drive, instead to the harmonic current source in power system that use capacitor to improve power factor of system.
