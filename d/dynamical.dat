5|$|Discerning <b>dynamical</b> {{families}} {{within the}} Jupiter trojan population {{is more difficult}} {{than it is in}} the asteroid belt, because the Jupiter trojans are locked within a far narrower range of possible positions. This means that clusters tend to overlap and merge with the overall swarm. By 2003 roughly a dozen <b>dynamical</b> families were identified. Jupiter-trojan families are much smaller in size than families in the asteroid belt; the largest identified family, the Menelaus group, consists of only eight members.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} <b>dynamical</b> systems {{is the focus}} of <b>dynamical</b> systems theory, which has {{applications}} {{to a wide variety of}} fields such as mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, economics, and medicine. <b>Dynamical</b> systems are a fundamental part of chaos theory, logistic map dynamics, bifurcation theory, the self-assembly process, and the edge of chaos concept.|$|E
25|$|In {{continuous}} time <b>dynamical</b> systems, chaos is {{the phenomenon}} of the spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry which is an intrinsic property of evolution operators of all stochastic and deterministic (partial) differential equations. This picture of <b>dynamical</b> chaos works not only for deterministic models but also for models with external noise, which is an important generalization from the physical point of view because in reality all <b>dynamical</b> systems experience influence from their stochastic environments. Within this picture, the long-range <b>dynamical</b> behavior associated with chaotic dynamics, e.g., the butterfly effect, is a consequence of the Goldstone's theorem in the application to the spontaneous topological supersymmetry breaking.|$|E

25|$|The <b>dynamical</b> Casimir {{effect is}} the {{production}} of particles and energy from an accelerated moving mirror. This reaction was predicted by certain numerical solutions to quantum mechanics equations made in the 1970s. In May 2011 an announcement was made {{by researchers at the}} Chalmers University of Technology, in Gothenburg, Sweden, of the detection of the <b>dynamical</b> Casimir effect. In their experiment, microwave photons were generated out of the vacuum in a superconducting microwave resonator. These researchers used a modified SQUID to change the effective length of the resonator in time, mimicking a mirror moving at the required relativistic velocity. If confirmed this would be the first experimental verification of the <b>dynamical</b> Casimir effect.|$|E
