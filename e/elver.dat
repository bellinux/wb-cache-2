[...] Soliquisto may be lost in memories but he's still canny. [...] (What My Public Wants) [...] The plot is fairly simple and endearingly odd, but the underlying ideas are more complex. [...] Basically, Stinkfoot is a portrait of the artist’s creative heart and mind. [...] Soliquisto believes what he has made must remain in his control or his art is lost. [...] By the end of Stinkfoot he realizes nothing is ever lost, that he can let his creations go, that once he (or she) has created something it takes {{on a life of its}} own, and that the artist can always make more. [...] (Only Being Myself) [...] With this lesson learned, Soliquisto, who has made nothing new since Stinkfoot disappeared, sees Elma the Electrifying <b>Elver</b> dancing on the beach.

40|$|Progressive {{epidermal}} pigmentation of Anguilla rostrata <b>elvers</b> in {{a coastal}} Rhode Island stream was essentially {{identical to that}} described for A. anguilla, and proceeded rapidly in freshwater. Earlier arriving <b>elvers</b> averaged larger than those arriving later in the season, paralleling studies of European <b>elvers.</b> Mean total lengths of <b>elvers</b> collected in 1984 were significantly greater than those for 1983 and are the largest recorded for the Western North Atlantic. These differences {{may be due to}} sampling technique. Migration of <b>elvers</b> into freshwater may be induced by decreasing flow rates and/or increasing stream temperatures. The relatively slow upstream migration of <b>elvers</b> in the lower section of the stream (approximately 200 m per month) is attributed to high stream gradient and the presence of obstructions. By late summer and early fall, <b>elvers</b> (age I+) had acquired the coloration typical of yellow eels and had grown 20 to 30 mm larger than <b>elvers</b> arriving in freshwater in late winter and spring. The frequency of II+ and older eels increased with increasing distance from the tidal zone. This indicates that the upstream migration of <b>elvers</b> is limited, and that the colonization of inland waters is accomplished mainly by yellow eels in their second and later years of continental life...|$|R

The growth of <b>elvers</b> and juveniles was much slower in freshwater {{than in the}} marine environment. - The food of <b>elvers</b> and juveniles consisted almost entirely of benthic insects. Dipteran larvae and annelid worms were the groups most frequently utilized as food. <b>Elvers</b> formed an appreciable part of the food supply of brook trout and large eels during the months of July, August and September. The food of <b>elvers</b> and juvenile eels corresponded closely to the benthic portion of the diet of small salmonids. [...] Late summer migrations of juveniles from the marine environment into freshwater were common {{in some areas of}} the island. These migrations contributed substantially to the eel population of some Newfoundland streams. ...|$|R

2500|$|Framestore {{also created}} the film's opening sequence. Despite {{appearing}} {{as a single}} shot, it ultimately was composed of 11 different visual effect shots. Gunn provided reference video for Baby Groot's dancing in the sequence. Framestore animation supervisor Arsland <b>Elver</b> noted {{that the majority of}} the opening sequence includes CGI and digital doubles, with three moments (Quill falling on the ground near Baby Groot, Gamora talking to Baby Groot, and Drax rolling behind Baby Groot) actually photography. As with the first film, Sarofsky created the typography for the opening, using the same style from Guardians of the Galaxy for consistency, [...] "this time in rusty gold and glowing blue neon". Executive Creative Director Erin Sarofsky noted the challenge of placing the credits while the sequence was being refined by Framestore. Sarofsky proposed several different options for the credits, including having [...] "a little hovering character that projected a hologram up on the screen", but Gunn did not want another character in the sequence to deal with. A simpler 2D option was used instead. Sarofsky also worked on the end credits, the first time for the company, integrating the actual credits from company Exceptional Minds with designs inspired by old music album art, taking albums and scanning them for their old textures and scratches.|$|E

40|$|Eel {{research}} broke {{new ground}} in 1973 by beginning {{a study of}} <b>elvers</b> and young eels. <b>Elvers</b> enter fresh water in spring and make their ways upriver. Precise information on when they arrive, in what numbers and how far they travel is very limited, although the subject was studied {{in the early years}} of the present century. Knowledge of the behaviour of eels in these early stages is essential because we have now proved that the scarcity of eels in many Irish waters is caused by the failure of the small eels to reach them. The situation could be improved by artificial transport of the young eels but first they must be caught and we must find out where and how best to catch them. In 1973 the arrival of <b>elvers</b> happened rather late and many were still on the move from the end of June right up to August. A study of the young eels at Parteen Weir on the River Shannon showed that there were virtually no <b>elvers</b> amongst them. This indicated that <b>elvers</b> took more than a year to travel distance of nine miles to Parteen from the top of the tide...|$|R
