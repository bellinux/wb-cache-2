While the toad is usually limited to areas with a constant supply of water, populations have begun to spread into drier places. Even though it has relative great range in Israel, a 55% decrease has been noted in active spawning sites, mainly due to destruction of habitats, water contamination and habitats being split by roads or train tracks. The population currently numbers at a few thousands.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Little {{attention}} has been paid to the consequences of the last landbridge between Africa and Sicily on Mediterranean biogeography. Previous paleontological and scarce molecular data suggest possible faunal exchange later than the well-documented landbridge in the Messinian (5. 3 My); however, a possible African origin of recent terrestrial Sicilian fauna has not been thoroughly tested with molecular methods. To gain insight into the phylogeography of the region, we examine two mitochondrial and two nuclear markers (one is a newly adapted intron marker) in <b>green</b> <b>toads</b> (Bufo viridis subgroup) across that sea barrier, the Strait of Sicily. Results Extensive sampling throughout the western Mediterranean and North Africa revealed a deep sister relationship between Sicilian (Bufo siculus n. sp.) and African <b>green</b> <b>toads</b> (B. boulengeri) on the mitochondrial and nuclear level. Divergence times estimated under a Bayesian-coalescence framework (mtDNA control region and 16 S rRNA) range from the Middle Pliocene (3. 6 My) to Pleistocene (0. 16 My) with an average (1. 83 to 2. 0 My) around the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary, suggesting possible land connections younger than the Messinian (5. 3 My). We describe <b>green</b> <b>toads</b> from Sicily and some surrounding islands as a new endemic species (Bufo siculus). Bufo balearicus occurs on some western Mediterranean islands (Corsica, Sardinia, Mallorca, and Menorca) and the Apennine Peninsula, and is well differentiated on the mitochondrial and nuclear level from B. siculus as well as from B. viridis (Laurenti), whose haplotype group reaches northeastern Italy, north of the Po River. Detection of Calabrian B. balearicus haplotypes in northeastern Sicily suggests recent invasion. Our data agree with paleogeographic and fossil data, which suggest long Plio-Pleistocene isolation of Sicily and episodic Pleistocene faunal exchange across the Strait of Messina. It remains unknown whether both species (B. balearicus, B. siculus) occur in sympatry in northern Sicily. Conclusion Our findings on <b>green</b> <b>toads</b> give the first combined mitochondrial and nuclear sequence evidence for a phylogeographic connection across the Strait of Sicily in terrestrial vertebrates. These relationships may have implications for comparative phylogeographic research on other terrestrial animals co-occurring in North Africa and Sicily. </p...|$|R
500|$|A study {{published}} in 2012 examined the phylogenetic relationships between the Eurasian and North African species in the Bufobufo group and indicated a long evolutionary history for the group. [...] Nine to thirteen million years ago, Bufoeichwaldi, a recently described species from south Azerbaijan and Iran, split from the main lineage. Further divisions occurred with Bufospinosus splitting off about five million {{years ago when the}} Pyrenees were being uplifted, an event which isolated the populations in the Iberian Peninsula from those in the rest of Europe. The remaining European lineage split into Bufobufo and Bufoverrucosissimus less than three million years ago during the Pleistocene.

40|$|Taxa {{involving}} three bisexually reproducing ploidy levels make <b>green</b> <b>toads</b> {{a unique}} amphibian system. We put a cytogenetic dataset from Central Asia in a molecular framework and apply phylogenetic and demographic methods {{to data from}} the entire Palearctic range. We study the mitochondrial relationships of diploids to infer their phylogeography and the maternal ancestry of polyploids. Control regions (and tRNAs between ND 1 and ND 2 in representatives) characterize a deeply branched assemblage of twelve haplotype groups, diverged since the Lower Miocene. Polyploidy has evolved several times: Central Asian tetraploids (B. oblongus, B. pewzowi) {{have at least two}} maternal origins. Intriguingly, the mitochondrial ancestor of morphologically distinctive, sexually reproducing triploid taxa (B. pseudoraddei) from Karakoram and Hindukush represents a different lineage. We report another potential case of bisexual triploid toads (B. zugmayeri). Identical d-loops in diploids and tetraploids from Iran and Turkmenistan, which differ in morphology, karyotypes and calls, suggest multiple origins and retained polymorphism and/or hybridization. A similar system involves diploids, triploids and tetraploids from Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan where <b>green</b> <b>toads</b> exemplify vertebrate genomic plasticity. A new form from Sicily and its African sister species (B. boulengeri) allow internal calibration and divergence time estimates for major clades.

40|$|Contrasting {{with birds}} and mammals, most ectothermic {{vertebrates}} present homomorphic sex chromosomes, {{which might be}} due either to a high turnover rate or to occasional X-Y recombination. We tested these two hypotheses {{in a group of}} Palearctic <b>green</b> <b>toads</b> that diverged some 3. 3 million years ago.

Phylogenetic analyses of sex-linked sequences show that X and Y alleles cluster by species, not by gametolog. We conclude that X-Y homomorphy and fine-scale sequence similarity in these species do not stem from recent sex-chromosome turnovers, but from occasional X-Y recombination. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{the current}} study focuses on genetic {{variations}} among different populations located in Israel under extremely different climates. Analysis of the three molecular markers, D-loop, Cyt b, and RAPD, indicated {{a high level of}} genetic similarity in Israeli <b>green</b> <b>toads,</b> except for the ecogeographical edge populations from Mount Hermon and the desert. Less clear results were obtained by the AFLP analysis, probably due to the low number of individuals sampled (Medina et al. 2006), as it is clear today that the greater the genetic variability among individuals in a particular area, the larger the sample size needed to capture it. The small size of samples examined in the present study of bufonids in Israel should be increased in future studies in order to identify the true ecogeographical correlates of bufonids.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Bufo viridis Laurenti, 1768 is {{a common}} species that inhabits {{a wide variety of}} habitats. The {{different}} climates characterising its broad range lead to a high degree of variability in its seasonal activity and reproductive cycle. This paper reports some observations carried out on the breeding phenology of this species over a two year period in Mediterranean temporary ponds in Sicily. The reproductive period of Sicil-ian <b>green</b> <b>toads</b> extends into the autumn months, making it longer than that of other Italian populations. This behaviour seems due to the impact of xeric environmental conditions on the seasonal activity of the studied populations. The present study con-firms that B. viridis is an opportunistic breeder with a wide margin of variability in annual reproductive cycle patterns, as would be expected of an ecologically variable species. The duration of the reproductive season varied between populations in the same year and between different years for the same population...|$|R
40|$|The Balearic Islands were {{populated}} by humans sometime between {{the second and}} fourth millennium BC. Palaeontology research shows {{that most of the}} current terrestrial vertebrates have been introduced and that almost all nonflying pre-human vertebrates are extinct, either through human predation or, in most cases, through impacts from introduced fauna. All terrestrial mammals (a small endemic bovid with continuously growing incisors, Myotragus – a giant dormouse, Hypnomys and a giant shrew, Nesiotites) disappeared a few centuries after the arrival of humans. Very few other vertebrates have survived. The endemic lizard from Mallorca and Minorca, Podarcis lilfordi, has been extirpated from the main islands and only survives on islets that have remained free of snakes and carnivores. In addition, the Mallorcan midwife toad, (Alytes muletensis) only survives in the few karst canyons.

40|$|The <b>green</b> <b>toads,</b> Bufo viridis {{breed in}} {{temporary}} desert ponds of variable duration and exhibit extreme plasticity in {{the timing of}} metamorphosis. Pond duration depended on initial depth and frequency of rainfall. Tadpoles in shorter duration ponds metamorphosed earlier than tadpoles in longer duration ponds. The larvae complete their development rapidly before the pond dried, but resulted in small size at metamorphosis. The effects of changing resource availability on the timing of metamorphosis were examined by raising the larvae in a factorial field experiment manipulating food level, larval density, and pond duration. At constant pond duration, tadpoles at constant high food level metamorphosed earlier at largest sizes. At low food level, tadpoles metamorphosed at a uniformly small size, but varied between treatments in {{the time required to}} reach that size. Tadpoles from both decreasing density and low food treatments metamorphosed earlier than tadpoles from increasing density and low food treatments. These results support the idea that tadpoles can respond adaptively to resource variation...|$|R
