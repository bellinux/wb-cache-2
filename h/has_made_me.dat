25|$|The marbles {{generally}} {{were very}} dirty...from a deposit {{of dust and}} soot....I found {{the body of the}} marble beneath the surface white....The application of water, applied by a sponge or soft cloth, removed the coarsest dirt....The use of fine, gritty powder, with the water and rubbing, though it more quickly removed the upper dirt, left much embedded in the cellular surface of the marble. I then applied alkalies, both carbonated and caustic; these quickened the loosening of the surface dirt...but they fell far short of restoring the marble surface to its proper hue and state of cleanliness. I finally used dilute nitric acid, and even this failed....The examination <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> despair of the possibility of presenting the marbles in the British Museum in that state of purity and whiteness which they originally possessed.|$|E

Written by Nick Doody and Matt Kirshen, performed with zest by a sparkling cast. Bound to become a cult."

After {{discovering}} Sia's music online, Guetta picked her to appear on his fifth studio album, Nothing but the Beat. Guetta told an insider from Los Angeles, [...] "I was totally amazed by Sia...This <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> more curious to study her music more because I was really impressed. I have the biggest people on the album {{and she has a}} different profile, more like an indie kind of artist and it makes her song even more special, it makes it stand out I think." ...|$|E
500|$|For the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990, Madonna and her {{supporting}} dancers Niki Haris and Donna De Lory {{were dressed}} as old women in fluffy dressing gowns with dollar signs and curling pins in their hair. Singing the song {{with a strong}} mid-western accent, they got up and revealed a frivolish pink dress underneath their gown, in which they danced around. On some dates Madonna replaced the words [...] "experience <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> rich" [...] with [...] "experience <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> a bitch". After singing, she produced dollar bills out of her corsage and threw {{them up in the}} air for the audience to catch. Two different performances were taped and released on video, Blond Ambition: Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990. During the Re-Invention World Tour of 2004, a general setlist was decided where the show rehearsals would start with [...] "I'm So Stupid" [...] from American Life, [...] "Dress You Up" [...] and [...] "Material Girl". But [...] "Dress You Up" [...] and [...] "I'm So Stupid" [...] were later dropped from the show. Hence [...] "Material Girl" [...] was transferred as the closing song of the military segment of the show, and was re-arranged as an electric guitar version. Madonna wore military themed clothes and sang the song while {{standing in front of a}} microphone and playing an electric guitar. The backdrops displayed mathematical equations along with DNA helixes rushing through the screens.|$|E
500|$|She became {{well known}} in {{geological}} circles in Britain, Europe, and America, and was consulted on issues of anatomy as well as about collecting fossils. Nonetheless, as a woman, she was not eligible to join the Geological Society of London {{and she did not}} always receive full credit for her scientific contributions. Indeed, she wrote in a letter: [...] "The world has used me so unkindly, I fear it <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> suspicious of everyone." [...] The only scientific writing of hers published in her lifetime appeared in the Magazine of Natural History in 1839, an extract from a letter that Anning had written to the magazine's editor questioning one of its claims.|$|E

500|$|PedroII {{regarded}} {{the death of}} his son as [...] "the most fatal blow that I could ever receive, and certainly I would not have survived were it not that I still have a wife and two children". The Emperor wrote to his brother-in-law Dom FernandoII, King-consort of Portugal: [...] "By the time you receive this, you will certainly have learnt of the grievous loss I have undergone... God who <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> pass though so hard a testing, will in his mercy give me grounds to console my sorrows." [...] PedroII had already lost another son, Dom Afonso, almost three years earlier. He revealed his inner turmoil in a sonnet: [...] "Twice already I have suffered death, for the father dies who sees his son is dead." [...] Except for brief inspection visits, the Emperor avoided Santa Cruz thereafter.|$|E
500|$|... "That song -- {{the last}} one I wrote for the record -- is {{definitely}} the most representative of me now, the way that I feel. If we're talking about the 'new me,' that's it and why it's {{at the end of}} the record. You have to go through those things and make the changes you have to make and be there and go, 'Okay, I did it.' It doesn't come that easy. [...] I just didn't hold back this time, and writing that way <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel really purified, like I've actually gotten a chance to break through instead of just wallowing in all of my problems. It's not about all the times that I've been afraid and tormented and sad, it's about looking at those situations and stomping them out. It feels really good to sing these songs now." ...|$|E
500|$|Anime News Network {{had four}} editors review {{the first episode}} of the anime: Carl Kimlinger {{expressed}} doubts about {{the premise of the}} show, but liked the over-saturated visuals and the concept of the protagonists cheating against cheaters; Rebecca Silverman called the characters unlikeable and criticized the expositions for lacking in action, but noted her issues may be resolved in further episodes; and Theron Martin described the plot as wish-fulfilment, noted Sora has too much character for a hikikomori, called Sora's relationship with Shiro creepy, and concluded the series may turn out well if Sora is not an indomitable character. The fourth reviewer, Hope Chapman, expressed absolute disdain towards the series. She expressed hatred towards Sora's character, noting the misunderstood nerd turned respected genius aspect is lazy wish-fulfillment and how he thrives in a world for [...] "misanthropic Shut-ins". Chapman likened the over-saturated colors to vomit, called the character designs hideous, and concluded her review with [...] "nothing <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> roll my eyes, gag, or feel more irrationally angry this season than this insulting self-insert pandering trash heap".|$|E

500|$|During {{his student}} years Bruce built up his {{knowledge}} of the natural sciences and oceanography, by studying at summer courses under distinguished tutors such as Patrick Geddes and John Arthur Thomson. He also spent time working voluntarily under the oceanographer Dr John Murray, helping to classify specimens collected during the Challenger expedition. In 1892 Bruce gave up his medical studies altogether, and embarked on a voyage to the Antarctic in the whaler Balaena, as part of the 1892–93 Dundee Whaling Expedition. On his return, he began organising an expedition of his own to South Georgia, claiming that [...] "the taste I have had <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> ravenous", but he could not obtain funding. He then worked at a meteorological station on the summit of Ben Nevis, before joining the Jackson–Harmsworth Arctic Expedition to Franz Josef Land as a scientific assistant. Between 1897 and 1899 he made further Arctic trips, to Spitsbergen and to Novaya Zemlya, first on a private trip organised by Major Andrew Coats, later as a scientist on the Arctic survey vessel Princess Alice. This vessel was owned by Prince Albert of Monaco, a renowned oceanographer who became a friend and supporter of Bruce.|$|E
500|$|The {{movement}} is structured like a prelude and fugue, the prelude covering {{the beginning of}} the biblical verse, the fugue the anguish of the Lord's wrath. The [...] "prelude" [...] begins with 16 measures of instrumental music, with the strings [...] "engaged in a persistent sobbing commentary", as John Eliot Gardiner puts it, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000 and performed this cantata in the Brunswick Cathedral. In the second round of vocal entries, each part is intensified by a wind instruments. The musicologist Julian Mincham notes about Bach's different ways to convey the distress of the text: [...] "There is frequent stressing of the word [...] "Schmerz" [...] (sorrow). Suspensions and dissonant seventh chords in the harmony add to the tension as do the uses of the highly expressive Neapolitan chord and false relations". The fugue, marked [...] "Un poco allegro", covers {{the second part of the}} verse, translating to [...] "For the Lord <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> full of anguish on the day of his wrathful anger." [...] The fugue builds from two vocal parts and continuo to nine parts. Gardiner writes: [...] "It is uncompromising in its contrapuntal wildness and grim, dissonant harmony." ...|$|E
500|$|Kids Can Say No! {{was made}} in London with input from Carolyn Okell Jones, an expert on child abuse, and was filmed on Hampstead Heath in 1985. The child actors were {{students}} at the Barbara Speake Stage School. Skippon directed and produced the film. Funding was difficult because neither the Department of Health and Social Security nor the Home Office considered the film under their jurisdiction, and each office referred Skippon to the other. Childwatch, a charitable organisation, donated £15,000 and technical facilities were provided by Barclays Bank Video. Harris covered {{the rest of the}} film's production costs and American children's songwriter Peter Alsop wrote the theme song. American Anita Bennett wrote the script, which was reviewed and approved by a NSPCC committee. Kids Can Say No! was the second film from Rolf Harris Video, an educational video production company Harris founded in 1980. In an interview, he said that his role of talking with children about sexual abuse in the film was a natural one because [...] "my track record <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> a believable person. I have never betrayed the kids' trust".|$|E

500|$|On August 22, 2015, Beholder {{became the}} first filly or mare to win the Grade I Pacific Classic against males. She won by [...] lengths with a final time of 1:59.77, against an {{otherwise}} all-male field of nine other horses, including 2014 Breeders' Cup Classic winner Bayern. She won in the third-fastest winning {{time in the history}} of the race, and with the second-largest margin of victory, behind the 2013 win of Game On Dude. Hughes said: [...] "She’s the first horse who <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel lucky to be her owner." [...] Mandella quipped, [...] "We didn’t think she would do it quite like that. We thought it was the girls she was picking on." [...] and added later, [...] "I think the boys pissed her off. I think they were telling sexist jokes on the backside." [...] After the race, her [...] connections announced that she would train with the goal of running in the Breeders' Cup Classic. [...] They also suggested that she might race again in 2016 and that upon retirement, Hughes would be likely to keep her at his Spendthrift Farm and not offer her for sale.|$|E
500|$|The Romantic poets {{were more}} profoundly {{affected}} by Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark than anyone, except perhaps Godwin. The poet Robert Southey, for example, {{wrote to his}} publisher: [...] "Have you met with Mary Wollstonecraft's ? She <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> {{in love with a}} cold climate, and frost and snow, with a northern moonlight." [...] The book's combination of progressive social views with the advocacy of individual subjective experience influenced writers such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Wollstonecraft's [...] "incarnational theory of the creative imagination" [...] paved the way for Wordsworth's thorough treatment of the imagination and its relation to the self in BookV of The Prelude (1805; 1850). Her book also had a significant influence on Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1797–99) and Percy Shelley's Alastor (1815); their depictions of [...] "quest for a settled home" [...] strongly resemble Wollstonecraft's. The most striking homage to Wollstonecraft's work, however, is in Coleridge's famous poem [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] (1797; 1816). Not only does much of his style descend from the book, but at one point he alludes to Wollstonecraft as he is describing a cold wasteland: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{relatively}} short expedition—Bruce {{was back in}} Scotland in May 1893—failed in its main purpose, and gave only limited opportunities for scientific work. No right whales were found, and to cut the expedition's losses a mass slaughter of seals was ordered, to secure skins, oil and blubber. Bruce found this distasteful, especially as {{he was expected to}} share in the killing. The scientific output from the voyage was, in Bruce's words [...] "a miserable show". In a letter to the Royal Geographical Society he wrote: [...] "The general bearing of the master (Captain Fairweather) was far from being favourable to scientific work". Bruce was denied access to charts, so was unable to establish the accurate location of phenomena. He was required to work [...] "in the boats" [...] when he should have been making meteorological and other observations, and no facilities were allowed him for the preparation of specimens, many of which were lost through careless handling by the crew. Nevertheless, his letter to the RGS ends: [...] "I have to thank the Society for assisting me in what has been, despite all drawbacks, an instructive and delightful experience." [...] In a further letter to Mill he outlined his wishes to go South again, adding: [...] "the taste I have had <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> ravenous".|$|E
