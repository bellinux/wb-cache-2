40|$|This paper uses a {{new concept}} in wavelet {{analysis}} to explore a financial transaction data set including returns, <b>durations,</b> <b>and</b> volume. The concept {{is based on a}} decomposition of the Allan covariance of two series into cross-covariances of wavelet coefficients, which allows a natural interpretation of cross-correlations in terms of frequencies. It is applied to financial transaction data including returns, <b>durations</b> between transactions, <b>and</b> trading volume. At high frequencies, we find significant spillover from <b>durations</b> to volume <b>and</b> a strong contemporaneous relation between <b>durations</b> <b>and</b> returns, whereas a strong causality between volume and volatility exists at various frequencies...|$|R

50|$|Explicit modeling: {{this feature}} means that, rather than {{assuming}} a volatility a priori and computing prices from it, {{one can use}} the model to solve for volatility, which gives the implied volatility of an option at given prices, <b>durations</b> <b>and</b> exercise prices. Solving for volatility over a given set of <b>durations</b> <b>and</b> strike prices, one can construct an implied volatility surface. In this application of the Black-Scholes model, a coordinate transformation from the price domain to the volatility domain is obtained. Rather than quoting option prices in terms of dollars per unit (which are hard to compare across strikes, <b>durations</b> <b>and</b> coupon frequencies), option prices can thus be quoted in terms of implied volatility, which leads to trading of volatility in option markets.|$|R

5|$|Alex Weldon {{was hired}} to be {{supervisor}} of special effects for the film.

When Weldon was hired, many of the effects had already been started or completed by Rugg; it was up to Weldon to complete more complex and higher-budgeted effects for the motion picture. The first step of preparation involved analyzing the script in the number, <b>duration,</b> <b>and</b> type of effects.

5|$|By late on December4, the NHC was {{no longer}} anticipating extratropical transition, after a front passed north of the storm {{and there was no}} interaction. At 0600UTC on December5, the hurricane's {{appearance}} generated 4.7 on the Dvorak technique, a system used to estimate intensity from satellite imagery. This was the highest rating during Epsilon's <b>duration,</b> <b>and</b> suggested winds of 85mph (140km/h), which was its peak intensity. Around that time, the hurricane began a turn to the east-southeast, as the ridge to its north built behind the passage of a cold front. Despite the cold water temperatures and unfavorable strong upper-level winds, Epsilon maintained its intensity, and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) model predicted it would remain a hurricane for nearly three days.|$|E
40|$|Data of {{the flank}} eruptions of Etna from {{over the last}} 400 years were {{extracted}} from the new geological map for the lava flow extensions and vent positions, and from the catalogs of historical eruptions for the eruption <b>durations</b> <b>and</b> lava volumes. The partially or widely hidden lava fields on the new geological map were retrieved from older geological maps. The distributions of the eruption <b>durations</b> <b>and</b> lava volumes were analyzed, with the definition of six eruptive classes for use in numerical simulations. The threshold values for the eruption <b>durations</b> <b>and</b> lava volumes were set at 45 days and at 35 × 106 m 3 and 100 × 106 m 3, respectively. A global analysis {{was performed on the}} whole volcano to evaluate the recurrence of the classes, and to estimate for each class the ranges, {{means and standard deviations of}} the <b>durations,</b> volumes <b>and</b> elevations of the main vent. The same analysis was repeated by subdividing the volcano into three sectors, which were defined on the basis of the distribution of the eruptive fissures over the last 15 ka. The classes have different recurrences across these various sectors, and different distributions of volumes, <b>durations</b> <b>and</b> elevations of the main vent. Finally, a lava flow resurfacing map that counts the number of lava flows on each given area of the volcano over the last 400 years was compiled and then normalized...|$|R

5|$|Certain diamond {{enhancement}} {{techniques are}} commonly used to artificially produce an array of colors, including blue, green, yellow, red, and black. Color enhancement techniques usually involve irradiation, including proton bombardment via cyclotrons; neutron bombardment in the piles of nuclear reactors; and electron bombardment by Van de Graaff generators. These high-energy particles physically alter the diamond's crystal lattice, knocking carbon atoms out of place and producing color centers. The depth of color penetration depends on the technique and its <b>duration,</b> <b>and</b> {{in some cases the}} diamond may be left radioactive to some degree.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{distance}} {{away from any}} major land masses, Carrie caused relatively minor damage along its path. On September16, the hurricane passed well north of Bermuda, causing minimal damage despite its intensity at the time, though hurricane reconnaissance flights in the area were postponed due to damage sustained {{by one of the}} aircraft. As it was transitioning to an extratropical cyclone southwest of the Azores, the German ship Pamir encountered the storm and capsized on September21, resulting in the deaths of 80crew members on board. As an extratropical storm, Carrie brought strong storm surge and heavy rain to the British Isles, which claimed three lives. The hurricane's long <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> path in open water also helped it attain a number of Atlantic hurricane records.|$|E
5|$|<b>Duration</b> <b>and</b> {{frequencies}} of the sejms changed over time, with the six-week sejm session convened {{every two years}} being most common. Sejm locations changed throughout history, eventually with the Commonwealth capital of Warsaw emerging as the primary location.

Early sejms have seen mostly majority voting, but beginning in the 17th century, unanimous voting became more common, and 32 sejms were vetoed with the infamous liberum veto, particularly {{in the first half}} of the 18th century. This vetoing procedure has been credited with significantly paralyzing the Commonwealth governance.|$|E
