5|$|Between 1841 and 1846, he {{published}} Beniowski, {{considered by some}} his best lyrical poetry. Starting as {{a story of a}} historical figure, it developed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> of the poet's own life and opinions. In 1842 he joined the religious-philosophical group, Koło Sprawy Bożej (Circle of God's Cause), led by Andrzej Towiański. This group included, among others, Mickiewicz. Towiański's influence is credited with a new, mystical current in Słowacki's works, seen in works such as the poem Beniowski and the drama Ksiądz Marek (Father Mark). Słowacki left the Circle a year later, in 1843.|$|E
5|$|In {{describing}} the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's {{philosophy of the}} sensations, which argued that the senses were the origin of ideas. Information described {{in the beginning of}} the poem is reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political philosophy as it emphasises the inevitability and finality of death. The end of the poem is connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning of the poem deals with the senses and the ending describes how we are limited in our ability to understand the world. The poem takes the ideas and transforms them <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution to be content with our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator of the poem knows that he is unable to fathom the universe, but still questions the matter.|$|E
5|$|Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement is a poem {{written by}} English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1796. Like his earlier poem The Eolian Harp, the poem {{discusses}} Coleridge's understanding {{of nature and}} his married life, which was suffering from problems that developed after the previous poem. Overall, the poem focuses on humanity's relationship with nature in its various aspects ranging from experiencing an Edenic state to having to abandon a unity with nature {{in order to fulfill}} a moral obligation to humanity. The discussion of man's obligation to each other leads <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> on the difference between the life of a philosopher and the life of a poet. By the end of the poem, the narrator follows the philosophical path {{in a manner similar to}} what Coleridge sought to do. The response to the poem from critics was mostly positive with many of them emphasizing the religious aspects of the poem in their analysis.|$|E

25|$|This leads <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> {{about the}} merits of the debate whether the {{universe}} is eternal or created. As in the first book, Aristotle's theory of the eternity of the universe is seen as the best, philosophically. However, this is because Maimonides considered the proofs that the universe was created to be inferior. He still points out supposed problems with the Aristotelian view and states that, while Aristotle's argument is the best, the possession of Divine Revelation from the Torah is the extra piece of information necessary to decide the matter.|$|E
25|$|One of {{principal}} seats of Babylonian Judaism was Nehardea, {{which was then}} a very large city made up mostly of Jews. A very ancient synagogue, built, it was believed, by King Jehoiachin, existed in Nehardea. At Huzal, near Nehardea, there was another synagogue, not far from which could be seen the ruins of Ezra's academy. In the period before Hadrian, Akiba, on his arrival at Nehardea on a mission from the Sanhedrin, entered <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> with a resident scholar on a point of matrimonial law (Mishnah Yeb., end). At {{the same time there}} was at Nisibis (northern Mesopotamia), an excelling Jewish college, at the head of which stood Judah ben Bathyra, and in which many Judean scholars found refuge {{at the time of the}} persecutions. A certain temporary importance was also attained by a school at Nehar-Peḳod, founded by the Judean immigrant Hananiah, nephew of Joshua ben Hananiah, which school might have been the cause of a schism between the Jews of Babylonia and those of Judea-Israel, had not the Judean authorities promptly checked Hananiah's ambition.|$|E
500|$|The poem {{begins by}} {{summarising}} {{the themes of}} The Prelude, and develops <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> of Wordsworth's understanding of his beliefs and their relationship with nature. In the poem, Coleridge is self-critical in a near masochistic manner, holding [...] his poetry and thoughts as inferior to Wordsworth. This is partly because Coleridge believed that Wordsworth {{was able to find}} bliss from solitude while he was unable to find anything but pain. Coleridge discusses his youthful hopes to become a great poet and how his ability to write has diminished over time. The poem's admiration of Wordsworth's ability is rendered without jealousy, though he is scornful of his own.|$|E

I have to ask what's wrong with him. I want to see Bernie next week and ask him what is the reason." [...] Speaking about hitting the pit bollard at his stop, Carlos Sainz Jr. said it had been a [...] "rookie error" [...] due to his urgency to overtake Pastor Maldonado during the pit stops. Daniil Kvyat, who finished 13th after starting in the pit lane complained about the race, saying: [...] "It was pretty boring for me out there this afternoon because a combination of circumstances meant I had to just sit back and was unable to attack. [...] In the end, I did manage to overtake some people, but it wasn't great. It's frustrating and annoying, but there was nothing I could do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera was a Spanish-born philosopher who pursued {{reconciliation}} between Jewish dogma and philosophy. [...] Scholars speculate {{he was a}} student of Rabbi David Kimhi whose family fled Spain to Narbonne. Ibn Falaquera lived an ascetic live of solitude. [...] Ibn Falaquera's two leading philosophic authorities were Averroes and Maimonides. [...] Ibn Falaquera defended the [...] "Guide for the Perplexed" [...] against attacks of anti-Maimonideans. [...] He knew the works of the Islamic philosophers better than any Jewish scholar of his time, and made many of them available to other Jewish scholars – often without attribution (Reshit Hokhmah). [...] Ibn Falaquera did not hesitate to modify Islamic philosophic texts when it suited his purposes. For example, Ibn Falaquera turned Alfarabi's account of the origin of philosophic religion <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> of the origin of the [...] "virtuous city". [...] Ibn Falaquera's other works include, {{but are not limited to}} Iggeret Hanhagat ha-Guf we ha-Nefesh, a treatise in verse on the control of the body and the soul.|$|E

When the two next appear before the council together, the elder Gustav the Short and Curly and Kröd gets into an argument over whether one should have pubic hair atop their heads. In the final, one-minute clip, Kröd expresses anger upon learning of the Pagan village attack: [...] "They can raid our villages, they can burn our crops, they can steal our cattle, but I refuse {{to live in a world}} where good men are shot in the anuses!"

2500|$|On March 10, 1900, {{after eight}} months of lay preaching under the Methodist Episcopal Church, Bishop James M. Thoburn ordained Zamora a deacon in the very place where he first preached in July 1899. In the First District Conference held on 20–23 August 1900, Zamora {{reported}} that his evangelistic work had reached seven places, with eight weekly services, 220 probationary members, seven Filipino workers, seven baptisms, and 38 marriages. In 1902, he preached at one thanksgiving service that was attended by more than 12,000 people. The audience included Bishop Gregorio Aglipay and Isabelo de los Reyes of the Philippine Independent Church, a church that held some one million members at the time. In the same year, while preaching the Gospel at Caloocan, he was drawn <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> by Father Valentin Tangag. Since the Catholic priest was unable to cite a topic for discussion, Zamora chose sainthood and the futility of prayers to the saints. Tangag was again unable to rebut Zamora's points, and thus retreated to his convent. The following Sunday, with more than 2,000 people eager to witness the discussion, Zamora brought his Bibles (which included the translation of Father Scio Torres Amat, the Latin Vulgate, the Hebrew, and the Greek) to Fr. Tangag. The latter had not left his convent to continue the discussion, but when he saw Zamora, he attempted to land a punch on Zamora's face. While Zamora was able to dodge the direct blow, the people with him wanted to avenge the attack. It was avoided for the priest was quick to retreat to his convent. All people present shouted in unison, [...] "Viva Cristo y su Evangelio" [...] (Long live the Christ and His Gospel).|$|E
2500|$|An {{online survey}} which {{recruited}} participants {{over the internet}} concluded that prior {{to the arrival of}} widespread computer networking, most zoophiles would not have known other zoophiles, and for the most part, zoophiles engaged in bestiality secretly, or told only trusted friends, family or partners. The internet and its predecessors made people able to search for information on topics which were not otherwise easily accessible and to communicate with relative safety and anonymity. Because of the diary-like intimacy of blogs and the anonymity of the internet, zoophiles had the ideal opportunity to [...] "openly" [...] express their sexuality. As with many other alternate lifestyles, broader networks began forming in the 1980s when participating in networked social groups became more common at home and elsewhere. Such developments in general were described by Markoff in 1990; the linking of computers meant that people thousands of miles apart could feel the intimacy akin to being in a small village together. The popular newsgroup alt.sex.bestiality, said to be in the top 1% of newsgroup interest (i.e. number 50 out of around 5000), – and reputedly started in humor – along with personal bulletin boards and talkers, chief among them Sleepy's multiple worlds, Lintilla, and Planes of Existence, were among the first group media of this kind in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These groups rapidly drew together zoophiles, some of whom also created personal and social websites and internet forums. By around 1992–1994, the wide social net had evolved. This was initially centered around the above-mentioned newsgroup, alt.sex.bestiality, which during the six years following 1990 had matured <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> and support group. The newsgroup included information about health issues, laws governing zoophilia, bibliography relating to the subject, and community events. Since the 1990s, other zoophile websites have been created and have grown in size; for example, the zoophile website and internet forum [...] "beastforum.com" [...] has more than one million members as of March 2012.|$|E
