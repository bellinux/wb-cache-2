50|$|Early {{technical}} <b>pens</b> (<b>ruling</b> <b>pens)</b> {{consisted of}} a small pair of calipers, having one flat and one bowed leg holding ink between them. By adjusting {{the gap between the}} legs the width of the line drawn by the pen could be adjusted. Such pens, kept at a constant angle to the paper, were used for <b>ruling</b> <b>lines,</b> but not for cursive handwriting, nor for off-hand flourishes. The Graphos technical pen introduced in 1934 miniaturized the caliper principle and made the points easily interchangeable. The Sheaffer company produced an expensive drafting set which included such pens for use on linen prints. These sets were often presented to a draftsperson upon completing 'time served', which marked the end of the apprenticeship.|$|R
50|$|Although stylographs never overtook {{fountain}} pens {{for use in}} writing, by 1953 the Rotring Rapidograph became the prototypical technical pen of its age. Its technology virtually replaced the <b>ruling</b> <b>pen</b> and greatly simplified technical drawing. Rapidographs are still made today, both by Rotring and by Koh-i-Noor, its US subsidiary.|$|R

50|$|In the 17th century, a stylus {{that could}} {{draw a line}} with a {{specific}} width called a <b>ruling</b> <b>pen</b> was developed. The stylus had two curved metal pieces which were joined by a screw. Ink was trickled between the blades, from which it flowed evenly across the paper. The basic model was maintained for a long time, with minor modifications, until the 1930s when the German technical drawing pens came to the market.|$|R

50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>Line</b> Automatic Signalling {{is a form}} of railway {{signalling}} used on {{the majority}} of <b>double</b> <b>line</b> sections in New Zealand. <b>Double</b> <b>Line</b> Automatic Signalling uses track circuits to detect the presence of trains in sections broken up by intermediate signals. Usually there is an 'up' and a 'down' main line, and beyond station limits the lines are not bi-directionally signalled. DLAS is not designed for wrong-line running in emergency situations.|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare the effects of two types of drip {{irrigation}} line design on cotton yield, water use, and net returns. The experiments were {{carried out in the}} arid region of Xinjiang, Northwest China, during 2009 - 2010 growing years. The two types of lateral placement are commonly used by the local farmers in the area: <b>double</b> <b>lines</b> (two laterals controlling four rows) and single line designs (one lateral controlling four rows). The results indicated that less irrigation water was applied by single <b>line</b> compared with <b>double</b> <b>lines</b> design. This implies that more irrigation water could be saved using single line, by reducing the water consumption of cotton. The emergence rates for <b>double</b> <b>lines</b> were 2 and 6 % higher than those for single line design in 2009 and 2010. The seed cotton yields for <b>double</b> <b>lines</b> design were 5. 76 and 6. 41 Mg ha(- 1) which were 13 and 9 % higher than for single line design in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Single lines could however lower the investment cost compared to <b>double</b> <b>lines,</b> which produced 10 and 7 % more net income in 2009 and 2010, respectively. By contrast, the <b>double</b> <b>lines</b> was more profitable and suitable for the farmers in Northwest China than single line design...|$|R
