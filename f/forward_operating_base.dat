5|$|After {{four weeks}} at the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) in Fort Polk, Louisiana, Manning was {{deployed}} to <b>Forward</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Base</b> Hammer, near Baghdad, arriving in October 2009. From her workstation there, she {{had access to}} SIPRNet (the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network) and JWICS (the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System). Two of her superiors had discussed not taking her to Iraq; it was felt she was a risk to herself and possibly others, according to a statement later issued by the Army—but the shortage of intelligence analysts dictated their decision to take her. In November 2009, she was promoted from Private First Class to Specialist.|$|E
5|$|A Special Forces Task Group (SFTG) was {{deployed}} to Afghanistan in August or September 2005, {{operating in the}} southern province of Uruzgan. The SFTG consisted of elements from the SASR, 4 RAR (Commando), the Incident Response Regiment (IRR) and logistic support personnel. Two CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment were {{deployed to}} Afghanistan in March 2006 to support the SFTG. A <b>forward</b> <b>operating</b> <b>base</b> was subsequently established at Tarin Kowt. This task group was withdrawn in September 2006, {{after a year of}} operations working closely with special forces from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. During this period the task group was on patrol for 306 days, involved in 139 contacts, and sustained 11 soldiers wounded. The SFTG was replaced by a Reconstruction Taskforce made up of engineers and conventional infantry.|$|E
5|$|The Brigade {{spent the}} first six months of its {{deployment}} to Tikrit in central Iraq, working on projects there for Multinational Division-Center under the 10th Mountain Division. On 6 November, the brigade relocated to Kirkuk, unfurling its colors at <b>Forward</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Base</b> Warrior. The brigade conducted route clearance and construction projects in northern Iraq, while partnered with Iraqi engineers. It replaced the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division in Kirkuk and will was under the area of responsibility of Multinational Division-North led by the 1st Armored Division. In February 2009, the brigade again moved, this time to Ninewa Province to focus on construction projects in areas in and around Mosul. It was relieved by 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division. On 17 July 2009, the brigade handed over responsibility of Mosul to the 130th Engineer Brigade. The brigade subsequently returned to Schwetzingen, Germany after its 15-month deployment was finished.|$|E

5|$|The Camp Chapman {{attack was}} a suicide attack by Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi against the Central Intelligence Agency {{facility}} inside <b>Forward</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Base</b> Chapman on December 30, 2009. FOB Chapman is located near the eastern Afghanistan city of Khost, which is about 10 miles northwest of the border with Pakistan. One of the main tasks of the CIA personnel stationed at the base was to provide intelligence supporting drone attacks against targets in Pakistan. Seven American CIA officers and contractors, an officer of Jordan's intelligence service, and an Afghan working for the CIA were killed when al-Balawi detonated a bomb sewn into a vest he was wearing. Six other American CIA officers were wounded. The bombing was the most lethal attack against the CIA in more than 25 years.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{was seriously}} {{weakened}} by five days hiding from NVA forces {{with little to}} eat. Following the instructions of the FAC controller overhead, he floated down the cold river and at about 2-3:00a.m., just as Norris {{was about to leave}} cover to pull Clark to shore, a six-man NVA patrol walked between them. Norris refrained from opening fire, recognizing this would compromise the covert mission and that they were outgunned. When the patrol was gone, so was Clark. Norris radioed Clark and instructed him {{to get out of the}} river on the south bank. On his own initiative, Norris left his team and on his own searched the river for Clark for several hours before finally finding Clark hiding behind a sampan on the riverbank. Norris was able to re-link up with the rest of his team and safely deliver Clark to Anderson at the <b>forward</b> <b>operating</b> <b>base.</b> Clark was transported to the last outpost on the Cua Viet River at Dong Ha by an ARVN M113 armored personnel carrier and then flown to Da Nang.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in August 2005 an Australian Special Forces Task Group (SFTG) was {{deployed}} to Afghanistan {{as part of}} Operation Slipper, operating in the southern province of Uruzgan. The SFTG, based on similar structure deployed during Operation Falconer, {{was made up of}} elements from the SASR, a commando company and a troop from the Incident Response Regiment. Two CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment were {{deployed to}} Afghanistan in March 2006 to support the SFTG. A <b>forward</b> <b>operating</b> <b>base</b> was subsequently established at Tarin Kowt. During this deployment the Commandos were involved in Operation Perth which resulted in the death of over 150 Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters in nine days of fierce fighting in the Chora district of Uruzgan Province. The SFTG was withdrawn from Afghanistan in September 2006 and replaced by a Reconstruction Taskforce made up of engineers and conventional infantry. During this period the task group was on patrol for 306 days and involved in 139 contacts and sustained 11 soldiers wounded.|$|E

5|$|On 16 June 2006, {{the unit}} was reorganized and redesignated the 36th Engineer Brigade. and reassigned to Fort Hood, Texas as the United States Army’s first modular {{engineer}} brigade headquarters. The brigade deployed to Afghanistan {{in support of}} Operation Enduring Freedom in 2007, holding a ceremony at III Corps Headquarters, casing its unit colors in preparation for its deployment on 28 February 2007. The brigade supports operations conducted by the 82nd Airborne Division. It is part of Task Force Rugged, and among its duties are training Afghan citizens in skilled labor and other nationbuilding operations. Most of the brigade served in Afghanistan since February 2007, while {{other elements of the}} unit served in Iraq. While in Afghanistan, the brigade headquarters were stationed at <b>Forward</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Base</b> Sharana. It also began to undertake missions against Improvised Explosive Devices, a problem which had originated in Iraq but since became more of a threat in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the perceived threat, the U.S. Atlantic Fleet prepared a plan to defend the east coast from attacks by aerial raiders and missiles. This plan was originally code-named 'Operation Bumblebee', and later renamed 'Operation Teardrop'. Completed on 6 January 1945, the plan involved U.S.Navy anti-submarine forces as well as United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and Army units, which were responsible for shooting down attacking aircraft and missiles. The centerpiece of the plan was the formation of two large naval task forces {{to operate in the}} mid-Atlantic as a barrier against submarines approaching the east coast. These task forces were formed from several existing escort carrier groups, and used Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, as their <b>forward</b> <b>operating</b> <b>base.</b> As well as guarding against missile attacks, these large forces were tasked with countering the new and high-performance Type XXI submarines if they began operating in the central Atlantic. The AtlanticFleet's commander, Vice Admiral Jonas H. Ingram, gave a press conference on 8 January in which he warned there was a threat of missile attack and announced that a large force had been assembled to counter seaborne missile launchers.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a Reconstruction Taskforce (RTF) based {{around the}} 1st Combat Engineer Regiment with {{protective}} elements from the 5/7 RAR, 6 RAR and 2nd Cavalry Regiment began arriving in Uruzgan Province in southern Afghanistan in early September 2006 {{as part of}} Operation Slipper. The RTF formed part of a Dutch-led Provincial Reconstruction Team, operating as part of Task Force Uruzgan and based at <b>Forward</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Base</b> Ripley, outside of Tarin Kowt. However, as the Australian commitment expanded, by 2010 the task force had evolved into a combined arms battalion-sized battle group consisting of infantry, engineers, cavalry, artillery and logistic elements, usually based on {{a unit of the}} Royal Australian Regiment. Known as the Mentoring Task Force (MTF), it formed part of a multinational brigade known as Combined Team Uruzgan and was tasked with counter-insurgency operations in conjunction with United States and other coalition forces. Partnered with the 4th Brigade, 205th Corps of the Afghan National Army (ANA), it operated throughout Uruzgan Province. While attached to MTF-1, soldiers from Combat Team Delta (based on D Company, 6 RAR) took part in heavy fighting during the Battle of Derapet in Deh Rahwod on 24 August 2010. Corporal Daniel Keighran was later awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia {{for his role in the}} battle, the first member of the Royal Australian Regiment to receive the award. The task force was withdrawn in late 2013 following the handover of the province to Afghan forces, although a small force protection element remains as part of the ongoing but reduced Australian training and advisory mission. Twelve members of the regiment have been killed in Afghanistan.|$|E
