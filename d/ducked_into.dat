2500|$|At Sydney, Terry Jenner retired {{hurt when}} he <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> a short {{delivery}} from Snow {{in the first}} innings. Umpire Lou Rowan warned the fast bowler for intimidatory bowling yet again, but Snow and Illingworth objected strongly, the captain saying [...] "That's the only bouncer he's bowled" [...] {{and that he would}} complain to the A.C.B. Rowan later claimed that Illingworth and Snow swore at him, which they denied. The bowler was loudly booed and [...] "when he returned to his fielding position at long-leg Snow was pelted with bottles, cans and eaten pies". Some of the crowd wanted to shake his hand, but then he was grabbed by a drunk [...] at Paddington Hill who was forced to let go by other spectators. In 1998 the eighty-year-old Trevor Guy told the Sydney Morning Herald that he was the man who had grabbed Snow in order to tell him what he thought about him hitting Jenner. Guy and Snow, in Australia for the 1998–99 Ashes series agreed that they had no hard feelings. To avoid injury to his team, Illingworth took his men back to the dressing room without the permission of the umpires, an unprecedented move in Test cricket. The England manager Clark tried to push Illingworth back onto the field and Alan Barnes of the A.C.B. demanded that they return immediately or they would forfeit the match and the Ashes. A furious Illingworth said he would not return until the playing area had been cleared and the crowd had calmed down. Furthermore, he strongly objected to Clark constantly siding with the Australians against his own team. It took seven minutes for the groundstaff to move the debris, during which one was hit on the head with a beer-can and had to be taken to hospital. Jenner returned to bat at 235–8 and made a brave 30, last man out on 264 to give Australia a lead of 80 runs. England made 302 in their second innings and set Australia 223 to win. Snow took a wicket in his first over, but smashed his finger on the wooden boundary fence trying to catch a six off Keith Stackpole. He was taken to hospital for an operation under general anaesthetic to reconstruct his shattered finger bones. England's spinners did the job, dismissing Australia for 160 to win by 62 runs and regain The Ashes while Snow was on the operating table. He recovered in time to join in [...] "the champagne-filled, beer-laden, hangover-inducing rejoicings of Sydney". Snow's 31 wickets (22.83) was the most by an England bowler in Australia since Harold Larwood's 33 wickets (19.51) in 1932–33. No England bowler after Snow has taken 25 wickets in a Test series in Australia.|$|E
2500|$|The England team {{thought that}} the Australian umpires failed to apply Law 46; 'the {{persistent}} bowling of fast short-pitched balls at the batsman is unfair if, {{in the opinion of}} the umpire at the bowler's end, it constitutes a systematic attempt at intimidation'. Wisden noted that [...] "never in the 98 years of Test cricket have batsmen been so grievously bruised and battered by ferocious, hostile, short-pitched balls". Both Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson had written and stated that they liked to bowl bouncers to intimidate batsmen, with Thomson's 'blood on the wicket' statement particularly offending old-fashioned sensibilities. Traditionally it was the job of the captain to restrain his bowlers if they became too aggressive, but Ian Chappell refused to do so and the Australian umpires were loath to give them official warnings. It is rare in Test cricket for an umpire to give a bowler an official warning or to ban him, and in Sydney the crowd would not have accepted such a move. To be fair the England fast bowlers John Snow and Bob Willis had bowled short and fast on the previous tour and Chappell [...] "employed almost the identical tactics used by Illingworth and Snow in 1970-71" [...] when the tourists had complained about Umpire Rowan's interference. Willis returned to bowl short in 1974-75, but was injury prone and not as fast as either Lillee or Thomson. It was possible for umpires to curb even a fast bowler like Lillee, as Dickie Bird was to demonstrate in England, but Brooks and Bailhache were relatively inexperienced and lacked authority. They also lacked the backing of the Australia Board of Control who enjoyed record profits from the series thanks to the crowd-drawing qualities of the bowlers. Keith Fletcher had his arm bruised by Thomson in the First Test and Dennis Amiss and John Edrich their hands bruised from being constantly hit with short balls. Wally Edwards was hit by a Willis bouncer in the Second Test, Colin Cowdrey on the arm by Lillee and David Lloyd painfully in the groin by Thomson. The Third Test had Fred Titmus struck a blow {{to the back of the}} knee from a ball by Thomson. In the Fourth Test Tony Greig hit Lillee on the elbow and Ashley Mallett on his bowling hand with his medium paced bouncers, John Edrich had his ribs broken when he <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> a Lillee bouncer that kept low and Fletcher was hit on the head. In the Sixth Test Greg Chappell was struck on the chin by Peter Lever. Edrich (twice), Amiss and Lloyd were all dropped from Tests due to the severity of their injuries.|$|E

2500|$|After rain {{delayed the}} start until 3 o'clock Ken Mackay won the toss and batted {{regardless}} of the convention that rain livens up the pitch at Brisbane, but Fred Trueman had backache and Brian Statham was being rested and the MCC bowling attack lacked bite. David Larter sent the ball flying over the batsmen's heads, but he scatter the ball all over the place. Len Coldwell dug the ball in as well and had a good slower ball, but failed {{to get the ball}} to swing. Peter Parfitt removed Des Ball with a diving catch at 10/1, {{but the rest of the}} day saw la number of missed chances and Queensland reached 123/2 by the end of the day. Sam Trimble crawled to 95 in six hours, a dismal innings which Johnny Moyes thought [...] "lacked so much in batsmanship that it did not deserve to go down in the records". Nevertheless, with Tom Veivers (36), Peter Burge (34) and Graham Bizzell (59) he took the score to 259/5. Even [...] "Slasher" [...] Mackay looked good after this and the dour Queenslander started driving the ball through the covers, adding 85 with Des Hughson (26) and 88 with wicket-keeper Wally Grout who hit a swashbuckling 56 with 2 sixes and 6 fours. Mackay made 105 not out, the first century for Queensland vs the MCC since 1950-51 and their 433/7 declared was their highest score against them since the war. Geoff Pullar had the flu and Colin Cowdrey was also resting, so Peter Parfitt opened with David Sheppard saw the tourists through to stumps then took their stand to 101 the next day. Queensland's overseas player was the West Indian fast bowler Wes Hall and earlier on the Monday one of his bouncers rose awkwardly and broke Grout's jaw, he was hurried to hospital and missed the First Test as a result. Hall (0/106) was overbowled on the now flat Woolloongabba wicket and Queensland's best bowler was the leg-spinner Colin Westaway (3/156), which pretty much sums up the innings as the MCC piled up 581/6. Peter Parfitt made a subdued 47 and David Sheppard was dropped on 51, 77 and 83 before Mackay bowled him for 94. Ted Dexter powered his way to 80 in 85 minutes with a 6 and 13 fours, adding 110 with Sheppard. The insatiable Ken Barrington amassed 183 not out with 22 boundaries, including some superb drives, pulls and cuts, adding 103 with Tom Graveney (52) and 180 with the all rounder Barry Knight, who hit 2 sixes and 11 fours in his 81. Alan Smith came in at 512/6, but when he reached 22 he <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> a Wes Hall bouncer that stayed low and became the second wicket-keeping casualty of the match. The Duke of Norfolk and the team physiotherapist Sam Cowan helped him off the field and took him to hospital, where to everyone's relief x-rays found that he had not fractured his skull. Dexter declared for 581/6 and John Murray came on as a substitute keeper. Queensland only had to bat out the afternoon, but Mackay re-arranged the batting order and they promptly collapsed to Dexter's medium-paced swing (4/8) and the part-time leg-spin of Tom Graveney (2/2). Mackay came in for the penultimate ball with the score on at 94/7 and was missed in the slips. With Grout unable to bat had Mackay been out the MCC would have needed to take Westaway's wicket with the last ball of the match for a surprise win in an otherwise dull game.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Lever (3/43) had Ken Eastwood caught {{behind by}} Alan Knott and John Snow (1/68) removed Keith Stackpole's off stump {{with a ball}} that came back a foot after {{pitching}} to leave Australian 13/2 {{at the end of}} the first day. Bob Willis (3/58) caught the nightwatchman Rod Marsh and bowled Ian Chappell the next morning and they were 66/4, but Ian Redpath (59) and Doug Walters (42) added 81. Walters was stumped on 41 by Knott, who made 6 dismissals in the match, but 'when Umpire Rowan ruled Walters not out, Knott stood on the edge of the popping crease as if paralysed with unbelief. Walters was stumped off Underwood (2/39) on 42 and given out by Umpire O'Connell and the spinner caught and bowled Ian Redpath. When Kerry O'Keeffe was out at 178/7 Greg Chappell (65) was left alone with the tail, but Terry Jenner retired hurt when he <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> a [...] on 8. Rowan warned the fast bowler for intimidatory bowling yet again, but Snow and Illingworth objected strongly, the captain saying [...] "That's the only bouncer he's bowled" [...] and that he would complain to the ABC, but Snow had bowled three other short balls at Jenner earlier in the over and Bob Willis had been brought in for the mis-hit. Rowan later claimed that Illingworth and Snow swore at him, which they denied. The bowler was loudly booed and [...] "when he returned to his fielding position at long-leg Snow was pelted with bottles, cans and partially eaten pies". Some of the crowd wanted to shake his hand, but then he was [...] at Paddington Hill who was forced to let go by other spectators. In 1998 the eighty-year-old Trevor Guy told the Sydney Morning Herald that he was the man who had grabbed Snow in order to tell him what he thought about him hitting Jenner.

To avoid injury to his team Illingworth took his men back to the dressing room without the permission of the umpires, an unprecedented move in Test cricket. He later justified his action by saying [...] "I've seen people hit by bottles and it makes a bloody mess of them". The England manager David Clark tried to push Illingworth back onto the field and Lou Rowan told them that if they did not immediately return they would forfeit the match (and the Ashes) and was supported by Alan Barnes of the ABC. A furious Illingworth said he would not return until the playing area had been cleared and the crowd had calmed down. Furthermore, he strongly objected to Clark constantly siding with the Australians against his own team. It took seven minutes for the groundstaff to move the debris, during which one was hit on the head with a beer-can and had to be taken to hospital, though most of the 40 cans were for soft drinks. The Australian batsmen Greg Chappell and Dennis Lillee remained at the crease throughout the incident.

Ponta hurled himself upon him with terrific force, delivering an uppercut and a straight punch. But Joe blocked the two, ducked a third, stepped to the side to avoid a fourth, and was then driven backward into a corner by a hurricane of blows. He was exceedingly weak. He tottered as he kept his footing, and staggered back and forth. His back was against the ropes. There was no further retreat. Ponta paused, {{as if to make}} doubly sure, then feinted with his left and struck fiercely with his right with all his strength.
