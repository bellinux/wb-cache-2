Thus, it occurs in many environmental compartments. For example, a 2008 report by the National Park Service found that <b>endosulfan</b> commonly contaminates air, water, plants, and fish of national parks in the US. Most of these parks are far from areas where <b>endosulfan</b> is used. <b>Endosulfan</b> {{has been found in}} remote locations such as the Arctic Ocean, {{as well as in the}} Antarctic atmosphere.

Elevated temperature (50 degrees C) combined with ultrasonication (35 kHz, 30 min) at 25 g L- 1 methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and 100 mL L- 1 sunflower oil were effective in extracting OCPs from the soil. After four successive washing cycles, the removal efficiency for total OCPs, DDTs, <b>endosulfans,</b> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -hexachlorocyclohexanes, heptachlors, and chlordanes were all about 99 %. The 4 th washed soil with 3 months cultivation of Portulaca oleracea L. and nutrient addition significantly increase (p < 0. 05) the number, biomass carbon, nitrogen, and functioning diversity of soil microorganisms. This implied that the microbiological functioning of the soil was at least partially restored. This combined cleanup strategy proved to be effective and environmental friendly. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This allows research provides insight into elevation gradient distributions and possible cold trapping effects of SVOCs in this high mountain area, and compares lichens and mosses as air passive samplers for indicating SVOC occurrences. DDTs, <b>endosulfans,</b> HCHs and hexachlorobenzene predominated in all of the samples. Source analysis indicted that there were fresh inputs of DDTs and HCHs in the sampling region. Lichens and mosses shared commonalities in revealing the profiles and levels of SVOCs based on their lipid-content-normalized concentrations. The concentrations of 12 OCPs and 14 PCBs in lichens were significantly linearly correlated with altitudes, whereas the correlations for mosses and soil with altitudes were insignificant.

40|$|Bulk {{atmospheric}} deposition {{samples were collected}} between 2004 and 2007 at four high-altitude European sites encompassing east (Skalnaté Pleso), west (Lochnagar), central (Gossenköllesee) and south (Redòn) regions, and analysed for legacy and current-use organochlorine compounds (OCs). Polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) generally showed the highest deposition fluxes in the four sites, between 112 and 488 ng m − 2 mo − 1, and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) the lowest, a few ng m − 2 mo − 1. Among pesticides, <b>endosulfans</b> were found at higher deposition fluxes (11 – 177 ng m − 2 mo − 1) than hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) (17 – 66 ng m − 2 mo − 1) in all sites except Lochnagar that was characterized by very low fluxes of this insecticide. Comparison of the present measurements with previous determinations in Redòn (1997 – 1998 and 2001 – 2002) and Gossenköllesee (1996 – 1998) provided {{for the first time}} an assessment of the long-term temporal trends in OC {{atmospheric deposition}} in the European background areas. PCBs showed increasing deposition trends while HCB deposition fluxes remained nearly constant. Re-emission of PCBs from soils or as a consequence of glacier melting and subsequent precipitation and trapping of the volatilized compounds may explain the observed PCB trends. This process does not occur for HCB due to its high volatility which keeps most of this pollutant in the gas phase. A significant decline of pesticide deposition was observed during this studied decade (1996 – 2006) which is consistent with the restriction in the use of these compounds in most of the European countries. In any case, degassing of HCHs or <b>endosulfans</b> from ice melting to the atmosphere should be limited because of the low Henry's law constants of these compounds that will retain them dissolved in the melted water. Investigation of the relationship between air mass trajectories arriving at each site and OC deposition fluxes showed no correlation for PCBs, which is consistent with diffuse pollution from unspecific sources as the predominant origin of these compounds in these remote sites. In contrast, significant correlations between current-use pesticides and air masses flowing from the south were observed in Gossenköllesee, Lochnagar and Redòn. In the case of Redòn, the higher proportion of air masses from the south occurred in parallel to higher temperatures, which did not allow us to discriminate between these two determinant factors of pesticide deposition. However, in Gossenköllesee and Lochnagar, the relationship between pesticide concentration and southern air masses was univocal, reflecting the impact of regions with intensive agricultural activities...|$|R

Soil samples were collected from ten college school yards in Beijing in 2006 and analyzed to determine fifteen OCPs. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) were found to be the main pollutants, accounting for 93. 70 % of total OCPs, followed by hexachlorohexanes (HCHs) (2. 25 %) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) (1. 82 %). Content of chlordanes (CHLs), heptachlors (HEPTs), and <b>endosulfans</b> comprised 0. 51 %, 1. 05 %, and 0. 79 % of fifteen OCPs, respectively. The preliminary pollution assessment indicated that DDTs have caused high OCPs levels in some schools. Source identification showed that HCHs in soils were originated from an old mixed source of technical HCHs and lindane. And DDTs were mainly from mixed use of technical DDTs and dicofol containing DDT impurities. According to GB 15618 - 1995 (guidelines of Chinese environmental quality standards for soils), HCHs and DDTs levels might be categorized as little and low polluting pesticides.

Concentrations and spatial and seasonal distribution of dichlorodiphenyltrichloro-ethanes (DDTs), chlordanes (CHLs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and <b>endosulfans</b> (Endo) are presented in this paper, and their potential sources are discussed based on the data-set.

DDT application for public health control and DDT activated antifouling paint for fishing ships may be the two most important current sources of technical DDT. The DDT concentrations in several Chinese cities seem to match well with the reported DDT concentrations in human breast milk. A low TC/CC ratio was observed across China in the winter to spring, which may provide a fingerprint of Chinese chlordane emission. It was suggested that "weathered" chlordane emitted from urban construction foundations in winter may give the distinctively low TC/CC ratio.

40|$|Xenobiotic estrogens are {{external}} compounds with estrogenic {{activity that}} may thereby affect {{the risk of}} breast cancer. This paper describes a mechanism by which xenoestrogens may affect the development of breast cancer. Estradiol metabolism proceeds by hydroxylation at one of two mutually exclusive sites at C- 2 and C- 1 6 a. The catechol pathway yields the weakly estrogenic 2 -hydroxyestrone (2 -OH El), which inhibits breast cell proliferation. In contrast, the alternative pathway yields the genotoxic 16 a-hydroxyestrone (16 cx-OHE 1), which enhances breast cell growth, increases unscheduled DNA synthesis, and oncogene and virus expression, and increases anchorage-independent growth. Using a radiometric assay that measures the relative formation of 16 a-OHE, versus 2 -OHE, from specifically tritiated estradiol in (ER+) MCF- 7 cells, we compared the ratio of 1 6 a-OHE 1 / 2 -OHEl observed after treatment with the known rodent carcinogen 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) with the ratios after treatment with DDT, atrazine, y-benzene hexachloride, kepone, coplanar PCBs, <b>endosulfans</b> and 11, linoleic and eicosapentenoic acids, and indole- 3 -carbinol (13 C). These pesticides significantly increase the ratio of 16 ct-OHE 1 / 2 -OHE, metabolites to values comparable to or greater than those observed after DMBA. In contrast, the antitumor agent 13 C increased 2 -OHE, formation and yielded ratios that are 1 / 3 of those found in unexposed control cells and 1 / 1 0 th of those found in DMBA-treated cells. Thus the ratio of 16 a-OHEl/ 2 -OHEl may provide a marker for {{the risk of breast}} cancer.

Total <b>endosulfans</b> were detected in 3 % of Sequoia samples, 9 % of Lassen samples and 24 % of Yosemite samples. Both pesticides were detected in tadpoles and metamorphs raised at the three parks regardless of origin. Because the tadpoles were translocated post hatching, this finding indicates that the pesticides, particularly DDE, were accumulated at the site, instead of through deposition in the egg mass. Liver cells from 108 newly metamorphosed frogs were examined with flow cytometry (FCM) techniques for evaluation of chromosome breakage {{as measured by the}} half-peak coefficient of variation (HPCV) of the G 1 peak. Regardless of origin, experimental groups raised at Lassen, the reference site, had significantly less chromosomal breakage (p= 0. 04) than metamorphs raised at the other two parks. This is the first documented evidence of DNA damage in juvenile frogs in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Cholinesterase (ChE) was measured in tadpoles collected at 28 days and in juvenile frogs collected upon metamorphosis. In 2001, ChE activity was significantly higher in animals raised at Lassen (reference site), than at the other two parks, indicating less exposure to cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides. This trend was not observed in 2002, although Sequoia ChE values were consistently lower than the other two parks. Temperatures were significantly different among the three parks for both years (p< 0. 0001) and lower temperatures may correlate with lower ChE levels.

40|$|Anubha Goel, Doctor of Philosophy, 2007 Upper Delmarva Peninsula (within the Chesapeake Bay watershed), {{where the}} land use is {{predominantly}} agricultural, {{may be a}} significant source of pesticides (contributors in the declining water quality and bio-diversity of associated wetlands of the Chesapeake Bay) to the region. Although the Peninsula is predicted to be receiving significant inputs of herbicides through atmospheric deposition, the extent of local or regional atmospheric transport and deposition of pesticides to this area is poorly understood. The goal of this research was to determine the atmospheric levels and estimate deposition flux of pesticides in the Upper Delmarva Peninsula. This was accomplished by collecting weekly air samples (n= 271) and event based rain samples (n= 489) from three locations in the region (Dover and Lewes, DE; Cambridge, MD) for the period 2000 - 2003. The samples were analyzed for the presence of 34 pesticides (19 current use (CUPs), 15 historical (HUPs)) and 4 congeners of penta-BDE (PBDEs) using gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Statistically analyzed data was used to evaluate factors impacting phase distribution and the contribution of wet deposition to the levels in Chesapeake Bay. The more persistent insecticides and fungicides occur ubiquitously while application on corn influences herbicide occurrence and levels. Atmospheric CUP levels are driven by regional agricultural activity. CUPs do not exist in equilibrium and local meteorological conditions (like high relative humidity) influence phase distribution. The wet deposition flux of insecticide and fungicide is dependent on the total rainfall amount during the sampling period while timing and frequency relative to application on corn impacts herbicide flux. Levels in rainwater of some pesticides (<b>endosulfans,</b> chlorothalonil, diazinon etc.) were high enough to be of concern for the biota associated with the region's water bodies and associated wetlands and reveals that atmospheric deposition arising out of short range atmospheric transport can result in significant pesticide input to non-target areas.

Researchers studying children from many villages in Kasargod District, Kerala, India, have linked <b>endosulfan</b> exposure to delays in sexual maturity among boys. <b>Endosulfan</b> {{was the only}} pesticide applied to cashew plantations in the villages for 20 years, and had contaminated the village environment. The researchers compared the villagers to a control group of boys from a demographically similar village that lacked a history of <b>endosulfan</b> pollution. Relative to the control group, the exposed boys had high levels of <b>endosulfan</b> in their bodies, lower levels of testosterone, and delays in reaching sexual maturity. Birth defects of the male reproductive system, including cryptorchidism, were also more prevalent in the study group. The researchers concluded, [...] "our study results suggest that <b>endosulfan</b> exposure in male children may delay sexual maturity and interfere with sex hormone synthesis." [...] Increased incidences of cryptorchidism have been observed in other studies of <b>endosulfan</b> exposed populations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{compound}} {{breaks down}} into <b>endosulfan</b> sulfate, <b>endosulfan</b> diol, and <b>endosulfan</b> furan, {{all of which}} have structures similar to the parent compound and, according to the EPA, [...] "are also of toxicological concern…The estimated half-lives for the combined toxic residues (<b>endosulfan</b> plus <b>endosulfan</b> sulfate) [...] from roughly 9 months to 6 years." [...] The EPA concluded, [...] "ased on environmental fate laboratory studies, terrestrial field dissipation studies, available models, monitoring studies, and published literature, it can be concluded that <b>endosulfan</b> is a very persistent chemical which may stay in the environment for lengthy periods of time, particularly in acid media." [...] The EPA also concluded, [...] "ndosulfan has relatively high potential to bioaccumulate in fish." [...] It is also toxic to amphibians; low levels have been found to kill tadpoles.|$|E
