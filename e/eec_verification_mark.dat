40|$|Abstract—With more {{integration}} in VLSI technology, Intellectual Property (IP) cores are reused {{to meet the}} customer’s specifications in time. For intellectual property protection (IPP), various kinds of IP marks, such as watermarks, fingerprints, are embedded into the design for establishing the veracity of a legal IP owner. However, convincing public <b>verification</b> of such <b>marks</b> is not leakageproof. Attackers not only manage to obtain potential clues to tamper public <b>marks</b> rendering public <b>verification</b> invalid, but can also suitably override the marks to include own signature, resulting in wrong public identification of IP vendor and IP buyer. Furthermore, current technique includes a sufficiently large set of public marks containing a header and a message body in addition to private ones to facilitate only public verification {{at the cost of}} significant increase in design overhead. We propose a zero-knowledge protocol to ensure robust and leakage proof convincing public verification with a smaller set of public marks consisting of only header part. We have tested our protocol for FPGA benchmarks and the results on robustness and overhead are encouraging.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{researchers}} have proposed using digital marks to provide ownership (watermarking) and recipient (fingerprinting) identification for intellectual property. Many of these techniques share three specific weaknesses: complexity of copy detection, vulnerability to mark removal after revelation for ownership <b>verification,</b> and <b>mark</b> integrity issues due to partial mark removal. This paper presents a method for watermarking and fingerprinting {{field programmable gate array}} (FPGA) intellectual property (IP) that achieves robustness by responding to these three weaknesses.

30|$|<b>Marker</b> <b>verification</b> A {{group of}} markers are {{verified}} {{together for a}} control transfer instruction. Since they have complete information for the control transfer, the same verification process can be performed {{regardless of whether they}} come from fragments or a whole code. Thus, we can use the code watchdogs, which monitor the wireless network to detect attacks from binary code fragments. The recipient devices also have a whole updated program binary code. The program binary code with semantics markers can be repeatedly checked in the software attestation process. To prevent the attacker from illegally generating semantics markers, the marker is protected by a key. We assume the key is shared with the payload generator, code watchdogs, and the recipient devices.|$|R

40|$|A logical control {{extension}} surrounding cashless {{means of exchange}} is a permanent personal <b>verification</b> <b>mark.</b> An implanted micro chip such as ones that have been successfully implanted into humans could identify and store information. Connected with global positioning satellites and a computer system, a cashless monetary system could be formed in the future. The system would provide complete and continual real time records for individuals, businesses and regulators. It would be possible for all trading to occur in this way in the future. A modified Technology Acceptance Model was developed based on Davis&# 039; (1989) model and Fishbein and Ajzen&# 039;s (1975) theory to test the acceptance level of the new monetary system by professional accountants in Australia. The model includes perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived risk, and a subjective norm component. 523 accountants were surveyed in December 2003 with {{a response rate of}} 27 %. 13 % either strongly agreed or agreed that they would accept the implantable chip. The analysis showed that Perception of Risk, Subjective Norm and Perception of Usefulness were all significant in explaining the dependent variable at the 95 % confidence level. The Perception of Ease of Use was not proved to be significant. In consideration of response bias, it was found that with respect to the perception of usefulness at the 0. 01 level, two elements were not significant, those being "not having cards" and "having medical information". The difference here was not seen as fundamental for the credibility of the research given the main theme of the research is a monetary system based on the "mark" rather than the convenience factors of the two elements where there were differences. The perceived risk variable was not significant for early responders. The responses were also used to analyse the Technology Acceptance Model developed by Davis (1989). The m odel had a significance of 0. 327 compared to 0. 000 giving validation to the contributions of the modified Technology Acceptance Model. Davis&# 039; (1989) model found Perception of Ease of Use was significant at the 95 % confidence level and Perception of Usefulness was not proven to be significant. In further analyzing the developed model, each of the elements in the model used as independent variables were separately regressed against contributions established in open questions relating to them. Subjective norm had a regression R-squared of 0. 403 and of the thirty-four explanatory variables the only significant contribution, at the 95 % confidence level was "clients". Significant at the 10 % level, were religion, public figures and friends. The professional bodies variable was not significant in determining the subjective norm. Perceived Ease of Use and the nine explanatory variables had an R-squared of 0. 143. There were only two significant contributions for ease of use, at the 95 % confidence level being "privacy" and "technology". Perceived Usefulness and the eleven explanatory variables had an R-squared of 0. 205.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a semi-blind video {{watermarking}} scheme for the <b>verification</b> problem, where <b>mark</b> embedding {{is carried out}} by designing a complexity-adaptive watermark signal via solving a constrained optimization problem. By adding the resulting watermark to the unmarked host, we effectively quantize pseudorandom linear statistics of the host in the wavelet domain using a secret codebook. We introduce a stochastic video model and exploit it during the design. In particular, we use the proposed model to generate a “complexity map”, which is then employed in solving the underlying optimization problem to “regularize ” the watermark. Consequently, the resulting watermark is locally adapted to the statistical complexity of the signal at a coefficient level. Regularization is achieved by solving the underlying optimization problem using an iterative algorithm. We experimentally validate the complexity-adaptive structure of the resulting scheme, while maintaining robustness against numerous attacks, such as low bit rate video compression, mild geometric modifications, etc. This paper {{can be viewed as}} a continuation of our previous work [1]. 1...|$|R

Different methods were applied for fractographic reconstitution of fatigue crack growth: (a) measurement of striation spacing, (b) identification of beach marks, (c) image textural analysis of SEM images of fatigue fracture surfaces (textural fractography) aimed at morphological features oriented in the direction of crack growth.

Prior to the release of the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) report To Err Is Human, there was no process for recognizing, reporting and tracking injuries and near misses in the surgical setting. 3 As such, surgeons were largely unaware of the widespread nature of this issue. 3 Following the release of the IOM report, a 2003 Joint Commission summit brought together a multi-disciplinary team of health care professionals to examine and address the scope of WSS. 3, 5 Their work {{led to the creation of}} a protocol, The Universal Protocol for Preventing Wrong Site, Wrong Procedure, and Wrong Person Surgery. 3, 5 Rooted in prevention theories derived in high-risk industries like aviation and nuclear weaponry, the Universal Protocol outlines three key elements for systems change to prevent WSS. 3 1.
