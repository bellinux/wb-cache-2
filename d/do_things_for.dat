Similar findings are also reported by Kinsey (cited by Masters), and others earlier in history. Miletski (1999) notes that information on sex with animals on the internet is often very emphatic as to what the zoophile believes gives pleasure and how to identify what is perceived as consent beforehand. For instance, Jonathan Balcombe says animals <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> pleasure. But he himself says pet owners will be unimpressed by this statement, as this is not news to them.|$|E

The initial concept was to make an action role-playing game and Levine was given the job of designing the game's world and story. Levine said the initial ideas and projects that have later morphed into Dark Camelot, before eventually evolving into The Dark Project, included School of Wizards, Dark Elves Must Die and Better Red Than Undead, the latter of which was [...] "a campy story" [...] about communist zombies. The game {{was supposed to be}} a first-person sword fighting simulator, but [...] "the marketing [...] killed the idea," [...] to his disappointment. According to programmer Marc LeBlanc, [...] "The first proposal was Better Red Than Undead, a '50s Cold War game where the Soviet Union is overrun with zombies and you have to go hack them to pieces as the loner from the CIA because bullets don't work on the undead." [...] Doug Church said the game's design was built around the idea [...] "of having factions who you could ally with or oppose yourself with or <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> or not." ...|$|E

2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of books (including both of Guralnick's books) on Presley contain details of his many romances and alleged affairs including many while {{he was married to}} Priscilla. It has also been reported that Presley [...] "adored to fondle and suck women's toes, and those in his entourage who were given the job of choosing companions for him would often be asked to check the girls' feet." [...] However, according to Alan Fortas, an all-Memphis football halfback who became a bodyguard and part of the Presley entourage, [...] "Elvis needed someone to baby more than he needed a sex partner. He craved the attention of someone who adored him without the threat of sexual pressure, much as a mother would." [...] Furthermore, [...] "Elvis befriended some of the young girls who used to cluster adoringly in his driveway, or outside the fence ... Some of the girls were as young as fourteen. Fortas said they were frequent houseguests who attended his concerts as part of 'Elvis's personal traveling show.' Out in the backyard, they romped with Elvis in the Doughboy pool and challenged him to watermelon-seed spitting contests. They also slipped into his bedroom ... for rambunctious pillow fights. Sometimes they would all sit cross-legged with him on the bed, flipping through his fan magazines or admiring his stuffed-animal collection. Often they would all lie down together and cuddle. But what went on was horseplay, not foreplay."
