5|$|It is a {{particularly}} poignant melody that should play with an audience's emotions. The mistress clearly <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing sleeping with an older man, {{and yet there is}} something expletive about it as well. Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section is so well structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. This allows the audience to invest in a single moment while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move forward in the story.|$|E
5|$|Experts {{testified in}} court {{she also said}} she conversed with Lord Voldemort {{and one of the}} Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. On August 1, 2014, she was found incompetent to stand trial and her {{prosecution}} was suspended until her condition improved. On November 12, 2014, a doctor judged that her condition had improved enough for her to stand trial, and on December 19, 2014, the judge ruled that both girls were competent to stand trial. In August 2015, the presiding judge ruled that the girls would be tried as adults. They were tried separately. On August 21, 2017, one of the girls, now 15, pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide, but claimed she was not responsible for her actions on grounds of insanity. Although prosecutors alleged that she <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing was wrong, the jury determined that she was mentally ill during the attack. She will spend at least three years in a mental hospital.|$|E
500|$|After she {{graduated}} from high school, Sanders left her foster parents' home in Detroit to study at the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), a historically black college in Alabama that was Lorenzo Malloy's alma mater. She intended to earn a degree in education and become a teacher. When she left Detroit to go to Alabama, her foster mother stood {{at the train station}} crying. Shabazz later recalled that Malloy was trying to mumble something, but the words would not come out. By the time she arrived in Alabama, she felt she knew what her foster mother was saying. [...] "The minute I got off that train, I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> trying to say. She was trying to tell me in ten words or less about racism." ...|$|E

2500|$|A public {{memorial}} service, {{attended by}} about 1,500 people, {{was held at}} Nashville's historic Ryman Auditorium on April 9, 1998. A private, grave-side service had been held earlier with a crypt entombment at Nashville's Woodlawn Memorial Park Cemetery. Her death solicited commentary {{such as that of}} songwriter Bill Mack, quoted in the Dallas Morning News that she was a [...] "class act" [...] and [...] "irreplaceable" [...] and that [...] "She never knew a flat note." [...] Lee Ann Womack was quoted also; she said of Wynette, whose songs often evoked strength and controlled passion, [...] "You knew she <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> singing about. You can put her records on and listen and learn so much." [...] Wynette was survived by her husband George Richey, four daughters and eight grandchildren.|$|E
2500|$|Wuornos was incarcerated at the Florida Department of Corrections Broward Correctional Institution (BCI) {{death row}} for women, then {{transferred}} to the Florida State Prison for execution. Her appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied in 1996. In a 2001 petition to the Florida Supreme Court, she stated her intention to dismiss her legal counsel and terminate all pending appeals. [...] "I killed those men," [...] she wrote, [...] "robbed them as cold as ice. And I'd do it again, too. There's no chance in keeping me alive or anything, because I'd kill again. I have hate crawling through my system...I am so sick of hearing this 'she's crazy' stuff. I've been evaluated so many times. I'm competent, sane, and I'm trying to tell the truth. I'm one who seriously hates human life and would kill again." [...] While her attorneys argued {{that she was not}} mentally competent to make such a request, Wuornos insisted that she <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing, and a court-appointed panel of psychiatrists agreed.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{it was not}} planned, Zsa Zsa {{was given}} a {{personality}} {{similar to that of}} her on-screen aunt, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), an established character in EastEnders. During the development of the character, she changed a lot and was fluid until filming started, when Kenny had a full day on set with Henry. She explained: [...] "The words were there and I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> like but when I saw Linda [...] speak and when I engaged with her, I realised that it was like looking in a mirror." [...] When the character was announced, she was described as beautiful, funky, an outspoken tomboy, very bright, but likes to think she does not need anybody's help. Kenny said of the character in an interview with Soaplife magazine: [...] "Zsa Zsa doesn't like authority or anyone who messes with her. She's a lone wolf and doesn't care about anyone." [...] She told entertainment website Digital Spy that Zsa Zsa is [...] "a real bitch" [...] and [...] "very mean and cold", while a profile for the character on the official EastEnders website says she is sarcastic, a rebel and [...] "desperately wants the security that comes with a family but is terrified of being dependent on anyone. Her experience has taught her that adults let you down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{that was}} like her!' cried Stephen triumphantly. 'She {{was in such a}} flurry that <b>she</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You're right, Martin," [...] Olney said. [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you're after, and Ruth doesn't. <b>She</b> doesn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> after {{for herself}} even." ...|$|R
60|$|She felt {{from his}} eyes that he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{suffering}}, and was even suffering with her.|$|E
60|$|Before Lemuel <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing, {{she flew}} out of the door, and {{he could hear her}} flying down the stairs.|$|E

60|$|When the Princess {{saw that}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{delivered}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> so delighted that <b>she</b> did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing, and skipped and danced.|$|R
6000|$|... "You say {{anything}} to your mother if you dare," [...] said the now maddened skipper. [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is.</b> It’s all the mate’s nonsense." ...|$|R
60|$|The captain grunted again, and, in a {{voice that}} he vainly endeavoured to render polite, said that he did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> talking about.|$|R
6000|$|... "She was furious, of course. She did {{not refer}} to the matter when we were alone together, {{but there was no}} need to. I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> thinking." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{might have}} been a Countess! she knew she might, but for this cursed barrier between her and her fortune. Wood <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{thinking}} of, and smiled grimly.|$|E
6000|$|She {{took the}} great hand which she held between hers, {{and before he}} <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing and could prevent her, raised it to her lips and kissed it, saying lovingly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{difference}} does that make?" [...] Janet retorted. [...] "And you can't tell me <b>she</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{up to all}} along--with that face." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They're being {{took care}} of," [...] replied his wife, with spirit. [...] "Aunt Emma's minding 'em for you--and you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is.</b> H'sh! Alf! Alf! I'm {{surprised}} at you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{was a mere}} child, poor dear,' {{said her}} mother; 'only eighteen! Yet Amy was but a year older last summer. How unlike! <b>She</b> must have <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cousin Sarah, {{the other}} evening," [...] she said, [...] "asked you to please leave us. I think she hardly <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> saying, and I {{hope you have}} not taken offense." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ozma {{ordered the}} boy's arrest," [...] said Dorothy, [...] "and {{of course she}} <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing. But if you can prove Ojo is {{innocent}} they will set him free at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I didn't think so," [...] Mr. Vane continued, [...] "I'd send 'em back. I never <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{until she}} {{picked me up}} and drove me down here. I've always done Victoria an injustice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{mother is}} not in a state to think one way or the other, Ned; <b>she</b> <b>is</b> in such a state of grief that <b>she</b> hardly <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> saying or doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She does like it--she told Gordon so," [...] said Bernard. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> up to! Gordon {{has taken}} leave of his wits; {{he wishes to}} put away his wife." ...|$|R
60|$|Harding felt {{disturbed}} but determined. He was keenly {{anxious to}} please the girl, but to yield in this matter would be to act against his principles. <b>She</b> did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> asking.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not prudent, certainly, aunt," [...] Ellen replied, with {{a vacancy}} in her air, that proved how little she <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> saying; [...] "and it is setting {{a very bad}} example to his sons." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{voice of}} Monsieur Harmost, softly gruff, {{as if he}} <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> feeling, {{increased}} her emotion; her breast heaved under the humming-bird blouse, water came into her eyes, and more than ever her lips quivered. He was saying: ...|$|E
6000|$|Nobody {{will call}} this [...] "the {{touch of a}} {{vanished}} hand". Part of Mrs. Elliot's mind <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> about, and started an unreal but veracious feeling to warn her. We shall come to plenty of Hands not so readily disposed of.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know. Let me see," [...] said Ermentrude, rising; but at {{the window}} her pale blue eyes gazed vacantly as if <b>she</b> did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> looking at or for.|$|R
6000|$|... "Guess she is," [...] said Mrs. Moses. [...] "That gal {{is worth}} any seven grown-up women in town. And <b>she</b> <b>was</b> four nights settin' {{in my kitchen}} before I <b>knowed</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> up to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, I am sure. I can't follow her. I don't {{understand}} her. She {{has something}} in her head; I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> trying to do. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> too deep for me." ...|$|R
