Bricks for steps and a fireplace were hand-made, probably from local clay. The core initially comprised a central hallway and 4 rooms - front parlour, front bedroom, rear dining room and rear bedroom. The latter was partitioned into two bedrooms at a some stage - some Burnett descendants believe it was always partitioned. A short time later two attic bedrooms were added. Early photographs of the house show external walls of deep boards and exposed timber stud framing, encircled by verandahs and resting on low stumps. The high-pitched shingled roof had a short ridge, and the verandah roofs, also shingled, were supported on plain chamfered timber posts. Glass and timber-panelled French doors opened onto the verandahs from all rooms. The first front steps were of timber, but had been replaced by 1907 with masonry steps. Between early 1907 and mid-1909, the verandah roofs were replaced with corrugated galvanised iron; later the whole roof was clad with iron. An external oven and chimney is shown in the earliest photograph, dated , but later a detached kitchen wing was built.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The LiteSteel Beam (LSB) {{is a new}} cold-formed steel hollow flange channel beam {{recently}} developed in Australia.

40|$|SupaCee {{section is}} one of the cold-formed steel members which is {{increasingly}} used in the construction sector. It is characterized by unique ribbed web and curved lip elements, and is claimed to be more economical with extra strength than the traditional channel sections. SupaCee sections are widely used in Australia as <b>floor</b> joists, <b>bearers,</b> purlins and girts. Many experimental and numerical studies have been carried out to evaluate the behaviour and design of conventional channel beams subject to web crippling. To date, however, no investigation has been conducted into the web crippling behaviour and strength of SupaCee sections. Current cold-formed steel design equations do not include any design procedures for SupaCee sections. Hence experimental studies were conducted to assess the web crippling behaviour and strengths of SupaCee sections under ETF and ITF load cases. Thirty six web crippling tests were conducted and the capacity results were compared with the predictions from the AS/NZS 4600 and AISI design rules developed for conventional channel sections. Comparison of ultimate web crippling capacities from tests showed that AS/NZS 4600 and AISI design equations are unconservative for SupaCee sections under ETF load case, but are overly conservative for ITF load case. Hence new equations were proposed to determine the web crippling capacities of SupaCee sections based on the experimental results from this study. Suitable design rules were also developed within the direct strength method format.

In many instances, the predictions by the available design standards such as AISI S 100, AS/NZS 4600 and Eurocode 3 Part 1 - 3 [7 - 9] are inconsistent. Hence thirty-six tests were conducted to assess the web crippling behaviour and strengths of LCBs under two flange load cases. Experimental web crippling capacities were then compared with the predictions from the current design rules.

With increasing usage of cold-formed steel beams their fire safety design has become an important issue. Fire design rules are commonly based on past research on hot-rolled steel beams. Hence a detailed parametric study was undertaken using validated finite element models to investigate the lateral-torsional buckling behaviour of simply supported cold-formed steel lipped channel beams subjected to uniform bending at uniform elevated temperatures.

Therefore a detailed experimental study was conducted to study the web crippling under End Two-Flange (ETF) and Interior Two-Flange (ITF) load cases based on the new AISI S 909 standard web crippling test method [1]. Finite element models were developed and validated using the test results. These models were then used in a detailed parametric study to investigate the web crippling capacities of a wide range of LCB sections including different sectional geometric parameters such as section depth, inside bent radius, thickness and bearing length. This paper presents the details of the numerical study of LCBs subject to web crippling under ETF and ITF load cases. Using the extensive web crippling capacity data obtained from both numerical and experimental studies, improved unified web crippling design equations were developed. Suitable web crippling design rules were also developed under the direct strength method format...|$|R
40|$|LiteSteel beam (LSB) is {{a hollow}} flange channel made from cold-formed steel using a {{patented}} manufacturing process involving simultaneous cold-forming and dual electric resistance welding. LSBs are currently used as <b>floor</b> joists and <b>bearers</b> in buildings. However, {{there are no}} appropriate design standards available due to its unique hollow flange geometry, residual stress characteristics and initial geometric imperfections arising from manufacturing processes. Recent research {{studies have focused on}} investigating the structural behaviour of LSBs under pure bending, predominant shear and combined actions. However, web crippling behaviour and strengths of LSBs still need to be examined. Therefore, an experimental study was undertaken to investigate the web crippling behaviour and strengths of LSBs under EOF (End One Flange) and IOF (Interior One Flange) load cases. A total of 23 web crippling tests were performed and the results were compared with the current AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S 100 design standards, which showed that the cold-formed steel design rules predicted the web crippling capacity of LSB sections very conservatively under EOF and IOF load cases. Therefore, suitably improved design equations were proposed to determine the web crippling capacity of LSBs based on experimental results. In addition, new design equations were also developed under the Direct Strength Method format.

The LSBs were commonly used as <b>floor</b> joists and <b>bearers</b> with web openings in residential, industrial and commercial buildings. Due to the unique geometry of LSBs, {{as well as its}} unique residual stress characteristics and initial geometric imperfections resultant of manufacturing processes, much of the existing research for common cold-formed steel sections is not directly applicable to LSBs. Many research studies have been carried out to evaluate the behaviour and design of LSBs subject to pure bending actions, predominant shear and combined actions. However, to date, no investigation has been conducted into the web crippling behaviour and strength of LSB sections. Hence detailed experimental studies were conducted to investigate the web crippling behaviour and strengths of LSBs under EOF (End One Flange) and IOF (Interior One Flange) load cases. A total of 26 web crippling tests was conducted and the results were compared with current AS/NZS 4600 design rules. This comparison showed that AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005) design rules are very conservative for LSB sections under EOF and IOF load cases. Suitable design equations have been proposed to determine the web crippling capacity of LSBs based on experimental results.

40|$|LiteSteel Beam (LSB) {{is a new}} cold-formed {{steel beam}} {{produced}} by OneSteel Australian Tube Mills. The new beam is effectively a channel section with two rectangular hollow flanges and a slender web, and is manufactured using a combined cold-forming and electric resistance welding process. OneSteel Australian Tube Mills is promoting the use of LSBs as flexural members {{in a range of}} applications, such as <b>floor</b> <b>bearers.</b> When LSBs are used as back to back built-up sections, they are likely to improve their moment capacity and thus extend their applications further. However, the structural behaviour of built-up beams is not well understood. Many steel design codes include guidelines for connecting two channels to form a built-up I-section including the required longitudinal spacing of connections. But these rules were found to be inadequate in some applications. Currently the safe spans of builtup beams are determined based on twice the moment capacity of a single section. Research has shown that these guidelines are conservative. Therefore large scale lateral buckling tests and advanced numerical analyses were undertaken to investigate the flexural behaviour of back to back LSBs connected by fasteners (bolts) at various longitudinal spacings under uniform moment conditions. In this research an experimental investigation was first undertaken to study the flexural behaviour of back to back LSBs including its buckling characteristics. This experimental study included tensile coupon tests, initial geometric imperfection measurements and lateral buckling tests. The initial geometric imperfection measurements taken on several back to back LSB specimens showed that the back to back bolting process is not likely to alter the imperfections, and the measured imperfections are well below the fabrication tolerance limits. Twelve large scale lateral buckling tests were conducted to investigate the behaviour of back to back built-up LSBs with various longitudinal fastener spacings under uniform moment conditions. Tests also included two single LSB specimens. Test results showed that the back to back LSBs gave higher moment capacities in comparison with single LSBs, and the fastener spacing influenced the ultimate moment capacities. As the fastener spacing was reduced the ultimate moment capacities of back to back LSBs increased. Finite element models of back to back LSBs with varying fastener spacings were then developed to conduct a detailed parametric study on the flexural behaviour of back to back built-up LSBs. Two finite element models were developed, namely experimental and ideal finite element models. The models included the complex contact behaviour between LSB web elements and intermittently fastened bolted connections along the web elements. They were validated by comparing their results with experimental results and numerical results obtained from an established buckling analysis program called THIN-WALL. These comparisons showed that the developed models could accurately predict both the elastic lateral distortional buckling moments and the non-linear ultimate moment capacities of back to back LSBs. Therefore the ideal finite element models incorporating ideal simply supported boundary conditions and uniform moment conditions were used in a detailed parametric study on the flexural behaviour of back to back LSB members. In the detailed parametric study, both elastic buckling and nonlinear analyses of back to back LSBs were conducted for 13 LSB sections with varying spans and fastener spacings. Finite element analysis results confirmed that the current design rules in AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005) are very conservative while the new design rules developed by Anapayan and Mahendran (2009 a) for single LSB members were also found to be conservative. Thus new member capacity design rules were developed for back to back LSB members as a function of non-dimensional member slenderness. New empirical equations were also developed to aid in the calculation of elastic lateral distortional buckling moments of intermittently fastened back to back LSBs. Design guidelines were developed for the maximum fastener spacing of back to back LSBs in order to optimise the use of fasteners. A closer fastener spacing of span/ 6 was recommended for intermediate spans and some long spans where the influence of fastener spacing was found to be high. In the last phase of this research, a detailed investigation was conducted to investigate the potential use of different types of connections and stiffeners in improving the flexural strength of back to back LSB members. It was found that using transverse web stiffeners was the most cost-effective and simple strengthening method. It is recommended that web stiffeners are used at the supports and every third points within the span, and their thickness is in the range of 3 to 5 mm {{depending on the size of}} LSB section. The use of web stiffeners eliminated most of the lateral distortional buckling effects and hence improved the ultimate moment capacities. A suitable design equation was developed to calculate the elastic lateral buckling moments of back to back LSBs with the above recommended web stiffener configuration while the same design rules developed for unstiffened back to back LSBs were recommended to calculate the ultimate moment capacities...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the details of}} experimental studies on the shear strength of a recently developed, cold-formed steel beam known as LiteSteel Beam (LSB) with web openings. The innovative LSB sections have the beneficial characteristics of torsionally rigid closed rectangular flanges combined with economical fabrication processes from a single strip of high strength steel. They combine the stability of hot-rolled steel sections with the high strength to weight ratio of conventional cold-formed steel sections. The LSB sections are commonly used as flexural members in the building industry. Current practice in flooring systems is to include openings in the web element of <b>floor</b> joists or <b>bearers</b> so that building services can be located within them. Shear behaviour of LSBs with web openings is more complicated while their shear strengths are considerably reduced {{by the presence of}} web openings. However, limited research has been undertaken on the shear behaviour and strength of LSBs with web openings. Therefore a detailed experimental study involving 26 shear tests was undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour and strength of different LSB sections. Simply supported test specimens of LSBs with an aspect ratio of 1. 5 were loaded at midspan until failure. This paper {{presents the}} details of this experimental study and the results. Experimental results showed that the current design rules in cold-formed steel structures design codes (AS/NZS 4600) [1] are very conservative for the shear design of LSBs with web openings. Improved design equations have been proposed for the shear strength of LSBs with web openings based on experimental results from this study...|$|R
40|$|Lipped channel beams (LCBs) are {{commonly}} used as flexural members such as <b>floor</b> joists and <b>bearers</b> in the construction 6 industry. These thin-walled LCBs are subjected to specific buckling and failure modes, one of them being web crippling. Despite considerable 7 research in this area, some {{recent studies have shown}} that the current web crippling design rules are unable to predict the test capacities under 8 end-two-flange (ETF) and interior-two-flange (ITF) load conditions. In many instances, web crippling predictions by the available design 9 standards such as AISI S 100, AS/NZS 4600 and Eurocode 3 Part 1 - 3 are inconsistent, i. e., unconservative in some cases, although they 10 are conservative in other cases. Hence, experimental studies consisting of 36 tests were conducted in this research to assess the web crippling 11 behavior and capacities of high-strength LCBs under two-flange load cases (ETF and ITF). Experimental results were then compared with the 12 predictions from current design rules. Comparison of the ultimate web crippling capacities from tests showed that the design equations are 13 very unconservative for LCB sections under the ETF load case and are conservative for the ITF load case. Hence, improved equations were 14 proposed to determine the web crippling capacities of LCBs based on the experimental results from this study. Current design equations do 15 not provide the direct strength method (DSM) provisions for web crippling. Hence, suitable design rules were also developed under the DSM 16 format using the test results and buckling analyses using finite-element analyses...|$|R
40|$|This LiteSteel beam (LSB) {{is a new}} cold-formed steel hollow flange {{channel section}} {{produced}} using a patented manufacturing process involving simultaneous cold-forming and dual electric resistance welding. The LSBs are commonly used as <b>floor</b> joists and <b>bearers</b> with web openings in buildings. Their shear strengths are considerably reduced when web openings are included {{for the purpose of}} locating building services. Shear tests of LSBs with web openings have shown that there is up to 60 % reduction in the shear capacity. Hence {{there is a need to}} improve the shear capacity of LSBs with web openings. A cost effective way to eliminate the shear capacity reduction is to stiffen the web openings using suitable stiffeners. Hence numerical studies were undertaken to investigate the shear capacity of LSBs with stiffened web openings. In this research, finite element models of LSBs with stiffened web openings in shear were developed to simulate the shear behaviour and strength of LSBs. Various stiffening methods using plate and LSB stiffeners attached to LSBs using both welding and screw-fastening were attempted. The developed models were then validated by comparing their results with experimental results and used in further studies. Both finite element and experimental results showed that the stiffening arrangements recommended by past research for cold-formed steel channel beams are not adequate to restore the shear strengths of LSBs with web openings. Therefore new stiffener arrangements were proposed for LSBs with web openings. This paper presents the details of this research project using numerical studies and the results...|$|R
