5|$|In February 1974, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{more comprehensive}} health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage. In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes—both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing. In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for health <b>insurance</b> <b>reform,</b> Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through premiums to private health insurance companies—but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise plan.|$|E

25|$|There was {{a renewed}} push for health <b>insurance</b> <b>reform</b> in 1974. In January, representatives Martha Griffiths and James C. Corman {{introduced}} the Health Security Act, a universal {{national health insurance}} program providing comprehensive benefits without any cost sharing backed by the AFL-CIO and UAW. The following month Nixon again proposed the Comprehensive Health Insurance Actan employer mandate to offer private health insurance if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage. In April, Kennedy and Mills introduced the National Health Insurance Act, a bill to provide near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes and with lower cost sharing. Both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizens organizations, and neither gained traction. That summer, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for health <b>insurance</b> <b>reform,</b> Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan, but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise.|$|E
25|$|After campaigning on {{the promise}} of health care reform, President Barack Obama gave a speech in March 2010 at a rally in Pennsylvania {{explaining}} the necessity of health <b>insurance</b> <b>reform</b> and calling on Congress to hold a final up or down vote on reform. The result of his efforts was the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Because Obama's party did not have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, the law was amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 using the reconciliation process in which debate in the Senate is limited and the filibuster is therefore not permitted.|$|E
25|$|Nelson {{voted in}} favor of the Biggert–Waters Flood <b>Insurance</b> <b>Reform</b> Act of 2012, which {{required}} the National Flood Insurance Program to raise insurance rates for some properties at high risk of flooding. In 2014, following an outcry by Florida property owners facing steep flood insurance rate hikes, Nelson supported legislation to provide retroactive refunds for people who have had large flood insurance rate increases due to the sale or purchase of a home, cap average annual premium increases at 15 to 18 percent and allow subsidies for insurance rates that are based on current flood maps.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>insurance</b> <b>reforms,</b> the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Pub.L. 111-148, contains provisions related {{to health care}} workforce, long term care, slowing cost growth, prevention and wellness.

For example, there are many grants opportunities for workforce development and community health promotion.|$|R
40|$|Small {{firms that}} offer health {{insurance}} to their employees may face variable premiums if the firm hires an employee with high-expected health costs. To avoid expensive premium variability, a small firm may attempt to maintain a workforce with low-expected health costs. In addition, workers with high-expected health costs may prefer employment in larger firms with health insurance rather than in smaller firms. This results in employment distortions. We examine the magnitude of these employment distortions in hiring, employment, and separations, using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from 1996 to 2001. Furthermore, we {{examine the effect of}} state small group health <b>insurance</b> <b>reforms</b> that restrict insurers’ ability to deny coverage and restrict premium variability on employment distortions in small firms relative to large firms. We find that workers with high-expected health cost {{are less likely to be}} new hires in small firms that offer health insurance, and are less likely to be employed in insured small firms. However, we find no evidence that state small group health <b>insurance</b> <b>reforms</b> have reduced the extent of these distortions. Estimating the magnitude of employment distortions in insured small firms is essential in refining reforms to the small group health insurance market...|$|R

However, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L.111-203), which {{was signed into law}} on July 21, 2010, made the $250,000 insurance limit permanent. In addition, the Federal Deposit <b>Insurance</b> <b>Reform</b> Act of 2005 (P.L.109-171) allows for the boards of the FDIC and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to consider inflation and other factors every five years beginning in 2010 and, if warranted, to adjust the amounts under a specified formula.|$|E
25|$|During 2009, as Congress debated {{proposals}} for health <b>insurance</b> <b>reform,</b> Romney {{said that he}} was in favor of increased health insurance portability, coverage of pre-existing medical conditions, a cap on malpractice lawsuits, the implementation of a streamlined electronic medical records system, an emphasis on preventative care, loosening restrictions on importation of prescription drugs, and tax benefits aimed at making health insurance more affordable for the uninsured and targeted to promote universal access. He said he opposed efforts to provide non-emergency health coverage to undocumented immigrants and he supported the Hyde Amendment prohibiting government funding for elective abortion. Romney opposed a federal single-payer system, but supported state efforts to reduce the uninsured population.|$|E

25|$|The new {{government}} called the Legislature back in session in late 2003, and passed {{a series of}} bills relating to its election promises.

25|$|During {{the years}} before {{the changes in the}} state law related to the {{enactment}} of the federal PPACA, the state still used the free care pool—renamed the Health Safety Net—both as originally intended and to fund the subsidies for free (under 150% of FPL) and almost free (151–300% of FPL) networked health care insurance. In addition the state spent a substantial amount of general revenue on the <b>insurance</b> <b>reform.</b> Based on the combination of the increased Health Safety Net tax, general revenue (state income and sales taxes were increased 20%) and smaller additional taxes, the cost of the reform reached about 2% of the state's annual budget in fiscal year 2013, which ended June 30, 2013, up from 1.5% in fiscal 2011.|$|E
25|$|Douglas's {{number one}} {{concern was the}} {{creation}} of Medicare. He introduced medical <b>insurance</b> <b>reform</b> in his first term, and gradually moved the province towards universal medicare {{near the end of his}} last term. In the summer of 1962, Saskatchewan became the centre of a hard-fought struggle between the provincial government, the North American medical establishment, and the province's physicians, who brought things to a halt with the 1962 Saskatchewan doctors' strike. The doctors believed their best interests were not being met and feared a significant loss of income as well as government interference in medical care decisions even though Douglas agreed that his government would pay the going rate for service that doctors charged. The medical establishment claimed that Douglas would import foreign doctors to make his plan work and used racist images to try to scare the public.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 and 2010, {{much more}} {{substantive}} {{changes were made}} to the law, {{one of the most important}} of which was to begin an open enrollment period for those receiving subsidized health insurance and anyone buying insurance, including those paying full price, as an individual. Prior to that 2010 change, under the Massachusetts law, residents buying healthcare insurance individually could do so at any time, even—theoretically—as being admitted to a hospital or entering an emergency room. This led to a gaming of the system and research by the state said this gaming added 1%-2% to premium costs, which were continuing to rise for other reasons as well. Given the continuing overall rise in premiums post Massachusetts 2006 healthcare <b>insurance</b> <b>reform,</b> the major goal of the 2012 amendment was to introduce price controls on health care itself; it is not directly related to healthcare insurance as are the earlier legislative actions.|$|E
