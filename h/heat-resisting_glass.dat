50|$|The Mercantile Bank {{is located}} on Old Market Square, Kuala Lumpur. It cost $4 million, and {{consisted}} of two floors below street level and 11 floors above. It is 144 feet high and has a total floor area of over 100,000 square feet. The whole {{upper part of the}} building is sheathed with a gold anodised aluminum grille which lent the structure a distinctive appearance. The grille was not only decorative, it deflected the sun’s ray and thus, in conjunction with <b>heat-resisting</b> <b>glass,</b> saved considerably on cooling costs. Marble paving and wall cladding gave an air of luxury to the main floors. The columns on the ground floor entrance foyer were black Venetian mosaic. The entry floor surface utilized white marble paving and was enclosed in glass and aluminum. The main banking hall featured white Italian marble floors and teak paneled walls. The entire building was air-conditioned. The plant for this, plus machinery for three fully automatic lifts, controlled by an intricate electronic “brain”, was on the roof. It is now occupied by Pacific Express Hotel.|$|E

The {{plan is a}} long rectangle with an apse at the east end and a vestry off one side. The entrance is on the south, towards the west end; it {{is marked by a}} square tower with a colonnaded lantern at the top surmounted by a weathervane carrying the symbol of St Peter. The organ gallery is above the entrance, whence it is approached by a stair, and opens on to a gallery overlooking the nave. The font is placed immediately opposite the entrance in a gap in the seating, which leaves a few seats between it and the west wall for use at christenings. The pulpit is in brick, and is placed in the south-east corner... The windows have steel frames, and are glazed with <b>heat-resisting</b> <b>glass</b> with a slightly greenish tinge, which helps to give a cool appearance to the interior. The ceiling is of wall board, set out in panels, the sides of the recesses being brilliantly coloured to tone with the windows and the ceiling of the eastern apse."The furnishings, altar, pews and other fittings, designed by the architects, were made from local hardwood. The cost of building was £2,755 19s 5d.|$|E
