40|$|The {{transpiration}} {{characteristics of}} Acanthopanax brachypus {{and their relationship}} with the ecological factors of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), air temperature and air relative humidity etc, were studied in two habitats of <b>open</b> <b>land</b> and under-forest in this paper. The transpiration curve of Acanthopanax brachypus in two habitats belonged to single-peak type. The maximum transpiration rate and diurnal average transpiration rate of Acanthopanax brachypus on <b>open</b> <b>land</b> were higher than those in forest. PAR was the most important ecological factor affecting the transpiration rate in forest. On <b>open</b> <b>land,</b> air temperature and relative humidity had significant effects on the transpiration rate; PAR had a little effect on transpiration rate. Water use efficiency on <b>open</b> <b>land</b> was higher than that in forest. Based on the preliminary analysis of water physiological ecology of Acanthopanax brachypus, it was concluded that <b>open</b> <b>land</b> with better water conditions was suitable for its growth...|$|R

50|$|The Mettawa <b>Open</b> <b>Lands</b> Association (MOLA) is a {{non-profit}} organization which promotes quality open space within the village and encourages the protection {{of public and private}} <b>open</b> <b>lands.</b> MOLA supports Mettawa-area residents and <b>open</b> <b>lands</b> (including unincorporated housing developments that are surrounded by village land) with public workdays and educational programs, and provides quality open space management on village properties. In celebration of Mettawa's 50th anniversary in 2010, MOLA distributed complimentary wildflower seed packets to all village residents and to many residents in neighboring areas, and suggested that recipients plant the seeds along roadsides to help beautify the area.|$|R

50|$|The name Swafield {{possibly}} originates from <b>open</b> <b>land</b> with a track {{from the}} Anglo Saxon words swaeth, meaning track, and feld, meaning field, often a forest clearing. The former is {{the origin of}} swath or swathe, the latter of field. The name may also mean therefore, <b>open</b> <b>land</b> with swathes, the latter being areas of cut, laying corn.|$|R
40|$|Growth and {{morphology}} {{of young}} seedling of cinnamomum camphora and Bothrocaryun controversum, two familiar species in Three Gorges Reservoir region, {{in relation to}} three light regimes (<b>open</b> <b>land,</b> gap and understory) are investigated here. We have measured relative indices of the young seedlings in three light regimes which have grown for two years. The results show as follows: in <b>open</b> <b>land,</b> the seedlings of C. camphora and B. controversum demonstrate that the absolute growth(main stem height, collar diameter, shoot biomass, root biomass, and total biomass) is higher than that in gap or understory, while that of the seedlings in <b>open</b> <b>land</b> is significantly higher than that in understory(p. In respect of morphological characteristics, the root and shoot ratio of the seedlings of C. camphora are not significantly different in three light regimes, but that of the seedling of B. controversum in <b>open</b> <b>land</b> is significantly higher than that in gap or understory(p< 0. 05), which demonstrate that the seedlings of B. controversum in <b>open</b> <b>land</b> suffered photoinhibition to a certain extent. When the PPFD decreases, the slenderness coefficeient and the leaf area ratio of the two species increases, while the total leaf ares {{and the number of}} leaves decreases. The net assimilation rate and the relative growth rate of the two species both demonstrate that the seedlings in <b>open</b> <b>land</b> or gap land are significantly higher than that in understory(p< 0. 05),However, the net assimilation rate and the relative growth rate between the two species demonstrated no significant differences at any light regime. These results indicate that the seedlings of C. camphora and B. controversum in <b>open</b> <b>land</b> accumulate the most biomass, and some suitable shelter can keep the seedlings from photoinhibition, which makes seedlings grow quickly...|$|R
