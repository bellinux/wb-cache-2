40|$|Flows over <b>hydraulically</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>walls</b> are {{predominant}} in turbulence studies whereas real {{surfaces in}} engineering applications are often rough. This {{is important because}} turbulent flows close to {{the two types of}} surface can exhibit large differences. Unfortunately, neither experimental studies nor theoretical studies based on conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can give sufficiently accurate, detailed information about unsteady turbulent flow behaviour close to solid surfaces, even for <b>smooth</b> <b>wall</b> cases. In this thesis, therefore, use is made of a state of the art computational method “Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) ” to investigate the unsteady flows. An “in-house” DNS computer code is developed for the study reported in this thesis. Spatial discretization in the code is achieved using a second order, finite difference method. The semi-implicit (Runge-Kutta & Crank-Nicholson) time advancement is incorporated into the fractional-step method. A Fast Fourier Transform solver is used for solving the Poisson equation. An efficient immersed Boundary Method (IBM) is used for treating the roughness. The code is parallelized using a Message Passing Interface (MPI) and it is adopted for use on a distributed-memory computer cluster at University of Aberdeen as well as for use at the UK’s national high-performance computing service, HECToR. As one of the first DNS of accelerating/decelerating flows over <b>smooth</b> and rough <b>walls,</b> the study has produced detailed new information on turbulence behaviours which can be used for turbulence model development and validations. The detailed data have enabled better understanding of the flow physics to be developed. The results revealed strong non-equilibrium and anisotropic behaviours of turbulence dynamics in such flows. The preliminary results on the rough wall flow show the response of turbulence in the core and wall regions, and the relationship between the axial and the other components are significantly different from those in <b>smooth</b> <b>wall</b> flows.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the decay of {{chlorine}} in pipes of drinking water distribution networks due to wall and bulk demand. Accurate prediction of chlorine decay is important, as both chlorine concentrations which are too low and too high pose serious health risks, the former due to pathogen formation and the latter due {{to the formation of}} disinfection by-products. Water quality models used for the prediction of chlorine decay make use of parameterisations for the wall demand in the form of Sherwood number Sh correlations, which couple the wall mass flux to a Reynolds number Re, Schmidt number Sc and wall roughness. These correlations are subject to significant uncertainty, particularly for turbulent flows. A combined analytical and numerical approach is taken to study in detail the interaction between flow, turbulence and mass transport, with the aim of improving the understanding and accuracy of wall demand parameterisations for chlorine. Simulations of the chlorine decay in an axisymmetric pipe with <b>hydraulically</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>walls</b> were performed for Re = 104 to 106 and Sc = 1000 using Reynolds averaged conservation equations. These values are typical for chlorine transport in distribution networks. The simulations confirmed that the assumptions made in water quality models for chlorine wall demand are valid. Asymptotic solutions for high Sc solutes were developed which are applicable both to linear and nonlinear wall reactions. Results showed that the Sh correlation is independent of the reaction type. For rough walls, the two main wall demand parameterisations are mutually inconsistent: one is valid for low and the other for high wall demand coefficients only. Numerical simulation of flow and high Sc mass transport over a dtype rough surface at Re = 2. 5 × 105 showed that the inconsistency between the two parameterisations was caused by the geometry. For low wall demand coefficients, the existence of roughness elements causes higher wall demand than for a <b>smooth</b> <b>wall.</b> However, at high wall demand coefficients the maximum wall demand achievable in the cavities was much smaller than for the crests. Hence, the effective surface area and therefore the wall demand became lower than for a <b>smooth</b> <b>wall.</b> A parameterisation was developed which reproduced the solute mass decay over the entire range of wall demand coefficients. Most of the solutions and parameterisations developed in this thesis are on the same level of description as water quality models. The findings of this thesis can be used as supportive evidence for the validity of assumptions made for water quality models, and to inform how processes should be modelled when these assumptions are violated.

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to analyse the interaction between a vortex ring and a sloped sediment layer. Attention focussed on interactions under “critical” conditions, in which sediment motion was only just induced by the ring's flow field. Both <b>hydraulically</b> <b>smooth</b> and <b>hydraulically</b> rough bedforms were analysed, using near-spherical monodisperse sediments with relative densities of 1. 2 and 2. 5 and mean diameters (d p) ranging between 80 and 1087 [*]μm. Measurements of the vortex-ring flow field were obtained, during the interaction, using two-dimensional particle imaging velocimetry. The threshold conditions for incipient sediment motion were analysed {{in terms of the}} critical Shields parameter (N c), defined in terms of the peak tangential velocitymeasured adjacent to the bed surface. Bed-slope effects were investigated by tilting the sediment layer at various angles between the horizontal and the repose limit for the sediment. In all cases, the propagation axis of the vortex ring was aligned normal to the bed surface. The measured values of N c were compared with a force-balance model based on the conditions for incipient grain motion on a sloping bed. For <b>hydraulically</b> <b>smooth</b> bedforms, where the bed roughness is small compared to the boundary-layer depth, the model was derived to account for how viscous stresses affect the drag and lift forces acting on the near surface sediment. For hydraulically rough bedforms, where this viscous-damping effect is not present, the model assumes the drag and lift forces scale with the square of the near-bed (inviscid) velocity scale. In both cases, the model predicts that bedforms become more mobile as the bed slope is increased. However, the damping effect of the viscous sublayer acts as a stabilizing influence for <b>hydraulically</b> <b>smooth</b> bedforms, to reduce {{the rate at which the}} bed mobility increases with bed slope.

For the two sizes of spheres in a square arrangement (11 and 49 wall units in diameter, yielding <b>hydraulically</b> <b>smooth</b> and transitionally rough flow, respectively), the spatial structure of drag, lift and spanwise torque is investigated.

Our previous effort has demonstrated the soundness of a CFD approach in modeling the detailed fluid dynamics of tank slosh and the excellent accuracy in extracting mechanical properties (slosh natural frequency, slosh mass, and slosh mass center coordinates). For a practical partially-filled <b>smooth</b> <b>wall</b> propellant tank with a diameter of 1 meter, the damping ratio is as low as 0. 0005 (or 0. 05 %).

Near-spherical monodisperse sediments were used throughout with relative densities of 1. 2 and 2. 5 and mean diameters(d) ranging between 80 and 1087 μm. Interaction characteristics were analysed {{in terms of}} the critical Shields parameter θc, defined using the peak root mean square (r. m. s) horizontal velocity component in the near-bed region. Bed slope effects on θc were investigated by tilting the bed (and the grid) at angles between 0 and the repose limit. In all cases, the grid was aligned to be parallel to the bed surface, so that the oscillation direction is always normal to bed surface. The measured values of θc on a horizontal bed were comparable to the values reported in the traditional Shields diagram with θc seen to increase monotonically for <b>hydraulically</b> <b>smooth</b> bedforms and to be approximately constant for hydraulically rough bedforms. To account for bed slope effects, the measured values of θc were compared with a force-balance model based on the conditions for incipient grain motion on a sloping bed. For <b>hydraulically</b> <b>smooth</b> bedforms, where the bed roughness is small compared to the boundary-layer depth, the model was derived to account for how viscous stresses act to damp the drag and lift forces acting on the near surface sediment. For hydraulically rough bedforms, where this viscous-damping effect is not present, the model assumes the standard approach with the drag and lift forces scaling with the square of the near-bed (inviscid) velocity scale. In both cases the model predicts the bedforms to become more mobile as the bed slope is increased. However, the damping effect of the viscous sublayer acts as a stabilizing influenced for <b>hydraulically</b> <b>smooth</b> bedforms, to reduce {{the rate at which the}} bed mobility increases with bed slope. The measured values of θc in the hydraulically rough bedforms were in agreement with the trends predicted by this model. However, measured θc in smooth bed cases were lower than predicted, and fall on the hydraulically rough trend when bed slope is < 20. When the bed slope reaches the repose limit, θc falls between the smooth-bed and rough-bed cases. Measurements of sediment trajectories due to the turbulence interacting with the bed were obtained, for a range of impact conditions. Observations of the sediment trajectories during the interaction show the individual sediment grains to be predominantly displaced in a circular 'splash'.
