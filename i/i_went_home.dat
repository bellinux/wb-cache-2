500|$|The duo were {{disappointed}} with their performance, particularly Garfunkel, {{who felt that}} he sang poorly. Simon {{said that he did}} not immediately realize the magnitude of the event: [...] "I didn't get what had happened– how big it was– until <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> turned on the television and saw it on all the news ... and later that night on the front pages of all the newspapers.

I brought it to Hov that night, he heard it, {{he thought of the}} video treatment before he thought of the rap. He just knew it was gonna be the one.|$|E
500|$|The album cover, {{designed}} by Spinetta, shows a distressed {{man with his}} hair covered by a scarf and a tear running down his cheek; a toy arrow is stuck on his head, and {{he is wearing a}} pink shirt with the name of the band. Spinetta used tempera and pencils on mat paper. RCA considered the artwork incomprehensible and noncommercial, and shelved its first version. Spinetta said, [...] "We were not going to allow the record to be released without it. I had the picture in my head very clearly, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> and did it again. We did not want to leave things in the hands of mediocre company dudes that make album covers like [...]" [...] Emilio García said in 2008 that the label thought most record buyers were women, and artwork should depict men as handsomely as possible: [...] "They could not believe it, because the cover of an LP (at the time) featured artists' faces or holding electric guitars; we came out with a cover like that, which I still consider absolutely great." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{completing}} The Elephant Man (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth {{had read}} and enjoyed Lynch's Ronnie Rocket script, {{but did not}} think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. [...] "I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> and thought of the ear in the field." [...] Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that Blue Velvet was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. [...] "After Dune I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment." [...] Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.|$|E
500|$|During summer 2001, Black Isle Studios {{employed}} three development teams. These {{included the}} Icewind Dale team, the team developing Torn, {{and a team}} working on an unannounced project. Before and during Torns development, several members of its team expressed interest in developing another game using the Infinity Engine. The development team was not made aware of Black Isle Studios' decision to develop Icewind Dale II until Torns cancellation. Lead designer J. E. Sawyer described, [...] "I don't know when the producers {{decided to make the}} game, but I was told that we were making the game when I learned that TORN was being cancelled ... on a Wednesday afternoon", and that Feargus Urquhart [...] "asked me to work with Steve Bokkes to create a story and area overview by Thursday afternoon. Steve and I talked about {{it for the rest of}} the day. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> that night and worked on the overviews until the next day. I came in and turned the docs in, and after the Friday division meeting, the project was in development." [...] During this period, Interplay Entertainment relied on Black Isle Studios' games to alleviate financial trouble, which put pressure to release games quickly. The decision to develop Icewind Dale II was based partly on the original Icewind Dales reception, and the development teams' ability to create a game with the Infinity Engine relatively quickly. Sawyer said of the decision, [...] "In all honesty, the reasons for making Icewind Dale II have to do with limiting risks and maximizing our chances for a popular title." [...] Conceptualization of Icewind Dale II progressed during the development of the Icewind Dale expansions, and production began late July 2001, shortly after the completion of [...] After six months of development, Icewind Dale II was officially announced on February 4, 2002.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard and the Church of Scientology {{presented}} {{a number of}} different accounts of his time in the western Pacific. In 1963, Hubbard told Australian journalists that he had been [...] "the only anti-aircraft battery in Australia in 1941–42... There was me and a Thompson submachine gun... I was a mail officer and I was replaced, I think, by a Captain, a couple of commanders and about 15 junior officers." [...] Hubbard stated on another occasion that he had been [...] "one of the first officers back from the upper battle areas" [...] and that he had [...] "sent on my own authority, four cargo ships loaded to the gunwales with machine gun ammunition, rifle ammunition and quinine up to MacArthur." [...] When [...] "Melbourne found out ... there were enough troops in the area so the danger was over, so <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home.</b> I wrote myself some orders and reported back to the US." [...] According to the Church of Scientology, Hubbard was landed on the island of Java [...] "in the closing days of February 1942" [...] to search for [...] "stockpiled weapons and fast, shallow-draft vessels." [...] He was cut off by invading Japanese [...] "and was only able to escape the island after scrambling into a rubber raft and paddling out to meet an Australian destroyer." [...] Another Church of Scientology account describes Hubbard as [...] "Senior Officer Present Ashore in Brisbane, Australia" [...] and asserts that [...] "his duties included counter-intelligence and the organization of relief for beleaguered American forces on Bataan. It was in this latter capacity that he eventually saw action on the island of Java, and only eluded capture through a daring escape on a raft. In a 1956 lecture to Scientologists, Hubbard said: ...|$|E

2500|$|After the Giants won Super Bowl XLII, Tuck {{achieved}} {{a new level}} of celebrity in his native Alabama. [...] "It was interesting when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> (to Alabama)," [...] Tuck said. [...] "You couldn't go anywhere without people asking for your autograph or telling you congratulations or how proud they were of you and things like that." [...] The newfound celebrity also extended to New York, where Tuck and Giants wide receiver Amani Toomer were honored by Congressman Charles Rangel at the ball field at Harlem River Park on February 20, 2008. The community celebration was in honor of the Giants' Super Bowl XLII victory.

2500|$|It {{must have}} been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were {{required}} to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6p.m. curfew. I had gone {{to play with a}} Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others – the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting.

2500|$|In {{the initial}} {{concept of the}} series, the three females' boss would be a millionaire who often aided them in their assignments; however, Jackson and Spelling {{decided it would be}} more {{interesting}} to have the boss's identity remain a secret. With this, millionaire Charlie Townsend was an unseen character on the series who only spoke to the Angels via a Western Electric Speakerphone. John Forsythe, who played the unseen Charlie Townsend, directing the 'Angels' crime-fighting operations over a speaker-phone, recorded his lines in an audio studio and was never on set. Thus, Forsythe rarely met any of his female co-stars. Some years later, he bumped into Farrah Fawcett-Majors at the tennis courts, as he recalled, [...] "I was coming off the court when she {{came up to me and}} said, 'Charlie! I finally met Charlie!'". Forsythe was offered the 'Charlie' role in a panicky late-night phone call from producer Aaron Spelling after the original choice, American film, stage and television actor, Gig Young, showed up too intoxicated to read his lines. [...] "I didn't even take my pajamas off – I just put on my topcoat and drove over to Fox. When it was finished, Aaron Spelling said, 'That's perfect.' And <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> and went back to bed".|$|E

2500|$|Welsh {{classical}} singer Katherine Jenkins {{recorded a}} cover version of [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] on her 2009 album Believe. Jenkins said: [...] "I'd mentioned that I {{wanted to try}} Evanescence's Bring Me to Life and David [...] said 'you can't sing that'. I came out there questioning my vocal abilities. I'm just not used to being told that. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> that night and I just thought to myself 'you have to pull yourself together, he's worked with so many incredible artists you {{have to step up}} the plate.' I did talk myself round and I went in there the next day on a mission. It's good to be pushed sometimes – and I proved him wrong!" [...] Jenkins decided to change the [...] guitar-led and percussive original version and instead, [...] "make it more orchestral with the percussion coming from the strings." [...] Alfred Hickling of The Guardian gave a mixed review of Jenkins' cover, calling it [...] "histrionic." [...] However, a writer of BBC Online chose her version of the song as a highlight on the album. On October 23, 2009, the song was available for digital download as the second single from Believe. On November 23, 2011, Jenkins sang the song live at the Leicester Square station in London.|$|E
2500|$|I had {{a terrific}} {{friendship}} with Sheila Florance. In fact she acted in {{my very first}} film, and we always used to joke that I would make her a star. When I heard suddenly that she was dying of cancer I visited her immediately. There was no sentimentality or anything on her part—she was an incredible woman—but she said jokingly, 'There is still time to turn me into a star, but let's be quick.' <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> and spent three days and three nights writing the script and then with Barry Dickins and Sheila we did another draft. She was given eight weeks to live and so we made A Woman's Tale with this hanging over us. This motivated us, of course, but Sheila had a degree of greatness about her. She was a very powerful woman. It was an amazing challenge {{to make a film}} about life, in the face of death. To get the money of course was impossible and I had to pawn everything I had. People have asked me how we did it but to some extent we were idiotically courageous in taking this risk. Sheila and I joked all the time. I would say to Sheila, [...] "Please don't die on me or you'll kill me". She would reply, [...] "Don't worry I'll be a good girl." ...|$|E
