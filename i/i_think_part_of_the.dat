And I think Cornelia probably wanted to know the answer to that question too. So once it was, it just became a snowballing thing and then that really got her out there and led to the acclaim and popularity of her work." [...] It was this that motivated director Iain Softley and the casting department to consider Fraser first for the role in the film.

Softley was ultimately impressed with Fraser's performance and contracted him for the film.

[...] Inkheart was filmed at Shepperton Studios near London, England and on location in Balestrino, Albenga, Entracque and Laigueglia, Italy, in 2006 and 2007. [...] A lot of the things that we tried to do are more to do with optical illusion, the sleight of hand....It feels very organic and very real, and I actually think it makes the magic more effective. I think that there is a sort of discounting that goes on in the minds of an audience when they know that it's sort of a computer world or a digital world. It's like, 'Oh, they can do anything. They can press a button for however many weeks they need at a machine.' Whereas if you actually get the sense that it's something more like the craft of illusion, I think that it's more magical, actually.

40|$|The nineteenth-century {{settlement}} of the Great Plains coincided {{with a number of}} technological developments, including improved railroad equipment, the steel plow, and the agricultural combine. Photography was among these technical developments, ensuring that the process of settlement would be both celebrated and recorded. The history of Junction City, Kansas, is bound up with such technological developments. Located near the junction of the Republican and Smoky Hill Rivers, it grew close by the site of Fort Riley in north central Kansas and became a railroad town and county seat by the 1870 s. By 1890 the community was prosperous and its economy diversified. Enter photographer J. J. Pennell. One of the region 2 ̆ 7 s many local photographers who established thriving businesses to record family, civic, and commercial life, Pennell operated in Junction City for nearly three decades.

If I were asked to write a prescription for social and psychological disaster among Native peoples, something that would surely bring about a near total collapse of their ancient societies, it would go something like this: Initially, I would put them on reservations and take away their art. In this way I would sever them from their mythology, philosophy, history, religion, land, and language in one stroke since all of these are fundamentally integrated or embodied in their social systems through their land and art. Art is the primary means by which they effectuate what is equivalent to Western society 2 ̆ 7 s libraries, churches, courthouses, theaters, and schools. I would then legislate laws, enforceable at the point of a gun, of course, which would allow me to replace their accumulated wealth of oral, historical, and spiritual knowledge and traditions with my own special brand of social philosophy, economics, and religions, all based upon a social system relying heavily upon avarice as its most basic social tenet and coupled with the identification of those Native peoples as 2 ̆ 2 primitives and savages. 2 ̆ 2 That law would then be enforceable for at least seventy years in such places as government run boarding schools. I would then insist upon using unprovable abstract scientific theories to describe the different versions of reality these ancient peoples harbor towards themselves. Furthermore, I would require everybody to use the same vernacular established by these parochial theorists whenever the subject of the Native American came up, in whatever context...|$|E
40|$|Compensation - {{necessary}} for control Cue: In March of 2006, Cameroon reported its first {{cases of the}} H 5 N 1 avian flu virus. The outbreaks occurred {{in the north of}} the country, where most poultry are local birds kept by small-scale farmers; there are few commercial flocks. To prevent the disease from spreading, the government used the standard control strategy, slaughtering all domestic poultry, both healthy and diseased, within a 30 kilometre radius of the outbreak. People within this area were asked to declare all their poultry to the veterinary authorities, so that they could be slaughtered, a process known as culling. The government also paid financial compensation to the farmers for all birds that were slaughtered. The outbreak of avian flu in Cameroon was successfully controlled, not least because of the compensation that was given to the farmers. So why is paying compensation so important in controlling an outbreak? To {{find out more about the}} reasons for offering compensation, and how the process worked in Cameroon, Martha Chindong spoke to Dr Linus Chimangha, an inspector in the Cameroonian ministry responsible for agriculture. IN:		?I will say compensation is one ?? OUT:		??have hope in our poultry sector. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 20 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Linus Chimangha of the agriculture ministry in Cameroon was speaking to Martha Chindong. The interview comes from a radio resource pack on avian flu produced by CTA. Transcript Chimangha	I will say compensation is one of the things involved in stamping out the disease. It involved culling, or the massive killing of all the birds where the outbreak was detected, and when these birds are killed we now go into compensation of the farmers involved. What happened is that a census of all the people within that radius who had poultry was conducted. They counted the chickens to know who has what, and then after that the teams which were mobilised destroyed all these birds in a systematic way, and then the farmers concerned were compensated, and the compensation which was put in place was 2000 francs per chicken or duck or goose, and for pigeons it ranged from 500 francs to 1000 francs. Chindong	Was there any form of registration, or were they just counted like this and compensated? Chimangha	No previous registration, except for people who maybe had commercial poultry flocks. But announcements were made for them to own up and come and declare that they had chickens, and when they declared that they had chickens the technicians went out to ensure that the chickens were actually seen, and then they counted them. Chindong	Was there any form of discrimination? Chimangha	No discrimination whatsoever. If you had 10 chickens and they were counted and destroyed you were compensated. If you had 20, or 50 ? and again, whether you were a man or a woman or a child, everybody was treated just the same. Chindong	You said that compensation, financial compensation was 2000 francs per chick. Is it not too small? Chimangha	Not at all. Some people may consider that it is small for the fact that if they maybe took their chickens to the market they could have sold for 2500 francs or 3000, but there in the north chickens are generally very cheap. Then again, within this time of the outbreak, you know that there was this psychosis, this general depression, and people were scared of consuming poultry products. So at that time chickens were selling just too cheap. You could buy a big chicken for more than?if anything just between 500, 700 or maximum 1000 francs. Even eggs, they were being sold as cheap as 25 francs per egg. So this measure was even welcomed by the farmers for the fact that all their chickens had to be cleared away, and the government at least gave them something, so the farmers really appreciated the measures that were instituted. It was in no way small. And this helped to encourage, for the fact that there was compensation, it helped to encourage the people, so that if there were any sick fowls around, they would come out voluntarily and declare, they would not try to hide them and take them and sell them in the market clandestinely. So everything was well done, and I think it is thanks to these measures which were instituted that the situation was brought under control. Chindong	Can that be termed the significance of compensation, or is there another significance? Chimangha	I think this is the significance, the importance of it. First to bring the disease under control, to motivate the farmers so that they don?t feel so depressed, and equally so that the farmers can have some little money and keep on in business when the disease is eventually brought under control. Chindong	Now that reminds me, what is the ministry doing to re-launch this poultry sector, because farmers are really down? Chimangha	We had a meeting in May, which was really a brainstorming with all the poultry producers in Cameroon and their representatives, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> request made by the farmers to the government was to see how they can mobilise funds and give some micro-credit, some loans to poultry farmers, particularly to those smallholders. And then to see how people who incurred no matter what loss around that time, they could be compensated. Because within that period of outbreak it was only this culling procedure which was implemented in the areas where the disease was discovered, it was only those people who were compensated. But many other people who incurred some losses because their products were not being bought, they have not been compensated, so there was an appeal made to government that such cases could also be considered. In Bafousan so many thousands of eggs, more than some 36, 000 were lost. Here in Yaound‚, hatcheries, they destroyed a lot of day old chicks, a lot of layers; so most of those people they are praying that the government will do something. Chindong	Any other thing that you would love us to discuss? Chimangha	Just to say that the general fear that was brought into people?s minds with the outbreak of the bird flu, it is dying down, and really it should die down. People should not be afraid. They should consume poultry products as much as possible, but have them well boiled. Their chickens and their eggs, they should be well boiled. And people should be encouraged to go into poultry production, because with all the measures being put into place, even if the disease comes now I think we are better placed to fight it than we used to be before. So let us have hope in our poultry sector. End of track. Why compensation for slaughtered birds is important, how a compensation system was managed in Cameroon...|$|E

40|$|Diversifying crops {{for food}} and trade Suggested introduction: Across the Caribbean {{it is clear that}} {{agriculture}} needs to diversify. The loss of preferences in EU markets, for example, threatens the economic viability of traditional export crops such as sugar and bananas, and if farmers are to survive they will need to change what they grow, and how they grow it. So what are the options? One basic question is whether countries that traditionally import most of their food should be looking to increase the amount and variety of food crops grown on their own soil. Or should they simply grow other cash crops with strong export potential and sell these to fund continuing food imports? It?s a question that came under discussion at a recent conference focussing on food and nutrition security held in Belize. Susanna Thorp spoke to several participants about their vision of the future of agricultural diversity and trade, and how these link to the nutrition and food security of Caribbean people. In this report she begins by asking extension agent and agronomist, Richard Allport, about the situation regarding food, nutrition and trade, in his home country of Dominica. IN:		?Generally Dominica has always been considered [...] ? OUT:		? themselves as well as trade internationally. ? DUR?N		 8 ? 58 ? Back announcement: Sandra Plummer of the FAO ending that report on the links between crop diversification, income generation and supply of food in the Caribbean. Transcript Allport	Generally Dominica has always been considered as a food secure nation in terms of its food balance. Generally we have exported more food than we have imported in terms of value. However {{over the last few years}} we have seen some deterioration in the food and nutrition situation because we have seen some declines in the economy. Thorp	So why in particular has there been an impact on the economy, why has that been declining in the last couple of years? Allport	I think the major reason has been the decline of the banana industry and the whole question of the WTO negotiations and the impact on our economy. We now have a very open economy and many times we have been flooded with cheaper imports. That has caused a decline in incomes to farmers and as a result it has caused us to have less disposable income. Thorp	So what are you trying to do as an extension department to try and support farmers in this serious situation? Allport	The most effect that we can have is to try to raise productivity among farmers so that they can increase incomes. But we also would like our production to be consumed locally and many times we bring up issues of protection. Under our WTO obligations we cannot protect but there still is a reason why we need to protect our farmers. Furthermore I think that if our farmers are not protected it means that our country?s ability to even purchase from outside in the long run is affected. So if the economy is totally destroyed our ability to import is also destroyed or compromised. Thorp	And what about trying to diversify? If farmers have relied heavily on growing bananas in the past but this is not going to be a viable option in the future, what other options for growing other crops, perhaps more nutritional crops are there? Allport	Well the options are always there in terms of diversifying to feed our population. That is why I consider us still food secure. But then our ability to export agricultural produce is always compromised. So I think that is where the resources have to be put. Do we really have a comparative advantage in terms of exporting to other countries out there? So I think those are the real issues, it is not just the ability to feed ourselves but can we diversify into other crops that we can export like we did bananas for so many years. Thorp	And what about the issues of raising productivity, I mean how feasible is it to raise productivity beyond what you are doing already? Allport	I think it is feasible. We really have to embrace science and technology. But sometimes - even under our WTO obligations - raising productivity requires infrastructure and sometimes people see the required infrastructure as subsidies and they ask us not to subsidise. When the developed world?s agriculture is highly subsidised both in the EU and in the US. So those are other concerns of ours. Thorp	What about with policymakers, do you feel that they are doing enough to resolve the situation? Allport	I think our policymakers see it, but I think many times our hands are tied in terms of the kind of resources that we can generate to make those changes. I mean we are a poor underdeveloped country striving to compete in the developed world. NARR	In St Kitts and Nevis the government is already in the process of planning which crops it should prioritise, as it reduces its dependence on sugar exports. Jeffrey Berry, an extension officer with the Department of Agriculture, is concerned that this process is ignoring the capacity that the country?s own farmers have, to contribute to the national food supplies. Berry	Yes we have to feed a nation, but are the people, the population, the farmers benefiting from feeding ourselves? Thorp		Presumably they are not? Berry	They are not because what is really happening is that when we set out to look what crops should we produce we are looking from a marketing point of view as to what crops can we produce competitively, not necessarily to feed our nation. So I think somewhere along the line we have to draw the line and to break a kind of equilibrium as to production first of all in feeding yourself, feeding up to at least certain basic commodities. Thorp	Is there a possibility of being able to diversify so that farmers can grow some competitive crops but they can also be encouraged to grow nutritionally valuable crops too? Berry	That is the approach we are trying to do because St Kitts is moving out of sugar right now. I think this year is the last year that we are producing sugar for export. So we are looking at a diversification programme. And I think this is the downfall of the whole thing: we are going about it kind of one sided in the sense that we are just looking at it from a marketing point of view as to what kinds of crops we can produce competitively. I think we have to look at producing other crops that are nutritionally beneficial for the nation, on a smaller scale, but I think that is an integral part that we have to look at apart from the crops that we are producing to be competitive. NARR	While Jeffrey Berry stresses the importance of farmers growing at least some of their crops for domestic consumption, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation is currently running a pilot project to support farmers in production of some alternative cash crops. Sandra Plummer, a food security specialist with the project, which is operating in the 15 member states of CARICOM plus the Dominican Republic, explained how it is working. Plummer	You know that we have a lot of problems in terms of especially sugar and banana because of the erosion of the preferences with the European Union. I think countries are now in transition, in terms of where they should go where they would not be so dependent upon those preferences. Thorp	So what is the FAO pilot project doing to support farmers in this transition phase? Plummer	The project actually is attempting to improve the productivity of these selected crops and it is basically cash crops with the potential for trade in what we call the non-traditional commodities which find markets in places like Canada, the United States. Especially in those areas where you have the West Indian diaspora who are accustomed to eating a particular type of food and they are willing to buy it. So there is a kind of niche market there. Thorp	So what sort of interventions or technologies are you putting into place in order to support the growing of those crops? Plummer	The technology that is being used is drip irrigation because in many countries they have a problem of water and the management of the water. Thorp	So with having irrigation does this allow farmers to grow crops outside the traditional seasons? Plummer	That is exactly the whole point because what happens is that I can give you an example of one village in a country where everybody grew the same kind of crop. So you had a glut during the actual reaping season and then between seasons you had a deficit in terms of availability of food as well as availability of income. So the drip irrigation actually helps to stagger the production throughout the year so that the troughs and the heights of the cycle will actually be reduced. So you get little blips instead of huge hills and valleys. Thorp	So are there countries where there are particular lessons that would be valuable do you think that are already coming out of the project? Plummer	The country which has gone the furthest and has actually started to reap the first crop cycle is Belize. And I think Belize has the advantage and it is probably the reason why they were one of the first countries to actually start the production, in that they already have an intersectoral Animal Health and Food Safety Agency which co-ordinates all the requirements from the Ministries of Health and Agriculture and Trade. And hence it makes it easier for persons who are wishing to export crops. They do not need to go to eight different departments. They can go to one agency and get all the paperwork and documentation done. Thorp		So how do you see the way forward for the future? Plummer	I think in terms of regional development, as in Caribbean region, we hope to get a framework of food and nutrition security strategy for the region, which would then be able to advise programmes and plans of action of the different CARICOM and CARIFORUM member states. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process is the establishment of, for example, regional databases, regional marketing intelligence, so countries can all access it and be able to trade amongst themselves as well as trade internationally.
