Agency by exit thereby expands our understanding of what strategies of coping, reworking and resistance entail. We base our arguments on a case study of the “Not below 24, 000 ” movement among nurse students and newly graduated nurses for acceptable entry wages in Sweden.

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the sleep problems most often encountered by the elderly according to the presence or absence of anxiety and mood disorders. The aim was also to determine whether groups of anxious, depressive, and asymptomatic individuals differ in relation to sleep onset latency; awakenings at night or early in the morning; subjective quality of sleep; taking of sleep medication; and daytime sleepiness. Methods: Structured interviews based on the DSM-IV-TR were administered to a sample of 2, 759 seniors aged 65 years and older at the participants’ home by health professionals. Results: Awakening was found to be the most common disturbance. Increased sleep onset latency was the second most frequent sleep difficulty. Taking more than 30 minutes to fall asleep was associated with the likelihood of meeting the diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder, and even reduced the risk of meeting the diagnostic criteria for a mood disorder rather than an anxiety disorder. Awakenings were associated with the probability of suffering from an anxiety disorder or a mood disorder. Quality of sleep, as perceived by the elderly, was not found to be associated with the probability of suffering from a mental disorder.

Second, in countries characterized by weak enforcement, strong board-level monitoring appears to enhance financial reporting quality, thus suggesting a substitutive effect between firm- and country-level governance. Third, in countries characterized by strong enforcement, firms with strong board-level monitoring exhibit a higher level of financial reporting quality than firms with weak board-level monitoring, thus suggesting that country- and firm-level governance are complementary.

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increased}} interest in Romeʼs connections with the Far East {{over the course of}} the last 20 years. This has resulted in the publication of many articles and monographs about the Roman involvement in the Red Sea which was the key maritime region linking the Far East with the West. This thesis synthesizes the recent scholarship on the Red Sea trade in Late Antiquity by merging all of the most up to date information into a concise narrative. In order to accomplish this, three major sources of information have been analyzed. Firstly, the historical time frame of all of the major regions of the Red Sea including Egypt, Aksum, and Himyar have been laid out in a straight forward narrative. This offers the most pertinent background information for the development of Red Sea trade. Secondly, the most up to date archaeological evidence has been incorporated into a description of the ancient maritime trade infrastructure of the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. The archaeological evidence broadens our knowledge of the roads through the Eastern Desert of Egypt, the ports of the Red Sea, and the development of the Indian subcontinent more generally. Thirdly, this thesis builds on all of the historical as well as archaeological data and attempts to quantify the impact of Red Sea trade on the Late Antique Roman Empire both economically and culturally. This synthesis helps to elucidate the growing conception among Late Antique scholars that the Roman Empire was far more interconnected with its eastern neighbours.

40|$|Qin music {{comprises}} {{three basic}} kinds of tones: open-stringed, stop-stringed sounds, and harmonics. Its intricate fingerwork provides <b>further</b> <b>nuances</b> to the sound, while its aesthetics {{is influenced by}} philosophical ideas. This thesis explores two significant perceptual characteristics of qin music: multilayered monophony and sliding tones. 'Multilayered monophony' refers to the way that enculturated listeners hear multiple audible streams or voices in the qin's monophonic melodies, as if produced by several instruments of an ensemble rather than a single instrument, and within qin culture is attributed to multilayered interplay between contrasting tones of Yin and Yang. Sliding tones are produced after the initial pluck to extend and continuously modify the pitch. These extensions are faint and even become inaudible, leaving the sound of frictional sibilance, which produces intermittent silence in qin melodies. This forms the basis for qin aesthetic conception of soundlessness (wu sheng). These interpretations reveal the influence of Taoist philosophy: the dualism of Yin and Yang is the basic concept of Taoist philosophy, while the concept of soundlessness reflects the important Taoist concept of emptiness (kong), or non-being (wu). By addressing these features of qin music, this thesis aims to understand {{the way in which}} traditional qin music has been perceived and received by enculturated listeners. This thesis analyses selected recordings of qin pieces and explores how the characteristics of multilayered monophony and inaudible sliding inflections are produced, perceived, and conceptualised as aesthetic meanings. This research crosses disciplines of music analysis, traditional qin studies, as well as music perception and cognition. It examines how multilayered monophony and inaudible sliding inflections contribute to the perceived intricacy and subtleness of qin music. From a broader perspective, it also contributes to understanding of how musical structures afford particular kinds of aesthetic interpretation with the influence of specific philosophical ideas.

40|$|This study {{examines}} a legal experiment {{that occurred during}} the height of the global financial crisis. As markets from the United States to Europe to the Global South shook, one country – the United Arab Emirates – found itself on the brink of economic collapse. In particular, in 2009 the U. A.

Recognizing that such a default would have cataclysmic reverberations across the globe, Dubai’s governmental leaders turned to a small group of foreign lawyers, judges, accountants, and business consultants for assistance. Working in a coordinated fashion, these external and internal actors soon imported into the Emirate a new regime of insolvency laws – and even an Anglo-American insolvency court – to help resolve Dubai’s financial troubles.

40|$|There are {{seventeen}} {{million people}} in the world who are stateless, not considered as citizens by any state. They suffer due to the current function of citizenship in the nation-state system, occupying a legal space outside of the system, yet, their lives are very much blighted by the system itself. This research examines the possibility that global citizenship could be a means to address statelessness. Global citizenship, unlike (national) citizenship, is, in theory, inclusive, and membership is based on our shared humanity. However, when approaching the global citizenship literature, two concerns became apparent. First, there is a significant lack of theorisation on the stateless in the discourse, and second, some scholars make the assumption that a global citizen has citizenship of a state – which the stateless do not. To begin to overcome these concerns, this research develops and implements a stateless centric perspective on global citizenship, using it to analyse the situation of the stateless in the case of Lebanon. The stateless centric approach developed here, views global citizenship through the actions and perspectives of those addressing statelessness. With four large and protracted stateless populations, Lebanon provides an empirically rich context, within which to undertake this research. The findings of the stateless centric perspective problematise the received wisdom of citizenship, the nation-state and allows for the exploration of the expressions and tensions in the practices of global citizenship. Drawing on a contextualised understanding of these practices, a ‘patchwork’ approach to global citizenship is proposed. This sees the creation of a public political space as an act of global citizenship, when it draws on universal principles. These universal principles are used to justify this space, taking on an instrumental role. It is a patchwork as these spaces can be seen in the wider global context, as either directly or indirectly connected, through their shared use of universal principles. By centralising the stateless in our conceptualisations of the nation-state, citizenship and global citizenship, the value of taking a stateless centric perspective, and its ability to draw out <b>further</b> <b>nuances</b> in the debate, is shown...|$|E

In both Hirsi and CPCF asylum seekers were detained using military state powers, but the length of detainment varied significantly from 10 h in Hirsi to 1 month in CPCF. The Australian judges did state that the threshold of safety, closely linked to the principle of non-refoulement, is a requirement of Australian laws but with a close 4 – 3 judgement, concluded in favour of the Australian government, claiming the executive acted within the parameters of the Maritime Powers Act (2013), passed by the Australian government after the M 70 judgement. As distinct from Hirsi and M 70 with the CPCF case, the High Court of Australia held that detainment at sea for the purpose of preventing arrival of unauthorised migrants to Australia and push back to safe port was lawful.|$|R

Etruria, which began as a significantly more powerful entity than Rome, was brought to heel through the establishment of bilateral treaties and Roman colonies. This study seeks an even <b>further</b> <b>nuanced</b> model for {{the nature of the}} conquest of Etruria-namely looking at the underlying mechanisms that made the treaties and colonies successful. Social network analysis is particularly well suited for this task as it visualizes interaction and exchange between sites which often times dictates a sites success or failure. When enlarged to the regional scale SNA can be used to understand how a region prospers or declines based on site interactions. For my study I used SNA to discuss how Roman conquest affected Etruscan exchange networks-especially economic exchange networks-and how this network transformation was used to control the region of Etruria. The results show that Rome all but replaced the previous Etruscan network with their own Imperial network that seems, based on preliminary research, centered on strategically selected administration centers in Etruria-utilizing both native Etruscan sites and newly inaugurated Roman colonies...|$|R
40|$|Scenario {{planning}} {{is a method}} widely used by strategic planners to address uncertainty about the future. However, current methods either fail to address the future behaviour and impact of stakeholders or they treat the role of stakeholders informally. We present a practical decision-analysis-based methodology for analysing stakeholder objectives and likely behaviour within contested unfolding futures. We address issues of power, interest, and commitment to achieve desired outcomes across a broad stakeholder constituency. Drawing on frameworks for corporate social responsibility (CSR), we provide an illustrative example of our approach to analyse a complex contested issue that crosses geographic, organisational and cultural boundaries. Whilst strategies can be developed by individual organisations that consider the interests of others - for example in consideration of an organisation&# 039;s CSR agenda - we show that our augmentation of scenario method provides a <b>further,</b> <b>nuanced,</b> analysis of the power and objectives of all concerned stakeholders {{across a variety of}} unfolding futures. The resulting modelling framework is intended to yield insights and hence more informed decision making by individual stakeholders or regulators. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the recent phenomenon of West Africans leaving the African continent and seeking work in Spain. By the year 2003, a barely noticeable blip on the screen of the age-old phenomenon that is migration became a conspicuous trend. Depending on one's perspective this trend is either a natural flow of people from one region to another, or it is an alarming turn of events that needs immediate global attention. However, when it involves significant loss of life - as does the sea journey of the poorest aspirants - surely all who ponder the migrant question would agree that this qualifies as a crisis. The next question becomes, then, is it best to focus on minimizing the risks or to focus on deterring the would-be migrants {{at the onset of}} their journey? This question and its possible answer are <b>further</b> <b>nuanced</b> by whether those determined to leave receive incentives for choosing to stay at home or whether government officials and others who respond to the crisis in both sending and receiving countries practice a forceful type of deterrent that merely halts the process of migration but does not tackle the issue of why the person chose to leave in the first place...|$|R
