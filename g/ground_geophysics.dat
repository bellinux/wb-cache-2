Subsequent geological mapping and <b>ground</b> <b>geophysics</b> have demonstrated that the anomalies coincide with and match the width of bedrock outcrop of the Moffat Shale Group. Ground-based geophysical surveys show variations in conductivity with highest values corresponding to carbon-rich mudstones.

40|$|The {{climate is}} a forced and {{dissipative}} nonlinear system featuring non-trivial dynamics {{of a vast}} range of spatial and temporal scales. The understanding of the climate’s structural and multiscale properties is crucial {{for the provision of}} a unifying picture of its dynamics and for the implementation of accurate and efficient numerical models. We present some recent developments at the intersection between climate science, mathematics, and physics, which may prove fruitful in the direction of constructing a more comprehensive account of climate dynamics. We describe the Nambu formulation of fluid dynamics, and the potential of such a theory for constructing sophisticated numerical models of geophysical fluids. Then, we focus on the statistical mechanics of quasi-equilibrium flows in a rotating environment, which seems crucial for constructing a robust theory of geophysical turbulence. We then discuss ideas and methods suited for approaching directly the non-equilibrium nature of the climate system. First, we describe some recent findings on the thermodynamics of climate and characterize its energy and entropy budgets, and discuss related methods for intercomparing climate models and for studying tipping points. These ideas can also create a common <b>ground</b> between <b>geophysics</b> and astrophysics by suggesting general tools for studying exoplanetary atmospheres. We conclude by focusing on non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, which allows for a unified framing of problems as different as the climate response to forcings, the effect of altering the boundary conditions or the coupling between geophysical flows, and the derivation of parametrizations for numerical models.

40|$|A recent {{evaluation}} of Martis Creek Dam highlighted {{the potential for}} dam failure due to either seepage or an earthquake on nearby faults. In 1972, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed this earthen dam, located within the Truckee Basin {{to the north of}} Lake Tahoe, CA for water storage and flood control. Past attempts to raise the level of the Martis Creek Reservoir to its design level have been aborted due to seepage at locations downstream, along the west dam abutment, and {{at the base of the}} spillway. In response to these concerns, the U. S. Geological Survey has undertaken a comprehensive suite of geophysical investigations aimed at understanding the interplay between geologic structure, seepage patterns, and reservoir and groundwater levels. This paper concerns the geologic structure surrounding Martis Creek Dam and emphasizes the importance of a regional-scale understanding to the interpretation of engineering-scale geophysical data. Our studies reveal a thick package of sedimentary deposits interbedded with Plio-Pleistocene volcanic flows; both the deposits and the flows are covered by glacial outwash. Magnetic field data, seismic tomography models, and seismic reflections are used to determine the distribution and chronology of the volcanic flows. Previous estimates of depth to basement (or the thickness of the interbedded deposits) was 100 m. Magnetotelluric soundings suggest that electrically resistive bedrock may be up to 2500 m deep. Both the Polaris Fault, identified outside of the study area using airborne LiDAR, and the previously unnamed Martis Creek Fault, have been mapped through the dam area using <b>ground</b> and airborne <b>geophysics.</b> Finally, as determined by direct-current resistivity imaging, time-domain electromagnetic sounding, and seismic refraction, the paleotopography of the interface between the sedimentary deposits and the overlying glacial outwash plays a principal role both in controlling groundwater flow and in the distribution of the observed seepage...|$|R
40|$|This poster {{presents}} {{ongoing investigation}} into the archaeological potential of airborne and terrestrial remote sensing data from the Boyne Valley, eastern Ireland. The dataset being investigated (Tellus Border Project) was collected during low-level (59 m agl) surveys for regional environmental mapping purposes completed in 2012. Magnetic, electromagnetic and radioelement data were recorded and defined background geo-environmental values for rock, soil and water. The combination of sensors provides geophysical and geochemical parameters used to define regional soil/land types or zones. These zones are examined for possible correlations with ‘archaeological zones’ or zones of archaeological potential. Comparative legacy remote sensing, geological and archaeological datasets include multi-spectral imagery, aerial photography, LiDAR, <b>ground</b> <b>geophysics,</b> geological and soils data and monument locations. Based on the current results the next step will focus on more detailed studies in the Boyne Valley.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This article {{shows the}} results of the {{development}} of a procedure called TC-ASA index which is based on the contrast of magnetic and radiometric prop-erties between host rocks and the mineralization, being interpreted as the probability of occurrence and defining ambience where iron formation to occur. It consists in subtracting the values of total count (TC) from the analytic signal (ASA), which are products of gammaspectrometry and magnetic methods, respectively. This index was applied to the actual data referring to the iron formations of Curral Novo do Piauı́, where the main mineral is magnetite, thus characterized by high magnetic susceptibility and often associated with metabasic rocks. These rocks often present low concentration of radioactive elements, enabling the identification of geolog-ical environment with potential for occurrence of iron ore. The use of this procedure allowed for the reduction of the exploration area, providing a fast target se-lection for geological mapping, geochemistry and <b>ground</b> <b>geophysics.</b> In addition, it supplies with important elements that will assist mining companies in setting strategic priorities...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{during the}} Holocene {{has not been}} stable, and with {{predictions}} of human induced climate change {{it has become increasingly}} important to understand the underlying ‘natural’ dynamics of the global climate system. Fluvial systems are sensitive respondents to and recorders of environmental change (including climate). This research integrates meta-data analysis of a New Zealand fluvial radiocarbon (14 C) database with targeted research in catchments across the Northland region to determine the influence of Holocene climate change on river behaviour in New Zealand, and to assess whether or not Northland rivers are in synchrony with global climate change. The research incorporates 14 C dating and meta-analysis techniques, sedimentology, <b>geophysics,</b> <b>ground</b> survey (RTK-dGPS) and Geographic Information Systems analysis to investigate the response of New Zealand and Northland rivers to Holocene climate and anthropogenic change. The emerging pattern of Holocene river behaviour in New Zealand is one of increased river activity in southern regions (South Island) in response to enhanced westerly atmospheric circulation (promoted by negative Southern Annular Mode [SAM]-like circulation), while in northern regions (North Island) river activity is enhanced by meridional atmospheric circulation (promoted by La Niña-like and positive SAM-like circulation). In Northland, Holocene floodplain development reflects the interplay between valley configuration and accommodation space, sediment supply, fluctuation in climate and anthropogenic factors in the last several hundred years. Evidence from Northland rivers suggests that a globally extensive abrupt climate change signal can promote a synchronous fluvial response, overprinting complex regional patterns of Holocene river behaviour. The research demonstrates that at the centennial-scale, regional atmospheric circulation change is a key driver of river behaviour, with anthropogenic catchment disturbance responsible for enhanced river activity and floodplain aggradation in the last ~ 500 years. It is therefore likely that any future climate change involving a shift in the atmospheric circulation regime {{will have an impact on}} river behaviour in New Zealand. However, at the catchment- or reach-scale, river response will be largely determined by local controls such as sediment supply and accommodation space, with these factors largely moderated by the post-settlement fluvial history...|$|R

40|$|The BGR {{supports}} the Government of Uganda in the geoscientific {{investigations of the}} Buranga geother-mal prospect since 2004. The objective of the project is to raise the knowledge about Buranga to a level (pre-feasibility status) that can be the base for plan-ning of exploration wells. Geochemical findings, which have been achieved {{in the framework of}} the joint project, proofed the exis-tence of a magmatic body that in all probability serves as the heat source of the hot springs. Hence the task of active <b>ground</b> <b>geophysics</b> was detecting and delineating this magmatic intrusion. The known high seismicity (about 300 local earthquakes per month) suggested that Buranga provides excellent pre-conditions to apply seismology. From May 2005 to August 2006 up to 15 seismologi-cal stations were deployed to record local earth-quakes in the Buranga region. The tomography of the seismic data is expected to yield two results: • delineation of the magmatic intrusion at depth and • delineation of the active faults/fault systems by an exact localization of the hypocenters. First results will be presented here. They will be reinforced and better elaborated when all the data will be included. Low velocity anomalies, supposed to represent the magmatic intrusive bodies, are shown in horizontal and vertical sections and are constituted at depths levels even below 15 km...|$|E
40|$|A trial {{airborne}} electromagnetic (AEM) {{geophysical survey}} {{was carried out}} across a 13 × 9 km area of the northern Nottinghamshire (UK) coalfield. One of the objectives {{was to examine the}} influence of coal mines (collieries) and associated spoil heaps situated above the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone aquifer. The conductivity models obtained from the AEM survey revealed extensive zones of enhanced subsurface conductivity in the vicinity of all the collieries in the survey area. The present study provides information regarding subsequent investigations (<b>ground</b> <b>geophysics</b> and borehole) to confirm the AEM results and to investigate the geochemical nature of the conductive zone identified in the vicinity of one of the collieries. Following ground geophysical confirmation of the airborne results, three boreholes were drilled into one of the conductive zones to the east of a working colliery. Geophysical logs and analysis of pore fluid geochemistry demonstrate that there is a very strong correlation between the borehole induction logs (formation conductivity), total dissolved solids (TDS) and chloride in the pore waters. The three cored boreholes have confirmed that there is a groundwater plume with high concentrations of TDS, compared with background, moving east from the Thoresby Colliery on a hydraulic gradient of 0. 023. Porewater geochemistry obtained from core has been compared with that of local aquifer waters and with samples obtained from the colliery. The results indicate that the plume chemistry could result from the mixing of a typical Sherwood Sandstone composition with colliery spoil leachate. The AEM conductivity models have been successfully correlated with ground geophysical models, borehole induction logs, TDS and chloride in the pore waters. By implication, the geophysical results obtained over a larger area indicate the wider extent of such impacts in relation to both former and current mining activitie...|$|E
40|$|The Damara-Katanga orogen in central-southern Africa {{represents}} {{an area of}} 1. 73 xl 0 ⁶ sq. km. The region {{is considered one of}} the wealthiest metallogenic provinces in the world. Successful exploration for stratabound base-metal deposits has taken place at this particular area since the introduction of more organised methodology in the early 1920 s. The genesis, location and distribution of the ore deposits are related to their tectonic settings. Geodynamic evolution of the orogen, which initially formed part of a complex Pan-African rift system, comprises the following stages rifting; downwarping, including spreading on the western portion; syn-orogeny and late-orogeny. Two major tectonic events in the history of the region have been identified: the Katangan (900 - 750 Ma) and the Damaran episodes (750 - 500 Ma). Timing of mineralisation of ore deposits has been related to the evolutionary stages of the orogen. Genetic models of the most productive deposits are briefly discussed in this dissertation. The sedimentological, geochemical, paleogeographic and structural features can be employed as geological guidelines for integrated exploration programmes. Discoveries of major deposits and prospects in the orogen are also summarised, focussing on the exploration methods employed. The cost-effective use of the exploration techniques includes the classical copper-lead-zinc soil sampling for residual soils such as those in the Copperbelt area. Airborne magnetics and electromagnetics and follow-up <b>ground</b> <b>geophysics</b> have proved successful in areas where the cover is transported in the search for shallow ore deposits such as the Matchless massive sulphides. Remote sensing, geochemical and geophysical techniques have been tried in covered areas of western Botswana. The lack of geological control makes this interpretation difficult. A detailed geological mapping and the use of geochemical and geophysical techniques has been used to delineate carbonate-hosted base-metal deposits at the Otavi Land. The more expensive traditional methods necessary for the delineation of orebodies, such as pitting, trenching and drilling, are also discussed. Using a sequential approach, a possible exploration strategy is suggested, outlining the cost-effective use of remote sensing, geochemical and geophysical techniques. Standardisation in basic geological information is required for future successful explorations in the Damara-Katanga orogen, as well as attractive mining policies. In the event of their implementation, exploration perspectives are promising, specifically in terms of ore potential. ...|$|E
