500|$|At 18, Davidson {{participated in}} a tryout for {{aspiring}} eventers run by Neil Ayer and Jack le Goff, {{who were trying to}} build the United States team to an international level. He had talent, and according to LeGoff, [...] "He didn't know which diagonal he was posting when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Two years later, he was riding in the Olympics." [...] Davidson was chosen, and began training with the USET in a four-year, seven-day-a-week program in Gladstone, New Jersey.|$|E
500|$|Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} Ron Swanson's jazz musician alter ego before they learned Nick Offerman actually played the saxophone in real life, and had for his entire life. Offerman praised the decision: [...] "When <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'You're {{going to have an}} alter ego who plays jazz saxophone,' I go, 'How do you see inside me?'" [...] After the episode broadcast, NBC created an official [...] "Duke Silver" [...] website, which included a biography, discography, reviews, gallery, tour schedule and booking information for the fictional band.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} shot on March 12, 2010 in Los Angeles, {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. Mandler previously worked with Drake {{on the video}} for his collaboration with Mary J. Blige, [...] "The One". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I think is an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I do all that, but I’m also somebody that’s asking, is that what I should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> because he wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{who will}} tell him? Some one must tell him before <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Should there not be some one to tell him? They have sent another message." ...|$|R
2500|$|... “The {{conductor}} {{went around}} and collected tickets and when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I handed him my ticket and {{he refused to}} take it. [...] It {{was one of the}} Omnibus railroad tickets, one that I had purchased of them previous to that time. [...] He replied that colored persons were not allowed to ride. [...] I told him I had been in the habit of riding ever since the cars had been running. [...] I answered that I had a great ways to go and I was later than I ought to be.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On 8 August 2012, Russian {{president}} Vladimir Putin {{said that}} the intense fighting began on 6 August 2008. [...] "The information what was happening {{at the time of}} the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th of the (August 2008), I received directly from Tskhinvali. Oddly enough, from journalists. Because the journalists had taken to my press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, and <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and, with reference to them, the witnesses of events taking place there, informed of hostilities," [...] he said. Putin also underlined that not one day, but three days passed before the decision was made to send troops to South Ossetia. Asked about his personal role, Putin said, [...] "While in Beijing, I called Dmitry Medvedev and the defense minister twice, on August 7 and 8." [...] Putin's statement about his phone talks with Medvedev after the outbreak of large-scale hostilities contradicted Medvedev's 2011 statement that he had no phone talks with Putin and they had contact only the next day. Putin's statement on Russia having a plan since 2006 contradicted earlier claims that Russia acted in response to Georgia's [...] "surprise attack" [...] to prevent a [...] "genocide" [...] and to defend Russian citizens.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, Clewer. <b>He</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> for his French. It's {{his first}} term, and he's almost as {{complete}} a wreck as you were, Beetle. He's not naturally clever, {{but he has}} been hammered till he's nearly an idiot." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The horses won't {{be there}} {{if there is}} a really hard frost. Nobody would stir. It will be the first {{question}} I shall ask the man when <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and if there have been seven or eight degrees of frost I shan't get up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{expect you}} dreamt it all," [...] I ses. [...] "Where would pore Sam get a gold watch and chain from? And why should ’e {{go to you}} about it? Why didn’t <b>’e</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> If <b>’e</b> thinks I ’ave got it let ’im <b>come</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R

"He is a {{young man}} of {{excellent}} principles," [...] Lord Arranmore said, dryly, [...] "taking life as seriously as you please, and I should imagine is too well balanced to make anything but a very safe husband.
