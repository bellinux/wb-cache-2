5|$|All {{types of}} cooking {{involved}} the direct use of fire. Kitchen stoves {{did not appear}} until the 18th century, and cooks <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how to cook directly over an open fire. Ovens were used, but they were expensive to construct and only existed in fairly large households and bakeries. It was common for a community to have shared ownership of an oven {{to ensure that the}} bread baking essential to everyone was made communal rather than private. There were also portable ovens designed to be filled with food and then buried in hot coals, and even larger ones on wheels that were used to sell pies in the streets of medieval towns. But for most people, almost all cooking was done in simple stewpots, since this was the most efficient use of firewood and did not waste precious cooking juices, making potages and stews the most common dishes. Overall, most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a fairly high fat content, or at least when fat could be afforded. This was considered less of a problem in a time of back-breaking toil, famine, and a greater acceptance—even desirability—of plumpness; only the poor or sick, and devout ascetics, were thin.|$|E

To form the battle line in the correct {{orientation}} relative to the enemy, the commanding admiral <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the enemy fleet's distance, bearing, heading, and speed. It was {{the task of the}} scouting forces, consisting primarily of battlecruisers and cruisers, to find the enemy and report this information in sufficient time, and, if possible, to deny the enemy's scouting forces the opportunity of obtaining the equivalent information.|$|E

25|$|Praetextatus {{published}} the Latin {{version of the}} Analytics written by Aristotle, in the Greek version composed by the philosopher Themistius; It is possible that Praetextatus knew Themistius, either meeting him in Constantinople or when the philosopher visited Rome (in 357, when Themistius followed Emperor Constantius II {{as leader of the}} Senate of Constantinople, or in 376, when Themistius honoured Emperor Gratian with a speech in the Roman Senate), and it is known he could read Greek, as he {{had been one of the}} quindecimvir sacri faciundi, who <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Greek in order to read Sybilline books.|$|E
25|$|The third {{suspect in}} Macnaghten's report {{was a man}} named Michael Ostrog, a Russian-born thief and con man who {{affected}} several aliases and disguises and was detained in asylums in several occasions. Again {{there is little to}} support this suspicion against Ostrog: records indicated that he was imprisoned in France during the murders. The fact that Ostrog was arrested and imprisoned before the report was written raises the question of why Ostrog was included at all as a viable suspect. A possible answer has been postulated involving Eton College. Ostrog had stolen from Macnaghten's beloved alma mater and the police chief may have included the Russian in his reports as a private act of revenge. From late 1894 Macnaghten <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that Ostrog had been cleared of the Whitechapel crimes, yet he still persisted with his inclusion and what is more projection into the public sphere as a Ripper suspect (via literary cronies).|$|E
25|$|Genealogy of Grigoriy Zhukovsky, Odessa citizen, {{attributed}} to the poet Vasily Andreyevich Zhukovsky (1783-1852). The verses and fairy-tale of this poet were included in school program in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and could be earlier and up today. Also biography of Vasily Andreyevich Zhukovsky the pupils <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> As per Soviet school program from the 1950s and up to {{second part of the}} 1980s or beginning of the 1990s the father of this poet was the landlord Andrey Grigoriyevich Zhukovsky (died in 1817) and as per legend his father was the landlord Afanasiy Ivanovich Bunin (1716—1791) and the mother was the captive Turkish girl Salha, she was named by Christian name Yelizaveta Dementiyevna Tutchaninova. Their illegitimate boy, as per legend, was adopted by the landlord Andrey Grigoriyevich Zhukovsky and named Vasiliy Andreyevich Zhukovsky. Turkey joined the NATO in 1952 and in the 1960s or earlier the NATO was able to watch and listen to the Northern part of the Black Sea, including Odessa. It is why Turkish girl Salha was included in the legend. The landlord Andrey Grigoriyevich Zhukovsky, the father of poet, had Polish family name Zhukovsky and the landlords with this family name left in the Eastern Prussia before Swedish and then German invasion in the Eastern Prussia. It is why Soviet Intelligence wished to present Zhukovsky family in Odessa as representatives of Prussian Zhukovsky family branch. To avoid any person of Zhukovsky family in Odessa began thinking about the Royal title, the legend of the Bunin family was introduced. And it was done successfully. During the rule of Mikhail Gorbachev this legend was presented as the correct version to stop this Intelligence activity.|$|E

500|$|The {{main problem}} with the Act was {{whether or not the}} {{claimant}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> he had a method of action or not for the standard limitation period to apply. The House of Lords had an opportunity to resolve this in Central Asbestos Co Ltd v Dodd but [...] "failed spectacularly", making a decision so confused that the Court of Appeal in Harper and others v National Coal Board said they could not actually find a ratio decidendi anywhere in the House of Lords' opinion. The Act also suffered from drafting problems - in Central Asbestos Lord Reid described it as having [...] "a strong claim to the distinction of being the worst drafted Act on the statute book". The Act was repealed piecemeal by a series of Acts during the 1970s, and the Limitation Act 1980 finally repealed the last remaining sections.|$|E
500|$|Ponsford was a shy person, on {{the field}} and off. Robinson wrote that Ponsford [...] "was so {{reserved}} that you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> him for three years or the duration of a Test tour before his reticence relaxed." [...] Similarly, when photographed Ponsford would hang his head so his cap would cover most of his face. This shyness intensified after his retirement. He would often walk along laneways to his work at the MCC, rather than be recognised {{on the way to the}} train station. While on the train, he would cover his face with the newspaper. At work, he disliked interaction with the public and would direct staff to advise visitors that he was not in, despite often being clearly in view. Bill O'Reilly said of Ponsford, [...] "He spoke rarely and even then only if he could improve on silence." [...] Nonetheless he was popular with his teammates and was said to have a droll sense of humour.|$|E

500|$|On Monday morning, Nixon flew to Los Angeles, making {{notes for}} his speech aboard the plane. He jotted {{down the line}} he had said in Eugene {{regarding}} his wife's coat. He made notes concerning the family finances, upsetting Pat Nixon, who asked why people <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> their financial details. The senator responded that people in politics live in a fishbowl. He recalled the Fala speech, in which Franklin Roosevelt had sarcastically responded to Republican claims he had sent a destroyer to fetch his dog, Fala, and remembered the dog his children had recently received: A Texas traveling salesman named Lou Carrol had read a report that Pat Nixon said her children Tricia and Julie [...] "longed" [...] for a dog, and his own dog, an American Cocker Spaniel, had just had a litter. After a telegram exchange, he crated the puppy and shipped it by rail to the Nixons, and six-year-old Tricia Nixon named the dog [...] "Checkers". Nixon decided that including the anecdote evoking FDR would needle his enemies and delight his friends.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Davis {{started working}} on Freerider (5.12d), a 38-pitch climb on El Capitan. Her aim was to free climb the route. In {{order to be able}} to achieve this in one climb, she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the route through and through, so she practiced it extensively. Two to three times a week, she would hike 10 miles to the summit, rope solo [...] to the lower parts of the route and climb up alone. Potter belayed her, during her actual attempt in April 2004. After a grueling four-day climb, she became the first woman to free climb the route. In May, with Heinz Zak {{belaying}} her, she became the second woman, after Lynn Hill, to free climb El Capitan in a day.|$|E

2500|$|Regardless of the music, Rachmaninoff always planned his {{performances}} carefully. He {{based his}} interpretations {{on the theory}} that each piece of music has a [...] "culminating point." [...] Regardless of where that point was or at which dynamic within that piece, the performer <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how to approach it with absolute calculation and precision; otherwise, the whole construction of the piece could crumble and the piece could become disjointed. This was a practice he learned from Russian bass Feodor Chaliapin, a staunch friend. Paradoxically, Rachmaninoff often sounded like he was improvising, though he actually was not. While his interpretations were mosaics of tiny details, when those mosaics came together in performance, they might, according to the tempo of the piece being played, fly past at great speed, giving the impression of instant thought.|$|E
2500|$|While Gardiner {{was only}} {{allowed to vote}} in Metro Council to break ties, he was a voting member of all four policy {{committees}}. The committees would do the early work of working through proposals preparing them for Council. Gardiner prided himself on his work ethic, the same style he had used since his days at high school. [...] "I {{was not going to}} change my way of proceeding. It was more necessary than ever. My diagnosis was that if I was going to get anywhere I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> more about any given subject than any individual councillor, and more about metropolitan business as than all the members of council combined." [...] Gardiner would wait to speak on important resolutions after others had spoken. When a close vote was anticipated, Gardiner went around the council table, rebutting objections one by one.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} prior to opening the Smith Center, UNC {{basketball}} played its home games in Carmichael Auditorium (now Carmichael Arena). Although Carmichael was fairly new, having opened in 1965, basketball's popularity overwhelmed the 10,180-seat facility, and [...] "you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> somebody who knew somebody" [...] {{to get into a}} game. As early as 1979, talks began for a new arena. With the hope of accommodating every fan who would want to attend a game the plans became very ambitious. Money was raised entirely from private donations, using neither university funding nor taxes. According to David Halberstam's biography of Michael Jordan, Smith did not want the arena named after him, but was persuaded by the UNC administration and the arena's backers that fundraising efforts for the facility could fail if they did not use his name. The site chosen for the arena was a wooded ravine south of the main campus, and construction began in 1982. On the first day of construction, contractors were banned from wearing Duke or N.C. State apparel on the job site.|$|E

2500|$|Al Michaels {{was criticized}} by the New York Post for not {{broadcasting}} the game and seeming uninterested in the NBA in general. Barry Horn of The Dallas Morning News said that Michaels was simply [...] "not a basketball guy". Meanwhile, Bill Simmons said during the 2005 Finals that Michaels [...] "shows up for these games, does his job, then drives home thinking, ‘Only five weeks to the [...] Hall of Fame Game, I'm almost there!’" [...] Another criticism that Michaels received was that he too often found himself making tediously long-winded explanations. In return, he would tend to talk over two or three possessions in a row (which Michaels seemed to be better suited for football and baseball broadcasts, for which he's better known for). The end result {{was that he would}} hardly have time to comment on the action viewers were seeing because he was so hung up on a prior subplot or storyline that he felt the audience just <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about. Michaels was also accused of apparently lacking the kind of enthusiasm and confidence (for instance, Michaels initially reacted to Amar'e Stoudemire's block of Tim Duncan's shot during the 2005 playoffs by calling it a [...] "great, great contested shot") expected of a main play-by-play voice.|$|E
2500|$|Combat {{operations}} on Bougainville {{ended with the}} surrender of Japanese forces on Bougainville on 21 August 1945. [...] The Empire surrendered in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. The last phase of the campaign saw 516 Australians killed and another 1,572wounded. 8,500Japanese were killed at the same time, while disease and malnutrition killed another 9,800 and some 23,500troops and labourers surrendered {{at the end of}} the war. Of the casualties suffered during the second phase of the campaign, historian Harry Gailey wrote: [...] "it was a terrible toll for an island whose possession after March 1944 was of no consequence in bringing the war to a close ... That the Australian soldiers performed so well when they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that what they were doing was in the larger sphere unnecessary and unappreciated at home says much for the courage and the discipline of the ordinary Australian infantryman". In contrast, Australian historian Karl James has argued that the 194445 Bougainville campaign was justifiable given that it could not be known at the time that Japan would surrender in August 1945, and there was a need to both free up Australian forces for operations elsewhere and liberate the island's civilian population. Of the civilian population, according to James it is estimated that potentially up to 13,000 of the pre-war population of 52,000 died during the war.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the filming}} of the Kung Fu TV movie began, there was some {{discussion}} {{as to whether or}} not an Asian actor should play Kwai Chang Caine. Bruce Lee was considered for the role. In 1971, Bruce Lee wasn't the cult film hero he later became for his roles in The Big Boss (1971), Fist of Fury (1972), Way of the Dragon (1972) and Enter the Dragon (1973). At that point he was best known as Kato on TV's Green Hornet (1966–1967) (Kung Fu guest actor Robert Ito reports that Lee hated the role of Kato because he [...] "thought it was so subservient"). [...] "In my eyes and in the eyes of Jerry Thorpe," [...] says Harvey Frand, [...] "David Carradine was always our first choice to play Caine. But there was some disagreement because the network was interested in a more muscular actor and the studio was interested in getting Bruce Lee." [...] Frand says Lee wouldn't have really been appropriate for the series—despite the fact that he went on to considerable success in the martial arts film world. The Kung Fu show needed a serene person, and Carradine was more appropriate for the role. Ed Spielman agrees: [...] "I liked David in the part. One of Japan's foremost Karate champions used to say that the only qualification that was needed to be trained in the martial arts was that you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how to dance. And on top of being an accomplished athlete and actor, David could dance." [...] Nonetheless, grumbling from the Asian community would have made sense, given the fact that major roles for Asian actors were almost nonexistent. James Hong, an actor on the show and ex-president of the Association of Asian/Pacific American Artists (AAPAA) says that at the time Asian actors felt that [...] "if they were going to do a so-called Asian hero on Kung Fu, then why don't they hire an Asian actor to play the lead? But then the show went on, we realized that it was a great source of employment for the Asian acting community." [...] In fact, Hong says, Carradine had a good relationship with the Asian community.|$|E
