25|$|The {{common opinion}} is that the nail enters inside the paronychium, but an <b>ingrown</b> <b>toenail</b> can simply be {{overgrown}} toe skin. The condition starts from a microbial inflammation of the paronychium, then a granuloma, which results in a nail buried inside of the granuloma. While ingrown nails can occur in the nails of both the hands and the feet , they occur most commonly with the toenails.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ingrown</b> <b>toenails,</b> {{hallux valgus}} and Morton's neuroma are common {{problems}} in family practice.

50|$|In shoe-wearing cultures, Morton's toe can be problematic. For instance, wearing {{shoes with}} a profile {{that does not}} {{accommodate}} a longer second toe may cause foot pain. A small (80-person) study found {{no statistically significant difference}} in the frequency of longer second toes between people with and without <b>ingrown</b> <b>toenails,</b> but tight and ill-fitting shoes are generally considered to increase the risk of <b>ingrown</b> <b>toenails,</b> and shoes are often too tight on the toes.|$|R

25|$|Surgical {{treatment}} for an ingrown nail {{is carried out}} by a podiatrist, a foot and ankle specialist. This is typically an in-office procedure requiring local anesthesia and special surgical instruments. The surgical approach is {{the removal of the}} offending part of the nail plate known as a wedge resection. If the <b>ingrown</b> <b>toenail</b> recurs despite this treatment, destruction of the sides of the nail with chemicals or excision is done; this is known as a matrixcestomy. Antibiotics may be used after the procedure but are not recommended, as they may delay healing. Surgical {{treatment for}} ingrown nails is more effective at preventing the nail from regrowing inwards compared to non-surgical treatments.|$|E
500|$|On January 13, 2009, Mota {{returned}} to the Dodgers upon signing a one-year contract. His second stint with the Dodgers {{got off to a}} bad start, as he posted a 9.00 ERA in his first 15 games of the season. However, his statistics improved when he compiled a 0.26 ERA over his next 29 games to lower his season ERA to 2.92. From June 24 through July 29, Mota gave up no runs in 17 games ( [...] consecutive innings pitched). However, he had a 4.97 ERA over his next 13 games. On August 4, in a 17–4 victory over Milwaukee, Mota was ejected after he hit Brewers first baseman Prince Fielder with a pitch (in retaliation for Chris Smith hitting Manny Ramirez a few innings earlier, according to Dodgers catcher Russell Martin). After the game, Fielder attempted to gain entry into the Dodgers' clubhouse to confront Mota but was stopped by teammates. Both Mota and Fielder were fined by Major League Baseball for their actions. On August 31, Mota was placed on the disabled list with an <b>ingrown</b> <b>toenail</b> to make room for Ronnie Belliard on the roster. He was reactivated on September 14. However, after posting a 5.40 ERA in his final four games of the year, he was left off the Dodgers' playoff roster. He finished the season with a 3–4 record and a 3.44 ERA (his lowest since 2004) in 61 games. On November 6, he filed for free agency.|$|E
2500|$|Mild to {{moderate}} cases are often treated conservatively {{with warm water}} and epsom salt soaks, antibacterial ointment {{and the use of}} dental floss. If conservative treatment of a minor <b>ingrown</b> <b>toenail</b> does not succeed, or if the <b>ingrown</b> <b>toenail</b> is severe, surgical treatment may be required.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a {{rational}} treatment protocol according to basic surgical principles, anatomy of the nail bed, and etiological factors. <b>Ingrown</b> <b>toenails</b> have been discussed in medical literature for more than 1300 years. The condition commonly affects young adults and may result in significant morbidity in terms of loss of days from work, education, and recreation. The anatomy and physiology of the nail bed are presented to promote better selection of the proper management procedure. <b>Ingrown</b> <b>toenails</b> can be classified in terms of congenital or acquired causes. A surgical protocol, along with a description of each surgical technique, is supplied. The pathology of onychogryphosis is classified in terms of involvement of the germinal matrix, the sterile matrix, or both. Treatment is determined by the severity and underlying medical condition of the patient...|$|R
50|$|Surgical {{treatments}} of ingrown toenails include {{a number of}} different options. If conservative treatment of a minor <b>ingrown</b> <b>toenail</b> does not succeed or if the <b>ingrown</b> <b>toenail</b> is severe, surgical management is recommended by a podiatrist. The initial surgical approach is typically a partial avulsion of the nail plate known as a wedge resection or a complete removal of the toenail. If the <b>ingrown</b> <b>toenail</b> reoccurs despite this treatment, destruction of the germinal matrix with phenol is recommended. Antibiotics are not needed if surgery is performed.|$|E

25|$|One study {{compared}} {{patients with}} <b>ingrown</b> <b>toenails</b> to healthy controls {{and found no}} difference in the shape of toenails between those of patients and of the control group. The study suggested that treatment should not be based on the correction of a non-existent nail deformity. <b>Ingrown</b> <b>toenails</b> are caused by weight-bearing (activities such as walking, running, etc.) in patients that have too much soft skin tissue on the sides of their nail. Weight bearing causes this excessive amount of skin to bulge up along the sides of the nail. The pressure on the skin around the nail results in the tissue being damaged, resulting in swelling, redness and infection. Many treatments are directed at the nail itself and often include partial or full removal of the healthy nail. However, failure to treat the cutaneous condition can result in a return of the ingrowth and a deformity or mutilation of the nail.|$|R

In the past (and currently) the most common treatments are mainly directed at the nail (paradigm paralysis). Treatments often include part or full removal of the nail.

40|$|A new clinic {{was set up}} to {{deal with}} all toenail {{problems}} referred to a large general hospital. Ingrowing toenails were the commonest problem dealt with and phenol cauterization, either partial or complete, was the standard form of treatment.

40|$|Background: Partial nail {{avulsion}} with lateral chemical matricectomy is {{the treatment}} of choice for <b>ingrown</b> <b>toenails.</b> Phenol (88 %) is {{the most widely used}} chemical agent but prolonged postoperative drainage and collateral damage are common. Sodiumhydroxide (NaOH) 10 % has fewer side-effects. Methods: Adult, consenting patients with <b>ingrown</b> <b>toenails</b> were alternately allocated into two treatment groups in the order of their joining the study, to receive either 88 % phenol (Group 1, n = 26) or 10 % NaOH (Group 0, n = 23) chemical matricectomy. The patients as well as the statistician were blinded to the agent being used. Post-procedure follow-up evaluated median duration of pain, discharge, and healing along with recurrence, if any, in both the groups. The group wise data was statistically analyzed. Results: Both the groups responded well to treatment with the median duration of postoperative pain being 7. 92 days in Group 0 and 16. 25 days in Group 1 (P < 0. 202). Postoperative discharge continued for a median period of 15. 42 days (Group 0) and 18. 13 days (Group 1) (P < 0. 203). The tissue condition normalized in 7. 50 days (Group 0) and 15. 63 days (Group 1) (P < 0. 007). Limitations: Limited postsurgical follow up of 6 months is a limitation of the study. Conclusion: Chemical matricectomy using NaOH is as efficacious as phenolisation, with the advantage of faster tissue normalization...|$|R
40|$|For decades, {{every year}} sees a wide number of {{articles}} about treatment of <b>ingrown</b> <b>toenails.</b> There is still a debate about {{the cause of this}} painful condition. Surgical treatments rely on two main approaches: either narrowing the nail plate or debulking the soft tissues. It is up to the surgeon to select the most appropriate approach in each case. All procedures cited in this article have high cure rates {{as long as they are}} properly performed. As with all surgical procedures, they are operator dependent. Chemical cautery is the easiest and most versatile technique that may help in almost all instances for lateral ingrowing. For distal embedding and very hypertrophic and exuberant lateral folds, debulking with secondary intention healing is the most effective and easy to perform, with great results.
