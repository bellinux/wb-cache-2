50|$|Ear mites are mites {{that live}} in the ears of animals and humans. The most {{commonly}} seen species in veterinary medicine is Otodectes cynotis (Gk. oto=ear, dectes=biter, cynotis=of the dog). This species, despite its name, is also responsible for 90% of <b>ear</b> <b>mite</b> infections in cats.|$|E
50|$|The rabbit <b>ear</b> <b>mite,</b> Psoroptes cuniculi, {{is larger}} than Otodectes cynotis. It causes thick firm debris to form in the ear canal, and can {{eventually}} migrate to {{the skin of the}} outer ear and face. Symptoms include scratching and shaking of the head. Treatment includes topical selamectin, or injections of ivermectin and frequent cleanings of the rabbit's environment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ear</b> <b>mites</b> spread rapidly, {{and can be}} tansmitted {{from even}} brief {{physical}} contact with other animals. In pets, <b>ear</b> <b>mites</b> most commonly affect cats, ferrets, {{and to a lesser}} extent dogs. Humans can rarely be infected with <b>ear</b> <b>mites.</b> Infected animals have a large amount of crumbly dark brown material in their ears. On close inspection, tiny white mites can be seen in the debris. <b>Ear</b> <b>mites</b> do not burrow as some mites do, but live within the ear canal.|$|R
25|$|<b>Ear</b> <b>mites</b> {{and other}} mites can cause skin {{problems}} such as mange.|$|R
25|$|<b>Ear</b> <b>mites</b> are {{microscopic}} {{members of}} the species Otodectes cynotis. Symptoms include itching, inflammation, and black debris in the ear.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ear</b> <b>mite</b> is {{the most}} common cause of ear infections in cats, quickly {{spreading}} from one cat to another through direct contact. Ear mites cause inflammatory symptoms, similar to bacterial and yeast infections. Symptoms include itching and redness of the ears. Other, more serious problems can result from untreated infections, such as skin disease in areas other than the ear like the neck and tail, and deafness.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>ear</b> <b>mite</b> (as well as mange mite) {{treatments}} currently use the antiparasitics ivermectin and selamectin, usually as topical preparations. Ivermectin is {{available as a}} direct water-based liquid that is squeezed into the ear canal and massaged {{at the base of}} the ear to distribute the medication. Selamectin is available as a once-a-month preparation that can be applied to the animal's skin, which prevents mite infestation over that time.|$|E
50|$|In {{veterinary}} practice, <b>ear</b> <b>mite</b> {{infections in}} {{dogs and cats}} may present as a disease that causes intense itching in one or both ears, which in turn triggers scratching at the affected ear. An unusually dark colored ear wax (cerumen) may also be produced. Cats, as well as dogs with erect ears that have control over ear direction, may be seen with one or both ear pinnas held at an odd or flattened angle.|$|E
50|$|Selamectin (trade names Revolution, Stronghold) is {{a topical}} {{parasiticide}} and anthelminthic used on dogs and cats, distributed by Zoetis, a former Pfizer subsidiary. It treats and prevents infections of heartworms, fleas, <b>ear</b> <b>mites,</b> sarcoptic mange (scabies), and {{certain types of}} ticks in dogs, and prevents heartworms, fleas, <b>ear</b> <b>mites,</b> hookworms, and roundworms in cats. It also removes 2 types of lungworm in cats (Aelurostrongylus abstrusus, Eucoleus aerophilus) and one type of lungworm in dogs (Eucoleus aerophilus). It is structurally related to ivermectin and milbemycin. Selamectin is not approved for human use.|$|R
50|$|Among 289 live Basset Griffon Vendéens (both varieties) in the 2004 UKC survey, {{the most}} common health issues noted by owners were reproductive, {{dermatologic}} (dermatitis and mites), and aural (otitis externa, excessive ear wax, and <b>ear</b> <b>mites).</b>|$|R
40|$|A several {{number of}} mites have been {{associated}} with ear problems, namely otitis externa (Scott et al., 2001). Fifty percent or more of all otitis, in cats, and 10 %, in dogs, are thought to be caused by <b>ear</b> <b>mites</b> (Sotiraki et al., 2001; Mueller, 2008). Very common in pets, <b>ear</b> <b>mites</b> can be a serious problem. The most common mite is, undoubtedly, Otodectes cynotis, but there are some other mites that can also be found in the ear canal, includding Demodex canis, Demodex cati, Sarcoptes scabiei, Notoedres cati, among others (Cordero del Campillo et al., 1999; Blot et al., 2003; Engler, 2007). Frequently, <b>ear</b> <b>mites</b> can be the initiating factor of the otitis externa. The mechanical irritation, caused by their presence inside the ears, may lead to a higher activity of ceruminal glands and, consequently, the establishment of a favorable environment for secondary infections, caused by bacteria or fungi (August (1988) cited by Souza et al. (2008). These secondary infections and the animal’s individual response may perpetuate and induce the progression of the initial disease (Scott et al., 2001). It was established that the number of mites necessary to promote disease can be very low (only about two to three) triggering an Arthus-type and/or an immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction (Scott et al., 2001; Sotiraki et al., 2001; Angus, 2004). It has been reported that young animals tend to be more susceptible to <b>ear</b> <b>mites</b> than adult ones (Blot et al., 2003; Mueller, 2007; Mueller, 2008; Lefkaditis et al., 2009) ...|$|R
50|$|Topical 0.01% {{ivermectin}} in oil (Acarexx) {{has been}} reported to be effective in humans, and all mite infections in many types of animals (especially in <b>ear</b> <b>mite</b> infections where the animal cannot lick the treated area), and is so poorly absorbed that systemic toxicity is less likely in these sites. Nevertheless, topical ivermectin has not been well enough tested to be approved for this use in dogs, and is theoretically much more dangerous in zones where the animal can potentially lick the treated area. Selamectin applied to the skin (topically) has some of the same theoretical problems in collies and MDR1 dogs as ivermectin, but it has nevertheless been approved for use for all dogs provided that the animal can be observed for 8 hours after the first monthly treatment. Topical permethrin is also effective in both dogs and humans, but is toxic to cats.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} lesion {{associated}} with ear mites {{is an open}} or crusted ("scabbed") skin wound at the back or base of the ear, caused by abrasion of the skin by hind limb claws, as the ear has been scratched {{in an attempt to}} relieve the itching. This lesion often becomes secondarily infected and crusted from ordinary skin bacteria, so that the common presentation of ear mites is such a wound appearing on the back or base of one or both ears. This is accompanied by the Pinna-Pedal-Reflex that appears as reflex scratching motions of the hind limb when the ear is manipulated (this test is positive as well in other mite infections of the outside and rim of the ear pinnas in mange). When the <b>ear</b> <b>mite</b> infection is treated, such wounds resolve spontaneously, and this resolution may be speeded with application of topical antibiotics.|$|E
40|$|Otitis externa is a {{frequent}} finding in cats, with a prevalence rate of 2 - 10 % of all feline patients seen in general practice. Otodectes cyanotis, the <b>ear</b> <b>mite,</b> is responsible for approximately 50 % of all feline otitis externa cases. However, other infectious and inflammatory conditions frequently either cause or predispose the cat to ear disease. In 20 - 30 % of chronic feline ear cases the initiating cause remains unknown...|$|E
5000|$|Basset Hounds {{have large}} {{pendulous}} ears (known as [...] "leathers") {{that do not}} allow air to circulate inside them, unlike other breeds with erect or more open ears. This can result in infections and <b>ear</b> <b>mites</b> if their <b>ears</b> are not kept clean and dry.|$|R
50|$|The group {{contains}} {{many of the}} more notorious parasitic members of the Astigmata.

40|$|Ear mites (Otodectes cynotis) and {{ear canal}} tumors are highly {{prevalent}} among federally endangered Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis catalinae) living on Santa Catalina Island {{off the coast}} of Southern California. Since studies began in the 1990 s, nearly all foxes examined were found to be infected with ear mites, and ceruminous gland tumors (carcinomas and adenomas) were detected in approximately half of all foxes ≥ 4 years of age. We hypothesized that reduction of <b>ear</b> <b>mite</b> infection would reduce otitis externa and ceruminous gland hyperplasia, a risk factor for tumor development. In this study, we conducted a randomized field trial {{to assess the impact of}} acaricide treatment on <b>ear</b> <b>mite</b> prevalence and intensity of infection, otitis externa, ceruminous gland hyperplasia, and mite-specific IgG and IgE antibody levels. Treatment was highly effective at eliminating mites and reducing otitis externa and ceruminous gland hyperplasia, and mite-specific IgG antibody levels were significantly lower among uninfected foxes. Ceruminous gland hyperplasia increased in the chronically infected, untreated foxes during the six month study. Our results provide compelling evidence that acaricide treatment is an effective means of reducing ear mites, and that mite removal in turn reduces ear lesions and mite-specific IgG antibody levels in Santa Catalina Island foxes. This study has advanced our understanding of the underlying pathogenesis which results in ceruminous gland tumors, and has helped inform management decisions that impact species conservation...|$|E
40|$|A study {{based on}} {{naturally}} infested cats {{was designed to}} evaluate the effectiveness of a single treatment with a topical formulation containing fipronil, (S) -methoprene, eprinomectin and praziquantel, for the prevention of Otodectes cynotis infestation in cats. Six treated cats and six untreated cats were housed with three chronically Otodectes cynotis-infested cats, respectively. The cats of each group were kept together in a 20 -m 2 room for 1 month. Both clinical examination and <b>ear</b> <b>mite</b> counts were conducted on Day 28. All donor cats were confirmed to be chronically infested with Otodectes cynotis on Day − 1 and Day 28. From untreated control cats, 129 live mites were recovered on Day 28 and all cats were found to be infested. In the treated group, three cats were found to be infested, with a total of five live mites recovered, the difference between the two groups being significant (p =  0. 003). One treatment corresponded to 96 % preventive efficacy at Day 28 based on <b>ear</b> <b>mite</b> counts. With regard to cerumen, the clinical score increased significantly for untreated cats between Day − 1 and Day 28 (p =  0. 00026) and not for treated cats (p =  0. 30). The difference in cerumen abundance was significant between untreated and treated cats on Day 28 (p =  0. 0035). Concerning the pruritic reflex in at least one ear, all cats were negative at inclusion. All six untreated cats became positive and showed a reflex on Day 28, whereas no treated cat showed ear pruritus (p =  0. 00026) ...|$|E
5000|$|In mild cases, {{a product}} with anti-inflammatory, {{anti-fungal}} and anti-bacterial ingredients are often employed. In more severe cases, ear cleaning under sedation or anesthesia {{may be required}} and evaluation for otitis media may be indicated. Treatment for <b>ear</b> <b>mites</b> include <b>ear</b> drops that contain pyrethrins or an avermectin such as ivermectin or selamectin.|$|R
50|$|Infections {{are usually}} {{secondary}} to inflammation or to improper grooming techniques. Infections {{can be caused}} by both bacterial and fungal origin, as well as small organisms such as <b>ear</b> <b>mites.</b> Malassezia pachydermatis is a common fungal agent for ear infections in dogs. Staphylococcus intermedius is the most common bacterial infection. A more serious ear infection, with pus in the ear, may be caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.|$|R
50|$|Ear {{medications}} {{are applied}} after cleaning and drying, {{and is usually}} {{in the form of}} ear drops or ointment applied daily or twice daily for one or two weeks. The type of infection must be identified by the veterinarian by examining a sample of ear exudate under a microscope, since bacterial infection will only respond to antibiotics, fungal infection to a fungicide, and <b>ear</b> <b>mites</b> to an insecticide.|$|R
40|$|Parasitic otitis {{associated}} with Psoroptes sp. mites was diagnosed {{for the first}} time in two flocks of goats located in Tuscany, Italy. Some animals presented clinical signs of <b>ear</b> <b>mite</b> infection, but the parasites were also isolated from the ears of two clinically silent goats. A morphometric study was conducted to establish whether there are significant morphological differences between mites collected from the ears of goats and Psoroptes cuniculi collected from the ears of rabbits. Three rabbits were experimentally infected with mites isolated from the auditory canal of goats, while nine goats were infected with mites isolated from rabbits. After three to five months all rabbits and five of the nine goats contained reproducing mite populations in their ears; also the morphometric analysis revealed no difference between rabbit and goat ear mites. It follows that Psoroptes cuniculi represents the etiologic agent of parasitic otitis in both these two animal species...|$|E
40|$|When 400 micrograms ivermectin/kg was {{administered}} subcutaneously to rabbits {{infected with the}} <b>ear</b> <b>mite</b> Psoroptes cuniculi it significantly reduced the clinical score, and when 500 micrograms ivermectin/kg {{was administered}} subcutaneously to guinea pigs with mange due to Trixacaurus caviae it resulted in a clinical cure.

40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the prevalence, pathology, and epidemiology of tumors in free-ranging island foxes occurring on three islands in the California Channel Islands, USA. We found a remarkably high prevalence of ceruminous gland tumors in endangered foxes (Uro-cyon littoralis catalinae) occurring on Santa Catalina Island (SCA) — 48. 9 % of the dead foxes examined from 2001 – 2008 had tumors in their ears, and tumors were found in 52. 2 % of randomly-selected mature (4 years) foxes captured in 2007 – 2008, representing {{one of the highest}} prevalences of tumors ever documented in a wildlife population. In contrast, no tumors were detected in foxes from San Nicolas Island or San Clemente Island, although ear mites (Otodectes cynotis), a predisposing factor for ceruminous gland tumors in dogs and cats, were highly prevalent on all three islands. On SCA, otitis externa secondary to <b>ear</b> <b>mite</b> infection was highly correlated with ceruminous gland hyperplasia (CGH), and tumors were significantly associated with the severity of CGH, ceruminous gland dysplasia, and age group (older foxes).

40|$|Otodectes cynotis, <b>ear</b> <b>mite</b> or ear canker mite, is {{the most}} common cause of otitis externa in cats (approximately 50 %) and to a lesser extent in dogs, foxes and ferrets. The mite is living on the {{epidermal}} surface of auditory canal without burrowing into the tissue and feeding on tissue fluids and debris. In most of the cases they induce hypersensitiv­ity reactions in the host. Four puppies; Siberian husky, Cocker spaniel, Terrier and mixed Pekignese with different genders and ages were referred to the small animal hospital, Veterinary Faculty of Tehran University, Tehran, Iran for routine clinical examination just after they were imported from Thailand in a timeframe between June to August 2008. Clinical examinations showed an excessive dark brown discharge in both ears. No signs of other clinical situations were observed. White moving mites were seen during otoscopy examination. The specimen of ear discharge was sent to parasitology laboratory for precise identification of genus and species. Mites were identified as Otodectes cynotis and the presence of concurrent yeast and bacterial infection was showed by laboratory examinations.
