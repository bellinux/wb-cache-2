40|$|Abstract: Now a {{days the}} {{developing}} countries like India, where the population is over one billion, one-sixth of the world’s population, affects the natural & commercial resources. Mineral resources play very important role to back up or support the economy of country. <b>Iron</b> <b>ore</b> {{is one of the}} important mineral to increase the industrial development and country also. In the context of <b>Iron</b> <b>Ore,</b> it is necessary to locate its presence in nature using modern, time and cost saving technology. Different types of survey and techniques are applied to demarcate the <b>Iron</b> <b>ore</b> possibility areas like Bore hole and Field survey etc, which are the more costly and time consuming. In the modern age, remote sensing & GIS technique can reduce the cost and time of spatial survey. In the field of Remote sensing technique it is possible to identify the surface mineral distribution by using the spectral characteristic of mineral. For example the <b>Iron</b> <b>ore</b> absorb the 0. 85 - 0. 9 µm and strong reflectance at 0. 7 - 0. 75 µm region of Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR). In this present study of Noamundi <b>Iron</b> <b>ore</b> <b>mining</b> <b>areas</b> of Jharkhand, <b>Iron</b> <b>ore</b> distribution has carried out by using angular reflectance (θ Fe) hyper spectral image and correlation of spectral character and field Fe content. In the final result it is shown that the <b>Iron</b> <b>ore</b> distribution areas are 90 % match with known <b>Iron</b> <b>ore</b> <b>mining</b> <b>areas.</b> So it is possible to identify the <b>Iron</b> <b>ore</b> distribution without any field spectra but using only image spectra and Field Fe contents...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} development of any region involves some consequences to the environment. The choice of a socially optimal development plan must consider {{a measure of the}} strategy 2 ̆ 7 s environmental impact. This dissertation tackles this problem by examining environmental impacts of new production activities. The study uses the experience of the Carajás region in the north of Brazil. This region, which prior to the 19602 ̆ 7 s was an isolated outpost of the Amazon area, was integrated {{to the rest of the}} country with a non-sophisticated but strategic road system and eventually became the second largest <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> <b>mining</b> <b>area</b> in the world. Finally, in the 19802 ̆ 7 s, the area was linked, by way of a railroad, to the nearest seaport along the Atlantic Ocean. The consequence of such changes was a burst of economic growth along the railroad Corridor and neighboring areas. In this work, a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) is used to construct a 2 -region (Corridor and surrounding area), fixed price, Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Model to examine the relationship between production and pollution by measuring the different pollution effects of alternative growth strategies. SAMs are a very useful tool to examine the environmental impacts of development by linking production activities to measurable indices of natural resource degradation. The simulation results suggest that the strategies leading to faster economic growth in the short run are also those that lead to faster rates of environmental degradation. The simulations also show that the strategies that leads to faster rates of short run growth do so at the price of a rate of environmental depletion that is unsustainable from a long run perspective. These results, therefore, support the concern expressed by environmental economists and policy makers regarding the possible trade-offs between economic growth and environmental preservation. This stresses the need for a careful analysis of the environmental impacts of alternative growth strategies. ...|$|E

This type of ore contains various amounts of radionuclides; thus, exposing workers handling their extraction, transportation, and processing to radiation. Materials and Methods In this study, 12 ore samples (each mass weighing about 2 kg) were collected from the <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> <b>mining</b> <b>areas</b> of Arak region, Iran. The specific activities of 226 Ra, 232 Th, and 40 K were determined usinggamma-ray spectrometry method employing high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector.

ABSTRACT: This paper present the mapping of active <b>Iron</b> <b>ore</b> <b>mines</b> of Noamundi <b>areas</b> of Jharkhand. It was observed that the spectral characteristic of <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> lie in the NIR and SWIR region. The <b>Iron</b> <b>ore</b> absorbs the 0. 85 - 0. 9 µm, and shows strong reflectance at 0. 7 - 0. 75 µm region of Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR). The study involves hyperspectral image data, preprocessing like Noises are fixing bad and outlier pixels, local de-striping, atmospheric correction etc. and mines map generation by using NDII (Normalized Difference <b>Iron</b> <b>ore</b> Index) from the image. Atmospheric correction {{was carried out by}} using FLAASH algorithms applied on Hyperion image using the Hyperion tools available from ENVI 4. 7 [2]. The <b>Iron</b> <b>ore</b> <b>mines</b> are full of <b>Iron</b> <b>ore</b> or Fe dust material. So <b>Iron</b> <b>ore</b> has spectral signature due to own chemical component. In the case of <b>Iron</b> <b>ores,</b> the maximum reflectance Hematite shows near 0. 7 µm and maximum absorption shows near 0. 85 µm range of EMR [7].

5000|$|On Thursday 19 November 2009, {{rainfall}} of over 300 mm {{was recorded}} in Cumbria. The surge of water off the fells of the Lake District flowed back to the Irish Sea down the rivers of West Cumbria, including the River Derwent which caused flooding and damage at Keswick, Cockermouth and Workington. The River Ehen burst its banks at Cleator, near to the Kangol factory, flooding fields {{and a number of}} residential properties. Cleator Flood Action Group, associated to the National Flood Forum, was established following this event, in order to work with relevant agencies to progress actions to prevent or reduce the consequences of any future flood events. [...] Cleator was the site of a number of mills (originally linen). This was how Kangol came to be located at Cleator. Following the development of <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> <b>mining</b> in nearby <b>areas,</b> Cleator was site of associated works (hence the street name [...] "Kiln Brow" [...] and the location [...] "The Forge").

50|$|Frick has a {{very long}} {{inhabited}} history. At the nearby Wittnauer Horn, a prehistorical, late-Bronze Age fortification was discovered. The Roman era name for Frick (Ferraricia or <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> field) refers to the Roman <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> <b>mine</b> in the <b>area.</b> Additionally, remains of a Roman estate from the 2nd century {{were found on the}} main road, and the remains of a small fort from the early 4th century, which would have protected the military road Vindonissa-Augusta Raurica, was discovered below the church hill. On the hill, a new wall was built around 370. The finds in Oberdorf suggest a large Roman settlement from the 1st to 4th centuries. Graves on the church hill also indicate that there was an Alamanni settlement after the Romans. The core of the medieval settlement was clustered around the church hill. The oldest church, a fortified church building, is still visible around the current church. After the fire in the village in 1734 this old section was only partially rebuilt. The new settlement was concentrated along what is now the Bözbergstrasse. Frick is first mentioned in 1064 as Fricho.|$|R
5000|$|The harbor of Ashland was {{dominated}} by the massive Wisconsin Central Railway (later Soo Line) ore dock, built in 1916 to load <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> <b>mined</b> in the <b>area</b> into freighters bound for ports in the Rust Belt.

40|$|MSc (Occupational Hygiene), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> <b>mining</b> {{industry}} {{makes use}} of various processes that result in the release of airborne dust into the surrounding atmosphere where workers are exposed, to produce a final product. The deposition in the lung and toxicological influences of airborne dust can be determined by their physical- and chemical characteristics. The Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) regulations for hazardous chemical substances have no current system of how the physical- and chemical properties of particulates originating from specific areas will influence a worker‘s exposure and health, especially for ultrafine particles (UFP). It is therefore imperative to characterise airborne dust containing micrometer and UFP size particles originating from specific areas {{to determine if there}} are physical- and chemical characteristics {{that may or may not}} have an influence on the workers‘ health. Aim: This pilot study is aimed at the physical- and chemical characterisation of the airborne <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> dust generated at the process areas of an opencast <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> <b>mine.</b> Method: Sampled <b>areas</b> included the Primary-secondary crusher, Tertiary crusher, Quaternary crusher and Sifting house. Gravimetric sampling was conducted through the use of static inhalable- and respirable samplers in conjunction with optical- and condensation particle counters that were placed near airborne dust- emitting sources. Physical- and chemical characterisation was done with the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Results: The results found in the study indicate high mass concentration levels of inhalable dust at all four process areas, as well as high levels of respirable dust found at the primary- secondary crusher area. Particle size distribution optical particle counter (OPC) results indicate that the majority of particles at all four process areas are in the region of 0. 3 μm in size. Condensation particle counter (CPC) results integrated with OPC results indicate that at the primarysecondary and Tertiary crushers the majority of particles are found to be in the size fraction < 0. 3 μm. SEM analysis indicates that particle agglomeration largely occurs in the airborne <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> dust. Particle splinters originating from larger particle collisions and breakages are present in the airborne dust. EDS analysis indicates that the elemental majority of the airborne <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> dust consists of iron, oxygen, carbon, aluminium, silicon, potassium and calcium. The elemental percentages differ from each process area where an increase in iron and decrease in impurities can be seen as the ore moves through the beneficiation process from the Primary-secondary crusher to the Sifting house. Conclusion: The results obtained from the physical- and chemical properties of the airborne <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> dust indicate high risk of over-exposure to the respiratory system, as well as possible ultrafine particle systemic exposure, that may overwhelm the physiological defense mechanisms of the human body and lead to reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and the development of pathologies such as siderosis, silicasiderosis and lung cancer.
