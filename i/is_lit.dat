5|$|Internally, {{a number}} of rooms feature period wall and ceiling decorations {{including}} the entrance hall, which dates from the original 1730s building and features moulded panelling and cornices, a marble fireplace and ornamental plaster ceiling and an arabesque frieze. The stairwell <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> from above with a roof light and features a cantilevered stair with iron balusters from the 1825 adaptation with a later brass handrail.|$|E
5|$|The Lee Dining Room is {{used for}} formal banquets. It <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> by an 1825 Irish crystal chandelier. One hundred place {{settings}} of fine china and 150 place settings of sterling silver flatware were acquired from Tiffany & Co. in 1988 {{for use in the}} dining room.|$|E
5|$|An older feast, {{held by the}} {{fishermen}} {{towards the end of}} December, included a pie cooked with different fish to represent the variety of catches the men hoped to achieve in the coming year. There is a possibility that Tom Bawcock's Eve is an evolution of this festival. Since 1963, the festival has been run {{against the backdrop of the}} Mousehole village illuminations, where the entire harbour <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> up, along with many other displays. One set of lights even represents the pie itself, showing fish heads and tails protruding from a pie dish underneath six stars.|$|E
50|$|In {{almost all}} Hindu homes, lamps <b>are</b> <b>lit</b> daily, {{sometimes}} before an altar. In some houses, oil lamps or candles <b>are</b> <b>lit</b> at dawn, in some houses they <b>are</b> <b>lit</b> at both dawn and dusk, {{and in a}} few, lamps are maintained continuously.|$|R
5000|$|It <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> {{to honor}} the fallen Israeli Athletes from the 1972 Munich Olympics Games.It <b>was</b> also <b>lit</b> for several days {{following}} the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986. The torch <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> for over a week following the September 11 attacks in 2001. In 2004, the cauldron <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> non-stop for seven days in tribute to president Ronald Reagan, who had died. It <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> again in April 2005 {{following the death of}} Pope John Paul II, who had celebrated Mass at the Coliseum during his visit to Los Angeles in 1987. At the Los Angeles Dodgers 50th anniversary game on March 29, 2008, the torch <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> for the ThinkCure! charity ceremony, while Neil Diamond's [...] "Heartlight" [...] was played and the majority of the attendees turned on their complimentary souvenir keychain flashlights. It <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> for the duration of Special Olympics World Games held in Los Angeles from July 25, 2015 to August 2, 2015. The cauldron <b>was</b> most recently <b>lit</b> for the returning Los Angeles Rams' first home game on September 18, 2016 against the Seattle Seahawks.|$|R
5000|$|In Northern Ireland, bonfires <b>are</b> <b>lit</b> on Halloween, October 31. {{and each}} 11 July, bonfires <b>are</b> <b>lit</b> by many Protestant {{communities}} {{to celebrate the}} victory of Williamite forces at the Battle of the Boyne, which took place on 12 July 1690. This is often called the [...] "Eleventh night". Bonfires have also <b>been</b> <b>lit</b> by Catholic communities on 9 August since 1972 to protest and commemorate Internment.|$|R
5|$|Bath Abbey was a Norman church {{built on}} earlier foundations. The present {{building}} {{dates from the}} early 16th century and shows a late Perpendicular style with flying buttresses and crocketed pinnacles decorating a crenellated and pierced parapet. The choir and transepts have a fan vault by Robert and William Vertue. A matching vault {{was added to the}} nave in the 19th century. The building <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> by 52 windows.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the College Walk festivities {{is one of}} Columbia's older holiday traditions, the lighting of the Yule Log. The Christmas ceremony dates to a period prior to the American Revolutionary War, but lapsed before being revived by University President Nicholas Murray Butler in the early 20th century. A troop of students dressed as Continental Army soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sun-dial to the lounge of John Jay Hall, where it <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> amid the singing of seasonal carols. The Christmas ceremony {{is accompanied by a}} reading of A Visit From St. Nicholas by Clement Clarke Moore and Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus by Francis Pharcellus Church.|$|E
5|$|Large {{pieces of}} glass screens and metal {{shoulder}} eaves extend horizontally; the station <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> and transparent. The specially designed lighting, the clear tempered glass, the insulating glass, and the truss system emphasize {{the functions of}} the space and bring a bright look to the building. The 6-meter tall lobby on the ground floor is connected by the escalators coming up from the entrance hall and the platforms built underground.|$|E
5000|$|Ufa has two eternal flames. The first <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> in 1980 in Victory Park, honouring Alexander Matrosov and Minnigali Gubaidullin. The second <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> in 1967, honouring soldiers, {{who fell}} {{fighting}} for the Soviet Union.|$|R
50|$|If {{none of the}} forges <b>were</b> <b>lit</b> {{during the}} second section, the team must {{retrieve}} a key from the mine cart, full of rocks, to unlock a cage and ring a bell, which causes the smallest forge to <b>be</b> <b>lit.</b>|$|R
50|$|The tower {{changes its}} {{lighting}} scheme on holidays and to commemorate major events. After the 95th Grey Cup in Toronto, the tower <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> up in {{green and white}} to represent the colours of the Grey Cup champion Saskatchewan Roughriders. From sundown on August 27, 2011, to sunrise the following day, the tower <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> in orange, the official colour of the New Democratic Party (NDP), to commemorate the death of federal NDP leader {{and leader of the}} official opposition Jack Layton. When former South African president Nelson Mandela died, the tower <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> up in the colours of the South African flag. When former federal finance minister under Stephen Harper's Conservatives Jim Flaherty died, the tower <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> in green to reflect his Irish Canadian heritage. On the night of the attacks on Paris on November 13, 2015, the CN Tower <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> up in the colours of the French flag.|$|R
5|$|Months {{before each}} Games, the Olympic Flame <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> in Olympia in a {{ceremony}} that reflects ancient Greek rituals. A female performer, acting as a priestess, ignites a torch by placing it inside a parabolic mirror which focuses the sun's rays; she then lights the torch of the first relay bearer, thus initiating the Olympic torch relay that will carry the flame to the host city's Olympic stadium, where it {{plays an important role}} in the opening ceremony. Though the flame has been an Olympic symbol since 1928, the torch relay was only introduced at the 1936 Summer Games to promote the Third Reich.|$|E
5|$|St Peter's {{is made up}} {{of three}} parts, {{including}} a mid-19th-century west tower, which replaced the original in 1859–60 after it fell down. The perpendicular clerestory is decorated with shields in quatrefoils and <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> with closely set three-light windows. The tall decorated chancel has very large windows. The side windows have reticulated tracery. The large east window was partly rebuilt in 1875–76, and is composed of six lights with two large mouchettes nodding to each other, as well as a very large reticulation unit.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} festival of the Annamalaiyar temple is celebrated during the Tamil month of Karthikai, between November and December, concluding with {{the celebration of}} Karthikai Deepam. A huge lamp <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> in a cauldron, containing three tons of ghee, {{at the top of}} the Annamalai hills during the Deepam. To mark the occasion, the festival deity of Annamalaiyar circumambulates the mountain. Inscriptions indicate that the festival was celebrated as early as the Chola period (850–1280) and was expanded to ten days in the twentieth century.|$|E
5000|$|The Olympic flame {{cauldron}} <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> by {{a flaming}} arrow, shot by Paralympic archer Antonio Rebollo. The arrow had <b>been</b> <b>lit</b> by {{the flame of}} the Olympic Torch. Rebollo overshot the cauldron as this was the original design of the lighting scheme.|$|R
3000|$|... {{i belong}} to the same segment of the {{exposure}} interval. The time mismatch causes visual artifacts. Samples should <b>be</b> <b>lit</b> <b>are</b> shadowed or samples should <b>be</b> shadowed <b>are</b> <b>lit.</b> Additionally, rendered images have self-shadow artifacts at low sampling rates when geometries move toward the light. Later, this idea is implemented in the current GPUs by McGuire et al. [9].|$|R
50|$|Given {{the photo}} of the clock {{at the top of the}} article as an example, two fields <b>are</b> <b>lit</b> in the first row (five hours multiplied by two, i.e. ten hours), but no fields <b>are</b> <b>lit</b> in the second row; {{therefore}} the hour value is 10. Six fields <b>are</b> <b>lit</b> in the third row (five minutes multiplied by six, i.e. thirty minutes), while the bottom row has one field on (plus one minute). Hence, the lights of the clock altogether tell the time as 10:31.|$|R
5|$|The oblique roof {{covering}} the eastern {{facade of the}} Chiayi Station features a high-tech image. The generator room is decorated with horizontal shutters that reflect a minimalist style. The columns and truss system in the station imitate trees; as they extend toward {{the outside of the}} building, the artificial elements are integrated into nature. When night falls, the ceiling <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> with thousands of lights over the truss system, resembling a starry night over the branches of a forest.|$|E
5|$|The same {{cauldron}} {{was used}} as in the 1932 Summer Games. The orchestra played The Olympian composed and conducted by Philip Glass. The torch enters the stadium carried by Rafer Johnson, he completes a lap as mechanical steps rise {{from the center of}} the peristalses. He climbs the stairs and stands and faces the crowd as The Olympian is still being played. After a minute, he lights the gas powered Olympic rings that connect with the Olympic cauldron. The flame <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> to the cheers from the crowd. The athlete and judges oaths are taken and a children's chorus appears. They perform ode to joy.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} terraced {{into the side}} of a mound, so the {{northern}} side of the basement is partially below ground level. As was typical of most keeps, the bottom floor was an undercroft used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18thcentury when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts. The basement <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> through small slits.|$|E

50|$|The {{output of}} this device is a boxcar output where the photodiodes <b>are</b> {{sequentially}} <b>lit</b> diode-by-diode {{as the object}} distance changes {{in relation to the}} sensor, until either no diodes <b>are</b> <b>lit</b> or all diodes <b>are</b> <b>lit.</b> The residual product charge dynamic value in each light diode cell {{is a function of the}} bias current, the dark current and the incident ionizing radiation (in this case, the returning laser light).|$|R
5000|$|All {{six were}} built between 1855 and 1859 and all <b>were</b> <b>lit</b> by 1859; {{for the most}} part, their {{construction}} was simultaneous and the design virtually identical, although the Christian Island Light is not as tall as the others. Cove Island {{was the first to}} <b>be</b> <b>lit,</b> on October 30, 1858; construction on Christian Island was the first to be started but this Light was the last to <b>be</b> <b>lit,</b> on May 1, 1859. (The projects cancelled were to be at White Fish Island, Mississagi Strait, Isle St. Joseph, Clapperton Island and Badgley Island.) ...|$|R
5|$|The two {{then follow}} a small {{path through the}} woods until they come to {{a house with a}} stake fence around it. The house is {{described}} as beautiful, featuring carvings filled with gold and silver. They enter the house with a few men, and find that it <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> from glass windows in the ceiling, so that the daylight illuminates the room and there are no shadows to be seen due to this. There were depictions of many gods there and a woman who is described as well dressed near the door.|$|E
5|$|Vent: A thin tube on {{the near}} end of the cannon {{connecting}} the explosive charge inside with an ignition source outside and often filled with a length of fuse; always located near the breech. Sometimes called the fuse hole or the touch hole. On {{the top of the}} vent {{on the outside of the}} cannon is a flat circular space called the vent field where the charge <b>is</b> <b>lit.</b> If the cannon is bronze, it will often have a vent piece made of copper screwed into the length of the vent.|$|E
5|$|Depth and {{dimension}} are rendered {{by the use}} {{of linear}} perspective, by the overlapping of the layers of shapes, and in particular, as stated by Clark, through the use of tone. This compositional element operates within the picture in a number of ways. First, there is the appearance of natural light within the painted room and beyond it. The pictorial space in the midground and foreground <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> from two sources: by thin shafts of light from the open door, and by broad streams coming through the window to the right. The 20th-century French philosopher and cultural critic Michel Foucault observed that the light from the window illuminates both the studio foreground and the unrepresented area in front of it, in which the king, the queen, and the viewer are presumed to be situated. For José Ortega y Gasset, light divides the scene into three distinct parts, with foreground and background planes strongly illuminated, between which a darkened intermediate space includes silhouetted figures.|$|E

50|$|The {{mill and}} village houses <b>were</b> {{originally}} <b>lit</b> by candles and oil lamps but in 1813, Deanston Mill <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> by gas - {{said to be}} the first gasworks in the west of Scotland and ahead of Westminster Bridge, which <b>was</b> not <b>lit</b> until the end of December that year.|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} evaluated rate {{dependency and}} a neuropharmacological model of timing as {{explanations of the}} effects of amphetamine on behavior under discriminative control by time. Four pigeons pecked keys during 60 -trial sessions. On each trial, the houselight <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> for a particular duration (5 to 30 s), and then the key <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> for 30 s. In Experiment 1, the key could <b>be</b> <b>lit</b> either green or blue. If the key <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> green and the sample was 30 s, or if the key <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> blue and the sample was 5 s, pecks produced food on a variable-interval 20 -s schedule. The rate of key pecking increased as a function of sample duration when the key was green and decreased as a function of sample duration when the key was blue. Acute d-amphetamine (0. 1 to 3. 0 mg/kg) decreased higher rates of key pecking and increased lower rates of key pecking as predicted by rate dependency, but did not shift the timing functions leftward (toward overestimation) as predicted by the neuropharmacological model. These results were replicated in Experiment 2, in which the key <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> only one color during sessions, indicating that the effects were not likely due to disruption of discriminative control by key color. These results are thus consistent with rate dependency but not with the predictions of the neuropharmacological model...|$|R
5|$|Dover's Hill {{was bought}} by the National Trust in 1928, and until {{recently}} contained a monument to Robert Dover. The Games were revived for the 1951 Festival of Britain, but {{did not return to}} being a regular event until the Robert Dover's Games Society was founded in 1965. Except when exceptionally bad weather or an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease has forced their cancellation the Games have been held each year since 1966, on the evening of the Friday after Spring Bank Holiday, and attract thousands of visitors. An actor dressed as Dover arrives on horseback to open the games. Events have included the tug of war, gymkhana, shin-kicking, dwile flonking, motorcycle scrambling, judo, piano smashing, morris dancing, and, in 1976, poetry. After dusk a bonfire <b>is</b> <b>lit,</b> followed by a torchlight procession to the square in Chipping Campden, where the entertainment continues well into the night.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Halifax sent a Christmas tree to the City of Boston in {{thanks and}} remembrance {{for the help}} that the Boston Red Cross and the Massachusetts Public Safety Committee {{provided}} immediately after the disaster. That gift was revived in 1971 by the Lunenburg County Christmas Tree Producers Association, which began an annual donation of a large tree to promote Christmas tree exports as well as acknowledge Boston's support after the explosion. The gift was later {{taken over by the}} Nova Scotia Government to continue the goodwill gesture as well as to promote trade and tourism. The tree is Boston's official Christmas tree and <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> on Boston Common throughout the holiday season. In deference to its symbolic importance for both cities, the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources has specific guidelines for selecting the tree.|$|E
5|$|Qwak! was {{released}} in a standard upright arcade cabinet with {{a black and white}} raster television monitor inset, with the rifle holster and start button below as the only controls. The reeds and tree branch overlay is screen printed in color onto a clear panel in front of the monitor, and is backlit by the screen; the screen <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> with a gray background instead of a black one in order to produce this effect. When the gun is triggered, the duck additionally flashes white briefly, so as to be detected by the light gun; the relative brightness of the screen makes this effect less obvious than with other similar light gun games. Qwak! was not the first light gun video game; it was preceded by the arcade game Balloon Gun (August 1974) and a light gun game for the Magnavox Odyssey video game console (1972), as well as non-video game light gun games since the 1936 Seeberg Ray-O-Lite.|$|E
