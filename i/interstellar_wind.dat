Near the boundary between the solar system and the interstellar medium we find that an unstable ``jet-sheet'' forms. The jet-sheet oscillates up and down due to a velocity shear instability. This result is due to a novel application of a state-of-art 3 D Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code with a highly refined grid. We assume as a first approximation that the solar magnetic and rotation axes are aligned. The effect of a tilt of the magnetic axis with respect to the rotation axis remains to be seen.

40|$|Launched in 1977 on {{a journey}} to the giant outer planets and beyond, Voyager 1 and 2 have {{explored}} the spatial and dynamical properties of the heliosphere that modulates the inward flow of galactic cosmic rays and {{is the source of}} anomalous cosmic rays. The two spacecraft are in the heliosheath beyond the termination shock where the supersonic solar wind has slowed as it approaches the boundary of the heliosphere. The shock crossing was 10 AU closer at Voyager 2 in the south than at Voyager 1 in the north, indicating a local interstellar magnetic field pressing inward more strongly on the southern hemisphere. The expected source of anomalous cosmic rays was not observed at the shock, and their intensity has increased deeper in the heliosheath, indicating the source is elsewhere on the shock or in the heliosheath. Voyager 1, now at 121 AU at 35 degrees north, has been in a quasi-stagnation region since 2010 where there is no outward motion of the wind, the magnetic field is enhanced, and the galactic cosmic ray intensity is increasing. In contrast, the heliosheath flow at Voyager 2 at 99 AU and 30 degrees south is faster and increasingly deflected in a non-radial direction as it turns to flow tailward.

40|$|High-resolution {{mid-infrared}} observations {{carried out}} by the Spitzer Space Telescope allowed one to resolve the fine structure of many astrospheres. In particular, they showed that the astrosphere around the B 0. 7 Ia star kappa Cas (HD 2905) has a clear-cut arc structure with numerous cirrus-like filaments beyond it. Previously, we suggested a physical mechanism for the formation of such filamentary structures. Namely, we showed theoretically that they might represent the non-monotonic spatial distribution of the interstellar dust in astrospheres (viewed as filaments) caused by interaction of the dust grains with the interstellar magnetic field disturbed in the astrosphere due to colliding of the stellar and <b>interstellar</b> <b>winds.</b> In this paper, we invoke this mechanism to explain the structure of the astrosphere around kappa Cas. We performed 3 D magnetohydrodynamic modelling of the astrosphere for realistic parameters of the stellar wind and space velocity. The dust dynamics and the density distribution in the astrosphere were calculated in the framework of a kinetic model. It is found that the model results with the classical MRN size distribution of dust in the interstellar medium do not match the observations, and that the observed filamentary structure of the astrosphere can be reproduced only if the dust is composed mainly of big (micron-sized) grains. Comparison of the model results with observations allowed us to estimate parameters (number density and magnetic field strength) of the surrounding interstellar medium.

The CO(1 – 0) subsample was selected from SPOGs detected by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with 22 μm flux detected {{at a signal-to-noise ratio}} (S/N) > 3. Of the 52 objects observed in CO(1 – 0), 47 are detected with S/N > 3. A large fraction (37 %– 46 % ± 7 %) of our CO-SPOG sample were visually classified as morphologically disrupted. The H 2 masses detected were between 10 ^(8. 7 - 10. 8) M_☉, consistent with the gas masses found in normal galaxies, though approximately an order of magnitude larger than the range seen in poststarburst galaxies. When comparing the 22 μm and CO(1 – 0) fluxes, SPOGs diverge from the normal star-forming relation, having 22 μm fluxes in excess of the relation by a factor of 〈є_(MIR) rangle = 4. 91 _(- 0. 39) ^(+ 0. 42), suggestive of the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs).

40|$|International audienceUVS {{instrument}} onboard Voyager- 1 {{has been}} performing {{measurements of the}} backscattered solar Lyman-alpha emissions for more than 35 years. Since 2003 when the scan platform movements were stopped, it measures Lyman-alpha radiation in one line of sight close to the upwind direction. The most interesting feature of these data is radial dependence of measured intensity. Namely, Voyager- 1 data shows almost constant intensity (after correction for the solar flux variations) between 90 and 115 AU, while the numerical models of global heliosphere and radiative transfer predict decreasing intensity. Between 115 AU (beginning of 2011) and about 124 AU (beginning of 2013), the data show a decrease of the intensity again. This last period corresponds to motion of Voyager- 1 in the transition region (Krimigis et al., 2011) before crossing the heliopause at 122 AU in August, 2012 (Stone et al., 2013). This behavior of the Lyman-alpha intensity observed by Voyager can be a tracer of complicated structure of the heliospheric boundary. Plasma instruments onboard Voyagers provide information about charged component of the solar and <b>interstellar</b> <b>winds</b> and energetic particles, while only the UVS data for the Lyman-alpha intensity reflect {{the distribution of the}} neutral hydrogen component.

40|$|Since its {{formation}} 4. 6 {{billion years}} ago, {{our solar system}} has most likely crossed numerous magnetized interstellar clouds and bubbles of different sizes and contents on its path through the Milky Way. Having a reference model for how the heliosphere and <b>interstellar</b> <b>winds</b> interact is critical for understanding our current Galactic environment, and it requires untangling the roles of two major actors: the time-variable solar wind and the local interstellar magnetic field. Numerical simulations predict a distortion of the heliosphere caused by both solar <b>wind</b> anisotropy and <b>interstellar</b> magnetic field orientation. However, model comparison to deep space probes' measurements led to contradictory reports by Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 of both several crossings of the solar wind's termination shock and {{of the strength of}} the local interstellar field, with values ranging from 1. 8 to 5. 7 μG. Here, we show that Voyager 1 & 2 plasma, fields, and Lyman-α sky background measurements, as well as space observations of high-energy particles of heliospheric origin, may all be explained by a rather weak interstellar field 2. 2 +/- 0. 1 μG pointing from Galactic coordinates (l,b) ∼ (28, 52) +/- 3. For the 2000 epoch Ulysses-based helium parameters assumed thus far, the interstellar bow shock must exist. By contrast, using the 2010 epoch IBEX-based He parameters and a stronger magnetic field leads to a plasma configuration that is not consistent with the Voyagers TS crossings. For the newly proposed interstellar He parameters, more simulations are required before one may determine whether the interstellar bow shock truly does disappear under those assumptions.

Over this time period they find an average H Ly-alpha brightness of 1260 R which they estimate is composed of 200 R of solar scattered radiation and 1060 R from a collisional source. A third component, not considered by previous authors, is the reflection of H Ly-alpha emissions from the <b>interstellar</b> <b>wind.</b> Hydrogen in the <b>interstellar</b> <b>wind</b> forms an extended source of H Ly-alpha whose importance relative to the solar flux increases with distance from the sun. The present paper demonstrates that scattering of interstellar H Ly-alpha is more important than scattering of solar H Ly-alpha for reasonable values of H column abundance and, in fact, may make up 10 - 40 percent of the observed signal. Large H column abundances are still required to explain the H Ly-alpha brightness solely on the basis of resonant scattering; therefore it is likely that the emissions are due in part to collisional sources and in part to the scattering of interstellar H Ly-alpha with solar scattering playing a minor role...|$|E
