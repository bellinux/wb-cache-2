500|$|Many {{economists and}} world governments {{determined}} that the situation became the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according to former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. Bush, meanwhile, proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back {{a large portion of}} the U.S. mortgage market. Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute, said [...] "it would have helped <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely", and additionally, that it would have helped [...] "for Congress to have held hearings".|$|E

2500|$|In 1994, {{reviewing}} Robb Forman Dew's book The Family Heart: A Memoir of When Our Son Came Out, Bawer {{praised the}} book but added: “To be gay is to yearn {{for a time}} when it won't be necessary for mothers to write sensitive books about their children's coming out.” Reviewing a book by Urvashi Vaid in 1995, Bawer argued that “while more and more gay people” were seeking a gay-rights movement focused on “integration, education and conciliation,” Vaid wished “to return to the day of class struggle and liberation fronts.” The fact that “her rhetoric has come to seem so old so fast,” he concluded, “is a measure of how gay political discourse outside the academy, anyway—has been profoundly altered in a relatively brief time.” Bawer called for same-sex marriage in a March 1996 op-ed. In June 1997, he expressed concern that so-called “morning-after” treatments for possible HIV infection could result in “increased carelessness” by at-risk individuals. In January 2001, he called <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> “to take substantive action on behalf of gays,” noting that the U.S. government was “now lagging behind the American people on gay issues.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The George W. Bush {{administration}} also voiced {{support for an}} adaptation-only policy in the US in 2002. [...] "In a stark shift <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration,</b> the United States has sent a climate report [...] to the United Nations detailing specific and far-reaching effects it says global warming will inflict on the American environment. In the report, the {{administration also}} {{for the first time}} places most of the blame for recent global warming on human actions—mainly the burning of fossil fuels that send heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere." [...] The report however [...] "does not propose any major shift in the administration's policy on greenhouse gases. Instead it recommends adapting to inevitable changes instead of making rapid and drastic reductions in greenhouse gases to limit warming." [...] This position apparently precipitated a similar shift in emphasis at the COP 8 climate talks in New Delhi several months later, [...] "The shift satisfies the Bush administration, which has fought to avoid mandatory cuts in emissions for fear it would harm the economy. 'We're welcoming a focus on more of a balance on adaptation versus mitigation', said a senior American negotiator in New Delhi. 'You don't have enough money to do everything.'" [...] The White House emphasis on adaptation was not well received however: ...|$|E
