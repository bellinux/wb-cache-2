500|$|In 1986, Signithia Fordham co-authored with Nigerian {{sociologist}} John Ogbu a {{study that}} concluded that high-performing African-American students in a Washington, D.C., high school borrowed from hegemonic white culture {{as part of a}} strategy for achievement, while struggling to maintain a black identity. Ogbu made a related claim in his 2003 book, Black American Students in an Affluent Suburb: A Study of Academic Disengagement, concluding that black students' own cultural attitudes sometimes hindered academic achievement and that these attitudes are too often neglected. Ogbu had earlier written in his seminal work Minority Education and Caste (1978), that school disengagement among caste-like minorities occurs because white society limits the job-success of their parents and others in their communities by a glass ceiling. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>book,</b> he said that non-whites [...] "failed to observe the link between educational achievement and access to jobs." ...|$|E
500|$|After Nansen died on 13 May 1930, Quisling {{used his}} {{friendship}} with {{the editor of the}} Tidens Tegn newspaper to get his analysis of Nansen onto the front page. The article was entitled [...] "Politiske tanker ved Fridtjof Nansens død" [...] ("Political Thoughts on the Death of Fridtjof Nansen") and was published on 24 May. In the article, he outlined ten points that would complete Nansen's vision as applied to Norway, among them [...] "strong and just government" [...] and a [...] "greater emphasis on race and heredity." [...] This theme was followed up <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>book,</b> Russia and Ourselves (...) , which was serialised in Tidens Tegn during the autumn of 1930. Advocating war against Bolshevism, the openly racist book catapulted Quisling into the political limelight. Despite his earlier ambivalence, he took up a seat on the Oslo board of the previously Nansen-led Fatherland League. Meanwhile, he and Prytz founded a new political movement, Nordisk folkereisning i Norge, or [...] "Nordic popular rising in Norway," [...] with a central committee of 31 and Quisling as its fører – a one-man executive committee – though Quisling seemed to have had no particular attachment to the term. The first meeting of the league took place on 17 March 1931, stating the purpose of the movement was to [...] "eliminate the imported and depraved communist insurgency." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hosking's work at Abney Park won {{important}} admirers, {{as well as}} critics. Its {{combination of}} an architectural design approach, academically researched in every detail, conceptual empathy for the non-denominational idea, and educational landscape complete with arboretum, presented the environs of London with a challenging standard for future landscape and building design. In 1840, in recognition of Hosking's contribution {{to the advancement of}} architectural practice, he was offered the first Professorship of King's College in the [...] "Art of Construction", soon renamed [...] "Principles and Practice of Architecture", to better reflect this relatively new profession and its emergence as an academic discipline. Hosking's educational approach was set out <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> of the same title, Principles and Practice of Architecture (1842). His appointment by King's College was something of a coup for those with liberal, non-denominational empathies, since the university was founded as a high church riposte against the [...] "ungodly" [...] UCL with its non-denominational entry requirements. King's was only brought slowly out of this backward-looking denominational approach that gradually came to be perceived as belonging to a bygone age.|$|E

5000|$|In 2002, British author Pete Davies wrote American Road: The Story of an Epic Transcontinental Journey at the Dawn of the Motor Age, {{about the}} 1919 Army Convoy on the Lincoln Highway. About the book, Publishers Weekly said: <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>newest</b> <b>book,</b> Davies (Inside the Hurricane; The Devil's Flu) offers a play-by-play {{account of the}} 1919 {{cross-country}} military caravan that doubled as a campaign for the Lincoln Highway.

Using {{the progress of the}} caravan and the metaphor of paving toward the future versus stagnating in the mud, Davies touches on the industrial and social factors that developed the small and mid-sized towns that line the highways and byways of the nation.|$|R
