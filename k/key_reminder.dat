Introduced at a base price of Rs. 3.06 Lakh, the next gen Alto K10 comes with multiple exterior and interiors updates, however mechanically it remains same. The car is a somewhat upgraded version of the Alto 800 with a new front fascia comprising a new chrome fitted front grille, new swept back headlamps, and a redesigned bonnet line. There are also amendments for tail lights, restructuring of bumpers, 13 inch wheels, ORVMs, door moulding and some other minor modifications. Interiors too have been updated, with a new dashboard, three-spoke steering wheel, refined upholstery, black finished music system and a better looking instrument cluster. Other added features inside the car include front power windows, 12 V power socket, internally adjustable ORVMs, headlamp warning buzzer, <b>key</b> off <b>reminder</b> and gearshift indicator.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Efforts to {{increase}} blood pressure (BP) control rates in blacks, a traditionally underserved high-risk population must address both provider practice and patient adherence issues. The home-based BP Intervention for blacks {{study is a}} 3 -arm randomized controlled trial designed to test 2 strategies to improve hypertension management and outcomes in a decentralized service setting serving a vulnerable and complex home care population. The primary study outcomes are systolic BP, diastolic BP, and BP control; secondary outcomes are nurse adherence to hypertension management recommendations and patient adherence to medication, healthy diet, and other self-management strategies. Nurses (n 312) in a nonprofit Medicare-certified home health agency are randomized along with their eligible hypertensive patients (n 845). The 2 interventions being tested are (1) a “basic ” intervention delivering <b>key</b> evidence-based <b>reminders</b> to home care nurses and patients while the patient is receiving traditional postacute home health care; and (2) an “augmented ” intervention that includes that same as the basic intervention, plus transition to an ongoing Hypertension Home Support Program that extends support for 12 months. Outcomes are measured at 3 and 12 months after baseline interview. The interventions will be assessed relative to usual care and to each other. Systems change to improve BP management and outcomes in home health will not easily occur without new intervention models and rigorous evaluation of their impact. Results from this trial will provide important information on potential strategies to improve BP control in a low-income chronically ill patient population.

40|$|Poor {{medication}} adherence {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of illness and of treatment failure in the United States. The objective of this study was to conduct an initial evaluation of a context-aware reminder system, which generated reminders at an opportune time to take the medication. Ten participants aged 65 or older, living alone and managing their own medications, participated in the study. Participants took a low-dose vitamin C tablet twice daily at times that they specified. Participants were considered adherent if they took the vitamin within 90 minutes (before or after) of the prescribed time. Adherence and activity in the home was measured using a system of sensors, including an instrumented pillbox. There were three phases of the study: baseline, in which there was no prompting; time-based, in which there was prompting at the prescribed times for pill-taking; and context-aware, in which participants were only prompted if they forgot to take their pills and were likely able to take their pills. The context-based prompting resulted in significantly better adherence (92. 3 %) as compared to time-based (73. 5 %) or no prompting (68. 1 %) conditions (p < 0. 0002, χ 2 = 17. 0). In addition, subjects had better adherence in the morning than in the evening. We have shown in this study that a system that generates reminders at an opportune time to take the medication significantly improves adherence. This study indicates that context-aware prompting may provide improved adherence over standard time-based <b>reminders.</b> <b>Key</b> words: home health telemonitoring, telehealth, information managemen...|$|R
