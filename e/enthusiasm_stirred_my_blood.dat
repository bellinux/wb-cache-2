"Thou ought'st to have bethought thee {{how much}} reason we pilgrims have to prize the mastiffs of the mountain," [...] {{answered}} Conrad, [...] "and how likely {{it was to}} <b>stir</b> <b>my</b> <b>blood</b> to see another cur devouring that which was intended for old Uberto.

Of course his courage and dexterity, with that of the red giant, Martin, have told against myself, have, in short, lost me a trick in the game. But I am an old soldier, and I can assure you that the details of their fight {{yesterday}} at the factory, and of their marvellous escape from--from--well, painful surroundings this morning, have <b>stirred</b> <b>my</b> <b>blood</b> and made <b>my</b> heart beat fast." ...|$|R

But there upon the ship my father compelled me. It was his fancy that I should break with you and be wed to Steinar, who had become so great a lord and who pleased him better than you did, Olaf. And, as for Steinar--why, have I not told you that he was mad for me?" ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{few days}} ago I said to a {{distinguished}} doctor of medicine, “I know no German, yet if a translation of German poet had moved me, I would go the British Museum and find books in English that would tell something about his life, and {{of the history of}} his thought. But though these prose translations from Rabindranath Tagore have <b>stirred</b> <b>my</b> <b>blood</b> as nothing has for years, I shall not know anything of his life, and of the movements of thought that have made them possible, if some Indian traveller will not tell me.” It seemed natural to him that I should be moved, for he said, “I read Rabindranath everyday, to read one line of him is to forget all the troubles of the world.” ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was with}} buoyant spirits that I rode homeward under the starlight across the wide, dim plain, for {{the cool air}} <b>stirred</b> <b>my</b> <b>blood,</b> and the great stillness seemed filled with possibilities. The {{uncertainty}} had vanished, the time was drawing in, and something whispered that before another winter draped white the prairie Grace would redeem her promise. Counted days as a rule pass slowly, but that fortnight fled, for there was little opportunity to think of anything but the work in hand in the hurry of the spring campaign, and one night Raymond Lyle, of Lone Hollow, and another of the Carrington colonists spent an hour with us. Since Aline honored Fairmead with her presence we had frequent visits from the younger among them. Aline was generally piquant, and these visitors, who, even if a few were rather feather-brained, were {{for the most part}} honest young Englishmen, seemed to find much pleasure in her company. Lyle, however, was a somewhat silent and thoughtful man, for whom I had a great liking, and he had come to discuss business.|$|R

40|$|Bagpipes and pipers, as {{cultural}} identifiers, are embedded within their national culture, charged with symbolisms. British authors have often viewed bagpipes {{as cultural}} icons, endowing them with connotations from devilish to virtuous, from rural to military. By analysing literary and artistic references one can perceive how the {{attitude towards the}} bagpipe changes with the evolution of Britain’s internal dynamics. Jacobitism contributed in casting a particular light on the bagpipe: it was the ‘voice of the rebellion’. In Scotland this constituted a reason for national pride, while in England the ‘common denominator’ of the Scot-enemy charged the bagpipe with the worst connotations. After Jacobitism stopped being seen as a threat, authors and artists came to view the bagpipe in a different light: the once negative icon was now imbued with ancestral values. The Scot – and the bagpipe by synecdoche – was romanticised: as James Boswell wrote, “The very Highland names, or {{the sound of a}} bagpipe, will <b>stir</b> <b>my</b> <b>blood,</b> and fill me with [ [...] . ] a crowd of sensations with which sober rationality has nothing to do” (1785). The words of many Romantic authors contributed in characterising the instrument, endowing it with implications the influence of which is still relevant today...|$|R

The smoke of the hickory faggots filling that conical roof-tree brought back to me a cloud of {{memories}} of the prairies of the Sioux, the lakes of the Chippewa, and the hills of the Cheyenne. Thin as were its walls, they shut out (for me) the commonplace present, helping me to reconstruct the world of Blackhawk and the Sitting Bull, and when I walked past it, especially at night, my mind took joy in its form, and a pleasant <b>stir</b> within <b>my</b> <b>blood</b> made manifest of its power.|$|R
