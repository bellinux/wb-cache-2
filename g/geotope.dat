5|$|The supreme {{responsibility}} for conservation {{lies with the}} Norwegian Ministry of the Environment, which has delegated the management to the Governor of Svalbard and the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management. The foundation for conservation {{was established in the}} Svalbard Treaty of 1920, and has been further specified in the Svalbard Environmental Act of 2001. The first round of protection took force on 1 July 1973, when most of the current protected areas came into effect. This included the two large nature reserves and three of the national parks. Moffen Nature Reserve was established in 1983, followed by four national parks, three nature reserves and one <b>geotope</b> protection area between 2002 and 2005.|$|E

40|$|Although we {{are slowly}} {{becoming}} aware of the necessity to preserve the <b>geotopes,</b> there are also problems arising from their protection. It is practically impossible to save some of <b>geotopes</b> in their entirety of which the quarry of Crni Kal near Koper is one example. Here are many interesting fossils including Palaeogene corals, foraminifera, molluscs and Pleistocene mammals in infilled karst caves...|$|R

The forest also has numerous rock formations, caves and dolines, {{some of which}} are classified as natural monuments or <b>geotopes.</b>|$|R
500|$|Svalbard is an Arctic {{wilderness}} archipelago {{comprising the}} northernmost part of Norway. There are twenty-nine protected natural areas, consisting of seven national parks, six nature reserves, fifteen bird sanctuaries and one <b>geotope</b> protected area. In addition, human traces dating from before 1946 are automatically protected. The protected areas make up [...] or 65% {{of the land}} area, and [...] or 86.5% of the territorial waters. The largest protected areas are Nordaust-Svalbard Nature Reserve and Søraust-Svalbard Nature Reserve, which cover most of the areas east of the main island of Spitsbergen, including the islands of Nordaustlandet, Edgeøya, Barentsøya, Kong Karls Land and Kvitøya. Six of the national parks are located on Spitsbergen. Ten of the bird sanctuaries and the Moffen Nature Reserve are located within national parks. Five of the bird sanctuaries are Ramsar sites and fourteen of the bird sanctuaries are islands. Svalbard is on Norway's tentative list for nomination as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E

These are objects whose {{features}} are assessed as homogenous and which cannot sensibly be subdivided into smaller landscapes.

50|$|<b>Geotopes</b> {{comprise}} geological outcrops, {{boulders and}} river delta formations. Geological rock outcrops, i.e. scenically striking rocky ridges {{are found in}} Fuchsberg and Stafflen in Jona, Heilig Hüsli in Rapperswil and the Hörnli glacial erratic in Oberbollingen. Extensive river deltas included that of the Jona and Aabach in Schmerikon, {{to a lesser degree}} of Sägenbächlein, Wagner and Lehholz in Jona and the Linth with side channels in Schmerikon.|$|R
50|$|The Siebenschneiderstein (Söbenschniedersteen) is a glacial erratic on {{the island}} of Rügen. It lies about 30 metres away from the cliffs of Gellort on the Baltic Sea beach, one {{kilometre}} northwest of Cape Arkona. It has a mass of 165 tonnes and a volume of 61 m³.

Extensive redevelopment measures have been carried out to try and prevent further deterioration of the ruins.

50|$|The 60- to 170-metre-deep gorges {{stretch for}} over 33 river {{kilometres}} (excluding side gorges) and are notable for many reasons. Their geologically young, prototypical and actively continuing development {{results in a}} great variety of <b>geotopes</b> and biotopes that support a correspondingly rich range of flora and fauna. The gorges are very popular with tourists and {{played an important role in}} the establishment of conservation consciousness in southwestern Germany. The Wutach Gorge is part of the Southern Black Forest Nature Park.|$|R
50|$|The Schwanenstein is a glacial erratic on {{the island}} of Rügen in Germany. It lies about 100 metres east of the harbour at Lohme on the {{northern}} shore of the Jasmund peninsula about 20 metres off the beach in the Baltic Sea. It weighs 162 tonnes and has a volume of 60 m³. It is thus the fifth largest erratic of about 20 other large glacial boulders that are part of Rügen’s legally protected <b>geotopes.</b> It is stylistically portrayed in Lohme’s coat of arms.|$|R
50|$|Large {{parts of}} the Elbe Sandstone Mountains are under {{statutory}} protection. In Germany there is the national park region of Saxon Switzerland, which consists two elements: the Saxon Switzerland National Park itself, founded in 1990 and covered an area of 93 km²; and the protected area surrounding it that was founded in 1956 and covers 287 km². The German part of the range was also designated in May 2006 {{as one of the}} 77 most important national <b>geotopes</b> in Germany by the Academy of Geosciences in Hanover.|$|R

50|$|The {{formation}} of the Kaiserstuhl volcano during the Tertiary was the climax {{and at the same}} time the end of volcanic activity in the Upper Rhine Valley Rift. Volcanism started as early as the Cretaceous Period. Volcanic landforms include heavily eroded volcanic vents. The Kaiserstuhl is the only larger volcano from this period in the rift valley. Geologically the Kaiserstuhl can be divided into two parts: the sedimentary and volcanic part. Due to these peculiarities the Kaiserstuhl has been labeled one of the most important national <b>geotopes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The northwestern {{and western}} sides of Rügen are also highly indented, {{but a little}} flatter. Offshore are the larger islands of Hiddensee and Ummanz {{as well as the}} smaller islands Öhe Liebitz and Heuwiese. Sand removal and {{deposition}} by the Baltic Sea has to be constantly countered by dredging operations to the north and south of Hiddensee, otherwise Hiddensee would merge with Rügen within a few years. Rügen is dotted with many glacial erratic boulders, of which the 22 largest belong to legally-protected <b>geotopes</b> (see also:Erratics on and around Rügen).|$|R
50|$|Such erratics on Rügen, {{which are}} made of {{crystalline}} and metamorphic rock, that have a minimum volume of 10 m³ belong to the legally protected <b>geotopes</b> on the island. For most erratics, however the volume cannot be exactly worked out, because they are normally partly embedded in the ground. The sizes given in the list are based on estimates {{by the majority of}} geologists given in their publications. In addition the list shows the estimated above-ground volumes; the below-ground element is not recorded. The approiximation factor of 0.6 is based on experience and accounts for the usual difference in volume from a rectangular block.|$|R
