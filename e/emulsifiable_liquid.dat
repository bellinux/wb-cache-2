40|$|Phosmet is a non-systemic, {{organophosphate}} insecticide used on both {{plants and}} animals. Phosmet {{may also be}} found in combination with other pesticides. • Phosmet is a General Use Pesticide (GUP). • EPA revoked some tolerances for phosmet in processed foods in 1994. • Phosmet is used mainly on apple tress for control of coddling moth. It is also used {{on a wide range of}} fruit crops, ornamentals and vines for the control of aphids, sucker, mites and fruit flies. The compound is also an active ingredient in some dog collars. • In Washington State, phosmet is available in <b>emulsifiable</b> <b>liquid</b> and spray powder formulations. • Products containing phosmet bear the signal word, “Warning ” on the product label. Phosmet is toxicity category II – moderately toxic and belongs to the organophosphate chemical class. • Major crop uses in Washington State, listed alphabetically, are as follows...|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the effects by which physical, chemical and biological agents (temperature, moisture, pH extremes, sunlight, proteolytic enzymes, bacteria, etc.) affect stability of the active substance of a biological insecticide, as the present one based on B. thuringiensis israelensis against mosquito’s larvae, is a prerequisite to identify the appropriate mix of ingredients (antioxidants, radical scavengers, UV protectants, etc.) required to protect the active substance during field application. Furthermore {{it is necessary to}} study how to avoid not homogeneous application, or settling of the product in aquatic environment, that can leave large sensible areas not covered by the active substance and spoil the overall insecticidal effect displayed by the product. The final objective is to develop a formulate with appropriate characteristics and persistence time for large scale field applications. Actually a new product with these characteristics (named BG z 1) has been developed by Bio & Geo S. r. l. by fermenting a B. thuringiensis israelensis H 14 strain, recovering and drying the parasporal crystals and than formulating these crystals as <b>emulsifiable</b> <b>liquid</b> concentrate, with the addition of protective ingredients and surfactants to enable easy mixing with water for an application as a spray on large areas to fully exploit the insecticidal properties displayed even at ppm concentration...|$|E
40|$|Oxyfluorfen is a pre-emergent and post-emergent {{broadleaf}} and grassy weed herbicide and is {{registered for}} use {{on a variety of}} field, fruit, and vegetable crops, ornamentals as well as non-crop sites. Oxyfluorfen is formulated for agricultural uses as an <b>emulsifiable</b> <b>liquid</b> concentrate and as a granular product, although it is most frequently used in a liquid formulation for food crops and as a granular formulation for ornamental nursery crops. There are also several ready-to-use products and a liquid concentrate available for residential use. Residential formulations contain 0. 25 % to 0. 70 % oxyfluorfen by volume and are packaged in a ready-to-use (RTU) sprinkler jug, a RTU trigger sprayer or as a liquid to be mixed in a sprinkler can or tank sprayer (EPA 2000). Oxyfluorfen is formulated with other active ingredients including oryzalin, glyphosate, pendamethalin, and Imazapyr. Oxyfluorfen is registered for residential use. An endangered species risk assessment is developed for federally listed Pacific salmon and steelhead. This assessment applies the findings of the Office of Pesticide Program’s Environmental Risk Assessment developed for non-target fish and wildlife as part of the reregistration process to determine the potential risks to the 26 listed threatened and endangered Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) of Pacific salmon and steelhead. The use of oxyfluorfen will have no direct or indirect effect from loss of food supply or loss of cover in the 26 ESUs of Pacific salmon and steelhead when used according to labeled application directions...|$|E
40|$|Triclopyr is a {{selective}} systemic herbicide {{used to control}} unwanted woody and herbaceous weeds (1). $ Triclopyr is sold predominately as a triclopyr triethylamine salt (TEA) or triclopyr butoxyethyl ester (BEE) (1). How is triclopyr used? $ Triclopyr was first registered in 1979 for non-crop areas and forests. In descending order of amounts applied (1987 to 1995), triclopyr is currently registered for use on pasture and rangeland, forests, rights-of-way, rice, and lawns. (1). See Laboratory Testing box. $ Triclopyr TEA is formulated as soluble and <b>emulsifiable</b> concentrates, <b>liquids,</b> granulars, wettable powders, pellets, or formulation intermediates. Triclopyr BEE is formulated as <b>emulsifiable</b> concentrates, ready-to-use <b>liquids</b> or formulation intermediates (1). What are some products that contain triclopyr...|$|R
