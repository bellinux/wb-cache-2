The catheter is removed when the drainage becomes minimal. Once the catheter is removed, contrast is injected into the cyst cavity to determine the remaining size and to monitor progress.

50|$|The ICM and the TE will {{generate}} distinctly different cell types as implantation starts and embryogenesis continues. Trophectoderm cells form extraembryonic tissues, which {{act in a}} supporting role for the embryo proper. Furthermore, these cells pump fluid into {{the interior of the}} blastocyst, causing the formation of a polarized blastocyst with the ICM attached to the trophectoderm at one end (see figure). This difference in cellular localization causes the ICM cells exposed to the <b>fluid</b> <b>cavity</b> to adopt a primitive endoderm (or hypoblast) fate, while the remaining cells adopt a primitive ectoderm (or epiblast) fate. The hypoblast contributes to extraembryonic membranes and the epiblast will give rise to the ultimate embryo proper as well as some extraembryonic tissues.|$|E

40|$|This paper gives a new {{approach}} for modeling the fluid-structure interaction of servovalve component-actuator. The analyzed valve is a precision flow control valve-jet pipe electrohydraulic servovalve. The positioning of an actuator depends upon the flow rate from control ports, in turn depends on the spool position. Theoretical investigation is made for No-load condition and Load condition for an actuator. These are used in finite element modeling of an actuator. The fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) is established between the piston and the <b>fluid</b> <b>cavities</b> at the piston end. The <b>fluid</b> <b>cavities</b> were modeled with special purpose hydrostatic fluid elements while the piston is modeled with brick elements. The finite element method is used to simulate the variation of cavity pressure, cavity volume, mass flow rate, and the actuator velocity. The finite element analysis is extended to study the system's linearized response to harmonic excitation using direct solution steady-state dynamics. It was observed from the analysis that the natural frequency of the actuator depends upon {{the position of the}} piston in the cylinder. This is a close match with theoretical and simulation results. The effect of bulk modulus is also presented in the paper...|$|R

Study subjects were 28 patients with bacteriologically confirmed active tuberculous serositis and 47 patients with definitive nontuberculous etiology. Culture was performed for 18 h with fluid mononuclear cells in the supernatant of the effusion together with saline or Mycobacterium tuberculosis–specific antigenic peptides, early secretory antigenic target 6 and culture filtrate protein 10.

The Dual Modal Formulation (DMF) allows describing the fluid-structure coupling using the modes of each uncoupled subsystem. After having studied the convergence of the modal series on a test case, we estimate the modal energies and the total energy of each subsystem. An analysis of modal energy distribution is performed. It allows us to study the validity of SEA assumptions for this case. Added mass and added stiffness effects of the fluid are observed. These effects {{are related to the}} non resonant acoustic modes below and above the frequency band of excitation. Moreover, the role of the spatial coupling of the resonant cavity modes with the non resonant structure modes is also highlighted. As a result, the energy transmitted between the structure and the heavy <b>fluid</b> <b>cavity</b> generally cannot be deduced from the SEA relation established for a light <b>fluid</b> <b>cavity...</b>|$|E

A substantial improvement could be expected for nonuniform, hot-spot-aware fluid cavities. Hence, we propose an extension of our multi-scale modeling framework to support nonuniform <b>fluid</b> <b>cavity</b> designs. The chip stack with its cavities and the silicon dies are represented by field-coupled porous and solid domains, respectively. Detailed sub-domain modeling using two pairs of periodic boundary conditions for fully and half populated pin-fin arrays with 100 m height and pitch was performed. Permeability and convective thermal resistance values with respect to arbitrary flow directions were extracted. These values are used in the chip stack model to predict the mass and the energy transport within the <b>fluid</b> <b>cavity</b> and between the domains, respectively. Three mathematical permeability descriptions are benchmarke d against each other and are experimentaly validated.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is the development of}} a fundamental understanding of the acoustics and piezoelectric transducer governing the operation of piezoelectric inkjets and horn-based ultrasonic atomizers when utilizing high viscosity working fluids. This work creates coupled, electro-mechanical analytical models of the acoustic behavior of these devices by extending models from the literature which make minimal simplifications in the handling terms that account for viscous losses. Models are created for each component of the considered fluid ejectors: piezoelectric transducers, acoustic pipes, and acoustic horns. The acoustic pipe models consider the two limited cases when either the acoustic boundary layer or attenuation losses dominate the acoustic field and are adapted to account for changes in cross-sectional area present in acoustic horns. A full electro-mechanical analytical model of the fluid ejectors is formed by coupling the component models using appropriate boundary conditions. The developed electro-mechanical model is applied to understand the acoustic response of the <b>fluid</b> <b>cavity</b> alone and when combined with the transducer in horn-based ultrasonic atomizers. An understanding of the individual and combined acoustic response of the <b>fluid</b> <b>cavity</b> and piezoelectric transducer allow for an optimal geometry to be selected for the ejection of high viscosity working fluids. The maximum pressure gradient magnitude produced by the atomizer is compared to the pressure gradient threshold required for fluid ejection predicted by a hydrodynamic scaling analysis. The maximum working fluid viscosity of the standard horn-based ultrasonic atomizer and those with dual working fluid combinations, a low viscosity and a high viscosity working fluid to minimize viscous dissipation, is established to be on the order of 100 mPas. The developed electro-mechanical model is also applied to understand the acoustic response of the <b>fluid</b> <b>cavity</b> and annular piezoelectric transducer in squeeze type ejectors with high viscosity working fluids. The maximum pressure gradient generated by the ejector is examined {{as a function of the}} principle geometric properties. The maximum pressure gradient magnitude produced by the ejector is again compared to the pressure gradient threshold derived from hydrodynamic scaling. The upper limit on working fluid viscosity is established as 100 mPas. Ph. D...|$|E

For the purpose of preventing the postoperative convulsions after craniotomy, 100 mg of GABOB was applied on the cerebral surface during craniotomy in 293 cases of brain tumor. Except for operative deaths, a comparison of the postoperative convulsions was made between the GABOB group and the control group. 1) The occurrence of postoperative convulsions was decreased in the GABOB group. 2) In the GABOB group, the onset of postoperative convulsions was later than that of the control group. 3) Frequency of postoperative convulsions was decreased in the GABOB group, and majority of the cases showed only one seizure. 4) Administration of GABOB into the intradural cavity showed no side effect.
