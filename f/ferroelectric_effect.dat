40|$|Abstract. First-principles {{calculations}} {{are performed}} to investigate alloying and <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>effects</b> in {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PZT) with high Ti composition. We find that {{the main effect of}} alloying in the paraelectric phase of PZT is the existence of two sets of B–O bonds, i. e., shorter Ti–O bonds vs. longer Zr–O bonds. On the other hand, ferroelectricity leads to the formation of very short covalent Ti–O bonds and to the formation of covalent chains of Pb–O bonds. The covalency in the ferroelectric phase is mainly induced by an enhancement of hybridization between Ti 3 d and O 2 p, and between Pb 6 s and O 2 p.

30|$|The unique {{properties}} of the <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>effect,</b> particularly its spontaneous, switchable, and permanent polarization have attracted many researchers to develop many application devices, and energy harvesting technologies have exploited the unique {{properties of}} ferroelectric material. Energy harvesters convert various energy sources to electrical energy. Ferroelectric polarization can {{have an important role}} to increase output power of energy harvesters by enhancing internal potential. Strong ferroelectric polarization produces high piezoelectric potential and surface potential. For mechanical stability and robustness in PENG and TENG, the oxide ferroelectric materials were deposited in thin film or imbedded in polymer matrix. Using oxide ferroelectric powder-polymer composite and ferroelectric polymer P(VDF-TrFE), very highly stable PENG and stretchable PENG were developed. In the case of TENG, controlling the surface potential is crucial. The ferroelectric polarization modified and attracted more charges, resulting in higher output power. With high output TENG, it was demonstrated that electronic devices such as smart watch and humidity-temperature meter can be driven and charged simultaneously. In addition, ferroelectric polymer P(VDF-TrFE) which has pyroelectricity was micro-patterned in order to develop stretchable PEG, and hybrid pyroelectric effect and piezoelectric effect for high output. Finally, {{it was found that the}} energy level at junction in photovoltaic cell can be adjusted to increase VOC and JSC.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} proposes {{and studies}} {{the idea of}} single molecule piezoelectrics and ferroelectrics via both computational and experimental means. The research is aimed {{to open a new}} area of piezoelectric/ferroelectric materials for next generation of nanoscale, flexible, efficient, and multifunctional electronic devices. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed to study the electric field induced conformational change (piezoelectric effect) of three molecular springs: asymmetrically substituted helicenes, asymmetrically substituted phenanthrenes, and oligoaminoacids and the electric field driven polarization inversion (<b>ferroelectric</b> <b>effect)</b> of molecular bowls (buckybowls). Molecular structure, functional groups, dipole moment, and regiochemistry are discussed as factors to generate good single molecule piezoelectrics and ferroelectrics. A significantly large piezoelectric coefficient (up to 272 pm/V for a hypothetical helicene derivative and 450 pm/V for a hypothetical buckybowl derivative) and a broad range of inversion field (0. 26 V/nm - 9. 05 V/nm for buckybowls) are predicted. Our proposed materials could potentially compete with conventional piezo/ferroelectric materials (e. g. zinc oxide (ZnO), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), and lead zirconium titanate (PZT), etc.). The piezoelectric effect of single molecules are experimentally demonstrated with a sample of patterned self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of oligoaminoacids via techniques of piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Combined with our computational predictions, we believe that a new class of piezoelectric/ferroelectric materials may be created from the “bottom up” based on molecular conformational changes, which are new material resources for fabricating flexible, large scale, ultrathin, and lightweight electronic devices. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{have shown}} {{previously}} [1] that the cubic paraelectric phase of BaTiO 3 and KNbO 3 is disordered : the atoms are displaced {{from the high}} symmetry position of the ideal perovskite structure and the displacements are correlated along lines parallel to the cubic axes. The anisotropic fluctuation domains or "correlation chains" involve the correlated motion of about 20 unit cells and give rise to an intense diffuse X-Ray scattering localized in { 100 } reciprocal planes. The case of KMnF 3 and NaNbO 3 is different since these crystals undergo, when the temperature is lowered, a structural transition from the cubic phase to a quite different tetragonal phase : due to {{the rotation of the}} fluorine or oxygen octahedra [2], [3] there is a doubling of the unit cell parameters. The X-Ray diffuse scattering patterns show that the cubic phase of these materials is highly disordered. For KMnF 3, the scattering is restricted to the < 100 < reciprocal axes passing through the superlattice nods of the lower temperature phase [4]. This means that the atomic displacements related to the octahedra rotation are correlated in the { 100 } planes of the crystal, and involve a local doubling of the unit ceIl even in the cubic phase. The case of NaNbO 3 is even more complex : the two kinds of scattering (planes and rods) are present on the X ray pictures. The two kinds of disorder are present simultaneously in the cubic phase : correlation chains related to the off-centering of atoms (and the <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>effect),</b> correlation planes associated to the octahedra rotations [5]...|$|E

Certain new LC switches based {{on the effect of}} total internal reflection in nematic LC and deformed helix <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>effect</b> ferroelectric LC with very fast response time were developed. Fast bistable optical switches of the light polarization based on ferroelectric liquid crystal cells were proposed. The switches are characterized by 100 ìs switching time and 26 dB crosstalk at the wavelength of 632. 8 nm and bistable, i. e., required zero power consumption in the switch state. High frequency hysteretic free electrically controlled 0 - 2 π phase modulation of light has been proposed using a very short helix pitch (less than 400 nm) deformed helix ferroelectric liquid crystal. The electrically controlled 0 - 2 π hysteretic free phase modulation was achieved at the driving voltage frequency up to 4 kHz and the voltage amplitude of 32 V. The application of fast V-shaped deformed helix ferroelectric ferroelectric LC (DHF-FLC) for new active-matrix liquid crystal display (LCD) and optical data processing devices is envisaged. Photoalignment technology can be very useful for the new generation of liquid crystal devices as well as in new photovoltaic, optoelectronic and photonic devices based on highly ordered thin organic layers. We have investigated the LC photoalignment in superthin tubes, which are basic elements of switchable photonic crystal/liquid crystal structures and obtained the order parameter comparable with usual homogeneous nematic LC cells. We studied LC alignment on silicon surfaces with submicrometer-sized straight and curved waveguide profiles. The liquid crystal cladding refractive index was then varied according to the applied voltage, and subsequently the microresonator resonance wavelengths were tuned. Based on our initial measurements, the free spectral range (FSR) wavelength shift within the range of 20 nm was obtained, which is comparable with a thermooptic effect.

The as-prepared ceramic powder was calcined at 600 &# 176;C {{to remove any}} organic residuesafter the spray pyrolysis process. Different milling methods for the calcined powderswere attempted, revealing dry planetary milling {{to be the most}} suitable milling method. The powders were characterised using scanning electron microscopy. A complete millingprocess was developed based on sufficient destruction of the egg-shell like agglomerates from the spray pyrolysis process, avoidance of flake formation and reproducibility. Sintering was attempted using three different sintering methods, all using the reverse crucible method to limit the amount of alkali evaporation. An optimal temperature range was found for each of the three, achieving densities in the range of 94 - 97 %. The microstructure of the different samples was explored by polishing the samples and investigating the surfaces by scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the average grain sizes were in the range of a few microns, with large variations in the broadness of the grain size distribution when comparing different sintering methods. For two of the three sintering methods a standard deviation of less than 0. 3 micron is reported. An EDS analysis was performed, and it was found that all the samples demonstratecompositional homogenity. Dielectric testing was performed on the samples sintered using the three differentsintering methods. Polishing of the sample surfaces and storage in dessicators had tobe performed in order to avoid moisture influence and achieve reproducibility. Thepiezo- and <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>effect</b> was observed for all the different sintering methods, along with coercive fields in the range of 669 - 889 Vmm and remnant polarizations in the range of 16 - 29 C/cm 2, depending on the sintering method used.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} lies in the theoretical description of electrical field- and mechanical stress-induced phase transitions and their influence on the material behavior of ferroelectric single crystals, polycrystals and composite materials. Phase transitions are interesting phenomena that lead to improved properties of the ferroelectric material. The motivation for this work {{is presented in the}} first Chapter. Chapter 2 gives a short introduction on the basic formalism of electrostatics and continuum mechanics, which are the foundations of material models of ferroelectrics. In addition, some fundamentals of crystallography will be discussed to understand the atomistic reason of the <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>effect.</b> In the first part of Chapter 3, a two dimensional Landau type model is presented, which is used to study electrical field-induced tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transitions in arbitrary ferroelectric single crystal materials. The Landau energy landscape was varied to examine the influence of the switching energies and the polarization rotation path on the predicted phase transition field. In the second part, the model is expanded to three dimensions. Landau parameters from literature were used to predict the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition behavior of BaTiO 3. Large signal measurements on single crystalline BaTiO 3 were performed to verify the model and to compare the predictive capabilities of the various Landau potentials. In Chapter 4, the Landau model is further expanded to describe polycrystalline ferroelectrics like Pb(Zr,Ti) O 3 under uniaxial compressive strain and electric field. In contrast to micro-mechanical models, the Landau energy model intrinsically considers tetragonal to rhombohedral phase transitions. These induced transitions provide a good explanation for the exceptional switching strain of rhombohedral Pb(Zr,Ti) O 3 compositions close to the MPB. Chapter 5 and 6 elucidate a different type of field-induced phase transition. Novel lead free materials, such as BNT- 6 BT- 2 KNN, show exceptional unipolar usable strain values that are larger than Pb(Zr,Ti) O 3. Without any applied field these materials show nearly no remanent polarization and strain. Internal mechanisms prohibit the development of long-range interactions between the unit cells, so that the system decays in a disordered nano-domain state. Unfortunately, the fields that are required to induce a phase transition to a polar phase are too high for most applications. A composite structure with a chemical compatible ferroelectric material is used to decrease the required electric field. Two models are proposed to predict the dielectric behavior of a composite from the behavior of both components. In Chapter 5 the composite is replaced by a series configuration of two nonlinear hysteretic capacitors. The model is verified by comparing the results to experimental data from composite samples, and used to identify optimal material parameter combination for future materials. In the second model that is presented in Chapter 6, a two dimensional phase field implementation is expanded by a material model for the high strain material. In contrast to the previous case, this model allows one to study the influence of the microstructure on the composite effect. The model is then applied to test cases to demonstrate its capabilities. ...|$|E

40|$|Materials {{chemistry}} is essentially {{concerned with the}} design/synthesis of new solids endowed with functional properties that could be of relevance to today’s materials technology. Among the large variety of solid materials that attract attention, metal oxides continue to contribute significantly to current materials chemistry. A wide variety of oxide materials (based on rocksalt, spinel, corundum, perovskite, garnet, pyrochlore and other structures) and their properties have been investigated over the years. Most of these oxides are derived from the transition metals. Transition metal oxides with structures derived from metal-oxygen (MO 6) octahedra, in particular, display an array of exotic properties with potential or proven technological application. While it is traditionally believed that the partially filled d shell (dn : 0 < n < 10) of the transition metal atoms {{plays a crucial role}} in deciding the electronic properties, the significance of d 0 metal atoms for the properties (and structure) of transition metal oxides is not fully recognized. Magnetism (SrRuO 3, Fe 3 O 4), metallicity (ReO 3, LaNiO 3), colossal magnetoresistance (La 1 -xCaxMnO 3) and superconductivity (La 2 xSrxCuO 4, Sr 2 RuO 4) are some of the properties that {{can be traced to the}} presence of partially filled d shell, while properties like ferroelectricity (BaTiO 3), piezoelectricity (PbZr 1 -xTixO 3) and nonlinear optical response (LiNbO 3) could be traced to the presence of transition metals (TiIV, ZrIV, NbV) with d 0 electronic configuration. The empty d orbitals on the metal atoms constitute the low lying unoccupied states (LUMO) that mix with the highest occupied states (HOMO) of the ligand atoms (oxygen) through special chemical bonding effects (second order Jahn-Teller effect, SOJT). This mixing results, among others, in out-of-centre distortion(s) of the MO 6 octahedra and this distortion is at the heart of several properties mentioned above. Among the transition metal oxide structures based on MO 6 octahedra, three structures are noteworthy: the perovskite, the pyrochlore and the rutile. The AMO 3 perovskite structure consists of a three-dimensional framework of corner sharing MO 6 octahedra in which the A cation occupies the dodecahedral site surrounded by twelve oxide ions. The perovskite structure can accommodate a large variety of substitutions at both the A and the M sites as well as vacancies at the A/O sites, giving a large number of derivatives. Several variants of the perovskite structure are also known, for instance, the layered perovskites and ordered perovskites. Many nonperovskite structures are also known for the composition AMO 3 : hexagonal YMnO 3 is an alternative structure for AMO 3 composition where manganese exists as MnO 5 trigonal bipyramids. The A 2 M 2 O 7 pyrochlore structure is also based on a corner-connected network of MO 6 octahedra which interpenetrates an A 2 O network. The rutile (TiO 2) is a well-known structure consisting of chains of edge-sharing MO 6 octahedra, which are connected through corners to adjacent chains. A large number of oxide materials based on the above three structure types have been reported : for example, perovskite [Ba 3 ZnTa 2 O 9 (microwave telecommunication ceramic), Pb 3 MgNb 2 O 9 (relaxor ferroelectric), Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 (high temperature ferroelectric) ], pyrochlore [Nd 2 Mo 2 O 7 (metallic ferromagnet), AOs 2 O 6 for A = K, Rb, Cs (superconductor) ] and rutile [TiO 2 (photocatalyst), CrO 2 (metallic ferromagnet), VO 2 (insulator-metal transition) ]. Considering the current interest in oxide materials of these three structure types which continue to generate new variants and novel properties, we undertook the present research project to synthesize new derivatives of these structure types, and characterize their structures and relevant electronic properties. In doing so, we recognized that synthesis based on an understanding of the reactivity of the constituents and crystal chemistry of the expected products plays a crucial role in this effort. Accordingly, we tailored several new compositions of AMO 3, A 2 M 2 O 7 and MO 2 stoichiometries and adopted appropriate methodologies for their synthesis. We have characterized the structures and properties of the solid products by means of state-of-the-art methods available to us. There are two main approaches to the synthesis of nonmolecular inorganic solids: conventional ceramic route and chimie douce / soft chemistry routes. In the ceramic route, solid reactants are heated at elevated temperatures for long durations with intermittent mixing/grinding until the reaction is complete. Chimie douce routes, on the other hand, utilize gentle reactions such as dehydration, decomposition, intercalation, ion exchange, and so on to synthesize the desired phases. The ceramic route generally provides access to the thermodynamically controlled product(s), while chimie douce routes allow access to metastable phases (kinetically controlled product(s)). Disadvantages notwithstanding, the ceramic route has been the mainstay of materials chemistry and several important materials continue to be discovered / synthesized by this route. The choice of the synthetic route based on an understanding of the crystal chemical preferences and the reactivities of the constituents involved is often crucial to achieve the desired final products. The present thesis is devoted to the synthesis and investigation of MO 6 octahedra-based oxides belonging to the perovskite, pyrochlore and rutile structure types wherein we have explored alternate synthetic strategies (perovskite-based Ba 3 MM' 2 O 9 telecommunication ceramics and a solution route for the synthesis of ruthenium-based pyrochlores) and probed structure-property relations of perovskite oxides (Ba 3 MM'M''O 9 oxides for various M/M'/M'' atoms) as well as formation of new derivatives of layered Aurivillius phases. In addition, we have also synthesized new noncentrosymmetric oxides possessing the YMnO 3 structure. Our investigation of rutile based oxides has resulted in the discovery of a new lead-free relaxor ferroelectric material, FeTiTaO 6. Given that the lone pair PbII: 6 s 2 plays a crucial role in the ferroelectric properties of Pb-based perovskite oxides, we have also investigated members of the Pb 1 -xLix/ 2 Lax/ 2 TiO 3 system for their structure and dielectric response. The present thesis describes the results of these investigations in eight chapters. Chapter 1 provides a general introduction to oxides of the perovskite, pyrochlore and rutile structures. In Chapter 2, we describe a new one-pot metathesis strategy for the synthesis of dielectric ceramics Ba 3 MM' 2 O 9 (M = Mg, Ni, Zn; M' = Nb, Ta). Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction data shows near-complete ordering of M-site ions in many cases. The dielectric properties of the products synthesized are found to be in reasonable agreement with reported data. The synthesis of ordered materials at lower temperatures (~ 1100 °C) than that employed in the conventional ceramic route (~ 1500 °C) is a significant result of this work. Chapter 3 presents a study of Ba 3 MIIMIVWO 9 (MII = Ca, Zn; MIV = Ti, Zr) perovskite oxides for the purpose of synthesizing new dielectric ceramic materials and to gain understanding of the factors that stabilize 3 C vs. 6 H structures. In general, a 1 : 2 -ordered 6 H perovskite structure is stabilized at high temperatures (1300 °C) for all of the Ba 3 MIITiWO 9 oxides investigated. An intermediate phase possessing a partially ordered 1 : 1 double perovskite (3 C) structure with the cation distribution, Ba 2 (Zn 2 / 3 Ti 1 / 3) (W 2 / 3 Ti 1 / 3) O 6, is obtained at 1200 °C for Ba 3 ZnTiWO 9. A metastable perovskite, Ba 3 CaZrWO 9, that adopts the 1 : 1 3 C structure has also been synthesized by a low-temperature metathesis route. Besides yielding several new perovskite oxides that may be useful as dielectric ceramics, the investigation provides new insights into the complex interplay of crystal chemistry (tolerance factor) and chemical bonding (anion polarization and d 0 -induced distortion of metaloxygen octahedra) in the stabilization of 6 H versus 3 C perovskite structures for the Ba 3 MIIMIVWO 9 series. In Chapter 4, we describe the synthesis and investigation of the structure and dielectric properties of Ba 3 MIIITiMVO 9 (MIII = Fe, Ga, Y, Lu; MV = Nb, Ta, Sb) perovskite oxides. The MV = Nb, Ta oxides adopt disordered/partially ordered 3 C perovskite structures, where all the MIII/Ti/MV metal-oxygen octahedra are corner-connected. In contrast, the MV = Sb oxides show a distinct preference for the 6 H structure, where SbV/TiIV metal-oxygen octahedra share a common face, forming (Sb,Ti) O 9 dimers, that are corner-connected to the MIIIO 6 octahedra. Investigation of dielectric properties of MIII = Y/Lu, MV = Nb/Ta oxides reveals a normal low loss dielectric behaviour with ε = 30 – 50 in the temperature range 50 – 350 °C. The MIII = Fe, MV = Nb/Ta members show a dielectric behaviour similar to relaxor ferroelectric materials. Chapter 5 deals with a study of isomorphous substitution of several metal atoms in two Aurivillius structures, Bi 5 TiNbWO 15 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12, in an effort to probe structure-property correlations. These investigations have led to the synthesis of new derivatives, Bi 4 LnTiMWO 15 (Ln, = La, Pr; M = Nb, Ta), as well as Bi 4 PbNb 2 WO 15 and Bi 3 LaPbNb 2 WO 15, that largely retain the Aurivillius intergrowth structure of the parent oxide Bi 5 TiNbWO 15, but characteristically tend toward a centrosymmetric / tetragonal structure for the Ln-substituted derivatives. On the other hand, coupled substitution, 2 TiIV Æ MV + FeIII in Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12, yields new Aurivillius phases, Bi 4 Ti 3 - 2 xNbxFexO 12 (x = 0. 25, 0. 50) and Bi 4 Ti 3 - 2 xTaxFexO 12 (x = 0. 25) that retain the orthorhombic noncentrosymmetric structure of the parent Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12. Chapter 6 describes the design and synthesis of a new series of noncentrosymmetric oxides, R 3 Mn 1. 5 CuV 0. 5 O 9 (R = Y, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu) possessing the YMnO 3 structure. Investigation of the Lu-Mn-Cu-V-O system revealed the existence of an isostructural solid solution series, Lu 3 Mn 3 - 3 xCu 2 xVxO 9 for 0 < x ≤ 0. 75. Magnetic and dielectric properties of the oxides are consistent with a random distribution of Mn 3 +, Cu 2 + and V 5 + atoms that preserves the noncentrosymmetric RMnO 3 structure. An exploratory investigation of the synthesis, structure and electronic properties of new ruthenium(IV) pyrochlore oxides and their manganese-substituted derivatives is presented in Chapter 7. The richness of the electronic properties of ruthenium-based metal oxides is affirmed by the results which revealed several novel electronic ground states : a metallic and Pauli paramagnetic state for BiPbRu 2 O 6. 5 that turns into a semiconducting ferromagnetic spin-glass state at 50 K for BiPbRuMnO 6. 5; a metallic state that likely shows a charge density wave (CDW) instability at 50 - 225 K for Bi 1. 50 Zn 0. 50 Ru 2 O 6. 75, that is suppressed by manganese substitution in Bi 1. 50 Zn 0. 50 Ru 1. 75 Mn 0. 25 O 6. 50, and a metallic ferromagnetic spin-glass-like state for Pb 2 Ru 1. 75 Mn 0. 25 O 6. 15. We describe the investigation of the structure and dielectric properties of rutile-based MTiTaO 6 (M = Al, Cr, Fe) in Chapter 8. All the oxides possess disordered rutile structure. FeTiTaO 6 shows a strong relaxor <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>effect,</b> while CrTiTaO 6 shows a weaker relaxor ferroelectric behaviour. This work is significant for two reasons: the new material is lead-free and it is based on the rutile structure, unlike the conventional relaxors which are mostly derived from the perovskite structure. The work presented in the thesis is carried out by the candidate as a part of the Ph. D. training programme and most of it has been published in the literature. She hopes that the studies reported here will constitute a worthwhile contribution to materials chemistry in general...|$|E

The optical band gap and Urbach energy of the transparent glasses and glass nanocomposites (heat treated at 500 °C) were found to be composition dependent. The samples that were heat treated at 550 °C exhibited broad dielectric anomalies in the vicinity of ferroelectric to paraelectric transition temperature of the parent SBN ceramics.
