5|$|Gert {{was a large}} {{tropical}} cyclone {{for most of its}} lifespan; <b>it</b> <b>always</b> remained close enough to the coast to restrengthen and redevelop strong thunderstorms. In consequence, the storm produced heavy rainfall over a large area, causing extensive flooding and mudslides from Central America to Mexico. The disaster resulted in at least 116deaths and 16missing persons; damage to roads, property, crops and vegetation surmounted $170million.|$|E
5|$|Pediatricians {{are often}} the first health {{professionals}} to assess and raise suspicions of RAD in children with the disorder. The initial presentation varies according to the child's developmental and chronological age, although <b>it</b> <b>always</b> involves a disturbance in social interaction. Infants up to about 18–24 months may present with non-organic failure to thrive and display abnormal responsiveness to stimuli. Laboratory investigations will be unremarkable barring possible findings consistent with malnutrition or dehydration, while serum growth hormone levels will be normal or elevated.|$|E

5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation: it rotates {{about its}} axis {{in about the}} same time it takes to orbit Earth.

5|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>always</b> had {{hundreds}} of competitors, Standard Oil gradually gained dominance of oil refining and sales as market share in the United States through horizontal integration, ending up with about 90% of the US market. In the kerosene industry, the company replaced the old distribution system with its own vertical system. It supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought the fuel to local markets, and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers, thus bypassing the existing network of wholesale jobbers. Despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% {{over the life of}} the company), Standard Oil's business practices created intense controversy. Standard's most potent weapons against competitors were underselling, differential pricing, and secret transportation rebates.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the Jewish Resistance Movement was formed, {{comprising}} several pre-existing Jewish groups. In 1921, the part-time Haganah was formed and trained as a national army. Most Jewish males and some females were required to join. After the Second World War, it obtained numerous surplus weapons to equip its members. The Haganah gave priority to increasing the Jewish population by bringing immigrants into the country from Europe. <b>It</b> <b>always</b> attempted to give prior notice of an attack so that any security service personnel in the area could be evacuated.|$|E

5|$|Malaysia {{rejected}} Singapore's {{argument that}} the traditional Malay concept of sovereignty was based mainly on control over people and not over territory. It stated that authority in states throughout the world {{is based on a}} combination of control over people and territory, and that this applies to the Malay States as it does to any other state. Since the Johor Sultanate was established in the 16th century, <b>it</b> <b>always</b> had rulers who were recognised as such and who thus commanded people's allegiance and therefore controlled the territory where those people lived.|$|E
5|$|One {{consequence}} of this fact appears in the bit-reversed ordering of integer data types used by some computer algorithms, such as the Cooley–Tukey fast Fourier transform. This ordering has the property that the farther to the left the first 1 occurs in a number's binary expansion, or the more times it is divisible by 2, the sooner it appears. Zero's bit reversal is still zero; it can be divided by 2 any number of times, and its binary expansion does not contain any 1s, so <b>it</b> <b>always</b> comes first.|$|E

5|$|The {{gravitational}} attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth. The {{same effect}} on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period {{is the same as}} the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, <b>it</b> <b>always</b> presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminator.|$|E
5|$|The {{main idea}} of the {{algorithm}} is to find pairs of clusters to merge by following paths in the nearest neighbor graph of the clusters. Every such path will eventually terminate at a pair of clusters that are nearest neighbors of each other, and the algorithm chooses that pair of clusters as the pair to merge. In order to save work by re-using {{as much as possible}} of each path, the algorithm uses a stack data structure to keep track of each path that it follows. By following paths in this way, the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm merges its clusters in a different order than methods that always find and merge the closest pair of clusters. However, despite that difference, <b>it</b> <b>always</b> generates the same hierarchy of clusters.|$|E
5|$|To {{the naked}} eye, Venus {{appears as a}} white point of light {{brighter}} than any other planet or star (apart from the Sun). Its brightest apparent magnitude, −4.9, occurs during crescent phase, only 36 days before or after inferior conjunction. Venus will be brightest on 30 April 2017, then grow dimmer for nearly a year. Venus fades to about magnitude −3 when it is backlit by the Sun. The planet is bright enough {{to be seen in}} a clear midday sky and is more easily visible when the Sun is low on the horizon or setting. As an inferior planet, <b>it</b> <b>always</b> lies within about 47° of the Sun.|$|E

5|$|Combat {{received}} a polarized response; critics alternately called the battles deep and satisfying or shallow and repetitive. Reviewers considered the combat mechanics to be simplistic while allowing for complex tactics, {{and others said}} that the requirement to actively defend against enemy attacks and enhance offense kept fights engaging. Others also praised the combat but considered the mechanics to be robust and elaborate, presenting a solid role-playing combat system concealed under the intentionally simplistic visuals. Some reviewers said {{that a lack of}} depth made combat gradually become repetitive; they said that even when combat is funny and engaging, {{by the end of the}} game the battles can become routine. Joystiq stated that defense was more interesting than offense because it relied on time-sensitive reactions to creative enemy attacks such as Al Gore giving a presentation. Destructoid said there are too few powers available for offense for the game to remain interesting for long. GameSpot found combat was too easy and lacking in challenge because of an abundance of supplement items such as health packs that were found more frequently than they were used, and powerful abilities that quickly subdued opponents. Others disagreed, stating that the variety offered in combat, such as character abilities, allies, weapons, armor, and upgrades, ensured <b>it</b> <b>always</b> felt fun. The effects of the enhancements were sometimes considered to be confusing, and typically relying on simply equipping the highest level item available. Joystiq said the special characters that can be summoned during battle were extreme in terms of power and entertainment value.|$|E
5|$|Senator Don Cameron of Pennsylvania {{purchased}} the Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House for $60,000 in 1887, and resided {{there for a}} time. Cameron expanded the home significantly, almost entirely rebuilding its interior. After the renovation, the front entrance opened onto a square entrance hall. A fireplace adorned the hall. Large rooms {{on either side of}} the entrance hall were used as office space. A broad staircase led from the entrance hall up to the second floor, where there were four large rooms. The rooms opened on to one another, permitting the second floor to be opened up into something approaching a single large ballroom. The windows on the second floor reached to the floor. An iron veranda ran around the entire second floor. The home contained a total of 30 rooms after the renovation. Cameron did not, however, renovate the exterior, which remained much the same as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> had. Henry Adams was a frequent guest of the Camerons, playing often with their daughter Martha to alleviate his bouts of depression.|$|E
5|$|The edible Coprinellus bisporus {{is nearly}} {{identical}} but lacks the yellowish cap granules and only has two spores per basidium. The scaly inky cap (Coprinus variegatus = Coprinus quadrifidus) has a grayish-brown cap with dull white to brownish scales; its odor is disagreeable. The trooping crumble cap (Coprinellus disseminatus, edible) has smaller, yellow-brown to grey-brown caps and white gills that turn black {{but do not}} dissolve away; <b>it</b> <b>always</b> grows in large clusters on rotting wood (sometimes buried wood). Coprinus atramentarius is a larger, gray species that grows in dense clusters on stumps or on the ground from buried wood, lacks glistening particles on the cap, and the cap and gills dissolve at maturity. Coprinellus radians develops singly or in clumps from a tufted mat of coarse yellow-orange mycelium on the wood. Coprinellus truncorum is also covered with glistening granules and {{is said to be}} almost indistinguishable from C.micaceus in the field; microscopy is needed to tell the difference, as C.truncorum has ellipsoid spores with a rounded germ pore, compared to the shield-shaped (mitriform) spores with truncated germ pores of C.micaceus. One study suggests that compared to C.truncorum, C.micaceus is browner {{in the center of the}} cap (rather than grayish) and has a greater tendency to grow in clusters; more molecular evidence is required to determine if the two taxa are genetically identical.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{begins with}} an unknown person {{lighting}} a candle in the homicide squadroom. One by one, the detectives arrive for the night shift on an unusually hot September evening. A furious Gee (Yaphet Kotto) calls maintenance {{to complain about the}} non-working air conditioner and learns it has been shut off for the night. Felton (Daniel Baldwin) and Lewis (Clark Johnson) try to find out who secretly lights the candle every night; they blow it out a number of times, but <b>it</b> <b>always</b> ends up lit again without anyone noticing. Munch (Richard Belzer) loudly complains about his ex-girlfriend breaking up with him. While the other detectives sweat and complain about the heat, a calm and comfortable Pembleton (Andre Braugher) wears a tie and drinks hot tea without sweating. Bayliss (Kyle Secor), who acts uncooperative with his partner Pembleton, says he has found the fingerprints of a man named James Hill who he believes is the murderer in the Adena Watson case. Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) brings in Hill, who {{turns out to be a}} 12-year-old boy (Kenny Blank), much to the amusement of the other detectives.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} idea was based around {{the premise of}} creating a town like those found in a role-playing game. The team chose the design elements of a fractured, floating world due to their wish to portray a sky in the game, which is usually not possible with an isometric camera, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> points down. They also wanted to forgo a map system, and felt that having the ground {{come up to the}} Kid allowed the player to easily see without a map where they had already been in a level. The story of the Calamity was created as a way to explain this game mechanic. Jen Zee developed the art style of the game to express beauty in a post-apocalyptic landscape. The hand-painted style was intended to soften the sharpness she saw as typical in isometric games and the colorless, harsh depictions of most devastated landscapes. Zee was inspired by the pixel art landscapes of earlier Japanese isometric games.|$|E
5|$|When {{an object}} is in {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium, a global layer of liquid covering its surface would form a liquid {{surface of the}} same shape as the body, apart from small-scale surface features such as craters and fissures. If the body does not rotate, {{it will be a}} sphere, but the faster it rotates, the more oblate or even scalene it becomes. If such a rotating body were to be heated until it melted, its overall shape would not change when liquid. The extreme example of a non-spherical body in hydrostatic equilibrium is , which is twice as long along its major axis as it is at the poles. If the body has a massive nearby companion, then tidal forces come into effect as well, distorting it into a prolate spheroid. An example of this is Jupiter's moon Io, which is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System due to effects of tidal heating. Tidal forces also cause a body's rotation to gradually become tidally locked, such that <b>it</b> <b>always</b> presents the same face to its companion. An extreme example of this is the Pluto–Charon system, where both bodies are tidally locked to each other. Earth's Moon is also tidally locked, as are many satellites of the gas giants.|$|E
