2500|$|The {{history of}} General Electric {{provides}} a clear example of developing orthogonal performance measures. When GE dismantled its conglomerate in the 1950s, its existing performance measures, which relied on centralized budgetary targets, needed to evolve {{to suit the}} newly decentralized company. The 1951 GE Measurement Project provided a template for the new performance measures, which were orthogonal to the old performance measures, {{as well as to}} each other. The new measures were [...] "profitability, market position, productivity, product leadership, personnel development, employee attitudes, public responsibility", and balance between short-term and long-term goals. Thirty years later, when the company was in dire straits, the performance measurements were functionally consolidated into ranked profitability and growth. With this strategy, GE annually swept away the bottom 10% of its performers in profitability and growth. Once GE regained financial and market stability, the performance evaluation metrics changed in response, allegedly expanding and taking on more humanistic values. GE illustrates two <b>important</b> <b>notes</b> about changing performance metrics. First, new performance measures are most useful when they are unrelated {{to each other and to}} existing measures. Second, performance measures tend towards elaboration during times of security and profitability, and likewise tend towards consolidation during times of urgency and strain.|$|E

His discovery of {{the remains of a}} true Equus afforded a remarkable confirmation of the fact- -already made out in North America--that species of horse had existed and become extinct in the New World, before their introduction by the Spaniards in the sixteenth century. Fully perceiving the importance of the microscope in studying the nature and origin of such deposits as those of the Pampas, Darwin submitted many of his specimens both to Dr. Carpenter in this country, and to Professor Ehrenberg in Berlin.
