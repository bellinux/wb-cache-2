During the period 1995 - 99, the appreciation of the domestic currency contributed to reducing inflation, whereas excessive wage increases prevented inflation from decreasing to a lower level. ...|$|R

50|$|Ratios {{relating}} {{reserves to}} other <b>external</b> <b>sector</b> variables are popular among credit risk agencies {{and international organizations}} to assess the external vulnerability of a country. For example, Article IV of 2013 uses total external debt to gross international reserves, gross international reserves in months of prospective goods and nonfactor services imports to broad money, broad money to short-term external debt, and short-term external debt to short-term external debt on residual maturity basis plus current account deficit. Therefore, countries with similar characteristics accumulate reserves to avoid negative assessment by the financial market, especially when compared to members of a peer group.|$|E
