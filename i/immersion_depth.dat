40|$|With the {{demonstration}} of the viability of using the electroslag remelting process for the decontamination of radionuclides, interest has increased in examining the unique aspects associated with melting steel pipe electrodes. These electrodes consist of several nested pipes, welded concentrically to atop plate. Since these electrodes can be half as dense as a solid electrode, they present unique challenges to the standard algorithms used in controlling the melting process. Naturally the electrode must be driven down at a dramatically increased speed. However, since the heat transfer is greatly influenced and enhanced with the increased area to volume ratio, considerable variation in the melting rate of the pipes has been found. Standard control methods can become unstable {{as a result of}} the variation at increased speeds, particularly at shallow <b>immersion</b> <b>depths.</b> The key to good control lies in the understanding of the melting process. Several experiments were conducted to observe the characteristics of the melting using two different control modes. By using a pressure transducer to monitor the pressure inside the pipes, the venting of the air trapped inside the electrode was observed. The measurements reveal that for a considerable amount of time. the pipes are not completely immersed in the slag, allowing the gas inside to escape without the formation of bubbles.

40|$|Goniometric {{techniques}} traditionally quantify two parameters, {{the advancing}} and receding contact angles, that {{are useful for}} characterizing the wetting properties of a solid surface; however, dynamic tensiometry, which measures changes in the net force on a surface during the repeated immersion and emersion of a solid into a probe liquid, can provide further insight into the wetting properties of a surface. We detail a framework for analyzing tensiometric results that allows for the determination of wetting hysteresis, wetting state transitions, and characteristic topographical length scales on textured, nonwetting surfaces, {{in addition to the}} more traditional measurement of apparent advancing and receding contact angles. Fluorodecyl POSS, a low-surface-energy material, was blended with commercially available poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and then dip- or spray-coated onto glass substrates. These surfaces were probed with a variety of liquids to illustrate the effects of probe liquid surface tension, solid surface chemistry, and surface texture on the apparent contact angles and wetting hysteresis of nonwetting surfaces. Woven meshes were then used as model structured substrates to add a second, larger length scale for the surface texture. When immersed into a probe liquid, these spray-coated mesh surfaces can form a metastable, solid–liquid–air interface on the largest length scale of surface texture. The increasing hydrostatic pressure associated with progressively greater <b>immersion</b> <b>depths</b> disrupts this metastable, composite interface and forces penetration of the probe liquid into the mesh structure. This transition is marked by a sudden change in the wetting hysteresis, which can be systematically probed using spray-coated, woven meshes of varying wire radius and spacing.

Gears are the main components in vehicle transmissions and although they are already highly efficient, there is still room for improvement. In this study, the focus falls on the lubricant used to create separating films between gears and todissipate heat. When driving, the gears churn this lubricant, giving rise to power losses {{that are related to}} the amount and properties of the lubricant. However, any attempt to reduce these losses must not compromise the required lubrication and heat dissipation. Paper A reports on the use of an FZG gear test rig to investigate power losses and heat generation for different gear <b>immersion</b> <b>depths,</b> surface roughness and coatings. The results show that lower gear roughness reduces gear mesh losses and heat generation. A polishing affect was obtained when a non-coated gear ran against a coated gear.

The kinetic EPR data of CLS, n-DSA (n= 5, 7, 12, and 16), and M 2 δ AChR peptide spin-labeled at Glu- 1 and Ala- 12 revealed excellent exponential and linear fits.

40|$|Biological {{membranes}} form {{a protective}} barrier around cells and cellular compartments. A {{broad range of}} biochemical processes occur in or at membranes demonstrating {{that they are not}} only of structural but also of functional importance. One important class of membrane proteins are membrane-associated glycosyltransferases. WaaG is a representative of this class of proteins; its function is to catalyze one step in the synthesis of lipopolysaccharides, which are outer membrane lipids found in Gram-negative bacteria. To study protein-membrane complexes by biophysical methods, one must employ membrane mimetics, i. e. simplifications of natural membranes. One type of membrane mimetic often employed in solution-state NMR is small isotropic bicelles, obloid aggregates formed from a lipid bilayer that is dissolved in aqueous solvent by detergent molecules that make up the rim of the bicelle. In this thesis, fast dynamics of lipid atoms in bicelles containing lipid mixtures that faithfully mimic plant and bacterial membranes were investigated by NMR relaxation. Lipids were observed to undergo a broad range of motions; while the glycerol backbone was found to be rigid, dynamics in the acyl chains were much more rapid and unrestricted. Furthermore, by employing paramagnetic relaxation enhancements an ‘atomic ruler’ was developed that allows for measurement of the <b>immersion</b> <b>depths</b> of lipid carbon atoms. WaaG is a membrane-associated protein that adopts a GT-B fold. For proteins of this type, it has been speculated that the N-terminal domain anchors tightly to the membrane via electrostatic interactions, while the anchoring of the C-terminal domain is weaker. Here, this model was tested for WaaG. It was found by a set of circular dichroism, fluorescence, and NMR techniques that an anchoring segment located in the N-terminal domain termed MIR-WaaG binds electrostatically to membranes, and the structure and localization of isolated MIR-WaaG inside micelles was determined. Full-length WaaG was also found to bind membranes electrostatically. It senses the surface charge density of the membrane whilst not discriminating between anionic lipid species. Motion of the C-terminal domain could not be observed under the experimental conditions used here. Lastly, the affinity of WaaG to membranes is lower than expected, indicating that WaaG should not be classified as a monotopic membrane protein but rather as a peripheral one.

While the increase in practice and popularity of CWI has led to multiple studies and reviews in the area of water immersion, this research has predominantly focused on performance outcomes associated with post-exercise CWI. Studies to date have generally shown positive results with enhanced recovery of performance. However, there are a small number of studies which have shown CWI to have either no effect or a detrimental effect on the recovery of performance. The rationale for such contradictory responses has received little attention but may be related to nuances associated with the individual which may need to be accounted for in optimising prescription of protocols. In order to recommend optimal protocols to enhance athletic recovery, research must provide a greater understanding of the physiology underpinning performance change and the factors which may contribute to the varied responses currently observed. This review focuses specifically on why some of the current literature may show variability and disparity in the effectiveness of CWI for recovery of athletic performance by examining the body temperature and cardiovascular responses underpinning CWI and how these are related to performance benefits.
