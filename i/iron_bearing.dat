500|$|Phoebe, at [...] in diameter, {{is by far}} {{the largest}} of Saturn's {{irregular}} satellites. It has a retrograde orbit and rotates on its axis every 9.3 hours. Phoebe was the first moon of Saturn to be studied in detail by Cassini, in during this encounter Cassini was able to map nearly 90% of the moon's surface. Phoebe has a nearly spherical shape and a relatively high density of about 1.6g/cm3. Cassini images revealed a dark surface scarred by numerous impacts—there are about 130 craters with diameters exceeding 10km. Spectroscopic measurement showed that the surface is made of water ice, carbon dioxide, phyllosilicates, organics and possibly <b>iron</b> <b>bearing</b> minerals. Phoebe is believed to be a captured centaur that originated in the Kuiper belt. It also serves as a source of material for the largest known ring of Saturn, which darkens the leading hemisphere of Iapetus (see above).|$|E
