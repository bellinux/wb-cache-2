500|$|During {{the period}} 1974–1975, FANK forces officially grew from 100,000 to {{approximately}} 250,000 men, but probably only numbered around 180,000 due to payroll padding by their officers {{and due to}} desertions. U.S. military aid (ammunition, supplies, and equipment) was funneled to FANK through the Military Equipment Delivery Team, Cambodia (MEDTC). Authorized a total of 113 officers and men, the team arrived in Phnom Penh in 1971, under the overall command of CINCPAC Admiral John S. McCain, Jr. [...] The attitude of the Nixon administration could be summed up by the advice given by Henry Kissinger to the first head of the liaison team, Colonel Jonathan Ladd: [...] "Don't think of victory; <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> alive." [...] Nevertheless, McCain constantly petitioned the Pentagon for more arms, equipment, and staff for what he proprietarily viewed as [...] "my war".|$|E
500|$|Insane Clown Posse {{is known}} for their {{elaborate}} concert performances. In Marley Brant's Tales from the Rock 'n' Roll Highway, Bruce described a typical performance: [...] "We toss out, kick out, and shoot out into the crowd about three to four hundred two-liters of Faygo at every show...We bring with us monsters, dancing clowns, girls, trampolines, and pure and absolute madness to the stage...Shaggy and I know that without all that crazy shit going on around us, we'd just be two more idiots walking back and forth, rapping on stage...ICP's motto has always been 'Fuck keepin' it real: we <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> entertaining.'" [...] Performances feature backdrops including, among other settings, a game show set and a cemetery. Bruce stated, [...] "We always have a different set, not only for Hallowicked but every tour we go out on. We've been around so long that we get to dig up the many cool sets that we used {{back in the day}} and then get to use them again on a national level. Something we might've done once in '94 at St. Andrew's Hall, we can go back again and now do it nationwide-style".|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Creep" [...] {{is set in}} {{the time}} {{signature}} of common time with a moderate tempo of 96 beats per minute. It was composed in the traditional verse–chorus form in the key of C minor with Watkins and Thomas' vocals ranging from the chords of C4 to F5. [...] "Yes, it's me again / And, I'm back," [...] Watkins introduces herself while opening the track in a [...] "husky" [...] voice. She then repeats the lines [...] "oh-I, oh-I, oh-I", which was compared by Spin Terry Sutton to Watkins finding [...] "a spiritual instruction in vowel sounds," [...] before going to the first verse of the song. In the first verse, the singer counts her relationship's [...] "twenty-second of loneliness" [...] and expresses how she still loves her boyfriend even acknowledging that he has been cheating on her. Moving on to the song's bridge, she suddenly uses a lower register to [...] "nonchalantly" [...] reveal: [...] "I'll never leave him down, though I might mess around / It's only cause I need some affection." [...] "So I creep / Yeah / And I'll <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> on the down low," [...] she low-key sings the hook as if she is [...] "confessing to a chosen few." [...] Opening up the second verse, Watkins again counting her [...] "twenty-third of loneliness" [...] and still talks about her love for the partner despite signs of a broken romance. After performing the chorus again, her fellow member Thomas joins in to [...] "sweetly" [...] reveal the reason why's she cheating around is because she needs some attention from her lover. Watkins finally ends the track with the lines [...] "I creep around because I need attention / I don't mess around with my affection" [...] while fading out with the heavy beat and the horn sample. Billboard Larry Flick said the two's vocals in the track were [...] "tightly woven" [...] and [...] "rife with raspy grit," [...] which gave a nice contrast to the song's horn sample and funk guitars.|$|E

[...] Dan Nigro and Nate Campany composed the [...] "happier-sounding" [...] instrumental, to which Jepsen felt a sense of catharsis in concealing a [...] "very serious" [...] emotion. Ariel Rechsthaid reworked the chord progression in order to invoke a sense of [...] "desperation", droning through it with a series of bell notes that made the composition sound [...] "a little bit more somber". The [...] "five-string, funk-R" [...] bass line was played by Ethan Farmer, and the drum fill, [...] "an 80s kind-of snare with a big reverb on it," [...] was inspired by John Mellencamp's [...] "Jack & Diane". Rechsthaid further directed Jepsen's ad-libs on the track: [...] " [...] producers really love to capture those moments where you say an awkward thing and for their own, sick pleasure <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> in there, tucked." ...|$|E
